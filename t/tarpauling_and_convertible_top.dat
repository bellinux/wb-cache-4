50|$|The {{windscreen}} <b>and</b> <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> {{had been}} adapted from those {{used on the}} Jensen-Healey roadster. Because Jensen Motors had ceased operation in 1976, the windscreen and sidecurtain designs were done by a company named Jensen Special Products, which was run by former Jensen employees. The design for the <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> was finalised by Car Hood Company in Coventry.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "Hydro-Electric" [...] system (windows, {{front seat}} {{adjustment}} <b>and</b> <b>convertible</b> <b>top)</b> was standard on 1947 model year. The seat and window assist system became available on GM closed cars (standard on some Cadillac Series 75 models and all Series 60 Specials, commonly called [...] "Fleetwood" [...] {{beginning with the}} 1948). The full system was standard only on the high-end GM convertibles made by Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac. It was only available as a package; that is, power assisted windows, front seat, <b>and</b> <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> (where applicable). This feature can be identified in 1948 and later General Motors model numbers with an [...] "X" [...] at the end, such as the 1951 Cadillac Sixty Special sedan, model 6019X. The electrically operated hydraulic pump system was shared by Hudson and Packard for their 1948 through 1950 models. The driver's door contained four buttons {{in addition to the}} remaining individual windows.|$|R

At least one open car was subsequently fitted with a removable hardtop by S.H. Arnolt. Prices as per a 1956 factory letter were $3995 for the competition model, $4245 for the bolide, $4995 for the deluxe and $5995 for the coupe.|$|R
5000|$|Though a 2-seater {{roadster}} {{in general}} design, the rear decklid can be lifted to reveal two extra seats. One {{of the most}} desirable features of the Bengal is its voice activated controls. The car is able to distinguish over 100 commands given to it by voice, which can operate various things from the headlights, windshield wipers, <b>and</b> <b>convertible</b> <b>top,</b> to the heater, navigation system, seat adjustments, and cruise control. The system was named Quiet Servant and it was developed by Visteon Corporation. The dashboard is free of traditional gauges, everything instead is displayed on demand on a single flat panel screen.|$|R
50|$|The 1996 Cobra was {{available}} in four exterior paint colors, {{as shown in the}} table below. Interior color choices were the same as before: Black cloth, Saddle cloth, Black leather, and Saddle leather.

50|$|The 1995 Cobra was {{available}} in the same three exterior paint colors from 1994, {{as shown in the}} table below. Interior color choices were the same as in 1994: Black cloth, Saddle cloth, Black leather, and Saddle leather. On the 1995 Cobra <b>convertible,</b> the vinyl <b>top</b> was only available in black, <b>and</b> this <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> was the same one used on regular Mustang convertibles.|$|R
5000|$|The 1953 Skylark was {{handmade}} in many respects. Only stampings for the hood, {{trunk lid}} and {{a portion of}} the convertible tub were shared with the Roadmaster <b>and</b> Super <b>convertibles.</b> All Skylark tubs were finished with various amounts of lead filler. The inner doors were made by cutting the 2-door Roadmaster's in two then welding the pieces back together at an angle to produce the rakish door dip. An overall more streamlined look was reinforced by cutting the windshield almost 3 in shorter and lowering the side windows <b>and</b> <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> frame proportionately. Seat frames and steering column were then dropped to provide proper headroom and driving position. Front leg room was 44.7 in. Authentic wire wheels were produced by Kelsey-Hayes, chromed everywhere except the plated and painted [...] "Skylark" [...] center emblem.|$|R
50|$|The {{functions}} of a remote {{keyless entry system}} are contained on a key fob or built into the ignition key handle itself. Buttons are dedicated to locking or unlocking the doors and opening the trunk or tailgate. On some minivans, the power sliding doors can be opened/closed remotely. Some cars will also close any open windows and roof when remotely locking the car. Some remote keyless fobs also feature a red panic button which activates the car alarm as a standard feature. Further adding to the convenience, some cars' engines with remote keyless ignition systems can be started by {{the push of a}} button on the key fob (useful in cold weather), <b>and</b> <b>convertible</b> <b>tops</b> can be raised and lowered from outside the vehicle while it's parked.|$|R
50|$|The {{only other}} major changes for 1997 {{was in the}} color palette. The 1997 Cobra was {{available}} in four exterior colors, {{as shown in the}} table below. The interior choices were the same as what was offered in 1996: Black cloth, Saddle cloth, Black leather, and Saddle leather. On Cobra <b>convertibles,</b> the vinyl <b>top</b> was again available in black, saddle, or white, <b>and</b> this <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> was the same one used on regular Mustang convertibles.|$|R
50|$|The 1998 Cobra was {{available}} in five exterior colors, {{as shown in the}} table below. Chrome Yellow was added midyear on the 1998 Cobra. The interior choices were the same as before: Black cloth, Saddle cloth, Black leather, and Saddle leather. However, the leather pattern changed. On Cobra <b>convertibles,</b> the vinyl <b>top</b> was again available in black, saddle, or white, <b>and</b> this <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> was the same one used on regular Mustang convertibles.|$|R
50|$|The 1994 Cobra was {{available}} in three exterior paint colors, {{as shown in the}} table below. Interior color choices were Black cloth, Saddle cloth, Black leather, and Saddle leather. On the 1994 Cobra convertible (see the next section about the 1994 Indy 500 Pace Car Replica), the vinyl top was only available in saddle, <b>and</b> this <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> was the same one used on regular Mustang convertibles.|$|R
50|$|Designed in 1984, the R129 {{was based}} on the {{shortened}} floorpan of the Mercedes-Benz W124 and featured many innovative details for the time, for instance electronically controlled damping (Adaptive Damping System ADS, optional) and a hidden, automatically extending roll-over bar. The R107's somewhat dated rear suspension with semi-trailing arms gave way to a modern multi-link axle. The number of standard features was high, with electric action for the windows, mirrors, seats <b>and</b> hydraulic <b>convertible</b> <b>top.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Model I was {{approved}} for limited flight, {{in the experimental}} category. by the CAA, managing to accumulate 500 miles of road driving, and flying {{for the first time}} in 1953. The improved Model II achieved 80 hours of flight time and 4000 miles of road travel before a road accident. During repairs the Model II was rebuilt with two-seats becoming the Model III Autoplane, with a Continental A75 engine <b>and</b> <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> motors, from a Chevrolet Corvair, to extend and fold the wings. After accumulating 70 hours of flight time and 1000 road miles, the Model III crashed during a flyby at the 1974 Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) airshow, at Oshkosh, Wisconsin, when an inadequately secured wing section parted company killing the designer. At the time of his death Leland Bryan was in the process of designing the Model IV Autoplane, based on a Rutan VariViggen.|$|R
50|$|The 1999 Cobra was {{available}} in four exterior paint colors, {{as shown in the}} table below. Interior color choices were limited to two offerings: Dark Charcoal and Medium Parchment. The standard leather seats were the same optional leather units used in the 1999 Mustang GT, but without the embroidered running pony logo on the front seatbacks. Cloth seats were no longer offered on the Cobra, as they were never popular with buyers in previous model years. On Cobra <b>convertibles,</b> the vinyl <b>top</b> {{was available}} in black, parchment, or white, <b>and</b> this <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> was the same one used on regular 1999 Mustang convertibles.|$|R
25|$|MY07: models {{appeared}} in January 2007, {{coinciding with the}} release of the Astra SRi <b>and</b> Twin <b>Top</b> <b>convertible.</b> Both releases came with a more powerful 2.2-litre Z22YH petrol engine producing , available with the six-speed manual or four-speed automatic.|$|R
50|$|The Anderson was a United States automobile; {{considered}} the most successful automobile ever built in the Southern United States, it was manufactured by a carriage works from 1916 to 1925 in Rock Hill, South Carolina. Started by John Gary Anderson, the company sold cars through a national dealer network. The company used Continental 7R flat six engines in its vehicles, which were noted for their attractive body styles and color combinations. Andersons were the first cars to be built with headlight foot dimmers <b>and</b> powered <b>convertible</b> <b>tops.</b> Production reached nearly 2,000 units in 1923 and in all 7,000 vehicles were produced during {{the life of the}} company.|$|R
50|$|The 2001 Cobra was {{available}} in eight exterior paint colors, {{as shown in the}} table below. There were only two interior color choices: Dark Charcoal (the interior environment was Dark Charcoal, and the seats had Dark Charcoal leather bolsters with Medium Graphite alcantara inserts) or Medium Parchment (the interior environment was Medium Parchment, but the seats had Chocolate Brown leather bolsters with Medium Parchment alcantara inserts). In keeping with SVT's attention to detail, the Cobra emblem on the front seatbacks was embroidered in a somewhat darker color than the suede inserts to provide a subtle contrast. On Cobra <b>convertibles,</b> the vinyl <b>top</b> {{was available}} in black, parchment, or white, <b>and</b> this <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> was the same one used on regular 2001 Mustang convertibles.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{increase}} in width and the IRS badge on {{the rear of the}} car, other changes included a revised grille and new hood badge. There was also a new line of chrome trim on the side, starting near the rear edge of the door and ending {{at the front of the}} car with integrated signal/marker lights, which were moved from their earlier position in the corners of the grille. New smaller front bumpers <b>and</b> a <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> patterned after the one from the Herald completed the exterior differences. On the interior the fly-off handbrake lever was moved to the transmission tunnel between two revised seats, the gearshift lever was shortened and the white painted steel dashboard was now always covered by walnut, which had been optional in the TR4.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "engineer" [...] {{body had}} three bench seats {{for the crew}} <b>and</b> a <b>convertible</b> canvas <b>top</b> was mounted at {{the upper part of}} the rear body. It {{fastened}} to the windshield when erected. Side pieces could be mounted to protect the crew from the weather. There was a storage compartment at the rear of the vehicle, underneath the crew seats. Photographic evidence shows both [...] "artillery" [...] and [...] "engineer" [...] versions were used by artillery units.|$|R
5000|$|Built {{primarily}} with racing in mind, the aluminium-bodied [...] "100S" [...] (for Sebring) model developed [...] at 4700 rpm. Only 50 production cars were made, plus an additional five works development/special test cars hand {{built by the}} Donald Healey Motor Company at Warwick. To minimize weight and improve performance the cast iron cylinder head {{was replaced by a}} Weslake designed aluminium one, and the overdrive unit was not installed. Dunlop disc brakes were used all-round, the world's first production car to feature them both front and rear. To further lighten the vehicle, bumpers <b>and</b> hood (<b>convertible</b> <b>top)</b> were eliminated, the grille reduced in size, and the windscreen made of plastic. In all, weight was reduced by approximately 200 lb. The majority of 100Ss were two-toned white with Lobelia Blue sides. A handful were produced in solid Spruce Green and red, and a single one in black.|$|R
50|$|The Präsident was an {{automobile}} manufactured by Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau-Fabriks-Gesellschaft A.G. (NW, {{now known as}} Tatra) in 1897. It was the first actually drivable factory made petrol-engined automobile produced in Austria-Hungary {{as well as in}} Central and Eastern Europe (save the attempt of Siegfried Marcus of Vienna to build a self-propelled car in 1875). It was constructed by Leopold Sviták and Hans Ledwinka. The automobile was more of a carriage without horses than a car in modern sense. The car is steered via handlebars (while most of the cars of the era had a tiller). The wooden bodywork is placed on an iron frame. It has four seats <b>and</b> a <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> that would cover only the rear seats. Both axles have suspension of semi-elliptical leaf springs. The wheels were similar to the ones of a horse carriage, but had rubber tyres. The car had a two cylinder spark ignition Benz engine placed by the rear axle.|$|R
5000|$|Siata {{introduced}} the Siata 208S in 1953 featuring Fiat's 2.0 liter 8V engine. 35 cars were produced between 1953 and 1955 priced at 5300 dollars available in both <b>convertible</b> <b>and</b> hard <b>top.</b> The car rose to prominence after actor and race car driver Steve McQueen purchased model BS523 from Los Angeles-based Siata importer Ernie McCaffe in the mid-1950s. McQueen reportedly re badged {{the car with}} Ferrari emblems and dubbed the car his [...] "Little Ferrari".|$|R
50|$|The Cobra {{convertible}} returned {{this year}} for a limited production run of 1,003 units, and all were painted Black and fitted with Saddle leather interiors <b>and</b> Black <b>convertible</b> <b>tops.</b> Newly available for the 1995 Cobra convertible was a removable hardtop option. This was a one-year-only option due to its $1,825 price and 90 pounds of additional weight; thus, only 499 of the 1,003 Cobra convertibles built this year had this option. Removing or installing the hardtop was a two-person job, and this hardtop could not easily fit any other Mustang or Cobra convertible from this vintage due to the latching mechanisms of the fiberglass top and the dome light wiring. Included with this option, a convenient carrier that rolled on four casters allowed for easier storage of the hardtop when it was not being used. This hardtop option was originally {{supposed to be an}} available option for the all-new 1994 Mustang convertible, but it was delayed due to supply problems and quality-control concerns. This hardtop option was also available on the 1995 Mustang GT convertible.|$|R
50|$|Exhibited at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1976, and {{included}} {{in the range from}} that year was the Aero-Kadett, an open-top Kadett with targa roll bar, detachable roof insert <b>and</b> a separate <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> aft of the roll bar (like the contemporary Lancia Beta Spider). This car was built in limited numbers by Karosserie Baur in Stuttgart. Removing the removable parts of the Kadett Aero's roof was a cumbersome process and the manufacturer's recommended retail price was very much higher than that asked by Volkswagen for their 1303 Cabriolet. The Kadett Aero struggled to find buyers, and was withdrawn early in 1978 by which time 1,242 had been produced. Several decades later, however, the rarity of the Kadett Aero is one of the features that helps it to draw continued interest from old-timer enthusiasts.|$|R
2500|$|The model line-up for 1970 {{initially}} featured 13 models. The {{base model}} was the [...] "Fairlane 500", which {{was available in}} a 2-door hardtop, 4-door sedan, and 4-door wagon. Next was the mid-level [...] "Torino", which was available as a 2-door and 4-door hardtop, and a 4-door sedan and station wagon. The 4-door pillarless hardtop was a new body style for the 1970 model year (Chevrolet introduced this body style for its intermediate Chevelle starting in 1966). The [...] "Torino Brougham" [...] was the top trim level, and was available as a 2-door and 4-door hardtop, and a 4-door station wagon. The sporty [...] "Torino GT" [...] was available as a 2-door SportsRoof <b>and</b> <b>convertible.</b> Finally, the <b>top</b> performance model, the [...] "Torino Cobra" [...] was available as a 2-door SportsRoof only.|$|R
50|$|The Cadillac Series 62 Coupe de Ville was {{introduced}} {{late in the}} 1949 model year. Along with the Buick Roadmaster Riviera, and the Oldsmobile 98 Holiday, it {{was among the first}} pillarless hardtop coupes ever produced. At $3,496 it was only a dollar less than the Series 62 <b>convertible,</b> <b>and</b> like the <b>convertible,</b> it came with power windows standard. It was luxuriously trimmed, with leather upholstery and chrome 'bows' in the headliner to simulate the ribs of a <b>convertible</b> <b>top.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Shortly before World War II, General Motors {{developed}} a central hydraulic pump for working <b>convertible</b> <b>tops.</b> This system was introduced on 1942 convertibles built by GM.
