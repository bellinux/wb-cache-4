5|$|Lutosławski's {{formidable}} technical developments {{grew out}} of his creative imperative; that he left a lasting body of major compositions is a <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> his resolution of purpose {{in the face of}} the anti-formalist authorities under which he formulated his methods.|$|E
5|$|Bowen and the Spurs {{bounced back}} {{and won the}} NBA title in 2005, {{defeating}} the Detroit Pistons. The Spurs could not win back-to-back titles, however, and bowed out 4–3 in a seven-game series against the Dallas Mavericks in the 2006 NBA Playoffs. As a <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> his controversial style of play, Bowen picked up a $10,000 NBA fine for kicking Ray Allen in the back during a March 2006 game.|$|E

5|$|Camelot Software Planning spent between {{twelve and}} {{eighteen}} months developing Golden Sun, {{which is considered}} {{a long time for}} a handheld video game; the finished product was described as a <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> the positive results a long development cycle can bring to a game. In August 2000, Camelot showed an early but playable version at the Nintendo Spaceworld Expo in Japan. North American reviewers received the game {{a few weeks before the}} release, and IGN noted that the experience of developing Shining Force for Sega helped Camelot develop a gripping RPG for the handheld.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral {{has been}} a focus of Mexican {{cultural}} identity, and is a <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> its colonial history. Researcher Manuel Rivera Cambas reported that the cathedral {{was built on the}} site sacred precinct of the Aztecs and with the very stones of their temples so that the Spaniards could lay claim to the land and the people. Hernán Cortés supposedly laid the first stone of the original church personally.|$|E
5|$|The {{coaching}} stock was extremely solidly constructed, and offered levels of accommodation {{far in advance}} of anything else at the time - certainly compared to any other narrow gauge railway. Almost 70 years later, the design {{was used as the}} basis for a new rake of carriages built by the Ffestiniog - <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> the excellence of the original design.|$|E
50|$|The Church St. Nicholas of Wismar {{was built}} from 1381 until 1487 {{as a church}} for sailors and fishermen. St. Nicholas {{is one of the}} finest <b>testaments</b> <b>to</b> mediaeval brick {{architecture}} in northern Germany.|$|R

5|$|The {{expedition}} ship Scotia was requisitioned {{during the}} Great War, and saw {{service as a}} freighter. On 18 January 1916 she caught fire, and was burned out on a sandbank in the Bristol Channel. One hundred years after Bruce, a 2003 expedition, in a modern version of Scotia, used information collected by the SNAE {{as a basis for}} examining climate change in South Georgia during the past century. This expedition asserted that its contribution to the international debate on global warming would be a fitting <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> the SNAE's pioneering research.|$|E
5|$|The {{opinion that}} Eclogue 4 was a {{reference}} to the coming of Jesus was not universally held by early members of the early Church, however. St. Jerome, an early Church writer noted for translating the Bible into Latin, specifically wrote that Virgil could not have been a Christian prophet without having accepted Christ, and claimed that anyone that had accepted that Virgil was a pre-Christian prophet was being childish. Classicist Ella Bourne, however, noted that the mere fact that St. Jerome responded to the idea is a <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> the belief's pervasiveness.|$|E
5|$|While Bobby Dodd was a {{determined}} competitor, he cared deeply {{for those who}} played for him. Unlike some other coaches, {{he did not believe}} in winning at any costs; he truly believed that {{the most important aspect of}} college football was the college football player. As a <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> the character of Bobby Dodd, each year a Division I college coach whose team excels on the field, in the classroom, and in the community is awarded the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award, presented by the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Foundation.|$|E

50|$|In 1984 the Kentucky Poetry Review posthumously {{published}} {{a volume of}} her work entitled, The Encircling Thread. Her poems are moving <b>testaments</b> <b>to</b> the lifelong tension she felt for the traditions which she both honored and rebelled against.|$|R
5000|$|Allmusic {{reviewer}} Thom Jurek wrote, [...] "Once Upon a Rhyme and its predecessor, The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy, established Coe {{as a major}} songwriting force; {{they remain}} enduring <b>testaments</b> <b>to</b> his songwriting brilliance as a criminally under-examined talent in the country tradition." ...|$|R
5|$|A further <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> this devotion {{included}} Hasan-Jalal's commissioning of the Gandzasar Monastery. Construction of {{the monastery}} began in 1216 and lasted until 1238. On July 22, 1240, amid great celebration during Vardavar celebrations and {{in the presence of}} nearly 700 priests including Nerses, the Catholicos of Albania, the church was consecrated. The monastery {{went on to become the}} residence and sepulcher of the family as well as the house of the catholicos; beginning in the 15th century, the family also monopolized control over the seat of Catholicos itself, which would from thereon in pass down from uncle to nephew. Hasan-Jalal's son John VII is considered to be the first to have established this practice when he became the Catholicos whereas his nephew, also named John, became the second.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20thcentury, the teachings of Tenrikyo's foundress Oyasama became popular throughout Japan. In the following decades, the most devoted followers coalesced around Oyasama's residence in rural Nara, which she had perceived as the birthplace of the world, or Jiba. The six villages surrounding the Jiba slowly became filled with Tenrikyo ministers, mystics, and evangelists, and the area was urbanized. A popular international school (now Tenri University) and Tenri Central Library, built by followers, were also attracting a variety of people to the area. It was around this time that Tenrikyo's Second Shinbashira (community leader) Shōzen Nakayama conceived of creating a grand construction project as a <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> the loyalty of Oyasama's followers.|$|E
5|$|Denard Robinson had {{perhaps his}} worst game {{up to this}} point in the season: he threw three interceptions and was held to only 84 yards rushing. This marked the first time that Michigan State had {{defeated}} Michigan {{three years in a row}} since they accomplished this feat from 1965–1967. The announced crowd of 113,065 was, at the time, the second largest crowd ever at Michigan Stadium. As a <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> Michigan's ongoing kicking woes, the field goal in the first half was Michigan's first attempt since the game against UMass and the first converted kick since the game against Connecticut.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, there are [...] "instant memoires" [...] of direct {{witnesses}} like the antisemitic and dishonest book of Esterházy, {{or those of}} Alfred Dreyfus himself in Five years of my life. These are <b>testaments</b> <b>to</b> complete the panorama of the Affair.|$|R

5|$|Following {{the title}} win, Chapman kept faith with his squad, making only one new signing – outside right Joey Williams – as they {{successfully}} defended their League title in 1924–25. Huddersfield started brightly but a poor run of form in October and November (in part {{caused by an}} injury to goalkeeper Ted Taylor) saw them drop to ninth at one point. Taylor was replaced by new signing Billy Mercer and a resurgence in form saw Huddersfield climb the table, regaining top spot with a 5–0 win over Arsenal in February, and eventually finishing two points clear of runners-up West Bromwich Albion. As a <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> Chapman's philosophy of relying on a strong defence, {{it was the first}} time a title-winning side had gone through a season without conceding more than two goals in any match.|$|E
5|$|However, out at {{the site}} of the accident, it was {{discovered}} that the bags of cement had solidified and had to be separated before the BX could be raised and the salvage could not be completed before freeze-up. In the spring of 1920, the salvage work was completed and at a cost of $40,000 the BX was raised and patched sufficiently to get her back to Fort George. The newly overhauled BC Express pushed her back upstream through the Fort George Canyon and to the shipyard at Fort George. This would be the first time in the history of sternwheelers that one would push another upriver through a canyon. That it could be accomplished was a fitting <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> the craftsmanship of Alexander Watson Jr and the skill of Captain Browne and Captain Bucey.|$|E
5|$|In 1968 John Betjeman made a {{television}} film called A Poet Goes North {{in which he}} gave his opinion on the changing architecture of Leeds. Betjeman described the constant sound of falling Victorian architecture. Betjeman also lambasted British Railways House (now City House) saying it blocked all the light out to City Square and was only a <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> money and had no architectural merit of its own. Betjeman also praised Leeds Town Hall in the film. The film, which was never broadcast at the time, was preserved by Leeds Civic Trust and has been restored by the Yorkshire Film Archive. It was screened {{as part of the}} Leeds International Film Festival in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The first clear <b>testaments</b> <b>to</b> Christian {{communities}} in Switzerland date after 313, when the religion was officially tolerated with the Edict of Milan. It is however certain that, as in Gaul, the Christian faith {{had already had}} adherents for some time prior to 313.|$|R
50|$|In 1000, Athanasius {{compiled}} {{and assigned}} the lectionaries from both <b>Testaments</b> <b>to</b> {{be read in}} the Syriac Orthodox Church. During his tenure as patriarch, Athanasius ordained thirty-nine bishops as well, including maphrian Ignatius I bar Qiqi, before his death at the Monastery of Mar Barsoum in 1002.|$|R
