50|$|<b>Terra</b> <b>fusca</b> (black earth) {{is one of}} the {{two main}} soils of the Mediterranean region, the other being terra rosca (red earth). <b>Terra</b> <b>fusca</b> is found mainly in forested areas and has {{limestone}} as a key ingredient. It is non-acidic as the limestone cancels any acidity.|$|E
50|$|Rizokarpaso {{is one of}} {{the largest}} towns on the peninsula. Soil near the town {{consists}} of <b>terra</b> <b>fusca</b> which is very fertile. Local crops include carob, cotton, tobacco, and grain. The town's surroundings are famous as the wildest and one of the most unspoilt parts of the island. The municipality's territory features the Karpaz National Park, home to the Karpass donkey and some of the finest beaches of the island.|$|E
50|$|West and {{northwest}} of Deidesheim, the Voltziensandstein that predominates {{in the middle}} of the Palatinate Forest from the Triassic represents the oldest stratigraphic unit within Deidesheim’s limits, the so-called “Rehberg Layer”. In Deidesheim’s southwest, Pleistocene deposits can be found; these came into being some 1,500,000 years ago. In the north, Deidesheim is girded by a band of Pliocene deposits that formed some 3,000,000 years ago. In Deidesheim’s east are found the newest stratigraphic units in the Holocene deposits. With foreign material such as basalt, bricks and dung, man has altered the natural soil composition. The most important soil types in the Deidesheim area are various rigosols, rendzina, parabraunerde and limestone-bearing <b>terra</b> <b>fusca.</b>|$|E
50|$|Silver fir is a {{constituent}} of montane central European forests. As a rare species in dry climates of the Mediterranean, the silver firs presence on Mt. Orjen {{is restricted to}} humid northern slopes. A marked difference in the fir's vegetation patterns is seen here. It has a common cause in soil formation. High soil-water content in <b>terrae</b> <b>fuscae</b> on glacial superstratum leads to beech-fir forests. Whereas dry initial rendzinas on glacio-karstic substrate support xeric dinaric calcareaous silver fir forests. Latter endemic community rich in submediterranean species has evolutional parallels with Bosnian Pine communities.|$|R

40|$|Romania. On a slope in the 'Kokel' uplands in Romania (Transylvanian Piedmont at {{the foot}} of the eastern Carpathians) the {{earthworm}} species Proctodrilus tuberculatus (Černosvitov, 1935), P. thaleri Höser & Zicsi, 2009 and P. opisthoductus Zicsi, 1985 were found at different points in the soil catena. The colluvial soil clearly has the distinctive characteristics of an inverse profile. P. tuberculatus occurs at the top of the slope and in the colluvial soil, while P. thaleri was found exclusively in the area {{at the foot}} of the slope towards the valley, in the section of greater colluvial horizon diversity. P. opisthoductus occurs towards the valley floor, in the relatively humus-rich mineral layer of the inverse profile. The pedological findings indicate that P. tuberculatus prefers the leached horizons of the lessived soils. Where P. thaleri occurs is a colluvial soil with a probable tendency to a soil-type interference of lessive soil and brown loam (<b>terra</b> <b>fusca),</b> where these two types are within one and the same soil profile. Possibly the sedimentary lessivage complexes of a <b>terra</b> <b>fusca</b> character (plasma flow) make it easier for the Proctodrilus species to move through the solum...|$|E
40|$|Selected surface Terrae Rossae, or Rhodoxeralfs, and a <b>Terra</b> <b>Fusca</b> (Petrocalcic Palexeralf) {{developed}} on mid-Quaternary calcarenites in the moister region of Rabat show a substantial degree of pedogenic formation of clay minerals, particularly of kaolinites, {{primarily in the}} fraction 2 m, and smectites inherited from the calcarenite-residual loam in the coarse (2 - 0. 2 m) and fine clay fractions (< 0. 2 m). One Terra Rossa shows clear evidence that the soil formation was interrupted twice by deposition of eolian materials, hence it {{is regarded as a}} polycyclic pedocomplex. Eolian input was only of secondary importance during the pedogenesis of the other surface Terrae Rossae. On younger calcarenites (100 ka) near the coast, three Rendzinas, or Typic Calcixerolls, show only slight mineral weathering and pedogenic clay mineral formation, in spite of a varied spectrum of primary minerals. In one example kaolinite formation has just started. Probably the Calcixerolls were recalcified by addition of eolian material either as a result of anthropogenous thinning of the vegetation and/or due to the vicinity of the coast. These results strongly suggest that, at least in this region, Terrae Rossae, or Rhodoxeralfs, were formed during much of the Brunhes epoch in a younger coastal area and over the greatest part of the Brunhes epoch in areas farther from the coast. Because the climatic fluctuation in the cycles of cold and warm periods were generally slight in this region, the direction of soil formation was the same. Therefore we regard the Rhodoxeralfs in the northern p [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Summary The {{current study}} {{presents}} {{a unique and}} intensified interdisciplinary geo-ecological study in the Karst of the Northern Calcareous Alps. This is a study focussing on fundamental research. The investigation area in question focusses on the Reiteralpe in the Berchtesgadener Alps, in which a range of research methods, which in their choice and range have not been used to this extent before, are optimal for further adaptation in silmiliar ecological systems and environments. The {{results of the study}} are elementary and moreover profound to the extent that mappings of outcrops have been identified which however have not been identified before by the scientists involved in researching this area over the past hundred years. It was possible to map outcrops of pleistocene loess deposits, holocene aeolian dust deposits and moreover laterite bauxite outcrops of the Gosau Formation thereby resulting in the production of new soil and diverse outcrop maps as well as presenting a new geological stratigraphy for the Berchtesgadener Alps. A combination of soil mapping techniques in combination with using geo-radar technology made it possible to identify a pleistocene glacial cirque and cirque threshhold at 1800 m NN on a south slope which likewise had not been identified in the past. An extenive soil mapping programme taking microtopographical elements of mountain terrains into consideration were extensively investigated mainly focussing on geology, aspect, slope morphology, vegetational cover and elevation. Loess derived soils and (pre-) tertiary soils and holocene soils have been identified in association with mineralgogical anaysis {{as a result of the}} mappings. Functions relating to soil depth, grain size distribution of soil horizons, clay formation and spatial distribution in a high altitude mountain karst geo system have been undertaken. The intensely enriced aluminium and iron content of the soils associated with the Gosau Formations were mineralogically analysed and the intensively weathered <b>terra</b> <b>fusca</b> soil formations investigated. Precipitation sampling during summer months were analysed respective recent holocene aeolian dust deposits in quantity, quality, spatial distribution, silica grain size distribution and mineralogical composition. The results of which were transferred with a focus on the spatial micro topographical and gemorphological distribution. With this data, a correlation was made to organic horizons of polygentetcial soil formations...|$|E
