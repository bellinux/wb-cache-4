5|$|On November 14, 2015, <b>the</b> <b>candle</b> was lit {{nearly two}} weeks prior to the {{official}} ceremony date after local resident Joe Mercado posted to an Easton, Pennsylvania Facebook community page asking to light <b>the</b> <b>candle</b> to show support {{for the people of}} Paris, France after a terrorist attack the day before. Due to overwhelming response to the post, the city organized a candle light vigil that evening with several hundred residents attending. Prayers were offered in several languages, including French, and several faiths. Easton Mayor Sal Panto Jr. and Allentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski spoke. <b>The</b> <b>candle</b> remained lit for three days before being shut off until the official lighting event.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, a six-foot slab of {{fiberglass}} {{from the}} imitation wax {{at the top}} of <b>the</b> <b>candle</b> was knocked loose by 50 mile-per-hour winds during a storm. Nobody was injured. James Pruznick, a filmmaker from Pohatcong Township, New Jersey, made a documentary film in 2004 focused on that year's assembly of the Peace Candle, as well as interviews with politicians, artists, merchants and construction workers {{about the history of the}} structure. It was first screened in December 2004 and made available subsequently on VHS and DVD. In October 2008, fear grew that the Peace Candle would no longer be erected when Easton employees who previously volunteer to climb the Peace Candle structure no longer wished to assemble it. Those fears were put to rest the next month, however, when the trade union Lehigh Valley Erectors Inc. volunteered to put <b>the</b> <b>candle</b> up.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Easton Mayor Phil Mitman {{dedicated}} that year's lighting to {{the troops}} fighting in Iraq and all of America's veterans. At about 7 p.m., the mayor introduced U.S. Navy veteran Kyle Stocker, whose son 4½-year-old Kayden hit the switch {{to turn on the}} spotlights illuminating <b>the</b> <b>candle.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>candles</b> may {{be joined}} {{together}} by a red ribbon, the color of martyrdom.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>candles</b> {{are placed}} on altars and devotees turn to {{specific}} colored candles depending on their circumstance. Some keep {{the full range of}} colored candle while others focus on one aspect Santa Muerte's spirit. Santa Muerte's image as satanic or evil has been derived from her association with drug trafficking and the dead bodies found at her altar, however, the specific colors for <b>the</b> <b>candles</b> indicate that Santa Muerte's devotees stem from many walks of life beyond crime, violence, and the drug trade. Santa Muerte is called upon for matters of the heart, health, money, wisdom, and justice. There is <b>the</b> brown <b>candle</b> of wisdom, <b>the</b> white <b>candle</b> of gratitude and consecration, <b>the</b> black <b>candle</b> for protection and vengeance, <b>the</b> red <b>candle</b> of love and passion, <b>the</b> gold <b>candle</b> for monetary affairs, <b>the</b> green <b>candle</b> for crime and justice, <b>the</b> purple <b>candle</b> for healing.|$|R
50|$|This final salvo {{is marked}} by the Feast of Our Lady of <b>the</b> <b>Candles</b> in Jaro, Iloilo City, where the image is {{enshrined}} in the Jaro Cathedral, the National Shrine of Our Lady of <b>the</b> <b>Candles,</b> where Tridentine Masses are celebrated in commemoration. Similar celebrations are held nationwide in towns where Our Lady of <b>the</b> <b>Candles</b> is its patroness, including Candelaria, Quezon, whose town fiesta is celebrated on this date.|$|R
5|$|Throughout the late-1970s and the 1980s, the Nazareth-based firm Beatty Contractors erected <b>the</b> <b>candle</b> each year. The firm {{originally}} did {{the project}} for free, but began charging $2,000 in 1981 when the cost of fuel started to rise. During the Peace Candle lighting ceremony on November 28, 1980, Easton Mayor Philip Mitman dedicated <b>the</b> <b>candle</b> to the 52 American hostages being held in Iran during the Iran hostage crisis. During a storm on December 6, 1983, 47 mile-per-hour winds caused the Peace Candle to start tilting in place. When city workers removed the flame next day, they realized the bugler statue atop the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument had moved on its base and would have toppled over {{had it not been}} leaning against <b>the</b> <b>candle</b> structure. One of the candle's anchor cables was also snapped by the wind and torn out of the brickwork. The cable was repaired and the bugler statue, which was previously held by its own weight, was reinforced with grouting. A sixteen-pound chunk of granite was also dislodged {{from the top of the}} statue, although in an area that most spectators cannot see from ground level. <b>The</b> <b>candle</b> suffered similar damage in 1988, when high winds loosened parts of the structure and snapped support wires. As a result, it had to be taken down early on January 5, 1989. In 1985, the Easton Area Christmas Committee was renamed to the Easton Holiday Committee.|$|E
5|$|Hilda Campbell Vaughan (married name Morgan; 12 June 1892 – 4 November 1985) was a Welsh {{novelist and}} short story writer writing in English. Her ten varied novels, set mostly {{in her native}} Radnorshire, concern rural {{communities}} and heroines. Her first was The Battle to the Weak (1925) and her last <b>The</b> <b>Candle</b> and the Light, published in 1954. She was married to the writer Charles Langbridge Morgan, who had an influence on her writings. Although favourably received by her contemporaries, Vaughan subsequently received minimal critical attention. Rediscovery of her work began in the 1980s and 1990s, {{as part of a}} renewed interest in Welsh literature in English.|$|E

Once, when it had forced the Lute, coming close thereto, {{in order to try to}} repair it, I observed that the Spirit which issued out caught Fire at the Flame of <b>the</b> <b>Candle,</b> and continued burning with Violence as it issued out, in a Stream, which 1 blew out, and lighted again, alternately, for several times.|$|E
50|$|One {{was when}} Rufus was told off by Mr Wacks for being late again, in {{which took place}} right after Rufus spoke to Amberley. Rufus was ordered to fill a basket with candles, he did so, but as he put <b>the</b> <b>candles</b> in, he started to {{daydream}} about being a performing clown, juggling <b>the</b> <b>candles</b> that then turned into objects and animals. Rufus was then interrupted by Amberley, in which then caused him to drop and break <b>the</b> <b>candles.</b> Amberley picked up <b>the</b> <b>candles</b> and walked away saying 'Daydreaming again!' The original soundtrack has the juggling music in, right between the musketeer and the beginning music for the Wacks Wicks Works track. One viewer may also find when Rufus was going to cut <b>the</b> <b>candles</b> from <b>the</b> rack, that some broken candles were still seen on the floor from the deleted scene.|$|R
50|$|Both dikirion and trikirion have a flat base, so {{that they}} may stand upright. Above this base is a {{vertical}} shaft terminating in candleholders. The dikirion holds two <b>candles,</b> representing <b>the</b> dual nature of Jesus, and the trikirion holds three, representing the three persons of the Holy Trinity. The candleholders are mounted at an angle so that <b>the</b> <b>candles</b> cross each other. Sometimes in the Russian tradition, <b>the</b> <b>candles</b> are shaped when inserted into their holders so that <b>the</b> separate <b>candles</b> meet and then bend upwards to burn with a single flame. A particularly fancy variation on this has <b>the</b> <b>candles</b> merge in a double and triple spiral. In other traditions, <b>the</b> <b>candles</b> are tied together with ribbons at the point of intersection.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to water, mechanical, and candle clocks, incense clocks {{were used in}} the Far East, and were fashioned in several different forms. Incense clocks were first used in China around the 6th century; in Japan, one still exists in the Shōsōin, although its characters are not Chinese, but Devanagari. Due to their frequent use of Devanagari characters, suggestive of their use in Buddhist ceremonies, Edward H. Schafer speculated that incense clocks were invented in India. Although similar to <b>the</b> <b>candle</b> clock, incense clocks burned evenly and without a flame; therefore, they were more accurate and safer for indoor use.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{said to be the}} largest non-wax Christmas candle in the country. Although {{conceived}} with the hopes of restoring Easton's pre-20th century reputation for elaborate Christmas decorations, city officials also believed a candle would serve as a symbol of peace for all religions and denominations. Due to its symbolism for peace and its placement over a Civil War monument, <b>the</b> <b>candle</b> has been the site of several anti-war protests over the decades. Some have criticized the Peace Candle, calling it a symbol of the over-commercialization of Christmas, and condemning the fact that it covers a war monument.|$|E
5|$|On January 12, 1999, the {{spotlights}} {{surrounding the}} Peace Candle were accidentally turned on, {{and the heat}} from the lights ignited a fire among several of the Christmas trees surrounding the structure. Several residents called police and sprayed the flames with fire extinguishers until city firefighters arrived to put out the blaze. Although flames reached as high as 30 feet, only the trees were damaged and the Peace Candle itself was undamaged. The incident spurred discussion about removing the trees altogether, but Easton officials insisted the fire was just a fluke accident. New spotlights were installed in 2000, which lit <b>the</b> <b>candle</b> from top to bottom and focused on the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Superior Court Judge Jack Panella won a $770 bid on {{the auction}} website eBay to {{flip the switch}} {{and turn on the}} Peace Candle during the candle-lighting {{ceremony}} on November 27, 2009. In November 2010, Easton Holiday Committee Chairwoman Sandy O'Brien-Werner voiced doubts that the current candle structure would last until 2014 as previously projected and might need to be replaced sooner. She expressed concern at the cost of such a venture, claiming the Peace Candle cost $14,640 in 2010 alone for maintenance and operation and that an altogether new structure would cost at least $35,000. In response, six-year-old MaryElizabeth Soffera and eight-year-old Katie Dietrich, two cousins from Williams Township who loved the Peace Candle, opened a snow cone stand during a garage sale to raise money for <b>the</b> <b>candle.</b> They raised $23, which they presented to Mayor Sal Panto Jr. during a November city council meeting.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, however, one of {{the neon}} lights in the flame {{structure}} short-circuited and started a fire on the yellow cotton sack placed over the bugler statue, causing an actual fire on the Christmas Candle flame for a brief amount of time. The blaze caused only minor damage to the Christmas Candle, but the bugler statue was exposed and visible inside the flame {{for the rest of}} the season. Despite this setback, the Christmas Candle was widely considered a success, and the Easton Area Christmas Committee signed a charter on December 17, 1951, tasking itself with organizing a yearly holiday program revolving around the Christmas Candle. <b>The</b> <b>candle</b> was assembled again every Christmas season until 1961, with ceremonies generally including holiday decorations, Christmas carols, refreshments, appearances by Santa Claus and other forms of entertainment. The Easton Area Christmas Committee was responsible for raising the funds and encouraging the civic interest necessary to keep the program active.|$|E
5|$|On {{the table}} are various {{other pieces of}} {{equipment}} that the natural philosopher would have used during his demonstration: a thermometer, candle snuffer and cork, {{and close to the}} man seated to the right is a pair of Magdeburg hemispheres, which would have been used with the air pump to demonstrate the difference in pressure exerted by the air and a vacuum: when the air was pumped out from between the two hemispheres they were impossible to pull apart. The air pump itself is rendered in exquisite detail, a faithful record of the designs in use at the time. What may be a human skull in the large liquid-filled glass bowl would not have been a normal piece of equipment; William Schupbach suggests that it and <b>the</b> <b>candle,</b> which is presumably lighting the bowl from behind, form a vanitas—the two symbols of mortality reflecting the cockatoo's struggle for life.|$|E

50|$|The paschal trikirion is {{fashioned}} {{in various}} styles in various regions. The Greek {{form of the}} paschal trikirion generally has a flat base allowing it to stand upright, and above this base is a vertical shaft terminating in three candleholders; sometimes this base has an icon of the Resurrection. The candleholders may be mounted at an angle so that <b>the</b> <b>candles</b> cross each other, as in a bishop's trikirion. Often <b>the</b> <b>candles</b> are tied together with ribbons {{at the point of}} intersection. Sometimes, among the Greeks, the priest simply holds a large single candle. Another form, more commonly seen in the Slavic churches, has the three candleholders attached to a large blessing crucifix with a vertical handle. This form cannot stand upright while <b>the</b> <b>candles</b> are lit. <b>The</b> <b>candles</b> may be white or each candle may be a different color and fresh flowers often decorate the candleholder.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of slow-release chemical oxidants for sub-surface remediation {{is a relatively}} new technol­ogy. Our objective was to develop slow-release persulfate-paraffin candles to treat BTEX-contaminated ground­water. Laboratory-scale candles were prepared by heating and mixing Na 2 S 2 O 8 with paraffin in a 2. 25 to 1 ra­tio (w/w), and then pouring the heated mixture into circular molds that were 2. 38 cm long and either 0. 71 or 1. 27 cm in diameter. Activator candles were prepared with FeSO 4 or zero-valent iron (ZVI) and wax. By treat­ing benzoic acid and BTEX compounds with slow-release persulfate and ZVI candles, we observed rapid trans­formation of all contaminants. By using 14 C-labeled benzoic acid and benzene, we also confirmed mineraliza­tion (conversion to CO 2) upon exposure to <b>the</b> <b>candles.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>candles</b> aged and were repeatedly exposed to fresh solutions, contaminant transformation rates slowed and removal rates became more linear (zero-order); this change in transformation kinetics mimicked the observed dissolution rates of <b>the</b> <b>candles.</b> By stacking per­sulfate and ZVI candles {{on top of each other}} in a saturated sand tank (14 × 14 × 2. 5 cm) and spatially sampling around <b>the</b> <b>candles</b> with time, <b>the</b> dissolution patterns of <b>the</b> <b>candles</b> and zone of influence were determined. Results showed that as <b>the</b> <b>candles</b> dissolved and persulfate and iron diffused out into the sand matrix, ben­zoic acid or benzene concentrations (Co = 1 mM) decreased by 3 ̆e 90...|$|R
5|$|The new candle was {{designed}} by the Allentown firm Alvin Butz Co., the Allentown firm Barry Isett & Associates, and Bethlehem Steel Corp. Supplies were provided by Dugan & Marcon Inc., Eisenhardt Mills, Ingersoll-Rand Co. and Dectis Painting, and the construction done by the Carpenters Union Local 600, Electricians Union Local 367 and the Northampton County Labor Council. It looked {{almost exactly the same}} as the old previous candle, with eight flood lights installed to illuminate the white shaft. <b>The</b> <b>candle</b> cost $35,000 to build, but Panto said without the help from volunteers, it would have cost around $150,000, not including labor. In order to cover the $15,000 shortfall in funds raised, the city sold Christmas cards, posters, ornaments and $10 Peace Candle ownership shares. The first lighting ceremony for the new candle was held November 23, 1990.|$|E
