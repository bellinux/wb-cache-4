50|$|Laser-drilled micro nozzle air {{bearings}} {{make use}} of computerized manufacturing and design techniques to optimize performance and efficiency. This technology allows manufacturers more flexibility in manufacturing. In turn this allows a larger design envelope in which to optimize their designs for a given application. In many cases engineers can create air bearings that approach the theoretical limit of performance.Rather than a few large nozzles, air bearings with lots of micro nozzles avoid dynamically disadvantageous dead volumes. Dead volumes refer to all cavities in which air cannot be compressed during decrease of the air gap. These appear as weak gas pressure stimulates vibration. Examples of the benefits are: linear drives with accelerations of more than 1,000 m/s² (100 g), or impact drives with even more than 100,000 m/s² (10,000 g) due to high damping in combination with dynamic stiffness; sub-nanometer movements due to lowest noise-induced errors; and seal-free <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> or vacuum for rotary and linear drives via the gap due to guided air supply.|$|E

40|$|Safe {{pipeline}} transportation of energy resources {{is a major}} concern for the public. Since a pipeline has been built and buried, geologic hazards, corrosions and third-party damages all pose cumulative internal and environmental risks to the pipeline’s integrity. As today’s pipeline engineering and operation become more reliant on geospatial data for safety in the pipeline’s life cycle of design, construction, maintenance, and emergency response of pipeline facilities, the rapid and cost-affordable acquisition of terrain data along the pipeline corridor becomes increasingly critical. This paper addresses the use of airborne lidar and imaging technology for pipeline mapping and pipeline safety applications. We aim to improve the safe and secure <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> and liquid energy in pipeline system by assessing the potential benefits of airborne lidar technology. It is concluded that airborne lidar could be an effective technology to assist pipeline risk management to assure safety in design, construction, operation, maintenance, and emergency response of pipeline facilities. Industrial and scientific advances in lidar systems and data processing techniques are opening new technological opportunities to develop an increased capability to accomplish the pipeline mapping and safety applications.

40|$|The use of coal is {{suspected}} {{to have high}} environmental impact. Natural gas is treated as more environmentally friendly with high methane content and lower emission factors. In order to calculate the environmental impact in the whole life cycle associated with combustion of coal and natural gas all stages from “cradle to grave” {{should be taken into}} account. In particular, the transportation stage, {{especially in the case of}} life cycle analysis of gas, seems to be crucial. The distance of <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> from gas fields, for instance located in Siberia, could be mainly associated with high diffuse emission of methane. The comparison of environmental impact assessment of coal and natural gas utilization for heating purposes is presented in the paper. The additional factor taken into account is localisation of boilers. In the analysis the coal is sombusted in combined heat and power plants equipped with flue gas treatment units is that released emissions are relatively remote from an urban area. In contrast, the natural gas is burned in small domestic installations with no additional FGT systems. The results of the analysis are given in 6 major impact categories. Moreover, the results of the life cycle analysis were brought into comprehensive thermo-ecological cost index, which is a cumulated exergy consumption of non-renewable resources.

30|$|By {{producing}} {{gas from}} gaseous region of hydrocarbon reservoirs, some liquids (in {{the form of}} condensed water or condensate) are generated in the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> from reservoir to surface facility systems. A part of these liquids produces in well string. In majority of gas reservoirs, the reservoir pressure is adequate to pump high quantities of gas, which means high velocity in well string. This high velocity can efficiently drain all generated liquid from well string. After decreasing the reservoir pressure below certain value, the production rate of wells falls below an amount that cannot handle the generated liquids in the tubing. The high slip velocity between gas and liquid phases causes some amount of liquid remaining in the well string and increases the static pressure gradient in the well string. By the time, the amount of liquid left behind gas in the well string increases and eventually ceases the flow (see Fig.  3 for a conceptual representation). The pressure drop in the tubing string basically consists of the hydrostatic pressure of the “loaded liquid” plus gas in the string and the frictional pressure loss due to flow. As it is shown in Fig.  4, by decreasing the well flow rate down to a specific rate, the pressure drop across the tubing decreases. After this point, by reducing the flow rate, the pressure drop increases. It is worth mentioning that Fig.  4 shows a typical tubing performance for Marrat well; however, it is primarily applicable for gas condensate wells and also for some oil wells.|$|E

We derive a new method for determining radial diffusion effects and the penetration or <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> molecules and aerosol particles through cylindrical tubes under laminar flow conditions using explicit analytical equations. In {{contrast to the}} traditional Brown method [Brown, R. L. J. Res. Natl. Bur. Stand. (U. S.) 1978, 83, 1 - 8] and CKD method (Cooney, D. O.; Kim, S. S.; Davis, E. J. Chem. Eng. Sci. 1974, 29, 1731 - 1738), the new approximation developed in this study (known as the KPS method) does not require interpolation or numerical techniques. The KPS method agrees well with the CKD method under all experimental conditions and also with the Brown method at low Sherwood numbers. At high Sherwood numbers corresponding to high uptake on the wall, flow entry effects become relevant and are considered in the KPS and CKD methods {{but not in the}} Brown method. The practical applicability of the KPS method is demonstrated by analysis of measurement data from experimental studies of rapid OH, intermediate NO 3, and slow O 3 uptake on various organic substrates. The KPS method also allows determination of the penetration of aerosol particles through a tube, using a single equation to cover both the limiting cases of high and low deposition described by Gormley and Kennedy (Proc. R. Ir. Acad., Sect. A. 1949, 52 A, 163 - 169).

40|$|The use of {{pipelines}} for the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> offers {{not only}} efficiency, {{but a number}} of economic advantages. Nevertheless, pipelines are subject to aggressive operating conditions and environments which can lead to in-service degradation [1] and thus to failures. These failures can have catastrophic consequences, such as environmental damage and loss of life [2]. One of the most dangerous threats to pipeline integrity is stress corrosion cracking (SCC). Despite the substantial progress that has been achieved in the field, due to the complex nature of this phenomenon there is still not a complete understanding of this form of external corrosion. This makes its detection and prevention a challenge and therefore a risk to pipeline integrity, and most importantly, to the safety of the population. ^ SCC cracks are the result of the interaction between a corrosive environment, applied stresses, and a susceptible microstructure. To date, what defines a susceptible microstructure remains ambiguous, as SCC has been observed in a range of steel grades, microstructures, chemical composition, and grain sizes. Therefore, {{in order to be able}} to accurately predict and prevent this hazardous form of corrosion, it is imperative to advance our knowledge on the subject and gain a better understanding on the microstructural features of highly susceptible pipeline materials, especially in the subsurface zone where crack nucleation must take place. Therefore, a microstructural characterization of the region near the surface layer was carried-out utilizing TEM. TEM analysis revealed the dislocation character, ferrite morphology, and apparent carbide precipitation in some grain boundaries. Furthermore, light microscopy, SEM, and hardness testing were performed to expand our knowledge on the microscopical features of highly SCC susceptible service components. This investigation presents a new approach to SCC characterization, which exposed the sub-surface region microscopical characteristics of service components with confirmed SCC. ...|$|E
