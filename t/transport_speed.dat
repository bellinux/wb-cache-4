25|$|Mature axon tracts {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to experience growth when mechanically stretched at the central portion of the axon cylinder. Such mechanical stretch was applied by a custom axon stretch-growth bioreactor composed of four main components: custom-designed axon expansion chamber, linear motion table, stepper motor and controller. The nerve tissue culture is placed within the expansion chamber with a port for gas exchange and a removable stretching frame, which is able to separate two groups of somas (neuron cell bodies) and thus stretch their axons. Collagen gel was used to promote the growth of larger stretch-grown axon tracts that were visible to the unaided eye. There are two reasons for the growth enhancement due to the collagen coating: 1) the culture became hydrophobic after the collagen dried, which permitted a denser concentration of neurons to grow, and 2) the collagen coating created an unobstructed coating across the two elongation substrates. Examination by scanning electron microscope and TEM {{showed no signs of}} axon thinning due to stretch, and the cytoskeleton appeared to be normal and intact. The stretch-grown axon tracts were cultured on a biocompatible membrane, which could be directly formed into a cylindrical structure for transplantation, eliminating the need to transfer axons to a scaffold after growth was complete. The stretch-grown axons were able to grow at an unprecedented rate of 1cm/day after only 8 days of acclimation, which is much greater than the 1mm/day maximal growth rate as measured for growth cone extension. The rate of 1mm/day is also the average <b>transport</b> <b>speed</b> for structural elements such as neurofilaments.|$|E

40|$|History and {{economics}} {{have set the}} stage for the move to grooming at 2. 5 Gbps granularity in the core of optical mesh networks. The evolution of core grooming speeds to the STS- 48 granularity level is a continuation of a cycle that began with the introduction of narrowband cross-connects into the network over 20 years ago. Since then, cross-connect grooming granularity has increased from 64 Kbps, to 1. 5 Mbps, 51. 8 Mbps, and finally to 2. 5 Gbps with the introduction of ultra-broadband cross-connects in 2000. History has shown that switching and grooming <b>speeds</b> increase as <b>transport</b> <b>speeds</b> increase (Figure 1). The primary reasons for scaling grooming <b>speeds</b> with <b>transport</b> <b>speeds</b> are improved network scalability, performance and, most importantly, cost. History has also shown that product designs are specialized- in terms of capacity, scalability, reliability, performance and cost, for particular segments of the network. Network segmentation and specialization is why products designed for the edge do not perform well in the core. Based on the facts stated in this paper, many carriers and industry experts have concluded that an optimal network architecture supports hierarchical <b>transport</b> and grooming <b>speeds,</b> with faster switching (granularity) speeds in the core of the network than at the edge. A hierarchical architecture, with segment specialized products, will persist in the network future just as it has in the past.

50|$|It was {{tempting to}} adopt the readily {{available}} French gun to the anti-tank role.

It was decided to solve the traverse and mobility problems by mounting the 75 mm barrel on the modern split trail carriage of the 5 cm Pak 38 anti-tank gun.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the mechanism of}} egg transport in the newt not only by inserting various conditioned eggs into the recipient's body but also by placing them on the coelomic epithelia of the opened body cavity in the adult female newt. Most of the inserted coelomic eggs were oviposited, while 4 of 14 inserted de-jellied uterine eggs and 3 of 10 inserted de-jellied fertilized eggs were oviposited. The coelomic eggs placed on the coelomic epithelia were transported toward the ostium and entered the ostium. The de-jellied uterine eggs and the de-jellied fertilized eggs were transported to the ostium as well. Of all the eggs examined, the coelomic egg was transported the fastest. The <b>transport</b> <b>speeds</b> of coelomic eggs treated with periodic acid and the speed of boiled coelomic eggs were less than those of untreated coelomic eggs. In contrast, the <b>transport</b> <b>speeds</b> of coelomic eggs treated with trypsin and the speed of coelomic eggs removed from their vitelline envelopes (naked eggs) were faster than those of untreated coelomic eggs.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mucociliary {{clearance}} in the airways {{is driven}} by the coordinated beating of ciliated cells. Classical neuromediators such as noradrenalin and acetylcholine increase ciliary beat frequency and thus cilia-driven transport. Despite the fact that the neuromediator serotonin is ciliostimulatory in invertebrates and has been implied in releasing acetylcholine from the airway epithelium, its role in regulating cilia function in vertebrate airways is not established. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined the effects of serotonin on ciliary beat frequency and cilia-driven particle transport in the acutely excised submerged mouse trachea and determined the sources of serotonin in this tissue by immunohistochemistry. Serotonin (100 microM) increased cilary beat frequency (8. 9 +/- 1. 2 Hz to 17. 0 +/- 2. 7 Hz) and particle <b>transport</b> <b>speed</b> (38. 9 +/- 4. 6 microm/s to 83. 4 +/- 8. 3 microm/s) to an extent that was comparable to a supramaximal dose of ATP. The increase in particle <b>transport</b> <b>speed</b> was totally prevented by methysergide (100 microM). Blockade of muscarinic receptors by atropine (1 microM) did not reduce the effect of serotonin, although it was effective in preventing the increase in particle <b>transport</b> <b>speed</b> mediated by muscarine (100 microM). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated serotonin in mast cells pointing towards mast cells and platelets as possible endogenous sources of serotonin. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that serotonin is a likely endogenous mediator that can increase cilia-driven transport independent from acetylcholine during activation of mast cells and platelets...|$|E
