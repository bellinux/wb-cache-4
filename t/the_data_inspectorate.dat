Seventy-nine patients met the inclusion criteria. However, 13 patients were not included because of the following reasons: seven patients had died during the follow-up time, five patients did not respond to the enquiry, and one patient did not want to participate in the study. Thus, 66 patients (76 hips) were included, representing a 92 % follow-up. Twenty-four patients (36 %) were female and 42 patients were male. They had been treated between 1953 and 1986. The mean age at primary surgery was 13.2  years, 12.5  years (range 10.7 – 14.5  years) among the female patients and 13.6  years (range 8.8 – 16.7  years) among the male patients.|$|E

40|$|SAMMENDRAG Det er usikkerhet om eksponering for stoffer fra tannfyllingsmaterialer kan påvirke kvinners fertilitet. Vi har undersøkt forekomst av og risiko for spontanabort i første svangerskap blant praktiserende tannleger og sammenlignet resultatene med yrkesaktive lektorer/adjunkter og hjemmeværende kvinner. Et spørreskjema som omfattet en reproduktiv og en yrkesrelatert historie, ble sendt til alle kvinnelige medlemmer av Den norske tannlegeforening og et tilfeldig trukket utvalg av kvinnelige medlemmer i Norsk undervisningsforbund. Ved at ikke alle kvinnene var yrkesaktive i tiden før de ble gravide, kunne studiepopulasjonen deles i praktiserende tannleger (n= 727), yrkesaktive lektorer/adjunkter (n= 340) og hjemmeværende (n= 300). For studiepopulasjonen samlet spontanaborterte ca. ni prosent av alle kvinner i første svangerskap, og over tiårsintervallene fra 1951 til 1990 økte spontanabortfrekvensen fra 5, 3 % til 11, 5 %. Det var en signifikant sammenheng mellom graviditetsutfall og tid til graviditet. Kvinner som hadde brukt ni måneder eller mer på å bli gravide, spontanaborterte to ganger hyppigere enn dem som brukte kortere tid. Risikoen for spontanabort blant praktiserende tannleger totalt var den samme som for hjemmeværende og for undervisningspersonell. I aldersgruppen over 30 år hadde tannlegene imidlertid 2, 4 ganger høyere {{odds ratio}} (95 % konfidensintervall: 1. 0 – 5. 4) enn undervisningspersonell. Antatt eksponering for kvikksølv fra innlegging av amalgamfyllinger, for bensenholdig desinfeksjonssprit og for andre løsemidler økte ikke risikoen. Dahl JE, Sundby J.   Risk for {{spontaneous}} abortion among primiparous dental surgeons in Norway. Nor J Epidemiol   Occupational exposure to potentially hazardous agents {{may increase the}} risk of spontaneous abortion. The present study addresses the frequency and risk for miscarriage among dental surgeons compared to those of high-school teachers and non-employed women. A self-administered postal questionnaire was mailed to all dental surgeons registered in the Norwegian Dental Association (n= 1320), and to a random sample of high schools teachers (n= 1084), recruited from the registry in the Norwegian Educational Association. The data were collected retrospectively comprising the reproductive and occupational history of the female. The occupational exposure was addressed by a thorough examination of the work performed in the time when the couple tried to conceive and the woman became pregnant for her first time. The use of mercury containing dental amalgam, chloroform based root canal sealer, ethanol based disinfectant containing benzene, and other organic solvents was addressed in detail. Nitrous oxide sedation had not been used in dental surgeries in Norway when the survey was undertaken. The study was approved by the National Committee for Research Ethics and <b>the</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Inspectorate</b> in Norway. As not all women were working at the time when they became pregnant, the study population was subdivided into dental surgeons (n= 727), high-school teachers (n= 340) and group of homemaking women (n= 300). On the average, 9. 2 % of the primiparous women had a spontaneous abortion. In the time period 1951 - 1990, the incidence of miscarriage increased from 5. 3 % to 11. 5 % for the study population. There was a significant correlation between outcome of pregnancy and time to pregnancy. Spontaneous abortion occurred twice as often in women who had a waiting time to pregnancy of nine months or more compared to women having shorter waiting time. The risk for spontaneous abortion among practising dentists in total was the same as for homemakers and teachers. In the age group past 30 years the dentists had a 2. 4 times higher odds ratio (95 % confidence interval: 1. 0 – 5. 4) than teachers but {{it was not possible to}} link this to a specific occupational exposure. Exposure to mercury from the use of dental amalgam, to ethanol based disinfectant containing 0. 25 % benzene or to other solvents did not increase the risk.

40|$|Professor Finn Wisløff (et. al) at Ullevål Universitetssykehus {{started in}} 1984 a {{comprehensive}} study on multiple myeloma {{in a particular}} health region in Norway (Myelomatoseprosjektet i helseregion I). All patients with a newly discovered M-component were registered during the period 1984 - 1986 and the patients with multiple myeloma were followed up until 1990. The aims {{of this study were}} to find the incidence of multiple myeloma, risk factors for multiple myeloma and the figures on asymptomatic multiple myeloma. Another goal related to this study was to carry out a long term follow up of the patients with a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Today, about 20 years after Wisløff (et. al) started their study, {{the time has come to}} accomplish this work. Thus, the main goals of our study has been to elucidate: -	whether patients with MGUS have greater risk of developing multiple myeloma or another malignant lymphoproliferative disease than the normal population -	how many years such a malignant progression of MGUS, if any, has taken -	if any of the registered parameters (blood values etc.) when MGUS were diagnosed, could be a predictor of malignant progression. Applications to The Directorate for Health and Social Affairs and <b>the</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Inspectorate</b> were sent autumn 2004 to get the necessary ethical permissions related to our study. 151 patients from Wisløffs (et. al) study were identified with MGUS and 40 of these were alive. Taken account for the patients that did not give a written permission to be included in the study and patient records not obtainable, a total number of 134 patients were included in the study. During the period from September 2004 to August 2005 a number of hospitals in the South East region of Norway were visited to obtain the necessary patient information. Among the 134 patients with MGUS, 61 (45, 5 %) were men and 73 (54, 5 %) were women. The median age when MGUS was diagnosed was 71, 5 years. 17 patients (12, 7 %) had developed a malignant lymphoproliferative disease as follows: 11 (64, 7 %) – Multiple Myeloma 2 (11, 7 %) – Lymphoma 1 (5, 8 %) - Malignant Lymphoid Disease, unspecified 1 (5, 8 %) – Waldenströms Macroglobulinaemia 1 (5, 8 %) – Plasmacytoma 1 (5, 8 %) - Hairy Cell Leukaemia These figures are relatively low in comparision with other related studies carried out in other countries. It is assumed that such discrepancy is due to slightly different definitions of multiple myeloma in different countries, and that the material in our study also has included patients with very small monoclonal components. Among the patients with a malignant progression, 12 (70, 6 %) were women and 5 (29, 3 %) were men. The median age when the malignant disease was diagnosed was 73, 5 years. Of the 17 patients who developped a malignant lymphoproliferative disease, 44 % had such a progression after 5 years, 9, 7 % after 10 years and 100 % after 18 years. The cumulative risk of developing a malignant plasma cell disease for the whole patient group (134) was 5, 2 % after 5 years, 9, 7 % after 10 years and 12 % after 18 years. The results of a Cox regression model using four continuous variables (age, concentraion of M-component, creatinine, Ca,) established at initial diagnoses of MGUS, showed that none of these factors are significant predictors for a malign progression of MGUS. On the basis of our data and figures on incidence of multiple myeloma and related disorders in the general population, it is demonstrated that patients with MGUS have a greater risk of developing a malignant plasma cell or lymphoproliferative disease than healthy subjects. Other related international studies have a similar conclusion...|$|E

The reason for the rules was that the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association did not want the records from the CVR to be used in criminal cases against pilots.

The analysis revealed three connections between doctorpatient communication and patients’ treatment decisions: a) negative communication experiences because of the use of CAM; b) negative communication experiences resulted in the decision to use CAM, and in some cases to decline CT; and c) positive 2 communication experiences led to the decision to use CAM as supplement, not alternative to CT. The patients, including the decliners of CT, wanted to discuss treatment decisions in well-functioning interpersonal processes with supportive doctors. In doctors’ practices and education of doctors, a greater awareness of potential positive and negative outcomes of doctor-patient communication that concern CAM issues could be of importance.

40|$|Both {{diabetes}} and depression are enormous health problems. Several chronic illnesses are co-morbid with depression, and diabetes {{is not an}} exception. Scientists and epidemiologists have long been conducting research {{on the relationship between}} {{diabetes and}} depression. Several epidemiological studies confirm this relationship. Aim: The aim of this project was to investigate this relationship between concurrent use of antidepressants and antidiabetic in users of different numbers of antidepressants and different regimens of diabetes treatment. Methodology: The study is a cross-sectional design; Data on prescribed and dispensed medication from 2006 obtained from all pharmacies across Norway, supplied by the Norwegian Prescription database are the source of material in this study. The database was pseudonymized upon reception. Therefore, data cannot integrally be traced back to any individual. There was therefore no need to involve the Regional or Local Committee for Medical Research Ethics nor <b>the</b> Norwegian <b>Data</b> <b>Inspectorate</b> since <b>the</b> database is properly secured. However, permission to use <b>the</b> <b>data</b> was obligatory. Individuals between 20 and 79 years of age are the subjects selected from the database and categorized into users of insulin only, those who received oral anti-glycaemia agents only and those who received both insulin and oral anti-glycaemia agents. Individuals were further categorized according to; whether received single type, multiple types or no antidepressants. Odds ratio was then calculated and adjusted for age and gender using binary logistic regression. Results: The odds ratio of using single antidepressants were 1. 5 times higher among individuals who received insulin only and individuals who received oral anti glycaemic only compared to the general population (OR = 1. 55, 95 % CI: 1. 49 - 1. 62 and OR= 1. 56, 95 % CI: 1. 52 - 1. 60 respectively). Individuals who received both insulin and oral anti glycaemic agents had twice the risk of using single antidepressants compared to the general population; (OR= 2. 0, 95 % CI: 1. 90 - 2. 11). In the usage of multiple antidepressants, users of insulin only had also 1. 5 times the risk compared to the general population (OR= 1. 52, 95 % CI: 1. 38 - 1. 66). Users of oral anti glycaemic agents only had 1. 8 times the risk compared to the general population (OR= 1. 84. 95 % CI: 1. 74 - 1. 94). The risk was significantly higher than the risk of single antidepressants usage and shows that multiple antidepressants usage is more common among these individuals compared to the general population. The risk was also higher among individuals who received both insulin and oral glycaemic agents (OR= 2. 25, 95 % CI: 2. 04 - 2. 50) compared to the general population. Within age groups; among users of insulin only, individuals of age group 50 - 59 had the highest risk (OR= 1. 78, 95 % CI: 1. 62 - 1. 95) of using single antidepressants compared to the general population. Among users of oral anti glycaemic only, age groups 30 - 59 had the highest risk (1. 8 - 2. 4 times) compared to the general population. The odds ratio for individuals who received both insulin and oral anti glycaemic agents was also higher among age groups 20 - 59 (2 - 4. 5 times) compared to the general population. The risk for individuals who received both insulin and oral anti glycaemic agents was higher than the risks for users of insulin only and users of oral anti glycaemic agents only. The risk of using multiple antidepressant among users of insulin only was higher (2 times) among age groups 20 ‐ 39 compared to the general population. Among individuals of oral anti glycaemic only, age groups 20 ‐ 59 had higher significant risks (2 ‐ 3 times) in using multiple antidepressants compared to the general population. Whiles among users of both insulin and oral anti glycaemic agents, individuals of age groups 30 ‐ 59 had the highest risk (3 ‐ 4. 5 times) compared to the general population. Regarding gender, the risk of using multiple antidepressants was higher than the risk in using single antidepressants. Although the prevalence is higher in women than men, there is a negligible difference in the risk of using antidepressants among men than women. Conclusion: The usage of single antidepressants was higher than multiple antidepressants among diabetes individuals as it was for the general population. For individuals using oral antidiabetic agents only, the risk of using multiple antidepressants versus single antidepressants was higher than for the general population. The reason for this needs further study. Although, there are limitations of cross‐sectional studies and secondly, there was no means to adjust for factors as BMI, CHD, smoking and physical activities, the result confirms previous studies suggesting an association between diabetes and depression...|$|R
