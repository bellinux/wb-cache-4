40|$|In an {{unconditionally secure}} Distributed Oblivious Transfer (DOT) protocol, a {{receiver}} contacts at least k servers to obtain one of <b>the</b> n <b>secrets</b> {{held by a}} sender.

In practical applications, the probability distribution of <b>the</b> <b>secrets</b> may not be uniform, e. g., when DOT protocols are used in auctions, some bids may be more probable than others. In this kind of scenario, we show that the claim "a party cannot obtain more than a linear combination of secrets" is incorrect; depending on the probability distribution of <b>the</b> <b>secrets,</b> some existing polynomial interpolation-based DOT protocols allow a cheating receiver, or a curious server, who has obtained a linear combination of <b>the</b> <b>secrets</b> to determine all <b>the</b> <b>secrets...</b>|$|R
