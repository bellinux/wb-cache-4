5|$|After Jonathan Martin's arson {{attack on}} York Minster in 1829 caused major damage, there were {{proposals}} by the dean and chapter {{to take the}} opportunity of the destruction <b>to</b> <b>restructure</b> {{the interior of the}} building. Etty was prominent in the effort to resist the redesign and to restore the building to its original state. A campaign led by Etty and other York luminaries was successful, and the plans were eventually defeated in February 1831.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE:To {{examine the}} {{influence}} of enterprise restructuring on general health and emotional exhaustion, and to investigate which factors explain the relation between restructuring and these outcomes. METHODS:Longitudinal data of the Netherlands Working Conditions Cohort Study were used. At baseline and after 12 months, 9076 employees filled out a questionnaire. Logistic regression analysis was applied. RESULTS:Prolonged exposure <b>to</b> <b>restructuring</b> increased the likelihood of poor general health, and its influence was partly explained by job insecurity. Emotional exhaustion was more likely among employees that experienced prolonged exposure <b>to</b> <b>restructuring</b> or restructuring during the past year. Job insecurity explained {{the influence of}} prolonged restructuring, together with job demands and supervisor's support. CONCLUSIONS:Prolonged exposure <b>to</b> <b>restructuring</b> adversely affects general health and emotional exhaustion in employees, and its influence seems to be explained by job insecurity...|$|R

5|$|After the {{unexpected}} loss of Armendáriz, production proceeded, experiencing complications from uncredited rewrites by Berkely Mather during filming. Editor Peter Hunt set about editing the film while key elements were {{still to be}} filmed, helping <b>to</b> <b>restructure</b> the opening scenes. Hunt and Young conceived of moving the Red Grant training sequence {{to the beginning of}} the film (prior to the main title), a signature feature that has been an enduring hallmark of every Bond film since. The briefing with Blofeld was rewritten, and back projection was used to re-film Lotte Lenya's lines.|$|E
5|$|Bonfire was {{postponed}} until 2002 <b>to</b> <b>restructure</b> {{it to make}} it safer. Delays {{in the development of}} a safety plan and a high estimated cost (mainly due to liability insurance), led A president Ray Bowen to postpone Bonfire indefinitely. Despite the university's refusal to allow Bonfire to take place on campus, since 2002 a non-university sanctioned Bonfire has burned annually. Known as Student Bonfire, the off-campus event draws between 8,000 and 15,000 fans.|$|E

Despite the company's financial difficulties, in 2015, Buffon, who had by then acquired 56% of the company's shares, had reportedly invested €20million in order to save the company from bankruptcy. In late December, Zucchi was acquired by a French investment fund, Astrance Capital, which took control of Buffon's company GB Holding, under an agreement <b>to</b> <b>restructure</b> Zucchi Group's debt, while Buffon was allowed to retain a 15% share in the company.|$|E
5|$|After {{the third}} volume, a new editor was {{assigned}} to the series. Kamiya noted the third volume contained a lot of plot progression, and was going to balance it out in the fourth volume with more lighthearted and carefree events.. Volumes four and five were written as a single volume; since volume four lacked a climatic ending, Kamiya had <b>to</b> <b>restructure</b> the story. This, along with communication problems with his new editor, and other problems in Kamiya's life caused a month delay in volume four's release. After completing volume five, Kamiya was asked to submit volume six's manuscript before 2014 for the anime adaptation, and to complete the volume before the anime's premiere.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, facing {{financial}} collapse, Bain & Company asked Romney to return. Announced as its new CEO in January 1991, he drew {{a symbolic}} salary of one dollar (remaining managing general partner of Bain Capital during this time). He oversaw an effort <b>to</b> <b>restructure</b> Bain & Company's employee stock-ownership plan and real-estate deals, while rallying the firm's one thousand employees, imposing a new governing structure that excluded Bain and the other founding partners from control, and increasing fiscal transparency. He got Bain and other initial owners who had removed excessive amounts of money from the firm to return substantial amounts, and persuaded creditors, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to accept less than full payment. Within about a year, he had led Bain & Company to a return to profitability. He turned Bain & Company over to new leadership and returned to Bain Capital in December 1992.|$|E

Brown succeeds Blair as Labour Party leader and Prime Minister in 2007. But while Blair praises Brown as a good Chancellor and a committed public servant, he believes his decision to abandon the New Labour policies of the Blair years leads to the party's 2010 election defeat.

5|$|In 2009, the CRS {{proposed}} four options: Option 1 was {{to continue}} the VH-71 program with Increment I and II versions; the additional cost was estimated at $10billion and the entry into service date was 2019. Option 2 was <b>to</b> <b>restructure</b> the program to provide 23 Increment I aircraft; at an additional cost of $6.4billion and would be operational by 2012. Option 3 was a restructure to provide 19 Increment I aircraft to replace the current fleet; the additional cost for this option was estimated at $5.6billion and the entry into service by 2012. The last option was to upgrade and extend life of current fleet {{at a cost of}} $1.4billion; however this would not meet the standards required for future presidential helicopters, and would require replacement sooner.|$|E

5|$|In July–August 1946, Eastern Area Command {{oversaw the}} {{establishment}} of No.86 (Transport) Wing, operating C-47 Dakotas, at RAAF Station Schofields, New South Wales, displacing No.78 (Fighter) Wing, which moved to RAAF Station Williamtown, and began operating P-51 Mustangs. The following month, Air Vice Marshal Jones proposed reducing the five mainland area commands (North-Western, North-Eastern, Eastern, Southern, and Western Areas) to three: Northern Area, covering Queensland and the Northern Territory; Eastern Area, covering New South Wales; and Southern Area, covering Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. The proposal {{was part of a}} much larger plan <b>to</b> <b>restructure</b> the post-war RAAF; the Federal government rejected the plan and the wartime area command boundaries largely remained in place. Lachal succeeded Charlesworth as AOC Eastern Area in October, and held command until his retirement from the Air Force in July 1947.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev also {{proposed}} <b>to</b> <b>restructure</b> Soviet high schools. While {{the high schools}} provided a college preparatory curriculum, in fact few Soviet youths went on to university. Khrushchev wanted to shift the focus of secondary schools to vocational training: students would {{spend much of their}} time at factory jobs or in apprenticeships and only a small part at the schools. In practice, what occurred is that schools developed links with nearby enterprises, and students went to work for only one or two days a week; the factories and other works disliked having to teach, while students and their families complained that they had little choice in what trade to learn.|$|E
5|$|Sega {{was one of}} {{the primary}} {{competitors}} to Nintendo in the video game console industry. A few of Sega's early consoles outsold their competitors in specific markets, such as the Master System in Europe. Several of the company's later consoles were commercial failures, however, and the financial losses incurred from the Dreamcast console caused the company <b>to</b> <b>restructure</b> itself in 2001. As a result, Sega ceased to manufacture consoles and became a third-party video game developer. The only console that Sega has produced since is the educational toy console Advanced Pico Beena in 2005. Third-party variants of Sega consoles have been produced by licensed manufacturers, even after production of the original consoles had ended. Many of these variants have been produced in Brazil, where versions of the Master System and Genesis are still sold and games for them are still developed.|$|E

5|$|The 1888 World Fair {{was one of}} the era's {{major events}} in Barcelona and {{represented}} a key point {{in the history of the}} Modernisme movement. Leading architects displayed their best works, including Gaudí, who showcased the building he had designed for the Compañía Trasatlántica (Transatlantic Company). Consequently he received a commission <b>to</b> <b>restructure</b> the Saló de Cent of the Barcelona City Council, but this project was ultimately not carried out. In the early 1890s Gaudí received two commissions from outside of Catalonia, namely the Episcopal Palace, Astorga, and the Casa Botines in León. These works contributed to Gaudí's growing renown across Spain. In 1891, he travelled to Málaga and Tangiers to examine the site for a project for the Franciscan Catholic Missions that the 2nd marquis of Comillas had requested him to design.|$|E

5|$|Nablus {{came under}} the rule of the Ottoman Empire in 1517, along with the whole of Palestine. The Ottomans divided Palestine into six sanjaqs ("districts"): Safad, Jenin, Jerusalem, Gaza, Ajlun and Nablus, all of which were part of Ottoman Syria. These five sanjaqs were subdistricts of the Vilayet of Damascus. Sanjaq Nablus was further {{subdivided}} into five nahiya (subdistricts), in addition to the city itself. The Ottomans did not attempt <b>to</b> <b>restructure</b> the political configuration of the region on the local level such that the borders of the nahiya were drawn to coincide with the historic strongholds of certain families. Nablus was only one among a number of local centers of power within Jabal Nablus, and its relations with the surrounding villages, such as Beita and Aqraba, were partially mediated by the rural-based chiefs of the nahiya. During the 16th century, the population was predominantly Muslim, with Jewish, Samaritan and Christian minorities.|$|E
