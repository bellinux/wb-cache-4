5|$|According to the Augustan History, Odaenathus {{was assassinated}} by a cousin named Maeonius. In Augustan History, Odaenathus' son {{from his first}} wife was named Herodes and was crowned co-ruler by his father. The Augustan History claims that Zenobia conspired with Maeonius for a time {{because she did not}} accept her stepson as his father's heir (ahead of her own children). The Augustan History does not suggest that Zenobia was {{involved}} in the events leading to her husband's murder, and <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>is</b> attributed to Maeonius' moral degeneration and jealousy. This account, according to historian Alaric Watson, can be dismissed as fictional. Although some modern scholarship suggests that Zenobia was involved in the assassination due to political ambition and opposition to her husband's pro-Roman policy, she continued Odaenathus' policies during her first years on the throne.|$|E

25|$|The {{hypothesis}} of innocence is only rejected when an error is very unlikely, because one doesn't want to convict an innocent defendant. Such an error is called error {{of the first}} kind (i.e., the conviction of an innocent person), and the occurrence of this error is controlled to be rare. As a consequence of this asymmetric behaviour, an error of the second kind (acquitting a person who committed <b>the</b> <b>crime),</b> <b>is</b> more common.|$|E

After the serpent is cursed by Yahweh, the woman receives a penalty that impacts two primary roles: childbearing and her subservient relationship to her husband. Adam's penalty thus follows. The reaction of Adam, the naming of Eve, and Yahweh making skin garments are described in a concise narrative (3:20-21). The garden account ends with an intradivine monologue, determining the couple's expulsion, and the execution of that deliberation (3:22–24).|$|E
25|$|Many forces also operate unmarked cars, {{in any of}} {{the roles}} shown above, but most {{frequently}} for the use of traffic enforcement or detectives. They have the advantage of not being immediately recognizable, and are a valuable tool in catching criminals while <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>is</b> still taking place. In the United States, unmarked cars are also used by federal law enforcement agencies such as the FBI and the Secret Service, but can be recognized by their U.S. government plates. However, not all unmarked police cars have government license plates. Many U.S. jurisdictions use regular civilian issued license plates on unmarked cars, especially gang suppression and vice prevention units. Also see Q-car.|$|E

25|$|Illegal {{prostitution}} is {{the most}} common form of prostitution in Nevada; <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>is</b> a misdemeanor. The cities of Las Vegas and Reno have worked to expand their tourism base by attracting families to the hotels and casinos. Accordingly, the state legislature has made prostitution illegal in Clark County, and law enforcement agencies have tried to eliminate the once-rampant street prostitution, enacting legislation against it in 1971. Nevertheless, prostitutes continue to work in casinos, where they wait in bars and attempt to make contact with potential clients. Of all the prostitution business in Nevada, only about 10% is legal, and 90% occurs in Las Vegas. Legal prostitution in Nevada grosses about $75million per year while illegal prostitution in the Las Vegas area grosses about $5billion per year. Some 300–400 prostitutes are arrested each month by the Las Vegas police.|$|E
25|$|This has {{advantages}} {{both for}} bank robbers and for law enforcement. In urban areas the transportation infrastructure is more highly developed, especially where banks tend to cluster near retail shopping areas and commercial districts. Such banks are highly profitable targets for robbers, who are then afforded {{a number of}} potential escape routes. Law enforcement benefit {{by being able to}} respond more quickly, and the odds of catching a bank robber on or near the scene is higher than other types of crime. This is because most bank robberies are reported very quickly while <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>is</b> in progress; most bank robberies occur during daylight hours, have multiple witnesses and with modern technology often produce photographic images that can be distributed and used immediately to canvass the local area. Consequently, many bank robbers are caught the same day. The clearance rate for bank robbery is among the highest of all crimes, at nearly 60%.|$|E
25|$|Book Nine {{introduces}} {{the details of}} Fyodor's murder and describes the interrogation of Dmitri as he is questioned for the crime he maintains he did not commit. The alleged motive for <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>is</b> robbery. Dmitri was {{known to have been}} completely destitute earlier that evening, but is suddenly seen on the street with thousands of rubles shortly after his father's murder. Meanwhile, the three thousand rubles that Fyodor Karamazov had set aside for Grushenka has disappeared. Dmitri explains that the money he spent that evening came from three thousand rubles Katerina gave him to send to her sister. He spent half that at his first meeting with Grushenka—another drunken orgy—and sewed up the rest in a cloth, intending to give it back to Katerina in the name of honor, he says. The lawyers are not convinced by this. All of the evidence points against Dmitri; the only other person in the house {{at the time of the}} murder was Smerdyakov, who was incapacitated due to an epileptic seizure he apparently suffered the day before. As a result of the overwhelming evidence against him, Dmitri is formally charged with the patricide and taken away to prison to await trial.|$|E

In 1821, Sharp had been accused in Bowling Green, Kentucky by Anna Cooke of fathering her illegitimate child; it was stillborn. Sharp denied paternity, and public opinion favored him. In 1824, Beauchamp married Cooke, who was sixteen years older than he. She asked him to kill Sharp to defend her honor.|$|E

His financial situation was very likely desperate, as extortionists and other criminals who steal large amounts of money nearly always do so, according to experts, because they need it urgently; otherwise, <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>is</b> not worth the considerable risk.

Writing for Sabotage Times, Gareth Dimelow concluded it leaves the viewer to ponder: [...] "If someone has no recollection of their crimes, can they be effectively punished?
