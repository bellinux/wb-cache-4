5|$|A {{squadron}} {{commanded by}} Admiral Pierre Vanstabel was dispatched to Hampton Roads to provide escort. Vanstabel {{would bring the}} convoy <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> of Biscay, where a second squadron under Joseph-Marie Nielly would reinforce him {{for the rest of}} the journey. Together, these officers mustered six ships of the line and numerous smaller craft. The main French battlefleet of 25 ships under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse would cruise the Bay of Biscay in order to challenge the British Channel Fleet if it attempted to intercept the supplies. The convoy's passage was expected to take approximately two months, and it included 117 merchant ships carrying enough food to feed France for a year.|$|E
5|$|After the scuttling of the monitors, around 450 {{officers}} and {{men from the}} Sava and various other riverine vessels gathered at Obrenovac.

5|$|Aquatic mammals {{are also}} present in the bay. Before 1825, Spanish, French, English, Russians and Americans were drawn <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> Area to harvest prodigious {{quantities}} of beaver, river otter, marten, fisher, mink, fox, weasel, harbor and fur seals and sea otter. This early fur trade, known as the California Fur Rush, was {{more than any other}} single factor, responsible for opening up the West and the San Francisco Bay Area, in particular, to world trade. By 1817 sea otter in the area were practically eliminated. Since then, the California golden beaver has re-established a presence in the Alhambra Creek. The North American river otter which was first reported in Redwood Creek at Muir Beach in 1996, has since been spotted in the North Bay's Corte Madera Creek, the South Bay's Coyote Creek, as well as in 2010 in San Francisco Bay itself at the Richmond Marina. Other mammals include the internationally famous sea lions who began inhabiting San Francisco's Pier 39 after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and the locally famous Humphrey the Whale, a humpback whale who entered San Francisco Bay twice on errant migrations in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises have recently returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bay,</b> having been absent for many decades. Historically, this was the northern extent of their warm-water species range.|$|E
5|$|Armed {{conflict}} in Croatia continued intermittently {{on a smaller}} scale. There were several smaller operations undertaken by Croatian forces to relieve the siege of Dubrovnik, and other Croatian cities (Šibenik, Zadar and Gospić) from Krajina forces. Battles included the Miljevci plateau incident (between Krka and Drniš), on June 21–22, 1992, Operation Jaguar at Križ Hill near Bibinje and Zadar, on May 22, 1992, {{and a series of}} military actions in the Dubrovnik hinterland: Operation Tigar, on 1–13 July 1992, in Konavle, on 20–24 September 1992, and at Vlaštica on September 22–25, 1992. Combat near Dubrovnik was followed by the withdrawal of JNA from Konavle, between September 30 and October 20, 1992. The Prevlaka peninsula guarding entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> of Kotor was demilitarized and turned over to the UNPROFOR, while the remainder of Konavle was restored to the Croatian authorities.|$|E

40|$|High stream nitrate was {{observed}} in all Coastal Bays segments. Stream nitrate is a relative measure of nutrients entering the system. High levels indicate excess inputs from human activities. These inputs are transported <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bays</b> via surface runoff and groundwater. Streams and small creeks are often the initial receptors of pollutants, which then travel downstream <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bays.</b> Most streams in <b>the</b> Coastal <b>Bays</b> watershed were degraded with excess nitrogen. A majority of streams failed the nitrate threshold suggesting human inputs are high. Streams with more intensive monitoring programs appeared to have more sporadic stormwater inputs and, overall, had higher concentrations of stream nitrate. Many tributaries, even in the relatively undeveloped Chincoteague Bay watershed, had stream nitrate values indicative of enrichment from human activities...|$|R
5|$|At 08:30 on {{the morning}} of 18 December, a small boat sailed from Anse la Barque with a message {{offering}} the British a temporary truce. Simultaneously the British ship of the line HMS Sceptre arrived from Fort Royal on Martinique under the command of Captain Samuel James Ballard, who immediately assumed command of the diverse squadron assembled at the entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bay.</b> Ballard dismissed the French negotiators and ordered an immediate attack on the anchored frigates. His plan was simple: Blonde and Thetis would enter the harbour and engage the flûtes directly, while Sceptre and Freija would engage the gun batteries to prevent them targeting the small brigs bringing up the rear. The brigs would be towing boats full of sailors and Royal Marines, who would storm the French ships and gun positions as they were engaged with the larger warships.|$|E
5|$|Current glaciers cover an area 1,375 {{square miles}} (3,560km2) and {{accounts}} for 27% of the Park area. Up {{until the early}} 1700s the area was a large single glacier of solid ice. It has since retreated and evolved into the largest protected water area park in the world. Glacier Bay, on the Gulf of Alaska, {{was known as the}} Grand Pacific Glacier, about 4,000 feet (1,200 m) thick and around 20 miles (32km) in width. Over the last 200 years the glaciers have retreated, exposing 65 miles (105km) of ocean, and in this process left 20 separate other glaciers in its trail. In 1890, the name “Glacier Bay” as such was given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> by Captain Lester A. Beardslee of the U.S. Navy. It was first proclaimed a U.S. National Monument on February 25, 1925, by President Calvin Coolidge.|$|E
5|$|In 1797 the Republic of Venice was {{abolished}} {{after the}} French conquest. The Venetian territory was then {{handed over to}} the Archduchy of Austria. The territory was returned to France after the Peace of Pressburg in 1805. However, the former Venetian possessions on the eastern Adriatic shore, including the present-day Croatian Littoral, were joined into a set of separate provinces of the French Empire: the Illyrian Provinces, created in 1809 through the Treaty of Schönbrunn. Days before the Battle of Waterloo, the Congress of Vienna awarded the Illyrian Provinces (spanning from the Gulf of Trieste <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> of Kotor) to the Austrian Empire.|$|E
