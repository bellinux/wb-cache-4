5|$|All A3 Pacifics were {{subsequently}} {{fitted with a}} double Kylchap chimney to improve performance and economy.

5|$|Once, {{while working}} at the Sanitarium, Beilhart was called to the bedside {{of a young girl}} for whom doctors had given up hope.

5|$|A {{defendant}} must {{be given}} an opportunity to retain counsel, even if not entitled to appointed counsel.

50|$|The Copyright Act 1957 {{provides}} {{three kinds}} of remedies - administrative remedies, civil remedies and criminal <b>remedies.</b> <b>The</b> administrative <b>remedies</b> provided under <b>the</b> statute include detention of the infringing goods by the customs authorities. <b>The</b> civil <b>remedies</b> are provided under Chapter XII of the Copyright Act 1957 and <b>the</b> <b>remedies</b> provided include injunctions, damages and account of profits. <b>The</b> criminal <b>remedies</b> are provided under Chapter XIII of the statute and <b>the</b> <b>remedies</b> provided against copyright infringement include imprisonment (up to 3 years) along with a fine (up to 200,000 Rupees).|$|R
50|$|In certain circumstances, <b>the</b> buyer's <b>remedy</b> {{is clearly}} {{contractual}} (enforceable {{in terms of}} the actio empti). In other circumstances, <b>the</b> <b>remedies</b> are not contractual; they find their roots in the aedilitian actions of Roman law.

Historically, contractual actions entitle the buyer to consequential damages, while <b>the</b> aedilitian <b>remedies</b> do not.

5|$|Assuming for the {{purposes}} of argument, however, that evolution is a religion or religious tenet, <b>the</b> <b>remedy</b> is to stop the teaching of evolution, not establish another religion in opposition to it.

5|$|At least 120 drugs {{come from}} plant sources, {{many of them}} from the bark of trees. Quinine {{originates}} from the cinchona tree (Cinchona) and was for a long time <b>the</b> <b>remedy</b> of choice for the treatment of malaria. Aspirin was synthesised to replace the sodium salicylate derived from the bark of willow trees (Salix) which had unpleasant side effects. The anti-cancer drug Paclitaxel is derived from taxol, a substance found in the bark of the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia). Other tree based drugs come from the paw-paw (Carica papaya), the cassia (Cassia spp.), the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao), the tree of life (Camptotheca acuminata) and the downy birch (Betula pubescens).|$|E
5|$|During December 2011, GM {{conducted}} four crash {{tests of}} Volts with the reinforced steel and upgraded cooling system, resulting in no intrusion to the battery and no coolant leakage.

5|$|The Court of Chancery could grant three {{possible}} remedies– specific performance, injunctions and damages. <b>The</b> <b>remedy</b> of specific performance is, in contractual matters, an order {{by the court}} which requires the party in breach of contract to perform his obligations. The validity of the contract {{as a whole was}} not normally considered, only whether there was adequate consideration and if expecting the party that breached the contract to carry out his obligations was viable. Injunctions, on the other hand, are remedies which prevent a party from doing something (unlike specific performance, which requires them to do something). Until the Common Law Procedure Act 1854, the Court of Chancery was the only body qualified to grant injunctions and specific performance.|$|E
5|$|I am {{of opinion}} {{that by the}} terms and spirit of the statute under which this {{proceeding}} has been had, no other than the district attorney of the county of Genesee (in which the lands intruded upon are situated) could regularly be a relator. <b>The</b> <b>remedy</b> for the act complained of {{is provided by the}} statute, as well as the officers to carry it into execution. It is made the duty of the district attorney to make complaint of all intrusions upon Indian lands forbidden by the act, {{and from time to time}} to make inquiries whether any persons other than Indians are settled upon such lands, and to cause them to be removed in the manner therein prescribed. Without the act, John Blacksmith or any other person could not claim such summary proceedings to remove intruders upon Indian lands; and with the act, no other person is authorized by its provisions to make complaint of such intrusions, or to cause the intruders to be removed, but the district attorney of the county in which the lands are situated.|$|E
5|$|Rum-runners {{used the}} Everglades as a hiding spot during Prohibition; {{it was so}} vast there were never enough law {{enforcement}} officers to patrol it. The arrival of the railroad, and the discovery that adding trace elements like copper was <b>the</b> <b>remedy</b> for crops sprouting and dying quickly, soon created a population boom. New towns such as Moore Haven, Clewiston, and Belle Glade sprouted like the crops. Sugarcane became the primary crop grown in South Florida. Miami experienced a second real estate boom that earned a developer in Coral Gables $150million. Undeveloped land north of Miami sold for $30,600 an acre. In 1925, Miami newspapers published editions weighing over , {{most of it in}} real estate advertising. Waterfront property was the most highly valued. Mangrove trees were cut down and replaced with palm trees to improve the view. Acres of South Florida slash pine were cleared. Some of the pine was for lumber, but most of the pine forests in Dade County were cleared for development.|$|E
