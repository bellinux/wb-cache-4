5000|$|Clarke died {{by natural}} causes while bushwalking in the Grampians National Park in the Australian state of Victoria. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten, and New Zealand Prime Minister Bill English {{paid tribute to}} {{his role as a}} {{political}} satirist, Turnbull saying: [...] "His satire served a noble purpose. It spoke truth to power. It made our democracy richer and stronger. It kept politicians on their toes." [...] Clarke's work was presented on ABC radio and television over a period of nearly 30 years. In tribute to him and his work, the ABC repeated many pieces after his death, including his guest presentation for ABC Classic FM from October 2016 and the three-part documentary Sporting Nation, repeated on ABC television. ABC television also screened a program containing tributes from Dawe and other friends, politicians, colleagues and comedians entitled John Clarke: <b>Thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>Time.</b> Many episodes of Clarke & Dawe were re-released online and interviews repeated on ABC Radio. Comedian and fellow New Zealander Tony Martin delivered a tribute to Clarke at the 2017 Logie Awards.|$|E

I am aware that many have come from outside the NUEPA campus as well as from within it, and I express sincere <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>time</b> and attention. I address this audience on the theme of financing of education with some hesitation, since I know that many of you are experts in this subject. NUEPA {{has a long history of}} path-breaking work in this domain, and many among you have additional expertise from other institutions and contexts. I trust that we shall be able to benefit from this expertise during the period set aside after the lecture for discussion. And I also hope that the perspectives that I shall present will complement yours and perhaps stimulate further thinking. You will have noted from my title that I will address the topic from the perspective of UNESCO’s International Institute for Educational Planning (IIEP), of which I became the eighth Director in March 2006. I will talk about some of IIEP’s past work in this domain, and about plans for the future. I shall also refer to some of my own work.

40|$|Cross {{section and}} {{reaction}} rate {{coefficients for the}} creation of Methane (CH 4) and it's derivatives are processed for use in the Monte Carlo simulation code DIVIMP (DIVertor IMPurity). Due to a lack of verifiable experimental data for individual methane fragment reaction cross sections, consideration of hydrocarbons in the plasma solution has been left out of DIVIMP until now. A new module has been developed with utmost flexibility and expandability in mind for integration into DIVIMP. This module follows the state of a hydrocarbon molecule and in a Monte Carlo way, tracks the interactions it undergoes as electrons and protons collide with the fragment. Program structure and development as well as examples of single-step and full-fragment evolution are presented. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would like to thank Professor Peter Stangeby for his council and willingness to take me on for a significant project while so far away from Toronto. It's {{been a long time since}} I first wrote Prof. Stangeby for information regarding fusion- now that I'm here I know there's no other place I'd rather be.

40|$|Abstract Thesis: We {{do because}} we want and {{we are able to}} -about a group and their manager and how they {{together}} have worked with, and today working with, resist to change. Programme: SO 2030 E: 3, Linnaeus University Level: Bachelor Thesis Year/semester: Spring 2015 Authors: Pia Steinbach Mastenstrand and Rebecca Welander Supervisor: Magnus Persson Keywords: Change management, leadership, mechanism of inertia, power, quality improvement Background: The work with quality improvement within the geriatric care is a constant work in progress where implementation of new guidelines and routines is an essential part. This study highlights a workgroup that has {{over the last four years}} progressed from mainly not following new guidelines and routines to be successful in 2014 at the audit performed by The Health and Social Care Inspectorate where no deviations concerning quality were found. The purpose with this paper is to understand how the studied working group and their manager together have managed the resistance to change and the mechanics of inertia. Theory: Ahrne and Papakostas (2002) theory about the mechanism of inertia has been used to highlight the obstacles that are present in an organization during change management. Ahrne and Hedströms (1999) theory of distribution of power has been used to understand the managers power of position and how this can be used to manage change in a working group. Durkheim’s (2004) theory of structures describes the influence on the wellbeing of the employee. Method: A qualitative case study has been performed on a working group and their manager at a geriatric care home by interviews and observations, totally seven interviews and two meeting observations. Result: For a group that is functioning in a god way a lot of what the previous science provides about for example participation is important to work with to achieve quality improvement. But when a group is working in a dysfunction way and the context more or less is chaos, the manager first have to work with the structure. This to be able to make the group grow first before the members can participate in daily work and quality improvement. Thanks: Many thanks to the studied group and their manager for your time and thoughts about their work. Many thanks also to Magnus Persson that has guided us within the sociological way of thinking. <b>Thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>time</b> and your wise input...|$|E
