5|$|From Russia, with Love is {{the fifth}} novel by the English author Ian Fleming to feature his fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond. Fleming wrote the story in early 1956 at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica; at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it might be his final Bond book. The novel was first {{published}} in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape on 8 April 1957.|$|E
25|$|In His Last Stand (1890), a cornered bear in {{the middle}} of a prairie is brought down by dogs and riflemen, which may have been a symbolized {{treatment}} of the dying Indians he had witnessed. Remington's attitude toward Native Americans was typical for <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> them unfathomable, fearless, superstitious, ignorant, and pitiless—and generally portrayed them as such. White men under attack were brave and noble.|$|E
25|$|When later {{interviewed for}} a {{television}} video program, Trotter stated {{that all of}} the components were rated to handle the combined weight of the participants, and, at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> the assembly was safe. Later studies showed that his design had failed {{to take into account the}} increased g-load caused by the pendulum action of the jump, exceeding the ratings on the components and leading to catastrophic failure of the structural integrity of the bungee cable. Since the accident, no other groups have attempted to perform a stunt jump from the bridge. This incident was broadcast on the television program Destroyed in Seconds, on March 2, 2009.|$|E

50|$|Zagata {{had been}} {{presented}} with a police lineup including Majczek but {{had been unable to}} positively identify Majczek. He restated this at the later trial. Subsequently, Zagata told <b>the</b> <b>Times,</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> neither of <b>the</b> convicted men fitted his recollection of the killers. He was certain that the true killers had been much taller than the short-statured Majczek. Zagata also said that Judge Molthrop had requestioned him {{a few days after the}} verdict - the judge was particularly interested in Zagata's issues with the identification. Zagata recalled the judge saying he was going to get a retrial for the two men.|$|R

500|$|On {{that first}} mission, Tibbets saw in {{real-time}} that his bombs were falling on innocent civilians. [...] At <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> to himself, [...] "People are getting killed down there that don't have any business getting killed. [...] Those are not soldiers." [...] But {{then he thought}} back to a lesson he had learned during his time at medical school from his roommate who was a doctor. [...] This doctor explained to him about his former classmates who failed the program {{and ended up in}} drug sales. [...] The reason why they had failed the program was because [...] "they had too much sympathy for their patients", which [...] "destroyed their ability to render the medical necessities". [...] It dawned on Tibbets that: ...|$|E
500|$|The type {{specimen}} of Thescelosaurus (USNM7757) {{was discovered in}} 1891 by paleontologists John Bell Hatcher and William H. Utterback, from beds of the late Maastrichtian-age Upper Cretaceous Lance Formation of Niobrara County (at the time part of Converse County), Wyoming, USA. The skeleton, however, remained in its shipping crates for years until Charles W. Gilmore of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History had it prepared and described it in a short paper in 1913, naming it T. neglectus (neglectus: [...] "neglected"). At <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it was related to Camptosaurus. He provided a detailed monograph in 1915, describing the well-preserved skeleton. The {{type specimen}} was found largely in natural articulation and was missing only the head and neck, which were lost due to erosion. The name comes from the surprise Gilmore felt at finding such a good specimen that had been unattended to for so long. [...] He considered {{it to be a}} light, agile creature, and assigned it to the Hypsilophodontidae, a family of small bipedal dinosaurs.|$|E
500|$|Charles Darwin's {{publication}} of the On the Origin of Species in 1859 was a watershed event in all the life sciences, especially paleontology. Fossils had {{played a role in}} the development of Darwin's theory. In particular he had been impressed by fossils he had collected in South America during the voyage of the Beagle of giant armadillos, giant sloths, and what at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> were giant llamas that seemed to be related to species still living on the continent in modern times. The scientific debate that started immediately after the {{publication of}} Origin led to a concerted effort to look for transitional fossils and other evidence of evolution in the fossil record. There were two areas where early success attracted considerable public attention, the transition between reptiles and birds, and the evolution of the modern single-toed horse. In 1861 the first specimen of Archaeopteryx, an animal with both teeth and feathers and a mix of other reptilian and avian features, was discovered in a limestone quarry in Bavaria and described by Richard Owen. Another would be found in the late 1870s and put on display at a Museum in Berlin in 1881. Other primitive toothed birds were found by Othniel Marsh in Kansas in 1872. Marsh also discovered fossils of several primitive horses in the Western United States that helped trace the evolution of the horse from the small 5-toed Hyracotherium of the Eocene to the much larger single-toed modern horses of the genus Equus. Thomas Huxley would make extensive use of both the horse and bird fossils in his advocacy of evolution. Acceptance of evolution occurred rapidly in scientific circles, but acceptance of Darwin's proposed mechanism of natural selection as the driving force behind it was much less universal. In particular some paleontologists such as Edward Drinker Cope and Henry Fairfield Osborn preferred alternatives such as neo-Lamarckism, the inheritance of characteristics acquired during life, and orthogenesis, an innate drive to change in a particular direction, to explain what they perceived as linear trends in evolution.|$|E

Ivanov bought it at Christie's in London on Nov. 28, 2007, for 9 million pounds ($18.5 million at <b>the</b> <b>time),</b> because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> {{that it is}} Fabergé’s “finest ever.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Guitarist The Edge {{had a long}} {{appreciation}} of musician Brian Eno's work, and admired his ambient and [...] "weird works". The band were also fond of his work with Talking Heads. Having never worked with music such as U2's, Eno was also initially reluctant. When the band played him Under a Blood Red Sky, his eyes [...] "glazed over". Eno had brought along his engineer Daniel Lanois to his meeting with U2 intending to recommend Lanois work with the band instead. Eno's earlier doubts were resolved by Bono's power of persuasion and his increasing perception {{of what he called}} [...] "U2's lyrical soul in abundance", traits which had become less evident on the War album. Eno commented that the band were [...] "constantly struggling against it as if they were frightened of being overpowered by some softness". Eno was impressed by how they spoke, which was not in terms of music or playing, but in terms of their contributions to the [...] "identity of the band as a whole". Eno and Lanois eventually agreed to produce the record. Eno explained that he focused on the ideas and conceptual aspects, while Lanois handled the production aspects. In Bill Graham's words, Eno's task was to [...] "help them mature a new, more experimental and European musical vocabulary". Island Records boss Chris Blackwell initially tried to talk them out of hiring Eno, believing that just when the band were about to achieve the highest levels of success, Eno would [...] "bury them under a layer of avant-garde nonsense". Nick Stewart, also of Island Records, said that at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> they were [...] "mad", but that the group's decision to stretch themselves and find an extra dimension became the [...] "turning point in their career".|$|E

60|$|The fact is, Unc' Billy was {{thinking}} of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> when <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had heard the voice of {{an old friend of}} his from way down South, and he was beginning to suspect that he had been right, and that his old friend really was somewhere in the Green Forest.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, Britton {{attempted}} {{to escape from}} a grave in the Buried Alive challenge, made famous by Houdini in 1915.

Britton failed to escape and lost consciousness, requiring him to be dug out by assistants.|$|R
500|$|... "Bart's Inner Child" [...] {{was written}} by George Meyer and {{directed}} by Bob Anderson. It was Anderson's directorial debut on The Simpsons.

At <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> she was dressed not unlike the women of his own stair, but this defect in his vision he mended afterward, as you may hear. Of course, he rose and trotted by her side like a dog, looking up at {{her as if she were}} a cathedral; but she mistook his awe for impudence and sent him sprawling, with the words, [...] "Tak that, you glowering partan!" ...|$|E
60|$|The key turned {{easily in}} the lock. Hans entered, half frightened at what he was doing, {{and the first thing}} he beheld was a heap of bones. That was not very cheerful; and he was just going out again when his eye fell on a shelf of books. Here was a good way of passing <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> for he was fond of reading, and he took one of the books from the shelf. It was all about magic, and told you how you could change {{yourself}} into anything in the world you liked. Could anything be more exciting or more useful? So he put it in his pocket, and ran quickly away out of the mountain by a little door which had been left open.|$|E
60|$|On {{the way up}} to {{the lean}} man's house you pass a little village, all of houses like the king's house, so that as you ride by you can see {{everybody}} sitting at dinner, or, if it is night, lying in their beds by lamplight; because all the people are terribly afraid of ghosts, and would not lie in the dark for anything. After the village, there is only one more house, and that is the lean man's. For the people are not very many, and live all by the sea, and the whole inside of the island is desert woods and mountains. When the lean man goes into the forest, he is very much ashamed to own it, but he is always in a terrible fright. The wood is so great, and empty, and hot, and it is always filled with curious noises: birds cry like children, and bark like dogs; and he can hear people laughing and felling trees; and the other day (when he was far in the woods) he heard a sound like the biggest mill-wheel possible, going with a kind of dot-and-carry-one movement like a dance. That was the noise of an earthquake away down below him in the bowels of the earth; and that is the same thing as to say away up toward you in your cellar in Kilburn. All these noises make him feel lonely and scared, and he doesn't quite know what he is scared of. Once when he was just about to cross a river, a blow struck him on the top of his head, and knocked him head-foremost down the bank and splash into the water. It was a nut, I fancy, that had fallen from a tree, by which accident people are sometimes killed. But at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it was a Black Boy.|$|E

I've never done it before." ...|$|R
