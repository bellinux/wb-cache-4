40|$|Proposing {{the term}} ‘congruent ethos’ for {{studying}} Old Testament ethics, this article indicates (in line with existing research) that opposing ethical viewpoints {{are found in}} the Old Testament. The modus operandi followed was firstly to compare the penitential prayer in Daniel 9 : 4 – 19 with those in Ezra 9 : 6 – 15 and Nehemiah 9 : 6 – 37. This comparison shows that the phenomenon of conflicting ethics was present in Yehud during the Second Temple period. Whilst the Daniel text reflects a more universal attitude, the penitential prayers in Ezra and Nehemiah propose a nationalist view of God and an exclusivist identity for Israel. Although Daniel can be dated later than Ezra-Nehemiah, the tendency to juxtapose an exclusivist viewpoint with an inclusivist one was already present in the earlier period of the Second Temple. This is evidenced by the literature of Isaiah 56 – 66, Ruth, Jonah, Esther, Tobit, Judith and even Joshua. How to cite this article: Venter, P.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to develop a {{specific}} approach to interpreting New Testament use of the Old Testament. The approach has integrated the most useful insights of studies in both Second Temple Judaism and present day literary theory in order to reach most consistently and effectively a valid explanation of the biblical data. In the process, severalimportant hermeneutical issues have been addressed. The focus of New Testament use of the Old Testament in the person and redemptive work of Jesus should always be the goal of Christian interpretation. Whilst old and new texts mutually interpret one another, it has been argued that there has been no ultimate ambiguity about the author’s intended, singular meaning or distortion of the original meaning of the old text. It is important to be aware that all readers come to a text with preconceived worldviews that are inevitably a mixture of biblical and unbiblical perspectives. However, this does not prevent a reader from attaining a valid understanding that adequately overlaps with the most probable meaning of the text as intended by the author. This most probable meaning is determined by the explanation that logically makes the most coherent and natural sense of most biblical data. The methodological procedure proposed has taken thegrammatical-historical method as the normative starting point of exegesis. It has then proceeded to imitate the New Testament in consideration of the broader canonical context, before considering explanations derived from <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>literature</b> or present day literary theory.

40|$|The {{author of}} 1 John interprets Christ 2 ̆ 7 s death as the atoning {{sacrifice}} {{for the sins}} of the world (2 : 2; 4 : 10). According to 1 John, the Son is the Savior of the world (4 : 14) in terms of his role as the atoning sacrifice (4 : 10), and {{on the basis of his}} accomplished work of atonement, the Son is the heavenly advocate for believers (2 : 1), and for his name 2 ̆ 7 s sake the sins of the believers are forgiven (2 : 12). This study is based upon the premise that this particular interpretation of the Christ event can be best understood against the backdrop of the two Jewish traditions of eschatological forgiveness and atonement, and the early church 2 ̆ 7 s concept of realized eschatology. Part 1 focuses upon the hermeneutical milieu of the use of the atonement themes in 1 John. Part 1 is divided into two sections. Part 2 draws together the elements of the two Jewish expectations, and uses them to elucidate the treatment of atonement and forgiveness in 1 John. We conclude: (1) that Second Temple Judaism had an eschatological expectation that God would restore the fortunes of Israel, and the later OT prophets and at least some Jews during the Second Temple period referred to these in the language of atonement and forgiveness of Israel 2 ̆ 7 s corporate sin; (2) that 1 John, building upon the Jewish traditions of forgiveness and cultic atonement in the OT and the Second Temple writings, combined the two traditions in its presentation of the atoning death of Jesus Christ and the forgiveness of sin; (3) that 1 John is distinctive, in comparison with the later OT prophets and <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>literature,</b> primarily in its application of these Jewish elements to the death of Jesus in the new way of universalizing, individualizing, and spiritualizing the national and corporate hopes of Israel; and (4) that this distinctive aspect of 1 John has its roots in the early church 2 ̆ 7 s concept of realized eschatology as expressed in the Gospels, which is itself founded upon the kingdom teachings of Jesus...|$|E

40|$|In {{the first}} century CE Jewish {{identity}} was defined {{in a context of}} significant religious diversity. This presents those who read Paul’s Letters with a problem: how to locate Paul’s thought within the complicated matrix of Jewish intellectual traditions of this period. A comparative analysis of the Messiah in the Book of the Parables of Enoch and the Letters of Paul, this study locates one aspect of Paul’s thought, his christology, in the context of Jewish intellectual traditions of {{the first century}} CE. Conceptual elements of messianic traditions are identified in these documents by examining the nature and functions of the divine figure and the nature and functions of the messiah figure. This has implications for understanding divine and human agency and the relationships between mediatorial figures and the one God in Jewish <b>literature</b> from <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> period. <b>The</b> <b>literature</b> demonstrates a complex variety of expressions for describing interactions between the divine figure and all other created beings. Comparative analysis demonstrates that the Book of the Parables and the Letters of Paul share specific conceptual elements of messianic traditions. The combination of shared elements is so striking as to preclude the possibility that the Book of the Parables and the Letters of Paul constituted independent, parallel developments. It cannot be claimed, however, that Paul was familiar with the text of the Book of the Parables; there are no direct quotes of the Book of the Parables anywhere in Paul’s Letters. We can say, however, that Paul was familiar with the conceptual elements of the Enochic messiah, and that Paul developed his concept of the Kyrios out of the Son of Man traditions in the Book of the Parables of Enoch. This study argues that at least one facet of Paul’s thought, his christology, was heavily influenced by Enochic Son of Man traditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} Melkisedeq has been highly fragmentary among modern scholars, {{proving to be}} {{difficult}} to discuss over <b>the</b> long <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> Period. This study will focus on the social memory of Melkisedeq to understand the evolution of the tradition surrounding his character among sectarian groups in <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> Period. Through an analysis of the components from the Hebrew Bible that compromise the social memory of Melkisedeq a deeper understanding of how his memory is used by later groups can be made. The redaction and expansion of his character changes greatly over time. The study of social memory allows scholars to understand how different memories form within a collective group, thus exploring the societal and ideological elements of disparate groups that form the over-arching memory of Melkisedeq. In order to properly identify these memories, redactional, historical, and textual criticisms will be employed to analyze the texts of Melkisedeq, answering such questions as: Who is Melkisedeq? What is the relationship between Melkisedeq and the king of Sodom? What is a priest-king? Did Abram tithe to Melkisedeq? This study will address the Near Eastern context of Melkisedeq in Genesis 14, in order to examine which features of his social memory are accentuated or excluded in <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>literature...</b>|$|R
40|$|As {{the title}} of the present work ("Christological re-reading of the Shema [Deut 6. 4]in Mark's Gospel") indicates, the present thesis explores the {{question}} of how the Shema is used and undersstood in Mark's Gospel. The main point to be argued is that the Shema language of Deut 6. 4 is not simply reiterated in a traditional sense but is re-read in a programmatic way that links Jesus directly with Israel's God and presents Jesus in equivalence to that unique God. While such an innovative re-reading needs to be views within the context of Mark's complex portrait of Jesus' relationship to God, which integrated Jesus' fundamental correspondence to God and his distinction from God, the one-God language in Mark appears {{to be used in the}} context of portraying Jesus as fundamentally corresponding to Israel's God, rather than being differentiated from him. Following chapter 1, which discusses the history of research, the combined methodology of composition and narrative criticisms and the life setting of Mark's Gospel, chapter 2 addresses <b>the</b> issue of <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> Judaism. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> chapter aims to argue that Judaism in <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> period should be seen as "monotheistic" despite its diversity and the widespread recognition of the exalted mediating figures in the era, and that the concern for God's uniqueness was central among the Jews of this time. In chapters 3 - 4, specific Markan texts are explored in an attempt to present a fresh reading of the Shema (12. 29; cf. v. 32; 2. 7; 10. 18). The third chapter argues for the collectivity of 12. 28 - 34 and 12. 35 - 37, which ultimately unites the confession of the Shema (12. 29) and the view of the exalted Messiah alongside God (v. 36). Chapter 4 deals with the two Markan Shema-allusions (2. 7 and 10. 18). It is argued that the Markan use of the είς ό θεός phrase in 2. 7 has a strong Christological thrust, namely to attribute to Jesus as God-like authority to forgive sins and, by doing so, to link Jesus inseparably with the one-God of Israel and to present Jesus in equivalence to God. While examining different interpretations of Mark 10. 18, <b>the</b> <b>second</b> part of <b>the</b> chapter argues that the εί μη είς θεός phrase in 10. 18 needs to be read in light of the identical phraseology of 2. 7 and that, if so, Jesus' objection to the epithet "good teacher" in 10. 18 serves to invite a more adequate understanding of Jesus' status and significance. Jesus' additional commands with the Decalogue in v. 21 and Mark's description of Jesus' unique qualities throughout his narrative tend to support the suggested reading. Lastly, chapter 4 integrates the discussions of the previous chapters in light of the macro-text, i. e., Mark's narrative as a whole. It is argued here that Mark's Christology is not monolithic, but a nuanced one, which facilitates the concurrence of Jesus' fundamental correspondence to God and Jesus' distinction from God. It is also argued that the aspects of Jesus' inseparable linkage to God and his distinction from God, alike, appear repeatedly across the narrative and that both aspects are integrally bound up with each other in the Gospel. Mark's innovative re-reading of the Shema, therefore, needs to be viewed within the context of this complexity in Jesus' relation to God. The present thesis can benefit Markan scholarship in several ways. It contributes not only to the study of Mark's theo-logy, but also Christology since Mark's Gospel is a narrative about Jesus - whose orientation is consistently theo-centric. As a result, the relationship between the two will also be illuminated. Moreover, in view of <b>the</b> inclusion of <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> <b>literature</b> (chap. 2) as a primary background for the discussion of Mark's one-God language (chaps. 3 - 5), the thesis can offer valuable insights for the twenty-first-century readers of Mark's first-century Gospel, whose idea of God's "one-ness" has been formed largely under the influence of the seventeenth-century definition of the term.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the early Jewish {{reception of the}} love command (Lev 19 : 18) during <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> period. Although <b>the</b> ascendancy of this command as the “greatest” command in later Jewish and Christian writings is well-known, the historical interpretative process through which this levitical love command came {{to be viewed as}} such is not widely known. The thesis begins by examining the meaning of Lev 19 : 18 in its original context and then systematically traces its interpretation in <b>Second</b> <b>Temple,</b> Jewish <b>literature</b> by carefully examining its citations in context. The study {{examines the}} Greek translation of Lev 19 : 18 in the Septuagint, followed by a series of sustained exegetical analyses of interpretations of Lev 19 : 18 in the Book of Jubilees, the Damascus Document, the Community Rule, Galatians, Romans, James, and the Synoptic Gospels. Although the citations of Lev 19 : 18 are infrequent in <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> period, a careful consideration of each occurrence demonstrates diverse, if complex, developments vis-à-vis Lev 19 : 18. It is argued that no mainstream Jewish interpretation of Lev 19 : 18 existed during <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Temple</b> period, and <b>the</b> analysis repudiates a simplistic, evolutionary trajectory (e. g., from restricted, intra-communal obligation to universal altruism) regarding its interpretative development.
