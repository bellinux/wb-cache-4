5|$|As {{with the}} {{original}} game, The Shivering Isles is an open-ended expansion. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>quest</b> may be delayed or completely ignored as the player explores the game world, follows side quests, interacts with non-player characters, and develops a character according to their taste. Once the game is updated the player can access the extra content at any time with any character.|$|E
5|$|Bethesda's Todd Howard first {{confirmed}} during E3 2008 that downloadable content (DLC) {{would be}} prepared for the Xbox 360 and Windows versions of Fallout 3. There are five DLCs: Operation: Anchorage, The Pitt, Broken Steel, Point Lookout, and Mothership Zeta, released in that order. Of the five, Broken Steel has the largest effect on the game, altering the ending and allowing the player to continue playing past the end of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quest</b> line.|$|E
5|$|Knights of the Nine is {{identical}} to the gameplay of Oblivion; the basic design, maneuvers, and interfaces remain unchanged. As such, it is a fantasy-based role-playing adventure game. Players begin Oblivion by defining their character; deciding on its skill set, specialization, physical features, and race. Knights of the Nine is an example of open-ended-style gameplay: <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quest</b> may be delayed or completely ignored as the player explores the game world, follows side quests, interacts with NPCs, and develops a character according to their taste. Furthering the goal of open-ended gameplay, Knights of the Nine, unlike Bethesda's prior content packs for Oblivion, begins with no explicit prodding towards the newly introduced content; players must seek out and find the game's quest without external aid.|$|E

50|$|Throughout the 2003 {{video game}} the players control Bilbo, voiced by Michael Beatie. The game follows {{the plot of}} the book, but adds the {{elements}} of platform gameplay and various side-objectives along <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quests.</b>|$|R
5|$|Rather than a single, {{overarching}} plot, {{the story}} of Legend of Mana is composed of a multitude of quests split into three <b>main</b> <b>quest</b> arcs, numerous other quests, and a final <b>quest</b> arc. Each <b>main</b> <b>quest</b> arc contains optional side-quests in addition to <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quests.</b> Whenever <b>the</b> player completes the required portions {{of one of the}} quest arcs they are allowed to begin the final arc and finish the game, even if the other arcs have not yet been started or completed. <b>The</b> three <b>main</b> <b>quest</b> arcs prior to the final arc are: the Jumi arc, the Larc and Sierra arc, and the Matilda and Irwin arc.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quest</b> of defeating the Gym Leaders, there are side quests {{in which the}} player can aid NPCs by fulfilling tasks (usually obtaining items); other side quests involve catching legendary Pokémon. The most prominent subplot involves Team Aqua and Team Magma, crime syndicates who want to use Pokémon to alter the climate of Hoenn. In Ruby, the villains, Team Magma, {{want to use the}} legendary Pokémon Groudon to dry up the oceans of Hoenn and increase the region's landmass; in Sapphire, the Team Aqua are the villains and they try to use Groudon's counterpart, Kyogre, to increase the region's water levels. The player's father also introduces the player to Wally, a sickly young boy whom the player helps capture a Pokémon to be his companion as he moves away from the big city. Wally eventually overcomes his illness and becomes a successful Pokémon trainer, ultimately becoming the final challenger the player must face before the Elite Four.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is set in}} the Mushroom Kingdom, {{beginning}} as Mario and Luigi are {{relaxing in}} their house when the mail arrives with a letter, which turns out to be an invitation from Peach to a party. Mario and Luigi then head to the castle, and as Mario is about to have some quiet time with Peach, her castle is suddenly lifted by Bowser's fortress. After his invasion and victory over Mario, the attached fortress serves as the location for playable side quests of the kidnapped Peach. In <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quest,</b> Mario tries to retrieve all of the 7 imprisoned Star Spirits on land, where most of the locations are linked to the central Toad Town, which acts as the game's hub area. The story's main conflict arises when Bowser invades Star Haven, the residence for the Star Spirits, and steals the Star Rod.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} on the {{floating}} island of Skyloft and surrounding airborne islands; and the three Surface overworlds {{where the majority of}} the main adventure takes place. Side quests for the town's citizens are unlocked as the game progresses. The different areas of the Surface are accessed through portals in the clouds. Side quests for characters of the Surface are also available, and sometimes mandatory for completing <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quest.</b> The Skyloft overworld is navigated with a great bird called a Loftwing, while the Surface is navigated on foot. Marker beacons can be set on the map for Link to follow, and save points in the form of statues preserve Link's progress up to that point. During his quest, Link is aided by the sword spirit Fi, who is able to give hints to the player for both environmental elements and enemies: for example, when an enemy is targeted and Fi is summoned, she will give the enemy's characteristics and weaknesses.|$|E
5000|$|Players control <b>the</b> <b>main</b> {{characters}} as they travel around ancient China and complete missions. The game has a main storyline and side quests, which require {{the players to}} obtain items, travel to specific scenery or kill monsters. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>quests</b> allow <b>the</b> player to proceed onto the next stage and continue with the story-line, while the side quests tell stories about non-player characters and provide information about skills. Every town there is a noticeboard where players can accept missions, collect points and compete in the rankings.|$|R
40|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quests</b> {{in quantum}} metrology, and quantum {{parameter}} estimation in general, {{is to find}} out the highest achievable precision with given resources and design schemes that attain that precision. In this article we present a general framework for quantum parameter estimation which relates the ultimate precision limit directly to the underlying dynamics. With this framework we present systematical methods for computing the ultimate precision limit and optimal probe states. We further demonstrate the power of the framework by deriving a sufficient condition on when ancillary systems are not useful for improving the precision limit. Comment: 14 pages.

The Dreamers who harassed the Nerevarine fall silent, and the Nerevarine becomes widely known as the savior of Vvardenfell. The quintessential consequence of defeating Dagoth Ur was {{the destruction of the}} Heart of Lorkhan.

25|$|There {{are five}} pieces of {{downloadable}} content (DLC) for the Bethesda action role-playing video game Fallout 3. Each package of downloadable content adds new missions, new locales to visit, and new {{items for the}} player to make use of. Of the five, Broken Steel has the largest effect on the game, altering the ending, increasing the level cap to 30, and allowing the player to continue playing past the end of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quest</b> line. The Game of The Year edition of Fallout 3 includes the full game and all five pieces of downloadable content.|$|E
25|$|For Mass Effect: Andromeda, BioWare {{incorporated}} a lighter tone than previous installments in the series, utilized open world elements, and placed {{an emphasis on}} exploration. Many of the series' traditional gameplay elements remain, while others are modified, such as combat, which is less cover-based and more mobile. The game is {{the largest in the}} series, and offers the player the freedom to focus on either <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quest</b> or side quests. Its score was composed by John Paesano and aims to match the game's mood by capturing the adventure of space exploration.|$|E
25|$|Broken Steel is {{the third}} and most {{significant}} downloadable content pack, altering the original ending of Fallout 3 and allowing the player to continue playing past the end of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quest</b> line. If the player personally activates Project Purity, their character no longer dies but instead wakes up after a two-week coma to {{join the ranks of}} the Brotherhood of Steel and helps rid the Capital Wasteland of the Enclave once and for all. The pack raises the game's level cap from 20 to 30. It includes three main quests and three side-quests. Three Dog has new dialogue in this expansion, but no new songs are added. The new weapons in Broken Steel, including the Tesla Cannon, {{are some of the most}} powerful weapons in Fallout 3.|$|E
2500|$|The Fallout {{series of}} {{computer}} games contains numerous {{direct and indirect}} allusions to nuclear wars and potential nuclear holocaust, with a distinct 1950s cold war style.

25|$|Over {{the course}} of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quest,</b> Kain acquires many items and abilities, which {{facilitate}} increasingly nonlinear exploration. As he collects blood vials and rune pyramids, Kain's maximum blood and energy capacity rises. By drinking from blood fountains, he receives strength upgrades, faster magic regeneration, and immunity to weather effects. Weapons include iron and fire-elemental swords, a spiked mace, twin axes, and the Soul Reaver, a two-handed flamberge. Suits of iron, bone, chaos, flesh, and wraith armor feature, and each combination of equipment has advantages and drawbacks. Spells, {{in the form of}} magical tarot cards, are used in both strategic and practical contexts, their functions ranging from summoning artificial light to mind control and the evocation of lightning storms. Shapeshifting enables Kain to assume the forms of a bat, allowing for immediate travel to checkpoints; a wolf, with enhanced speed and the capacity to jump; a cloud of mist, which enables him to pass through gates and cross water; or a human, with which he can covertly interact with, or bypass, certain non-player characters. There are 100 secrets present in the game, logged if the player uncovers hidden areas, switches, and dungeons; these encompass spirit forges, at which Kain may donate a significant portion of his blood in exchange for powerful battle artifacts. A day and night cycle passes progressively—at night, Kain's attacks become more potent, and during full moon phases, some sealed doors become accessible.|$|E
500|$|The role of {{the player}} {{character}} in <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quest</b> was to be changed as well. In contrast to past games, where the player character would play a type of [...] "chosen one", Oblivion would have the player character [...] "find him, protect him, and help him." [...] Aside from that, {{in the opinion of}} Hines, [...] "the main quest has similar themes and tones as in past Elder Scrolls games", and should still feel [...] "epic", simply {{because of the way the}} gamespace is designed: with openness in mind. Improving that aspect of the experience, said Hines, came mostly in the form of improved information presentation. The system would not intrude on the experience when the player merely wishes to [...] "walk around and explore the world and do whatever he/she wants", but given the scenario where the player asks [...] "'OK, I'm ready to do the next part of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quest,</b> where do I go?'", the game would provide a ready answer, so as to avoid [...] "confusion" [...] and [...] "downtime".|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers noted {{glitches}} {{while playing}} Skyrim, some game-breaking. Nick Cowen of The Guardian {{pointed out that}} the game's glitches were a trade-off for its ambitious scope, and that he had experienced glitches that forced him to reload earlier saves. Edge began their review by criticizing the lack of polish, while still acknowledging many areas in the game which made up for it. In addition, the quality of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quest</b> divided some reviewers. While Reiner praised <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quest</b> as [...] "superbly penned" [...] and [...] "Bethesda's best effort to date", Butts and Francis criticized the fact that the story was delivered primarily through conversations and quest journals, rather than through the player's own interactions. While the dragon battles were well-received, some reviewers observed flaws in the AI for dragons. Onyett pointed out their [...] "predictable attack patterns", which Francis agreed with, claiming that [...] "fighting them never changes much: you can just ignore them until they land, then shoot them from a distance when they do". Reiner felt that, due to the repetitiveness of their attack patterns, the dragons were not challenging enough for low-level players. Edge pointed out a curve in difficulty for players who favored archery and magic, as dragons were difficult to attack while airborne.|$|E
50|$|Granado Espada has a <b>main</b> <b>quest</b> {{line that}} {{extends to the}} highest levels and zones: the Frozen Fields of the north, Errac (Zeia), the mysterious southwestern region of Castilla, {{as well as the}} {{isolated}} isle of Viron (Byron). Access to the high-level end game raids such as the Ice Wizard's Tower, Mufasa of the Occulta Fortress, Tower of Chaos in Castilla in addition to Lucifer Castle can only be gained by completing <b>the</b> <b>main</b> pioneering <b>quest</b> line and other prerequisite quests.|$|R
5|$|In 2009, {{the race}} was capped at 25 entries. When the Quest 300 starts in Whitehorse, its course follows <b>the</b> <b>main</b> Yukon <b>Quest</b> trail until the Stepping Stone {{hospitality}} stop. From there, it turns southwest, ending in Minto Landing, Yukon. The Fairbanks route follows <b>the</b> <b>main</b> trail to Circle, then reverses course, ending in Central.|$|R
50|$|The {{rest of the}} {{expansion}} integrates more fully into <b>the</b> <b>main</b> adventure. Objects like oils, new weapons, rings and armor, and runes drop amid other more common kinds of items, and the new spellbooks, including books for two previously existing spells {{that did not have}} books, and scrolls are found in the same kinds of places. New shrines are found where shrines would normally be found. The new unique monsters, which appear as palette-swapped, but otherwise normal monsters with a unique name, also appear in the Diablo quest like any other. However, there are almost no unique monsters found within Hellfires exclusive dungeons. The Hellfire dungeons are populated with new enemies that do not appear in <b>the</b> <b>main</b> Diablo <b>quest,</b> however. <b>The</b> difficulty of Hellfire dungeon floors 1-8 mirror those of levels 9-16 of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> Diablo <b>quest,</b> requiring experienced characters to explore.|$|R
500|$|GamesTM editors {{noted that}} the game is [...] "heavily steeped in RPG tradition, however, its appeal {{stretches}} far beyond the hardcore RPG demographic thanks to its ease of play, boundless ambition and focused attention to detail". Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club wrote that the game is [...] "worth playing for the sense of discovery—each environment looks different from the last and requires a nuanced reaction—makes the action addictive." [...] GameZone staff commented on how one can {{spend a lot of}} the gameplay time by leveling up his or her character, doing various quests, and customizing the character before even starting <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quest.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Minish Cap {{retains the}} general {{gameplay}} features that {{were present in}} previous Zelda installments. The main protagonist, Link, must navigate several dungeons to obtain an item or enhancement {{at the end of}} each dungeon that is pivotal towards the quest. Each of the game's [...] "bosses" [...] are defeated using the item acquired in the boss's dungeon. The game also includes multiple [...] "side quests"—optional tasks that are not part of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quest</b> but rewards for completion are beneficial to the gamer. Recurring characters in the Zelda series make appearances and some form part of side quests; for example, Tingle and his brothers must all be contacted by the player to earn a reward.|$|E
500|$|Oblivion is a {{role-playing}} game (RPG) {{that incorporates}} open-ended gameplay. The player can follow side-quests, interact with NPCs, dispatch monsters, develop their character, and travel {{anywhere in the}} province of Cyrodiil at any time while playing the game (provided that the areas are not quest-specific and otherwise inaccessible when not questing). The game never ends, and the player can continue playing after completing <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quest.</b> The gameplay includes a [...] "fast travel" [...] system, in which an icon appears on the game world map every time the player visits a new location. This excludes the game world's main cities which are already unlocked for fast travel {{from the start of the}} game. The player can arrive at the desired location instantaneously by selecting the icon on the map.|$|E
2500|$|Its {{narrative}} {{also received}} critical acclaim. Carter praised the game's cast of characters, {{which he called}} unique and interesting. He considered the narrative more involving, with players witnessing key events and making consequential choices. Wallace praised the game's dialogue and its side-quests; each was similar to a short story, and player decisions in the quests would influence {{the state of the}} world. She liked <b>the</b> game's <b>main</b> <b>quest,</b> which added more character to Geralt, and said that the romance options were a significant improvement over its predecessors. However, she was disappointed with the quality of the game's endings. Kevin Van Ord of GameSpot echoed Wallace, noting that The Witcher 3: Wild Hunts story had more characterisation for Geralt than the previous games. He welcomed the change, since it gave players emotional connections to the in-game characters. Senior enjoyed the game's side-quests, calling them [...] "a compilation of dark fantasy short stories" [...] which overshadowed <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quests.</b> Ingenito was disappointed with <b>the</b> game's <b>main</b> story, saying that there were too much padding and dull quests. PC Gamers Shaun Prescott agreed, saying that the narrative would have felt rote if the side content was not engaging. Van Ord, Wallace and Brett Phipps of VideoGamer.com praised the voice acting, with Wallace calling it the series' best. Gies from Polygon criticized that some of the female characters are overly sexualized and that there are no people of color in <b>the</b> <b>main</b> game.|$|R
500|$|Originally, {{there was}} no {{downloadable}} content announced for the PlayStation 3 version of the game. Although Bethesda had not offered an official explanation {{as to why the}} content was not released for PlayStation 3, Lazard Capital Markets analyst Colin Sebastian speculated that {{it may have been the}} result of a money deal with Bethesda by Sony's competitor, Microsoft. When asked if the PlayStation 3 version would receive an update that would enable gameplay beyond <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quest's</b> completion, Todd Howard responded, [...] "Not at this time, no." [...] However, in May 2009, Bethesda announced that the existing DLC packs (Operation: Anchorage, The Pitt and Broken Steel) would be made available for the PlayStation 3; the later two (Point Lookout and Mothership Zeta) were released for all platforms.|$|R
5000|$|The game series {{departs from}} Europe and {{centers on the}} [...] "New World," [...] the Americas. It is not {{directly}} related to the previous games in the series but it occurs in the same universe. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> characters' <b>quest</b> is to investigate mysterious [...] "windows" [...] from which vicious monsters pop out.|$|R
500|$|The Minish Cap also {{features}} a figurine-based sidequest, {{similar to that in}} [...] The player can collect [...] "Mysterious Shells" [...] like those found in hidden areas in , which sometimes appear when defeating enemies and can also be found or bought in different locations throughout the world. These can then be used in a gashapon-like machine in Hyrule Town to obtain figurines of characters, enemies or locations that Link has encountered in the course of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quest.</b> New figurines only become available once Link has met or killed the subject of that figurine. Each figurine has a short description revealing information about the game, that particular enemy's weaknesses, or the series in general. Collecting every figurine unlocks a house in Hyrule Town that contains treasure, a Piece of Heart, and the Sound Test.|$|E
500|$|From the outset, Planescape: Torments {{designers}} {{intended to}} challenge traditional role-playing game conventions: the game features no dragons, elves, goblins, or other common fantasy races; {{there are only}} three swords; the rats faced in the game can be quite challenging to defeat; and the undead sometimes prove more sympathetic than humans. The designers explained that most RPGs tend to have a [...] "correct" [...] approach to solving problems, which is almost always the morally good approach. They called this [...] "predictable and stupid" [...] and wished to make a game with greater moral flexibility, where a particular problem might have [...] "two wrongs or two rights". <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>quest</b> is not about saving the world, but about understanding The Nameless One and his immortality. Death (of the protagonist or his companions) is often just a minor hindrance, and even necessary at times.|$|E
500|$|According to Gamasutra's Matt Barton, {{some have}} argued that these changes put Morrowind closer in spirit to the {{original}} Dungeons & Dragons tabletop game, where players take a more creative role in their play, and where players are left to decide for themselves the [...] "right" [...] action. This is a view paralleled by Rolston, who has stated that [...] "The goal of every [...] game is to create something that resembles a pen and paper RPG on the computer." [...] The sheer number of quest possibilities, combined with what developer Ken Rolston identified as a lack of [...] "narrative urgency", left many critics dissatisfied with the main plot. Ken Rolston later stated that <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quest</b> might have been presented with greater force, {{in the style of the}} game's successor, , without losing the free-form design of the series, but such concerns were not addressed prior to Morrowinds release.|$|E

5000|$|God Eater 2: Rage Burst (Goddo Ītā 2 Reiji Bāsuto) is an {{enhanced}} {{version of the}} original game for the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4. It was announced at Tokyo Game Show 2014. A new chapter titled [...] "Rage Burst" [...] {{is added to the}} story, featuring content separated into six difficulty levels within <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quests.</b> Rage Burst introduces a new game mechanism known as [...] "Blood Rage", which involves filling a yellow gauge by attacking enemies, and then making a pledge to the God Arc once it activates, granting various buffs to the player. Temporary invincibility can be toggled during the pledge selection process, at the expense of draining the yellow gauge on the bottom left of the screen. The game also introduces new characters, enemies and weapon types.|$|R
25|$|Gameplay is semi-linear; most of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>quests</b> can be {{performed}} in different orders, but only from within a group of given quests. For example, in Act I, the player can choose to tackle a series of kidnappings or investigate a spate of murders, but no other <b>main</b> <b>quests</b> are made available until both quests are complete. There are also optional side-quests, which {{do not have to}} be completed immediately. There are more NPCs than in the first game, and the player can interact with many of them. Depending on which character the player is using, these NPCs may or may not provide information and assistance. Weapons, armor and items are only available for purchase from one location throughout the game, a shop in Baldur's Gate, although the stock changes at the commencement of each act, with the weapons increasing in expense and power. The HUD features the option to use either a transparent map that covers most of the screen, or a mini-map, with the player also given the option to turn the map off entirely.|$|R
