50|$|A lot {{of current}} {{civilian}} rifle clubs trace their {{history to the}} 'volunteers' of the middle 19th century, raised locally among the gentry to afford some readiness to counter the constant threat of invasion by Napoleon III. <b>These</b> <b>volunteer</b> <b>organisations</b> and military shooting clubs developed over time into civilian clubs as the <b>Volunteer</b> <b>organisations</b> were incorporated into the Territorial Army. The rise in popularity in the civilian clubs started in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, especially fullbore rifle events sponsored by the military and National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom to improve the general standard of marksmanship {{under the auspices of}} Defence of the Realm.|$|R
50|$|Australia, with 19,650 {{kilometres}} of coastline {{does not}} have a force purely to defend its coast. The duty of patrolling the Australian coastline falls to the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Border Force Maritime Border Command, and the Police services of the states. In addition, there are several private <b>volunteer</b> coast guard <b>organisations,</b> the two largest organisations being the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol (established in 1937 as the Volunteer Coastal Patrol) and the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard (established in 1961). <b>These</b> <b>volunteer</b> <b>organisations</b> have no law enforcement powers, but are essentially auxiliary Search and Rescue services. In July 2009 the three <b>organisations</b> (Royal <b>Volunteer</b> Coastal Patrol, Australian Volunteer Coast Guard and some units of the Volunteer Rescue Association's Marine Branch) united in New South Wales under the government sponsored Marine Rescue NSW. The Australian Volunteer Coast Guard remains operational in Victoria, Queensland, Northern Territory, South Australia and Tasmania alongside a number of other Volunteer Marine Rescue agencies.|$|R

2500|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Swan River Colony (later known as Western Australia), a detachment from 2nd/40th Regiment who were garrisoned in Sydney at the time, was dispatched to the new colony. Following them, were detachments from most of the regiments that were also serving in New South Wales. In addition to the British garrison, a small locally raised unit, known as the Swan River Volunteers, was established in 1829; all settlers between 15 and 50 years of age were obligated to serve and were required to supply their own weapons. Although provisions were made to pay <b>these</b> <b>volunteers,</b> the <b>organisation</b> was not successful, however, as the settlements were dispersed over wide areas, making concentration difficult, while economic considerations meant that it was not fully supported by settlers. In the early 1850s, a force of [...] "enrolled pensioners"– former soldiers– were sent to the colony to bolster the British regular garrison and to guard convicts.|$|R

40|$|Self-congruity and volunteering: a multi-organisation {{comparison}} 1. Purpose: To examine: (1) if {{individuals who}} prefer different <b>volunteering</b> <b>organisations</b> have different self-concepts; (2) if individuals perceive their preferred <b>volunteering</b> <b>organisation</b> as {{more similar to}} their self-concept than other volunteering organisations; and (3) if self-congruity theory correctly predicts consumer (volunteer) behaviour differences across organisations and organisational missions. 2. Design/methodology/approach: We collected data on people’s preferred <b>volunteering</b> <b>organisation,</b> their self-concept and their perceived image from eight <b>volunteering</b> <b>organisations</b> using an online self-completion survey. We then used chi-square tests and paired-sample t-tests to identify significant differences between groups. 3. Findings: Individuals who prefer different <b>volunteering</b> <b>organisations</b> differ significantly in their self-concept. For the three <b>volunteering</b> <b>organisations</b> {{with high levels of}} awareness and distinct images, self-congruity theory held; that is, people who volunteer for them perceive those organisations as more similar to their self-concept than other <b>volunteering</b> <b>organisations.</b> For the four organisations with lower awareness and less-distinct images, we found a tendency towards self-congruity, but results wer...|$|R

In one case, self-congruity theory did not hold, possibly due to the more “obligatory” nature of the volunteering task. Research limitations/implications: This research extends the application of self-congruity theory to the volunteering context. It identifies three key dimensions that affect the extent to which self-congruity holds for volunteering organisations: brand awareness, image distinctiveness and whether the involvement is actually “voluntary”. Practical implications: Self-congruity theory {{has the potential to be}} a valuable tool in helping <b>volunteering</b> <b>organisations</b> increase their productivity through better targeted marketing strategies. Originality/value: This study is the first to apply self-congruity theory to the volunteering sector at the organisation brand level, and gives practitioners an additional tool to improve the effectiveness of their marketing...|$|R
40|$|According to self-congruity theory, {{people prefer}} brands that they {{associate}} {{with a set}} of personality traits which are similar to their own. This notion is widely accepted by consumer researchers and has been empirically tested in a number of commercial product and service contexts. It has not, however, been tested {{in the context of the}} third sector, particularly in relation to <b>volunteering</b> <b>organisations.</b> This study finds preliminary support for two hypotheses: (1) volunteers who prefer a specific <b>volunteering</b> <b>organisation</b> over others differ significantly in their self-concept; and (2) the self-concept of volunteers who prefer a specific <b>volunteering</b> <b>organisation</b> most closely matches the perceived brand image of that <b>volunteering</b> <b>organisation.</b> Practical and theoretical implications are discussed and a future research agenda proposed...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{increased}} competitive {{pressures in}} the volunteering industry, {{the structure of}} competition within this non-profit sector has not been examined in the past. This study uses selected respondents from the 1999 - 2002 World Values Survey who have previously <b>volunteered</b> for multiple <b>organisations.</b> Based on the patterns of <b>organisations</b> that <b>volunteers</b> donated their time for, competition between <b>volunteering</b> <b>organisations</b> with different missions was analysed, resulting in five dimensions of volunteering missions within which <b>volunteering</b> <b>organisations</b> appear to be competing: altruistic, leisure, political, church, and other missions. The altruistic mission groups is the broadest and includes {{a wide variety of}} volunteering goals, whereas the church seems to stand without much competition, thus being confronted with the least competitive threat in the fight for volunteers. Such analyses would be useful for managers faced with the challenge of retaining current volunteers and recruiting new volunteers in an increasingly competitive volunteering marketplace. As such, the proposed approach represents a way of analysing the competitive market structure analysis in the volunteering market, thus providing <b>volunteering</b> <b>organisations</b> with a useful tool from the marketing toolbox...|$|R
