5|$|Those changes worsened the magazine's problems. When {{the title}} was {{shortened}} to just HG, many longtime subscribers thought they were getting a new magazine and put it aside for <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing</b> to arrive. Most of those subscriptions were eventually canceled, and while some fashion advertisers came over, most of the magazine's traditional advertisers pulled out.|$|E

50|$|In 1967, drummer John Kowalski and guitarist Bob Homa {{were in a}} Chicago-area garage {{band called}} <b>the</b> <b>Real</b> <b>Things.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>Real</b> <b>Things</b> broke up, they decided {{to form a new}} band, and placed ads in several newspapers, seeking {{additional}} musicians. On the strength of their auditions, Marc Swenson became the lead guitarist, and Gloria Lambert the lead vocalist. Homa switched from guitar to bass.|$|R

5|$|All British {{patterns}} were different, first tested on small wooden models viewed through a periscope in a studio. Most {{of the model}} designs were painted by women from London's Royal Academy of Arts.

Creative people including sculptors, artists, and set designers designed camouflage.|$|E
5|$|I {{consider}} {{him to be}} {{one of my best friends}} but <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing</b> is about managers: I think Steinman's manager is the devil and Steinman feels the same way about my manager. So, we had to communicate through managers and he refused to sign some papers that would have allowed for the recording of Bat Out of Hell III without a hitch. So, really, I didn't sue Jim Steinman. I sued his manager.|$|E

She moved to New York City in 1984 and appeared in the Broadway production of Tom Stoppard's play <b>The</b> <b>Real</b> <b>Thing</b> alongside Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close.|$|E

5|$|She {{was born}} in Paris and moved with her family to Washington, D.C., in 1966. As a child, Smith was often teased because of her voice. She became a {{professional}} actress in 1982 after graduating from drama school and moved to New York City in 1984, where she appeared in the Broadway production of Tom Stoppard's <b>The</b> <b>Real</b> <b>Thing.</b> She made her film debut in 1985's Heaven Help Us, followed by roles in The Legend of Billie Jean and Maximum Overdrive. She moved to Los Angeles in 1986 and received a recurring role in the television series Brothers. In 1987, she auditioned for a role {{in a series of}} animated shorts about the Simpson family on The Tracey Ullman Show. Smith intended to audition for the role of Bart Simpson, but the casting director felt her voice was too high, so she was assigned the role of Lisa, instead. She voiced Lisa for three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show, and in 1989, the shorts were spun off into their own half-hour show, The Simpsons. For her work as the character, Smith received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992.|$|E

25|$|Angel Dust is {{the fourth}} studio album by American rock band Faith No More. It was first {{released}} through Slash Records on June 8, 1992 in Europe and the United States. It is the follow-up to 1989's highly successful <b>The</b> <b>Real</b> <b>Thing,</b> {{as well as the}} band's final studio album with guitarist Jim Martin and the second to feature vocalist Mike Patton. It was the first album in which Patton had any substantial influence on the band's music, having been hired after the other band members had written and recorded everything for <b>The</b> <b>Real</b> <b>Thing</b> except vocals and some lyrics.|$|E

25|$|Physical {{simulation}} {{refers to}} simulation in which physical objects are substituted for <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing</b> (some circles {{use the term}} for computer simulations modelling selected laws of physics, but this article does not). These physical objects are often chosen because they are smaller or cheaper than the actual object or system.|$|E
25|$|After {{releasing}} six studio albums, {{including their}} best-selling records <b>The</b> <b>Real</b> <b>Thing</b> (1989) and Angel Dust (1992), Faith No More officially announced their breakup on April 20, 1998.

25|$|The 1936 {{race was}} {{spectacular}} for the crashes that it produced, {{because for the}} first time riders were required to negotiate everyday winding streets rather than the smooth bends of a motor-racing course. Stallard finished 17th and inspired by what he had ridden. There were more races on car circuits and airfields – Stallard won the last race at Brooklands, in 1939 – but to Stallard they were just a shadow of <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|E

60|$|We {{were afraid}} {{only of the}} dark. We had no germs of religion, no conceptions of an unseen world. We knew only <b>the</b> <b>real</b> world, and <b>the</b> <b>things</b> we feared were <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>things,</b> <b>the</b> {{concrete}} dangers, the flesh-and-blood animals that preyed. It was they that made us afraid of the dark, for darkness was {{the time of the}} hunting animals. It was then that they came out of their lairs and pounced upon one from the dark wherein they lurked invisible.|$|R
30|$|The {{situation}} is a bit comparable to Plato’s allegory of the cave, where Socrates compares the process of gaining knowledge with looking at the shadows of <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>things.</b> <b>The</b> observations ŷ are the “shadows” of the “real” things q and υ̃, and from observing the “shadows” ŷ we want to infer what “reality” is, in a way turning our heads towards it. We hence want to “free” ourselves from just observing the “shadows” and gain some understanding of “reality”.|$|R

Guildenstern fully believes he has killed the Player. Seconds later, the Tragedians begin to clap and the Player stands up and brushes himself off, revealing the knife to be a theatrical one with a retractable blade. The Tragedians then act out the deaths from the final scene of Hamlet.|$|E
25|$|Breathe was {{released}} in 1996. It was produced by Malcolm Burn and had a loose, raw style with almost a low-key sound. It peaked at No.3 on the ARIA albums chart, and had Top 40 success in New Zealand and Switzerland. They returned to No.1 on the ARIA albums charts with the compilation 20,000 Watt R.S.L. in 1997 on Sony Records, which achieved 4×Platinum sales. Later albums, Redneck Wonderland in 1998, <b>The</b> <b>Real</b> <b>Thing</b> in 2000 and Capricornia in 2002 again renuniting with producer Warne Livesey, all charted into the ARIA Top Ten.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, {{the founder}} of the Jewish Renewal movement, views God as a process. To aid in this {{transition}} in language, he uses the term “godding,” which encapsulates God as a process, as the process that the universe is doing, has been doing, and will continue to do. This term means that God is emerging, growing, adapting, and evolving with creation. Despite this, conventional God-language is still useful in nurturing spiritual experiences and can be a tool to relate to the infinite, although it {{should not be confused with}} <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Idola fori (singular Idolum fori), {{sometimes}} {{translated as}} [...] "Idols of the Market Place" [...] or [...] "Idols of the Forum", are {{a category of}} logical fallacy which results from the imperfect correspondences between the word definitions in human languages, and <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>things</b> in nature which these words represent. The term was coined in Latin by Sir Francis Bacon and used in his Novum Organum, {{one of the earliest}} treatises arguing the case for the logic and method of modern science.|$|R
60|$|The little {{party of}} late diners passed {{on their way}} to the further end of the room, leaving a wave of artificiality behind, or was it, Andrew Wilmore wondered, in a moment of half-dazed speculation, that it was they and the rest of the gay company who {{represented}} <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>things,</b> and he and his companion who were playing a sombre part in some unreal and gloomier world. Francis' voice, however, when he recommenced his diatribe, was calm and matter-of-fact enough.|$|R
5000|$|In his {{own time}} Berkeley faced {{opposition}} from many philosophers who held to the Platonic view. These philosophers thought Berkeley vulgar because his own view seemed to confirm the views held by the lower classes. Roughly speaking, the [...] "common view" [...] was that God created everything and that the things on earth were <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>things.</b> Some philosophers {{did not believe in}} God, and believed matter on earth was but an imitation of actual matter that existed in another dimension. Berkeley sided with the common view.|$|R
