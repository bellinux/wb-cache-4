5000|$|Common {{wood chips}} used in pulp {{production}} are 12 - 25 mm long and 2 - 10 mm thick. <b>The</b> <b>chips</b> normally first enter the presteaming {{where they are}} wetted and preheated with steam. Cavities inside fresh wood chips are partly filled with liquid and partly with air. The steam treatment causes the air to expand and about 25% of the air to be expelled from <b>the</b> <b>chips.</b> <b>The</b> {{next step is to}} saturate <b>the</b> <b>chips</b> with black and white liquor. Air remaining in <b>chips</b> at <b>the</b> beginning of liquor impregnation is trapped within <b>the</b> <b>chips.</b> <b>The</b> impregnation can be done before or after <b>the</b> <b>chips</b> enters <b>the</b> digester and is normally done below [...] The cooking liquors consist of a mixture of white liquor, water in chips, condensed steam and weak black liquor. In the impregnation, cooking liquor penetrates into the capillary structure of <b>the</b> <b>chips</b> and low temperature chemical reactions with the wood begin. A good impregnation is important to get a homogeneous cook and low rejects. About 40-60% of all alkali consumption in the continuous process occurs in the impregnation zone.|$|R

50|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>chip's</b> program ROM was {{eventually}} extracted, {{where it was}} found that only a fraction of <b>the</b> <b>chip's</b> space was used for these specific instructions, and that the algorithms themselves were relatively simple.|$|R
50|$|Tree {{chippers}} {{are typically}} {{made of a}} hopper with a collar, the chipper mechanism itself, and an optional collection bin for <b>the</b> <b>chips.</b> A tree limb is inserted into the hopper (the collar serving as a partial safety mechanism to keep human body parts away from <b>the</b> <b>chipping</b> blades) and started into <b>the</b> <b>chipping</b> mechanism. <b>The</b> <b>chips</b> exit through a chute and can be directed into a truck-mounted container or onto the ground.

5|$|Power is {{supplied}} to <b>the</b> <b>chip</b> in 1.7 microsecond pulses {{as determined by}} the storage time of a control transistor. An oscillator clock operating at 200 kilohertz during calculations and dropping to 15 kilohertz between each operation means shut off time ranges from 3.3 microseconds during calculations to over 65 microseconds between. The device relies on the capacitance of the chips to store information when there is no power, and 1.7 microseconds proved sufficient for <b>the</b> <b>chip</b> to carry out a single change of state of the electronics. Any calculation can be done in 1000 such changes. This had the effect of extending battery life to about 20 hours of continuous use with three small hearing aid batteries, equivalent to about four months of normal usage.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of Pong, Bushnell pushed his {{employees}} to create new products. In 1974, Atari engineer Harold Lee proposed a home version of Pong that would connect to a television: Home Pong. The system began development under the codename Darlene, named after an attractive female employee at Atari. Alcorn worked with Lee to develop the designs and prototype, and based them on the same digital technology used in their arcade games. The two worked in shifts to save time and money; Lee worked on the design's logic during the day, while Alcorn debugged the designs in the evenings. After the designs were approved, fellow Atari engineer Bob Brown assisted Alcorn and Lee in building a prototype. The prototype consisted of a device attached to a wooden pedestal containing over a hundred wires, which would eventually be replaced with a single chip designed by Alcorn and Lee; <b>the</b> <b>chip</b> {{had yet to be}} tested and built before the prototype was constructed. <b>The</b> <b>chip</b> was finished {{in the latter half of}} 1974, and was, at the time, the highest-performing chip used in a consumer product.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{parallelism}} methodologies for {{the mapping}} of {{machine learning algorithms}} derived rules on both software and hardware are investigated. Feeding the input of these algorithms with patient diseases data, medical diagnostic decision trees and their corresponding rules are outputted. These rules can be mapped on multithreaded object oriented programs and hardware <b>chips.</b> <b>The</b> programs can simulate the working of <b>the</b> <b>chips</b> and can exhibit the inherent parallelism of <b>the</b> <b>chips</b> design. <b>The</b> circuit of a chip can consist of many blocks, which are operating concurrently for {{various parts of the}} whole circuit.

5000|$|When {{a player}} lands on a covered space with an {{established}} combination, the player's reaction depends on whose chips are on that space.

5|$|Bismuth {{is used to}} make {{free-machining}} steels and free-machining {{aluminium alloys}} for precision machining properties. It has similar effect to lead and improves <b>the</b> <b>chip</b> breaking during machining. The shrinking on solidification in lead {{and the expansion of}} bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities. Similarly, alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and lead exhibit a very small change (on the order 0.01%) upon melting, solidification or aging. Such alloys are used in high-precision casting, e.g. in dentistry, to create models and molds. Bismuth is also used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons and as a thermocouple material.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to cellular stresses– such as infection, heat shock, or oxidative damage– heat shock proteins that identify misfolded or unfolded proteins and target them for proteasomal degradation are expressed.

Hsp70, on the other hand, binds exposed hydrophobic patches on the surface of misfolded proteins and recruits E3 ubiquitin ligases such as CHIP to tag the proteins for proteasomal degradation. <b>The</b> <b>CHIP</b> protein (carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein) is itself regulated via inhibition of interactions between the E3 enzyme CHIP and its E2 binding partner.|$|E

Eventually, after finding Benny and <b>the</b> <b>Chip,</b> the Courier finds themselves {{in the middle of}} a conflict between three major factions: Caesar's Legion, a group of Roman-esque slavers, the New California Republic (NCR), an expansionist democratic federation, and Mr. House (voiced by René Auberjonois), the enigmatic de facto ruler of New Vegas, in command of an army of Securitron robots that patrols the city. Each of the three sides aim to control the Hoover Dam, which is still operational and supplying the Southwest with power and clean, non-irradiated water; thus, control of the dam means effective control of the region. It is revealed that Mr. House, a human from before the Great War and surviving via a contained life support chamber, ordered the Platinum Chip's delivery before the war. <b>The</b> <b>Chip</b> is a data storage device with a program that can upgrade the Securitrons to a greater level of combat effectiveness, and was stolen by Benny as part of a scheme to take over House's security and claim New Vegas for himself with the help of a reprogrammed Securitron named Yes Man.|$|E
