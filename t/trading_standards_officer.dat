In the investigation, {{it was found that}} only three lamb curries out of the nineteen tested contained only lamb. Most were found to consist of a mixture of lamb with beef or chicken. Additionally, all of the twenty lamb kebabs that were sampled contained meats in addition to lamb that was mixed with it, such as beef, pork or chicken.|$|R
5000|$|The BBFC do {{not view}} any {{material}} which {{is exempt from}} classification and therefore do not issue any certificate of any kind. The decision to release any title as exempt from classification is not made by the BBFC, but by the distributors and/or producers themselves who have the responsibility of ensuring {{that it would be}} suitable for exemption. The [...] "E" [...] symbol has no legal standing itself, and local <b>Trading</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>officers</b> may confiscate material bearing a distributor-applied [...] "E" [...] symbol if they believe that it is not exempt. The distributor may then be subject to prosecution under the Video Recordings Act 2010.|$|R
50|$|On 1 January 1996 the European Directive No. 89/336/EEC (known as the EMC Directive) {{came into}} force from the European Union. This meant that all {{electronic}} equipment sold {{had to be}} tested {{to make sure it}} did not emit excessive electromagnetic interference. If the product passed the test it was issued with the CE mark. <b>Trading</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>officers</b> could fine a company £5,000 that did not have a CE mark on an electronic product. The CE mark was originally going to be needed for electronic equipment from January 1992, and from January 1993 the DTI spent £450,000 informing companies about the change in legislation, spending another £100,000 after January 1996. The legislation was passed in early 1992.|$|R
40|$|This paper explores {{fraudulent}} acts by {{offenders who}} target and pressurize older adults ‘on the doorstep’ to have property repairs, often misrepresenting themselves as skilled tradesmen, and overcharging for such work.

Using Reiner’s (2000) Necessary Conditions of Crime framework illustrates {{the dynamics of}} doorstep fraud – from ‘low-value’ crimes to incidents of grooming and repeated victimization to the actions of organized crime groups often involving money laundering. The paper’s contribution is a focus on a relatively understudied but vulnerable demographic group in criminology, and in highlighting the investigation practices of non-constabulary law enforcement officers {{who have not been}} the subject of empirical study in criminolog...|$|R
5000|$|Morgan {{and others}} began documenting sellers of MMS and {{reporting}} {{them to the}} relevant authorities in Britain, and he eventually addressed a public meeting of the Cardiff Council to win the backing of <b>trading</b> <b>standards</b> <b>officers</b> to highlight the dangers of MMS. These efforts eventually led the Food Standards Agency (FSA) to issue a warning across the European Union and put United Kingdom councils on alert over retail sales of MMS. FSA representative Hefin Davies said that Morgan's actions had been [...] "very positive" [...] in bringing the issue {{to the attention of}} authorities. He recounted his saga with MMS on the BBC's The One Show, and on podcasts such as The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe, Righteous Indignation, and Token Skeptic.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the launch, {{an article}} in The Grocer trade {{magazine}} had mentioned {{that the source of}} the Dasani brand water was in fact treated tap water from Sidcup, a suburban town on the outskirts of Greater London. By early March 2004, the mainstream press had picked up the story and it became widely reported that Sidcup tap water, after being processed by reverse osmosis, had been remineralized, bottled and sold under the Dasani brand name in the UK. Although Coca-Cola never implied that the water was being sourced from a spring or other natural source, they marketed it as being especially [...] "pure". This led the Food Standards Agency to request Hillingdon <b>trading</b> <b>standards</b> <b>officers</b> to launch an investigation into whether the claim was accurate.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, Food Standards Australia New Zealand {{published}} an official shoppers' guidance {{with which the}} concerns of food additives and their labeling are mediated. [...] In the EU it can take 10 years or more to obtain approval for a new food additive. This includes five years of safety testing, followed by two years for evaluation by the European Food Safety Authority and another three years before the additive receives an EU-wide approval for use in {{every country in the}} European Union. Apart from testing and analyzing food products during the whole production process to ensure safety and compliance with regulatory <b>standards,</b> <b>Trading</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>officers</b> (in the UK) protect the public from any illegal use or potentially dangerous mis-use of food additives by performing random testing of food products.|$|R
50|$|Distraction {{burglary}} {{is different}} to more common random burglary, and is rarer but often more upsetting {{because it involves}} more dedicated and skilful felons. The ruthless individuals perpetrating this crime usually target properties {{around the edge of}} Oxford near the ring road, and tend to come from outside the area. Household scams, of a ruthless and targeted similar nature, usually involved elderly people who they would be cajoled into paying astronomical prices for unnecessary repair work done on their property. The rogue traders involved were difficult to trace by county council <b>Trading</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>officers.</b> An elderly couple were conned into paying for minor repairs with their entire life savings. Online scams were more prevalent than perhaps realised, with up to £20bn of online fraud committed a year. It was investigated by the e-commerce unit of SOCA. Richard Cox of The Spamhaus Project was interviewed about internet crime.|$|R

5000|$|Basa {{has become}} {{common in the}} UK as [...] "Vietnamese river cobbler", [...] "river cobbler", or [...] "basa". It is mainly sold by large supermarkets, in both fresh and frozen forms, as a more {{reasonably}} priced alternative to popular white fish such as cod or haddock.

40|$|Purpose The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to explore the}} views of <b>Trading</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>Officers</b> on the Government’s plans to reform the Consumer Protection Landscape. It aimed to identify their attitudes towards the plans and if they anticipate any difficulties. Methodology The researcher used a quantitative method {{in the form of}} a web-based survey to gain a broad view of the topic. Data was gathered from staff within <b>Trading</b> <b>Standards</b> in Scotland. Findings The main findings highlighted staff’s uncertainties towards the proposals. A lot of negativity towards the changes arose in the results with respondents feeling a more effective review of consumer protection was needed. It emerged that two thirds of respondents were unsure as to whether or not their local authority would accept the proposed changes. A main concern was the cuts to funding and how an effective service to consumers could be delivered under a reduced budget Originality/value This is such a current topic as the proposals were first introduced in June 2011. Consumer Organisations have released responses to these proposals, however, no research has been carried out to consider staff at the front line of consumer protection and their attitudes toward the changes...|$|R
5000|$|In Europe toys {{must meet}} the {{criteria}} set by the EC Toy Safety Directive (essentially that a toy be safe, which may be addressed by testing to European Standard EN71) {{in order for them}} to carry the CE mark. All European Union member states have transposed this directive into law - for example, the UK's Toy (Safety) Regulations 1995. [...] <b>Trading</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>Officers</b> in the UK, similarly to appropriate authorities in the other EU member states, have the power to immediately demand the withdrawal of a toy product from sale on safety grounds via the RAPEX recall notification system (used for all products subject to European safety legislation). [...] In Canada the government department Health Canada has the responsibility of ensuring product safety, just as the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) does in the United States. Australian and New Zealand toy safety standards (following the approximate model of the European Toy Safety Standard) have been adopted by the ISO as International Standard ISO 8124. Toy safety standards are continually updated and modified as the understanding of risks increases and new products are developed.|$|R
40|$|This {{briefing}} {{is part of}} {{a series}} explaining the difficulties involved in growing GM and non-GM crops together (‘co-existence’), and why a strong legal framework is needed to deal with this issue. Under European law, Member States can create a legal basis for coexistence and liability, and the UK Government has now started this process. It is vital that strict laws are put into place to prevent contamination of non-GM crops and ensure that biotechnology companies are held liable for any damage caused by their products. Local and regional authorities should have the democratic right {{to decide whether or not}} GM crops are grown in their areas. Key points? Numerous cases of GM contamination of food have already occurred worldwide? Local <b>Trading</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>Officers</b> are responsible for enforcing GM labelling rules, but have insufficient funding to do this effectively? The UK food industry is already using the limit of detection as their threshold for GM contamination – this must be allowed to continue? A levy on GM crops would provide sufficient funding to enable effective monitoring of GM contamination to be carried out Contamination incidents GM crops have been commercially grown in the USA since 1996, and there have already been numerous well documented cases of GM contamination of food for domestic use and export...|$|R

5000|$|A {{legal case}} in the English Criminal Courts has held that a {{grapefruit}} knife is, in fact, a knife. It is illegal under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 to sell knives to persons under 18. <b>Trading</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>officers</b> of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead brought charges in East Berkshire Magistrates' Court against W J Daniel and Company Limited, one of whose employees had sold a grapefruit knife to a test purchaser {{under the age of}} 16 on 17 February 2009. The magistrates were persuaded that it was not, in fact, a knife but a [...] "gadget" [...] and duly dismissed the case. At an appeal in the High Court, Sir Anthony May found that this was wrong. Using the definition of [...] "knife" [...] in the Oxford English Dictionary ("A cutting instrument consisting of a blade with a sharpened longitudinal edge fixed in a handle either rigidly, as in a table knife, carving or sheath knife, or with a joint, as in a pocket or clasp knife. The blade is generally of steel, but sometimes of other material, as in the silver fish and fruit knives, the blunt edged paper knife of ivory, wood, etcetera, and the flint knives of early man.") which, he said, accorded with his own understanding, he ruled that a grapefruit knife was indeed a knife within the meaning of the Act and upheld the appeal. The case was remitted to the magistrates to continue the hearing.|$|R
40|$|New Approach’ Directives now {{govern the}} health and safety of most {{products}} whether destined for workplace or domestic use. These Directives have been enacted into UK law by various specific legislation principally relating to work equipment, machinery and consumer products. This research investigates whether the risk assessment approach used to ensure the safety of machinery may be applied to consumer products. Crucially, consumer products are subject to the Consumer Protection Act (CPA) 1987, where there is no direct reference to “assessing risk”. This contrasts with the law governing the safety of products used in the workplace, where risk assessment underpins the approach. New Approach Directives are supported by European harmonised standards, and in the case of machinery, further supported by the risk assessment standard, EN 1050. The system regulating consumer product safety is discussed, its key elements identified and a graphical model produced. This model incorporates such matters as conformity assessment, the system of regulation, near miss and accident reporting. A key finding of the research is that New Approach Directives have a common feature of specifying essential performance requirements that provide a hazard prompt-list that can form the basis for a risk assessment (the hazard identification stage). Drawing upon 272 prosecution cases, and with thirty examples examined in detail, this research provides evidence that despite the high degree of regulation, unsafe consumer products still find their way onto the market. The research presents a number of risk assessment tools to help <b>Trading</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>Officers</b> (TSOs) prioritise their work at the initial inspection stage when dealing with subsequent enforcement action...|$|R
