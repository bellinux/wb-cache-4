5|$|A {{country with}} a large trade surplus would {{generally}} see {{the value of its}} currency appreciate relative to other currencies, which would reduce the imbalance as the relative price of its exports increases. This currency appreciation occurs as the importing country sells its currency to buy the exporting country's currency used to purchase the goods. Alternatively, trade imbalances can be reduced if a country encouraged domestic saving by restricting or penalising the flow of capital across borders, or by raising interest rates, although this benefit is likely offset by slowing down <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> increasing government interest payments.|$|E

Amin sent troops against the mutineers, some of whom had fled across the Tanzanian border. Amin accused Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere of waging war against Uganda, ordered the invasion of Tanzanian territory, and formally annexed a section of the Kagera Region across the boundary.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} {{financial}} crisis {{as an opportunity to}} examine a number of key questions about the relationship of <b>the</b> creative <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> city. We argue that weak conceptualisation {{of the nature of the}} relationship between <b>the</b> creative <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> city, as well as a lack of clarity about what <b>the</b> creative <b>economy</b> is, has subverted debates about this important topic. This paper comprises four major sections: the first introduces the field of <b>the</b> creative <b>economy,</b> <b>the</b> second section seeks to clarify what exactly we mean by the term financial crisis; here we highlight the multifaceted character of {{the financial crisis}} and is variable impacts across the field of <b>the</b> creative <b>economy.</b> <b>The</b> third part outlines the range and diversity of the actually existing relations between <b>the</b> creative <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> city.
