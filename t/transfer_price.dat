This record (in pound sterling) had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kaká from Milan for €67m (£65million).

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the empirical literature on the <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> behavior of multinational firms. Previous research mainly focuses on <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> {{as a means of}} tax optimization. Our approach concentrates on <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> as a critical compliance issue. Specifically, we investigate whether and to what extent the awareness of <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> as a tax compliance issue responds to country and industry characteristics as well as firm-specifics. Empirically, the <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> risk awareness is measured as a professional assessment reported by the person with ultimate responsibility for <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> in their company. Based on a unique global survey conducted by a Big 4 accounting firm in 2007 and 2008, we estimate the number of firms reporting <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> being the largest risk issue with regard to subsequent tax payments. We find that <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> risk awareness depends on variables accounting for general tax and <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> specific strategies, the types and characteristics of intercompany transactions the multinational firms are involved in, their individual <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> compliance efforts and resources dedicated to <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> matters. <b>Transfer</b> pricing; international taxation; multinational firms; tax risk management...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to explore the issue of enterprise's <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> which has been noticed by tax administrations of many nations in recent years. The academia has also striven to develop models for {{interpreting}} <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> and assessing <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> profit of enterprises. A precise model is applied in this study to interpret enterprise's <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> in practice. Furthermore, this model is also used to assess the <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> profit of listing/OTC electronics companies in Taiwan and study the factors affecting <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> profit. The empirical results show that material expense ratio significantly impacts <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> profit. Corporate income tax expenses are positively and significantly correlated with net incomes of corporate <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> transactions. This study also finds that regardless of whether the net income of corporate <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> transactions is high, medium, or low, the proportion of material costs is positively and significantly correlated with the net income of corporate <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> transactions in all scenarios. Higher profit will be affected by exchange rate. This suggests that companies involved in wafer fabrication, IC packaging and testing, and DRAM packaging and testing (subcontractors with relatively low material costs) are less likely to be involved in <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> decisions. <b>Transfer</b> <b>pricing,</b> quantile regression, net income model, F 23...|$|R

We conclude that the economic <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> research has certainly improved the understanding of the relative usefulness of alternative <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> methods for a carefully selected set of assumptions.

40|$|The <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing,</b> {{literature}} {{indicates that}} {{an investigation of}} some aspects of this subject could usefully be undertaken in order {{to contribute to the}} understanding of <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> in both domestic and international markets. This study aims at exploring the current state of <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> practice and establishing the importance attached to the ranking of <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> determinants (i. e. objectives and environmental variables) {{and the extent to which}} the ranking varies across markets, industry, and according to the <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> method used. It also seeks to discover interrelationship among the <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> determinants in order to produce a reduced set of basic factors. Lastly, it aims at evaluating the relationship between <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> determinants and <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> methods and at discovering a means of predicting the latter from the company's perception of the relative importance of these determinants. To achieve the above objectives, an empirical study covering both domestic and international markets was undertaken in UK companies. The conclusions are concerned with <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> policy, methods currently used, and problems apparent in practice. The overall ranking-by survey respondents of the <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> determinants is given as well as the results of tests of certain hypotheses which relate to this ranking. The <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> determinants used in the survey for domestic and international. markets (twelve and twenty respectively) have been reduced by Factor Analysis to four and six factors. The study made use of the results to obtain measures of the ranking of discovered factors. Finally, the relationship between the <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> determinants and <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> methods was quantitatively evaluated in the form of a set of classification functions by using Multi-Discriminant Analysis. The classification functions are able to predict the <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> method actually used in companies with an acceptable degree of success.
