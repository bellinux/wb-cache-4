5000|$|During another {{interview}} at E3 2009, game director Dan Greenwalt {{revealed that the}} updated physics engine would include tire deformation, {{and the ability to}} flip the car over. He also included that there is a [...] "pressure" [...] system in which the A.I., depending on how the difficulty is set, would make mistakes when under pressure. In addition to improvements to the A.I. and physics, the new Photo Mode features ten times more polygons in each car model, bump mapping, and texture resolutions four times higher than before. Also, it is confirmed that the game would run at 60 frames per second. The interview also revealed that there would be several scoreboards ranging from driver scoreboards to painting and tuner leaderboards. There also would be a video editor feature available. Greenwalt stated that Project Blackjack, the team that made an E3 <b>trailer,</b> used capture <b>cards</b> to make their videos. The video editor grants players more possibilities. Players would also be able to create their own race rules but only in private matches as public matches are held through a matchmaking system that has no customization for the player. The player instead has to choose from one of the hoppers provided which are A-R class races. Unlike its predecessors, Forza Motorsport 3 doesn't support System Link.|$|R
