He adopted a lifestyle of fasting and abstention from social interaction throughout {{the production of the}} film.

5|$|Describing {{the choice}} of {{developing}} a game based on the existing White Wolf property over creating their own, Boyarsky said that although an original property lacked the constraints of an existing one, the downside was {{that it had not}} been tested and could be rejected by its potential audience; an existing property was proven. Troika <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> {{as close as possible to}} the White Wolf rules, while reducing the number of abilities and disciplines to those relevant to Bloodlines gameplay.|$|E
5|$|After his retirement, San Martín {{intended}} {{to live in}} Cuyo. Although the war of independence had ended in the region, the Argentine Civil Wars continued. The unitarians wanted to organize {{the country as a}} unitary state centered on Buenos Aires, and the federals, who preferred a federation of provinces. San Martín had good relations with the federal caudillos and a personal feud with unitarian leader Bernardino Rivadavia, but <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> neutral. San Martín's wife, María de los Remedios de Escalada, died in 1823, so he returned to Buenos Aires. He took his daughter Mercedes Tomasa, who was living with her mother's family, and sailed to Europe.|$|E

5|$|Though Disney gave Nomura {{freedom in}} the {{characters}} and worlds used for the games, {{he and his staff}} <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> within the established roles of characters and boundaries of the worlds. Nomura has stated that though many of the Disney characters are not normally dark and serious, there were not many challenges making them so for the story, and despite this, their personalities shine because they maintain their own characteristics. He also felt managing and keeping multiple worlds was problematic. When deciding which worlds to include in the game, the development staff tried to take into account worlds with Disney characters that would be interesting and made an effort to minimize any overlap in the overall look and feel of each world.|$|E
5|$|The Peninsular War in Spain, {{along with}} the capture of the king Ferdinand VII and {{the fall of the}} Junta of Seville, {{escalated}} political disputes in Buenos Aires that led to the May Revolution. Several criollos thought that the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, appointed by the fallen Junta, did not have legitimacy, and requested an open cabildo to discuss it. Azcuénaga attended it, and voted {{for the creation of a}} Junta with deputies from all the provinces, with the Cabildo ruling in the interregnum. However, the majority agreed with the creation of a junta, but with another junta of people from Buenos ruling during in the meantime. The viceroy <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in government as president of the Junta, which was resisted by the criollos. Azcuénaga lend his house to their secret meetings. Azcuénaga was appointed as a member of the new Primera Junta, and promoted to brigadier. The reasons of Azcuénaga's inclusion in the Junta are unclear, as with all its members. A common accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists, Alzaguists, the military and the clergy; besides being from the armed forces, Azcuénaga had close ties with the rich people of the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{localized}} for the West by Atlus USA. The project leader was Bill Alexander, the lead translator was Sammy Matsushima, while dialogue editing was handled by Mike Meeker. As with their other localizations such {{as for the}} Persona series, the team <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> faithful to the original text. This proved easier than for the Persona series as its fictional setting meant there were no cultural in-jokes {{that would not be}} understood outside Japan. The localization took place from 2006 to 2007: the project was an unusual one for Atlus, as it was an entirely new intellectual property from a studio that was still little known in the West. When tasked with localizing the game for Western markets, the team were told that the game had a Shakespearean feel, so Matsushima created a script that reflected that: with the concept of a play in mind, the dialogue was written to give a noble feel to the characters, in addition to fairy tale elements fitting in with its frame story of a girl reading books. For his part, Meeker read King Lear and A Midsummer Night's Dream to find the correct style for his writing, in addition to reading Beowulf to properly capture the narrative's darker elements.|$|E

25|$|The New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA), {{a public}} {{authority}} presided by New York City, {{was created in}} 1953 to take over subway, bus, and streetcar operations from the city, and placed under control of the state-level Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in 1968. Soon after the MTA {{took control of the}} subway, New York City entered a fiscal crisis. It closed many elevated subway lines that became too expensive to maintain. Graffiti and crime became common, and equipment and stations fell into decrepit condition. The New York City Subway <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> solvent, so it had to make many service cutbacks and defer necessary maintenance projects. In the 1980s an $18 billion financing program for the rehabilitation of the subway began.|$|E

25|$|Nikolai, {{initially}} {{delighted to}} have his son return home, slowly begins to feel uneasy, and a certain awkwardness in his regard, as it emerges that Arkady's views, much influenced by Bazarov, are radical and make his own beliefs feel dated. Nikolai has always <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> as current as possible, by doing things such as visiting his son at school so the two can stay as close as they are, but this in Nikolai's eyes has failed. To complicate this, the father has taken a servant, Fenechka, into his house {{to live with him}} and has already had a son by her. Arkady however is not troubled by the relationship: to the contrary, he openly celebrates the addition of a younger brother.|$|E
25|$|Juel {{had taken}} up a {{position}} between the Swedish squadron and the outlet between the German mainland and the island of Falster. After a war council on 30 May, the Swedish force decided to attempt to sail around the Danish force and set a course for east-northeast on 31 May. The wind abated once more that day and both sides began towing their ships to make headway. The Swedish force <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in formation by setting the pace by the slowest ships, and later that afternoon, the first Danish ships came within firing range. Before night fell, Drejer of Enigheden managed to overtake and capture Wrangel Palats. During the night, the wind picked up once more, which was to Juel's benefit.|$|E
25|$|Many first-round {{candidates}} {{endorsed the}} second-round candidates, but some made public statements regarding {{the second round}} but did not endorse. Dragan Primorac made several public statements - he initially <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> completely neutral, but later released one where he listed some characteristics of the future president that he would want, without naming a candidate, but focusing on the fight against corruption. The reception was mixed – Večernji list said he chose no one, while Jutarnji list said that he chose Josipović, reading between the lines. The Josipović campaign later decided to include Primorac in their endorsement list and Primorac {{did not seem to}} come forward with a public rebuttal. On the other hand, Josip Jurčević made a late public statement telling voters to void their ballot.|$|E

25|$|Bella annoys Edward with {{questions}} about how he saved her life. She hears that Edward {{and his family are}} vampires who drink animal blood. She is told legends of the local Quilyeute people by a friend Jacob Black who she met during a camp out. Disturbed by recurring nightmares, Bella researches about vampires. To her dismay, she then realizes that Edward hadn't come to school on the blood typing day because he is a vampire; she compares the characteristics of the vampires in mythology to the Cullens, and finds many similarities. Convinced he's a vampire, she finds herself in the state of bewilderment. Bella is saved by Edward again in Port Angeles when she is almost attacked. Driving a silver Volvo, Edward takes Bella to dinner and home. As they drive, she tells him of the stories that he is a vampire. Edward says he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> away, finding her scent too desirable. Over time, Edward and Bella fall in love.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War, like his native State, Buford <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> out of the Civil War and succeeded in doing so for well over a year. In September 1862, during Confederate General Braxton Bragg's invasion of Kentucky, Buford joined the Confederate States Army. He helped raise and took command of a Kentucky brigade and on September 2, 1862, was commissioned Brigadier General. Among his missions, Buford covered General Braxton Bragg's retreat from Kentucky, was part of the Vicksburg Campaign under General Loring, fought in the Battle of Champion Hill, a raid on Paducah, KY on 25 March 1864 under Maj. Gen. Nathan B. Forrest, the Battle of Brice's Crossroads and was wounded on December 24, 1864, at Richland Creek during the Battle of Nashville when he covered Lt. Gen. Hood's retreat following the Confederate Army's loss. In Alabama in February, 1865, he commanded a division in Forrest's Cavalry Corps until the surrender at Selma following Wilson's Raid.|$|E
25|$|Another option {{circulated}} {{within the}} party saw {{the balance of power}} to be held by either the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and their 25 seats or Social Credit Party of Canada with their 15 seats. St-Laurent was encouraged by others {{to reach out to the}} CCF and at least four of six independent/small party MPs to form a coalition majority government, which would have held 134 of the 265 seats in Parliament—50.1% of the total. St. Laurent, however, had no desire to stay in office; he believed that the nation had passed a verdict against his government and his party. In any case, the CCF and Socreds had pledged to cooperate with a Tory government. It was very likely that St. Laurent would have been defeated on the floor of the House had he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in power with a minority government, and would not have stayed in office for long even if he survived that confidence vote. With this in mind, St. Laurent resigned on 21 June 1957—ending the longest uninterrupted run in government for a party at the federal level in Canadian history.|$|E

25|$|Having {{broken through}} the barrier, the truck, driving in a zigzag fashion, knocked down random {{members of the}} crowd milling about on the {{pavement}} and in the three traffic lanes on the seaward side of the Promenade. The driver <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> on the pavement—returning to the traffic lanes only when blocked by a bus shelter or pavilion—thus {{increasing the number of}} deaths. After reaching the Hotel Negresco, the progress of the truck, already travelling more slowly, was further slowed down by a passing cyclist, whose attempts to open the cabin door were abandoned after being threatened with a gun through the window; followed by a motorcyclist, in pursuit from the Centre Universitaire Méditerranéen, who threw his scooter under the front wheels of the truck at the intersection with rue Meyerbeer, striking blows at the driver from the running board before being struck with the butt of the driver's gun, suffering moderate injuries from falling off the truck's side. The driver fired several shots at police from his 7.65mm firearm, close to the Hotel Negresco, as police arrived; they returned fire with their 9mm Sig Sauer handguns, gave chase to the vehicle and attempted to disable it.|$|E
25|$|The {{book does}} not limit itself to tedious records of battle because Al-Biruni found the social culture {{to be more}} important. The work {{includes}} research on {{a vast array of}} topics of Indian culture, including descriptions of their traditions and customs. Although he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> away from political and military history, Biruni did indeed record important dates and noted actual sites of where significant battles occurred. Additionally, he chronicled stories of Indian rulers and told of how they ruled over their people with their beneficial actions and acted {{in the interests of the}} nation. But, his details are brief and mostly just list rulers without referring to their real names. He did not go on about deeds that each one carried out during their reign, which keeps in line with Al-Biruni's mission to try to stay away from political histories. Al-Biruni also described the geography of India in his work. He documented different bodies of water and other natural phenomena. These descriptions are useful to today's modern historians because they are able to use Biruni's scholarship to locate certain destinations in modern-day India. Historians are able to make some matches while also concluding that certain areas seem to have disappeared and been replaced with different cities. Different forts and landmarks were able to be located, legitimizing Al-Biruni's contributions with their usefulness to even modern history and archeology.|$|E
