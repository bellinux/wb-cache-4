50|$|A {{being of}} pure energy from an {{alternate}} dimension, <b>The</b> <b>Weird</b> {{was a member}} of a race known as the Zarolatts. For years, his people had been exploited as energy sources by a cruel race known as the Macrolatts. However, for some unknown reason, <b>The</b> <b>Weird</b> did not share the docile acceptance of the rest of his race. When the Macrolatts sought to bridge the dimensional gap and attack other realms, <b>The</b> <b>Weird</b> knew he had to act. Escaping through a portal to another world, <b>The</b> <b>Weird</b> found himself on the planet Earth.|$|R

Then Mitchell and Stanley find some terrific costumes at a local shop, and offer to help the proprietor organize a Halloween parade in return for letting them use the costumes for Halloween, unaware that {{they are about to}} get caught up in <b>the</b> <b>weirdest</b> adventure of all. Because some of the people in Eerie aren't really people—and Dad's radio show might just turn out to be true.|$|E
500|$|New Times Magazine {{was much}} more {{receptive}} to the series. Although labeling it [...] "unquestionably <b>the</b> <b>weirdest</b> [...] that Lear has ever produced", New Times found that the series was not [...] "a satire of mannerisms but of attitudes". All That Glitters required that viewers watch closely {{to pick up on}} the subtleties and nuances, [...] "not so much for what the show says, but for the way that it's said".|$|E
500|$|Despite its poor {{performance}} at the American box office, Labyrinth was a success on home video and later on DVD. David Bowie told an interviewer in 1992, [...] "every Christmas a new flock of children comes {{up to me and}} says, 'Oh! you're the one who's in Labyrinth!" [...] In 1997, Jennifer Connelly said [...] "I still get recognized for Labyrinth by little girls in <b>the</b> <b>weirdest</b> places. I can't believe they still recognize me from that movie.

500|$|In three weeks, the Coens wrote {{a script}} with a title role written {{specifically}} for actor John Turturro, with whom they'd {{been working on}} Miller's Crossing. The new movie, Barton Fink, was set in a large, seemingly-abandoned hotel. This setting, which they named the Hotel Earle, was a {{driving force behind the}} story and mood of the new project. While filming their 1984 film Blood Simple in Austin, Texas, the Coens had seen a hotel which made a significant impression: [...] "We thought, 'Wow, Motel Hell.' You know, being condemned to live in <b>the</b> <b>weirdest</b> hotel in the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Lastly, Summoning {{magic was}} {{to consist of}} [...] "Call" [...] and [...] "Gate" [...] spells, the former {{summoning}} entities able to exist for a set duration of time, or until slain. Summoned creatures behaved in different manners; one type might simply defend the caster, while another worked to heal the caster {{and his or her}} allies. Gate spells opened a portal, allowing different things access to the game's world. Lead designer David Maldonado called the resulting spells [...] "generally amongst <b>the</b> <b>weirdest</b> in the game," [...] with the effect often being a combination of [...] "normal" [...] spells fired simultaneously.|$|E
500|$|Although Shields feared a {{critical}} panning, reviews of Loveless were almost unanimously favourable. [...] "An album without parallel", wrote Andrew Perry in Select. [...] "Its creative inspiration defies belief. Though 'To Here Knows When' is pretty well <b>the</b> <b>weirdest</b> {{track of the}} eleven, that glorious distortion gives a fair signal of what to expect – the unexpected. Everything you hear confounds your idea of how a pop song should be played, arranged and produced." [...] "The instrumental 'Touched' is especially startling", noted Martin Aston in Q, [...] "like a drunken fight between a syrupy Disney soundtrack and an Eastern mantra. All in all, Loveless amounts to a virtual reinvention of the guitar." ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{develops}} {{the idea of}} a fabulatory politics as intimated in several essays in which Miéville has reflected on <b>the</b> <b>weird</b> and as sketched out in our article, ‘The Radical Fantastic’, for the journal C 21 Literature (Vol. 1, No. 1, 2012). Our focus here is on readers as producers, or transmitters, of <b>the</b> <b>weird.</b> Particular attention is paid to Miéville’s ‘Afterweird’ for a recent anthology in which he paints <b>the</b> <b>weird,</b> against its etymology (Wyrd), as anti-fate: ‘The fact of <b>the</b> <b>weird</b> is <b>the</b> fact that the worldweave is ripped and unfinished’. Burrowing beneath and through <b>the</b> world, <b>the</b> <b>weird</b> constitutes an affective contagion that infects – through adjacent readings - established, ‘healthy’ fictions with ‘an infestation of burrowingness itself’. That is, a certain kind of fiction triggers a certain kind of reception which, against the ‘truth’ of the given, epidemiologically abets the world in its continuous morphic variation; ungrounded, excessive and teeming. Here, we argue, is a new twist on fabulation – reading as worming-worlding. We conclude our paper with a meditation on the reception of <b>the</b> <b>weird</b> in <b>the</b> context of contemporary societies of control...|$|R

500|$|Since its release, the game's English {{localization}} {{has found}} praise. Localization reviewer Clyde Mandelin described the Japanese-to-English conversion as [...] "top-notch for its time". Kotaku found the localization [...] "funny, clever, and evocative", and 1UP.com {{said it was}} [...] "unusually excellent" [...] for the time. IGN wrote that Nintendo was [...] "dead wrong" [...] for believing that Americans would not be interested in [...] "such a chaotic and satirical world". Critics consider the game one of <b>the</b> <b>weirdest</b> and most surreal role-playing games. Examples include using items such as the Pencil Eraser to remove pencil statues, experiencing in-game hallucinations, meeting [...] "a man who turned himself into a dungeon", and battling piles of vomit, taxi cabs, and walking nooses.|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} rest of the cast, Yelchin was allowed to choose what {{elements}} there were from their predecessor's performances. Yelchin decided to carry on Walter Koenig's speech patterns of replacing [...] "v"s with [...] "w"s, although he and Abrams felt this was a trait more common of Polish accents than Russian ones. He described Chekov as an odd character, being a Russian who was brought on to the show [...] "in the middle of the Cold War." [...] He recalled a [...] "scene where they're talking to Apollo , 'I am Apollo.' And Chekov is like, 'And I am the czar of all the Russias.' [...] They gave him these lines. I mean he really is <b>the</b> <b>weirdest,</b> weirdest character." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{received}} positively by critics. Ethan Gilsdorf of the Boston Globe stated that [...] "it’s {{fun to watch}} as Munroe tackles each question and examines every possible complication." [...] According to Gilsdorf, What If? gives a view into [...] "Munroe’s playful yet existentially-tinged worldview" [...] by contrasting cataclysmic scenarios with more heady ideas, such as examining {{the effects of a}} magnitude minus-7 Richter scale earthquake. The Huffington Post remarked that [...] "What makes Munroe's work so fantastic is a combination of two elements: his commitment to trying to answer even <b>the</b> <b>weirdest</b> question with solid science, and his undeniable sense of humor." [...] Rhett Allain of Wired praised What If? because even his 12-year-old son was able to enjoy it, though he found a minor error in one of the sections.|$|E

[...] Both <b>The</b> <b>Weird</b> and Hubert’s Arthur were collaborations with Harry Pirie-Gordon. [...] These works {{differ from the}} autobiographical novels in two respects: they are set in {{previous}} centuries, and the principal protagonist in each is not Rolfe’s alter ego, {{although there is a}} strong degree of identification.

500|$|Also seeing {{improvement}} was Jane Boursaw of AOL's TV Squad, commenting [...] "Tonight's episode definitely got me intrigued about fringe science, {{and this is}} the first time I can really say I'm looking forward to the next episode. It's a combination of things, and of course, Walter's scattered ramblings about whatever strikes him at any particular moment." [...] Less impressed was Noel Murray of The Onions A. V. Club, who gave the episode a grade of C+. Murray wrote, [...] "'The Arrival' was <b>the</b> <b>weirdest</b> episode of Fringe yet–a deep-down sci-fi spookfest that minimized the show's procedural side and instead raised far more questions than it answered. In fact, I can't think of any questions that [...] "The Arrival" [...] satisfactorily answered–not even 'What happened in the Fringe episode entitled 'The Arrival'?'... The shock and awe factor of [...] "The Arrival" [...] was strong, but as a piece of storytelling, the episode felt slight and soggy, and hardly the satisfying standalone experience that the creators promised each Fringe chapter would be." ...|$|E
500|$|Judy Berman from Flavorwire {{found the}} video [...] "a precise yet still poetic {{evocation}} of the track", while CraveOnline's Johnny Firecloud opined that [...] "In her new video for [...] "Mutual Core", Iceland's queen of bizarre takes her latest single from Biophilia and turns it into an intimate hallucinatory mingling of the elements". Chris Martins of Spin compared the video to the TV series Nova, stating that the video [...] "might be <b>the</b> <b>weirdest</b> NOVA pilot ever created", later adding that Björk [...] "reinvents herself as the freakiest geology teacher the world's ever seen", an expression used also by io9 blogger George Dvorsky, who commented that [...] "this stunning new video for [...] "Mutual Core" [...] makes us wish we had Björk for a geology teacher". Brett Warner of Ology praised the director's work stating that [...] "director Andrew Thomas Huang's gorgeous visuals will adeptly manage to both confuse {{the hell out of}} you and absolutely take your breath away". Abdullah Saeed of The Atlantic compared the video to her previous works and commented: ...|$|E
500|$|SpongeBob SquarePants is Nickelodeon's first {{original}} Saturday-morning cartoon. It first aired as {{a preview}} on May1, 1999, and officially premiered on July17. Hillenburg {{noted that the}} show's premise [...] "is that innocence prevailswhich I don't think it always does in real life." [...] It has received positive reviews from critics, and has been noted for its appeal to different age groups. James Poniewozik of the Time magazine described the titular character as [...] "the anti-Bart Simpson, temperamentally and physically: his head is as squared-off and neat as Bart's is unruly, {{and he has a}} personality to matchconscientious, optimistic and blind to the faults in the world and those around him." [...] On the other hand, The New York Times critic Joyce Millman said that the show [...] "is clever without being impenetrable to young viewers and goofy without boring grown-ups to tears. It's the most charming toon on television, and one of <b>the</b> <b>weirdest.</b> ...Like Pee-wee's Playhouse, SpongeBob joyfully dances on the fine line between childhood and adulthood, guilelessness and camp, the warped and the sweet." ...|$|E
40|$|This short video {{essay was}} {{presented}} at Glasgow Buzzcut Symposium 'Side Burns' on Wednesday 5 th April 2017. It is called <b>The</b> <b>Weird</b> World of Donald Trump. It argues how America’s current encounter {{with the world of}} Donald Trump is akin to <b>the</b> <b>weird</b> realism of H. P Lovecraft, drawing upon Mark Fisher’s account of <b>the</b> <b>weird</b> - defined by Lovecraft’s fiction - as an encounter that can encompass grotesque sensations of fear when experiencing an object or being that shape shifts and transforms itself. <b>The</b> <b>weird,</b> in this sense challenges and creeps into the perceived safety and certainty of everyday life to frightening political effect. The essay presents a short reading of Trump’s world against the philosophy of Lovecraft’s weird as a way of thinking about how the encounter with it might be understood and challenged. If a community can find a language to describe the sensation of what they are experiencing then there is hope that it can be collectively overcome, claiming a space within <b>the</b> <b>weird,</b> facing up to the thing on the doorstep...|$|R

500|$|As he was {{developing}} the show's concept, Hillenburg remembered his teaching {{experience at the}} Orange County Marine Institute and how mesmerized children were by tide-pool animals, including crabs, octopuses, starfish, and sponges. It came {{to him that the}} series should take place underwater, with a focus on those creatures: [...] "I wanted to create a small town underwater where the characters were more like us than like fish. They have fire. They take walks. They drive. They have pets and holidays." [...] It suited what Hillenburg liked for a show, [...] "something that was fantastic but believable." [...] He also wanted his series to stand out from most popular cartoons of the time exemplified by buddy comedies such as The Ren & Stimpy Show (19911995). As a result, he decided to focus on one main character: <b>the</b> <b>weirdest</b> sea creature that he could think of. This led him to the sponge: [...] "I wanted to do a show about a character that was an innocent, and so I focused on a sea sponge because it's a funny animal, a strange one." [...] In 1994, Hillenburg began to further develop some characters from The Intertidal Zone, including Bob the Sponge.|$|E
500|$|Martin Olson, one of {{the writers}} for Rocko's Modern Life, read The Intertidal Zone and {{encouraged}} Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, Hillenburg had not even considered creating his own series. However, he realized that if he ever did, {{this would be the}} best approach. He began to further develop some of the characters from The Intertidal Zone, including the comic's [...] "announcer", Bob the Sponge. He wanted his series to stand out from most popular cartoons of the time, which he felt were exemplified by buddy comedies such as The Ren & Stimpy Show. As a result, Hillenburg decided to focus on one main character: <b>the</b> <b>weirdest</b> sea creature that he could think of. This led him to the sponge. The Intertidal Zones Bob the Sponge resembles an actual sea sponge, and at first Hillenburg continued to utilize this design. In determining the new character's personality, Hillenburg drew inspiration from innocent, childlike figures that he enjoyed, such as Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, Jerry Lewis, and Pee-wee Herman. He then considered modeling the character after a kitchen sponge and realized that this idea would perfectly match the character's square personality.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} 1974. The budget was $1.5 million. Pre-production lasted one week, including casting. Grittier sequences were {{shot on the}} streets of New York City, while less serious locations were shot on Warner Bros.' sound stages in Los Angeles. According to Bakshi, [...] "What I would do is dress guys up, live-action guys. Very strange dudes! <b>The</b> <b>weirdest</b> guys I could find. Having them talk to animated characters in front of candy stores, discussing girlfriends and such. It was very surrealistic." [...] Yaphet Kotto and the glam punk band New York Dolls were cast in the live action sequences, with the New York Dolls playing homosexuals. Mean Streets actors Richard Romanus and David Proval were cast as the voices of Vinnie and Crazy Shapiro. Much of the shooting of live action sequences and recording of animated dialogue involved improvisation, with Bakshi setting up the premise of the scene and allowing his actors to create their own dialogue. During the [...] "rumble" [...] sequence, the actors playing the Chaplains were filmed popping and performing styles of dance which later evolved into breakdancing, dance styles which were unheard of in the 1970s studio system.|$|E
