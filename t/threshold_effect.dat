It is volatile, so the primary exposure is via inhalation as against food or water with occupational hazards being highest. Prior to 1974, workers were commonly exposed to 1,000 ppm vinyl chloride, causing [...] "vinyl chloride illness" [...] such as acroosteolysis and Raynaud's Phenomenon. The symptoms of vinyl chloride exposure are classified by ppm levels in ambient air with 4,000 ppm having a <b>threshold</b> <b>effect.</b> The intensity of symptoms varies from acute (1,000-8,000 ppm), including dizziness, nausea, visual disturbances, headache, and ataxia, to chronic (above 12,000 ppm), including narcotic effect, cardiac arrhythmias, and fatal respiratory failure. RADS (Reactive Airway Dysfunction Syndrome) may be caused by acute exposure to vinyl chloride.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this article}} we analyze how the {{presence}} of thresholds influences multi agent decision making situations. We introduce a class of discounted autonomous optimal control problems with <b>threshold</b> <b>effects</b> and discuss tools to analyze these problems. Later, using these results we investigate two types of threshold effects; namely, simple and hysteresis switching, in the canonical model of the shallow lake. We solve the optimal management and open loop Nash equilibrium solutions for the shallow lake model with <b>threshold</b> <b>effects.</b> We establish a bifurcation analysis of the optimal vector field. Further, we observe that modeling with <b>threshold</b> <b>effects</b> simplifies this analysis. To be precise, the bifurcation scenarios rely on simple rules (inequalities) which can be verified easily. However, the qualitative behavior of the switching vector field {{is similar to the}} smooth case. ...|$|R

The parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood based on the extended Kalman filter and uses numerical integration over the latent volatility process. The stochastic volatility model with only correlation does {{a better job of}} capturing asymmetry than a threshold stochastic volatility model even though it has fewer parameters. We develop a stochastic volatility model that includes both <b>threshold</b> <b>effects</b> and correlated innovations. We find that the general model with both <b>threshold</b> <b>effects</b> and correlated innovations dominates purely threshold and correlated models. In this augmented model volatility and returns are negatively correlated, and volatility is more persistent, less volatile and higher following negative returns even after counting for the negative correlation. ...|$|R

The threshold testing procedure developed by Hansen (1999) provides a framework for testing the effects of key variables relating to capital mobility {{in conjunction with the}} saving-investment relationship. Ho (2003) first applied this method to the saving-investment puzzle controlling for thresholds in country size. Extending this model, this paper reports a number of significant <b>thresholds</b> <b>effects</b> for country- size, trade and financial openness measures, age dependency ratios and trade balances. After controlling for <b>threshold</b> <b>effects</b> the relationship between savings and investment is found to be statistically insignificant. Additionally, controlling for the <b>thresholds</b> <b>effects</b> in a dynamic model of the current account allows for direct comparison between the savings-investment coefficient and adjustments to a country’s external balance. ...|$|R
