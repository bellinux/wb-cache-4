The 2013 <b>Torture</b> <b>and</b> Custodial Death (Prevention) Act was poorly enforced {{due to a lack of}} political will and awareness among law enforcement agencies. Human rights groups accused several security force branches - including police and the Rapid Action Battalion - of <b>torture</b> <b>and</b> other ill-treatment. <b>Torture</b> was carried out to extract “confessions”, for extortion or to punish political opponents of the government.|$|R

5|$|Recording {{sessions}} for The Joshua Tree began in January 1986 in Danesmoate House in Dublin and continued throughout the year. U2 briefly interrupted these sessions in June to join Amnesty International's A Conspiracy of Hope tour of benefit concerts. Following the first concert in San Francisco, lead singer Bono met René Castro, a Chilean mural artist. Castro had been <b>tortured</b> <b>and</b> {{held in a}} concentration camp for two years by the dictatorial Chilean government because his artwork criticised the Pinochet-led regime that seized power in 1973 during a coup d'état. Castro showed Bono a wall painting in the Mission District that depicted the ongoing plight in Chile and Argentina. He also learned of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo, {{a group of women}} whose children were forcibly disappeared by the Argentine government. The Madres' children were students who had opposed the government during the Dirty War, and the coup d'état that brought Jorge Rafael Videla to power. The Madres joined together to campaign for information regarding the locations of their children's bodies and the circumstances of their deaths, believing them to have been kidnapped, <b>tortured,</b> <b>and</b> murdered.|$|E

Rodrigues repudiates him, but Ferreira is implacable. That night in his prison cell, Rodrigues hears five Christians being tortured. Ferreira tells him that they have already apostatized; it is his apostasy the Japanese demand. As Rodrigues looks upon a fumi-e, he hears an inner voice of Christ giving him permission to step on it, and he does.|$|E

5|$|Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1833 {{and now in}} Tate Britain. Intended to illustrate the virtues of honour and chastity, it depicts a scene from Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene in which the female warrior Britomart slays the evil magician Busirane and frees his captive, the beautiful Amoret. In Spenser's original poem Amoret has been <b>tortured</b> <b>and</b> mutilated {{by the time of}} her rescue, but Etty disliked the depiction of violence and portrayed her as unharmed.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{scenes in}} Cannibal Holocaust {{have also been}} noted as being similar to scenes in Antonio Climati's Mondo film Savana violenta, {{specifically}} the scene in which Monroe bathes naked in {{the river and the}} scene of the forced abortion rite. The cinéma vérité style used heavily in Cannibal Holocaust was also used before in Climati's first Mondo film, Ultime grida dalla savana, in a scene where a tourist is attacked and killed by a pride of lions. Another scene, in which a native man is captured, <b>tortured,</b> <b>and</b> murdered by mercenaries in South America, uses a similar filming style, and both scenes may have been influential on Deodato's direction.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 28 April 2012, Martínez Pérez was murdered inside her home in Xalapa after being {{severely}} beaten. A suspect was arrested in October 2012 and publicly confessed to the murder, while the Mexican authorities concluded that the motive of the murder was theft. But the suspect later retracted his confession and stated that he had been <b>tortured</b> <b>and</b> threatened by officials to lie and admit to the murder. Investigators have relied solely on the suspect's confession to incriminate him; the DNA and fingerprint samples collected at the murder scene did not match the suspect's according to sources close to Committee to Protect Journalists.|$|E
5|$|Following Samuel Aba's death, Emperor Henry entered Székesfehérvár and {{restored}} Peter. Peter introduced Bavarian law in his realm, {{which suggests that}} Hungary became an imperial fief. He accepted the Emperor's suzerainty on Whitsun 1045, giving his royal lance to his overlord (who returned to Hungary). A number of plots to overthrow Peter indicate that he remained unpopular. Two of King Stephen I's maternal cousins (Bolya and Bonyha) conspired against Peter in 1045, but the King had them arrested, <b>tortured</b> <b>and</b> executed. Bishop Gerard of Csanád invited Vazul's exiled sons to the country. An uprising by pagan commoners ended Peter's second rule in 1046.|$|E

5|$|From {{as early}} as the Preclassic period, the ruler of a Maya polity was {{expected}} to be a distinguished war leader, and was depicted with trophy heads hanging from his belt.

Right up {{to the end of the}} Postclassic period, Maya kings led as war captains. Maya inscriptions from the Classic show that a defeated king could be captured, <b>tortured,</b> <b>and</b> sacrificed. The Spanish recorded that Maya leaders kept track of troop movements in painted books.|$|E
5|$|Lynching was {{a terrifying}} and {{relatively}} uncommon spectacle.

By the next morning, there were several breakthroughs in the investigation: the body had been successfully identified as 28-year-old Dora Lange; an autopsy revealed she had been strangled, <b>tortured,</b> <b>and</b> possibly raped; and early toxicology reports found traces of lysergic acid and methamphetamine in her bloodstream.
