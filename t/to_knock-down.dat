40|$|The peptidyl-prolyl {{isomerase}} cyclophilin A (CypA) embraces an exposed, proline-rich loop on HIV- 1 capsid (CA) and renders {{reverse transcription}} complexes resistant to an antiviral activity in human cells. A CypA fusion with TRIM 5 that {{is unique to}} New World owl monkeys also targets HIV- 1 CA, but this interaction potently inhibits infection. A similar block to HIV- 1 infection in Old World monkeys is attributable to the α isoform of the TRIM 5 orthologue in these species. To determine whether HIV- 1 restriction by Old World monkey TRIM 5 α is modulated by the CA-CypA interaction, RNA interference was used to disrupt CypA in cells from African green monkeys and rhesus macaques. HIV- 1 infectivity increased in response <b>to</b> CypA <b>knock-down</b> <b>to</b> the same extent that it increased in response <b>to</b> TRIM 5 <b>knock-down.</b> CypA knock-down eliminated the HIV- 1 stimulatory effect of cyclosporin A (CsA), a competitive inhibitor of the CypA-CA interaction, or of CA mutants that block binding to CypA but caused no change in titer of retroviruses that don't interact with CypA. Simultaneous knock-down of both CypA and TRIM 5 caused minimal additional increase in titer, suggesting that CypA inhibits HIV- 1 replication in these cells because it is required for CA recognition by TRIM 5 α. Finally, CsA increased HIV- 1 titer in otherwise nonrestrictive feline cells but only after these cells were transduced with Old World monkey TRIM 5 α.

40|$|The {{specific}} down-regulation of {{gene expression}} in cells {{is a powerful}} method for elucidating a gene's function. A common method for suppressing gene expression is the elimination of mRNA by RNAi or antisense. Alternatively, oligonucleotide-derived aptamers {{have been used as}} protein-directed agents for the specific knock-down of both intracellular and extracellular protein activity. Protein-directed methods offer the advantage of more closely mimicking small molecule therapeutics' mechanism of activity. Furthermore, protein-directed methods may synergize with RNA-directed methods since the two methods attack gene expression at different levels. Here we have knocked down a well-characterized intracellular protein's activity, NFκB, by expressing either aptamers or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Both methods can diminish NFκB's activity to similar levels (from 29 to 64 %). Interestingly, expression of both aptamers and siRNAs simultaneously, suppressed NFκB activity better than either method alone (up to 90 %). These results demonstrate that the expression of intracellular aptamers is a viable alternative <b>to</b> siRNA <b>knock-down.</b> Furthermore, for the first time, we show that the use of aptamers and siRNA together can be the most effective way <b>to</b> achieve maximal <b>knock-down</b> of protein activity...|$|R

With a dissociation constant < 2 nM, the interaction between Zn-DIGP and c-Myc G-quadruplex DNA is the highest affinity G-quadruplex – small molecule binding interaction reported to date.

The cellular uptake and localization of Zn-DIGP was different from duplex DNA probes like Hoechst 33342, and at relatively low doses (1 uM) it caused a rapid 3 -fold knock-down of c-MYC mRNA in neuroblastoma cells. The exact mechanism responsible for this knock-down is still under investigation, but our results are consistent with quadruplex-mediated promoter deactivation.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} underlying enhancer-blocking by insulators is unclear. We {{explored the}} activity of human β-globin HS 5, the orthologue of the CTCF-dependent chicken HS 4 insulator. An extra copy of HS 5 placed between the β-globin locus control region (LCR) and downstream genes on a transgene fulfills the classic predictions for an enhancer-blocker. Ectopic HS 5 does not perturb the LCR but blocks gene activation by interfering with RNA pol II, activator and coactivator recruitment, and epigenetic modification at the downstream β-globin gene. Underlying these effects, ectopic HS 5 disrupts chromatin loop formation between β-globin and the LCR, and instead forms a new loop with endogenous HS 5 that topologically isolates the LCR. Both enhancer-blocking and insulator-loop formation depend on an intact CTCF site in ectopic HS 5 and are sensitive <b>to</b> <b>knock-down</b> of the CTCF protein by siRNA. Thus, intrinsic looping activity of CTCF sites can nullify LCR function...|$|E

Pharmacological inhibition of NOS decreased both nitric oxide (NO) levels in the gut wall and survival of orally infected insects, whereas elevation of gut wall NO using an NO donor increased survival of NOS silenced caterpillars.

40|$|GATA- 6 is {{expressed}} in presumptive cardiac mesoderm before gastrulation, but its role in heart development has been unclear. Here we show that Xenopus and zebrafish embryos, injected with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides designed specifically <b>to</b> <b>knock-down</b> translation of GATA- 6 protein, are severely compromised for heart development. Injected embryos express greatly reduced levels of contractile machinery genes and, at the same stage, of regulatory genes such as bone morphogenetic protein- 4 (BMP- 4) and the Nkx 2 family. In contrast, initial BMP and Nkx 2 expression is normal, suggesting a maintenance role for GATA- 6. Endoderm is critical for heart formation in several vertebrates including Xenopus, and separate perturbation of GATA- 6 expression in the deep anterior endoderm and in the overlying heart mesoderm shows that GATA- 6 is required in both for cardiogenesis. The GATA- 6 requirement in cardiac mesoderm was confirmed in zebrafish, an organism in which endoderm is thought not to be necessary for heart formation. We therefore conclude that proper maturation of cardiac mesoderm requires GATA- 6, which functions to maintain BMP- 4 and Nkx 2 expression...|$|E
