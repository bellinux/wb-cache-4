5|$|Although Cuban iguanas {{typically}} remain {{still for}} long periods of time and have a slow lumbering gait due to their body mass, they are capable of quick bursts of speed for short distances. Younger animals are more arboreal and will seek refuge in trees, which they can climb with great agility. <b>The</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> a capable swimmer and will take to nearby water if threatened. When cornered they can bite and lash their tails in defense.|$|E
5|$|As a {{side effect}} of the {{electrochemical}} processes used by neurons for signaling, brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active. When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity, the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull, using electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG). EEG recordings, along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats, show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active, even during sleep. Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity, which may vary according to behavioral state. In mammals, the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep, faster alpha waves when <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> awake but inattentive, and chaotic-looking irregular activity when <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> actively engaged in a task. During an epileptic seizure, the brain's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels, producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain. Relating these population-level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster {{is prone}} to genetic {{abnormalities}} in the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids. They can develop tumours of the mammary glands, lungs, uterus, and ovaries. Tumours can also develop if <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> exposed to chemical carcinogens. Due to having slow locomotion and an insignificant response to bright lights and humans, as well as having a low population density, field studies allow scientists to study entire populations in the wild.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the name}} fisher, <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> {{not known to}} eat fish. The name is instead related to the word fitch, meaning a European polecat (Mustela putorius) or pelt thereof, due to the {{resemblance}} to that animal. The name comes from colonial Dutch equivalent fisse or visse. In the French language, the pelt of a polecat is also called fiche or fichet.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses have {{a closed}} circulatory system, where the blood remains inside blood vessels. Octopuses have three hearts; a {{systemic}} heart that circulates blood round {{the body and}} two branchial hearts that pump it through {{each of the two}} gills. The systemic heart is inactive when <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> swimming and thus it tires quickly and prefers to crawl.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources) {{lists the}} serval as least concern; <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> also {{included}} in CITES Appendix II. A major threat {{to the survival of}} the serval include the degradation of wetlands and grasslands. Trade of serval skins, though on the decline, still occurs in countries such as Benin and Senegal. In western Africa, the serval has significance in traditional medicine. Pastoralists often kill servals to protect their animals, though servals generally do not prey upon livestock.|$|E

5|$|The {{heart of}} a Whippet is large and slow beating, often being arrhythmic or even {{intermittent}} when <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> at rest. This sometimes causes concern to the owner, or to the vet not experienced with the breed. Whippets will, however, demonstrate a regular heartbeat during exercise. In a health survey conducted by The Kennel Club cardiac problems were shown to be the second leading cause of mortality in Whippets.|$|E
5|$|The longest {{documented}} {{giant otter}} lifespan {{in the wild}} is eight years.

50|$|American Humane {{certifies}} farms after evaluating {{them on a}} five point criteria. The criteria {{demands that}} <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> free from hunger, discomfort, pain, and fear, and that <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> able to express normal behaviors. Farms that meet this criteria receive an American Humane Certified label.|$|R
5|$|The ratings also do {{not reflect}} state-specific {{population}} conditions. For instance, for the Texas horned lizard, much of eastern Texas has lost the animal. Nevertheless, based on healthy populations {{in other parts of}} the West, especially New Mexico, the IUCN rates the animal Least Concern. For the timber rattlesnake (West Virginia), the IUCN notes the animal as losing range in many parts of the northeastern U.S., but because <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> numerous in the southern Appalachians, it is also Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Aside from humans, {{octopuses}} may be preyed on by fishes, seabirds, sea otters, pinnipeds, cetaceans, {{and other}} cephalopods. Octopuses typically hide or disguise themselves by camouflage and mimicry; some have conspicuous warning coloration (aposematism) or deimatic behavior. An octopus may spend 40% {{of its time}} hidden away in its den. When the octopus is approached, it may extend an arm to investigate. 66% of Enteroctopus dolfleini in one study had scars, with 50% having amputated arms. The blue rings of the highly venomous blue-ringed octopus are hidden in muscular skin folds which contract when <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> threatened, exposing the iridescent warning. The Atlantic white-spotted octopus (Callistoctopus macropus) turns bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. Displays are often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web {{to make it look}} as big and threatening as possible.|$|E
5|$|Bats are {{the only}} mammals that can truly fly. They fly through the air at a {{constant}} speed by moving their wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well). Because <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of the wings, generates a faster airflow moving over the wing. This generates a lift force vector pointing forwards and upwards, and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and upwards. The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping {{the body in the}} air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole.|$|E

40|$|Summary. Responses were {{recorded}} from isolated neurons {{in the visual}} cortex of rhesus monkeys while they performed an orientation match to sample task. In each trial <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> first cued with randomly selected orientation, and then presented with a sequence of gratings whose orientations <b>were</b> randomly selected. <b>The</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> required to release a switch when it saw a grating that matched the cued orientation. For some recordings <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> given a tactile cue by having it feel the orientation of a grooved plate {{that it could not}} see. In other experiments the cue orientation was presented visually on the screen in front of <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> and then removed before the sequence of gratings was presented. Using this task it was possible to determine if a neuron's response to a particular orientation was affected by {{whether or not it was}} the orientation for which <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> looking. Over half the neurons examined in V 4 (110 / 192) responded differently to the visual stimuli when <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> cued to look for different orientations. For some neurons responses to all stimuli <b>were</b> strong when <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> cued to look for a particular orientation, but weak when the same stimuli were presented in trials where <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> had <b>been</b> cued to look for another orientation. This type of sensitivity was found in neurons recorded while <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> given a tactile cue, and also in other neurons tested when a visual cue was used, suggesting that the activity was not of direct sensory origin. In support of this, neurons in V 4 were not strongly affected when <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> felt <b>the</b> grooved plate while not performing the orientation matching task.

5|$|Compared to E.nitidus and E.macconnelli, {{the skull}} is {{relatively}} small and slender. It has broad and short incisive foramina (perforations of the palate between the incisors and the molars) and lacks sphenopalatine vacuities which perforate the mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind {{the end of the}} palate. <b>The</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> similar to other members of the genus in the pattern of the arteries of the head. The alisphenoid strut, an extension of the alisphenoid bone which separates two foramina (openings) in the skull (the masticatory-buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium) is rarely present; its presence is more frequent in E.nitidus. The capsular process, a raising of the bone of the mandible (lower jaw) behind the third molar, houses the back end of the lower incisor in most Euryoryzomys, but is absent in E.emmonsae and E.macconnelli. Traits of the teeth {{are similar to those of}} E.nitidus and other Euryoryzomys.|$|E
5|$|Corals are sessile {{animals in}} the class Anthozoa and differ from most other cnidarians in not having a medusa stage in their life cycle. The body unit of <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> a polyp. Most corals are colonial, the initial polyp budding to produce another and the colony {{gradually}} developing from this small start. In stony corals, also known as hard corals, the polyps produce a skeleton composed of calcium carbonate to strengthen and protect the organism. This is deposited by the polyps and by the coenosarc, the living tissue that connects them. The polyps sit in cup-shaped depressions in the skeleton known as corallites. Colonies of stony coral are very variable in appearance; a single species may adopt an encrusting, plate-like, bushy, columnar or massive solid structure, the various forms often being linked to different types of habitat, with variations in light level and water movement being significant.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians are large, low-slung aquatic {{reptiles}} {{with long}} snouts and {{large numbers of}} teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates {{from side to side}} to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above {{the surface of the water}} when <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.|$|E

5|$|Female {{individuals}} of Laevistrombus canarium are generally larger (both shell and soft parts) than male individuals, {{which is also}} the case in other strombid gastropods such as the spider conch (Harpago chiragra) and queen conch (Lobatus gigas). The external anatomy of the soft parts of this species {{is similar to that of}} the other members of the family: the animal has a long extensible snout and thin eyestalks (also known as ommatophores), with well-developed lens eyes at the tips. Each eyestalk has a small sensory tentacle branching off near the end. The large foot of <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> narrow and strong, able to perform the leaping form of locomotion that is also found in other species of Strombidae (such as the queen conch).|$|E
5|$|It {{is listed}} in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which means it is not {{considered}} threatened with extinction, but hunting and trading must be closely monitored. <b>The</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> regulated in all three of its range countries, and is found {{in a number of}} protected areas of the United States, its principal territory. Estimates from the US Fish and Wildlife Service placed bobcat numbers between 700,000 and 1,500,000 in the US in 1988, with increased range and population density suggesting even greater numbers in subsequent years; for these reasons, the U.S. has petitioned CITES to remove the cat from Appendix II. Populations in Canada and Mexico remain stable and healthy. The IUCN lists it as a species of least concern, noting it is relatively widespread and abundant, but information from southern Mexico is poor.|$|E
