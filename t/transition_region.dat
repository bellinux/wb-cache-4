The temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the <b>transition</b> <b>region,</b> which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma.

Rather, it forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments, and is in constant, chaotic motion.

The stellar parameters determining the properties of stellar chromospheres, <b>transition</b> <b>regions</b> and coronae are discussed, including varying magnetic fields, stellar rotation and convection zone parameters. A speculative scenario for the source of chromospheres, <b>transition</b> <b>regions</b> and coronae in O, B and A stars, late-type dwarfs, and G-M giants and supergiants is then presented which is based on the predominant role of magnetic fields in the nonradiative heating of outer atmospheres...|$|R

40|$|Annealing {{effects on}} <b>transition</b> <b>regions</b> at the Si-Si 02 {{interface}} for thin oxide films have been investigated. Thin oxide films with thickness less than 100 A were {{prepared by the}} following methods: (1) dry oxidation, (2) dry oxidation and subsequent annealing in an argon atmosphere, and (3) thinning of thick oxide films formed by dry oxidation. The values of barrier height for electrons at the Si-Si 02 interface have been evaluated from Fowler-Nordheim plots. The values for the samples prepared by (2) and (3) were larger than that by (1). The increase of the barrier height is attributed to the decrease of <b>transition</b> <b>regions</b> induced by annealing or oxidation for long periods. XPS and growth rate measurements were also performed for ultra thin dioxide films formed at low temperature of 600 °C.

Analog circuits depend on operation in the <b>transition</b> <b>region</b> where small changes to Vgs can modulate the output (drain) current. The MOSFET and bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is preferred for accurate matching (of adjacent devices in integrated circuits), higher transconductance and certain temperature characteristics which simplify keeping performance predictable as circuit temperature varies.|$|E
25|$|Like spiral galaxies, {{lenticular}} galaxies can {{possess a}} central bar structure. While the classification system for normal lenticulars depends on dust content, barred lenticular galaxies are classified by {{the prominence of}} the central bar. SB01 galaxies have the least defined bar structure and are only classified as having slightly enhanced surface brightness along {{opposite sides of the}} central bulge. The prominence of the bar increases with index number, thus SB03 galaxies have very well defined bars that can extend through the <b>transition</b> <b>region</b> between the bulge and disk. Unfortunately, the properties of bars in lenticular galaxies have not been researched in great detail. Understanding these properties, as well as understanding the formation mechanism for bars, would help clarify the formation or evolution history of lenticular galaxies.|$|E
25|$|One {{problem with}} wave heating is {{delivery}} of the heat to the appropriate place. Magneto-acoustic waves cannot carry sufficient energy upward through the chromosphere to the corona, both because of the low pressure present in the chromosphere and {{because they tend to}} be reflected back to the photosphere. Alfvén waves can carry enough energy, but do not dissipate that energy rapidly enough once they enter the corona. Waves in plasmas are notoriously difficult to understand and describe analytically, but computer simulations, carried out by Thomas Bogdan and colleagues in 2003, seem to show that Alfvén waves can transmute into other wave modes {{at the base of the}} corona, providing a pathway that can carry large amounts of energy from the photosphere through the chromosphere and <b>transition</b> <b>region</b> and finally into the corona where it dissipates it as heat.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of 3 D digital photography and 3 D digital scanning devices, {{massive amount of}} point samples can be generated in acquisition of complex, real-world objects, and thus create an urgent need for advanced point-based processing and editing. In this paper, we present an interactive method for blending point-based geometries by dragging-and-dropping one point-based model onto another model’s surface metaphor. We first calculate a blending region based on the polygon of interest when the user drags-and-drops the model. Radial basis function is used to construct an implicit surface which smoothly interpolates with the <b>transition</b> <b>regions.</b> Continuing the drag-and-drop operation will make the system recalculate the blending regions and reconstruct the <b>transition</b> <b>regions.</b> The drag-and-drop operation can be compound in a constructive solid geometry (CSG) manner to interactively construct a complex point-based model from multiple simple ones. Experimental results showed that our method generates good quality <b>transition</b> <b>regions</b> between two raw point clouds and can effectively reduce the rate of overlapping during the blending...|$|R

The <b>transition</b> <b>regions</b> are found to be complex in character, consisting of intermediate average field orientations in some cases {{as well as a number}} of large-angle directional discontinuities (DDs). It is suggested that the observed DDs represent multiple traversals of the global heliospheric current sheet caused by local fluctuations in the position of the sheet. There is evidence that such fluctuations are sometimes produced by wavelike motions or surface corrugations of scale length 0. 05 - 0. 1 AU, superimposed on the large-scale structure...|$|R

Several solids, ranging in size from 48 -mu-m to 300 -mu-m and ranging in density from 1 330 kg m- 3 to 2 600 kg m- 3, were tested.
