5|$|Sectors of {{the food}} {{industry}} (manufacturing and retail) have pledged {{to reduce the amount}} of food they directly waste, and additionally what they cause households to waste indirectly. This is planned to happen through a combination of: effective labeling, pack size range, storage advice and packaging that extends the duration of food freshness. The latest initiative in May 2009, rather than a new policy, is seen as an expansion to ongoing attempts to reduce the wider food packaging. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> cut UK household food waste by 155,000 tonnes (2.5% of total waste) before the end of 2010 by helping UK households prevent food going to waste.|$|E

Defeating the aliens brings another wave that is more difficult, a loop which can continue without end.|$|E
