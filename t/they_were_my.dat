In fact, on one occasion, I intimated the propriety of a canine crusade to Mehevi; but the benevolent king would not consent to it. He heard me very patiently; but when I had finished, shook his head, and told me, in confidence, that they were [...] "taboo".|$|E
500|$|On February 26, 2010, the Ethics Committee {{issued its}} report. [...] It {{determined}} that Rangel had violated House gift rules, by accepting reimbursement for his {{travel to the}} conferences. [...] It found {{that he had not}} known of the contributions, but concluded that he was still responsible for them and was required to repay their cost. [...] Five other members were cleared of having violated rules, but were also required to repay their trips. [...] Rangel disagreed with the committee's finding, saying: Because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>my</b> staff members who knew, one of whom has been discharged, [...] that I should have known. Common sense dictates that members of Congress should not be held responsible for what could be the wrongdoing, or mistakes, or errors of staff.|$|E
500|$|Bruce, a boyhood fan of Newcastle United, {{claims to}} have sneaked into St James' Park without paying to watch the team play, saying [...] "I {{have always been a}} Newcastle lad and when I was a kid, I crawled under the {{turnstiles}} to get in to try and save a bob or whatever it was. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>my</b> team, I went to support them as a boy and being a Geordie it's in-bred, you follow the club still the same today." [...] Like several other future professionals from the area, he played football for Wallsend Boys Club. He was also selected for the Newcastle Schools representative team, and at the age of 13 was among a group of players from the team selected to serve as ball boys at the 1974 Football League Cup Final at Wembley Stadium.|$|E

500|$|In Chapter 1 Hitchens {{describes}} abandoning {{religion in}} his youth, and promoting [...] "cruel revolutionary rubbish" [...] as a Trotskyist activist. He claims his generation had become intellectually aloof from religion, rebellious and disillusioned and in Chapter 2 explores further {{reasons for this}} disillusion, including the Suez Crisis and the Profumo Affair. In Chapter 3, Hitchens recounts how he embraced scientific inquiry and adopted liberal positions {{on issues such as}} marriage, abortion, homosexuality, and patriotism. Chapter 4 is a lament for the [...] "noble austerity" [...] of his childhood in Britain. Chapter 5 explores what Hitchens views as the pseudo-religion surrounding Churchill and World War II heroes – a [...] "great cult of noble, patriotic death" [...] whose only equivalent, he claims, was in the Soviet Union. Hitchens then asserts that, [...] "The Christian Church has been powerfully damaged by letting itself be confused with love of country and the making of great wars". In Chapter 6 Hitchens recalls being a foreign correspondent in the Soviet Union and a trip to Mogadishu, and how these experiences convinced him that, [...] "his own civilisation was infinitely precious and utterly vulnerable". In Chapter 7 Hitchens charts his return to Christianity, and makes particular reference to the experience of seeing the Rogier van der Weyden painting The Last Judgement: [...] "I gaped, my mouth actually hanging open. These people did not appear remote or from the ancient past; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>my</b> own generation ... I had absolutely no doubt I was among the damned". In Chapter 8 Hitchens examines the diminishing of Christianity in Britain and its potential causes.|$|E

2500|$|Whilst the Western {{press and}} governments praised Mugabe's early {{announcements}} of his aim of reconciliation {{with the white}} community, tensions swiftly developed on the ground. On 17 March 1980, {{only a few days}} after the election of the new government, a rumour of a coup attempt led Mugabe to confront Walls with the question: [...] "Why are your men trying to kill me?" [...] Walls replied: [...] "If <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>my</b> men you would be dead." ...|$|E

2500|$|No {{account of}} my {{childhood}} {{would be complete without}} mentioning the eunuchs. They waited on me when I ate, dressed and slept; they accompanied me on my walks and to my lessons; they told me stories; and had rewards and beatings from me, but they never left my presence. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>my</b> slaves; and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>my</b> earliest teachers. The eunuchs were all slaves who did all of the work in the Forbidden City such as cooking, gardening, cleaning, entertaining guests, and all of the bureaucratic work needed to govern a vast empire and serving as the emperor's advisers. The eunuchs spoke in a distinctive high-pitched voice and to further prove that they were really eunuchs had to keep their severed penises and testicles in jars of brine that they wore around their necks when working. The Forbidden City was full of treasures, which the eunuchs were constantly stealing and selling on the black market. The business of government and of providing for the emperor created further opportunities for corruption and virtually all of the eunuchs engaged in theft and corruption of one sort or another.|$|E
2500|$|Sturgis {{continued}} to write novels during the 1880s. [...] <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>My</b> Friends and I (1884), John Maidment (1885), Thraldom (1887), and The Comedy of a Country House (1889). Reviewing {{the second of}} these, The Manchester Guardian said, [...] "Readers of Little Comedies know how patiently and ingeniously Mr. Sturgis can draw what may be called the minor scoundrel – the scoundrel whose scoundrelism is so successfully concealed from the world and from himself {{that it is only}} a few people who know him to be a scoundrel at all. [...] He has made a fresh and more audacious study of this type in John Maidment, a study audacious but successful." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 10 April - Bioanalysis {{students}} of the Central University of Venezuela held class at the Plaza de Los Palos Grandes while protesting. A small group of protesters traveled around Caracas dressed in army men costumes and holding signs saying, “As a child, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>my</b> heroes, now the repress me". At night, {{a large group of}} students and citizens protested against their [...] "lost future" [...] and in respect to for those who have died during the protests. Peace talks between Maduro and the opposition's Democratic Unity Round Table alliance, including Henry Capriles, are televised. Foreign ministers of Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador also partake, while a Vatican representative reads a letter from Pope Francis supporting national reconciliation. [...] A follow-up meeting is announced for April 15. After the six hours of peace talks, skepticism was generated between conflicting parties and also among citizens in Venezuela.|$|E
2500|$|Prime Minister Mugabe kept Peter Walls, {{the head}} of the army, in his {{government}} and put him in charge of integrating the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA), Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA), and the Rhodesian Army. While Western media outlets praised Mugabe's efforts at reconciliation with the white minority, tension soon developed. On 17 March 1980, after several unsuccessful assassination attempts Mugabe asked Walls, [...] "Why are your men trying to kill me?" [...] Walls replied, [...] "If <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>my</b> men you would be dead." [...] BBC news interviewed Walls on 11 August 1980. He told the BBC that he had asked British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to annul the 1980 election prior to the official announcement of the result on the grounds that Mugabe used intimidation to win the election. Walls said Thatcher had not replied to his request. On 12 August British government officials denied that they had not responded, saying Antony Duff, Deputy Governor of Salisbury, told Walls on 3 March that Thatcher would not annul the election.|$|E
2500|$|Westbrook {{has said}} that the cast and crew became like a second family to her, with the roles in the soap {{mirroring}} their relationships off-screen. In her autobiography she comments, [...] "Sid [...] and I became very close [...] we were as thick as thieves. When we weren't shooting together we'd hang out [...] Once Sid and I got so bored hanging around on set that we decided to take the milk float for a spin around Albert Square, but Sid drove it too fast and turned it over [...] we couldn't stop laughing, but the producers didn't seem to share our amusement. We were seriously told off that day." [...] She has described other actors like Michelle Gayle, Letitia Dean, Adam Woodyatt and Nick Berry like brothers and sisters, and has said she was very close to older cast members such as June Brown, Wendy Richard, Mike Reid and Gillian Taylforth. She has also revealed that her off-screen relationship with actors McFadden and Kemp mirrored her character's on-screen one: [...] "In the soap <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>my</b> older brothers, always looking out for me, making sure I didn't get into trouble, and off set they were exactly the same." ...|$|E

[...] She choose to support Labour: [...] "The Liberal audiences were nice narrow decent people. They sat upright in rows and clapped their cotton gloves... But when I got to the Labour meetings in the slums, among the costers and the railway men and the women in tenth hand velvet hats – when I saw their pinched grey-and-yellow faces in those steamy halls, I knew all of a sudden that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>my</b> people". [...] She soon {{became a member of the}} party and supported her husband as the Labour Party candidate for Holland-with-Boston in Lincolnshire. [...] The seat had gone to the Liberals in a by election earlier that year and Rivers failed to win it back. Amber attempted to get her theories on currency, later brought together in her book The Nationalisation of Banking, adopted by the Labour Party, and she and Rivers became responsible for a party publication called Womens Leader. Amber remained active in the Fabian Society, and by this time many Fabians agreed that there was a need to work through the parliamentary Labour Party. She stood twice as a candidate for Hendon, in 1931 and 1935 ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{his release}} from San Quentin in 1960, Haggard started digging ditches for his brother's {{electrical}} contracting company. Soon, he was performing again, and later began recording with Tally Records. The Bakersfield sound was developing in the area as a reaction against the overproduced honky tonk of the Nashville sound. Haggard's first record for Tally was [...] "Singing My Heart Out" [...] backed by [...] "Skid Row"; {{it was not a}} success, and only 200 copies were pressed. In 1962, Haggard wound up performing at a Wynn Stewart show in Las Vegas and heard Wynn's [...] "Sing a Sad Song." [...] He asked for permission to record it, and the resulting single was a national hit in 1964. The following year, he had his first national top-10 record with [...] "(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers," [...] written by Liz Anderson, mother of country singer Lynn Anderson, and his career was off and running. Haggard recalls having been talked into visiting Anderson—a woman he did not know—at her house to hear her sing some songs she had written. [...] "If there was anything I didn't wanna do, it was sit around some danged woman's house and listen to her cute little songs. But I went anyway. She was a pleasant enough lady, pretty, with a nice smile, but I was all set to be bored to death, even more so when she got out a whole bunch of songs and went over to an old pump organ.... There <b>they</b> <b>were.</b> <b>My</b> God, one hit right after another. There must have been four or five number one songs there...." ...|$|E
