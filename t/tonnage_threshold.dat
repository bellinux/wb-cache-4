30|$|Since {{nanomaterials}} are substances {{within the}} meaning of REACH, they also have to be registered if the yearly manufactured or imported quantity reaches 1 tonne. As it is not regulated otherwise, a manufacturer/importer who manufactures/imports not only a nanomaterial but also the corresponding bulk material with the same chemical identity registers the nanomaterial and the bulk material together in one registration. Nanomaterials are not regarded as separate substances within {{the meaning of}} the current REACH rules, but as substances in a certain form. The sum of the quantities (nanomaterial(s)[*]+[*]bulk) is decisive for the calculation of the aforementioned <b>tonnage</b> <b>threshold.</b> If no corresponding bulk material is manufactured or imported by the same registrant, the nanomaterial has to be registered on its own accordingly. However, the registration dossier of the nanomaterial can {{be a part of the}} joint submission for the chemically identical substance. For yearly quantities of 10 tonnes or more, a chemical safety report has to be submitted.|$|E
30|$|Regarding {{environmental}} information, chronic tests {{instead of}} acute tests and toxicity to sediment and soil organisms are necessary at lower <b>tonnage</b> <b>thresholds.</b> This is justified by potentially wide dispersive use even by a low mass application {{linked with the}} uncertainties regarding (eco-) toxicity, environmental fate and exposure. If the physico-chemical characteristics of different nanoforms of the same substance differ in a relevant manner, {{they have to be}} considered separately for the further test performance and REACH requirements. A possibility to handle surface-treated nanomaterials would be to consider them as a separate nanoform of the untreated substance.|$|R
30|$|In this publication, {{the authors}} present their {{considerations}} and recommendations on how REACH can adequately {{be adapted to}} nanomaterials. In the author's view, the bulk form and nanoforms of the same chemical composition {{should be treated as}} the same substance in the context of REACH. However, the regulation of nanomaterials under REACH has to meet specific requirements. Taking into account the plurality of physico-chemical characteristics and resulting changes in the hazard profile, an approach must be found to adequately cover nanomaterials under REACH. Accordingly, the REACH information requirements have to be adapted. This includes lower <b>tonnage</b> <b>thresholds</b> for different REACH obligations (e.g. registration, chemical safety report) which are justified by highly dispersed use together with low mass application, linked with the uncertainties regarding (eco-) toxicity, environmental fate and exposure. If the physico-chemical characteristics of different nanoforms of the same substance differ in a relevant manner they have to be considered separately for further test performance and REACH requirements.|$|R
