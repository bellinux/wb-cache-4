5|$|Meanwhile, Donna {{returns home}} to warn her mother, Sylvia (Jacqueline King), and {{grandfather}} Wilfred Mott (Bernard Cribbins) about the Doctor, having been advised {{to do so}} by Martha. Concerned about the implications of telling the truth, Donna decides against warning her mother. The Doctor investigates the ATMOS device attached to Donna's car and discovers a secondary function: the device can emit a poisonous gas. Wilfred attempts to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> off the road, but is trapped when Staal activates all 400 million ATMOS devices installed in cars worldwide. The episode's cliffhanger depicts Donna shouting for help while the Doctor stares helplessly at a street full of cars emitting the gas, while on their ship orbiting the planet, the Sontarans prepare themselves for battle.|$|E
5|$|Digital Dimension {{worked on}} 200 visual effects {{shots in the}} film, {{including}} the sequence that shows characters John McClane and Matt Farrell crouching between two cars as another car lands {{on top of the}} other cars. To achieve this effect, a crane yanked the car and threw it in the air onto the two cars that were also being pulled by cables. The shot was completed when the two characters were integrated into the footage of the car stunt after the lighting was adjusted and CGI glass and debris were added. In the same sequence, John McClane destroys a helicopter that several of Gabriel's henchman are riding in by ramming it with a car. This was accomplished by first filming one take where one of Gabriel's henchman, Rand, jumps from the helicopter, and in the next <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> is propelled into the stationary helicopter as it is hoisted by wires. The final view of the shot overlays the two takes, with added CGI for the debris and moving rotor blades. The company also assisted in adding cars for traffic collisions and masses of people for evacuations from several government buildings.|$|E
5|$|Following Dana's murder, {{the killer}} uses her {{cellphone}} {{to call the}} girls. Figuring out that something is wrong, they go outside to look for her. There, they discover Eve's decapitated head inside her car. Realizing there is a killer out there, Kelli calls 9-1-1, {{only to be told}} that due to the snowstorm, help would be unavailable for at least two hours. When their housemother Mrs. Mac and Heather decide to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and reach the police station on their own, Kelli, Leigh and Melissa all go to Lauren's room to see them through their window and make sure they leave safely. Noticing that the car has started but they're not leaving, Kelli and Leigh go to check on them through the basement where Leigh slips on Mrs. Mac's blood, who had gotten killed by a falling icicle. Going back to Lauren's room, after a quick confrontation between Leigh and Kyle, they realize that Lauren has also been killed and despite protest from Kyle, decide to go to the attic in case any of the girls are still alive.|$|E

25|$|Conspiring {{with his}} mentor Gilliam and second-in-command Edgar, Curtis Everett plans {{to lead the}} tail {{passengers}} in a revolt that will take {{them all the way}} up to the engine. Mason and armed guards come to take two small children, Andy and Timmy. Andy's father Andrew attempts to fight back, but is punished by Mason by being forced to put his arm into the extreme cold outside the train, effectively amputating it. Enraged, Curtis initiates their plan the next time they are to be fed, taking the security and prison cars. Curtis releases security expert Namgoong Minsu and his clairvoyant daughter Yona from the prison car so he can disable the locks between cars, offering them a hallucinogenic drug called Kronole as payment. They <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> where insects are ground up to make their protein bars, and Gilliam suggests that if they take the subsequent water supply car, they will control any negotiation with Wilford. Instead, they are ambushed by a mass of masked men with hatchets led by Franco the Elder under Mason's orders; after a bloody battle Curtis sacrifices Edgar to win the fight. Mason is taken captive and Curtis, Namgoong, Yona, Tanya, Andrew and Gilliam's bodyguard Grey continue on with her as a hostage.|$|E

2500|$|Already {{the growth}} of vehicle {{ownership}} in America had not been held back by congestion in urban areas; they observed that congestion in Britain's smaller land mass might limit the use of cars but probably not affect people's desire for ownership as they became more affluent and hoped to try to use their cars.

2500|$|In 1900, while {{employed}} at Lohner Coach Factory, Ferdinand Porsche developed the Mixte, a 4WD series-hybrid version of [...] "System Lohner-Porsche" [...] electric carriage that previously appeared in 1900 Paris World Fair. George Fischer sold hybrid buses to England in 1901; Knight Neftal produced a racing hybrid in 1902. In 1905, Henri Pieper of Germany/Belgium introduced a hybrid vehicle {{with an electric}} motor/generator, batteries, and a small gasoline engine. [...] It used the electric motor to charge its batteries at cruise speed and used both motors to accelerate or climb a hill. The Pieper factory {{was taken over by}} Imperia, after Pieper died. The 1915 Dual Power, made by the Woods Motor Vehicle electric car maker, had a four-cylinder ICE and an electric motor. Below [...] the electric motor alone drove the vehicle, drawing power from a battery pack, and above this speed the [...] "main" [...] engine cut in to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> up to its [...] top speed. About 600 were made up to 1918. The Woods hybrid was a commercial failure, proving to be too slow for its price, and too difficult to service. In England, the prototype Lanchester petrol-electric car was made in 1927. It was not a success, but the vehicle is on display in Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum. The United States Army's 1928 Experimental Motorized Force tested a gasoline-electric bus in a truck convoy.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 October 2008, seven Russian {{soldiers}} were killed and another seven wounded by a car bomb that exploded near the Russian military base. Among them was Colonel Ivan Petrik, the peacekeeper's Chief of Staff. The Russians accused the Georgians of orchestrating the [...] "terrorist attack", claiming that just before the blast, the Russians arrested two cars, four Georgians and seized light firearms and two grenades. [...] "The cars and the detained people were escorted to Tskhinvali. During the search {{of one of the}} cars, an explosive device equivalent to some 20kg of TNT went off," [...] a military spokesman told Interfax. The South Ossetian leader accused Georgia of [...] "state terrorism". [...] "The latest terrorist attacks in South Ossetia prove that Georgia has not renounced its policy of state terrorism," [...] he said. [...] "We have no doubt that these terrorist acts are the work of Georgia special forces." [...] The Georgian government blamed Russia for the incident. [...] "If provocations and tensions are in the interest of anyone, it's the Russians," [...] the Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili told the Reuters news agency, [...] "They are doing everything not to pull troops out within the set term". Georgia also said it would have had to find Ossetians to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> into the Russian-controlled area. [...] "I don't understand the logic. How could the Georgian secret service plan that the Ossetians would steal the car and that the Russians would take it to their base. Are we geniuses or what?" [...] Utiashvili said.
