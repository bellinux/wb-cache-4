A study of the species' distribution in Sweden reported that in the 1940s and 50s, it grew in beech woods with broad-leaved grasses and herbs in topsoils with soil pH levels between 5.0 and 6.6, but the populations have since decreased owing to soil acidification during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades.</b> Fruit bodies collected near arsenic-contaminated sites {{have been shown to}} bioaccumulate arsenic, largely in the form of arsenobetaine.|$|E
5|$|Five Points {{is a small}} {{commercial}} district {{centered on}} and around the five-way intersection between Park, Lomax, and Margaret Streets. The area was originally residential, but transitioned to commercial uses after World War I and several retail buildings were constructed. The Park Arcade Building, an Italian Renaissance revival structure with storefronts marked by variant rooflines, set the architectural tone for the district when it was completed in 1928. Other notable features include Sun-Ray Cinema, formerly Riverside Theater, which opened in 1927 as the first movie theater in Florida equipped to show talking pictures. Over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades,</b> Five Points has become known for its edgy, bohemian character and many independent shops, restaurants and businesses.|$|E
5|$|While Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) is away at an {{emergency}} Federation conference, the Enterprise crew discovers an ancient space capsule from Earth. Inside they find three humans in cryonic chambers. Lt. Cdr. Data (Brent Spiner) asks {{to move the}} chambers to the Enterprise and Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) agrees. Picard returns and orders the Enterprise to the Neutral Zone, as several Federation outposts near {{the edges of the}} zone have not responded to communications. He explains that the conference was about the potential threat of the Romulans, who have not been seen for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades.</b> As Data and Chief Medical Officer Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) work to thaw the cryonically preserved humans, Picard admonishes Data for bringing them aboard during a crucial time, and puts Riker in charge of looking after them.|$|E

40|$|Prejudice, the "pre-judging " {{of people}} on the basis of {{ascribed}} characteristics, is ubiquitous. Modern societies differ from one another only in the degree to which certain groups are set apart from the social mainstream and consequently suffer inequality of opportunity and inequity of condition. The Growth of Tolerance The bad news is that sexism, racism, ageism, ethnic intolerance, religious bigotry, and all manner of other injustices persist in Western industrial societies despite calls for human rights {{all the way from the}} United Nations down to national, sub-national and even municipal governments, to say nothing of the efforts of well-meaning private individuals, associations and businesses. Fundamental conflicts remain and disputes continue to lead to ugly confrontations and physical violence.

40|$|This study {{retrospectively}} {{analyzed the}} magnitude and epidemiology of community-onset Staphylococcus aureus (COSA) infections and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infec-tions in 4 Connecticut metropolitan areas (population, 1. 1 million). The study looked at hospital medical records of persons admitted with S. aureus bacteremia in 1998. COSA was categorized as “health care associated, ” “with underlying medical condition, ” or “no under-lying medical condition. ” Overall, 48 % of S. aureus bacteremic infections were COSA (inci-dence, 17 cases/ 100, 000 persons). Incidence increased with age and higher population density. In all, 62 % of infections were health care associated; 85 % of the remaining cases had underlying medical conditions. MRSA accounted for 16 % of health care–associated cases and cases with underlying conditions but no cases with no underlying conditions. COSA bacteremic infections are as common as those due to pneumococci. MRSA is a well-established cause of COSA among persons at high medical risk for S. aureus infection. Additional study to understand community-onset MRSA acquisition is needed.

25|$|Today, {{the pure}} science of optics is called optical science or optical physics to {{distinguish}} it from applied optical sciences, which {{are referred to as}} optical engineering. Prominent subfields of optical engineering include illumination engineering, photonics, and optoelectronics with practical applications like lens design, fabrication and testing of optical components, and image processing. Some of these fields overlap, with nebulous boundaries between the subjects terms that mean slightly different things {{in different parts of the}} world and in different areas of industry.

In 2001, 16.71 percent of the population were 65 years old and older, 68.12 percent between the ages of 15 and 64 years old, and 15.18 percent were 14 years old and younger.

25|$|Somalis have old {{visual art}} traditions, which include pottery, jewelry and wood carving. In the medieval period, {{affluent}} urbanites commissioned local wood and marble carvers {{to work on}} their interiors and houses. Intricate patterns also adorn the mihrabs and pillars of ancient Somali mosques. Artistic carving was considered the province of men, whereas the textile industry was mainly that of women. Among the nomads, carving, especially woodwork, was widespread and could be found on the most basic objects such as spoons, combs and bowls. It also included more complex structures, such as the portable nomadic house, the aqal. In <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades,</b> traditional carving of windows, doors and furniture have given way to workshops employing electrical machinery, which deliver the same results in a far shorter time period.|$|E

25|$|The {{first line}} of {{evidence}} {{is based on a}} physical understanding of how greenhouse gases trap heat, how the climate system responds to increases in greenhouse gases, and how other human and natural factors influence climate. The second line of evidence is from indirect estimates of climate changes over the last 1,000 to 2,000 years. These records are obtained from living things and their remains (like tree rings and corals) and from physical quantities (like the ratio between lighter and heavier isotopes of oxygen in ice cores), which change in measurable ways as climate changes. The lesson from these data is that global surface temperatures over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades</b> are clearly unusual, in that they were higher than at any time during at least the past 400 years. For the Northern Hemisphere, the recent temperature rise is clearly unusual in at least the last 1,000 years (see graph opposite).|$|E
25|$|In European {{countries}} which were most profoundly {{influenced by the}} Reformation, Protestantism still remains the most practiced religion.

In other historical Protestant strongholds such as Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Latvia, Estonia and Hungary, it {{remains one of the}} most popular religions. Although Czech Republic was the site of one of the most significant pre-reformation movements, there are only few Protestant adherents; mainly due to historical reasons like persecution of Protestants by the Catholic Habsburgs, restrictions during the Communist rule, and also the ongoing secularization. Over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades,</b> religious practice has been declining as secularization has increased. According to a 2012 study about Religiosity in the European Union in 2012 by Eurobarometer, Protestants made up 12% of the EU population. According to Pew Research Center, Protestants constituted nearly one fifth (or 17.8%) of the continent's Christian population in 2010.
