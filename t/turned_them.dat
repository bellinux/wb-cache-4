5|$|For 1943 and 1944, Clarence Spears was the Maryland head coach. Like Shaughnessy, Spears {{had taken}} an underachieving team and <b>turned</b> <b>them</b> around. In 1925, he took over Minnesota, which had posted a 3–3–2 record the prior season, and led them to {{a share of the}} 1927 Big Ten championship. However, at Maryland, when Spears {{accumulated}} a record of 5–12–1 after two seasons, he too was replaced.|$|E

5|$|In 1946, former Chicago White Sox {{teammate}} Ted Lyons was the {{new manager}} of the White Sox, and offered Berg a coaching position. Berg declined. Boston Red Sox owner Thomas Yawkey, who was much closer to Berg when he played for the Red Sox, matched Lyons' offer, but Berg still <b>turned</b> <b>them</b> down. Berg did not apply for a teaching position, or join a law firm.|$|E

A few months later, Billingham held a coaching camp for secondary school students. His camp had a lot of primary school students in attendance.|$|E

He then attached a burning torch to each pair of foxes' tails and <b>turned</b> <b>them</b> loose in the grain fields and olive groves of the Philistines.

5|$|When Slayton {{submitted}} the proposed crew assignments to NASA headquarters, George Mueller <b>turned</b> <b>them</b> {{down on the}} grounds that the crew was too inexperienced. So Slayton asked Jim Lovell, who had been the backup commander for Apollo 11, and was slated to command Apollo 14, if his crew would be willing to fly Apollo 13 instead. He agreed to do so, and Shepard's inexperienced crew was assigned to Apollo 14.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930–31 season, {{the team}} was openly selling players to make ends meet. Star defenceman King Clancy was sold to Toronto for an {{unprecedented}} $35,000 and two players on October 11, 1930. The team fell into last place {{for the first time}} since 1898. In 1931, a potential deal arose with the owners of Chicago Stadium, including grain magnate James E. Norris, who wanted to move the team to Chicago, but the deal was vetoed by Chicago Black Hawks owner Frederic McLaughlin who did not want another team in his territory. Norris bought the bankrupt Detroit Falcons instead and <b>turned</b> <b>them</b> into the Detroit Red Wings.|$|E

5|$|The rumored Ho-Chunk {{attack on}} Fort Crawford never came, {{and so in}} October 1826, Colonel Snelling moved the {{garrison}} to Fort Snelling, where he hoped to reduce hostilities between the Dakotas (Sioux) and the Ojibwes (Chippewas). The two Ho-Chunk prisoners were also moved to Fort Snelling. In May 1827, after Dakotas attacked an Ojibwe party near Fort Snelling, Colonel Snelling arrested four of the Dakotas and <b>turned</b> <b>them</b> over to the Ojibwes, who killed them. This angered some Dakotas, who encouraged the Ho-Chunks to help them strike at the Americans, falsely telling them that the Ho-Chunks prisoners had also been {{turned over to the}} Ojibwes for execution.|$|E
5|$|Townshend {{took charge}} of the British forces and {{realised}} that Bougainville's column was approaching from the British rear, having taken some time to arrive from Cap Rouge. He quickly formed up two battalions from the confused troops on the field and <b>turned</b> <b>them</b> to meet the oncoming French, a day-saving manoeuvre; instead of attacking with a well rested and ready force, Bougainville retreated while the rest of Montcalm's army slipped back across the St. Charles.|$|E

Lewis bought him a supply of paint and canvasses and Whale re-discovered his love of painting. Eventually he built a large studio for himself.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{proposals}} {{were made in}} the 1900s to reconstruct them and replace their obsolete armor and guns, but none of these were carried out. Ekaterina II and Chesma were both eventually sunk as target ships after being decommissioned in 1907, but both Sinop and Georgii Pobedonosets were converted into artillery training ships before becoming guardships at Sevastopol before World War I. There they spent most of the war and were captured by the Germans in 1918, who eventually <b>turned</b> <b>them</b> over to the British who sabotaged their engines when they abandoned the Crimea in 1919. Immobile they were captured by both the Whites and the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War. Sinop was abandoned when Wrangel's fleet sailed for Bizerte, but Georgii Pobedonosets was towed there. Sinop was scrapped beginning in 1922 by the Soviets while Georgii Pobedonosets was eventually scrapped in Bizerte beginning in 1930 by the French.|$|E
5|$|Before Live and Let Die {{had been}} published, the {{producer}} Alexander Korda had read a proof {{copy of the}} novel. He {{thought it was the}} most exciting story he had read for years, but was unsure whether it was suitable for a film. Nevertheless, he wanted to show the story to the directors David Lean and Carol Reed for their impressions, although nothing came of Korda's initial interest. In 1955, following the television broadcast of an adaptation of Fleming's earlier novel Casino Royale, Warner Bros. expressed an interest in Live and Let Die, and offered $500 for an option, against $5,000 if the film was made. Fleming thought the terms insufficient and <b>turned</b> <b>them</b> down.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{took over}} as {{production}} head after Selznick's departure and oversaw two hits starring Hepburn: Morning Glory (1933), for which she won her first Oscar, and Little Women (1933), director Cukor's second collaboration with the actress. Among the studio's in-house productions, the latter was the biggest box-office success of the decade. Ginger Rogers had already made several minor films for RKO when Cooper signed her to a seven-year contract and cast her in the big-budget musical Flying Down to Rio (1933). Rogers was paired with Astaire, making his movie debut. Billed fourth and fifth respectively, the picture <b>turned</b> <b>them</b> into stars. Hermes Pan, assistant to the film's dance director, {{would become one of}} Hollywood's leading choreographers through his subsequent work with Astaire.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} years of his life Constantine made plans for a {{campaign}} against Persia. In a letter written to the king of Persia, Shapur, Constantine had asserted his patronage over Persia's Christian subjects and urged Shapur to treat them well. The letter is undatable. In response to border raids, Constantine sent Constantius to guard the eastern frontier in 335. In 336, prince Narseh invaded Armenia (a Christian kingdom since 301) and installed a Persian client on the throne. Constantine then resolved to campaign against Persia himself. He treated the war as a Christian crusade, calling for bishops to accompany the army and commissioning a tent {{in the shape of a}} church to follow him everywhere. Constantine planned to be baptized in the Jordan River before crossing into Persia. Persian diplomats came to Constantinople over the winter of 336–337, seeking peace, but Constantine <b>turned</b> <b>them</b> away. The campaign was called off, however, when Constantine became sick in the spring of 337.|$|E
5|$|To {{maximize}} {{their chances of}} success, Square searched for a Western company to assist with releasing the PC version. Eidos Interactive, whose release of Tomb Raider had <b>turned</b> <b>them</b> into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port. The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time. To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a triangular shape for the cover and box. They agreed on a contract price of $1.8 million, making initial sales forecasts of 100,000 units based on that outlay. The PC version was released in North America and Europe on June 25, 1998; the port was not released in Japan. Within one month, sales of the port exceeded the initial forecasts. The PC version would end up providing the source code for subsequent ports.|$|E
5|$|Both Berman and Piller {{sought to}} have Forbes {{sign on to}} portray Ro as a main {{character}} in the series, but she <b>turned</b> <b>them</b> down. She liked making occasional appearances on The Next Generation, but {{did not want to}} tie herself down to a five- to six-year main cast contract at that point in her career. She was also apprehensive about the types of demands fan appearances made on the stars of that series, {{and did not want to}} undertake the level of appearances that would be expected of a main cast member in Deep Space Nine. The producers of Deep Space Nine decided to create a new character to fit a similar mould, which resulted in the creation of Kira Nerys, who was played by Nana Visitor. This was designed to require as minimal a change as possible in the premise of the pilot at that time, which was already under production. During the course of the series, Forbes told interviewers that she was interested in making one-off appearances in the series if she liked the story and role.|$|E
