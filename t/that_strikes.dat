5|$|Although {{increasing}} {{echelons of}} the scale correspond to stronger winds, the rankings are not absolute in terms of effects. Lower-category storms can inflict greater damage than higher-category storms, depending on factors such as local terrain, population density and total rainfall. For instance, a Category2 hurricane <b>that</b> <b>strikes</b> a major urban area will likely do more damage than a large Category5 hurricane <b>that</b> <b>strikes</b> a mostly rural region. In fact, tropical systems of less than hurricane strength can produce significant damage and human casualties, especially from flooding and landslides.|$|E

5|$|Although extratropical {{cyclones}} {{are almost}} always classified as baroclinic since they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint gradient within the westerlies, they can sometimes become barotropic late in their life cycle when the temperature distribution around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform with radius. An extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm, and from there into a tropical cyclone, if it dwells over warm waters sufficient to warm its core, {{and as a result}} develops central convection. A particularly intense type of extratropical cyclone <b>that</b> <b>strikes</b> during winter is known colloquially as a nor'easter.|$|E

5|$|On 8 October, it was {{announced}} that postal workers had voted three to one in favour of taking strike action over job security and working conditions. It was later announced that a national strike would be held on Thursday 22 October and Friday 23 October. After further talks failed, more strikes were announced to take place on Thursday 29 October, Friday 30 October and Saturday 31 October. Discussions continued throughout the second wave of strikes with proposals being put to both sides, but these were overshadowed by the announcement of a third walkout on Friday 6 November and Monday 9 November. However, on 5 November it {{was announced}} <b>that</b> <b>strikes</b> had been called off until the New Year to allow time for fresh talks to take place. A resolution to the dispute was finally reached following lengthy discussions on 8 March 2010, and on 27 April it was reported that postal workers voted to accept the deal.|$|E
25|$|The ball is {{put into}} play by use of the plunger, a {{spring-loaded}} rod <b>that</b> <b>strikes</b> the ball as it rests in an entry lane, or as in some newer games, by a button that signals the game logic to fire a solenoid <b>that</b> <b>strikes</b> the ball. With both devices {{the result is the}} same: The ball is propelled upwards onto the playfield. Once a ball is in play, it tends to move downward towards the player, although the ball can move in any direction, sometimes unpredictably, due to contact with objects on the playfield or by the player's own actions. To return the ball to {{the upper part of the}} playfield, the player makes use of one or more flippers.|$|E

25|$|Because of its {{location}} near the Atlantic Coast, Maryland is somewhat vulnerable to tropical cyclones, although the Delmarva Peninsula {{and the outer}} banks of North Carolina provide a large buffer, such <b>that</b> <b>strikes</b> from major hurricanes (category 3 or above) occur infrequently. More often, Maryland gets {{the remnants of a}} tropical system which has already come ashore and released most of its energy. Maryland averages around 30–40 days of thunderstorms a year, and averages around six tornado strikes annually.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{different}} types of whistle tones - hole tones and edge tones. A hole (or 'oriﬁce') tone is produced by a fast-moving cylinder (or 'vena contracta') of air that interacts with the slow-moving anulus of air surrounding it. Instability in the boundary layer leads to perturbations that increase in size until a feedback path is established whereby specific frequencies of the resonance chamber are emphasized. An edge tone, on the other hand, is generated by a thin jet of air <b>that</b> <b>strikes</b> an obstacle. Vortices are shed near the point of disturbance in the ﬂow, alternating {{on each side of the}} obstacle or 'wedge'.|$|E

25|$|Image intensifiers convert {{low levels}} of light photons into {{electrons}}, amplify those electrons, and then convert the electrons back into photons of light. Photons from a low-light source enter an objective lens which focuses an image into a photocathode. The photocathode releases electrons via the photoelectric effect as the incoming photons hit it. The electrons are accelerated through a high-voltage potential into a microchannel plate (MCP). Each high-energy electron <b>that</b> <b>strikes</b> the MCP causes the release of many electrons from the MCP in a process called secondary cascaded emission. The MCP is tilted to encourage more electron collisions, thus {{increasing the amount of}} emission of secondary electrons.|$|E
25|$|CSP-Stirling {{is known}} to have the highest {{efficiency}} of all solar technologies (around 30%, compared to solar photovoltaic's approximately 15%), and is predicted to be able to produce the cheapest energy among all renewable energy sources in high-scale production and hot areas, semi-deserts, etc. A dish Stirling system uses a large, reflective, parabolic dish (similar in shape to a satellite television dish). It focuses all the sunlight <b>that</b> <b>strikes</b> the dish up onto a single point above the dish, where a receiver captures the heat and transforms it into a useful form. Typically the dish is coupled with a Stirling engine in a Dish-Stirling System, but also sometimes a steam engine is used. These create rotational kinetic energy that can be converted to electricity using an electric generator.|$|E

[...] In some ways though, they were essentially different.
