On one hand, OWRT needs two-phase for transmission in each direction, thus the data rate in each phase should be twice of that in DT, which requires more transmit power. On the other hand, OWRT has higher equivalent channel gain, which reduces the required transmit power. In low <b>traffic</b> <b>region,</b> doubling the lower data rate has little impact on the transmit power, and thus OWRT is more energy efficient due to higher equivalent channel gain.|$|E

The current model proposes that phosphorylation-dependent binding of 14 - 3 - 3 sterically masks a COPI-binding motif. However, the direct effects of phosphorylation on COPI binding and on the binding parameters of 14 - 3 - 3 isoforms are still unknown. We find that phosphorylation of the <b>trafficking</b> control <b>region</b> prevents COPI binding {{even in the absence of}} 14 - 3 - 3, and we present a quantitative analysis of the binding of all human 14 - 3 - 3 isoforms to the <b>trafficking</b> control <b>regions</b> of TASK- 1 and TASK- 3. Surprisingly, the affinities of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins for TASK- 1 are two orders of magnitude lower than for TASK- 3.

30|$|We {{also showed}} the {{relationship}} between the energy efficiency and the spectral efficiency, i.e., the required amount of data normalized by bandwidth and time duration, for all the three transmission strategy, which is largely dependent on the circuit power consumption. With zero circuit power, the energy efficiency achieves its maximum value as the spectral efficiency approaches zero. With non-zero circuit powers in transmit and receive duration but negligible circuit powers in idle duration, energy efficiency does not change with spectral efficiency in low <b>traffic</b> <b>region</b> but reduce sharply in high <b>traffic</b> <b>region.</b> With non-zero circuit powers in all the transmit, receive and idle modes, there exists a non-zero optimal spectral efficiency that maximizes the maximal energy efficiency.|$|E
30|$|In Figure 3, {{because of}} the normalization, the EE curves of DT under {{different}} α overlap. It shows that the spectral efficient strategy TWRT is also energy efficient with respect to OWRT. When the attenuation factor is large, i.e., α = 4, the EE of TWRT is {{higher than that of}} DT, while when α = 2 the result is just the opposite. The comparison between DT and OWRT depends both on the packet size and the channel condition. When α = 2, DT always outperforms OWRT. When α = 4, OWRT is superior to DT in low <b>traffic</b> <b>region,</b> but is inferior to DT in high <b>traffic</b> <b>region.</b> All these results agree well with our analysis.|$|E

Some previous researches on the large urban traffic systems easily change into NPC problems. We purpose a multi-agent inductive control model based on the distributed approach. To describe the real traffic scene, this model designs four different types of intelligent agents, i. e. we regard each lane, route, intersection and <b>traffic</b> <b>region</b> as different types of intelligent agents. Each agent can achieve the real-time traffic data from its neighbor agents, and decision-making agents establish real-time traffic signal plans through the communication between local agents and their neighbor agents. To evaluate the traffic system, this paper takes the average delay, the stopped time and the average speed as performance parameters. Finally, the distributed multi-agent is simulated on the VISSIM simulation platform, the simulation {{results show that the}} multi-agent system is more effective than the adaptive control system in solving the traffic congestion. ...|$|E

30|$|In {{a special}} case, {{if there are}} two or more next neighbors with the same lowest {{gradient}} values, the node chooses the next forwarder randomly in a stochastic scheme, similar to tossing a die [30]. With hop count, each node discovers a list of parents, siblings, and children with respect to each sink from its neighbors, whose hop count is respectively one hop lower, equal, or one hop greater on the path toward a specific sink. The node maintains a table with the relative nodes of each sink. In light traffic, the node should choose routes with the lowest distance to the sink {{in order to ensure}} low energy consumption. However, since a large number of nodes become active and send data to the sinks simultaneously, this causes areas of congestion, leading to packet delays or loss.

40|$|When {{multiple}} job {{processes are}} served by a single scheduler, the queueing delays of one process are often affected by the others, resulting in a timing side channel that leaks the arrival pattern of one process to the others. In this work, we study such a timing side channel between a regular user and a malicious attacker. Utilizing Shannon’s mutual information {{as a measure of}} information leakage between the user and attacker, we analyze privacy-preserving behaviors of common work-conserving schedulers. We find that the attacker can always learn perfectly the user’s arrival process in a longest-queue-first (LQF) scheduler. When the user’s job arrival rate is very low (near zero), first-come-first-serve (FCFS) and round robin schedulers both completely reveal the user’s arrival pattern. The near-complete information leakage in the low-rate <b>traffic</b> <b>region</b> is proven to be reduced by half in a work-conserving version of TDMA (WC-TDMA) scheduler, which turns out to be privacy-optimal in the class of deterministic-working-conserving (det-WC) schedulers, according to a universal lower bound on information leakage we derive for all det-WC schedulers.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a novel methodology to divide a <b>traffic</b> <b>region</b> into subregions such that in each subregion a Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) {{can be used}} to determine the state of that subregion. The region division is based on the theory of complex networks. We exploit the inherent network characteristics through PageRank centrality algorithm to identify the most significant nodes in the traffic network. We use these significant nodes as the seeds for a Voronoi diagram based partitioning mechanism of the network. A network wide hierarchical control framework is then presented which controls these sub regions individually and the network as a whole. At the subregion level a feedback controller is designed based on MFD concept. At the network level we develop a dynamic toll pricing algorithm to control the inflows into the network. This dynamic toll pricing is coupled with the subregion controller and thus forming a network wide hierarchical control. We use optimal control theory to design the dynamic toll pricing. A cost function is designed and then Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is used to derive an optimal control law that uses real-time information. The objective of the dynamic toll algorithm is {{to strike a balance between}} the toll price and optimal traffic conditions in each of the subregions.
