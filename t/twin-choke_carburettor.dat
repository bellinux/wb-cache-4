25|$|Like its predecessor, the three-litre engine had a {{cast iron}} block, an {{aluminium}} head with hemispherical combustion chambers, two valves per cylinder, angled 90° and timed by directly acting, chain driven dual overhead camshafts. Fed by a <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettor,</b> it developed , {{sent to the}} rear wheels through a 4-speed all-synchromesh gearbox with a column-mounted shifter as on the 6C 2500.|$|E
500|$|All Tigers were {{fitted with}} a single Ford <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettor.</b> The {{compression}} ratio of the larger Mark II engine was increased from the 8.8:1 of the smaller block to 9.3:1. Other differences between the versions included upgraded valve springs (the 260 had developed a reputation for self-destructing if pushed beyond 5000rpm), an engine-oil cooler, an alternator instead of a dynamo, a larger single dry plate hydraulically operated clutch, wider ratio transmission, and some rear-axle modifications. There were also cosmetic changes: speed stripes instead of chrome strips {{down the side of}} the car, a modified radiator grille, and removal of the headlamp cowls. All Tigers were fitted with the same [...] wide steel disc bolt-on wheels as the Alpine IV, and Dunlop RS5 [...] cross-ply tyres. The lack of space in the Tiger's engine bay causes a few maintenance problems; the left bank of spark plugs is only accessible through a hole in the bulkhead for instance, normally sealed with a rubber bung, and the oil filter had to be relocated from the lower left on the block to a higher position on the right-hand side, behind the generator.|$|E
5000|$|Berlina (Tipo 818.000/001): 1963-64. A compact four-door saloon {{introduced}} in 1963 with a 1098 cc, single <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettor</b> engine producing [...] at 5800 rpm.|$|E
5000|$|Small {{numbers of}} Lada rally cars were built with [...] Wankel engines, {{fitted with a}} pair of Weber DCOE <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{overhead}} valve straight-six engine had a cast iron block and an aluminium cylinder head. While the 2300 engine was {{fitted with a}} single <b>twin-choke</b> downdraught <b>carburettor,</b> the more powerful 2300S used two <b>twin-choke</b> horizontal <b>carburettors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Giulietta was {{launched}} in November 1977. Two models were available: Giulietta 1.3, with an oversquare [...] 1357 cc engine, and Giulietta 1.6, with a [...] 1570 cc engine, both Alfa Romeo Twin Cam inline-fours fed by two <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In May 1978 the Sprint and [...] "ti" [...] got new engines, a [...] 1.3 (1,350 cc) and a [...] 1.5 (1,490 cc), {{both with}} a <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettor.</b> At {{the same time}} the Alfasud ti {{received}} cosmetic updates: bumpers from the Super, new rear spoiler on the boot lid, black wheel arch extensions and black front spoiler, and was upgraded to the revised interior of the Super. The 1.3 and 1.5 engines were soon made available alongside the 1.2 on the Giardinetta and Super, with a slightly lower output compared to the sport models, due to having a single-choke carburettor. In 1979 the Sprint was given a double <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettor</b> setup and became the Alfasud Sprint Veloce.|$|E
5000|$|The Abarth-tuned type 132 AC 4.000 1.8-litre, twin-cam {{engine was}} {{brought from the}} {{standard}} 118 to [...] by replacing the standard <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettor</b> with double vertical twin-choke Weber 44 IDFs, and by fitting an Abarth exhaust with a dual exit muffler. The 9.8:1 compression ratio was left unchanged.|$|E
50|$|As on the Delta, the SOHC engines {{were derived}} from the Fiat Ritmo, revised by Lancia {{engineers}} with a Weber <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettor,</b> a new inlet manifold, exhaust system and ignition.On Fiat engines Lancia make their own aluminium heads and fuel injection systems, only some parts of Fiat {{can be used for}} restoration of Lancia i.e. engines.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} 275 GTB coupe {{was produced}} by Scaglietti and was available with 3 or 6 Weber <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettors.</b> It {{was more of a}} pure sports car than the GT name suggested. 80 cars were built with an aluminium body instead of the standard steel body. A Series Two version with a longer nose appeared in 1965.|$|R
2500|$|In 1950 a 6C 3000 engine {{from the}} prototypes was tuned for racing and {{installed}} in a 6C 2500 Competizione, which became the 6C 3000 C50. Being based on a 6C 2500 chassis, the car had a ladder frame with a [...] wheelbase, and a dry weight of [...] Three <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettors</b> and a raised compression ratio brought {{the output of the}} three-lithre straight six to [...]|$|R
5000|$|The Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint Speciale (also {{called as}} Giulietta SS, officially called Tipo 101.20, Italian for [...] "Type 101.20") was an {{aerodynamic}} 2-door, 2-seat coupé designed by Franco Scaglione at Bertone. 1.366 {{were made from}} 1957 to 1962. The car had a steel body, and {{was based on a}} short-wheelbase Giulietta chassis. It used a 1.3-litre engine brought to [...] thanks to double <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettors</b> and a high compression ratio.|$|R
5000|$|The {{improved}} ZMZ 24D, {{found in}} the GAZ 24, ran on 92 RON gasoline (while the ZMZ 24-01 could use commonly available 76 octane, and the 24-07 could use liquid propane). The cylinder block was die cast, instead of the slower coquille for the 21A. The engine featured a <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettor,</b> with a higher compression ratio, producing [...] at 4500 rpm and an even more impressive [...] of torque at 2200-2400 RPM.|$|E
50|$|The Trikappa was {{powered by}} a 4,594 cc Tipo 68 V8, with a bore and stroke of 75 mm and 130 mm. The engine {{featured}} a narrow 14° angle between the cylinder banks, and a single overhead camshaft and two parallel valves per cylinder. Fed by a Zenith <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettor,</b> it produced 98 hp at 2,500 rpm, allowing the Trikappa to reach {{a top speed of}} 130 km/h. The gearbox had four forward speeds and a triple-plate dry clutch.|$|E
5000|$|In November 1973 {{the first}} Alfasud sport model joined the range, the two-door Alfasud ti—(Turismo Internazionale, or Touring International). Along with a 5-speed gearbox, it {{featured}} {{a more powerful}} version of the 1.2 litre engine, brought to [...] by adopting a Weber <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettor,</b> allowing the small saloon to reach 160 km/h. Quad round halogen headlamps, special wheels, a front body-colour spoiler beneath the bumper and rear black one around the tail distinguished the [...] "ti", while inside there was a three-spoke steering wheel, auxiliary gauges, leatherette/cloth seats, and carpets in place of rubber mats.|$|E
50|$|Alongside saloon and estate models the 2300 range {{included}} Ghia-designed grand tourers, the Fiat 2300 Coupé and 2300S Coupé—the latter {{fitted with}} a more powerful engine fitted with double <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettors.</b> The shape of the car was first seen in public when Ghia presented it as a prototype sports coupé at the 1960 Turin Motor Show. A production version, based on the newly launched Fiat 2300 saloon was presented in 1961 and went on general sale in 1962. Having developed the coupé body, Ghia lacked the production capacity needed for the volumes envisaged, and were obliged to subcontract its production to OSI.|$|R
5000|$|In 1950 a 6C 3000 engine {{from the}} prototypes was tuned for racing and {{installed}} in a 6C 2500 Competizione, which became the 6C 3000 C50.

Three <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettors</b> and a raised compression ratio brought {{the output of the}} three-lithre straight six to [...]This one-off racing car was entered at the 1950 Mille Miglia with number 740, driven by Sanesi and Bianchi; the car did not finish the race, as the two had to withdraw near Ferrara.|$|R
5000|$|The 2.5 L (2484 cc) {{engine was}} {{initially}} available with <b>twin-choke</b> Weber <b>carburettors,</b> {{but in the}} last few years of production it was equipped with fuel injection. In both forms, it produced [...] @ 5400rpm and 208 Nm torque @ 3000rpm.|$|R
50|$|Like its predecessor, the three-litre engine had a {{cast iron}} block, an {{aluminium}} head with hemispherical combustion chambers, two valves per cylinder, angled 90° and timed by directly acting, chain driven dual overhead camshafts. Fed by a <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettor,</b> it developed , {{sent to the}} rear wheels through a 4-speed all-synchromesh gearbox with a column-mounted shifter as on the 6C 2500.The car used unit body construction, had a wheelbase of 3.05 m and a dry weight of 1,400 kg. The all-independent suspension was of the double wishbone type with coil springs upfront, and trailing arm type with transverse torsion bars at the rear.|$|E
50|$|The engines {{were all}} {{inline-four}} types, derived from {{those used in}} the outgoing 124 range, with a cast iron cylinder block and aluminium alloy cylinder head. Initially the 131 was offered only with pushrod valve gear, which offered the innovation of being the worldwide first engine with OHV valve gear and a belt driven camshaft. Only later in the model’s life came the well known double overhead camshaft (DOHC) engines which used a toothed timing belt. Fuel supply was via a single Weber ADF <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettor,</b> fed from a trunk mounted steel fuel tank. Traditional contact breaker ignition systems were used, usually with Marelli distributors.|$|E
5000|$|At launch {{two models}} were available, 33 1.3 and 33 1.5 Quadrifoglio Oro. [...] Both engines were SOHC boxers fed by a <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettor,</b> carried {{over from the}} Alfasud along with its 5-speed gearbox: a 1,350 cc {{developing}} [...] at 6,000 rpm, and a 1,490 cc developing [...] at 5,800 rpm. Unlike on the Alfasud, fifth gear acted like an overdrive gear and top speed was reached in fourth.The luxurious 1.5 Quadrifoglio Oro (Gold Cloverleaf in the UK) was distinguished by a silver grille, two-tone paintwork (metallic paint upper body separated by a brown tape from the dark brown lower body and bumpers) and clear front turn indicator lenses outside; by beige Texalfa leatherette/cloth interior, a woodtone steering wheel and shifter knob inside. Standard equipment included bronze tinted glass, headlight wipers, passenger side wing mirror and a trip computer.|$|E
5000|$|Competition {{versions}} of the 18R-G and -GE include those used in rally Celicas of the period, one of which {{finished second in the}} 1977 RAC Rally. These had four-valve heads and were called 152E, they were of 89 x 80 mm bore and stroke and 1,995 or 1,998 cc (depending on the source). The Group 4 rally version of the 152E had two <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettors,</b> and developed [...] at 9,000 rpm. Higher tuned engines developed as much as [...] at 9,200 rpm. German racing team Schnitzer also developed a turbocharged silhouette racing version of the Celica, to take on the Porsche 935. With a KKK turbocharger, the Group 5 Celica developed [...] but reliability was less than satisfactory.|$|R
5000|$|Berlina 2C (Tipo 818.100/101): 1964-69. Improved, more {{powerful}} Berlina launched late in 1963, with a [...] engine fitted with double <b>twin-choke</b> Solex <b>carburettors.</b> The body-shell also had revised front subframe mountings. Distinguished by an enamelled [...] "2C" [...] badge on the radiator grille and rear [...] "Fulvia 2C" [...] script.|$|R
5000|$|Another Quadrifoglio top of {{the range}} model, this time the {{sporting}} 1.5 Quadrifoglio Verde (Green Cloverleaf in the UK), was put on sale in June 1984. It was powered by a [...] version of the 1,490 cc boxer, equipped with double <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettors</b> like on the Sprint 1.5 QV coupé; Alfa Romeo claimed a top speed of over 185 km/h.The Quadrifoglio Verde could be recognized from its specific grille, additional plastic spoilers under both body-colour bumpers, side skirts, and grey 8-hole alloy wheels with low profile 185/60 HR14 tyres; it was only available in two paint colours—Alfa red or optional metallic silver—highlighted by a light grey stripe in the body side indent.In the cabin there were sport seats in black and grey cloth, a leather covered steering wheel and additional gauges for voltmeter and oil pressure.|$|R
5000|$|The car was {{powered by}} a [...] ZMZ-24D engine, an {{evolution}} of the ZMZ-21A. Retaining the basic OHV configuration, it now ran on 92 RON gasoline (while the ZMZ 24-01 could use commonly available 76 octane, and the 24-07 could use liquid propane). The cylinder block was die cast, instead of the slower coquille for the 21A. The engine featured a <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettor,</b> with a higher compression ratio, producing [...] at 4500 rpm and an even more impressive [...] of torque at 2200-2400 RPM. Transmission was now fully synchronised four on floor layout. The brakes were improved, with a hydraulic vacuum servo unit (a licence-built Girling PowerStop), {{as well as an}} independent parking brake (rather than transmission brake of the GAZ-21). At the same time, certain features were retained for their proven reliability, like the kingpin front suspension and recirculating ball steering.|$|E
5000|$|The Giulia 1300 {{marked the}} Giulia's {{entry in the}} then crowded 1.3-litre class, and {{featured}} simplified trim and equipment. It was introduced on 11 May 1964 at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza and produced until 1971, in left hand drive only.At first the Giulia 1300 was sold alongside the slightly cheaper Giulietta TI, {{the last of the}} outgoing 101-series Giulietta saloons, in its last year of production.In fact the Giulia used a twin cam engine derived from the Giulietta TI's. Equipped with a single Solex 32 PAIA 7 down-draft <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettor,</b> this updated 1,290 cc four-cylinder produced [...] or 89 SAE-rated PS at 6,000 rpm. Top speed was 155 km/h. A four-speed gearbox with floor change fitted as standard; the 1300 would remain the only Giulia model not fitted with a five-speed gearbox. Braking was by discs all around, without a servo at first, later with a servo.|$|E
50|$|The {{car that}} would become the Delta during its {{development}} went by the project codename Y 5, was conceived as an upmarket front-wheel drive small family car positioned below the larger Beta; an offering around four meters in length had been absent from Lancia's lineup since {{the demise of the}} Fulvia Berlina in 1973.Design was by Giorgetto Giugiaro's Italdesign. Its platform put together MacPherson suspension developed for the Beta with four-cylinder, SOHC engines derived from the Fiat Ritmo. The Fiat engines were revised by Lancia engineers with a Weber <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettor,</b> a new inlet manifold, exhaust system and ignition. To achieve its market positioning the Delta offered features uncommon in the segment, as fully independent suspension, rack and pinion steering, available air conditioning, optional split-folding rear seat, height-adjustable steering wheel, and defogger. Its three-piece body-coloured bumpers made from polyester resin sheet moulding compound were claimed by Lancia to be a first in the industry. The heating and ventilation were developed with help from Saab, experts in the field.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally both down-draft (DCNF & IDF) and side-draft (DCOE) <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettors</b> {{have been}} used to extract more power from the 128 derived engines. IDFs are rarely used due to an {{incorrect}} orientation of the float-bowls (causing possible surge/starve issues under cornering), the correctly orientated DCNF being the preferred down-draft carburettor in this application (also having a much lower profile than the IDF). For ultimate power the DCOE carburettor is used even though the float-bowl direction matches that of the IDF (i.e. incorrect). The aforementioned carburettors are usually used in pairs (effectively giving one independently tuneable carburettor per engine-cylinder), though applications where a single DCNF/DCOE are used to feed a shared manifold do exist. DCNF's tend to be either 36 mm or 40 mm, the larger 44-DCNF is deemed too large for the engine. Both 40-DCOE and 45-DCOE are commonly used where space allows.|$|R
5000|$|In April 1970 the sporty SS model arrived. Rather {{than the}} {{standard}} 2.5-liter model's [...] SAE (76.5 bhp net), the SS has [...] SAE at 4400 rpm, thanks to a <b>twin-choke</b> Weber <b>carburettor,</b> better breathing, and a performance exhaust system. The SS also received a chromed air cleaner and valve covers, a vinyl roof, twin exhaust tips, and other sporty embellishments.|$|R
5000|$|The two engines were {{developed}} from the units found in the 128 saloon and 128 Rally respectively, and both were fitted with <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettors</b> and a two-piece exhaust manifold. The 1100 (1,116 cc) produced [...] at 6,000 rpm and [...] Nm at 3,800 rpm, while the 1300 (1,290 cc) produced [...] at 6,600 rpm and [...] Nm at 3,800 rpm. Top speed was over 150 km/h and 160 km/h respectively.Compared with the 128 saloon, the coupé had a [...] cm shorter wheelbase (at 2223 mm), and tracks 20 mm wider at the front and 45 mm narrower at the rear.Suspension was the familiar all-independent 128 layout—save for the front anti-roll bar, which {{had been replaced by}} radius rods.The braking system consisted of discs at the front and drums at the rear; it was made more efficient by fitting smaller diameter front discs and the front and the vacuum servo first used on the 128 Rally.|$|R
50|$|All Tigers were {{fitted with}} a single Ford <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettor.</b> The {{compression}} ratio of the larger Mark II engine was increased from the 8.8:1 of the smaller block to 9.3:1. Other differences between the versions included upgraded valve springs (the 260 had developed a reputation for self-destructing if pushed beyond 5000 rpm), an engine-oil cooler, an alternator instead of a dynamo, a larger single dry plate hydraulically operated clutch, wider ratio transmission, and some rear-axle modifications. There were also cosmetic changes: speed stripes instead of chrome strips {{down the side of}} the car, a modified radiator grille, and removal of the headlamp cowls. All Tigers were fitted with the same 4.5 in wide steel disc bolt-on wheels as the Alpine IV, and Dunlop RS5 4.90 x 13 in cross-ply tyres. The lack of space in the Tiger's engine bay causes a few maintenance problems; the left bank of spark plugs is only accessible through a hole in the bulkhead for instance, normally sealed with a rubber bung, and the oil filter had to be relocated from the lower left on the block to a higher position on the right-hand side, behind the generator.|$|E
5000|$|In 1959 Fiat re-introduced an {{upmarket}} 1100 model, positioned {{between the}} standard saloon and the 1200 Granluce: the 1100 Lusso (type 103 H), {{also known as}} De luxe or Luxus on foreign markets.Based on the 1100 model 1958 bodyshell, the Lusso was distinguished by elaborate exterior trim. At the front {{for the first time}} on a 1100 the Fiat badge was moved from the bonnet to the centre of the grille, featuring a new square mesh radiator. The body-side chrome spear split in two to encompass a contrasting colour band (matching the roof paint) extended from the front doors to the end of the rear quarter panels, where there was a brass-plated ornament. The fuel filler cap was hidden under a lockable flap. There were new hubcaps, and the bumpers carried tall rubber-edged overriders. New interior features were a padded vinyl shelf added below the dashboard, and wind deflectors fixed to the front side windows.Thanks to a <b>twin-choke</b> <b>carburettor</b> and a higher 7.85:1 compression ratio the Lusso's 1.1-litre engine developed [...] (55 PS SAE), rather than the 43 PS CUNA of the model 1958 1100. Top speed was 130 km/h.Another change from the regular saloons was the two-piece propshaft, inherited from the TV saloons.|$|E
50|$|The Zagato was {{powered by}} a 430 hp (321 kW) V8 engine with <b>twin-choke</b> Weber <b>carburettors.</b> The all-alloy car could hit 300 km/h (186 mph). It was a luxurious car, with a price tag of US$156,600 at the time but with the high rarity and being {{released}} at the supercar price boom of 1987 to 1990, {{by the end of}} the decade, the car was changing hands for £450,000. The later convertible sold for $171,000.|$|R
5000|$|Fiat-Abarth OTS 1000 Coupe: {{introduced}} in April 1966. OTR 1000 bodyshell, but standard head OT 1000 engine with output upped to [...] and top speed to 160 km/h. FIA homologated {{it in the}} GT class in 1966. Abarth later developed several modifications, including a new inlet manifold for two <b>twin-choke</b> Solex <b>carburettors.</b> This {{gave birth to the}} OTSS 1000 or OT 1000 SS. Both OTS and OTSS were restyled in November 1968 like the OT 1000.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Merak's three-litre engine produced [...] at 6000 rpm and [...] at 4000 rpm. Three <b>twin-choke</b> Weber <b>carburettors</b> (one 42 DCNF 31 and two 42 DCNF 32) fed the engine, and {{the compression}} ratio was 8.75:1. Maserati declared {{a top speed}} of over 240 km/h.Early Meraks (1972 to 1975) were fitted with Citroën SM's dashboard, characterized by oval instrument gauges inset in a brushed metal fascia and a single-spoke steering wheel. 630 were made up to 1974.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{what made the}} GT special. Available in 3.7 L (3670 cc/223 in³) and 3.8 L (3750 cc/228 in³) versions, the engine had two sparkplugs per {{cylinder}} with two distributors and three <b>twin-choke</b> Weber <b>carburettors.</b> Modifications to the cylinder head brought compression to 9.0:1 and power output was 302 hp (225 kW). Maximum speed for the GT was 151 mph (243 km/h) with a 6.1 second sprint to 60 mph (97 km/h). It was the fastest road legal production car at the time.|$|R
