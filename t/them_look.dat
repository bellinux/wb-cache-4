5|$|The puffbirds {{are related}} to the jacamars and have the same range, but lack the {{iridescent}} colors of that family. They are mainly brown, rufous, or gray, with large heads and flattened bills with hooked tips. The loose abundant plumage and short tails makes <b>them</b> <b>look</b> stout and puffy, giving rise to the English common name of the family.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{work was}} put into {{creating}} a genuine and historically correct atmosphere for the film. The facades of the houses of Mirabeau had to be replaced with painted polystyrene, to make <b>them</b> <b>look</b> older, and all electric wires were put underground. Meanwhile, in Vaugines, Berri planted a dozen olive trees twelve months before filming started, and watered them throughout the waiting period, and for the second installment planted 10,000 carnations on the farm.|$|E
5|$|The three {{actors were}} given martial arts {{training}} ahead of filming. From August 1980, they were tutored by Kiyoshi Yamazaki, a karate black belt and master swordsman, who drilled them in sword-fighting styles that {{were meant to}} make <b>them</b> <b>look</b> proficient in using their weapons. They practiced each move in a fight at least 15times before filming. Yamazaki advised Leonard on the choreography of the sword fights and had a cameo role as one of Conan's instructors.|$|E

5|$|The trains {{were built}} in Goldau, Switzerland. CWA Constructions {{designed}} both the exterior and interior of the trains to make <b>them</b> <b>look</b> as faithful {{as possible to the}} Hogwarts Express seen in the Harry Potter film franchise. They are based on the steam locomotive GWR 4900 Class 5972 Olton Hall (as 5972 Hogwarts Castle) and were built from aluminum and glass-reinforced plastics. Afterwards, an artificial weathering process was applied to give the appearance of a historic train.|$|E
5|$|Albert Brooks guest {{starred in}} the episode {{as the voice of}} Cowboy Bob. He was not sure if he wanted to be {{identified}} with a cartoon show or not at the time, like many of the other early guest stars on The Simpsons, and was therefore credited as A. Brooks in the ending credits. This episode was a satire of the Bigfoot specials that had aired on the Fox network at the time when this episode was written. A lot of resources were spent on the backgrounds in the episode, trying to make <b>them</b> <b>look</b> realistic with many observational details such as trees, rocks, fences and the way the cars were positioned. Burger King figurines were made out of the camping designs of the Simpsons family in this episode.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} land carnivorans, bears are plantigrade. They {{distribute}} their weight toward the hind feet, which makes <b>them</b> <b>look</b> lumbering when they walk. They {{are capable of}} bursts of speed but soon tire, {{and as a result}} mostly rely on ambush rather than the chase. Bears can stand on their hind feet and sit up straight with remarkable balance. Their front paws are flexible enough to grasp fruit and leaves. Bears' non-retractable claws are used for digging, climbing, tearing, and catching prey. The claws on the front feet are larger than those on the back and may be a hindrance when climbing trees; black bears are the most arboreal of the bears, and have the shortest claws. Pandas are unique in having a bony extension on the wrist of the front feet which acts as a thumb, and is used for gripping bamboo shoots as the animals feed.|$|E

5|$|Females of the {{jumping spider}} Portia fimbriata have bodies 6.8 to 10.5millimetres long, while those of adult males are 5.2 to 6.5millimetres long. The Queensland variety is {{typically}} {{smaller than the}} Northern Territory variety. The cephalothorax is about 4millimetres long and 3millimetres wide, and the abdomen about 4millimetres long and 2.2millimetres wide. The front of the cephalothorax is large and angular, and the face is broad, high and flat. In Australia and Taiwan, both sexes have a generally dark brown carapace, reddish brown chelicerae ("jaws"), a brown underside, and dark brown palps with white hairs. Both sexes also have fine, faint markings and soft fringes of hair. However, the female has a white fringe just above the chelicerae, while the back half of the male's cephalothorax has a white band round the bottom edge and a white groove down the back. While male spiders' palps are larger than females', the palps of P.fimbriata females have a fringe of hair that makes <b>them</b> <b>look</b> about as larger as males'. The abdomens of both sexes are dark brown, with white spots on the upper side. Wanless' female from New Guinea has an orange carapace and chelicerae with sooty markings, palps mainly light yellow, legs orange-brown legs, and abdomen light yellow. Wanless also found a male from the Amboina area in Indonesia, showing an orange-brown carapace and chelicerae, yellow-brown to orange-brown palps, orange-brown legs and a light yellowish abdomen.|$|E

25|$|All {{episodes of}} Season 2 {{were used in}} the direct to video plot of the sequel, Tarzan and Jane, though some parts have been cut to make <b>them</b> <b>look</b> more like flashbacks. These episodes are {{believed}} to have happened sometime during or before Season 1, since some characters first appearances occurred in these episodes, the overall true specific order is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Many host {{governments of}} OFWs have {{protective}} policies and barriers {{making it difficult}} to enter the job market.

25|$|While most cryptozoologists {{recognize}} {{that at least}} some reports are simple misidentifications, they claim that many of the creatures described by those who have seen <b>them</b> <b>look</b> nothing like the known species put forward by skeptics and claim that certain reports stick out. For their part, the skeptics remain unconvinced, pointing out that {{even in the absence of}} outright hoaxes, imagination has a way of twisting and inflating the slightly out-of-the-ordinary until it becomes extraordinary.|$|E

25|$|The Sesame Street Muppets {{characters}} Bert and Ernie {{share their}} names with the cop and the taxicab {{driver in the}} film. Longtime Muppets writer and puppeteer Jerry Juhl said he believed there was no connection {{and that this was}} a coincidence. The episode Elmo Saves Christmas (1996), which featured a clip from the film, pokes fun at the persistent reports of a connection, having <b>them</b> <b>look</b> at each other in disbelief as George calls Bert and Ernie by name.|$|E
25|$|In the Coloured Shoin teahouse Sen no RikyÅ« stained the timbers with {{a mixture}} of Bengal red dye and black dye to make <b>them</b> <b>look</b> sooty and old. In contrast, his student's Oribe and Enshu {{preferred}} brighter colours and natural finishes. It is thought that this change coincided with the development of the regular wood plane that allowed a more consistent finish to wood and a better appreciation of the natural qualities of unfinished wood. It is a trait that has characterised the sukiya style since.|$|E
25|$|Pernkopf {{instructed}} them {{to paint}} the organs they saw in as much detail as possible, to make <b>them</b> <b>look</b> like living tissue in print. This was enabled by a special treatment of the paper used for watercolor images that allowed greater detail than that type of paint normally did. The only deviation from this high level of realism {{was the use of}} color, where Pernkopf instructed them to use brighter hues than those found in real cadavers so that a reader would better learn to recognize and distinguish key anatomical landmarks.|$|E

25|$|Since Islam reached {{them much}} after Altishahr, {{personal}} names of non-Islamic Old Uyghur origin are still used in Qumul and Turfan while people in Altishahr use mostly Islamic names of Persian and Arabic origin. After {{the establishment of}} the Soviet Union, many Uyghurs who studied in Soviet Central Asia added Russian suffixes to Russify their surnames and make <b>them</b> <b>look</b> Russian. Names from Russia and Europe are used in Qaramay and Urumchi by part of the population of city-dwelling Uyghurs. Others use names with hard to understand etymologies, with the majority dating from the Islamic era and being of Persian or Arabic derivation.|$|E
25|$|In oil refineries, natural-gas processing, {{petrochemical}} {{and chemical}} plants. Centrifugal compressors for such uses are often one-shaft multi-stage and driven by large steam or gas turbines. Their casings are often termed horizontally split or barrel. Standards {{set by the}} industry (ANSI/API, ASME) for these compressors result in large thick casings to maximize safety. The impellers are often if not always of the covered style which makes <b>them</b> <b>look</b> much like pump impellers. This type of compressor is also often termed API-style. The power needed to drive these compressors is most often in the thousands of HP. Use of real gas properties is needed to properly design, test and analyze their performance.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Grand Central Railway took an {{interest}} in the stored power cars and amalgamated them into its fleet of three HST sets. In total, 43065/067/068/080/084/123 were bought by the company and now run high-speed services between Sunderland and London Kings Cross. HSTs 43084 and 43123 were the final operational Paxman Valenta power cars, being re-engined in 2010 with the MTU treatment. While at the works being re-engined, Grand Central added the orange stripe that appears on its Class 180 units, re-painted the front ends (making <b>them</b> <b>look</b> more like the non-buffered HSTs), and re-numbered the power cars into the four-hundreds. These are the current numbers: 43465 (065)/467 (067)/468 (068)/480 (080)/484 (084)/423 (123).|$|E
