5|$|As {{part of the}} {{promotion}} for the event, Hogan appeared on Hot Properties four days prior to WrestleMania, where he put host Richard Belzer into a front chinlock —a move that cuts off <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> to the brain. Belzer, however, {{fell to the floor}} unconscious and began to bleed profusely. His injury required eight stitches. Belzer later sued Hogan for $5million, but they eventually settled out of court. The night before WrestleMania, Hogan and Mr. T hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live to help promote the event.|$|E
5|$|On February 4, 2015 it was {{revealed}} that during the recording of their main TV show on January 28, a 12-year-old member (name withheld) of Japanese all-girl singing group 3B Junior suffered from air embolism, losing consciousness and falling in a coma as a result of air bubbles blocking <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> to the brain, after inhaling huge quantities of helium as part of a game. The incident was not made public until a week later. The staff of TV Asahi held an emergency press conference to communicate that the member had been taken to the hospital and is showing signs of rehabilitation such as moving eyes and limbs, but her consciousness has not been sufficiently recovered as of yet. Police have launched an investigation due to a neglect of safety measures.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{conserve}} heat {{by reducing}} <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> to their skin and lose heat by evaporation through their mouths. Cats have minimal ability to sweat, with glands located primarily in their paw pads, and pant for heat relief only {{at very high}} temperatures (but may also pant when stressed). A cat's body temperature does not vary throughout the day; {{this is part of}} cats' general lack of circadian rhythms and may reflect their tendency to be active both during the day and at night. Cats' feces are comparatively dry and their urine is highly concentrated, both of which are adaptations to allow cats to retain as much water as possible. Their kidneys are so efficient, they can survive on a diet consisting only of meat, with no additional water, and can even rehydrate by drinking seawater. While domestic cats are able to swim, they are generally reluctant to enter water as it quickly leads to exhaustion.|$|E

5|$|For the 1979 season, Youngblood had {{a career-high}} 18 sacks {{and was a}} {{consensus}} first-team All-Pro for the fifth time. He was voted to his seventh consecutive Pro Bowl. In 1980, he was second-team All-Pro and first-team All-NFC while leading the Rams with 11½ sacks. In 1981, Youngblood led the Rams with 12½ sacks and was the Rams outstanding defensive lineman. In the off-season, prior to the 1981 season, Jack had emergency surgery to remove a hot-dog sized blood clot from under his left arm. It {{was a result of}} repeated trauma to a nerve in his arm that blocked <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> Despite the broken leg and numerous other injuries, Youngblood played in 201 consecutive games, a Rams team record; and only missed one game in his 14-year NFL career. He played in seven straight Pro Bowls, five NFC Championships, and one Super Bowl. He was also the Rams' defensive captain from 1977 through 1984 and was voted the Dan Reeves award 3 times, which is awarded to the team's MVP. He had 151½ career sacks and led the Rams in sacks nine times despite playing first in assistant Coach Ray Malavasi's stop-the-run-first defensive scheme and then in his final two seasons in Defensive Coordinator Fritz Shurmur's 3-4 two-gap scheme which limited some pass rush opportunities to make sure the opponent's running game was handled.|$|E

25|$|In an aortic dissection, blood penetrates the intima {{and enters}} the media layer. The high {{pressure}} rips the tissue of the media apart along the laminated plane splitting the inner two-thirds and the outer one-third of the media apart. This can propagate {{along the length of}} the aorta for a variable distance forward or backwards. Dissections that propagate towards the iliac bifurcation (with <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood)</b> are called anterograde dissections and those that propagate towards the aortic root (opposite of <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood)</b> are called retrograde dissections. The initial tear is usually within 100mm of the aortic valve, so a retrograde dissection can easily compromise the pericardium leading to a hemopericardium. Anterograde dissections may propagate all the way to the iliac bifurcation of the aorta, rupture the aortic wall, or recanalize into the intravascular lumen leading to a double-barrel aorta. The double-barrel aorta relieves the pressure of blood flow and reduces the risk of rupture. Rupture leads to hemorrhaging into a body cavity, and prognosis depends on the area of rupture. Retroperitoneal and pericardial ruptures are both possible.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the continual}} bleeding, {{the woman would}} have been {{continually}} regarded in Jewish law as a niddah or menstruating woman, and so ceremonially unclean.

Because of the constant bleeding, this woman lived in a continual state of uncleanness which would have brought upon her social and religious isolation.|$|E

25|$|They excrete two {{chemicals}} that {{aid in the}} body's defenses: histamine and heparin. Histamine is responsible for widening blood vessels and increasing <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> to injured tissue. It also makes blood vessels more permeable so neutrophils and clotting proteins can get into connective tissue more easily. Heparin is an anticoagulant that inhibits blood clotting and promotes the movement of white blood cells into an area. Basophils can also release chemical signals that attract eosinophils and neutrophils to an infection site.|$|E
25|$|In {{absence of}} {{external}} interventions, {{the umbilical cord}} occludes physiologically shortly after birth, explained both by a swelling and collapse of Wharton's jelly {{in response to a}} reduction in temperature and by vasoconstriction of the blood vessels by smooth muscle contraction. In effect, a natural clamp is created, halting <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> In air at 18°C, this physiological clamping will take three minutes or less. In water birth, where the water temperature is close to body temperature, normal pulsation can be 5 minutes and longer.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, 45% of the 250,000 valve {{replacement}} procedures performed annually involve a mechanical valve implant. The {{most widely used}} valve is a bileaflet disc heart valve, or St. Jude valve. The mechanics involve two semicircular discs moving back and forth, with both allowing <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> {{as well as the}} ability to form a seal against backflow. The valve is coated with pyrolytic carbon, and secured to the surrounding tissue with a mesh of woven fabric called Dacron (du Pont's trade name for polyethylene terephthalate). The mesh allows for the body's tissue to grow while incorporating the valve.|$|E

25|$|Amulets in general, {{were very}} popular. They were worn for many magical purposes. Health related amulets are {{classified}} as homeopoetic, phylactic and theophoric. Homeopoetic amulets portray an animal or part of an animal, from which the wearer hopes to gain positive attributes like strength or speed. Phylactic amulets protected against harmful gods and demons. The famous Eye of Horus was often used on a phylactic amulet. Theophoric amulets represented Egyptian gods; one represented the girdle of Isis and was intended to stem <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> at miscarriage. They were often made of bone, hanging from a leather strap.|$|E
25|$|Newer {{functional}} neuroimaging techniques include functional {{magnetic resonance}} imaging and positron emission tomography, both of which track <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> through the brain. These technologies provide more localized information about activity in the brain and create representations of the brain with widespread appeal. They also provide insight which avoids the classic problems of subjective self-reporting. It remains challenging to draw hard conclusions about where in the brain specific thoughts originate—or even how usefully such localization corresponds with reality. However, neuroimaging has delivered unmistakable results showing the existence of correlations between mind and brain. Some of these draw on a systemic neural network model rather than a localized function model.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{necessary}} for the woman to witness <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> itself; it is sufficient for her to notice a stain that has indications of having originated in her womb; bloodstains alone are inadequate without such evidence, for example, if she finds a stain just after cutting her finger, she does not become a niddah, as the blood is not obviously uterine. If she notices a bloodstain of uncertain origin, for example on her underclothing, there {{are a series of}} complicated criteria used by rabbinical law to determine whether she is niddah or not; the woman herself is not expected to know these criteria, and must seek the assistance of a rabbi.|$|E

25|$|A lack {{of oxygen}} or {{chemical}} changes in the lungs may cause the heart to stop beating. This cardiac arrest stops <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> and thus stops the transport of oxygen to the brain.

The brain cannot survive long without oxygen and the continued {{lack of oxygen}} in the blood combined with the cardiac arrest will lead to the deterioration of brain cells causing first brain damage and eventually brain death from which recovery is generally considered impossible. The brain will die after approximately six minutes without oxygen at normal body temperature, but hypothermia of the central nervous system may prolong this.|$|E
25|$|A tampon is {{a mass of}} {{absorbent}} material into a body cavity or wound to absorb bodily fluid. The most common type in daily use is disposable and designed to be inserted into the vagina during menstruation to absorb <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> The ancient Egyptians first invented disposable tampons made of softened papyrus around 2500 B.C. The ancient Greeks followed this with tampons made from lint wrapped around {{a small piece of}} wood. But it was not until 1929 that Earle Haas of Denver, Colorado first invented the modern tampon with an applicator. Dr. Haas submitted the design for patent in 1931, and in 1936, the tampon was first sold in the United States. He later gave his invention the brandname Tampax, which {{is still one of the}} main tampon brands today.|$|E
25|$|Uterine artery {{embolization}} (UAE) is a {{minimally invasive}} procedure for treatment of uterine fibroids. Under local anesthesia a catheter is introduced into the femoral artery at the groin and advanced under radiographic control into the uterine arterty. A mass of microspheres or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) material (an embolus) is injected into the uterine arteries in order to block <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> through those vessels. The restriction in blood supply usually results in significant reduction of fibroids and improvement of heavy bleeding tendency. The 2012 Cochrane review comparing hysterectomy and UAE {{did not find any}} major advantage for either procedure. While UAE is associated with shorter hospital stay and a more rapid return to normal daily activities, it was also associated with a higher risk for minor complications later on. There were no differences between UAE and hysterectomy with regards to major complications.|$|E
50|$|The {{malignant}} tumors of {{the heart}} have a worse prognosis.
