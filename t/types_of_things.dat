And my real father is into Mariah and Whitney and Aretha all those soulful singers. My mom is into more, like, adult contemporary—Celine Dion, Barbra , Bette , all those <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> And then my brother is a big influence on me. He's like 10 years older than me, so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so I grew up loving Guns N' Roses. I was all about Metallica. I was all about all those bands, and I still am. I love Aerosmith and No Doubt. I have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I could listen to her all the time.|$|E

Different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> {{that could be seen}} within LARPs are; bows, crossbows, siege weapons, thrown weapons, , NERF guns, paintball guns, and Airsoft guns. Ranged weapons can fit into every combat system except the 'No-Touch' system. There are LARPs that are ranged combat only, although a majority of the rules widely vary, a majority of ranged only LARPs follow the base rule of one hit kill.|$|E
500|$|The {{writing of}} the album did not start until a year after La Dispute's debut album, Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair, was released. Part {{of the reason for}} the delay was the band's {{continuous}} touring and promotion of the debut across the United States and Canada, with rare tour and festival appearances in Europe and Australia. When commenting on the delay between the band's album releases, singer Jordan Dreyer said he {{and the rest of the}} band members require [...] "an absurdly long gestation period with these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> and then we have to really sit down and be as meticulous as we all want to be". The band decided to use lyrical elements that they had intended to use in the first album but that were not included because they did not seem fully developed at the time. While writing La Dispute, the band had very specific goals; they projected the album to have 14 tracks and knew exactly what they wanted from each song.|$|E

500|$|Within {{the various}} {{uses of the}} word today, [...] "nature" [...] often refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, {{and in some cases}} to the {{processes}} associated with inanimate objects–the way that particular <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth. It is often taken to mean the [...] "natural environment" [...] or wilderness–wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, [...] "human nature" [...] or [...] "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind. Depending on the particular context, the term [...] "natural" [...] might also be distinguished from the [...] or the supernatural.|$|E
500|$|Gangsta rap {{has been}} criticized for its extreme lyrics, which are often accused of glamorizing gang {{violence}} and black-on-black crime. The Gangsta rappers responded that they were simply describing the realities of life in places such as Compton, California, and Long Beach, California. Describing Doggystyle in 1993, Snoop Doggy Dogg likewise points to the album's realism, {{and the extent to which}} it is based on his personal experience. [...] He said, [...] "I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only what I know and that's that street life. It's all everyday life, reality." [...] Explaining his intentions, Snoop Doggy Dogg claims he feels he is a role model to many young black men, and that his songs are designed to relate to their concerns. [...] "For little kids growing up in the ghettos," [...] he said, [...] "it's easy to get into the wrong <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> especially gangbanging and selling drugs. I've seen what that was like, and I don't glorify it, but I don't preach. I bring it to them rather than have them go find out about it for themselves." [...] He further explained the [...] "dream" [...] that he would pursue after making the album: [...] "I'm going to try to eliminate the gang violence. I'll be on a mission for peace. I know I have a lot of power. I know if I say, 'Don't kill', niggas won't kill".|$|E
2500|$|The {{theory of}} Forms (or theory of Ideas) {{typically}} {{refers to the}} belief that the material world as it seems to us is not the real world, but only an [...] "image" [...] or [...] "copy" [...] of the real world. In some of Plato's dialogues, this is expressed by Socrates, who spoke of forms in formulating {{a solution to the problem}} of universals. The forms, according to Socrates, are archetypes or abstract representations of the many <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> and properties we feel and see around us, that can only be perceived by reason (...) [...] (That is, they are universals.) In other words, Socrates was able to recognize two worlds: the apparent world, which constantly changes, and an unchanging and unseen world of forms, which may be the cause of what is apparent.|$|E

2500|$|According to Mike Johnson of PWInsider, Dolph Ziggler {{received}} a concussion from a stiff clothesline by Reeves in a January 2014 match, with Johnson reporting that this damaged Reeves's reputation among peers along with ongoing complaints of his recklessness – {{a reason why}} his recent pushes were aborted. In November 2014, CM Punk labelled Reeves as a [...] "steroid guy" [...] and said that wrestling him [...] "took 20 years off" [...] his life, while also claiming that Reeves purposely broke his ribs. Reeves denied {{the notion that he}} is a hazardous wrestler, and claimed {{that he would not be}} placed in matches with top WWE stars if he were as unsafe as some have claimed. Veteran wrestler Chris Jericho also dismissed the allegations of dangerous in-ring performance directed at Reeves, saying: [...] "Having worked with , I've never seen those <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>things...</b> it was always fun".|$|E
2500|$|Aristotle later {{created a}} {{systematic}} programme of philosophy which was teleological: Motion and change {{is described as}} the actualization of potentials already in things, according to what <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> they are. In his physics, the sun goes around the earth, and many things have {{it as part of}} their nature that they are for humans. Each thing has a formal cause, a final cause, and a role in a cosmic order with an unmoved mover. While the Socratics insisted that philosophy should be used to consider the practical question of the best way to live for a human being (a study Aristotle divided into ethics and political philosophy), they did not argue for any other types of applied science. Aristotle maintained that man knows a thing scientifically [...] "when he possesses a conviction arrived at in a certain way, and when the first principles on which that conviction rests are known to him with certainty".|$|E
2500|$|Simcha Jacobovici, {{involved}} {{in the production of}} a documentary on Freund's work for the National Geographic Channel, stated that the biblical Tarshish (which he believes is the same as Tartessos) was Atlantis, and that [...] "Atlantis was hiding in the Tanach". Aren Maeir, a professor of archeology at Bar-Ilan University said [...] "a lot of people have made many crazy claims about Atlantis – it’s one of those classic places where you have a lunatic fringe looking for all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> And Richard Freund is known as someone who makes 'sensational' finds. I would say that I am exceptionally skeptical about the thing, but I wouldn’t discount it 100% until I see the details, which haven’t been published as far as I know...every few years we hear something like this from him... And the fact that it’s on National Geographic doesn’t mean much. Unfortunately, over the past years they’ve had many questionable programs.".|$|E

2500|$|As a {{precursor}} to the Age of Enlightenment, Newton and Leibniz succeeded in developing a new physics, now referred to as classical mechanics, which could be confirmed by experiment and explained using mathematics. Leibniz also incorporated terms from Aristotelian physics, but now being used in a new non-teleological way, for example, [...] "energy" [...] and [...] "potential" [...] (modern versions of Aristotelian [...] "energeia and potentia"). This implied {{a shift in the}} view of objects: Where Aristotle had noted that objects have certain innate goals that can be actualized, objects were now regarded as devoid of innate goals. In the style of Francis Bacon, Leibniz assumed that different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> all work according to the same general laws of nature, with no special formal or final causes for each type of thing. It is during this period that the word [...] "science" [...] gradually became more commonly used to refer to a type of pursuit of a type of knowledge, especially knowledge of nature— coming close in meaning to the old term [...] "natural philosophy." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is a {{complicated}} task for admissions staff at selective colleges to analyze and process thousands of applications with a [...] "huge mail deluge" [...] since there are often six pieces of mail for each applicant, including transcripts, letters of recommendation, and the application itself. College admissions personnel spend less time on average reading each particular application; in 2009, the average admissions officer was responsible for analyzing 514 applications, and the trend was {{in the direction of}} officers having to read more and more applications. A typical college application receives only about 25 minutes of reading time, including three to five minutes for the personal essay if it is read. Advisors suggest that understanding some of the criteria can help an applicant apply to colleges with greater success. Some colleges extract information from the federal FAFSA financial aid form, including names of other schools the applicant is applying to. Counselors urge students and parents to understand what <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> colleges tend to look for in applications, and plan accordingly. A key attribute admissions evaluators look for, according to Mamlet and Vandevelde, is authenticity—a real person who comes through the application, not a packaged artificial entity or distortion crafted to impress an admissions officer. An admissions officer at Vanderbilt University wrote about how their office evaluates applicants: [...] "It's really about, 'What did I take advantage of in the environment I was given.'" [...] Several reports suggested that colleges were not looking for the [...] "well-rounded kid" [...] but rather a [...] "well-rounded class": ...|$|E
2500|$|After the June 5 sentencing, Walton {{said he was}} {{inclined}} to jail Libby after the defense laid out its proposed appeal, but the judge told attorneys he was open to changing his mind"; however, on June 14, 2007, Walton ordered Libby to report to prison while his attorneys appealed the conviction. [...] Libby's attorneys asked that the order be stayed, but Walton denied the request and told Libby {{that he would have}} 10 days to appeal the ruling. In denying Libby's request, which had questioned Fitzgerald's authority to make the charges in the first place, Walton supported Fitzgerald's authority in the case. He said: [...] "Everyone is accountable, and if you work in the White House, and if it's perceived that somehow (you're) linked at the hip, the American public would have serious questions about the fairness of any investigation of a high-level official conducted by the attorney general." [...] The judge was also responding to an Amicus curiae brief that he had permitted to be filed, which had not apparently convinced him to change his mind, as he subsequently denied Libby bail during his appeal. His [...] "order grant the [...] scholars permission to file their brief..." [...] contained a caustic footnote questioning the motivation of the legal academics and suggesting he might not give a great deal of weight to their opinion ... It is an impressive show of public service when twelve prominent and distinguished current and former law professors are able to amass their collective wisdom in the course of only several days to provide their legal expertise to the court on behalf of a criminal defendant. The Court trusts that this is a reflection of these eminent academics' willingness in the future to step to the plate and provide like assistance in cases involving any of the numerous litigants, both in this Court and throughout the courts of this nation, who lack the financial means to fully and properly articulate the merits of their legal positions even in instances where failure to do so could result in monetary penalties, incarceration, or worse. The Court will certainly not hesitate to call for such assistance from these luminaries, as necessary in the interests of justice and equity, whenever similar questions arise in the cases that come before it." [...] Moreover, when the hearing started, [...] "in the interest of full disclosure," [...] Walton informed the court that he had [...] "received a number of harassing, angry and mean-spirited phone calls and messages.

This shows the difficulty that actual performances pose to overly rigid conceptions of music.
