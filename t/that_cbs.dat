40|$|The Ca 2 +-binding protein calbindin D 28 k (CB) {{is vital}} for the normal {{function}} of {{the central nervous system}} but its specific functional role is largely unclear. CB is typically described as a mobile Ca 2 +buffer that shapes the spatiotemporal extent of cellular Ca 2 +signals. Recent biochemical data, however, indicate <b>that</b> <b>CB</b> also has characteristics of a Ca 2 + sensor and activates myo-inositol monophosphatase (IMPase), a key enzyme of the inositol- 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate signaling cascade and an assumed target of mood-stabilizing drugs in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Here, we show <b>that</b> <b>CB</b> interacts with IMPase in cerebellar Purkinje neurons, a cell type well known to rely on inositol- 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate-dependent synaptic integration. Quantification of the mobility of dye-labeled CB with two-photon fluorescence recovery after photobleaching revealed that a substantial fraction of CB is immobilized in spines and dendrites, but not in axons. Immobilization occurs over several seconds, is increased by suprathreshold synaptic activity, and can be relieved by a synthetic peptide that resembles the putative CB-binding site of IMPase, indicating <b>that</b> <b>CB</b> binds to immobilized IMPase. Measurements of the apparent diffusion coefficients of <b>CB</b> imply <b>that</b> <b>CB</b> does not interact with cytosolic IMPase or that the latter is present only in minute amounts in the spiny dendrites of Purkinje neurons.

40|$|It is {{recognized}} that endogenous cannabinoids, which signal through CB 1 receptors in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), exert a profibrotic effect on chronic liver diseases. In this study, we suppressed CB 1 expression by lentivirus mediated small interfering RNA (CB 1 -RNAi-LV) and investigated {{its effect on}} hepatic fibrosis in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>CB</b> 1 -RNAi-LV significantly inhibited CB 1 expression, and suppressed proliferation and extracellular matrix production in HSCs. Furthermore, CB 1 -RNAi-LV ameliorated dimethylnitrosamine induced hepatic fibrosis markedly, which {{was associated with the}} decreased expression of mesenchymal cell markers smooth muscle α-actin, vimentin and snail, and the increased expression of epithelial cell marker E-cadherin.

Our study firstly provides the evidence <b>that</b> <b>CB</b> 1 -RNAi-LV might ameliorate hepatic fibrosis through the reversal of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), while the CB 1 antagonists AM 251 had no effect on epithelial-mesenchymal transitions of HSCs.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the role of CB 1 receptor signaling in angiogenesis and the therapeutic exploitation of CB 1 inactivation as an antiangiogenic strategy. We started from the observation <b>that</b> <b>CB</b> 1 receptor expression is induced during angiogenesis and that the endocannabinoid anandamide stimulated bFGF-induced angiogenesis in the nanomolar physiologic range. To define the functional involvement of CB 1 receptor signaling during angiogenesis, 2 different strategies have been carried out: siRNA-mediated knockdown and pharmacologic antagonism of CB 1 receptors. CB 1 receptors inactivation resulted in the inhibition of bFGF-induced endothelial proliferation, migration, and capillary-like tube formation, through prosurvival and migratory pathways involving ERK, Akt, FAK, JNK, Rho, and MMP- 2. To corroborate the potential therapeutic exploitation of CB 1 blockade as an antiangiogenic strategy, we performed in vivo assays founding <b>that</b> <b>CB</b> 1 blockade was able to inhibit bFGF-induced neovascular growth in the rabbit cornea assay. A relevant finding was the ability to reduce ocular pathologic neo-vascularization in mouse oxygen-induced retinopathy. These results demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>CB</b> 1 signaling participates to the proliferative response elicited by proangiogenic growth factors in angiogenesis and that for this reason CB 1 receptor could represent a novel target {{for the treatment of}} diseases where excessive neoangiogenesis is the underlying pathology...|$|R
40|$|In {{developing}} brain neuronal migration, dendrite outgrowth and {{dendritic spine}} outgrowth {{are controlled by}} Cdc 42, a small GTPase of the Rho family, and its activators. Cdc 42 function in promoting actin polymerization is crucial for glutamatergic synapse regulation. Here, we focus on GABAergic synapse-specific activator of Cdc 42, collybistin (CB) and examine functional differences between its splice isoforms CB 1 and CB 2. We report <b>that</b> <b>CB</b> 1 and CB 2 differentially regulate GABAergic synapse formation in vitro along proximal-distal axis and adult-born neuron maturation in vivo. The functional specialization between CB 1 and CB 2 isoforms arises from their differential protein half-life, in turn regulated by ubiquitin conjugation of the unique CB 1 C-terminus. We report <b>that</b> <b>CB</b> 1 and CB 2 negatively regulate Cdc 42; however, Cdc 42 activation is dependent on CB interaction with gephyrin. During hippocampal adult neurogenesis CB 1 regulates neuronal migration, while CB 2 is essential for dendrite outgrowth. Finally, using mice lacking Gabra 2 subunit, we show <b>that</b> <b>CB</b> 1 function is downstream of GABA(A) Rs, and we can rescue adult neurogenesis deficit observed in Gabra 2 KO.

40|$|Cannabinoid {{receptor}} 2 (CB 2 R) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) {{expressed in}} the periphery by immune cells, such as B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, macrophages and T cells. It belongs to the endocannabinoid system which also comprises CB 1 R, endogenous lipophilic agonists called endocannabinoids and the enzymes responsible for their synthesis and degradation. During inflammatory diseases the endocannabinoid system is dysregulated and increased expression levels of endocannabinoids and cannabinoid receptors are observed. Therefore there is a continuing interest to target the endocannabinoid system to restore homeostasis in {{patients who suffer from}} a number of inflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, atherosclerosis, neuropathic pain and others. However, to date there has been no good anti-inflammatory drug in the market or clinical trials <b>that</b> acts via <b>CB</b> 2 R. The main aim of this DPhil thesis was to critically assess the role of this receptor in health and inflammation with a particular focus on innate immune cell recruitment. Here I describe my findings regarding the immunophenotype of a CB 2 R knockout (KO) mouse strain at steady state and under acute systemic inflammation. I showed <b>that</b> <b>CB</b> 2 R KO mice display a trend in neutrophil accumulation and in monocyte egress in the bone marrow, as well as higher myeloperoxidase activity in the liver. These findings support the view that this cannabinoid receptor plays a pivotal role in innate immune cell trafficking during homeostasis. Furthermore, I discovered <b>that</b> <b>CB</b> 2 R KO animals display exacerbated immune cell recruitment to peripheral tissues in a model of low dose endotoxemia. In particular, I found more neutrophils in the lungs and spleens of CB 2 R KO mice at the modelâs peak time point. These observations are consistent with a model in which CB 2 R plays a non-redundant role in the inhibition of neutrophil migration to injured tissues after an inflammatory insult. My in vitro experiments showed <b>that</b> <b>CB</b> 2 R-selective agonists had no anti-inflammatory effects during macrophage activation. Looking for a mechanistic explanation for this result, I found that the expression levels of the receptor are severely downregulated upon challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) which suggests that it is possible <b>that</b> <b>CB</b> 2 R is differentially regulated in immune cells during inflammation. Collectively, the data presented in this thesis support the view <b>that</b> <b>CB</b> 2 R {{plays an important role in}} health and disease in pre-clinical models, but further studies are required to make more soluble CB 2 R-selective agonists and to understand which immune cells we should aim to target therapeutically. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Sepsis {{is a major}} {{healthcare}} {{problem and}} current estimates suggest {{that the incidence of}} sepsis is approximately 750, 000 annually. Sepsis is caused by an inability of the immune system to eliminate invading pathogens. It was recently proposed that endogenous mediators produced during sepsis can contribute to the immune dysfunction that is observed in sepsis. Endocannabinoids that are produced excessively in sepsis are potential factors leading to immune dysfunction, because they suppress immune cell function by binding to G-protein-coupled CB 2 receptors on immune cells. Here we examined the role of CB 2 receptors in regulating the host’s response to sepsis. Methods and Findings: The role of CB 2 receptors was studied by subjecting CB 2 receptor wild-type and knockout mice to bacterial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture. We report <b>that</b> <b>CB</b> 2 receptor inactivation by knockout decreases sepsis-induced mortality, and bacterial translocation into the bloodstream of septic animals. Furthermore, CB 2 receptor inactivation decreases kidney and muscle injury, suppresses splenic nuclear factor (NF) -kB activation, and diminishes the production of IL- 10, IL- 6 and MIP- 2. Finally, CB 2 receptor deficiency prevents apoptosis in lymphoid organs and augments the number of CD 11 b + and CD 19 + cells during CLP. Conclusions: Taken together, our results establish for the first time <b>that</b> <b>CB</b> 2 receptors are important contributors to septic immune dysfunction and mortality, indicating <b>that</b> <b>CB</b> 2 receptors may be therapeutically targeted for the benefit of patient...|$|R
