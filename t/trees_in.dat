5|$|Populations of C.australis were {{decimated}} in {{some parts}} of New Zealand because of Sudden Decline. In some areas, particularly in the north, no big trees are left. Although Sudden Decline often affects cabbage <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> farmland and open areas, <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> natural forest patches continue to do well. <b>Trees</b> <b>in</b> the southern North Island and northern South Island are generally unaffected with few dead branches and no symptoms of Sudden Decline. By 2010, there was evidence to suggest the severity of the disease was lessening.|$|E
