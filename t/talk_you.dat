25|$|Following an {{introductory}} {{meeting with the}} Office of District Government Matiari, the British schoolteachers visit several {{public schools in the}} vicinity, including one for children with mental disabilities. They discover that teaching styles are more direct in Pakistan, with an ‘I <b>talk,</b> <b>you</b> listen’ approach as opposed to ‘let us do it together’ that is used in the UK. One look at the children’s report cards, however, ascertains the effectiveness of this approach in the results that appear to be just as good. An emphasis on discipline surfaces as a common feature in all the individual opinions expressed, when inquired about the school visits.|$|E
500|$|Bushnell {{felt that}} Pong was {{especially}} significant in {{its role as}} a social lubricant, since it was multiplayer-only and did not require each player to use more than one hand: [...] "It was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say, 'I'd like to play Pong and there's nobody to play.' It was a way you could play games, you were sitting shoulder to shoulder, you could <b>talk,</b> <b>you</b> could laugh, you could challenge each other ... As you became better friends, you could put down your beer and hug. You could put your arm around the person. You could play left-handed if you so desired. In fact, {{there are a lot of}} people who have come up to me over the years and said, 'I met my wife playing Pong,' and that's kind of a nice thing to have achieved." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some women became picture brides in {{an attempt}} to escape {{familial}} duties. They thought that by leaving Japan or Korea they could get out of responsibilities such as filial piety that came along with traditional marriage. Some women thought that they would gain freedoms denied to them in Japan and Korea. A quote from a Korean picture bride named Mrs. K embodies the mindset of many picture brides traveling to Hawaii, [...] "Hawaii's a free place, everybody living well. Hawaii had freedom, so if you like <b>talk,</b> <b>you</b> can talk, if you like work, you can work." [...] With the influx of women becoming picture brides, some women followed the trend as the thing to do. As one Japanese picture bride, Motome Yoshimura, explained, [...] "I wanted to come to the United States because everyone else was coming. So I joined the crowd." ...|$|E
