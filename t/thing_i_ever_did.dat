500|$|Away from acting, Hawke {{directed}} the music video for the 1994 song [...] "Stay (I Missed You)," [...] by singer-songwriter Lisa Loeb, {{who was a}} member of Hawke's theater company at the time. In a 2012 interview, Hawke said that the song, which was included in Reality Bites, is the only number-one popular song by an unsigned artist in the history of music. He published his first novel in 1996, The Hottest State, about a love affair between a young actor and a singer. Hawke said of the novel, [...] "Writing the book had to do with dropping out of college, and with being an actor. I didn't want my whole life to go by and not do anything but recite lines. I wanted to try making something else. It was definitely the scariest <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did.</b> And it was just one of the best things I ever did." [...] The book met with a mixed reception. Entertainment Weekly said that Hawke [...] "opens himself to rough literary scrutiny in The Hottest State. If Hawke is serious... he'd do well to work awhile in less exposed venues." [...] The New York Times thought Hawke did [...] "a fine job of showing what it's like to be young and full of confusion", concluding that The Hottest State was ultimately [...] "a sweet love story".|$|E
2500|$|Although Lambert was not Newman's {{first choice}} {{to produce the}} series — Don Taylor and Shaun Sutton had both {{declined}} the position — he was very keen to ensure that Lambert took the job after his experience of working with her at ABC. [...] "I think the best <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> on that was to find Verity Lambert," [...] he told Doctor Who Magazine in 1993. [...] "I remembered Verity as being bright and, to use the phrase, full of piss and vinegar! She was gutsy and she used to fight and argue with me, {{even though she was}} not at a very high level as a production assistant." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Berlin, he insinuated {{himself into}} the Nazi Party and read Nazi propaganda, in {{particular}} Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf. Sorge attended so many beer halls with his new acquaintances that he gave up drinking {{so as not to}} say anything inappropriate. His abstinence from drinking did not make his Nazi companions suspicious. It was an example of his devotion to and absorption in his mission, as he was a heavy drinker. He later explained to Hede Massing, [...] "That was the bravest <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did.</b> Never will I be able to drink enough to make up for this time." [...] Later, his drinking came to undermine his work.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2012 - {{just before}} the 30th anniversary of the killing - and {{in the wake of}} a {{prominent}} retrospective article in the New York Times, Ebens expressed his contrition in a phone interview from his home in Nevada with writer Emil Guillermo, saying killing Chin was [...] "the only wrong <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> in my life.".|$|R

"Ay, richt ye are," [...] he said, in a {{voice that}} had become a child's; [...] "I hae muckle, muckle, to be thankfu' for, an' no the least is 'at baith me an' Jess has aye belonged to a bural society. We hae nae cause to be anxious aboot a' thing bein' dune re-respectable aince we're gone.

2500|$|Prior to the inquest, Neddy Smith {{was interviewed}} four times by four {{separate}} teams of detectives. He {{claims that he}} was at home with his wife the night Huckstepp was murdered. However, he was secretly recorded confessing to a cellmate at Long Bay Correctional Centre. He was recorded saying he had attacked Huckstepp from behind, punched her, grabbed her by the throat, lifted her off the ground and then strangled her for about six minutes. Smith then claimed he dragged her into the pond and stood on her back to keep her head submerged for a few more minutes. He was also recorded saying that [...] "strangling somebody is the hardest thing in the world...(but) the most satisfying <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> in my life". Smith later dismissed his confession as lies, saying he knew he was being taped and wanted the publicity for his new book, Catch and Kill Your Own. He is also alleged to have confessed to his publisher. Smith was subsequently charged in September 1996 with Huckstepp's murder and was committed to stand trial, but was acquitted in 1999. In an interview with writer John Dale, Smith claimed that Huckstepp was murdered because she kept [...] "bugging Roger, ringing him up and leaving messages that he was a dog...The reason they didn't bury her or dispose of the body was Roger wanted her left floating in the pond as a message. The bloke who killed her has never been arrested and is not in jail".|$|E

5000|$|Hamer won bronze at the Women’s U25 World Championships in St Catharines, Ontario in 2011, {{and silver}} at the Women’s U25 European Championships in 2013. She was {{also part of}} the team at the 2012 Paralympic Games in London. [...] "I think we may be at our best for Rio in 2016," [...] she teold reporters beforehand, [...] "but 2012 will be the biggest <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>do,</b> and <b>I</b> won't be able to play at a home Paralympics ever again." ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl smiled very faintly. “I {{am afraid}} it is,” she said. “Do you know, Tony, {{that this is}} the hardest <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> have <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> in my life?” ...|$|R
5000|$|In the end {{she married}} a New Zealander (the academic, Maurice Dodson) who would accept what she {{anticipated}} to be an international career. She initially thought motherhood was not for her, considering it to be [...] "de-skilling" [...] and incredibly difficult in Britain, where the system did not allow a woman to be both {{a mother and a}} worker. She was seven months pregnant before she realised her condition, but now considers her two children to be [...] "the best <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> in my life". She is a grandmother.|$|R
6000|$|Hetty trembled a little. [...] "It {{is going}} to be the hardest <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did.</b> He is just dreadful in his {{quietness}} when he is angry--and I would have to tell him I had been meeting Larry and sending him dollars. You know what he would fancy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Best <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> in my life," [...] Sir Henry agreed. [...] "Now see here, Jimmy. We'll sail out tomorrow, or {{take the}} motor boat, {{according}} to the wind. We'll enter Langley Shallows there and pass Dead Man's Rock {{on the left side}} of the waterway, and keep straight on until we get Budden Wood on the church tower. You follow me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you worry," [...] he answered, cheerfully. [...] "That's all right, anyway. It's jolly {{well the}} best <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> in my life. Got my pockets {{full of money}} already, and I mean to have a thundering good time with it. No fear of my ever blaming you. Good-night, Miss Edith! My regards to the {{governor}} and tell him I am all on for Menatogen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't go for to say I sailed {{there at}} all," [...] {{retorted}} Joe; [...] "I walked it partly, and went part o' {{the way on}} elephants an' horses, and went aloft o' them there mountains pretty nigh as far up as the main-topmast cross-trees of 'em; I've also slep' in the snow-huts of the Eskimos, an' bin tossed about in a'most every sort o' craft that swims, but wot I've got to say is this, {{that of all the}} <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> see, travellin' in Californy beats 'em all to sticks and stivers." ...|$|R

5000|$|In the 1985 film The Goonies, the {{character}} Chunk describes in detail his character's history with fake vomit: The worst <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> - <b>I</b> mixed {{a pot of}} fake puke at home and then I went to this movie theater, hid the puke in my jacket, climbed up to the balcony and then, t-t-then, I made a noise like this: hua-hua-hua-huaaaaaaa - and then I dumped it over the side, all over {{the people in the}} audience. And then, this was horrible, all the people started getting sick and throwing up all over each other. I never felt so bad in my entire life.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well! I {{have been}} thinking! Our {{marriage}} {{was the best}} and worst <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did.</b> It was unjust to you, and as bad as possible towards them; but that is what I can't be as sorry for as it deserves,' and he looked up with a sweet smile, fading at once--'except when I look at you and the children, and think what is to become of you.' ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. ERLYNNE. [Smiling.] The wisest <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> in my life. And, by the way, {{you must}} pay me {{a good deal of}} {{attention}} this evening. I am afraid of the women. You must introduce me to some of them. The men I can always manage. How do you do, Lord Augustus? You have quite neglected me lately. I have not seen you since yesterday. I am afraid you're faithless. Every one told me so.|$|E
6000|$|She nodded. [...] "Bravest <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did.</b> Nearly {{broke my}} 'eart {{to leave my}} baby; but 'twas that or drownin' myself. I was soft then. I went off with a young fellow--bookmaker that used {{to come over to}} the sports meetin', wild about me--but he never married me"--again she uttered her hard laugh--"knew a thing worth tu o' that." [...] Lifting her hand towards the burning furze, she added: [...] "I used to come up here an' help 'em light that when I was a little girl." [...] And {{suddenly}} she began to cry. It was not so painful and alarming as her first distress, for it seemed natural now.|$|E
5000|$|Writing {{that song}} {{is one of}} the hardest <b>things</b> <b>I</b> have <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> ... <b>I</b> wrote it and rewrote it and rewrote it {{throughout}} his therapy and he responded very well to the treatment so it became a song of hope and perseverance.|$|R
5000|$|During the song, Steve Miller {{references}} The Clovers' 1954 song [...] "Lovey Dovey" [...] when {{he sings}} [...] "You're the cutest <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> see / Really love your peaches, wanna shake your tree / Lovey dovey, lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time".|$|R
5000|$|In 1994, Weinstein {{travelled}} to Vienna, Austria {{where he}} served as a Junior Visiting Fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences (Insituut fuer die Wissenschaften vom Menschen/IWM). The fellowship lasted only six months, but he stayed in Vienna, playing guitar as a street musician for six months, before managing to get another fellowship at IWM. According to Weinstein, [...] "It was, by far, one of the best <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> learned so much about myself and the world from being outside of the country and by taking some time away from my academic trajectory to explore other interests." [...] He returned to the states to teach as an adjunct professor and finish his dissertation, [...] "Adam Smith and the Problem of Neutrality in Contemporary Liberal Theory." ...|$|R
60|$|It was, I think, {{the bravest}} <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did.</b> I felt, in doing it, as one feels who has nerved himself to enter fire. And when {{the thing was}} done, the ease of it {{surprised}} me. There followed no catastrophe such as I expected. Before my glance, grown suddenly so very bold, her own eyes drooped and fell away as was her habit. She spoke thereafter without looking at me, in that cold, emotionless voice that was peculiar to her always, the voice of one in whom the founts {{of all that is}} sweet and tolerant and tender in life are for ever frozen.|$|E
60|$|That second start was {{the most}} foolhardy <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did.</b> For it was {{manifest}} the Martians were about us. No sooner had the curate overtaken me than we saw either the fighting-machine we had seen before or another, far away across the meadows {{in the direction of}} Kew Lodge. Four or five little black figures hurried before it across the green-grey of the field, and in a moment it was evident this Martian pursued them. In three strides he was among them, and they ran radiating from his feet in all directions. He used no Heat-Ray to destroy them, but picked them up one by one. Apparently he tossed them into the great metallic carrier which projected behind him, much as a workman's basket hangs over his shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|The engine, {{or rather}} the engineer, had saved us: as the saying is, it was touch and go--the nearest <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> see. Had the rotten old boiler struck work for five minutes when we were {{clearing}} out of Tírán, or steaming along Sináfir shore, nothing could have kept the ship afloat. Those who behaved best, a fireman, a boy who crept into the combustion-chamber to clear it, and helmsman who, having been at Liverpool, spoke a little English, were duly [...] "bakhshísh'd." [...] The same reward was given by mistake to the boilermaker, Mohammed Sa'íd Haddád, who had malingered, instead of working, through the night. At Suez he had the impudence to ask me for a Shahádah ("testimony") to his good character. On the whole {{the conduct of the}} crew was worthy of all praise.|$|E
50|$|When I was a bachelor, I liv'd all aloneI {{worked at}} the weaver's tradeAnd the only, only <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> wrongWas to woo a fair young maid.I wooed her in the wintertimeAnd in the summer, tooAnd the only, only <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> did that was wrongWas {{to keep her from}} the foggy, foggy dew.|$|R
60|$|The {{sting of}} {{this was in the}} tone of her voice. It was the hardest <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> had to <b>do</b> in my life--but I did succeed in {{controlling}} myself.|$|R
5000|$|Lyrics from [...] "Lovey Dovey" [...] (particularly [...] "You're {{the cutest}} <b>thing,</b> That <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> see, <b>I</b> really love your peaches, Wanna shake your tree"), {{were used by}} Steve Miller in his 1974 chart-topping single [...] "The Joker". [...] "The Joker" [...] in turn was later sampled on another number one hit, [...] "Angel" [...] by Shaggy, giving Ahmet Ertegun credit as a {{songwriter}} on the latter.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have, perhaps, {{no great}} reason for setting {{too high a}} value on myself," [...] he said. [...] "What I am you know, but, if you must have plain talk, there were two men made the bargain that {{disposed}} of you. It cost me a big share of my possessions to satisfy your father, but he showed no unwillingness to take my cheque, {{and he would have}} taken Aylmer's could he have raised him high enough. Who was the lowest down, the Western farmer, who, at least, meant to be kind to you, or Branscombe Denham, who was willing to sell his daughter to the highest bidder? Still, you were right. It was, in one way, about the meanest <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did.</b> The blood was in my face when I made my offer--and your father smiled. By the Lord, if I'd made that proposition to any hard-up wheat-grower between here and Calgary, he'd have whipped me from his door." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's because I {{spent my}} own, I suppose," [...] said Morris. [...] "I frankly confess that. I have been wild. I have been foolish. I {{will tell you}} every crazy <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did,</b> if you like. There were some great follies among the number--I have never {{concealed}} that. But I have sown my wild oats. Isn't there some proverb about a reformed rake? I was not a rake, but I assure you I have reformed. It is better to have amused oneself {{for a while and}} have done with it. Your daughter would never care for a milksop; and I will take the liberty of saying that you would like one quite as little. Besides, between my money and hers there is a great difference. I spent my own; it was because it was my own that I spent it. And I made no debts; when it was gone I stopped. I don't owe a penny in the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{heart was}} near {{breaking}} wi' woe, but, oh, I was awid they shouldna ken it, and the bravest <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> was {{to sit through}} the supper that night, making muckle o' your father, looking fond-like at him, laughing at his coarse jokes, and secretly hating him down to my very marrow a' the time. The crowd got word o' the ongoings, and they took a cruel revenge. A carriage had been ordered for nine o'clock {{to take us to}} Tilliedrum, where we should get the train to London, and when we heard it, as we thought, drive up to the door, out we went, me on your father's arm laughing, but wi' my teeth set. But Aaron's words had put an idea into their heads, though he didna intend it, and they had got out the hearse. It was the hearse they had brought to the door instead of a carriage.|$|E
6000|$|... "Personally," [...] Geraldine observed, leaning {{a little}} forward {{to look at}} her, [...] "I think a {{destroyer}} {{is one of the}} most vicious, the most hideous <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> saw. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> hope that Ralph will be quick and get a cruiser." ...|$|R
5000|$|The duo's live {{performance}} of the song on the widely watched music programme Top of the Pops {{is often referred to}} as one of popular music's most embarrassing moments. [...] One journalist described it as [...] "... truly awful dad dancing and shocking lyrics" [...] while another opined, [...] "A timeless classic for all the wrong reasons ... You get the feeling that Waddle was rightly embarrassed to be there while Hoddle genuinely felt he was at the start of something big." [...] Chris Waddle later remembered the Top of the Pops performance as [...] "the most nerve-racking thing he'd ever done" [...] and stated that the duo had to appear on the programme in person as the producers had refused to air the accompanying music video because [...] "it was so bad." [...] In contrast, Hoddle recalled the appearance in a positive light, referred to it as [...] "One of the greatest <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> ... I'm glad <b>I</b> did it and I learnt a lot from it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You can't {{imagine what}} a funny feeling hanging gives you,' murmured the Shifty Lad, who looked rather purple {{in the face}} and spoke in an odd voice. 'I don't think you have every tried it, or you wouldn't have let me go up first. Why, it is the pleasantest <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> have <b>ever</b> <b>done.</b> <b>I</b> was shaking my legs from sheer delight, and if you had been there you would have shaken your legs too.' ...|$|R
