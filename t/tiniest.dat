5|$|Thom {{wished to}} examine whether or not prehistoric peoples used high-accuracy astronomy. He {{believed}} that by using horizon astronomy, observers could make estimates of dates in the year to a specific day. The observation required finding a place where on a specific date the sun set into a notch on the horizon. A common theme is a mountain which blocked the Sun, but on the right day would allow the <b>tiniest</b> fraction to re-emerge {{on the other side}} for a 'double sunset'. The animation below shows two sunsets at a hypothetical site, one the day before the summer solstice and one at the summer solstice, which has a double sunset.|$|E
25|$|England were shaken, {{with the}} score at 31 for 4, and with Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen at the crease. Pietersen could {{consider}} himself lucky to survive, after a suggestion {{he had been}} caught first ball. He survived, {{and went on to}} make 20, only to be given out off a similar situation from Shane Warne. His 41-run partnership with Bell steadied things somewhat, and there were hopes among England fans that Bell would make his first significant score against the tourists. Instead, he fell two overs after Pietersen, having given the <b>tiniest</b> of edges to Gilchrist for 21.|$|E
25|$|As {{related in}} chapter 2, Loki, under {{the service of}} Odin, found out about Freyja's actions and told Odin. Odin told Loki to get the {{necklace}} {{and bring it to}} him. Loki said that since no one could enter Freyja's bower against her will, this wouldn't be an easy task, yet Odin told him not to come back until he had found a way to get the necklace. Howling, Loki turned away and went to Freyja's bower but found it locked, and that he couldn't enter. So Loki transformed himself into a fly, and after having trouble finding even the <b>tiniest</b> of entrances, he managed to find a tiny hole at the gable-top, yet even here he had to squeeze through to enter.|$|E

25|$|For much of history, {{the modern}} {{understanding}} of extinction {{as the end}} of a species was incompatible with the prevailing worldview. Through the 18th century, much of Western society adhered to the belief that the world was created by God and as such was complete and perfect. This concept reached its heyday in the 1700s with the peak popularity of a theological concept called the Great Chain of Being, in which all life on earth, from the <b>tiniest</b> microorganism to God, is linked in a continuous chain. The extinction of a species was impossible under this model, as it would create gaps or missing links in the chain and destroy the natural order. Thomas Jefferson was a firm supporter of the Great Chain of Being and an opponent of extinction, famously denying the extinction of the wooly mammoth on the grounds that nature never allows a race of animals to become extinct.|$|E
25|$|Geomicrobiology {{traditionally}} {{studies the}} interactions between microbes and minerals. While it is generally reliant on the tools of microbiology, microbial geochemistry uses geological and chemical methods to approach the same topic {{from the perspective of}} the rocks. Geomicrobiology and microbial geochemistry (GMG) is a relatively new interdisciplinary field that more broadly takes on the relationship between microbes, Earth, and environmental systems. Billed as a subset of both geobiology and geochemistry, GMG seeks to understand elemental biogeochemical cycles and the evolution of life on Earth. Specifically, it asks questions about where microbes live, their local and global abundance, their structural and functional biochemistry, how they have evolved, biomineralization, and their preservation potential and presence in the rock record. In many ways, GMG appears to be equivalent to geobiology, but differs in scope: geobiology focuses on the role of all life, while GMG is strictly microbial. Regardless, it is these <b>tiniest</b> creatures that dominated to history of life integrated over time and seem to have had the most far-reaching effects.|$|E

Tim Adams concurred in The Observer, calling the observation [...] "wonderfully precise". Mark Lawson in The Guardian said McEwan's style had matured into [...] "scrupulous, sensual rhythms," [...] and noted the considered word choice that enables his work. Perowne, for example, is a convincing neurosurgeon {{by the end}} of the book.

500|$|The writing {{staff was}} {{looking for a way to}} end the episode and {{executive}} producer Sam Simon suggested that they watch the film The Quiet Man. The writers came in on a Saturday to watch the film together. They were inspired by the film's fight scene between John Wayne and Victor McLaglen's characters to do a fight scene between Homer and Tom in the episode. The scene was difficult for the producers to sound-mix because they wanted it to be funny but not horrifying. They discovered that the more realistic the effects used sounded, the funnier the scene became.

[...] The North Carolina Standard hoped {{that they would be}} struck at the Charlotte Mint and circulated locally to eliminate the problem of small-denomination bank notes from out of state.

[...] According to Down Beat, the frantic burbles of congas on [...] "Moja" [...] and [...] "Tatu" [...] predated oldschool jungle by 20 years, while Spin journalist Erik Davis found its anguished, ferocious music extremely impressive, especially when listened to loud. He contended that the group improvisation on tracks such as [...] "Wili" [...] foreshadowed the drum 'n' bass genre: [...] "Miles was invoking the primordial powers of the electronic urban jungle". In The Penguin Guide to Jazz (1998), Richard Cook and Brian Morton wrote that each performance comprises only [...] "shadings and sanations of sound, and as one gets to know these recordings better one becomes almost fixated on the <b>tiniest</b> inflexions."

500|$|Mark Mangini {{served as}} The Voyage Homes sound designer. He {{described}} it as different from working on many other films because Nimoy appreciated the role of sound effects and made sure that they were prominent in the film. Since many sounds familiar to Star Trek had been established—the Bird-of-Prey's cloaking device, the transporter beam, et al.—Mangini focused on making only small changes to them. The most important sounds were those of the whales and the probe. Mangini's brother lived near biologist Roger Payne, who had recordings of whale song. Mangini went through the tapes and chose sounds that could be mixed to suggest conversation and language. The probe's screeching calls were the whale song in distorted form. The humpback's communication with the probe at {{the climax of the}} film contained no dramatic music, meaning that Mangini's sounds had to stand alone. He recalled that he had difficulty with envisioning how the scene would unfold, leading Bennett to perform a puppet show to explain. Nimoy and the other producers were unhappy with Mangini's attempts to create the probe's droning operating noise; after more than a dozen attempts, the sound designer finally asked Nimoy what he thought the probe should sound like. Mangini recorded Nimoy's guttural [...] "wub-wub-wub" [...] response, distorted it with [...] "just the <b>tiniest</b> bit of dressing", and used it as the final sound.|$|E

[...] That same year, Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar named it as number one top [...] "cult-classic franchise" [...] that should be rebooted in a way Prince of Persia was, commenting that [...] "despite a small cast of characters, minimalist gameplay, and some truly grueling difficulty, Another World... resonated with gamers in ways they weren't expecting.
