40|$|This (4 th) {{report on}} the {{toxicity}} of ambient particulate matter (PM) presents effects of the model compounds for PM in ambient air - ammonium bisulfate, ammonium ferrosulfate and ammonium nitrate - on healthy rats and rats with monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension (PH). The objective {{was based on the}} epidemiological indications that people with cardiopulmonary diseases form a part of the general population sensitive to acute exposure to PM, and that ambient mass concentrations of sulfate and nitrate appear associated with health effects. Concretely, the study would test the hypothesis that secondary aerosols exert pulmonary effects in rats, and that rats with PH are more sensitive to these aerosols than normal healthy animals. Healthy and PH rats were exposed to ultrafine and fine ammonium aerosols for four hours a day for three consecutive days. The two independent studies performed with ammonium bisulfate differed only in the mass concentrations of the aerosol <b>test</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> The animals were sacrificed one day after the last exposure to establish effects on the airways using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analysis, airway reactivity measurements and histopathological microscopical examination. The MCT treatment (to induce pulmonary hypertension accompanied by inflammation and ultimately heart failure) was successful, as seen by medial hypertrophy of muscular pulmonary arteries and neomuscularization of small blood vessels. Histopathological examination did not reveal test-atmosphere-related abnormalities. There were no signs of cytotoxicity due to aerosol exposures (measured with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and protein and albumin contents in BALF). Since no changes were observed in N-acetyl glucosaminidase (NAG), macrophages had not been activated due to the MCT treatment or the <b>test</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> Cell differentiation profiles were inconsistent, partly caused by an unavoidable infection with Haemophilus sp. However, despite this, the <b>test</b> <b>atmospheres</b> did not affect cell differentiation or total cell counts. The results suggest that at exposure levels comparable to previous studies in asthmatic mice, ammoniun salt aerosols do not exert marked adverse health effects in either healthy or PH rats...|$|R

40|$|The {{corrosion}} behaviour of NiCrAl alloys in air containing {{small amounts}} of S 0 $_{ 2 }$ has been invetigated. The alloys containing 9 - 20 wt% chromium and 6 - 10 wt% aluminium were oxidized in air and in air containing 1 vol% S 0 $_{ 2 }$. In addition to long term tests, {{the initial stages of}} oxidation were examined using various surface analysis techniques. The results have shown that small SO$_{ 2 }$ additions to the <b>test</b> <b>atmosphere</b> cause a much higher oxidation rate, especially for cast alloys of low chromium and high aluminium contents. The mechanism of the deleterious effect of SO$_{ 2 }$ on the oxidation rate was studied in two ways: - measurement of the gas-metal reaction kinetics using gas chromatographical analysis of the test gas - investigation of trace amounts of sulphur in the alloy. On the basis of the results obtained, it can be shown that the high oxidation rates caused by the presence of S 0 $_{ 2 }$ in the <b>test</b> <b>atmosphere</b> can be significantly reduced by increasing the chromium content of the alloy, by adding yttrium to the alloy, and by ensuring a fine-grained microstructure...|$|E

40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: One of {{the most}} widely used in vitro {{particulate}} matter (PM) exposures methods is the collection of PM on filters, followed by resuspension in a liquid medium, with subsequent addition onto a cell culture. To avoid disruption of equilibria between gases and PM, we have developed a direct in vitro sampling and exposure method (DSEM) capable of PM-only exposures. We hypothesize that the separation of phases and post-treatment of filter-collected PM significantly modifies the toxicity of the PM compared to direct deposition, resulting in a distorted view of the potential PM health effects. Controlled test environments were created in a chamber that combined diesel exhaust with an urban-like mixture. The complex mixture was analyzed using both the DSEM and concurrently collected filter samples.
