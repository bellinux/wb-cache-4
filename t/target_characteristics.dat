50|$|The {{mechanism}} of bullet disintegration {{varies with the}} energy transfer {{at the time of}} impact. With sufficient velocity, bullets may be vaporized upon impact. Few firearms can propel bullets at sufficient velocity to cause reliable vaporization at the target, and air resistance causes bullet velocity to decrease with increasing distance from the firing point; so frangible bullets typically rely upon other mechanisms for disintegration at lower velocities. <b>Target</b> <b>characteristics</b> are an important aspect of interaction with the bullet. Energy available to initiate the disintegration mechanism is limited by {{the rate at which the}} target slows the bullet; so bullets may pass through flexible, fragile or low-density materials without slowing the bullet enough to cause disintegration. Bullets must resist disintegration during handling, loading, and firing to reliably hit the target; so high-velocity loads may require a non-frangible jacket to protect a frangible core from disintegration prior to target impact. The jacket may ricochet, but should have reduced range without the weight of the frangible core. Frangible hollow-point bullets may penetrate clothing, drywall, and light sheet metal; but often disintegrate upon striking glass.|$|E

Most studies which examine the differences in implicit leadership theories either focus on differences in the raters such as gender, religion, culture, and other individual differences, or focus on target differences such as race of the leader, gender of the leader, and position held by the leader.

The algorithm in FLIR 92 for calculating target acquisition probabilities, called ACQUIRE, has several limitations in its design for calculating a <b>target's</b> <b>characteristic</b> dimension. This thesis develops a Dynamic Model to overcome these limitations. It incorporates a three dimensional view of a target based on range, azimuth angle to target, and the altitude of the FLIR sensor.

An Empirical Cumulative Tail Distribution is computed from experimental data, and the theoretical probability vs. range predictions of each model are then compared to actual observations.

At the same time, the issues of participatory planning and its involvement in the planning processes are discussed. The cadastral territory of the villages of Vědomice and Černěves was chosen as the model territory. The practical part concentrates on processing the landscape analysis of the territory. The next step is determining the characteristics of the landscape in cooperation with the public. On the basis of a specified analysis, specific values, problems and conflicts in the territory are set, representing the basis for establishing the alternative scenarios of the landscape development and the subsequent design of the <b>target</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the landscape. The public is actively involved in the process of selecting the alternative scenarios and in the subsequent design of the <b>target</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the landscape, with the respect to their wishes and requirements The result of the processing is the design of the <b>target</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the landscape, which conceptually leads to a balanced, harmonious landscape that is habitable for the local residents with sustainable development of the landscape.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{factors associated with}} social movements ’ abilities to disrupt corporate targets. I identify two kinds of disruption: market disruption and mediated disruption. Market disruption deters {{the ability of the}} corporate target to effectively accrue and use market resources, while mediated disruption occurs as a tactic communicates a movement’s claims about the target through third party intermediaries, like the media, thereby disrupting the target’s image and reputation. Using data on corporate boycotts in the United States from 1990 to 2005, the analyses assess the extent to which movement characteristics or <b>target</b> <b>characteristics</b> cause stock price declines of boycotted companies—i. e., market disruption—and the frequency of national media attention given to boycotts—i. e., mediated disruption. The analyses indicate that <b>target</b> <b>characteristics</b> matter more in shaping a boycott’s initial market disruption; however, both movement and <b>target</b> <b>characteristics</b> affect mediated disruption. Certain movement characteristics, like social movement organization (SMO) formality, public demonstrations, and celebrity endorsements, enable mediated disruption but have no effect on market disruption. A firm’s size makes it vulnerable to both market and mediated disruption, while slack resources help a firm avoid market disruption. A target’s reputational ranking initially buffers it from market disruption but increases its vulnerability to mediated disruption. The results indicate that the two kinds of disruption are interrelated. Market disruption has a marginal effect on the intensity of subsequent media coverage and ongoing media attention accentuates further market disruption...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to test the interactions between personal, situational, and <b>target</b> <b>characteristics</b> in the performance of aggressive behaviors. Aggression was operationalized as a batter being hit by a pitcher’s thrown ball in Major League Baseball games between 1963 and 1992. Consistent with Tedeschi and Felson’s (1994) social interactionist approach to aggression, pitchers were more likely to hit batters in situations that allowed them the opportunity to protect valued social identities. More importantly, three-way interactions revealed that the likelihood of being hit by a pitch in these “high-risk ” situations depended on the background of the pitcher and the race of the batter. Consistent with the culture of honor theory (Nisbett & Cohen, 1996), pitchers born in the southern United States were more likely to hit batters in these high-risk situations, but only if the batter was White. Pitchers not born in the South were more likely to target African-Americans in these situations. The discussion centers around the importance of personal (e. g., culture of honor) and <b>target</b> <b>characteristics</b> (e. g., target race) as they interact with situations to produce aggressive behavior...|$|E
