5|$|Most bus {{services}} {{are provided by}} First West of England or Crosville Motor Services. All services call at stops in the Regent Street and Big Lamp Corner area, including some stops in the adjacent High Street. Some town services and those <b>to</b> <b>Sand</b> Bay, Wells, Burnham-on-Sea and Bristol Airport start from or run via the main railway station. The service <b>to</b> <b>Sand</b> Bay is sometimes operated by an open top bus. National Express and Bakers Dolphin operate long distance coach services, mostly from the coach terminal in Locking Road Car Park which {{is close to the}} railway station.|$|E
5|$|Kauri gum is a fossilised resin detracted from kauri trees (Agathis australis), {{which is}} made into crafts such as jewellery. Kauri forests once covered much of the North Island of New Zealand, before Māori and European {{settlers}} caused deforestation, causing several areas to revert <b>to</b> <b>sand</b> dunes, scrubs, and swamps. Even afterward, ancient kauri fields continued to provide a source for the gum and the remaining forests.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's tombstone, {{featuring}} the muse of music, Euterpe, weeping over a broken lyre, {{was designed and}} sculpted by Clésinger. The expenses of the funeral and monument, amounting to 5,000 francs, were covered by Jane Stirling, who also paid {{for the return of}} the composer's sister Ludwika to Warsaw. Ludwika took Chopin's heart in an urn, preserved in alcohol, back to Poland in 1850. She also took a collection of two hundred letters from Sand to Chopin; after 1851 these were returned <b>to</b> <b>Sand,</b> who seems to have destroyed them.|$|E

5|$|Route 41 {{was chosen}} {{as one of the}} initial routes to be routed through the Metro Bus Tunnel in Downtown Seattle, but due to a delay in the {{production}} of special dual-mode buses for the tunnel, route 41 was not moved into the tunnel until 1991. Route 41 ran primarily during peak hours, with some limited midday service, and was supplemented by route 307, which ran from Downtown Seattle to Northgate and Bothell on weekends and nights. The northern terminus of route 41 was moved from Magnuson Park to 5th Avenue NE and NE 125th Street in 1997, eliminating service <b>to</b> <b>Sand</b> Point and Lake City.|$|E
5|$|The Sable Island {{horses are}} a feral horse {{population}} that is entirely unmanaged: they {{are not subject to}} any kind of interference. Observational research, which is considered noninvasive to the herd, has been conducted by various entities over several decades. The population in recent years (2009 and onward) has varied between 400 and 550 animals. Due to the lack of predators, older horses often die of starvation after their teeth are worn down by a lifetime of exposure <b>to</b> <b>sand</b> and marram, a tough grass. A lack of nutritional food on the island limits the horses' size, and the offspring of those removed from the island and raised on better diets are significantly larger.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} {{characteristics of the}} central murti (image) of Vithoba at Pandharpur, and various textual references to it, have inspired theories relating to Vithoba worship. Sand concludes, from a version of Pundalik's legend in the Skanda Purana (see Legend below), that two distinct murtis must have existed at Pandharpur—one each of tirtha and kshetra type. The earlier one was a tirtha murti, an image purposely sited near a holy body of water (tirtha), in this case facing west, on the Bhima riverbed, near the Pundalik shrine. The later murti, according <b>to</b> <b>Sand,</b> was a kshetra murti, located at a place of holy power (kshetra), in this case facing east, on the hill where the current temple has stood since about 1189. Thus, Sand proposes that the worship of Vithoba may predate the temple itself.|$|E

5|$|Effects from Helene in South Carolina {{were less}} severe than in North Carolina. Helene made its closest {{approach}} to the state on September27, 85mi (135km). In Charleston, sustained winds reached 63mph (101km/h) and there was minor damage reported Trees and street signs were blown down, and beach houses suffered shingle damage. Sporadic and small power outages occurred throughout the city. Damage became progressively worse from Georgetown to Little River, with automobile accidents, torn roofs, and damaged piers. On Harbor Island, 50percent of structure {{were reported to have}} roof damage, causing and estimated $125,000in damages. Elsewhere along the South Carolina coast, beach erosion occurred due to the strong waves, and sections of pier were swept into sea. In Windy Hill and Cherry Grove Beach, three fishing piers were damaged. Damage was minor in Myrtle Beach, and was limited to roof and window damage. Further inland, in Columbia, damage was minimal, with no rainfall reported. Light damage to crops was reported inland, particularly in Marion County. Across the state, damages were estimated at $200,000from the hurricane, though this did not include beach erosion or damage <b>to</b> <b>sand</b> dunes.|$|E

25|$|A non-occupational form of {{silicosis}} {{has been}} described that is caused by long-term exposure <b>to</b> <b>sand</b> dust in desert areas, with cases reported from the Sahara, Libyan desert and the Negev. The disease is caused by deposition of this dust in the lung. Desert lung disease {{may be related to}} Al Eskan disease, a lung disorder thought to be caused by exposure <b>to</b> <b>sand</b> dust containing organic antigens, which was first diagnosed after the 1990 Gulf war. The relative importance of the silica particles themselves and the microorganisms that they carry in these health effects remains unclear.|$|E

25|$|Shell moulding, {{also known}} as shell-mould casting, is an {{expendable}} mold casting process that uses a resin covered sand to form the mold. As compared <b>to</b> <b>sand</b> casting, this process has better dimensional accuracy, a higher productivity rate, and lower labor requirements. It is used for small to medium parts that require high precision.|$|E

PenAir having a monopoly over the town has caused {{them to be able to}} charge people overpriced tickets.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} of Acochlidiacea is poorly known. With a {{typically}} low reproductive output in Acochlidiacea (max. of 40 eggs in Pontohedyle milaschewitchii), free veliger larvae are assumed {{to stay in the}} interstices of the sand grains rather than entering the water column thereby avoiding long distance dispersal. Fertilized eggs are attached <b>to</b> <b>sand</b> grains and might promote dispersal via current driven sediment transport along shorelines.|$|E

5000|$|At {{a period}} in time when George Sand's free-love and {{independent}} lifestyle was quite unusual for a 19th-century woman, Hays and her friend, Elizabeth Ashurst were [...] "broad-minded" [...] and intrigued by {{the political and social}} messages addressed in Sand's books.

25|$|Several small tunnels run under {{roads in}} Boca, but {{the roads are}} built up several feet at these locations, or are on dunes. Several of these tunnels are under State Road A1A at Spanish River Park, from {{the west side of}} the road where parking is {{available}} to beachgoers, to the east side of the road, which is where the beach is located. A1A is already higher than the surrounding land here due <b>to</b> <b>sand</b> dunes formed by erosion and other natural features.|$|E
25|$|The loss of {{freshwater}} flows to the delta over {{the twentieth century}} has reduced delta wetlands to about 5 percent of their original extent, and nonnative species have compromised the ecological health of much of what remains. Stress on ecosystems has allowed invasive plants to out-compete native species along Colorado River riparian areas. Native forests of cottonwood and willow have yielded <b>to</b> <b>sand</b> and mudflats dominated by the nonnative tamarisk (also known as salt cedar), arrowweed, and iodinebush, a transformation that has decreased the habitat value of the riparian forest (Briggs and Cornelius, 1997).|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} material characteristic is the sediment grain size, which must closely match the native material. Excess silt and clay fraction (mud) versus the natural turbidity in the nourishment area disqualifies some materials. Projects with unmatched grain sizes performed relatively poorly. Nourishment sand {{that is only}} slightly smaller than native sand can result in significantly narrower equilibrated dry beach widths compared <b>to</b> <b>sand</b> {{the same size as}} (or larger than) native sand. Evaluating material fit requires a sand survey that usually includes geophysical profiles and surface and core samples.|$|E

50|$|In simple terms, {{the process}} of {{polishing}} concrete is similar <b>to</b> <b>sanding</b> wood.
