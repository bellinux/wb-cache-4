500|$|Referring to the Court's recent {{decision}} in Rapanos v. United States, Thomas noted with some incredulity {{that while the}} Justices in the instant decision [...] "disregard the commander-in-chief's wartime decisions", they had no trouble deferring to {{the judgment of the}} Corps of Engineers in upholding the agency's [...] "wildly implausible conclusion that a storm drain is a tributary of the waters of the United States". He added that [...] "It goes without saying <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> more at stake here than storm drains." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Judith B. Rosenfeld of the Knoxville News-Sentinel, Naylor {{makes the}} {{statement}} that children raised in healthy families make ethical choices and ultimately thrive. In a 1994 interview Naylor said: [...] Naylor believes <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> [...] "gray area between right and wrong". Instead of following the straightforward correct path, Marty is forced to select between two unpalatable choices. Reviewer Matt Berman of The Times-Picayune believed that the book's main moral is that [...] "nothing {{is as simple as}} it seems". Entertainment Weekly Michele Landsberg praised the novel, writing that Shiloh is a [...] "strongly persuasive story of moral growth, told without a hint of moralizing and with acute insight into a preadolescent's inner life".|$|E

500|$|Whatever his motivations, Mason {{proved a}} {{forceful}} advocate {{for a bill}} of rights whose Objections helped accomplish his aims. Rutland noted that [...] "from the opening phrase of his Objections to the Bill of Rights that James Madison offered in Congress two years later, the line is so direct that we can say that Mason forced Madison's hand. Federalist supporters of the Constitution could not overcome the protest caused by Mason's phrase 'There is no declaration of rights'." [...] O'Connor wrote that [...] "Mason lost his battle against ratification... his ideals and political activities have significantly influenced our constitutional jurisprudence."

500|$|The philosopher Michael Ruse {{wrote in}} [...] (1988) that Bell et al.′s {{findings}} about the parental backgrounds of heterosexuals and homosexuals were [...] "slanted {{in the way}} a Freudian would expect", adding that many other studies have pointed to very similar conclusions. Ruse argued <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> to support Bell et al.′s conclusion that Freudian explanations of homosexuality confuse the direction of cause and effect and that the cold and distant relationships gay men report having with their fathers are a result of parental reactions to effeminate or sensitive sons. However, he noted that the accuracy of Bell et al.′s findings is open to doubt for many reasons: their subjects could have been unwittingly giving them the answers they wanted to hear, failed to remember accurately, or suppressed painful childhood memories.|$|E
500|$|The {{anonymous}} reviewer in Popular Science Monthly in December 1892 {{writes that}} Beddard has [...] "made a book interesting {{to both the}} zoologist and the general reader." [...] On protective coloration, [...] "he raises the question whether {{as a matter of}} fact animals are concealed from their foes by their protective resemblances, and shows <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> evidence on the negative side", and further that such colours are sometimes produced [...] "more simply and directly than by the operation of natural selection." [...] On warning colours, the reviewer notes that Beddard gives [...] "much weight" [...] to Eisig's theory that [...] "the usual bright pigments" [...] in caterpillars (accidentally) cause inedibility, [...] "instead of being produced to advertise it" [...] and that Beddard cautions against assuming that [...] "the sight or taste of animals were the same as that of man".|$|E

500|$|Like Angelou's {{previous}} autobiographies, Song received mostly positive reviews, although as the Poetry Foundation has said: [...] "Most {{critics have}} judged Angelou's subsequent autobiographies {{in light of}} her first, and I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings remains the most highly praised." [...] Kim Hubbard of People Magazine, for example, found Song unsatisfying and [...] "hastily assembled", but poetic like Caged Bird. [...] Many reviewers appreciated what Kirkus Reviews called Angelou's [...] "nice structural turn" [...] of framing Song with two assassinations. [...] Paula Friedman of The New York Times Book Review appreciated Angelou's [...] "occasions of critical self-assessment and modesty" [...] not present in many other autobiographies. [...] Patricia Elam of New Crisis agreed, stating <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> to admire both about the book and about the [...] "large life", full of tension, laughter, and love, it describes. [...] Elam also called Song [...] "a spirit-moving work that describes Angelou's journey through an authentic and artistic life".|$|E
500|$|The Blu-ray {{version was}} {{released}} on 2 December 2008. It contains audio in English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, and Thai, and subtitles in 10 languages. Glenn Erickson of DVD Talk also criticized the film, yet praised the Blu-ray release, rating it 4½ [...] stars out of 5 for its video quality and 4 out of 5 for its audio, though only giving it 1½ stars for its extras, noting the lack of special features. A review from Blu-Ray.com also gave a favourable review of both the audio and visual quality, stating [...] "I don't think <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> here one could be dissatisfied with." [...] High-Def Digest, however, gave a more negative review. Whilst praising the audio quality, the lack of special features was criticized, as was the video quality, which was described as being [...] "smothered" [...] with edge enhancement. The reviewer concluded, [...] "Sony is practically begging people not to buy it." ...|$|E
500|$|Ralph M. Rowlett of the University of Missouri wrote {{a review}} of The Bog People for the journal American Anthropologist. He began his review by {{describing}} his background interest in bog bodies, and highlighting that he had married one of Glob's graduate students. He proceeds to note <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> {{in the book that}} would be of interest to anthropologists, and he hoped {{that they would not be}} put off by its use of [...] "gossip and anecdote" [...] and its [...] "intensely personal and culturally ultra-Danish tone", which he attributes to Glob's attempts to reach a wider, non-academic audience. Praising Glob's use of ethnohistory and epic literature to illuminate the Early Iron Age, he claims that The Bog People represents [...] "one of the best modern ethnographic descriptions of the North Germani of that era" [...] and that it furthermore provides evidence in support of Tacitus' claims. Rowlett goes on to praise Bruce-Mitford's translation, but believes that he has a [...] "slight tendency to over-translate" [...] with place names, and also disagrees with his decision to convert centimeters into inches. Ending his review, Rowlett notes that along with Alfred Deick's catalog of bog bodies, The Bog People represented [...] "a starter for a by no means exhausted field." ...|$|E

Campers help with all aspects of the camp, including meal preparation and maintenance, and work together on intellectual or cultural projects of their own choosing. They also conceive of and carry out landcaping projects to improve the camp, such as building a Finnish sauna or a Japanese rock garden. The eight weeks at CRS became a life-transforming experience. [...] Alumni often choose professions of service and stay involved with the camp for decades afterward.|$|E

The 15th-century Perpendicular clerestory windows, eight each at the north and south, contain three cusped lights. The nave roof is slate, as {{is that of the}} 19th-century chancel. The pointed gabled south porch dates from about 1312, and contains a pointed-arch entrance opening. Its church south door within has 14th-century ironwork on its lock. The porch is lit by mullioned side windows, its interior containing a stone bench at each side.|$|E
2500|$|Greene {{has stated}} that he sees science as {{incompatible}} with literalist interpretations of religion. He has argued that: [...] "But if you don't view God as the reservoir of temporary answers to issues we haven't solved scientifically, but rather as some overarching structure within which science takes place, and if that makes you happy and satisfied, so be it. I don't {{see the need for}} that; others do." [...] He has also stated <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> in the New Atheism movement which resonates with him because he personally does not feel the need for religious explanation. However, he is uncertain of its efficacy as a strategy for spreading a scientific worldview.|$|E
2500|$|Judaism has {{traditionally}} taught that God is omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent. Yet, these claims are in jarring {{contrast with the}} fact <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> evil in the world. Perhaps the most difficult question that monotheists have confronted is [...] "how can one reconcile {{the existence of this}} view of God with the existence of evil?" [...] or [...] "how can there be good without bad?" [...] "how can there be a God without a devil?" [...] This is the problem of evil. [...] Within all monotheistic faiths many answers (theodicies) have been proposed. [...] However, in light of the magnitude of evil seen in the Holocaust, many people have re-examined classical views on this subject. How can people still have any kind of faith after the Holocaust? [...] This set of Jewish philosophies is discussed in the article on Holocaust theology.|$|E

2500|$|Some initial {{military}} reactions {{seemed to}} dismiss the news {{as if it were}} of little importance, with one spokesperson comparing the verses to the presence of the phrase [...] "In God we Trust" [...] on United States currency. However General David Petraeus left no doubt that senior commanders, once apprised of the situation, considered the situation to be extremely serious. Delivering what news reports called a [...] "stinging criticism of the contractor," [...] Petraeus said that [...] "It is disturbing. This is a serious concern to me and to the other commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan because it indeed conveys a perception that is absolutely contrary to what we have sought to do."

Entertainment Weeklys Mikael Wood commented that [...] "his ethereal vocals still shimmer so effortlessly", and called it [...] "the year's most elegant tell-all". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] "DeBarge simply soars, his feather-light vocals still in top form". Steve Jones of USA Today felt that DeBarge's [...] "sweet, soaring falsetto remains intact, and he has lost none of his knack for writing catchy, romantic tunes".
