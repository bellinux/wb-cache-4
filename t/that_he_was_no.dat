Now <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer under Kinkaid's command, Christie renewed his push to get Dealey awarded the Medal of Honor, this time by getting the endorsement for the decoration from MacArthur. The general agreed, and Dealey was posthumously awarded the medal.|$|E
5|$|The {{statement}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> strategist {{can find}} merit {{as it was}} observed that he showed little inclination to contemplate those stretches of the front he did not command and therefore disregarding the strategic field to conduct warfare. But the conditions, by then, did not exist for any general in the Third Reich.|$|E
5|$|Blomkamp {{declared}} the project dead in late 2007, but Jackson replied {{that the film}} would still be made. Blomkamp and Jackson collaborated on District 9, but the director told /Film <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer considering working on a Halo film if the opportunity arose, saying that after working on the film for five months before the project's collapse {{it would be difficult}} to return.

5|$|Henry II died in 1189 and was {{succeeded by}} Richard I. Rhys {{considered}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer {{bound by the}} agreement with King Henry and attacked the Norman lordships surrounding his territory. He ravaged Pembroke, Haverfordwest, and Gower and captured the castles of St. Clear's, Laugharne, and Llansteffan. Richard's brother, Prince John (later King John), came to Wales in September {{and tried to make}} peace. He persuaded Rhys to raise the siege of Carmarthen and accompany him to Oxford to meet Richard. Rhys arrived at Oxford to discover that Richard was not prepared to travel there to meet him, and hostilities continued.|$|E
5|$|In August 1930, St Hill {{signed a}} {{contract}} to play professional cricket in the Lancashire League in England, which meant <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer eligible to play cricket for Shannon or Trinidad. At the time, competition rules barred professional cricketers from taking part. Consequently, the first-class matches he played in Australia were {{the last of his}} career. In his eight seasons in the Bonanza Cup, St Hill took 224 wickets at an average of 9.42, and topped the bowling averages for the competition in 1924 and 1929.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, {{after months}} of public tensions, Bonamassa {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer a member of Black Country Communion, with the question over whether the group would continue with another guitarist unclear. Days later, Hughes confirmed that the band was officially over, hinting that he would continue working with Bonham and Sherinian under a new collective name. Sherinian later joined Bonamassa's touring band, while Hughes and Bonham formed California Breed with guitarist Andrew Watt. Hughes and Bonamassa later reconciled and the band reunited in 2016, with fourth album BCCIV released in September 2017.|$|E

5|$|Motley's knees {{continued}} to bother him in 1952. While he showed occasional signs {{of his old}} form that season, {{it became clear to}} the Browns' coaching staff <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer in his prime. Motley finished the year with 444 yards of rushing and 4.3 yards per carry, a career low. The Browns finished with an 8–4 record but still captured the conference title and secured another spot in the NFL championship game. Motley performed well in that matchup against the Detroit Lions, rushing for 95 yards. The Browns, however, lost 17–7.|$|E
5|$|Quiriguá {{traditionally}} {{had been}} subordinate to its southern neighbour, Copán, and in 724 Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, king of Copán, installed K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat upon Quiriguá's throne as his vassal. As early as 734, however, K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat had shown <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer an obedient subordinate of Copán {{when he started}} to refer to himself as k'ul ahaw, holy lord, instead of using the lesser term ahaw, subordinate lord; {{at the same time he}} began to use his own Quiriguá emblem glyph. These early assertions of independence can only have been made if Quiriguá had managed to form an external alliance.|$|E
5|$|That same night, the criollos {{gathered}} {{at the home of}} Rodriguez Pena and compiled a list of members for a governing Junta that was presented on 25 May. Meanwhile, Domingo French, Antonio Beruti, Aparicio, Donado, and other armed men occupied the Plaza and its access points. The list included a balance of representatives from different extractions of local politics. Lezica finally reported to Cisneros <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer in command, and the Primera Junta assumed power.|$|E

5|$|All {{the members}} of the cast for the {{production}} were from Britain or the Commonwealth. Later in the season, one of England's few pre-war international opera stars, Eva Turner, appeared as Turandot. For the company's second season, eminent singers from continental Europe were recruited, including Ljuba Welitsch, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Paolo Silveri, Rudolf Schock and Set Svanholm. Other international stars who were willing to re-learn their roles in English for the company in its early years included Kirsten Flagstad and Hans Hotter for The Valkyrie. Nevertheless, even as early as 1948, the opera in English policy was weakening; the company was obliged to present some Wagner performances in German to recruit leading exponents of the main roles. At first Rankl conducted all the productions; he was dismayed when eminent guest conductors including Beecham, Clemens Krauss and Erich Kleiber were later invited for prestige productions. By 1951 Rankl felt <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer valued, and announced his resignation. In Haltrecht's view, the company that Rankl built up from nothing had outgrown him.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose's bowling method {{relied on}} {{accuracy}} and conceding few runs; {{several of his}} best performances came when he took wickets in quick succession to devastate the opposition. He was particularly successful against leading batsmen. From 1995, Ambrose was increasingly affected by injury, and several times critics claimed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer effective. However, he continued to take wickets regularly up until his retirement, although he was sometimes less effective in the early matches of a series. In his final years, the West Indies team was in decline and often relied heavily on Ambrose and Walsh; both men often bowled with little support from the other bowlers. Following his retirement, Ambrose has pursued a career in music as the bass guitarist in a reggae band.|$|E
5|$|Coenwulf's early reign {{was marked}} by a {{breakdown}} in Mercian control in southern England. In East Anglia, King Eadwald minted coins at about this time, implying <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer subject to Mercia. A charter of 799 seems to show that Wessex and Mercia were estranged for some time before that date, though the charter is not regarded as undoubtedly genuine. In Kent, an uprising began, probably starting after Ecgfrith's death, though {{it has been suggested}} that it began much earlier in the year, before Offa's death. The uprising was led by Eadberht Præn, who had been an exile at Charlemagne's court: Eadberht's cause almost certainly had Carolingian support. Eadberht became king of Kent, and Æthelheard, the archbishop of Canterbury at that time, fled his see; it is likely that Christ Church, Canterbury was sacked.|$|E

5|$|From 1963 to 1965, MRD was not {{directly}} involved in Formula One, and often ran works cars in other formulae. A separate company, Jack Brabham's Brabham Racing Organisation, ran the Formula One works entry. Like other customers, BRO bought its cars from MRD, initially at £3,000 per car, although it did not pay for development parts. Tauranac was unhappy with his distance from the Formula One operation and before the 1966 season suggested <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer interested in producing cars for Formula One under this arrangement. Brabham investigated other chassis suppliers for BRO, however the two reached an agreement and from 1966 MRD was much more closely involved in this category. After Jack Brabham sold his shares in MRD to Ron Tauranac {{at the end of}} 1969, the works Formula One team was MRD.|$|E
5|$|Haig's {{solution}} to this diplomatic crisis was a compromise. Alderson {{was transferred to the}} nominal post of Inspector-General of Canadian Forces and the highly effective Sir Julian Byng replaced him in command of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, supported by Sir Arthur Currie, who had succeeded Alderson in command of the 1st Canadian Division. In exchange, Haig finally got rid of the Ross rifle, all Canadian troops being reissued Lee–Enfields in preparation for the upcoming Battle of the Somme. Alderson was not made aware of the purely nominal nature of his position until later, when he requested a staff car and was informed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer entitled to one. In September 1916, Alderson became Inspector of Infantry in the British Army, a position he retained until 1920, when he retired from active service at the age of 61.|$|E
5|$|In February 1866, having briefly {{served at}} Iași's Pantelimon Church, he was welcomed by hegumen Isaia Vicol Dioclias {{into the service}} of Golia Monastery. Around 1867, his wife Ileana left him. After that moment, Creangă began losing {{interest}} in performing his duties in the clergy, and, while {{doing his best to}} hide <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer living with his wife, took a mistress. The marriage's breakup was later attributed by Creangă himself to Ileana's adulterous affair with a Golia monk, and rumors spread that Ileana's lover was a high-ranking official, the protopope of Iași. Creangă's accusations, Călinescu contends, are nevertheless dubious, because the deacon persisted in working for the same monastery after the alleged incident.|$|E

5|$|Seventeen {{days after}} his release from jail in June 1966, Lamb took a shotgun from his uncle's house and went on a {{shooting}} spree around his East Windsor neighbourhood, killing two strangers and wounding two others. He was charged with capital murder, which under the era's Criminal Code called for a mandatory death penalty, but he avoided this fate when the court found, in January 1967, {{that he had not}} been sane {{at the time of the}} incident. He was committed for an indefinite time in a psychiatric unit. Over the course of six years in care at Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre's Oak Ridge facility he displayed a profound recovery, prompting an independent five-man committee to recommend to the Executive Council of Ontario that he be released, saying <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer a danger to society. The Council approved Lamb's release in early 1973 on the condition that he spend a year living and working under the supervision of one of Oak Ridge's top psychiatrists, Elliot Barker.|$|E
5|$|The miraculous {{story of}} the first known parishioner of the town, Bricstan, is {{documented}} in the Historia Ecclesiastica by the Chronicler Orderic Vitalis (1075 – c.1142). According to the legend, Bricstan was a pious free tenant from the town who had joined the monastery at Ely Cathedral in 1115 to begin training as a monk. However, {{he was accused of}} theft and imprisoned in London. The legend recounts that one night he had a vision of Saint Etheldreda coming towards him, and as if by a miracle, his heavy chains fell from him and he was shackled no longer. When he awoke from his dream, he discovered that this was indeed true and he was free of his chains. The wife of Henry I, Matilda of Scotland, heard of the miracle, and she assured herself <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> rogue or thief, issued a writ of pardon and declared him a free man.|$|E
5|$|When Peng's grand-uncle died in 1911, Peng {{left home}} {{and worked at}} a coalmine in Xiangtan, where he pushed carts of coal for {{thirteen}} {{hours a day for}} a wage of nine yuan a month. In 1912, shortly after the founding of the Republic of China, the mine went bankrupt and the owners fled, cheating Peng out of half his annual wages. Peng returned home in 1912 and took a number of odd jobs. In 1913 Hunan suffered another drought, and Peng participated in a public demonstration that escalated into the seizure of a grain merchant's storehouse, and the redistribution of grain among the peasants. Village police issued a warrant for Peng's arrest, and he fled to northern Hunan, where he worked for two years as a construction laborer {{for the construction of a}} dam near Dongting Lake. When the dam was completed, in 1916, Peng assumed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer in danger of being arrested and returned home, joining the army of a local Kuomintang-aligned warlord, Tang Xiangming.|$|E
