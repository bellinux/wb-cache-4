5|$|In November, Meyszner's area of {{responsibility}} was expanded to include the German occupied territory of Montenegro. The following month, SS-Standartenführer Paul Blobel's Kommando 1005 arrived in Belgrade <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>up</b> and burn {{the bodies of the}} Jewish women and children killed by Meyszner's Gestapo. At the end of 1943, Meyszner was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class.|$|E

5|$|Lee (Rosemarie DeWitt), a yoga instructor, {{brings her}} husband Tim (Jake Johnson), a gym teacher, and their 3-year-old son Jude (Jude Swanberg) to house-sit in a client's {{house for a}} few weeks while the client is away. While walking around the property, Tim finds a gun and a bone in the backyard. At first he wants <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>up</b> the {{surrounding}} ground to see if a body is buried there, but Lee convinces him it is a bad idea.|$|E
5|$|Richmond {{grew up in}} Ashland, Ohio. His parents, Al and Evelyn (née Warner) Richmond, met in {{the course}} of their work. Al was a welder for pipe {{construction}} companies and Evelyn was a field office manager. Noticing that highway crews had <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>up</b> the entire highway to lay pipe, Al designed a machine to bore underneath the highway. To market this invention, he founded Richmond Manufacturing, which eventually exported machines worldwide.|$|E
5|$|According to Di Carlo, {{the remains}} of De Mauro were buried under a bridge over the Oreto river near Palermo. However, the police, after a search, did not find the body. The pentito Francesco Marino Mannoia later {{explained}} why. He had been ordered by Bontade in 1977 or 1978 <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>up</b> several bodies at the bridge and dissolve them in acid. According to the new testimony of the pentito Naimo, De Mauro {{was taken to a}} terrain in Pallavicino neighbourhood in Palermo where the Mafia boss Francesco Madonia owned a chicken farm. He was killed there and dumped in a pit.|$|E

5000|$|Over the 20th century, the archeological {{value of}} the sites was largely {{destroyed}} due <b>to</b> locals <b>digging</b> <b>up</b> the buried ivory and the landmark designation was withdrawn in 1989. [...] The sites remain listed on the National Register.|$|R
5|$|When the IRT subway {{debuted in}} 1904, the typical tunnel {{construction}} method was cut-and-cover. The street was torn <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> the tunnel below before being rebuilt from above. Traffic {{on the street}} above would be interrupted due <b>to</b> the <b>digging</b> <b>up</b> of the street. Temporary steel and wooden bridges carried surface traffic above the construction.|$|R

After a few drinks, they decide <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>up</b> the backyard together, quickly finding another bone and a license plate. Phil, who is skeptical about the digging, leaves with Adam and Paul as Alicia (Anna Kendrick), Max (Brie Larson) and Billy (Chris Messina) arrive at the house. Billy pairs off with Alicia and Ray with Max while Tim continues to dig. He finds a shoe before deciding to go to sleep.|$|E
5|$|Powers {{helped the}} police perform a sting operation, telling Seymour {{that the police}} knew what had {{happened}} and {{that the only way to}} save Williams was <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>up</b> the gun and move it to somewhere more safe. When Seymour and Powers went to do this, several policemen (who had been lying in wait) immediately arrested her and Powers (who was released a few hours later). Seymour was in a poor condition both physically and mentally, and after a few hours she wrote and signed a statement which incriminated Williams. Powers again helped the police, convincing Williams to meet him at Moorgate station, where Williams was arrested by the police and charged with the murder of Arthur Walls. Williams maintained that he was innocent of the murder and burglary.|$|E
5|$|The arid {{conditions}} of the spiny forest, which receives less than 600 millimeters of rainfall each year, largely shape Mikea economic activities. Nearly everything they consume is scavenged from the forest, and the average Mikea needs two hours or less to collect adequate food for the day. Their main source of food is tubers, particularly {{during the dry season}} when few other foods may be reliably available. Adults and children of both genders work <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>up</b> using a metal-tipped digging stick (antsoro) and a digging bowl (kipao). The starchy ovy tuber is roasted or boiled before eating, while the Mikea eat the watery babo (or baboho) raw for hydration or use its water for boiling other foods; the tavolo tuber is dried and ground to make a flour that is sold at village markets. They also gather forest fruits, melons and honey, with the latter a particularly important source of income for the Mikea during the rainy season. To obtain water during the rainy season the Mikea capture rain run-off from the rooftops of their houses using hollowed-out logs or transport water on foot or zebu-drawn wagon from the villages, while during the cool dry season the Mikea consume their store of water-engorged babo tubers and drink water from natural or man-made wells when possible.|$|E

5000|$|In Pitera's trial, {{the chief}} prosecutor, David W. Shapiro, demanded the death {{sentence}} for the [...] "heinous, cruel and depraved" [...] murders committed by Pitera. He called Pitera a [...] "heartless and ruthless killer" [...] explaining in detail how Pitera tortured one victim by slowly, deliberately shooting him seven times {{in various parts of}} the body, in one of a series of murders carried out in a deliberately barbaric manner. The prosecution also produced a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent who testified <b>to</b> <b>digging</b> <b>up</b> graves containing the dismembered bodies of some of Pitera's victims.|$|R

5|$|While some {{cockatoos}} are generalists {{taking a}} wide range of foods, others are specialists. The glossy black cockatoo specialises in the cones of trees of the genus Allocasuarina, preferring a single species, A. verticillata. It holds the cones in its foot and shreds them with its powerful bill before removing the seeds with its tongue. Some species take large numbers of insects, particularly when breeding; in fact the bulk of the yellow-tailed black cockatoo's diet is made up of insects. The large bill is used in order to extract grubs and larvae from rotting wood. The amount of time cockatoos have to spend foraging varies with the season. During times of plenty they may need to feed for only a few hours in the day, in the morning and evening, then {{spend the rest of the}} day roosting or preening in trees, but during the winter most of the day may be spent foraging. The birds have increased nutritional requirements during the breeding season, so they spend more time foraging for food during this time. Cockatoos have large crops, which allow them to store and digest food for some time after retiring to a tree. During hard times, the cockatoos also display versatility in their diet, travelling widely in order to find food, feeding on more green plant material and in some species using their large bills <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>up</b> corms.|$|E
25|$|Hognose snakes' most {{distinguishing}} characteristic {{is their}} upturned snout, which aids in digging in sandy soils {{by using a}} sweeping, side to side motion. They also like to burrow in masses of humus. Lieoheterodon species are known <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>up</b> the eggs of lizards.|$|E
25|$|We can {{conclude}} that these mound builders were organized. Hundreds or even thousands of workers had <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>up</b> tons of earth with the hand tools available, the dirt had to be moved long distances, and finally workers had to create the shape the builder had planned.|$|E

50|$|Like {{most common}} law this {{provision}} {{does not apply}} if some other legal provision over-rides it, for example the species in question is specially protected, say by listing in Schedule 8 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The same act also prohibits uprooting of any wild plant without the landowner's permission, so the Four Fs only applies to picking, for example daisies in a public park; not <b>to</b> <b>digging</b> <b>up,</b> for example, bluebell bulbs or young trees. Another significant exception is that land made accessible through the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 {{is not subject to}} these rights.|$|R
5000|$|The land {{adjacent}} to the church became the largest cemetery in Manchester, used for the interment {{of those who had}} no family place of burial or were too poor to afford a proper funeral. The population density of Angel Meadow in the mid-19th century was in excess of 350 per acre, and as social and living conditions worsened some resorted <b>to</b> <b>digging</b> <b>up</b> the cemetery and selling its soil as fertilizer to nearby farmers. The situation became so bad that an Act of Parliament was passed in 1855 to cover up graveyards with flagstones, hence the name, St Michael's Flags.|$|R
25|$|He also testified {{about the}} murder of {{journalist}} Mauro De Mauro. The investigative reporter had been kidnapped and killed by the Mafia in 1970.

25|$|During {{the period}} of time that the {{salamander}} letter was believed to be authentic, the information contained within it was used in a number of publications and films related to Mormonism. One such film, The God Makers II, suggests that Joseph Smith was required <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>up</b> Alvin’s body and bring a part of it with him to the hill Cumorah in order to obtain the gold plates. The only known source of such a requirement is the salamander letter, which is now known to be a forgery.|$|E

Fearing scandal, {{the decision was made}} to disinter the corpse. The body was sent to the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Maryland, which preserved Guiteau's brain as well as his enlarged spleen discovered at autopsy and bleached the skeleton. These were placed in storage by the museum. Parts of Guiteau's brain remain on display in a jar at the Mütter Museum in Philadelphia.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, {{the mayor}} of Conteville in Normandy, André Dubreuil, noted that during land {{rehabilitation}} of the old quarry of Pierre de Caen, dinosaur bones had surfaced. He secured a partial skull and some ribs and notified the Paris Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle. However, professional excavations only started in 1998 when the rock of the collapsed quarry face had already been spread by a bulldozer over a considerable surface. It proved necessary <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>up</b> and sieve many cubic metres of rubble over several years, ultimately salvaging about two thousand bone fragments, varying in size between one and ten centimetres. From these scraps a more complete skeleton had to be reassembled.|$|E
25|$|The pace of killings slowed in 1942, as ghettoised Jewish slave {{workers were}} {{appropriated}} by the Wehrmacht. As Soviet troops advanced in 1943, the Nazi units {{tried to cover}} up the crime under the Aktion 1005 directive. Eighty inmates from the nearby Stutthof concentration camp were formed into Leichenkommando ("corpse units"). The workers were forced <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>up</b> bodies, pile them on wood and burn them. The ashes were then ground up, mixed with sand and buried. After months of this gruesome work, the brigade managed to escape through a tunnel dug with spoons on 19 April 1944. Eleven of the 80 who escaped survived the war; their testimony contributed to revealing the massacre.|$|E
