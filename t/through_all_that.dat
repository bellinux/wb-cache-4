First was the death of two of his brothers, one younger and the other elder. His elder brother had by then risen {{to the position of}} a sheristadar, a remarkable achievement in those days. The death of his elder brother brought on the entire responsibility of the family on to his shoulders. Second, two of his wives had died and he married a third time. Third, the death of David Hare in 1842. It was a tremendous shock for Ramtanu Lahiri. He revered him as his own father. Throughout his life, he never failed to gather his friends and pay respect to him at his grave on his death anniversary every year.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{seeing the}} {{beginning}} of Charlie's storyline with Darryl Braxton, Stephen said, [...] "Oh, please not another Angelo – I can't go <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> again." [...] When Charlie arrests Darryl for kissing her, Stephen quipped: [...] "That woman {{will do anything to}} get a guy in handcuffs." [...] All About Soap said Charlie and Darryl's chemistry was [...] "clear for everyone to see" [...] and wondered when she would stop hiding behind her [...] "law-abiding facade". When Charlie and Darryl share their [...] "steamy moment", Erin Miller of TV Week said [...] "It was the moment we've all been waiting for." [...] In 2012, Stephen questioned whether there was another police officer who has had [...] "such a difficult life as Charlie". She said she transformed from [...] "lesbian to gangster's moll" [...] and opined that her life continued to [...] "spiral out of control".|$|E
500|$|As Salander's legal guardian, he {{uses his}} {{position}} to sexually abuse and eventually rape her. Salander turns the tables on him, torturing him and branding him as a rapist. Fincher wanted the character to be worse than a typical antagonist, {{although he did not}} want to emulate the stereotypical [...] "mustache-twirling pervert". The director considered Van Wageningen to be the embodiment of a versatile actor—one who was a [...] "full-fledged human being" [...] and a [...] "brilliant" [...] actor. [...] "He was able to bring his performance from a logical place in Bjurman's mind and find the seething morass of darkness inside," [...] Fincher stated. Bjurman's multifaceted psyche was the main reason Van Wageningen wanted to play the role. The Dutch actor said, [...] "This character goes through a lot and I wasn't quite sure I wanted to go <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>that.</b> I started out half way between the elation of getting to work with David Fincher and the dread of this character, but I was able to use both of those things. We both thought the most interesting route would be for Bjurman to seem half affable. The challenge was not in finding the freak violence in the guy but finding the humanity of him." ...|$|E

500|$|Barry Walters from Rolling Stone {{mentioned}} that I'm Going to Tell You a Secret [...] "lacks the dishy delights of the diva's 1991 Truth or Dare doc. Instead, a more worldly Madge struggles {{to become a}} less sound-bite-reliant, more sincere person." [...] Darryl Sterdan from Jam! gave it three out of five stars, saying that [...] "it still sucks to sit <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> video and see almost as much of her limo as her show... For a start, how about giving us a [...] that isn't derivative and self-indulgent?" [...] Colin Jacobson from the DVD Movie Guide website opined that I'm Going to Tell You a Secret would find a divided audience and how one reacted to the documentary was a reflection of how one viewed Madonna. [...] "Fans like me {{will be able to}} essentially ignore the self-serving moments and enjoy the tour elements. We'll also like the glimpse behind the curtain at Madonna on the road," [...] he added. This view was shared by a reviewer from Lexington Herald-Leader who confessed that he did not enjoy the documentary except the live performances, since he saw Madonna only as an [...] "entertainer" [...] and not as a [...] "preacher".|$|E

The British reviewer David Runciman commented in a book review, [...] "for a clear-eyed, sharply observed, mordant but ultimately hopeful account of contemporary politics this memoir is hard to beat. After his defeat, a friend tries to comfort him by telling him that at least he'll get a book out of it. Ignatieff reacts with understandable fury. He didn't go into politics and <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> followed just to write a book. Still, it's some book." ...|$|E

2500|$|The song is one out {{of three}} Elliott-produced records on After the Storm, {{commissioned}} by J Records head and executive producer Clive Davis after the release of Elliott's acclaimed studio album Under Construction (2002) and the delay of Monica's original third studio album All Eyez on Me the year before. It was conceived during a studio session week in Miami in early 2003, and was produced as a sequel to [...] "So Gone," [...] another Elliott track. In an interview with MTV News at the 2003 BET Awards, Monica stated that [...] "'Knock Knock' is [...] like a follow-up to 'So Gone,' just saying that, 'All right, we went <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> stuff, now it's time for you to get lost. This {{is the end of the}} road for you.' So, it's kind of like a 'get back' record." [...] Commenting on the recording process, she added: [...] "She [...] doesn't have any fear [...] When she goes in the studio, her goal is to be creative and to give something new and she could care less what else is current. And she creates new trends by doing that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first three}} {{waves of the}} 139th Brigade got into the German front line, despite many {{casualties}} and parties moved forward to the second trench, some troops straying {{to the left and}} being reported in The Z and Little Z by RFC observation crews, which stopped the British artillery from firing on 'The Z to suppress the German machine-guns. The following waves were also met by massed fire, the fourth wave never got forward as a formation and hardly any of the fifth and sixth waves got beyond the advanced trench. Contact with those who were forward was lost, despite the multiplicity of means used. Telephones, flags, lamps, discs, shutters, pigeons, flares and rockets all failed due to casualties and no runner got <b>through.</b> <b>All</b> <b>that</b> was seen were two flares at [...] by an observation crew. The Sherwood Foresters who were in the German front position were caught from behind by Germans coming up from their shelters, which should have been patrolled by the rear waves trapped in no man's land. The Germans prevented more troops from crossing into the German front position and were seen bombing the British troops who had taken cover in shell-holes near the German wire.|$|E
