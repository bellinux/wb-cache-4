5|$|By 1992, {{black metal}} scenes {{had begun to}} emerge in areas outside Scandinavia, {{including}} Germany, France, and Poland. The 1993 murder of Mayhem's Euronymous by Burzum's Varg Vikernes provoked intensive media coverage. Around 1996, when many in the scene felt the genre was stagnating, several key bands, including Burzum and Finland's Beherit, moved toward an ambient style, while symphonic black metal was explored by Sweden's Tiamat and Switzerland's Samael. In the late 1990s and early 2000s decade, Norway's Dimmu Borgir brought black metal closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream,</b> as did Cradle of Filth.|$|E
5|$|Many Japanese-Palauans assumed key {{positions}} in the public service sector and politics. At least one ethnologist, Mark Peattie, suggested that the strong representation of Japanese-Palauans in leading positions in society could be attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> Japanese education which they had received in their youth. Palau's first president, Kuniwo Nakamura—who was half-Japanese—fostered closer diplomatic ties between Japan and Palau during his Presidency. During a state visit to Japan in 1996, Emperor Akihito personally received Nakamura, and the visit was commended by Palauans and Japanese alike. Nakamura's visit prompted Japan to channel monetary aid to Palau to facilitate repair work on the Koror-Babeldaob Bridge and securing special trade agreements with Japan.|$|E

5|$|Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music {{became one}} of the best-selling albums {{recorded}} by a black musician of the time, as well as one of the best-selling country albums, shipping at least 500,000 copies in its first three months of release. This achievement was due in part <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> promotional efforts Modern Sounds had received from ABC prior to and following release. The album proved to be a crossover hit as well, as distributors claimed the record had been selling in pop, R and country music markets; at the time, often referred to as white and black markets during the period.|$|E
5|$|Alternative rock is {{a diverse}} {{grouping}} of rock bands that in America developed {{largely from the}} hardcore scene in the 1980s in stark opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> music scene. Alternative rock subgenres that developed during the decade include indie rock, Gothic rock, noise rock, grunge, and college rock. Most alternative bands were unified by their collective debt to punk, which {{laid the groundwork for}} underground and alternative music in the 1970s. Though the genre is considered to be rock, some styles were influenced by American folk, reggae and jazz. Like punk and hardcore, alternative rock had little mainstream success in America in the 1980s, but via the grassroots establishment of an indie scene through touring, college radio, fanzines, and word-of-mouth, alternative bands laid the groundwork for the breakthrough of the genre in the American public consciousness in the next decade.|$|E
5|$|Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre in San Jose, California, was {{the first}} {{location}} to open on May 17, 1977. The concept was authored by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, credited with bringing video games such as Pong <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream.</b> The Pizza Time Theatre {{was the first}} family restaurant to integrate food, animated entertainment, and an indoor arcade. Following a filing for bankruptcy, the chain was acquired by competitor Showbiz Pizza Place in 1984, forming Showbiz Pizza Time, Inc. In 1990, the company began unifying the two brands {{with the goal of}} renaming every location to Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza. They redesigned the logo in 1994, dropping Pizza from each store's name. In 1998, Showbiz Pizza Time, Inc. became CEC Entertainment, Inc. As of 2017, 523 Chuck E. Cheese stores are open.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi's arrest lasted two years, as he {{was held}} in the Aga Khan Palace in Pune. During this period, his long time {{secretary}} Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack, his wife Kasturba died after 18 months' imprisonment on 22 February 1944; and Gandhi suffered a severe malaria attack. While in Jail, he agreed to an interview with Stuart Gelder, a British journalist. Gelder then composed and released an interview summary, cabled it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> press, that announced sudden concessions Gandhi was willing to make, comments that shocked his countrymen, the Congress workers and even Gandhi. The latter two claimed that it distorted what Gandhi actually said on a range of topics and falsely repudiated the Quit India movement.|$|E
5|$|Magnapop {{established}} their fan {{base in the}} early 1990s through touring and the festival circuit—particularly in central Europe, where they first broke through <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream.</b> It was only after they had established a fan base in Europe and received positive press in the United Kingdom that the band first became recognized in the United States, including their native Atlanta. By the end of 1992, they were getting positive write-ups in American press such as The New York Times and supported Juliana Hatfield on tour. The group made appearances at Rocking Kolonia Festival in Maastricht in 1992, Pukkelpop in 1992, Transmusicales in 1992, A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise in 1993, and the Reading Festival in 1993. They also recorded a John Peel session on September 2, 1993 and a Black Session on February 25, 1994.|$|E
5|$|Many Turkish {{cities and}} towns have vibrant local music scenes which, in turn, support a number of {{regional}} musical styles. Despite this however, western-style music styles like pop music and kanto lost popularity to arabesque in the late 70s and 80s. It became popular again {{by the beginning of}} the 1990s, as a result of an opening economy and society. With the support of Sezen Aksu, the resurging popularity of pop music gave rise to several international Turkish pop stars such as Tarkan and Sertab Erener. The late 1990s also saw an emergence of underground music producing alternative Turkish rock, electronica, hip-hop, rap and dance music in opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> corporate pop and arabesque genres, which many believe have become too commercial.|$|E

5|$|The {{dominance}} of gangsta rap in mainstream hip-hop was supplanted in the late-2000s, largely due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> success of hip-hop {{artists such as}} Kanye West. The outcome of a highly publicized sales competition between the simultaneous release of his and gangsta rapper 50 Cent's third studio albums, Graduation and Curtis respectively, has since been accredited to the decline. The competition resulted in record-breaking sales performances by both albums and West outsold 50 Cent, selling nearly a million copies of Graduation {{in the first week}} alone. Industry observers remark that West's victory over 50 Cent proved that rap music did not have to conform to gangsta-rap conventions in order to be commercially successful. West effectively paved the way for a new wave of hip-hop artists, including Drake, Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole, who did not follow the hardcore-gangster mold and became platinum-selling artists.|$|E
5|$|The {{sections}} of the International that recognised {{the leadership of the}} International Secretariat remained optimistic about the possibilities for increasing the International's political influence and extended the entrism into social democratic parties which was already underway in Britain, Austria and elsewhere. The 1954 congress emphasised entrism into communist parties and nationalist parties in the colonies, pressing for democratic reforms, ostensibly to encourage the left-wing they perceived to exist in the communist parties to join with them in a revolution. Tensions developed between those who subscribed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> views of Pablo and a minority that argued unsuccessfully against open work. A number of these delegates walked out of the World Congress, and would eventually leave the International, including the leader of the new British section, John Lawrence, George Clarke, Michele Mestre (a leader of the French section), and Murray Dowson (a leader of the Canadian group).|$|E
