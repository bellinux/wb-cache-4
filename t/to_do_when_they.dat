5|$|In 1911, sensing {{they were}} close to {{achieving}} suffrage, Rathbone & Stewart-Bright created Municipal Women's Association as {{a branch of the}} society; its aim was to increase awareness of the vote for women, encourage discussion amongst potential women voters and teaching women what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> had the vote. In 1912, the Liverpool Women Suffrage Society disagreed with the route that the National Union Women's Suffrage Societies was taking, with its Election Fighting Fund, and instead merged with the Municipal Women's Association to become the Liverpool Women's Citizen's Association. The outbreak of World War I changed the focus of groups to help with the national emergency and in 1919 the groups merged. By 1921 they had 12 branches.|$|E

Ebner stated that [...] "Hacking their site is not really the best way to go about taking them (the Church of Scientology) down. Most critics you talk to want the Scientology site to be up there so that people who are interested can see the stupidity they have on the web and at the same time they can go - they are a few keystrokes from getting a thousand other opinions." [...] Nick Douglas explained that the group decided to shift their strategy away from the attacks to Scientology websites: [...] "Anonymous even decided that they were going to stop that attack, that it was a bad idea. It's the usual thing they used <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> really hadn't had a thought out plan, and here they're realizing they actually have to figure out some real plan against a real enemy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Finally the Coca-Cola board {{changed their}} minds and decided {{to bring back the}} old Coke. Company {{president}} Donald Keough revealed years later, in the documentary The People vs. Coke (2002), that they realized this was the only right thing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> visited a small restaurant in Monaco and the owner of the restaurant proudly said they had [...] "the real thing, it's a real Coke," [...] offering them a chilled 6 and 1/2 oz. glass bottle of original Coca-Cola.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2005–06 season, the Colonials were {{reminded}} how [...] much work the program needed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were stunned by the Penn State University club team in a 3–2 exhibition loss prior to the season. [...] Two games later, however, RMU shocked CCHA member Western Michigan in a 5–2 victory that Schooley called [...] "the biggest win for our program." [...] The Colonials improved to 12–20–3 in their second season while advancing to the CHA semifinals for the first time.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Schneider was {{disappointed}} with Malick. He had confronted Malick numerous times about missed deadlines and broken promises. Due to further cost overruns, {{he had to}} ask Paramount for more money, which he preferred not <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>When</b> <b>they</b> screened a demo for Paramount and made their pitch, the studio was impressed and reportedly [...] "gave Malick a very sweet deal at the studio, carte blanche, essentially". Malick {{was not able to}} capitalize on the deal. He was so exhausted from working on the film that he moved to Paris with his girlfriend. He tried developing another project for Paramount, but after a substantial amount of work, he abandoned it. He did not make another film until 1998's The Thin Red Line twenty years later.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2016, the United States Embassy in Iraq {{warned of}} a [...] "serious and unprecedented" [...] {{danger of the}} dam {{collapsing}} and suggested that plans for evacuation should be made, as the cities Mosul, Tikrit, Samarra, and Baghdad could be at risk {{in the event of}} collapse, and that up to 1.5 million people could be killed due to the ensuing flash floods. The Prime Minister of Iraq, Haider al-Abadi, repeated these concerns, and called for citizens in Mosul to evacuate and move at least 3.5 miles away from the river, a proposal that was criticized by Professor al-Ansari: “What are all these people, millions of people, supposed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> get 6km away? There is no support for them there. Nothing to help them live.” ...|$|E
2500|$|James W. Hudspeth, an {{investigator}} {{of a previous}} near accident (an MD-83, starting from Lanzarote) that was similar in its details, {{pointed out that the}} fuse of the so-called [...] "left ground control relay" [...] at position K-33 of the control panel might have been the actual culprit in the erroneous flight mode: Hudspeth found out during a 2-week investigation at Lanzarote that it is customary in normal maintenance routine to temporarily remove this fuse to engage flight mode, but the fuse is afterwards sometimes not replaced correctly. Because of the frequent handling of this fuse, it is also not easy to visually check that the fuse is functioning properly (as is customary for the pilots <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> enter the cockpit). Hudspeth speculates that this may have happened with both JK 5022 and Northwest Airlines Flight 255.|$|E
