25|$|Cage persuaded {{his parents}} that {{a trip to}} Europe would be more {{beneficial}} to a future writer than college studies. He subsequently hitchhiked to Galveston and sailed to Le Havre, where he took a train to Paris. Cage stayed in Europe for some 18 months, <b>trying</b> <b>his</b> hand at various forms of art. First he studied Gothic and Greek architecture, but decided he was not interested enough in architecture to dedicate his life to it. He then took up painting, poetry and music. It was in Europe that, encouraged by his teacher Lazare Lévy, he first heard the music of contemporary composers (such as Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith) and finally {{got to know the}} music of Johann Sebastian Bach, which he had not experienced before.|$|E

At first approaching the subject through Plato's Republic, he soon turned to contemporary ideas of socialism as expressed by the recently formed Fabian Society and free lectures delivered at Kelmscott House, the home of William Morris. He was also among the founders of The Science School Journal, a school magazine that allowed him to express his views on literature and society, as well as <b>trying</b> <b>his</b> hand at fiction; a precursor to his novel The Time Machine was published in the journal under the title The Chronic Argonauts.

Takeda Sōkaku, the founder of Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, also studied with Sakakibara at Kurumazaka.|$|E
500|$|At Paleyfest {{in early}} 2007, Steve Carell later {{recalled}} that {{he enjoyed the}} episode [...] "because it spoke {{to the fact that}} Michael is not a homophobe; he just doesn't understand the world. They are two very different things. It's not that he's intrinsically racist or homophobic or sexist, he just doesn't have a frame of reference. He's not capable of understanding. And once he does glean some understanding he misinterprets it into something altogether. But I think at least the way I feel about the character is he's a decent heart, a decent person and he's just <b>trying</b> <b>his</b> best." ...|$|E

Halstead was willing to take him on permanently at an increase in salary if he would give up the law, but Taft declined. In October 1880, Taft was appointed assistant prosecutor for Hamilton County (where Cincinnati is located), and took office the following January. [...] Taft served for a year as assistant prosecutor, <b>trying</b> <b>his</b> share of routine cases. He resigned in January 1882 after President Chester A. Arthur appointed him Collector of Internal Revenue for Ohio's First District, an area centered on Cincinnati. [...] Taft refused to dismiss competent employees who were politically out of favor, and resigned effective in March 1883, writing to Arthur that he wished to begin private practice in Cincinnati. In 1884, Taft campaigned for the Republican candidate for president, Maine Senator James G. Blaine, who lost to New York Governor Grover Cleveland.|$|E
500|$|Amidst these drastic changes, large {{proportions}} of the freshmen classes (some as high as 30%) contained all-state high school band members. As the band's experience and musical talents grew, {{the quality of the}} music improved dramatically. Haney even rewrote the drills to include a portion where the band stopped moving and played to the audience. This innovation was well received and became a staple of the band's repertoire. In 1975, at a televised game versus the University of Arkansas, the Aggie Band was repeatedly asked to play music during lulls in the game. By the fourth quarter, the Aggie Band had played on TV during every break and Colonel Haney, <b>trying</b> <b>his</b> best to be fair, told the cameraman that they really should let the Razorback Band play a little too. The cameraman called up to the broadcast booth to get guidance and then replied, [...] "The director doesn't want to hear the Arkansas band, he wants to hear the Aggie Band." ...|$|E

Every time you get a big storyline and lots of scripts, it's fantastic– there's lots to sink your teeth into. Myself, Jamie and Tony Discipline sat down and spoke about the scenes beforehand, discussing {{how we were going}} to perform them. It's like taking on a new project, so every time I get a new storyline, I'm hands-on and ready to go for it." [...] On the scenes involving Anthony, Tyler and Derek, Lapinskas said, [...] "I think it was definitely a shock for them to see his true colours! Anthony was really worried as he didn't want them to get into trouble, so as we saw, he was <b>trying</b> <b>his</b> best {{to get them out of}} it. But even though they were scared of Derek, Anthony and Tyler are brothers and they've got each other's backs, so it was nice that we saw them standing up to Derek in some of the scenes." ...|$|E

500|$|Havers said Lewis was {{a changed}} man who wanted to apologise to those he had hurt and to make amends. He said, [...] "There's always that danger Lewis could fall back into his old ways, and he is down to his last penny. But at the moment, Lewis is <b>trying</b> <b>his</b> hardest and has no ulterior motive— just {{an awful lot of}} ice to break instead!" [...] Lewis returns the money he took from Peter, adding an extra {{thousand}} pounds as compensation. Havers said that Lewis feels desperately bad about what he did. Upon entering the Rovers, Lewis is punched by Deirdre. [...] Havers stated that Lewis wants Audrey to forgive him and [...] give him a second chance. Lewis finds Audrey charming and honest and he likes being mothered by her to an extent. Havers said that Lewis did fall in love with Audrey while they were together, but no one believes him as he has told so many lies, and thought Lewis' one redeeming feature was not taking Audrey's money when he had the chance. Havers added, [...] "He's been feeling terrible because he did the dirty on her and he wants to make amends." ...|$|E
500|$|Contrary to {{the general}} consensus, Newman's biographer Lawrence J.

[...] However, Quirk added that Newman's performance was stronger in the second half and said that [...] "to be fair to Newman, he was <b>trying</b> <b>his</b> damnedest to play an impossible part, since Luke is a convict's rationalization fantasy and never a real character." [...] Some authors have criticized the film's depiction of prison life at the time. In a review entitled [...] "Sheer Beauty in the Wrong Place," [...] Life, while praising the film's photography, [...] criticized the influence of the visual styles in the depictions of the prison camp. The magazine declared that the landscapes turned it into [...] "a rest camp (in which) the men are getting plenty of sleep, food and healthy outdoor exercise," [...] that despite the presence of the guards showed that there were [...] "worse ways to pay one's debt with society." [...] Ron Clooney also remarked that prisons [...] "were not hotels and certainly not the stuff of Cool Hand Luke movies." ...|$|E
