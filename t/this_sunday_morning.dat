60|$|So that, though <b>this</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> arose {{gray and}} lowering, with snow- flakes {{hovering}} through the air, there was Christmas in {{the thoughts of}} every man and woman among them--albeit it was the Christmas of wanderers and exiles in a wilderness looking back to bright home-fires across stormy waters.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why don't he write?" [...] was her question, which silenced them all. <b>This</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> {{it seemed}} to her as if she couldn't stand it any longer.

60|$|However Meg managed it, she did {{contrive}} {{that her}} mother should not go near the little parlour <b>this</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning,</b> and Anty was left alone, to receive her lover's visit.

At last, however, just as Meg was getting furious, he entered the inn.|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning,</b> {{seeing the}} frost among the tangled, still savage bushes of Sardinia, my soul thrilled again. This {{was not all}} known. This was not all worked out. Life {{was not only a}} process of rediscovering backwards. It is that, also: and it is that intensely. Italy has given me back I know not what of myself, but a very, very great deal. She has found for me so much that was lost: like a {{restored}} Osiris. But this morning in the omnibus I realize that, apart from the great rediscovery backwards, which one must make before one can be whole at all, there is a move forwards. There are unknown, unworked lands where the salt has not lost its savour. But one must have perfected oneself in the great past first.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Doran {{was very}} anxious indeed <b>this</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning.</b> He had made two {{attempts}} to shave but his hand {{had been so}} unsteady {{that he had been}} obliged to desist. Three days' reddish beard fringed his jaws and every two or three minutes a mist gathered on his glasses so that he had to take them off and polish them with his pocket-handkerchief. The recollection of his confession of the night before was a cause of acute pain to him; the priest had drawn out every ridiculous detail of the affair and in the end had so magnified his sin that he was almost thankful at being afforded a loophole of reparation. The harm was done. What could he do now but marry her or run away? He could not brazen it out. The affair would be sure to be talked of and his employer would be certain to hear of it. Dublin is such a small city: everyone knows everyone else's business. He felt his heart leap warmly in his throat as he heard in his excited imagination old Mr. Leonard calling out in his rasping voice: [...] "Send Mr. Doran here, please." ...|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile I had {{definitely}} {{decided not}} to be a lawyer, and it happened in <b>this</b> way. One <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> as I was walking toward school, I met a young man named Lohr, a law student several years older than myself, who turned and walked with me for a few blocks.|$|R

60|$|There are men {{standing}} about, {{with their hands}} in their pockets,--those {{who are not in}} costume. Some wear the black-and-white. All wear the stocking caps. And all have the wide shirt-breasts, white, their waistcoats being just like evening dress waistcoats. Imagine one of these soft white shirt fronts well slobbered, and you have mine host of the Risveglio. But these lounging, static, white-breasted men are snowily clean, <b>this</b> being <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning.</b> They smoke their pipes on the frosty air, and are none too friendly.|$|R
6000|$|Ayala {{had been}} a week at Stalham, and {{according}} to the understanding which had existed she should now have returned to Kingsbury Crescent. She had come for a week, and she had had her week. Oh, what a week it had been, so thoroughly happy, without a cloud, filled full with ecstatic pleasures! Jonathan Stubbs had become to her the pleasantest of friends. Lady Albury had covered her with caresses and little presents. Nina was the most perfect of friends. Sir Harry had never been cross, except for that one moment in the wood. And as for Sprite,--Sprite had nearly realised her idea of an Angel of Light. Oh, how happy she had been! She was to return on the Monday, having thus comprised two Sundays within her elongated week. She knew that her heaven was to be at an end; but she was grateful, and was determined in her gratitude to be happy and cheerful to the close. But early on <b>this</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> Colonel Stubbs spoke a word to Lady Albury. [...] "That little girl is so thoroughly happy here. Cannot you prolong it for her just for another three days?" ...|$|E
60|$|On Easter Sunday, {{as well as}} on the {{preceding}} Thursday, the Pope bestows his benediction on the people, from the balcony in front of St. Peter's. This Easter Sunday was a day so bright and blue: so cloudless, balmy, wonderfully bright: that all the previous bad weather vanished from the recollection in a moment. I had seen the Thursday's Benediction dropping damply on some hundreds of umbrellas, but there was not a sparkle then, in all the hundred fountains of Rome--such fountains as they are!--and on <b>this</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> they were running diamonds. The miles of miserable streets through which we drove (compelled to a certain course by the Pope's dragoons: the Roman police on such occasions) were so full of colour, that nothing in them was capable of wearing a faded aspect. The common people came out in their gayest dresses; the richer people in their smartest vehicles; Cardinals rattled to the church of the Poor Fishermen in their state carriages; shabby magnificence flaunted its thread-bare liveries and tarnished cocked hats, in the sun; and every coach in Rome was put in requisition for the Great Piazza of St. Peter's.|$|E
6000|$|Something {{like this}} sense of {{enlarged}} being was in Adam's mind <b>this</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning,</b> as he rode along in vivid recollection of the past. His feeling towards Dinah, the hope of passing his life with her, had been the distant unseen point towards which that hard journey from Snowfield eighteen months ago had been leading him. Tender and deep as his love for Hetty had been--so deep that the roots of {{it would never be}} torn away--his love for Dinah was better and more precious to him, for it was the outgrowth of that fuller life which had come to him from his acquaintance with deep sorrow. [...] "It's like {{as if it was a}} new strength to me," [...] he said to himself, [...] "to love her and know as she loves me. I shall look t' her to help me to see things right. For she's better than I am--there's less o' self in her, and pride. And it's a feeling as gives you a sort o' liberty, as if you could walk more fearless, when you've more trust in another than y' have in yourself. I've always been thinking I knew better than them as belonged to me, and that's a poor sort o' life, when you can't look to them nearest to you t' help you with a bit better thought than what you've got inside you a'ready." ...|$|E
50|$|He was {{planning}} to enter the ministry, when a sudden loss of voice forced him {{to embark on a}} new path. He said of <b>this</b> incident:One <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> I stood before an audience {{in the middle of an}} address, unable to speak a word. The horror of those moments has never been blotted from my memory. The failure was a climax of several years of misuse of my voice, though during that time I had sought help from every available source. I determined to search still more diligently to find the causes of my condition.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You were {{stamping}} {{your little}} foot, my dear, and screaming with your little voice, and laying into me with your little bonnet, which you had snatched {{off for the}} purpose,' returned her father, as if the remembrance gave a relish to the rum; 'you were doing <b>this</b> one <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> when I took you out, because I didn't go the exact way you wanted, when the old gentleman, sitting on a seat near, said, [...] "That's a nice girl; that's a VERY nice girl; a promising girl!"

50|$|The Church of England parish {{church of}} Saints Peter and Paul stands {{apart from the}} village, high on the hill {{overlooking}} it. Prime Ministers have often attended <b>this</b> church for <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> worship when in residence at Chequers. Tony Blair, however, followed {{his wife and children}} to their Roman Catholic church in Great Missenden. Margaret Thatcher was famously known to have prayed at Ellesborough church, finding comfort during the Falklands War.|$|R
6000|$|Everything on <b>this</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> was pleasant, or {{apparently}} pleasant, at Croker's Hall. In the evening, when Mary and the maid-servants went to church, leaving Mrs Baggett {{at home to}} {{look after}} the house and go to sleep, Mr Whittlestaff walked off to the wooded path with his Horace. He did not read it very long. The bits which he did usually read never amounted to much at a time. He would take a few lines and then digest them thoroughly, wailing over them or rejoicing, as the case might be. He was not at the present moment much given to joy. [...] "Intermissa, Venus, diu rursus bella moves? Parce, precor, precor." [...] This was the passage to which he turned at the present moment; and very little was the consolation which he found in it. What was so crafty, he said to himself, or so vain as that an old man should hark back to the pleasures of a time of life which was past and gone! [...] "Non sum qualis eram," [...] he said, and then thought with shame of the time when he had been jilted by Catherine Bailey,--the time in which he had certainly been young enough to love and be loved, had he been as lovable as he had been prone to love. Then he put the book in his pocket. His latter effort had been to recover something of the sweetness of life, and not, as had been the poet's, to drain those dregs to the bottom. But when he got home he bade Mary tell him what Mr Lowlad had said in his sermon, and was quite cheery in his manner of picking Mr Lowlad's theology to pieces;--for Mr Whittlestaff did not altogether agree with Mr Lowlad as to the uses to be made of the Sabbath.|$|E
6000|$|Your hearts, I know, {{would have}} been melted if you had had a view [...] of us <b>this</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning.</b> I went {{directly}} after breakfast for the [...] boys, and though H. had an [...] "iron stomach-ache," [...] as he called it, we [...] went off together to that low wooded hill which the Aunt could see [...] from her window when you were here, and walked about till [...] dinner-time, H. being all the while in great pain. In one part we [...] found a platform with a stone bench commanding {{a view of the}} whole [...] valley, and, as we were rather tired, sat down on it, H. and Wilky [...] each with a Once a Week, while I tried to draw the view in my [...] pocket-book. We wondered what our beloved parents were doing at [...] that moment, 11.30, and thought you must all have been in your [...] salon, Alice at the window with her eyes fixed on her novel, but [...] eating some rich fruit that Father has just brought in for her from [...] the Palais Royal, and the lovely Mother and Aunt in armchairs, [...] their hands crossed in front of them, listening to Father, who [...] walks up and down talking of the superiority of America to these [...] countries after all, and how much better it is we should have done [...] with them. We wished, oh we wished we could have been with you to [...] join in the conversation and partake of the fruit. We got up from [...] the seat and went on with a heavy sigh, but in a way so fraternal, [...] presenting such a sweet picture of brotherly unitedness and [...] affection, that it would have done you good to see us.|$|E
6000|$|What would Ludovic Valcarm do next? He might {{remain there}} all day before {{she would go to}} him. He was now {{standing}} under the front of the centre gable, and was out of Linda's sight. There was a low window close to him where he stood, which opened from the passage that ran through the middle of the house. On {{the other side of this}} passage, opposite to the parlour which Madame Staubach occupied, was a large room not now used, and filled with lumber. Linda, as soon as she was aware that Ludovic was in the island, within a few feet of her, and that something must be done, retreated from the parlour back into the kitchen, and, as she went, thoughtfully drew the bolt of the front door. But she had not thought of the low window into the passage, which in these summer days was always opened, nor, if she had thought of it, could she have taken any precaution in that direction. To have attempted to close the window would have been to throw herself into the young man's arms. But there was a bolt inside the kitchen door, and that she drew. Then she stood in the middle of the room listening. Had this been a thief who had come when she was left in charge of the house, is it thus she would have protected her own property and her aunt's? It was no thief. But why should she run from this man whom she knew,--whom she knew and would have trusted had she been left to her own judgment of him? She was no coward. Were she to face the man, she would fear no personal danger from him. He would offer her no insult, and she thought that she could protect herself, even were he to insult her. It was not that that she feared,--but that her aunt should be able to say that she had received her lover in secret on <b>this</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning,</b> when she had pretended that she was too ill to go to church! ...|$|E
5000|$|The second flood {{occurred}} {{less than}} a year later in May 1932; again intense rainfall caused the brook to overflow, with considerable flooding throughout the central shopping quarter. A contemporary account recalls that; [...] "Water poured into the streets and many houses were filled to a depth of six or seven feet. In the low-lying parts of the town it gathered quickly and, by ten o’clock on <b>this</b> memorable <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning,</b> shops in the Cornmarket, St James’s Street and the bottom end of St Peter’s Street were immersed half-way up the windows. The centre of town presented the appearance of a lake and the sight was unforgettable." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the mean}} time he rose, and, invigorated by his bath, his {{thoughts}} became in a slight degree more mundane. They recurred {{to the events}} of the last few days of his life, but in a spirit of self-reproach and of conscious vanity and weakness. Why, he had not known her a week! <b>This</b> was <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning,</b> and last <b>Sunday</b> he had attended St. Mary's and offered up his earnest supplications for the unity of Christendom. That was then his sovereign hope and thought. Singular that a casual acquaintance with a stranger, a look, a glance, a word, a nothing, should have so disturbed his spirit and distracted his mind.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a bright}} autumn Sunday, sixteen years after Silas Marner had found his new {{treasure}} on the hearth. The bells of the old Raveloe church were ringing the cheerful peal which told that the morning service was ended; {{and out of the}} arched doorway in the tower came slowly, retarded by friendly greetings and questions, the richer parishioners who had chosen <b>this</b> bright <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> as eligible for church-going. It was the rural fashion of that time for the more important members of the congregation to depart first, while their humbler neighbours waited and looked on, stroking their bent heads or dropping their curtsies to any large ratepayer who turned to notice them.|$|R
6000|$|He says, [...] "That's good." [...] He {{has a great}} {{bundle of}} white oak bark under his arm for a sick man, {{gathered}} <b>this</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning.</b> [...] "I suppose there's no harm in going after such a thing to-day," [...] says he. To him Homer was a great writer, though what his writing was about he did not know. A more simple and natural man {{it would be hard}} to find. Vice and disease, which cast such a sombre moral hue over the world, seemed to have hardly any existence for him. He was about twenty-eight years old, and had left Canada and his father's house a dozen years before to work in the States, and earn money to buy a farm with at last, perhaps in his native country. He was cast in the coarsest mould; a stout but sluggish body, yet gracefully carried, with a thick sunburnt neck, dark bushy hair, and dull sleepy blue eyes, which were occasionally lit up with expression. He wore a flat gray cloth cap, a dingy wool-colored greatcoat, and cowhide boots. He was a great consumer of meat, usually carrying his dinner to his work a couple of miles past my house--for he chopped all summer--in a tin pail; cold meats, often cold woodchucks, and coffee in a stone bottle which dangled by a string from his belt; and sometimes he offered me a drink. He came along early, crossing my bean-field, though without anxiety or haste to get to his work, such as Yankees exhibit. He wasn't a-going to hurt himself. He didn't care if he only earned his board. Frequently he would leave his dinner in the bushes, when his dog had caught a woodchuck by the way, and go back a mile and a half to dress it and leave it in the cellar of the house where he boarded, after deliberating first for half an hour whether he could not sink it in the pond safely till nightfall--loving to dwell long upon these themes. He would say, as he went by in the morning, [...] "How thick the pigeons are! If working every day were not my trade, I could get all the meat I should want by hunting-pigeons, woodchucks, rabbits, partridges--by gosh! I could get all I should want for a week in one day." ...|$|E

2500|$|The best-known and oldest {{distinction}} between Open and Exclusive assemblies {{is in the}} nature of relationships among their local churches. Open Brethren assemblies function as networks of like-minded independent local churches.

Disciplinary action normally involves denying the individual participation in the breaking of bread or Lord's table. Generally, <b>this</b> is a <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> service of prayer, singing, teaching, and taking communion, with important assembly-related announcements given at the end.
