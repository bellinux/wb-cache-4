25|$|The {{ancestors}} of the <b>Trần</b> clan originated from the province of Fujian before they migrated under <b>Trần</b> Kính (陳京, Chén Jīng) to Đại Việt, where their mixed-blooded descendants established the <b>Trần</b> dynasty which ruled Đại Việt. The descendants of the <b>Trần</b> clan who came to rule Đại Việt were of mixed-blooded descent due to many intermarriages between the <b>Trần</b> and several royal members of the Lý dynasty alongside members of their royal court {{as in the case}} of <b>Trần</b> Lý and <b>Trần</b> Thừa, the latter whose son <b>Trần</b> Thái Tông would later become the first emperor of the <b>Trần</b> dynasty. Their descendants established the <b>Tran</b> dynasty, which ruled Vietnam (Dai Viet). Some of the mixed-blooded descendants and certain members of the clan could still speak Chinese, as when a Yuan dynasty envoy met with the Chinese-speaking <b>Tran</b> Prince <b>Trần</b> Quốc Tuấn in 1282.

Although a son of Thái Tông in name, <b>Trần</b> Quốc Khang's father was {{actually}} Prince Hoài <b>Trần</b> Liễu, who was forced by grand chancellor <b>Trần</b> Thủ Độ {{to give up his}} wife, Princess Thuận Thiên, to his younger brother Thái Tông when she was already pregnant with <b>Trần</b> Quốc Khang. For this reason, <b>Trần</b> Quốc Khang was not chosen as successor of Thái Tông for the throne and {{he did not have a}} significant role in royal court either, as his younger brothers did. Afterwards he was appointed as governor of Nghệ An, a position that his descendants inherited. Since <b>Trần</b> Quốc Khang was in fact a son of <b>Trần</b> Liễu, he was also a natural brother of general <b>Trần</b> Hưng Đạo, commander-in-chief of Đại Việt army.|$|R

Before his death, <b>Trần</b> Liễu made his son Prince Hưng Đạo <b>Trần</b> Quốc Tuấn promise to revenge for him by taking over the throne but due to the situation of Đại Việt when the <b>Trần</b> Dynasty had to face with three consecutive invasions from the Yuan Dynasty, <b>Trần</b> Quốc Tuấn preferred keeping a harmony between him and Prince Chiêu Minh <b>Trần</b> Quang Khải who was the other commander of Đại Việt's army and also a member of <b>Trần</b> Cảnh's line.|$|R

50|$|In October 1224, Lý Huệ Tông {{decided to}} cede the throne to his daughter, the Princess Chiêu Thánh, now the Empress Regnant Lý Chiêu Hoàng.
