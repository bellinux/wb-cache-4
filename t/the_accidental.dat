5|$|Before {{discovering}} that the incident had {{been caused by}} <b>the</b> <b>accidental</b> launch of two torpedoes by a drunken German crewman on the E-boat S-13, the German authorities in Bergen launched a search for saboteurs in the city. Kommandøren was the only total loss suffered by Fylkesbaatane i Sogn og Fjordane (the formerly named Nordre Bergenhus Amts Dampskibe) during the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, an {{increasing}} number of products used for everyday life proved to be poisonous. The risk of being poisoned nowadays lies more in <b>the</b> <b>accidental</b> factor, where poison be induced or taken by accident. Poisoning is the 4th most common cause of death within young people. Accidental ingestions are most common in children less than 5 years old.|$|E
5|$|One of the depot's wartime {{commanding}} officers was Wing Commander John Lerew, {{who held}} the post from December 1942 until November 1943. During his tenure, after investigating the crash of a Vultee Vengeance, he designed a clip to prevent <b>the</b> <b>accidental</b> release of the pilot's safety harness, which was later adopted for all such harnesses. By January 1945, No.1 AD's strength had increased to its highest level of 2,339 staff.|$|E

5|$|Shoup began a brief {{assignment}} as Inspector General for Recruit Training in May 1956 {{after being}} ordered {{to do so}} by Commandant Randolph M. Pate following the Ribbon Creek incident, which involved <b>the</b> <b>accidental</b> drowning of six recruits during a training march. As Marine leaders were investigating, they favored Shoup's recommendation of not covering up the incident. He supported an overhaul of recruit training for the Marine Corps in response.|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble {{assumption is}} {{also consistent with}} <b>the</b> <b>accidental</b> production of arterial bubbles. One scenario considers a shunt at the heart or lung level that passes bubbles from the venous to the arterial side. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is thought to only open in certain conditions. A PFO conveniently explains neurological accidents after recreational air diving without any procedure violation, but it does not explain vestibular hits in deep diving. Vestibular symptoms can appear very early in the decompression, long before the massive bubble production required to overload the system.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} involved <b>the</b> <b>accidental</b> triggering of a {{fire extinguishing}} system which sealed two forward compartments and released Halon 2402 (freon R-114B2), dibromotetrafluoroethane gas into them. According to survivors, those affected by the gas release were caught off guard and {{may not have been}} alerted in time due to warning sirens sounding only after the gas had already begun pouring in. Some of the victims were reported to have been unable to turn on breathing kits before they suffocated.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{many other}} oceanic islands, Inaccessible Island has {{remained}} free from introduced predators, allowing this species to flourish while many other flightless birds, particularly flightless rails, have gone extinct.

5|$|A CRA poll {{released}} in March 2010 showed {{public support for}} Williams' Progressive Conservative Party that had extended to a record 80 percent of decided voters, up from 77 percent from February. Satisfaction with the government was 93 percent voters. After controversies arose surrounding <b>the</b> <b>accidental</b> expropriation of the Grand Falls-Windsor paper mill and the province's readiness to react to a possible oil spill, the Williams led government {{as well as his}} personal popularity took a slight hit. A CRA poll conducted in May 2010, showed that satisfaction with the government was at 87 percent down from 93 percent in March, the party's support had fallen five percent to 75 percent and Williams own support fell to 79 percent down from 81 percent. Even with the slight loss in support Williams remains by far the most popular provincial or federal leader in the country.|$|E
5|$|A gallery feature {{was also}} planned and would allow players to unlock bonus {{material}} {{depending on their}} progression in the game. Fan artwork and music would be unlockable through this feature, as well as minigames, including a card game similar to Triple Triad from Final Fantasy VIII. The remake {{was expected to be}} released on the Internet for free and played on console emulators, since there would be no cartridge version due to financial constraints. Only a semi-working 3D test was actually completed, and the project was discontinued in mid-2000 due to a number of factors, including <b>the</b> <b>accidental</b> loss of Lazur's data and his desire to improve his programming skills.|$|E

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>accidental</b> release, another {{radiological}} survey was performed, {{and the state}} government concluded that PermaGrain needed to be relocated. The DCNR made the policy decision that Quehanna Wild Area would be closed to industrial uses. After looking at multiple sites with Clearfield County development authorities, a new site for PermaGrain Products was purchased, and the company submitted its {{plans for a new}} building and license to the NRC in October 2001. In order to approve the move to the new site, the NRC required PermaGrain to provide an inventory of all their cobalt-60 sources, dispose of a damaged source, and dispose of any other sources not mechanically certified. However in late December 2002, PermaGrain filed for bankruptcy under Chapter Seven. PermaGrain had employed 135 people in 1988 and 80 in 1995.|$|E
5|$|After the convention, {{support for}} Nasjonal Samling, and Quisling {{personal}}ly, ebbed away. Increased factionalism and personal losses, including <b>the</b> <b>accidental</b> death of fellow politician Gulbrand Lunde, were compounded by heavy-handed German tactics, {{such as the}} shooting of ten well-known residents of Trøndelag and its environs in October 1942. In addition, the lex Eilifsen ex-post facto law of August 1943, {{which led to the}} first death sentence passed by the regime, was widely seen as a blatant violation of the Constitution and a sign of Norway's increasing role in the Final Solution, would destroy everything the convention had achieved in terms of boosting party morale.|$|E
5|$|Because vaquitas are {{indigenous}} to the Gulf of California, Mexico is leading conservation efforts {{with the creation}} of the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA), which has tried to prevent <b>the</b> <b>accidental</b> deaths of vaquitas by outlawing the use of fishing nets within the vaquita's habitat. CIRVA has worked together with the CITES, the Endangered Species Act, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) to nurse the vaquita population back to a point at which they can sustain themselves. CIRVA concluded in 2000 that between 39 and 84 individuals are killed each year by such gillnets. In order to try to prevent extinction, the Mexican government has created a nature reserve covering {{the upper part of the}} Gulf of California and the Colorado River delta. They have also placed a temporary ban on fishing, with compensation to those affected, that may pose a threat to the vaquita.|$|E
50|$|Paul Tate {{took up the}} Directorship of <b>the</b> <b>Accidentals</b> in 1993 and {{proceeded}} to whip the 12 members into shape. That year also brought about a landmark event: the Accidentals' first album, On The Map, which was only available on cassette, and sold out quickly. The group put out their second album the next year: S.O.L.D. O.U.T. (Songs Of Liberty, Devotion, and Other Universal Truths). The album was a great improvement over On The Map and gave <b>the</b> <b>Accidentals</b> a more polished and professional sound. The next year brought the Accidentals' third album in three years: Songs From Uncle Paul's Cabin.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Accidentals</b> {{were formed}} in 1974 when the Director of The University of Georgia Men's University of Georgia Men's Glee Club, Dr. E. Pierce Arant, Jr. decided to liven up the concerts a bit {{by having a}} feature quartet. Over time the quartet grew to eight members, then twelve. In the mid-1980s Paul Tate joined the group and began to arrange more {{contemporary}} pop music for the group, a big change from the typical barbershop and spiritual music the group was used to doing with the Men's Glee Club. <b>The</b> <b>Accidentals</b> were widely heralded for their 1992 performance of [...] "A Mighty Fortress" [...] as arranged by the group Glad.|$|R

5|$|Beetle remains bearing what {{appeared}} to be the marks of bird attacks have been found by the River Ouse and hardened adults often bear symmetrically indented elytra, interpreted as 'pinch marks' inflicted by a beak whilst newly emerged adults are still hardening. Dead beetles have also been found in the webs of spiders in a captive population. <b>The</b> <b>accidental</b> predation of C. graminis by livestock consuming the tansy plant is also possible. Predation of a larva by the scorpionfly Panorpa germanica has been observed in the field. The tachinid genus Macquartia exclusively parasitizes Chrysolmelid beetles and one species of which, Macquartia dispar, may parasitise C. graminis directly. The adult fly deposits fully incubated eggs or newly hatched larvae into the vicinity of the host larvae.|$|E
5|$|Finney {{disagreed}} with <b>the</b> <b>accidental</b> voyaging portion of Sharp's hypothesis. To investigate the problem, {{he founded the}} Polynesian Voyaging Society with Herb Kane and Tommy Holmes in 1973, intent on building a voyaging canoe to sail from Hawaii to Tahiti to test whether intentional two-way voyaging throughout Oceania could be replicated. With the help of Mau's navigational knowledge guiding Hōkūle‘a, the Polynesian Voyaging Society demonstrated that intentional voyaging was not only possible, but also the ancestors of the Polynesians could have settled the Pacific on similar voyages using non-instrument wayfinding techniques such as Mau's. Finally, linguistic and archaeological {{evidence suggests that the}} history of the Polynesian people does not originate in the East Pacific but in the West. Recent developments in the field of DNA analysis have unequivocally settled the debate of Polynesian origin. They prove Polynesians share common ancestry with indigenous Taiwanese and East Asians.|$|E
5|$|He saved {{money and}} his father helped him out to buy a drum kit made by a Japanese toy company, which was for sale by {{a friend of his}} sister Cecilia. He set up the kit in his bedroom and his parents gave him certain times to practice. Then his father got him into the Post Office Workers Band, which played orchestral melodies with percussion, along with marching band standards. He {{attended}} Scoil Colmcille, Marlborough Street, Dublin. He took the exams for Chanel College and St. Paul's, two Catholic schools his father wanted his son to attend. After <b>the</b> <b>accidental</b> death of Larry's younger sister in 1973, his father gave up the idea of pushing his son into those schools and sent Larry to Mount Temple Comprehensive School, the first interdenominational school in Ireland.|$|E
