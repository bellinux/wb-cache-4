50|$|This {{invention}} is {{an improvement}} to the sewing needle, {{by making it}} possible <b>to</b> <b>thread</b> the <b>needle</b> with one hand for efficiency.

60|$|When we try {{to perform}} some little action which is {{difficult}} and requires precision, for instance, <b>to</b> <b>thread</b> a <b>needle,</b> we generally close our lips firmly, for the sake, I presume, of not disturbing our movements by breathing; and I noticed the same action in a young Orang. The poor little creature was sick, and was amusing itself by trying to kill the flies on the window-panes with its knuckles; this was difficult as the flies buzzed about, and at each attempt the lips were firmly compressed, {{and at the same}} time slightly protruded.|$|R

5000|$|Since a humanâ€™s {{two eyes}} are {{approximately}} 6.5 cm apart, {{they see the}} world from different viewpoints: the image projected on the left retina is slightly different from the image projected on the right.

Abraham Solomon's, exhibited at the Royal Academy summer exhibition of 1858, depicted a grey-haired warrior in uniform trying <b>to</b> <b>thread</b> the <b>needle</b> of a lady seated beside him on a sofa, while the one by Emile Pierre Metzmacher (1815-1905), exhibited at the Exposition Universelle (1889), was a period piece in which a younger soldier tries his hand at tapestry.|$|R

5000|$|Kyle Davies, {{domestic}} distribution {{chief for}} Paramount, felt the controversy around the casting had damaged reviews, and said: [...] "You're always trying <b>to</b> <b>thread</b> that <b>needle</b> between honoring the source material {{and make a}} movie for a mass audience. That's challenging, but clearly the reviews didn't help." [...] Conversely, Deadline argued that the negative critical assessment was instead due to the film being [...] "cold, boring, thoughtless, and the same old same old next to its futuristic ancestors The Matrix and Blade Runner" [...] and suggested that Paramount held the film from review because they [...] "knew they had a lame duck." [...] Deadline also reported that the film is expected to lose at least $60 million against its total advertising and production costs of $250 million.|$|R

40|$|Whereas {{many animals}} have eyes located {{on either side}} of their head (such as horses, for example), the eyes of humans look {{forwards}} - in the same direction. When normal, the eyes move in a coordinated manner, so that the object being looked at is centred in each eye. Because the eyes are set a small distance apart, the image in each eye is slightly different. The brain fuses the images coming from both eyes to produce a three-dimensional image that has depth. This three-dimensional vision, also known as stereoscopic or binocular vision, gives us depth perception. This allows us to judge distances more accurately, especially with objects close to us. Try <b>to</b> <b>thread</b> a <b>needle</b> with only one eye open and you will see the advantage of binocular vision...|$|R

"The {{genius of}} Tulku Urgyen {{was that he}} could point out the nature of mind with {{precision}} and matter-of-factness of teaching a person how <b>to</b> <b>thread</b> a <b>needle</b> and could get an ordinary meditator like me to recognize that consciousness is intrinsically free of self... I came to Tulku Urgyen yearning for the experience of self-transcendence, and in a few minutes he showed me I had no self to transcend... After a few minutes, Tulku Urgyen simply handed me the ability to cut through the illusion of the self directly, even in ordinary states of consciousness. This instruction was, without question, the most important thing I have ever been explicitly taught by another human being. It has given me a way to escape the usual tides of psychological suffering - fear, anger, shame - in an instant." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{story begins}} with Alice busily talking {{to herself as}} she {{continuously}} tries <b>to</b> <b>thread</b> a <b>needle</b> through. <b>To</b> her dismay she continues to fail at this and she takes an extremely close look when she finds herself gliding through the air in an unknown world. She mentions how it was December at her previous whereabouts and how in Needle's Eye World it seemed to have a pleasant summer-ish feel to the place. When she finally falls to the ground she is cushioned by a haystack. When she emerges, she hears a distant call for [...] "'elp". Alice soon discovers that they were the small whimpers of a Country Mouse, who believes that she is a comet. The Country mouse hereafter befriends Alice and informs her that she is not in a haystack, but an A-stack, or rather a messy pile of A's. She spots a few spelling bees, makes her way out of the haystack and continues in the direction of which she recalls seeing a beach from when she was flying.|$|R

I had not, as I suppose, been out more than ten minutes when the attack from which I had suffered in my room was renewed. There was no shop near in which I could take refuge. I tried to ring the bell of the nearest house door. Before I could reach it I fainted in the street.|$|R
5000|$|Code Red has {{received}} generally mixed reviews from music critics. Jon Caramanica of New York Times {{felt that the}} Code Red [...] "manifests in the tension between traditionalist instincts and modern music-making imperatives". He also noted that its sound reflects [...] "choices of an artist trying <b>to</b> <b>thread</b> several <b>needles</b> at once". Knoxville News Sentinel writer Chuck Campbell gave the album four stars out of five. While he complimented her collaborations with Lil Wayne, Elliott, and Timbaland, he stated that [...] "Monica fares best on Code Red when she goes it alone at the microphone with her powerful pipes", making [...] "a good case for reviving R&B with Code Red." [...] Michael Arceneaux, writing for Ebony, declared Code Red [...] "an enjoyable listen", praising it as [...] "Monicaâ€™s best album in years, and a reminder {{that when you have}} a format that works for you, stick with it and stop swerving". He noted comparisons with Tamia's Love Life (2015), citing its undoubtedly [...] "awareness of current trends, and in select cases on the album, offers a nod to them without going too far left." ...|$|R
60|$|To {{the queen}} he gave six little knives, {{and a dozen}} small looking-glasses for her ladies; six pairs of scissors, and a small box full of large needles; then he gave her some coarse brown thread, and showed her how <b>to</b> <b>thread</b> the <b>needle,</b> and sew {{anything}} together with the thread; all which she admired exceedingly, and called her tawny maids of honour about her, that they might learn also. And whilst they were standing all together, our officer, to divert the king, sewed two of her women one to another by the lap of their waistcoats, or what else it might be called; {{and when they were}} a little surprised at it, and began, as he thought, to be a little uneasy, he took the scissors, and at one snap set them at liberty again, which passed for such an extraordinary piece of dexterity, that the king would needs have two of them sewed together again, on purpose to see it cut again. And then the king desired he might have a <b>needle</b> and <b>thread</b> himself, and a pair of scissors; then he would sew some things together, and cut them asunder again several times, and laugh most heartily at the ingenuity of it.|$|R

In the course of this business, there is a multitude of sheeve-holes and blocks, through which you must pass it; often the rope is a very tight fit, so as to make it like threading a fine cambric needle with rather coarse thread.

40|$|Using the 2 {{chain stitch}} sewing machine, the dynamic {{tensions}} of <b>needle</b> and looper <b>threads,</b> {{the amount of}} their threads which were fed, {{and the range of}} arm shaft turning angle when their threads were being fed, were simultaneously measured during sewing operation. The three peaks in <b>needle</b> <b>thread</b> tension curve and the two peaks in looper thread tension curve were observed, but the <b>needle</b> <b>thread</b> was fed twice and the looper thread was fed only once during a cycle of the sewing operation. As the tensions pulling out the <b>needle</b> <b>thread</b> increased, the range of arm shaft turning angle when <b>needle</b> <b>thread</b> was being fed the second time, decreased, a smaller amount of <b>needle</b> <b>threads</b> was fed and the each peak values of <b>needle</b> <b>thread</b> tension became large. Also as the tensions pulling out the looper thread increased, the same result was obtained on looper threads. However a smaller amount of <b>needle</b> <b>threads</b> was not fed the first time.
