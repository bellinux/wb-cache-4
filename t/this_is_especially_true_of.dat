5|$|Several common {{birds in}} North America, {{such as the}} house sparrow, the rock pigeon, the European {{starling}} and the mute swan are introduced species, meaning {{that they are not}} native to this continent but were brought here by humans from Europe or elsewhere. Introduced species are marked on this list as (I). There may be species that have individual escapees or small feral populations in North America that are not on this list. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> birds that are commonly held as pets, such as parrots and finches.|$|E
5|$|Several of Chicago's most {{important}} historical figures have {{lived on the}} street. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> the period of recovery from the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 when many of the {{most important}} families in the city moved to the street. Residents of the street have influenced the evolution of the city and have played prominent national and international roles. They have influenced the political history, the architecture, the culture, the economy, as well as the law and government of Chicago. The street has over time been influenced by the demographics of Chicago.|$|E
5|$|There are {{virtually}} no {{parts of the}} world left where the weapon dance is directly connected with imminent or recent combat. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> European states, which have long since moved away from the tribalism that usually gives rise to such folk dances. It is, however, also true of {{parts of the world}} where tribal traditions have succumbed to colonialism and the forces of globalism. The dances that one sees today are often part of general movements to preserve and rejuvenate tribal or local traditions. Some of these movements are quite strong now, such as those among native North American tribes and the aboriginal peoples of Australia.|$|E

5|$|Nearby {{tracts of}} habitat {{strongly}} affect the wildlife in the Balch Creek watershed. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> Forest Park, which extends into other watersheds to the northwest. Birds and animals from these watersheds {{and from the}} Tualatin River valley, the Coast Range, the Willamette River, Sauvie Island, the Columbia River, and the Vancouver, Washington, lowlands, {{move in and out}} of the park with relative ease. Sixty-two mammal species, including the northern flying squirrel, black-tailed deer, creeping vole, bobcat, coyote, Mazama pocket gopher, little brown bat, Roosevelt elk, and Pacific jumping mouse use Forest Park. blue grouse, great horned owl, hairy woodpecker, Bewick's wren, orange-crowned warbler, osprey, and hermit thrush are among the 112species of birds that frequent the area. Amphibian species seen at the Audubon Society pond include rough-skinned newts, Pacific tree frogs, and salamanders.|$|E
5|$|South of Ardnamurchan, Gaelic {{place names}} are more common, {{and after the}} 13th century, Gaelic became the main {{language}} of the entire Hebridean archipelago. Due to Scots and English being favored in government and the educational system, the Hebrides {{have been in a}} state of diglossia since at least the seventeenth century. The Highland Clearances of the nineteenth century accelerated the language shift away from Scottish Gaelic, as did increased migration and the continuing lower status of Gaelic speakers. Nevertheless, as late {{as the end of the}} nineteenth century, there were significant populations of monolingual Gaelic speakers, and the Hebrides still contain the highest percentages of Gaelic speakers in Scotland. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> the Outer Hebrides, where a slim majority speak the language. The Scottish Gaelic college, Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, is based on Skye and Islay.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the electrode core is generally similar and sometimes identical {{to that of the}} base material. But even though a number of feasible options exist, a slight difference in alloy composition can strongly impact the properties of the resulting weld. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> alloy steels such as HSLA steels. Likewise, electrodes of compositions {{similar to those of the}} base materials are often used for welding nonferrous materials like aluminium and copper. However, sometimes it is desirable to use electrodes with core materials significantly different from the base material. For example, stainless steel electrodes are sometimes used to weld two pieces of carbon steel, and are often utilized to weld stainless steel workpieces with carbon steel workpieces.|$|E

5|$|In his 2006 re-evaluation, Carpenter {{examined}} the paleobiology of giant sauropods, including Amphicoelias, and addresses {{the question of}} why this group attained such a huge size. He pointed out that gigantic sizes were reached early in sauropod evolution, with very large sized species present as early as the late Triassic Period, and concluded that whatever evolutionary pressure caused large size was present from the early origins of the group. Carpenter cited several studies of giant mammalian herbivores, such as elephants and rhinoceros, which showed that larger size in plant-eating animals leads to greater efficiency in digesting food. Since larger animals have longer digestive systems, food is kept in digestion for significantly longer periods of time, allowing large animals to survive on lower-quality food sources. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> animals with a large number of 'fermentation chambers' along the intestine which allow microbes to accumulate and ferment plant material, aiding digestion. Throughout their evolutionary history, sauropod dinosaurs were found primarily in semi-arid, seasonally dry environments, with a corresponding seasonal drop in the quality of food during the dry season. The environment of Amphicoelias was essentially a savanna, similar to the arid environments in which modern giant herbivores are found, supporting the idea that poor-quality food in an arid environment promotes the evolution of giant herbivores. Carpenter argued that other benefits of large size, such as relative immunity from predators, lower energy expenditure, and longer life span, are probably secondary advantages.|$|E

25|$|Due to Western Washington's large population, Democrats usually {{fare better}} statewide.

25|$|Canon law {{was not a}} {{finished}} product from the beginning, but rather a gradual growth. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> the earlier Christian centuries. Such written laws as existed were not originally universal laws, but local or provincial statutes. Hence arose the necessity of collecting or codifying them. Earlier collections are brief and contain few laws that are chronologically certain. Only {{with the increase of}} legislation did a methodical classification become necessary.|$|E
25|$|Under normal conditions, {{language}} {{seems to}} develop {{in a similar way}} among all children but when children grow up in a radically different environment their language is significantly different. A number of examples including wild children show that certain elements of the early environment are essential for language learning. Amala and Kamala and Genie never managed to fully progress to learning language. While these examples are extreme, they show that consumer’s language is affected by their environment. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> marketing activities across geographical borders.|$|E

25|$|In {{commercial}} forestry, the transplanting of crop {{trees in}} new locales often requires an accompanying ectomycorrhizal partner. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> trees {{that have a}} high degree of specificity for their mycobiont, or trees that are being planted far from their native habitat among novel fungal species. This has been shown time and again in plantations involving obligate ectomycorrhizal trees, such as Eucalyptus and Pinus species. Mass planting of these species often require human addition of inoculum from native EcM fungi in order for the trees to prosper.|$|E
25|$|As in many states, {{especially}} those without major league professional sport teams, college athletics are prominent. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> the state's three Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) programs, including the Kentucky Wildcats, the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers, and the Louisville Cardinals.
