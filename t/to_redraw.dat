5|$|Yet another Thayer printrun {{was needed}} in early 1853. Thayer {{was about to}} leave his Boston {{business}} for the final time, but finished the job for the Ives firm. This sixth edition resulted from another need <b>to</b> <b>redraw</b> the green printing litho stone. Green was removed from the banner and corners, and, only the blank spaces were printed in green.|$|E
5|$|By 1936 {{there was}} already a demand for reprints of Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, with Lesne sending a letter to Hergé enquiring if this was possible. The {{cartoonist}} was reluctant, stating that the original plates for the story were now in a poor condition and {{that as a result}} he would have <b>to</b> <b>redraw</b> the entire story were it to be re-published. Several years later, amid the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, a German-run publishing company asked Hergé for permission to republish Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, with the intent of using it as anti-Soviet propaganda, but again Hergé declined the offer.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, the Government {{felt that}} the best way to ensure {{minority}} representation in Parliament was to introduce the GRC scheme. In addition, it took the view that such a scheme would complement the introduction of town councils to manage public housing estates, as it would be economical for a town council to manage a group of three constituencies. Subsequently, in 1991, the Government said that GRCs also minimized the need <b>to</b> <b>redraw</b> the boundaries of constituencies which had grown too big for the MPs serving them, and, in 1996, GRCs were said to provide Community Development Councils with the critical mass of residents that they needed to be effective.|$|E
50|$|As noted above, Valhalla's {{population}} was 3,162 at the 2010 U.S. Census, an apparent decline of 2,217 that {{may reflect the}} impact of the 2006 tornado, but more likely due <b>to</b> <b>redrawing</b> of CDP borders, which can change from one census to the next.|$|R

5|$|Tod favoured the then-fashionable {{concept of}} Romantic nationalism. Influenced by this, {{he thought that}} each princely state should be {{inhabited}} by only one community and his policies were designed to expel Marathas, Pindaris and other groups from Rajput territories. It also influenced his instigation of treaties that were intended <b>to</b> <b>redraw</b> the territorial boundaries of the various states. The geographical and political boundaries before his time had in some cases been blurred, primarily due to local arrangements based on common kinship, and he wanted a more evident delineation of the entities, He was successful {{in both of these}} endeavours.|$|E
5|$|For Vorticons, Carmack {{had created}} {{adaptive}} tile refresh {{to produce a}} scrolling effect on computers not powerful enough <b>to</b> <b>redraw</b> the entire screen when the player moved. For Keen Dreams, he wanted to scroll the background at a different rate than the foreground, but again computers of the time were not powerful enough to do so smoothly. To implement parallax scrolling without having to manage all of the elements moving past each other, {{he came up with}} a plan to instead save combinations of overlapping foreground and background elements in memory and display the appropriate combination for where Keen was on the screen, so that the game only needed to pick the correct image rather than recalculate what that image would be.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII {{admitted}} the Count of Artois and his nephews the Dukes of Angoulême and Berry into the king's council in May 1814, upon its establishment. The council was informally headed by Prince Talleyrand. Louis XVIII took a large {{interest in the}} goings-on of the Congress of Vienna (set up <b>to</b> <b>redraw</b> the map of Europe after Napoleon's demise). Talleyrand represented France at the proceedings. Louis was horrified by Prussia's intention to annex the Kingdom of Saxony, {{to which he was}} attached because his mother was born a Saxon princess, and he was also concerned that Prussia would dominate Germany. He also wished the Duchy of Parma to be restored to the Parmese Bourbons, and not to Empress Marie Louise of France, as was being suggested by the Allies. Louis also protested the Allies' inaction in Naples, where he wanted the Napoleonic usurper Joachim Murat removed in favour of the Neapolitan Bourbons.|$|E

5|$|One of Tolkien's least-known short {{works is}} the children's storybook Mr. Bliss, {{published}} in 1982. It {{tells the story}} of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car. Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions. The story was inspired by Tolkien's own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in 1932. The bears were based on toy bears owned by Tolkien's sons. Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book. He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from him after the success of The Hobbit. The lavish ink and coloured-pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive. Tolkien agreed <b>to</b> <b>redraw</b> the pictures in a simpler style, but then found he did not have time to do so. The book was published in 1982 as a facsimile of Tolkien's difficult-to-read illustrated manuscript, with a typeset transcription on each facing page.|$|E
5|$|Sasuke {{was also}} the most {{difficult}} character for Kishimoto to draw. He felt that his drawings tended to make Sasuke look too old, {{a result of his}} inexperience in drawing younger characters mature beyond their years. Sasuke's hair, originally kept short to save Kishimoto time, slowly grew longer as the series has progressed. Midway through Part I, Kishimoto drew a new costume for Sasuke featuring a number of belts strapped around his arms and legs, but because it took too long to draw, he returned to Sasuke's original costume design. Despite the time and energy Kishimoto spends drawing Sasuke, he has become his favorite character to draw. He ranked Sasuke alongside Sakura in terms of drawing difficulty. In some cases, his superiors even asked Kishimoto <b>to</b> <b>redraw</b> parts of the manga that did not illustrate Sasuke well.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo DS {{version was}} {{directed}} by Hironori Ishigami and planned and supervised by Tomie, while Hiroyoshi Umetani was the main planner and in charge of game balance, Shin-ichiro Tomie created the scenario and events, Tanaka worked on the presentation and assisted with the scenario, and Masayasu Yamamoto programmed the dungeons. In addition to Sugiyama, the Nintendo DS version's music was worked on by Hayato Matsuo. The idea of developing a Nintendo DS version started when Chunsoft was considering creating a series of Mystery Dungeon games for the Nintendo DS. Previous Mystery Dungeon titles came up in conversation: they considered doing something with the Game Boy games, but decided against it {{as it would have}} required them <b>to</b> <b>redraw</b> all the art, leaving them to decide between working on the Super Famicom or the Nintendo 64 titles; they eventually settled on working on the Super Famicom title Shiren the Wanderer.|$|E
2500|$|Proposals for {{partitioning}} Punjab {{had been}} made starting from 1908. Its proponents included the Hindu leader Bhai Parmanand, Congress leader Lala Lajpat Rai, industrialist G. D. Birla, and various Sikh leaders. After the Lahore resolution (1940) of the Muslim League demanding Pakistan, B. R. Ambedkar wrote a 400-page tract titled Thoughts on Pakistan, wherein he discussed {{the boundaries of the}} Muslim and non-Muslim regions of Punjab and Bengal. His calculations showed a Muslim majority in 16 western districts of Punjab and non-Muslim majority in 13 eastern districts. In Bengal, he showed non-Muslim majority in 15 districts. He thought the Muslims could have no objection <b>to</b> <b>redrawing</b> provincial boundaries. If they did, they did not quite [...] "understand the nature of their own demand".|$|R

5|$|Bolstered by {{publicity}} stunts, Land of the Soviets was {{a commercial}} success in Belgium, and also witnessed serialisation in France and Switzerland. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Tintin in the Congo, and the series became a defining {{part of the}} Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Damage to the original plates prevented republication of the book for several decades, while Hergé later expressed embarrassment at the crudeness of the work. As he began <b>to</b> <b>redraw</b> his earlier Adventures in second, colour versions from 1942 onward, he decided against doing so for Land of the Soviets; {{it was the only}} completed Tintin story that Hergé did not reproduce in colour. Growing demand among fans of the series resulted in the production of unauthorised copies of the book in the 1960s, with the first officially sanctioned republication appearing in 1969, after which it was translated into several other languages, including English. Critical reception of the work has been largely negative, with commentators on The Adventures of Tintin describing it as one of Hergé's weakest works.|$|E

Hall, meanwhile, had received feedback from parents who did not like that the enemies in Vorticons left behind corpses instead of disappearing like in other games; he did not want the violence to have no effects, and so in Dreams replaced the raygun with pellets that temporarily stunned enemies. He was not satisfied with this change, and while considering ways to remove Keen's parents during the introduction for Galaxy, came up with a stun gun which would leave behind permanently stunned enemies, which appeared in all three episodes made in 1991. Additionally, music, which was missing in prior Keen games, was added to Aliens, composed by Bobby Prince.|$|E

2500|$|One of Unger's more {{promising}} engagements was the Latin American Alternative {{in the late}} 1990s. Unger and Mexican politician and political scientist Jorge Castañeda Gutman assembled an informal network of politicians and business leaders dedicated <b>to</b> <b>redrawing</b> the political map. The aim of the group {{was to provide a}} critique of neoliberalism coupled with a way forward in a distinct strategy and institutional model of development. They floated proposals such as guaranteeing every citizen [...] "social rights" [...] (e.g. education and a job), breaking up media oligopolies, and holding town meetings to help citizens supervise municipal spending. The group held a number of meetings over the years, which included Brazilian finance minister Ciro Gomes, Chilean senator Carlos Ominami, Argentinian politicians Dante Caputo and Rodolfo Terragno, and Mexican politician and future president Vicente Fox. The meetings resulted in a document entitled the [...] "Buenos Aires Consensus" [...] in 1997, which Castaneda called [...] "the end of neoliberalism; of the Washington Consensus".|$|R

50|$|With the {{completion}} of the long running French wars a new order was required in Europe and the heads of the European states gathered in Vienna for the prolonged discussion of Europe's future, although the Congress was actually convened in September 1814 prior to Napoleon's attempted return, and completed before the Battle of Waterloo. It was as much a grand social event of the representatives of the great powers as a true Congress and was chaired by Metternich. The resulting order was referred to as the Concert of Europe. It established a balance of power and spheres of influence. In addition <b>to</b> <b>redrawing</b> the political map it created a new entity out of the ashes of the Holy Roman Empire, the German Confederation. Achieving the presidency of this new entity was Austria's greatest gain from the Congress. What the Congress could not do was to recover the old order on which Austrian and Habsburg authority had rested.|$|R
