40|$|Lysozyme {{amyloidosis}} is a {{hereditary disease}} in which mutations in the gene coding for lysozyme leads to misfolding and consequently accumulation of amyloid material. To improve {{understanding of the}} processes involved we expressed human wild type (WT) lysozyme and the disease-associated variant F 57 I in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) of a Drosophila melanogaster model of lysozyme amyloidosis, with and without co-expression of serum amyloid p component (SAP). SAP is known to be a universal constituent of amyloid deposits and to associate with lysozyme fibrils. There are clear indications that SAP may {{play an important role in}} lysozyme amyloidosis, which requires further elucidation. We found that flies expressing the amyloidogenic variant F 57 I in the CNS have a shorter lifespan than flies expressing WT lysozyme. We also identified apoptotic cells in the brains of F 57 I flies demonstrating that the flies neurological functions are impaired when F 57 I is expressed in the nerve cells. However, co-expression of SAP in the CNS prevented cell death and restored the F 57 I flies lifespan. Thus, SAP has the apparent ability to protect nerve cells from damage caused by F 57 I. Furthermore, it was found that co-expression of SAP prevented accumulation of insoluble forms of lysozyme in both WT- and F 57 I-expressing flies. Our findings suggest that the F 57 I mutation affects the aggregation process of lysozyme resulting in the formation of cytotoxic species and that SAP is able to prevent cell death in the F 57 I flies by preventing accumulation of <b>toxic</b> <b>F</b> 57 I structures.

40|$|Introduction: Iranian {{scorpion}} {{species are}} classified in Buthidae and Scorpionidae with 16 genera and 25 species. In Iran, {{similar to other}} parts of the world, there are a few known species of scorpions responsible for severe envenoming. Mesobuthus eupeus is the most common species in Iran. Its venom contains several toxin fractions which can affect the ion channel. In this study purification, labeling and biological evaluation of Mesobuthus eupeus scorpion venom are described. Methods: To separate different venom fractions, soluble venom was loaded on a chromatography column packed with sephadex G 50 gel then the fractions were collected according to UV absorption at 280 nm wavelength. <b>Toxic</b> fraction (<b>F</b> 3) was loaded on anionic ion exchanger resin (DEAE) and then on a cationic resins (CM).

First, we examined the acute toxicity of Cd in F. paulensis at 24, 48, 72, and 96 -h lethal concentration (LC 50). Cd was significantly more toxic at 5 salinity than at 20 and 36. The oxygen consumption and ammonium excretion were estimated through experiments performed on each of the twelve possible combinations of three salinities (36, 20 and 5), at temperature 20 °C. Cd showed a reduction in oxygen consumption at 5 salinity, the results show that the oxygen consumption decreases with respect to the Cd concentration. At the highest Cd concentration employed (2 mgL− 1), the salinity 5 and the temperature at 20 °C, oxygen consumption decreases 53. 7 % in relation to the control.

Postdivisional elongation of the filament appears to involve a "slide-by" process whereby sibling cells slide by each other along their opposed valve faces and then stop, becoming fused by their overlapping tips. The raphe is probably involved in this, as well as in filament and cell motility.

Methods: Blood samples and liver of 63 indigenous sheep of Pramenka breed, slaughtered in the period from March to December 2009 were used. Based on parasitological findings in the liver, all animals were divided into two groups: control (n= 34) and infected group (n= 29). For investigation and description of pathological changes in sheep liver, naturally infected with F. hepatica, corrosion cast technique was used. Results: Biochemical analysis of tested parameters showed a significant elevation (P≤ 0. 05) of serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), total bilirubin (TBIL) and direct bilirubin (DBIL) in infected sheep group comparing with the control group. No significant differences were observed for activity of aspartate aminotranferase (AST) between groups. Vascular and biliary systems of the liver were found to be affected.

Place and Duration of Study: Sample: Studies were conducted at three floors (as indoor sampling sites) of the National Library and Archives of Dar El-Kottob, Egypt during one year, between November 2012 to October 2013. Methodology: By using the Food Poisoned Technique 11 metallic ion, 5 fungicides and 5 essential oils were used to investigate their effective against the two selected fungal isolates Fusarium oxysporum and Trichoderma viride to evaluate these protective agents by measuring their effect on fungal mycelial (linear) growth and cellulolytic activity. Results: The results revealed that of 11 metallic ions tested only metallic ions of CoCl 2, FeSO 4, NiCl 2, CuSo 4 and ZnSO 4 at 100 mM were completely inhibited the linear growth of F. oxysporum, while the same concentration of CoCl 2, FeSO 4, FeCl 3 and NiCl 2 also completely inhibit the growth of T. viride. For cellulases activity, all metallic ions at different concentrations inhibit the activity, except CoCl 2, which increased the avicelase enzyme activity of F. oxysporum.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of the present thesis was to study some harmful algal species which cause blooms in Italian coastal waters, leading to {{consequences}} for human health, coastal ecosystem, fishery and tourism. In particular, {{in the first part}} of this thesis the toxicity of Adriatic strains of the raphidophyte Fibrocapsa japonica was investigated. Despite several hypotheses have been proposed for the toxic mechanism of the raphidophytes, especially for the species Chattonella antiqua and C. marina, which have been studied more extensively, just a few studies on the toxic effects of these species for different organisms were reported. Moreover, a careful reading of the literature evidenced as any ichthyotoxic events reported worldwide can be linked to F. japonica blooms. Although recently several studies were performed on F. japonica strains from the USA, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Germany, and France in order to characterize their growth and toxicity features, the work reported in this thesis results one of the first investigation on the <b>toxic</b> effects of <b>F.</b> japonica for different organisms, such as bacteria, crustaceans and fish. Mortality effects, together with haemolysis of fish erythrocytes, probably due to the relatively high amount of PUFAs produced by this species, were observed. Mortality for fish, however, was reported only at a high cell density and after a long exposition period (9 - 10 days); moreover a significant increase of H 2 O 2 obtained in the tanks where sea basses were exposed to F. japonica was also relevant. This result may justify the absence of ichthyotoxic events in the Italian coasts, despite F. japonica blooms detected in these areas were characterized by high cell densities. This work reports also a first complete characterization of the fatty acids produced and extracellularly released by the Adriatic F. japonica, and results were also compared with the fatty acid profile of other strains. The absence of known brevetoxins in F. japonica algal extracts was also highlighted, leading to the hypothesis that the toxicity of F. japonica may be due to a synergic effect of PUFAs and ROS. Another microalgae that was studied in this thesis is the benthic dinoflagellate Ostreopsis cf. ovata. This species was investigated with the aim to investigate the effect of environmental parameters on its growth and toxicity. O. cf. ovata, in fact, shows different blooming periods along the Italian coasts and even the reported toxic effects are variable. The results of this work confirmed the high variability in the growth dynamic and toxin content of several Italian strains which were isolated in recent years along the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian Seas. Moreover, the effects of temperature and salinity on the behaviour of the different isolates are in good agreement with the results obtained from field surveys, which evidence as the environmental parameters are important factors modulating O. cf. ovata proliferation. Another relevant result that was highlighted is the anomaly in the production of palytoxin-like compounds reported by one of the studied isolate, in particular the one isolated in 2008 in Ancona (Adriatic Sea). Only this strain reported the absence of two (ovatoxin-b and –c) of the five ovatoxins so far known in the toxin profile and a different relative abundance of the other toxins. The last aspect that was studied in this thesis regards the toxin biosythesis. In fact, toxins produced (palytoxin-like compounds) or supposed to be produced (brevetoxin-like compounds) by O. cf. ovata and F. japonica, respectively, are polyketides, which are highly oxygenated compounds synthesized by complex enzymes known as polyketide synthase (PKS) enzymes. These enzymes are multi-domain complexes that structurally and functionally resemble the fatty acid synthases (FASs). This work reports the first study of PKS proteins in the dinoflagellates O. cf. ovata, C. monotis and in the raphidophyte F. japonica. For the first time some PKSs were identified in these species, confirming the presence of PKS proteins predicted by the in silico translation of the transcripts found in K. brevis also in other species. The identification of O. cf. ovata PKSs and the localization of the palytoxin-like compounds produced by this dinoflagellate in a similar location (chloroplast) as that observed for other dinoflagellate and cyanobacterial toxins provides some indication that these proteins may be involved in polyketide biosynthesis. However, their potential function as fatty acid synthases cannot be ruled out, as plant fatty acid synthesis also occurs within chloroplasts. This last hypothesis is also supported by the fact that in all the investigated species, and in particular in F. japonica, PKS proteins were present. Therefore, these results provide an important contribution to the study of the polyketides and of the involvement of PKS proteins in the toxin biosynthesis. ...|$|R

These sequences flank the centromeres and can present a target measured in megabases. In this protocol a biotin or digoxigenin labelled DNA probe is detected using HRP-conjugated antibodies. The signal is visualised with diaminobenzidine (DAB). Normal, healthy nuclei show two spots. Aneusomic nuclei show 1, 3, 4 or more spots. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. A 6 mm section of a paraffin embedded raft culture hybridised to a chromosome 17 specific alpha satellite probe. We buy our probes from Appligene/Oncor although they are very expensive and the telesales staff are rude. ### Starting material We have two types of starting material; (i) tissue culture cells attached to glass slides, (ii) sections taken from paraffin embedded tissue. 1. Tissue culture cells. We use multispot slides with 4 wells separated by PTFE coating. The slides are treated with APES prior to use (see below). The cells are trypsinised and resuspended as usual then one or two drops are placed onto the end well of a labelled slide. The cells are allowed to attach overnight in a humid chamber in the CO 2 incubator. Next day the slides are immersed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin. After 2 days fixation the slides are rinsed in H 2 O and allowed to air dry. Store dry, dust-free. - Paraffin sections. Take 6 mm sections onto APES treated slides (see below) and bake overnight at 60 C. Dewax in Xylene, 2 x 5 minutes. Then immerse as follows; 100 % ethanol 2 x 5 minutes, 90 % Ethanol 5 minutes, 75 % ethanol 5 minutes, H 2 O 2 x 5 minutes and allow to dry. Store dry, dust-free. ### Typical Protocol 1. Immerse the slides in 1 M sodium thiocyanate at 80 C for 10 minutes. Rinse in H 2 O and allow to dry. - *This treatment strips away the histones*. - *If using cheap glass coplin jars, allow to heat up slowly with the water bath, otherwise they crack*. - Treat the slides with 4 mg/ml pepsin at 37 C for 30 minutes. Rinse in H 2 O, 2 x 5 minutes, and allow to dry. - *This opens up the fixed (crosslinked) cytoplasm to allow probe access. Make up 0. 2 M HCl [50 mls H 2 O + 800 ml conc. HCl], weigh out a little pepsin (Sigma P 7012) into a universal and add the 0. 2 M HCl to make 4 mg/ml. Place the slides flat in a humid chamber (eg a large square plastic petri dish) and drop the pepsin gently onto the slide. Then place in the 37 C incubator*. - *This pepsin digestion is the most crucial step. Too little digestion and the probe {{will not be able}} to access the chromosomes. Too much and the morphology will all be chewed up*. - Prepare the hybridisation solution. - *One well of a multispot slide needs 6 ml of hyb with a 13 mm circular coverslip*. - *A square 22 mm coverslip uses 10 - 12 ml*. - *For larger than this you can put two slides face to face (acting as each other's coverslip) with 30 ml of hyb solution*. ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") 4. Apply an appropriate amount of hybridisation solution onto the slide and cover with a coverslip. 5. Incubate at 80 C for 10 minutes. This denatures the DNA 6. Transfer to a humid chamber and incubate overnight at 37 C 7. Dip the slides into a coplin jar containing wash solution, allow the coverslips to slide off. Immerse the slides in formamide wash solution for 20 minutes at 42 C. - *We wash in formamide wash solution at 42 C. The wash can be done without formamide at higher temperature (try 0. 25 x SSC at 72 C for 5 minutes) Formamide wash solution: 60 ml formamide <b>TOXIC</b> (Sigma <b>F</b> 7503), 30 ml H 2 O, 10 ml 20 x SSC, 80 ml conc. HCl (to bring the pH to 7) * - *Do not allow the slides to dry at any stage until after DAB detection*. 8. Immerse briefly in PBS to wash, then incubate with blocking solution for 20 minutes at room temperature. - *Lay the slides flat in a humid chamber and drop the solution onto them* - *Do not allow the slides to dry* - *Blocking solution: 100 ml PBS, 2 g BSA (Sigma A 3059), 50 ml Tween 20 *. - *I carefully dry around the tissue (or round the edge of the slide if I cannot see the tissue) with a paper towel to define a wet area for the various washes*. 9. Drain off the blocking solution and replace with mouse anti-biotin antibody diluted 1 : 100 in blocking solution for 40 minutes at 37 C. - *We currently use DAKO antibody #M 0743, 100 - 200 ml per slide*. 10. Wash with blocking solution for 10 minutes 11. Incubate with rabbit anti-mouse HRP antibody diluted 1 : 80 for 40 minutes at 37 C - We use DAKO P 0260 12. Wash with blocking solution for 10 minutes 13. Incubate with swine anti-rabbit HRP antibody diluted 1 : 100 for 40 minutes at 37 C - *We use DAKO P 0217 * 14. Wash in PBS for 5 minutes 15. Detect the signal using Diaminobenzidine (DAB) - *I use DAB tablets (Sigma D 4293) to make 5 ml of DAB solution and then carefuuly drop the DAB onto the slides. DAB is carcinogenic so take care. The signal takes about 10 minutes to develop. If you're lucky you may be able to see tiny spots at low power under the microscope (take care not to dip the lens in the DAB solution) * - *Follow these URLs to learn about safe disposal of DAB:* [[URL] [[URL] 16. Rinse in tap water, stain the nuclei using haematoxylin, de-hydrate through the ethanol series and mount in DPX. - *The length of the haematoxylin stain depends on the kind of haemaotoxylin and how much it has been used. Try 30 secs at first. Check under the low power microscope*. **APES treatment of slides** *This is an alternative to poly-L-lysine treatment. The APES coating makes the slides more adhesive for fixed tissue and living cells*. Fill several big metal slide racks with slides (I do hundreds at a time), then treat each rack sequentially as follows; 1. Immerse in 1 % acid/alcohol 30 mins - *Acid alcohol is [1 % (v/v) concentrated HCl, 70 % Ethanol, 29 % H 2 O]* - *This is to clean the slides* - Rinse in water and allow to dry - *First rinse in running tap water, then immerse in distilled water, then allow to dry*. - Immerse in acetone for 10 minutes - Immerse in [2 %(v/v) APES in acetone] for 5 minutes. - *APES is aminopropyltriethoxysilane (Sigma A 3648) * - Immerse briefly in 2 sequential rinses of distilled H 2 O - Allow to dry and store in a dust-free container - *Use within months not years...|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} major regulatory mechanisms for wolf spider populations. Field and laboratory experiments focussed on the importance of prey availability (autochthonous & allochthonous), food quality and habitat heterogeneity on performance of individual wolf spiders or whole populations and on intra- (cannibalism) and interspecific (intraguild predation) relationships in wolf spiders. Wolf spider populations on xeric grasslands near Darmstadt (Germany) are increased on grazed sites as compared to sites without sheep grazing. Since potential prey was also more abundant on grazed sites, I hypothesised that spiders were bottom-up controlled. Therefore, alternative prey (Drosophila melanogaster; Diptera) was added to fenced plots on grazed and non-grazed sites in the field and spider as well as prey densities (detritivores & herbivores) were compared to plots without prey addition. In order to document integration of D. melanogaster into the arthropod food web, stable isotopes in the most abundant animals were analysed. Even though D. melanogaster was integrated into the diet of most predators as documented by stable isotope analysis, neither spiders nor ground beetles increased in densities when provided with additional alternative prey. Similarly, densities of potential prey, such as Collembola and Auchenorrhyncha, were not affected by prey addition, indicating that prey populations were not effectively controlled by predator populations. Stable isotope analysis documented the dependence of Lycosidae and Carabidae on prey from the detritivore food. Collembola were strongly increased on grazed sites, presumably being responsible for increased wolf spider densities indicating that wolf spider populations were bottom-up controlled. Probably, the amount of alternative prey added was not sufficient to significantly affect predator and prey densities in addition to the beneficial effect of grazing. The importance of allochthonous resources in food webs has been documented and spider populations are often sustained by prey from the detritivore food web (see above). In coastal ecosystems, predators often benefit from allochthonous input from the marine ecosystem. Kelp and sea grass deposition is common on sandy beaches on the east coast of Tasmania (Australia) providing marine input for cursorial predators on the beach and foredunes. I hypothesised that the terrestrial predators benefit from these allochthonous resources. Animals from the beach and the foredune were collected and most abundant taxa were selected for stable isotope analysis in order to trace the importance of marine subsidies in animal diet. This is possible, because stable isotope ratios in algae differ strongly from those in terrestrial plants that determine the baseline of the terrestrial food web. According to activity abundance of animals, arthropods could be separated into the beach and the foredune community that hardly overlapped. Stable isotope analysis documented that kelp deposits were used by amphipods and isopods that were the most abundant animals on the beach. Despite of their high abundance, only few predators, such as Tetralycosa oraria (Lycosidae), Cafius 2 (Staphylinidae) and Tuoba laticeps (Geophilomorpha) preyed on these isopods and amphipods. Stable isotope analyses revealed feeding niches of predators and documented that the marine subsidies were not incorporated into the foredune food web. Thus, the availability of allochthonous resources is not necessarily important for arthropod food webs in the vicinity of ecosystem borders. However, some predators specialize on prey depending on marine allochthonous resources. Dietary mixing and food quality have become major issues in foraging theory. Both prey availability and prey quality play an important role in growth and reproduction of generalist predators. In general, food mixing is beneficial for predators, since it may optimise nutrient uptake and dilute toxins. The springtail Folsomia candida has been used in many laboratory experiments and was proven toxic for various predators. In contrast, Drosophila melanogaster and Heteromurus nitidus (Collembola) are considered to be intermediate to high quality prey. Performance and reproduction of female Pardosa lugubris (Lycosidae) fed with prey of different quality were investigated. Spiders were fed either a single diet of D. melanogaster, H. nitidus or F. candida, or a mixed diet of D. melanogaster and H. nitidus, or of D. melanogaster and F. candida. Feeding on high quality prey (D. melanogaster only, H. nitidus only and both combined) resulted in similar growth and reproduction of female P. lugubris as well as in similar offspring number, size and survival. There was no positive effect of mixing high quality prey. In contrast, feeding on <b>toxic</b> prey (<b>F.</b> candida) in single and mixed diet was detrimental and none of the females survived. P. lugubris did not develop acquired aversion against F. candida and offering high quality prey (D. melanogaster) mixed with F. candida did not improve survival. Nutrient flow from females into offspring during egg production was investigated using stable isotope analysis. D. melanogaster was enriched in 13 C and this allowed tracing the carbon flow from prey into females and into their offspring. Furthermore, both D. melanogaster and H. nitidus were enriched in 15 N compared to female spiders so that nitrogen flow from prey into offspring could be followed. The enrichment in 13 C and 15 N differed strongly between juveniles and their mothers. The analyses suggest that adult females invested dietary nutrients almost exclusively into egg production. Mortality of juvenile Pardosa palustris (Lycosidae) is high on xeric grasslands near Darmstadt likely resulting from predation by conspecifics (cannibalism) or other predators (intraguild predation). Cannibalism is common among spiders and likely is a major mortality factor for juvenile wolf spiders in the field. Potential driving factors for intraspecific predation in P. palustris were investigated conducting two laboratory experiments to evaluate the role of availability of alternative prey, habitat structure and spider density for cannibalism between and within developmental stages. Availability of alternative insect prey strongly reduced cannibalism between adult spiders and juveniles as well as among juveniles. For juvenile spiders habitat complexity reduced predation by adult females, whereas cannibalism among second instar spiderlings was not affected by habitat structure suggesting that complex habitat structure only provides shelter from cannibalism by large conspecifics. High density of juvenile spiders increased cannibalism only when alternative prey was available, suggesting that alternative prey increased aggression and interference at higher density. High mortality and low growth of spiders in treatments without alternative prey likely resulted from starvation indicating that intraspecific prey is of low food quality and does not allow spider development. Intraguild predation is also common among generalist predators and an important issue for food web theory. Juveniles of Alopecosa cuneata (Lycosidae) are likely to be successful intraguild predators of the smaller P. palustris, adding to juvenile mortality on xeric grasslands near Darmstadt. Intraguild predation of third instar A. cuneata on second instar P. palustris was investigated in a laboratory experiment manipulating availability of alternative prey and microhabitat complexity. Both, the presence of alternative prey and complex microhabitat structure reduced mortality of juvenile P. palustris during the first week. During the second week, mortality increased in complex structure without alternative prey presumably due to enhanced activity of starving P. palustris and cannibalism among second instar juveniles. Stable isotope analysis documented predation of A. cuneata on P. palustris and predation on alternative prey by both juveniles. Thus, using stable isotope analysis intraguild predation among arthropod predators was documented for the first time under semi-natural conditions in the laboratory. In conclusion, intraguild predation can be an important mortality factor for juvenile wolf spiders in the field, if resources are limited and shelter by a complex structured microhabitat is missing. Since shelter is abundant on xeric grasslands near Darmstadt, intraguild predation by A. cuneata can be excluded as an important mortality factor for juvenile P. palustris in the field suggesting that rather cannibalism and/or intraguild predation by other spider species of similar size cause substantial mortality in P. palustris. Results {{of this study}} document the importance of prey availability, food quality and habitat heterogeneity for wolf spider populations. Cannibalism and intraguild predation among wolf spiders depended on the availability of alternative prey and microhabitat structure and may be major factors regulating spider populations. When juveniles hatch in close proximity, cannibalism and intraguild predation can contribute to population regulation by imposing greater per capita mortality at high densities. Furthermore, cannibalism and intraguild predation increase population synchrony by exerting size-specific mortality on smaller individuals throughout development...|$|R
