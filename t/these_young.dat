Even though the members of Bonded by Blood were not born when their favorite 1980s thrash metal bands released their debut albums, the music and fashion of that era {{had a profound impact on}} them.|$|E
5|$|I went to Iraq {{because what}} I saw when I {{was over there}} was soldiers—young kids for the most part—helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get {{hospitals}} open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice. It's like spitting on <b>these</b> <b>young</b> {{men and women who}} are over there fighting to help this country.|$|E
5|$|Koalas {{typically}} inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and {{the leaves}} of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers' pouches, where they stay {{for the first six}} to seven months of their lives. <b>These</b> <b>young</b> koalas, known as joeys, are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala retrovirus, as well as by bushfires and droughts.|$|E

5|$|Such {{treatment}} of the Christians for refusals by the girls is also confirmed in the accounts of British officer James Scurry, who was held captive along with the Mangalorean Catholics. In his book The Captivity, Sufferings, and Escape of James Scurry, who was Detained a Prisoner During Ten Years, in the Dominions of Hyder Ali and Tippoo Saib (1824), Scurry also reports that Tipu relented on his demand for captive girls, after one captive fell from her beast and expired on the spot through loss of blood. About 200 young women, the prettiest and fairest, were selected for Tipu's seraglio. The rest {{of the women were}} distributed as wives to Muslim officers and favourites living there. The future Christian progeny of <b>these</b> <b>young</b> girls and women were lost, and their descendants are fully Islamic as of today.|$|E
5|$|Other, {{more recent}} {{studies suggest that}} the idea of object {{permanence}} may not be an innate function of young children. While, in reference to Piaget's theory, it has been established that young children develop object permanence as they age, the question arises: does this occur because of a particular perception that already existed within the minds of <b>these</b> <b>young</b> children? Is object permanence really an inbred response to the neural pathways developing in young minds? Studies suggest that a multitude of variables may be responsible for the development of object permanence rather than a natural talent of infants. Evidence suggests that infants use a variety of cues while studying an object and their perception of the object's permanence can be tested without physically hiding the object. Rather, the object is occluded, slightly obstructed, from the infants view and they are left only other visual cues, such as examining the object from different trajectories. It was also found that the longer an infant focuses on an object may be due to detected discontinuities in their visual field, or the flow of events, with which the infant has become familiar.|$|E

25|$|Nichollas Walter in {{his study}} of youth {{immigrants}} reveal that the young immigrants constantly encounters the duality of exclusion and inclusion in their life. They often define themselves as Americans because their philosophies and mindsets are no different from other contemporary Americans. However, at the same time, they feel excluded in real life because they cannot easily debunk their undocumented immigrant status. This experience often hampers a stable formation of identity among <b>these</b> <b>young</b> second-generations. Consequently, due to their discouraging youth period, <b>these</b> <b>young</b> immigrants are often discouraged to participate in the politics even after they gained appropriate legal status for residency in the United States. Recently, there have been #DREAMers online movements on different social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. In fact, social media has become a key tool for the younger immigrant population in their process of assimilating into the U.S. society. By publicly sharing their narratives as undocumented immigrants, <b>these</b> <b>young</b> immigrants could successfully increase their political representation and solidify a sense of personal identity.|$|E
