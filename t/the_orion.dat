5|$|In September 2011, NASA {{announced}} {{the start of}} the Space Launch System program to develop a human-rated heavy lift vehicle. The Space Launch System is intended to launch <b>the</b> <b>Orion</b> Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle and other elements towards the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, and one day Mars. <b>The</b> <b>Orion</b> MPCV conducted an unmanned test launch on a Delta IV Heavy rocket in December 2014.|$|E
5|$|Earth, {{along with}} the Solar System, is {{situated}} in the Milky Way and orbits about 28,000light-years from its center. It is about 20light-years above the galactic plane in <b>the</b> <b>Orion</b> Arm.|$|E
5|$|On June 8, 2013, at <b>the</b> <b>Orion</b> Festival, {{billed as}} the fictional band Dehaan, Metallica played the album in its {{entirety}} {{for the first time}} ever to mark the 30 year anniversary of the album.|$|E
50|$|Kaneda {{worked as}} a {{commentator}} before being called upon to manage <b>the</b> Lotte <b>Orions</b> (currently known as the Chiba Lotte Marines) from 1973 to 1978, and again from 1990 to 1991. <b>The</b> <b>Orions</b> won <b>the</b> Japan Series championship in 1974, with Kaneda's younger brother, Tomehiro, pitching for <b>the</b> <b>Orions</b> and winning <b>the</b> MVP award. <b>The</b> <b>Orions</b> used uniforms designed by Kaneda for 19 seasons.|$|R
50|$|In 1958, {{the team}} was merged with the Daiei Unions and renamed <b>the</b> Daimai <b>Orions.</b> In 1964 they became <b>the</b> Tokyo <b>Orions,</b> and <b>the</b> Lotte <b>Orions</b> in 1969. <b>The</b> {{franchise}} was slow to duplicate its initial success: <b>the</b> <b>Orions</b> made <b>the</b> Japan Series in 1960 and 1970, only to lose both years.|$|R
25|$|On 14 May 2007 BAE Systems Australia {{was awarded}} an $76.1 million {{contract}} {{to provide an}} upgraded electronic support measures (ESM) system for <b>the</b> <b>Orions.</b> <b>The</b> contract involved replacing existing sub-systems and ground support systems from 2011.|$|R
5|$|The Orions {{are placed}} under {{guard in the}} {{decontamination}} chamber. Harrad-Sar returns in his vessel and attacks the now disabled Enterprise, and then begins to tow it away. He reveals that, in fact, the Syndicate seeks Archer's head, and in this matter he is the slave and <b>the</b> <b>Orion</b> women are his masters. The Orions escape and travel to the Bridge, as do T'Pol and Tucker. Navaar tells Archer to arrest T'Pol, but Tucker stuns all the male crew-members with his phaser, and T'Pol disables <b>the</b> <b>Orion</b> ship with a pulse sent from Enterprise deflector dish. They send the Orions back to their ship, and T'Pol finally admits she would personally like Tucker to return, and he replies that he has already requested a transfer back to Enterprise.|$|E
5|$|The {{most likely}} star-formation {{scenario}} for Betelgeuse {{is that it}} is a runaway star from <b>the</b> <b>Orion</b> OB1 Association. Originally a member of a high-mass multiple system within Ori OB1a, Betelgeuse was probably formed about 10–12 million years ago, but has evolved rapidly due to its high mass.|$|E
5|$|Cicero {{translated}} Aratus in his youth; he made <b>the</b> <b>Orion</b> episode {{half again}} {{longer than it}} was in the Greek, adding the traditional Latin topos of madness to Aratus's text. Cicero's Aratea is one of the oldest Latin poems to come down to us as more than isolated lines; this episode may have established the technique of including epyllia in non-epic poems.|$|E
2500|$|The 333 Squadron {{operates}} six Lockheed P-3N Orion anti-submarine and [...] {{maritime patrol}} aircraft. During peacetime their main role is intelligence and surveillance through {{a range of}} data sensing equipment. The major advantage of <b>the</b> <b>Orions</b> {{is that they can}} cover a very large area; some missions allow it to monitor [...] During wartime they would be used for anti-submarine warfare and intelligence. <b>The</b> <b>Orions</b> have a range of [...] and are based at Andøya Air Station.|$|R
25|$|The AP-3Cs' new {{radar and}} {{electronic}} surveillance system greatly increased {{the capabilities of}} <b>the</b> RAAF's <b>Orion</b> fleet. These new systems allow <b>the</b> <b>Orions</b> to detect and identify more targets and at longer range. In 2002 the then-Chief of Air Force Air Vice Marshal Angus Houston claimed that the AP-3Cs were the best maritime patrol aircraft {{in the world and}} The Australian reported that they were superior to the United States Navy's Orions, though an upgrade was planned for <b>the</b> USN's <b>Orion</b> fleet.|$|R
5000|$|Furbl: Furry {{absent-minded}} brachiating mammals {{known for}} their agility. Once thought of as clever pets by <b>the</b> <b>Orions,</b> they were freed and given race status when they were discovered to be sapient by the Alliance. They are usually found serving in a technical or skilled manual trade like mechanic or cook, as <b>the</b> <b>Orions</b> traditionally used to use them for household servants. Furbls like to steal objects or pick the pockets of a friend or co-worker {{as part of a}} ritual game they picked up from watching and studying <b>the</b> <b>Orions.</b> This is not done for gain but for fun or sport. If the item is returned after their mark discovers that it is missing, the Furbl scores a point. If the mark prevents the theft or catches the Furbl in the act, the mark scores a point.|$|R
5|$|Other discoveries {{made with}} Hubble data include proto-planetary disks (proplyds) in <b>the</b> <b>Orion</b> Nebula; {{evidence}} {{for the presence of}} extrasolar planets around Sun-like stars; and the optical counterparts of the still-mysterious gamma ray bursts. HST has also been used to study objects in the outer reaches of the Solar System, including the dwarf planets Pluto and Eris.|$|E
5|$|Panggilan Darah debuted at <b>the</b> <b>Orion</b> Theatre in Batavia on 30 June 1941. It was {{reported}} as a modest success, making {{most of its}} money from lower class audiences. It was screened in Surabaya, East Java, by August, and by September it had been shown in Singapore, then part of British Malaya. A novelisation by Roestam Sutan Palindih was published by the Yogyakarta-based Kolff-Buning Publishers that year.|$|E
5|$|Since that time, most US space {{exploration}} {{efforts have been}} led by NASA, including the Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle. Currently, NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of <b>the</b> <b>Orion</b> Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, the Space Launch System and Commercial Crew vehicles. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program (LSP) which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for unmanned NASA launches.|$|E
50|$|Long {{before the}} time in which the game is set, two {{extremely}} powerful races, <b>the</b> <b>Orions</b> and <b>the</b> Antarans, fought a war that devastated most of the galaxy. <b>The</b> victorious <b>Orions,</b> rather than exterminate the Antarans, imprisoned them in a pocket dimension before departing the galaxy, leaving behind a very powerful robotic warship, the Guardian, to protect their homeworld.|$|R
50|$|In April 2017 it was {{revealed}} that the New Zealand Government is considering buying four Boeing P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft from the United States to replace <b>the</b> <b>Orions.</b>|$|R

5|$|Stars {{condense}} from {{regions of}} space of higher matter density, yet those regions are less dense than within a vacuum chamber. These regions – known as molecular clouds – consist mostly of hydrogen, with about 23 to 28 percent helium {{and a few}} percent heavier elements. One {{example of such a}} star-forming region is <b>the</b> <b>Orion</b> Nebula. Most stars form in groups of dozens to hundreds of thousands of stars.|$|E
5|$|Though {{initially}} {{slated for}} a July 1941 release, Tjioeng Wanara ultimately premiered at <b>the</b> <b>Orion</b> Theatre in Batavia (now Jakarta) on 18 August 1941. It was publicised extensively, often emphasising {{the role of}} Poerbatjaraka and using the name of Balai Pustaka, the official publishing house of the Dutch East Indies government known for its printed versions of traditional tales, in advertisements. The film was rated for all ages.|$|E
5|$|Charles Messier {{measured}} {{the position of}} the cluster and included it as M45 in his catalogue of comet-like objects, published in 1771. Along with <b>the</b> <b>Orion</b> Nebula and the Praesepe cluster, Messier's inclusion of the Pleiades has been noted as curious, as most of Messier's objects were much fainter and more easily confused with comets—something that seems scarcely possible for the Pleiades. One possibility is that Messier simply wanted to have a larger catalogue than his scientific rival Lacaille, whose 1755 catalogue contained 42 objects, and so he added some bright, well-known objects to boost his list.|$|E
50|$|Kaoru Betto (born August 23, 1920 in Nishinomiya, Hyōgo) was a Nippon Professional Baseball player. After {{playing for}} the Ōsaka Tigers for two years, Betto played for <b>the</b> Mainichi <b>Orions</b> from 1950 to 1957. In his first season with <b>the</b> <b>Orions,</b> Betto won <b>the</b> NPB's first Pacific League MVP Award and helped lead the team to victory in the first Japan Series.|$|R
500|$|The King George V {{class was}} {{equipped}} with ten 45-calibre breech-loading (BL) 13.5-inch Mark V gun in five hydraulically powered, centreline, twin-gun turrets, designated 'A', 'B', 'Q', 'X' and 'Y' from front to rear. The guns had a maximum elevation of +20° which gave them a range of [...] Their gunsights, however, were limited to +15° until super-elevating prisms were installed by 1916 to allow full elevation. In contrast to <b>the</b> <b>Orions,</b> <b>the</b> loading machinery of these turrets was modified to accommodate longer and heavier [...] projectiles, some [...] more than those of <b>the</b> <b>Orions,</b> at a muzzle velocity of about [...] {{at a rate of}} two rounds per minute. The ships carried 100 shells per gun.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, it was {{announced}} that NAS Valkenburg would close in 2006. All <b>the</b> <b>Orions</b> were sold to the German (8) and Portuguese (5) Navies. Naval squadrons 320 and 321 were disbanded.|$|R
5|$|Enterprise is {{en route}} to the Berengarius system, one of the {{proposed}} locations for a Starfleet starbase, when it is approached by an Orion Syndicate vessel. Captain Archer is invited to visit <b>the</b> <b>Orion</b> ship by its captain, Harrad-Sar. During the visit, Archer and Lieutenant Reed are entertained by three Orion dancers, Navaar, D'Nesh, and Maras. Archer negotiates with Harrad-Sar and they agree to a joint magnesite mining operation, and the three slaves are given to him. They return to Enterprise with the slaves and set a course to survey the planet.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way is a barred {{spiral galaxy}} with a {{diameter}} between 100,000 and 180,000 light-years. The Milky Way is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars. There are probably at least 100 billion planets in the Milky Way. The Solar System is located within the disk, about 26,000 light-years from the Galactic Center, on the inner edge {{of one of the}} spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust called <b>the</b> <b>Orion</b> Arm. The stars in the inner ≈10,000 light-years form a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge. The very center is marked by an intense radio source, named Sagittarius A*, which {{is likely to be a}} supermassive black hole.|$|E
5|$|The {{links to}} The Original Series {{were seen as}} {{positive}} improvements to Star Trek: Enterprise by critics including elements such as {{the appearance of the}} Mirror Universe and <b>the</b> <b>Orion</b> slave girls. Other story arcs praised included the Augment arc with Brent Spiner and the return of the genetic supermen made famous by Ricardo Montalbán's Khan in The Original Series. Phillip Chung of AsianWeek bemoaned the loss of the show, because he felt that it had improved over time and due to the franchise's continued progressive stance in showing racial minorities outside of the normal stereotypes.|$|E
50|$|The King George V {{class was}} {{equipped}} with ten 45-calibre breech-loading (BL) 13.5-inch Mark V gun in five hydraulically powered, centreline, twin-gun turrets, designated 'A', 'B', 'Q', 'X' and 'Y' from front to rear. The guns had a maximum elevation of +20° which gave them a range of 23830 yd. Their gunsights, however, were limited to +15° until super-elevating prisms were installed by 1916 to allow full elevation. In contrast to <b>the</b> <b>Orions,</b> <b>the</b> loading machinery of these turrets was modified to accommodate longer and heavier 1400 lb projectiles, some 150 lb more than those of <b>the</b> <b>Orions,</b> at a muzzle velocity of about 2500 ft/s {{at a rate of}} two rounds per minute. The ships carried 100 shells per gun.|$|R
25|$|Leron Lee {{played for}} <b>the</b> Lotte <b>Orions</b> from 1977–1987. He {{led the league}} in home runs and runs batted in his first season, and won the batting title in 1980. In 1978, he invited younger brother Leon Lee to play in Japan, and the {{brothers}} formed a feared power-hitting duo for <b>the</b> <b>Orions.</b> <b>The</b> African American sidekick role in the 1992 film Mr. Baseball (played by actor Dennis Haysbert) is believed {{to be based on the}} experiences of several African American players in Japan, including the Lee brothers.|$|R
50|$|In 1958, the Unions {{merged with}} <b>the</b> Mainichi <b>Orions</b> to form <b>the</b> Daimai <b>Orions.</b> This enabled <b>the</b> Pacific League to shrink from the ungainly seven-team {{arrangement}} (caused by the 1957 merger) to six teams.|$|R
5|$|The solar wind, {{a stream}} of charged {{particles}} flowing outwards from the Sun, creates a bubble-like region in the interstellar medium known as the heliosphere. The heliopause is {{the point at which}} pressure from the solar wind is equal to the opposing pressure of the interstellar medium; it extends out {{to the edge of the}} scattered disc. The Oort cloud, which is thought to be the source for long-period comets, may also exist at a distance roughly a thousand times further than the heliosphere. The Solar System is located in <b>the</b> <b>Orion</b> Arm, 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|The {{story was}} {{developed}} from Weinstein {{out of a}} Star Trek-based short story he had previously published in a school science fiction publication. After it failed to be read on the first submission, it was resubmitted and purchased by the production team. The episode featured the first appearance of male members of <b>the</b> <b>Orion</b> species in the Star Trek franchise; male Orions would not appear in a live action episode until 2004. Critical reception to the episode was mixed, {{and it has been}} released in several forms of home media, including VHS, LaserDisc and DVD.|$|E
5|$|Tjo and Tjan hired Njoo Cheong Seng, a dramatist who had {{previously}} worked with <b>the</b> <b>Orion</b> Opera before establishing his own troupe, and his wife Fifi Young. The two had gained wide recognition through their stage work, and {{it was hoped that}} name recognition would bring in audiences. The hiring of Njoo and Young was part of a trend of bringing theatrically trained actors and crew into the film industry. Terang Boelan had used stage starlet Roekiah and her husband Kartolo to great effect, and the actors had brought similar financial success to Tan's Film after they were hired.|$|E
5000|$|Master of Orion II: Battle at Antares (1996), {{computer-based}} strategy game {{designed by}} Steve Barcia and Ken Burd. A conflict occurs between <b>the</b> <b>Orions</b> and <b>the</b> Antarans, {{who come from}} a planet called Antares.|$|R
25|$|The first {{nationally known}} black {{professional}} baseball team {{was founded in}} 1885 when three clubs, the Keystone Athletics of Philadelphia, <b>the</b> <b>Orions</b> of Philadelphia, and the Manhattans of Washington, D.C., merged to form the Cuban Giants.|$|R
50|$|Nishi-Nippon Railroad, {{founded by}} Nagayoshi Nakamura, owner of Lotte and <b>the</b> <b>Orions,</b> sold <b>the</b> team's {{sponsorship}} rights to Taiheiyo Club, {{a golf course}} and resort developer. Through the 1970s, the Lions finished no higher than third.|$|R
