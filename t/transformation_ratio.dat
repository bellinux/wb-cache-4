2500|$|... 4D Basin {{analysis}} of the Santos Basin has revealed insights about the interplay among the elements and processes of the petroleum system to assess source rock potential (vertical and horizontal distribution), thermal evolution of the source rocks, <b>transformation</b> <b>ratio,</b> hydrocarbon generation and charge, timing of migration, oil origin, quality, and volume of petroleum in the main reservoirs. In a basin modeling study performed in 2008 and 2009, a detailed facies model from the pre-salt section was built based on well data and conceptual models from seismic interpretation associated with previous knowledge of the tectono-sedimentary sequences of the Santos Basin. The predicted vitrinite map, integrated with all data, indicates that the Coquinas source rock {{in most of the}} eastern half area is in the main oil window, whereas the western half is in the late oil/wet gas generation window. In terms of <b>transformation</b> <b>ratio,</b> the Barremian and Aptian source rock systems in the area reached 70% to 80% today where the main depocentres are. The charge and accumulation simulation model for the pre-salt province suggests a potential reserve in the Cluster area of Santos Basin much larger than that reported, getting numbers to 60 billion barrels of oil reserves.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to test the influence of some key input parameters in basin modelling and to evaluate the resultant effect of varying these parameters on the model. 3 D basin modelling and petroleum system analysis of the northern North Sea has been carried out using the PETROMOD software. The model was calibrated using well 34 / 8 - 7 in the Visund field. Different input parameters such as heat flow, source rock properties, fault properties, paleo water depth, source rock kinetics, migration methods and different erosion scenarios have been varied and their effects on the model assessed. The effect of the various input parameters has been assessed in terms of hydrocarbon volumes in the Kvitebjørn and Visund fields, source rock maturity, <b>transformation</b> <b>ratios,</b> hydrocarbon saturations and the time hydrocarbon generation began in the Draupne and Heather Formation source rocks. Increase in heat flow increases source rock maturity, the start of hydrocarbon generation, <b>transformation</b> <b>ratios</b> and results in the generation of a lot more gas than oil. Hydrocarbon generation starts at shallower depths with higher heat flow. Increasing Total Organic Content (TOC) and Hydrogen Index (HI) generally results in increase in the volume of hydrocarbons generated. The increase in HI, however, results in the generation of a lot more oil than gas. High TOC and HI also increase the hydrocarbon saturations in the source rock. Increasing Paleo Water Depth (PWD) has a marginal effect on the model. It increases the volume of oil and decreases the volume of gas marginally. Varying the PWD has no significant effect on source rock maturity, <b>transformation</b> <b>ratios</b> and hydrocarbon saturations. Opening the fault planes resulted in an increase in the volume of hydrocarbons generated. The increase was more evident in the volume of oil than gas. This increase in volumes is a consequence of additional migration pathways created by the faults. Varying the erosion thickness of the Draupne Formation did not have any effect on the model...|$|R

5000|$|Basic RVDT {{construction}} and operation {{is provided by}} rotating an iron-core bearing supported within a housed stator assembly. The housing is passivated stainless steel. The stator consists of a primary excitation coil {{and a pair of}} secondary output coils.A fixed alternating current excitation is applied to the primary stator coil that is electromagnetically coupled to the secondary coils. This coupling is proportional to the angle of the input shaft. The output pair is structured so that one coil is in-phase with the excitation coil, and the second is 180° out-of-phase with the excitation coil.When the rotor is in a position that directs the available flux equally in both the in-phase and out-of-phase coils, the output voltages cancel and result in a zero value signal. This {{is referred to as the}} electrical zero position or E.Z. When the rotor shaft is displaced from E.Z., the resulting output signals have a magnitude and phase relationship proportional to the direction of rotation.Because RVDTs perform essentially like a transformer, excitation voltages changes will cause directly proportional changes to the output (<b>transformation</b> <b>ratio).</b> However, the voltage out to excitation voltage ratio will remain constant. Since most RVDT signal conditioning systems measure signal as a function of the <b>transformation</b> <b>ratio</b> (TR), excitation voltage drift beyond 7.5% typically has no effect on sensor accuracy and strict voltage regulation is not typically necessary.

5000|$|To {{generate}} a sufficient field strength, the audio signal on the grids must be of high voltage. The electrostatic construction {{is in effect}} a capacitor, and current is only needed to charge the capacitance created by the diaphragm and the stator plates (previous paragraphs referred to as grids or electrodes). This type of speaker is therefore a high-impedance device. In contrast, a modern electrodynamic cone loudspeaker is a low impedance device, with higher current requirements. As a result, impedance matching is {{necessary in order to}} use a normal amplifier. Most often a transformer is used to this end. Construction of this transformer is critical as it must provide a constant (often high) <b>transformation</b> <b>ratio</b> over the entire audible frequency range (i.e. large bandwidth) and so avoid distortion. The transformer is almost always specific to a particular electrostatic speaker. To date, Acoustat built the only commercial [...] "transformer-less" [...] electrostatic loudspeaker.

50|$|Typical {{disadvantages}} include {{sensitivity to}} ambient humidity levels {{and a lack}} of bass response, due to phase cancellation from a lack of enclosure, but these are not shared by all designs. The bass rolloff 3db point occurs when the narrowest panel dimension equals a quarter wavelength of the radiated frequency for dipole radiators, so for a Quad ESL-63, which is 0.66 meters wide, this occurs at around 129 Hz, comparable to many box speakers (calculated with the speed of sound taken as 343 m/s). There is also the difficult physical challenge of reproducing low frequencies with a vibrating taut film with little excursion amplitude; however, as most diaphragms have a very large surface area compared to cone drivers, only small amplitude excursions are required to put relatively large amounts of energy out. While bass is lacking quantitatively (due to lower excursion than cone drivers) it can be of better quality ('tighter' and without 'booming') than that of electrodynamic (cone) systems. Phase cancellation can be somewhat compensated for by electronic equalization (a so-called shelving circuit that boosts the region inside the audio band where the generated sound pressure drops because of phase cancellation). Nevertheless maximum bass levels cannot be augmented because they are ultimately limited by the membrane's maximum permissible excursion before it comes too close to the high-voltage stators, which may produce electrical arcing and burn holes through it. Recent, technically more advanced solutions for perceived lack of bass include the use of large, curved panels (Sound-Lab, MartinLogan CLS), electrostatic subwoofer panels (Audiostatic, Quad), and long-throw electrostatic element allowing large diaphragm excursions (Audiostatic). Another trick often practiced is to step up the bass (20-80 Hz) with a higher <b>transformation</b> <b>ratio</b> than the mid and treble.|$|E

The experimental results were first analyzed according to the “effectiveness factor/Thiele modulus” classic approach. They were confirmed theoretically by a model based on the resolution of glucose mass balance equation. Second, the simulation of the concentration profiles of oxygen and hydrogen peroxide inside the polymer film explained the experimental data, highlighting the protection of the enzyme by the electrochemical step. The maximum conversion yield was obtained with a 500 -nm-thick polymer. As a consequence of the combined effects of oxygen regeneration and enzyme protection, the electrochemical step increased by a factor of 2 the <b>transformation</b> <b>ratios</b> obtained with immobilized GOx. Furthermore, the electrochemically enhanced process was 50 % more efficient than the equivalent homogeneous process carried out for 24 h with the same amount of enzyme...|$|R
