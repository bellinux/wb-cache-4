5|$|The {{infection}} {{has been}} preventable by vaccination since 1982. Vaccination is {{recommended by the}} World Health Organization in {{the first day of}} life if possible. <b>Two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>more</b> doses are required at a later time for full effect. This vaccine works about 95% of the time. About 180 countries gave the vaccine as part of national programs as of 2006. It is also recommended that all blood be tested for hepatitis B before transfusion and condoms be used to prevent infection. During an initial infection, care is based on the symptoms that a person has. In those who develop chronic disease, antiviral medication such as tenofovir or interferon may be useful; however, these drugs are expensive. Liver transplantation is sometimes used for cirrhosis.|$|E
25|$|Hepatitis B {{vaccine is}} a vaccine that {{prevents}} hepatitis B. The first dose is recommended within 24 hours of birth with either <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>more</b> doses given after that. This includes those with poor immune function such as from HIV/AIDS and those born premature. In healthy people routine immunization results {{in more than}} 95% of people being protected.|$|E
25|$|Most nuclear fuels contain heavy fissile {{elements}} {{that are capable of}} nuclear fission, such as uranium-235 or plutonium-239. When the unstable nuclei of these atoms are hit by a slow-moving neutron, they split, creating two daughter nuclei and <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>more</b> neutrons. These neutrons then go on to split more nuclei. This creates a self-sustaining chain reaction that is controlled in a nuclear reactor, or uncontrolled in a nuclear weapon.|$|E

25|$|There were 21 known mansas of the Mali Empire after Mari Djata I, and {{probably}} about <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>more</b> {{yet to be}} revealed. The names of these rulers come down through history via the djelis and modern descendants of the Keita dynasty residing in Kangaba. What separates these rulers from the founder, other than the latter's historic role in establishing the state, is their transformation of the Manden Kurufaba into a Manden Empire. Not content to rule fellow Manding subjects unified by the victory of Mari Djata I, these mansas would conquer and annex Fula, Wolof, Bamana, Songhai, Tuareg and countless other peoples into an immense empire.|$|E
25|$|Russia's {{third most}} popular sport, bandy, is {{important}} in Siberia. In the 2015–16 Russian Bandy Super League season Yenisey from Krasnoyarsk became champions {{for the third year}} in a row by beating Baykal-Energiya from Irkutsk in the final. <b>Two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>more</b> teams (depending on the definition of Siberia) play in the Super League, the 2016-17 champions SKA-Neftyanik from Khabarovsk as well as Kuzbass from Kemerovo and Sibselmash from Novosibirsk. In 2007 Kemerovo got Russia's first indoor arena specifically built for bandy. Now Khabarovsk has the world's biggest indoor arena specifically built for bandy, Arena Yerofey. It will be the venue for Division A of the 2018 World Championship.|$|E
500|$|McNeill {{also agreed}} with Biller's view that [...] "Unity" [...] was {{a metaphor for}} the {{break-up}} of the USSR, and McNeill read up on the subject before directing the episode, saying that [...] "I think some of those ideas did come out in the story, even though it wasn't a really heavy, political episode. Yet there were some references and you could connect that to contemporary issues, individuality as opposed to group needs or desires." [...] McNeill was very happy with the resulting episode, saying that the Borg [...] "were not as one-dimensional as previously depicted, but still as evil as ever", and hoped to direct <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>more</b> episodes in the [...] By the end of Voyager, he had directed four episodes overall; this signalled a change in direction for his career into directing full-time.|$|E

500|$|Vietnam War resisters in 1977, Satin began giving {{talks on}} New Age Politics in the United States. [...] His first talk {{received}} a standing ovation, and he wept. [...] Every talk seemed {{to lead to}} <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>more,</b> and [...] "the response at New Age gatherings, community events, fairs, bookstores, living rooms, and college campuses" [...] kept Satin going for two years. [...] By the second year he began {{laying the groundwork for}} the New World Alliance, a national political organization based in Washington, D.C. [...] "I went systematically to 24 cities and regions from coast to coast", he told the authors of the book Networking.

500|$|On 30 March 2005 the BBC {{confirmed}} that Eccleston {{would not be}} staying in the role for a second series, claiming that he was scared of being typecast. On 4 April they admitted that this statement had been made without consulting the actor, and were forced to apologise. Speaking to the Yorkshire Evening Post in 2010, Eccleston denied that he left due to fear of being typecast. He stated that he [...] "didn't enjoy {{the environment and the}} culture that we, the cast and crew, had to work in" [...] and {{that he did not want}} to do any more based on the experience. He said, [...] "I wasn't comfortable. I thought 'If I stay in this job, I'm going to have to blind myself to certain things that I thought were wrong.' And I think it's more important to be your own man than be successful, so I left. But the most important thing is that I did it, not that I left. I really feel that, because it kind of broke the mould and it helped to reinvent it. I'm very proud of it." [...] According to the Sunday Mirror, an interview for BBC's Doctor Who website that was taken down after his departure revealed that Eccleston had planned to stay for <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>more</b> years. In March 2013 a source for the BBC indicated that Eccleston had discussed plans for Doctor Whos 50th anniversary special, which aired in November 2013, with Davies' successor as executive producer, Steven Moffat. After consideration, he decided not to return to the series. Had he returned, his incarnation would have played the role that ultimately became the War Doctor, portrayed by John Hurt.|$|E

2500|$|Other sources instead dispute those claims, {{pointing}} out that, {{in the immediate}} aftermath of the battle, the moods of the two commanders were quite different. Campioni wrote that, even having been able to employ only two old refurbished battleships, the battle gave to every man in the fleet, from the senior officers to the seamen, the impression of being able to cope with the British Fleet on equal terms. Cunningham, conversely, was dismayed by the performance of his two older units, whose lack of speed permitted the Italians to dictate the course of the action, and whose cannon were outranged not only by those of the two Italian battleships, but by those of the heavy cruisers as well. Cunningham dismissed the Royal Sovereign as a [...] "constant source of anxiety", and asked the Admiralty for <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>more</b> Queen Elizabeth-class battleships, possibly equipped with radar, a new carrier with an armoured deck, the heavy cruisers York and Exeter, and enough smaller ships to cover the major units.|$|E
2500|$|Wainwright's book {{describes}} the route in 12 stages, {{each of which}} ends at a settlement with at least some overnight accommodation nearby. [...] If one stage is walked per day, {{with one or two}} rest days, the route makes a two-week holiday, and web logs of coast-to-coasters seem to indicate that this is the most common way of walking the route. [...] However, Wainwright explicitly states that he did not intend people to necessarily stick to these daily stages, or even to his route. [...] For instance, the majority of Wainwright's stages start and end at low level with a single up-down during the day: many walkers split the Borrowdale–Patterdale stage at Grasmere in order to maintain this pattern and avoid having two major uphill sections in one day. [...] Splitting <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>more</b> of the longer stages, and adding a further one or two rest days, reduces the average day-length to 10 or 12 miles and makes the walk a much easier three-week trip with time to [...] "stand and stare", an activity much approved of by Wainwright.|$|E

He can run 100 yards in less than 11 seconds and could easily make the varsity tennis and basket ball teams if he wished.

However, the publication of [...] offered a definite answer {{to the question of}} age.
