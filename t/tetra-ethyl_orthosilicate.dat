40|$|A {{series of}} Si 4 +-Mg 2 + couple {{substituted}} in the Al {{site of the}} host lattice, (Y,Gd) 3 Al 5 - 2 y(Mg,Si) yO 12 :Ce 3 + (y= 0 ~ 2) were prepared by spray pyrolysis and their photoluminescence characteristics and thermal stabilities were studied. B(OH) 3 flux was used to improve the emission intensity of the (Y,Gd) 3 Al(Mg,Si) 2 O 12 :Ce 3 + phosphor. As increasing the Si-Mg content (up to y= 2), the emission wavelength was gradually shifted from 550 nm to 582 nm, accompanying with {{a significant decrease in}} the emission intensity. In terms of emission intensity and thermal quenching, Si 3 N 4 nanopowder was better than <b>tetra-ethyl</b> <b>orthosilicate</b> (TEOS) as a Si precursor. The use of B(OH) 3 as a flux was effective to enhance the emission intensity which could be improved almost 170 % compared with phosphors synthesized without fluxes...|$|E
