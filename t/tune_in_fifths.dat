25|$|The lowest five strings are <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> perfect <b>fifths</b> {{from a low}} C. The first string is a minor third up {{from the}} E to a G. Since the lowest five strings are <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths,</b> guitars with NST can be played with the fingerings for chords and scales used on the violin, cello, and mandolin.|$|R
25|$|Brescian {{mandolin}}s {{that have}} survived in museums have four gut strings instead of six. The mandolin was <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths,</b> like the Neapolitan mandolin.|$|R
5000|$|Four strings with {{alternative}} tunings {{to obtain an}} extended lower range. <b>Tuning</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths</b> e.g., C-G-D-A (like a violoncello but an octave lower) gives an extended upper and lower range.|$|R
25|$|Orchestral kobza, {{with four}} strings <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths</b> using tunings that {{parallel}} {{those used by}} the instruments of the violin family. The instruments are made in prima (soprano), alto and tenor and contrabass sizes.|$|R
5000|$|The laouto's eight strings are paired, tuned {{an octave}} apart. The {{interval}} from one pair {{to the next}} is <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths</b> (Cc-Gg-Dd-aa). The Laouto has a re-entrant tuning, Gg tuned a fourth lower than Cc.|$|R
25|$|The {{instrument}} has had {{to compete}} in Ukraine with native instruments that have been revived, such as the kobza. The orchestral variant of the kobza {{is similar to the}} Mandolin, having four strings and being <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths.</b>|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{members of}} the violin family, which are <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths,</b> viols are usually <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> fourths with a major third in the middle, {{mirroring}} the tuning employed on the vihuela de mano and lute during the 16th century and {{similar to that of}} the modern six-string guitar.|$|R
50|$|A related instrument, the Bahian guitar, was {{developed}} in Brazil beginning in the 1940s. Bahian guitars typically have a solid body and 4 or 5 single-course strings <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths,</b> but {{are considered to be}} electric versions of the cavaquinho rather than the mandolin.|$|R
50|$|The {{contemporary}} lyra {{replaces the}} drone strings with three strings in succession (d-a-e'). The contemporary lyra modelled after Stagakis' design is <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths,</b> {{and like the}} violin, it uses no drone string, and all strings may be fingered and used as melody strings.|$|R
50|$|Note: While the Small Bass and Contrabass violins were {{designed}} and originally {{meant to be}} <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths,</b> most bassists find the required extra shifting impractical. The New Violin Family Association lists tunings for these instruments in fourths, while the Hutchins Quartet retains the original fifths tuning.|$|R
25|$|A {{variation}} of all-fifths tuning {{was used by}} jazz-guitarist Carl Kress. The bottom four strings are <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths</b> and the top two strings <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> thirds resulting in Bb-F-C-G-B-D. This results in tenor banjo formations on the bottom four strings and plectrum banjo formations on the top four strings. This tuning is also used by contemporary New York jazz-guitarist Marty Grosz.|$|R
5000|$|A {{small number}} of bass players <b>tune</b> their strings <b>in</b> <b>fifths,</b> like a cello but an octave lower (C-G-D-A low to high). This tuning {{was used by the}} jazz player Red Mitchell and is used by some {{classical}} players, notably the Canadian bassist Joel Quarrington. Advocates of <b>tuning</b> the bass <b>in</b> <b>fifths</b> point out that all of the other orchestral strings are <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths</b> (violin, viola and cello), so this puts the bass <b>in</b> the same <b>tuning</b> approach. Fifth tuning provides a bassist with a wider range of pitch than a standard E-A-D-G bass, as it ranges (without an extension) from C1 to A2. Some players who use fifths tuning who play a five-string bass use an additional high string (thus, from lowest to highest: C-G-D-A-E). Some fifth tuning bassists who only have a four string instrument and who are mainly performing soloistic works use the G-D-A-E tuning, thus omitting the low C string but gaining a high E. Some fifth tuning bassists who use a five-string use a smaller scale instrument, thus making fingering somewhat easier. The Berlioz-Strauss Treatise on Instrumentation (first published in 1844) states that, [...] "A good orchestra should have several four-string double-basses, some of them <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths</b> and thirds." [...] The book then shows a tuning of (E-G-D-A) from bottom to top string. [...] "Together with the other double-basses <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> fourths, a combination of open strings would be available, which would greatly increase the sonority of the orchestra." ...|$|R
5000|$|Chango {{a larger}} {{member of the}} charango family, from 104 to 108 cm long with a scale of about 80-84 cm. It has 20 nylon strings set in ten courses, two strings to a course, and is <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths.</b> Invented <b>in</b> Bolivia by the Shuarscovliente brothers, it has no frets; the strings are played open.|$|R
50|$|The 8-string {{instrument}} {{appears to}} {{always have been}} <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths,</b> either two octaves below the mandolin: G1 D2 A2 E3, or two octaves below the mandola: C1, G1, D2 A2. There is scant information as to how frequently this lower tuning(which places the instrument at a lower pitch than the orchestral double bass)was employed, or in what circumstances.|$|R
25|$|Other {{mandolin}} varieties differ {{primarily in}} the number of strings and include four-string models (<b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths)</b> such as the Brescian and Cremonese, six-string types (<b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> fourths) such as the Milanese, Lombard and the Sicilian and 6 course instruments of 12 strings (two strings per course) such as the Genoese. There has also been a twelve-string (three strings per course) type and an instrument with sixteen-strings (four strings per course).|$|R

50|$|The liuto cantabilis, {{a type of}} mandocello {{also known}} as the liuto moderno, had five courses of strings <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths</b> to C C-G G-d d-a a-e' e'. It resembled the Neapolitan mandolin, 39 inches long with 20 frets. Its music was written in the bass clef except for solo parts which were written as for the guitar in the treble clef (but {{sounding}} an octave lower).|$|R
5000|$|It {{measures}} 80 cm {{in height}} and 16 cm in breadth. [...] The resonator is pear-shaped {{and made of}} either a single piece or multiple carvels of mulberry wood. [...] The neck is made of walnut and has fourteen frets, arranged in a semi-tempered chromatic scale. It has two steel strings <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifth,</b> fourth, or second intervals. The higher string may be double-coursed.|$|R
5000|$|The basolia (Басо́ля, basy or basetla) is a Ukrainian or Polish folk {{instrument}} of the bowed string family similar to the cello, although usually slightly larger and not as sophisticated in construction. The basolia was usually homemade and of very rough construction. Sometimes the soundboard was sewn to the body rather than glued. The strings are <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths.</b> Three different types are found in Ukraine: ...|$|R
5000|$|Whatever the {{resemblance}} to a flatback mandolin, there are differences: the mandolin is a smaller instrument, the soprano member of its family, <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths</b> with the strings {{having the same}} tuning and range as the violin. The bandolón {{is closer to the}} bandurria, <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> fourths with strings that have a range closer to the guitar's (having not only strings tuned to high notes approaching the mandolin's, but also low note strings, well below the mandolins range.) ...|$|R
50|$|Electric violins {{may have}} four strings, or {{as many as}} seven strings. Since the {{strength}} of materials imposes limits on the upper string, it is usually tuned to E5, with additional strings <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths</b> below the usual G3 of a typical four-string violin. The five-string electric violin shown in the gallery below was built by John Jordan in the early 21st century, and is tuned C G D A E.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} strings on the rebec varies from 1 to 5, {{although}} three {{is the most}} common number. The strings are often <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths,</b> although this <b>tuning</b> is not universal. The instrument was originally in the treble range, like the violin, but later larger versions were developed, so that by the 16th century composers were able to write pieces for consorts of rebecs, just as they did for consorts of viols.|$|R
5000|$|The mandola (US and Canada) or tenor mandola (Ireland and UK) is a fretted, {{stringed}} musical instrument. It {{is to the}} mandolin {{what the}} viola is to the violin: the four double courses of strings <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths</b> to the same pitches as the viola (C-G-D-A low-to-high), a fifth lower than a mandolin. The mandola, although now rarer, is the ancestor of the mandolin, the name of which means simply [...] "little mandola".|$|R
2500|$|When he {{was asked}} whether <b>tuning</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths</b> [...] {{facilitates}} [...] "new intervals or harmonies that aren't readily available in standard tuning", Robert Fripp responded, [...] "It's a more rational system, but it's also better sounding—better for chords, better for single notes." [...] To build chords, Fripp uses [...] "perfect intervals <b>in</b> fourths, <b>fifths</b> and octaves", so avoiding minor thirds and especially major thirds, which are sharp <b>in</b> equal temperament <b>tuning</b> (<b>in</b> comparison to thirds in just intonation). It {{is a challenge to}} adapt conventional guitar-chords to new standard tuning, which is based on all-fifths tuning. Some closely voiced jazz chords become impractical in NST and all-fifths tuning.|$|R
50|$|All string {{instruments}} {{share similar}} form, parts, construction and function, and the viols bear a particularly close {{resemblance to the}} violin family. However, instruments in the violin family are set apart from viols by similarities <b>in</b> shape, <b>tuning</b> practice and history. Violin family instruments have four strings each, are <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths</b> (except the double bass, which is <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> fourths), are not fretted and have four rounded bouts while always having a sound post and bass bar inside. In contrast, the viol family instruments usually have five to six strings with a fretted fingerboard, are <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> fourths and thirds, often have sloping shoulders, {{and do not necessarily}} have a sound post or bass bar.|$|R
50|$|Its {{technique}} {{is closer to}} that of the mandolin than that of the pipa, using a plectrum and frequently using the tremolo technique. Its strings are either <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths,</b> G-D-A-E (as a mandolin or violin), or else in a mixture of fourths and fifths, as for example G-D-G-D, which is a more common tuning employed by mainstream players of the liuqin. This makes playing of the liuqin exactly the same as the ruan, hence players of either the liuqin or the ruan often double on both instruments.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the treble viol {{and other}} viol instruments, the pardessus usually has only five strings. The five string pardessus is <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths</b> and fourths (g, d', a', d, g), while six {{stringed}} pardessus are tuned like other viols in fourths {{with a third}} (g, c', e', a', d, g or g, c', f', a', d, g). Like on the treble viol, players disagreed on whether the pardessus should be fingered with diatonic fingering (like on a violin) or chromatic fingering (like other viols, violoncelli and bass violins).|$|R
50|$|The work {{falls into}} three {{distinct}} sections albeit in one movement. The opening section is marked Tranquillo, and begins quietly {{with the first}} violin sounding the note D which is joined by an upward moving line. By this means the vastness of space is evoked, and this whole first section develops slowly but purposefully in an organic way. Simpson likened {{the control of the}} music throughout this quartet to gravitation in space, particularly in regards to the open strings of the instruments, all of which are <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Tenor guitars are {{normally}} <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths</b> (usually C3 G3 D4 A4, {{similar to the}} tenor banjo, mandola, or the viola) although other tunings are also common, such as [...] "guitar tuning", [...] "Chicago tuning," [...] or baritone ukulele tuning (D3 G3 B3 E4), [...] "Irish" [...] or [...] "octave mandolin" [...] tuning (G2 D3 A3 E4, like a violin but one octave below) and various [...] "open" [...] tunings, for slide playing. The tenor guitar can also be tuned like a soprano/concert/tenor ukulele, using various versions of G3 C4 E4 A4 tuning.|$|R
50|$|As noted earlier, several tunings were {{employed}} for the mando-bass, {{depending on the}} style {{and size of the}} individual instrument, player's preference, and the requirements of the music to be performed. Tuning on the full-sized 4-string instrument was commonly in fourths, and identical to the orchestral double bass: E1 A1 D2 G2. This <b>tuning</b> was favored <b>in</b> both America and also quite common in Europe. Smaller, shorter-scaled instruments were more usually <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths,</b> two octaves below the mandolin: G1, D2 A2 E3. In Europe, especially, this tuning was sometimes preferred even for the larger instrument.|$|R
40|$|In 1966, Red Mitchell began <b>tuning</b> his bass <b>in</b> <b>fifths</b> to {{meet the}} demands of film composers who {{required}} a low C. Having played in fourths for approximately twenty years, Mitchell required only nine days to adapt to fifths tuning. This thesis examines the changes that fifths tuning had on his walking bass lines through the transcription, analysis and comparison of three blues from each of Mitchell's tuning periods. The analysis will probe changes in pitch, range, intervals and motives. Other chapters include a biography of Mitchell's career and one that discusses why he chose <b>fifths.</b> Included <b>in</b> this section are brief summaries of other bassists who have adopted fifths tuning. The chapter on bass line grammar discusses those elements that were affected when Mitchell changed tunings. The concluding chapter discusses the findings showing that <b>tuning</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths</b> did have an effect on Red Mitchell's walking bass lines...|$|R
50|$|Contrabass or double bass. These {{terms are}} again {{problematic}} from {{a historical perspective}} (often meaning something slightly different from a modern reader might expect), but here refer to three- or four-string instruments that (usually) do not have frets—of all the types of violoni, {{these are the ones}} that most closely resemble modern double basses. The strings may be <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> fourths (E1-A1-D2-G2 like most modern double basses) or <b>in</b> <b>fifths</b> (C1-G1-D2-A2 a full octave lower than the cello), and if there are only 3 strings, the missing string is almost always the lowest one (i.e. A1-D2-G2 or G1-D2-A2). In the 18th and 19th century, many bassists used only three strings, as it was thought that removing a string made the instrument more sonorous and resonant. It may also be <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths</b> (C1-G1-D2).|$|R
25|$|A violin is <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> <b>fifths,</b> <b>in</b> {{the notes}} G3, D4, A4, E5. The lowest note of a violin, tuned normally, is G3, or G below middle C. (On rare occasions, the lowest string may be tuned down {{by as much}} as a fourth, to D3.) The highest note is less well defined: E7, the E two octaves above the open string (which is tuned to E5) may be {{considered}} a practical limit for orchestral violin parts, but it is often possible to play higher, depending on the length of the fingerboard and the skill of the violinist. Yet higher notes (up to C8) can be sounded using artificial harmonics.|$|R
