40|$|Background - The 10 -item Birth Satisfaction Scale-Revised (BSS-R) {{is being}} {{increasingly}} used internationally. The {{use of the}} measure and the concept has gathered traction in the United States following {{the development of a}} US version of the tool. A limitation of previous studies of <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the BSS-R is modest sample size. Unplanned pregnancy is recognised as being associated with a range of negative birth outcomes, but the relationship to birth satisfaction has received little attention, despite the importance of birth satisfaction to a range of postnatal outcomes. Aim - The current investigation sought to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the BSS-R in a large postpartum sample. Methods - Multiple Groups Confirmatory Factor Analysis (MGCFA) was used to evaluate a series of measurement and structural models of the BSS-R to evaluate fundamental invariance characteristics using planned/unplanned pregnancy status to differentiate groups. Findings - Complete data from N =  2116 women revealed that the US version of the BSS-R offers an excellent fit to data and demonstrates full measurement and structural invariance. Little difference was observed between women on the basis of planned/unplanned pregnancy stratification on measures of birth satisfaction. Discussion - The established relationship between unplanned pregnancy and negative perinatal outcomes was not found to extend to birth satisfaction in the current study. The BSS-R demonstrated exemplary measurement and structural invariance characteristics. Conclusion - The current study strongly supports the use of the US version of the BSS-R to compare birth satisfaction across different groups of women with theoretical and measurement confidence...|$|E

40|$|Optical fiber sensors are {{increasingly}} used for monitoring purposes, but flexible smart structures based {{in this type}} of technology have many industrial applications. This paper explores a new approach for integrating optical fiber sensors in flexible substrates that can be mounted in host structures to monitor. This approach combines two well establish components, Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors and flexible skin-foils. A three-layer foil construction based on the spread-coating process was defined, in which the fiber was embedded in the middle layer. Such disposition ensured protection to the optical fiber element without reducing the sensitivity to external stimulus. The functional prototypes were subject to thermal and mechanical tests, in which its performance was evaluated. The smart structure behaves linearly to temperature cycles by 0. 01 nm/°C and is able to withstand high strain cycles without affecting <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The obtained results validated this approach.

40|$|We {{propose to}} {{continuously}} monitor a charge qubit by utilizing a T-shaped double quantum dot detector, {{in which the}} qubit and double dot are arranged in such a unique way that the detector {{turns out to be}} particularly susceptible to the charge states of the qubit. Special attention is paid to the regime where acquisition of qubit information and backaction upon the measured system exhibit nontrivial correlation. The intrinsic dynamics of the qubit gives rise to dynamical blockade of tunneling events through the detector, resulting in a super-Poissonian noise. However, such a pronounced enhancement of detector's shot noise does not necessarily produce a rising dephasing rate. In contrast, an inhibition of dephasing is entailed by the reduction of information acquisition in the dynamically blockaded regimes. We further reveal the important impact of the charge fluctuations on <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Noticeably, under the condition of symmetric junction capacitances the noise pedestal of circuit current is completely suppressed, leading to a divergent signal-to-noise ratio, and eventually to a violation of the Korotkov-Averin bound in quantum measurement.
