5|$|In a new {{affidavit}} (his second affidavit {{and third}} statement), Conley admitted he had lied about his Friday meeting with Frank. He {{said he had}} met Frank on the street on Saturday, and was told to follow him to the factory. Frank told him to hide in a wardrobe to avoid being seen by <b>two</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> were visiting Frank in his office. He said Frank dictated the murder notes for him to write, gave him cigarettes, then told {{him to leave the}} factory. Afterward, Conley said he went out drinking and saw a movie. He said he did not learn of the murder until he went to work on Monday.|$|E
5|$|The Bangladeshi {{delegation}} {{consisted of}} four officials and four competitors: {{two men and}} <b>two</b> <b>women,</b> <b>who</b> took part in three different sports—athletics, boxing and swimming. (At the previous Commonwealth Youth Games, Bangladesh had a delegation of ten athletes.) None of the athletes won any medals. Papia Rani Sarkar finished sixth in the semifinal round of the 100 metres for women; bantamweight boxer Riyad Hossen received a bye into the quarterfinal, but then lost to Obedy Mutapa of Zambia. In the swimming heats, Sonia Akter finished 22nd in the 50m backstroke and 19th in the 50m butterfly, and Anik Islam finished 12th in the 50m butterfly and 14th in the 100m butterfly.|$|E

5|$|CMLL held a 15-woman torneo cibernetico {{elimination}} {{match on}} June 5, 1992 {{to determine the}} <b>two</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> would fight for the newly created CMLL World Women's champion the following week. La Diabólica was originally scheduled to work the match, but did not appear {{which led to the}} uneven sides in the elimination match. Several of the participants had recently joined CMLL, leaving the Universal Wrestling Association to join CMLL and its recently restarted women's division. Zuleyma was the reigning UWA World Women's Championship going into the match and CMLL allowed her to keep and defend the UWA championship in the years following Zuleyma's jump to CMLL. The finals came down to Lola Gonzales, a pioneer for women's wrestling in Mexico, and Bull Nakano, a Japanese wrestler that worked regularly for CMLL. The following week, on June 12, 1993 Bull Nakano became the first CMLL World Women's Champion by virtue of her victory over Lola Gonzales.|$|E

25|$|The trial {{took place}} in late January and early February 1943; Flynn's attorney, Jerry Giesler, impugned the accusers' {{character}} and morals, and accused them of numerous indiscretions, including affairs with married men and, in Satterlee's case, an abortion (which was illegal at the time). He noted that the <b>two</b> <b>women,</b> <b>who</b> {{said they did not}} know each other, filed their complaints within days of each other, although the episodes allegedly took place more than a year apart. He implied that the women had cooperated with prosecutors in hopes of avoiding prosecution themselves. Flynn was acquitted, but the trial's widespread coverage and lurid overtones permanently damaged his carefully cultivated screen image as an idealised romantic leading player.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} the {{criminal}} began acting more randomly, not attacking waitresses exclusively and even going after <b>two</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> were together. On May 15, specialists determined that the note had been produced in Dr. Octavian Ienişte's office in March 1971. He had seen 83 students that month, of whom 15, including Rîmaru, had not deposited their diagnoses with university officials. The police closely monitored each suspect and three officers went to his dormitory on May 27; he was not home but while they searched his room he came back at 1:00 pm. In his sack he had an ax and a knife; tests on the hair and bite marks he left and the testimony of witnesses left no reasonable doubt as to his guilt.|$|E
25|$|Neighbors {{positively}} identified Wilkerson {{as one of}} the <b>two</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> {{had been}} led out from the wreckage. Boudin was not positively identified as the second survivor until some weeks later. Both women were charged with illegal possession of dynamite in the townhouse blast. They forfeited their bail on the above-mentioned Chicago assault charges by failing to appear in Chicago for trial ten days later. The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) placed them on its Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, but they succeeded in avoiding capture for a decade. Wilkerson surrendered in 1980. Boudin was apprehended in 1981 for her role in the Brink's armored car robbery. Boudin was later hired by Columbia University as an adjunct professor.|$|E
