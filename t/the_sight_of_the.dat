5|$|The convoy {{arrived at}} Addu Atoll {{on the evening}} of 9 February, and {{anchored}} there to refuel and take on supplies. This atoll served as a secret supply base for Allied vessels in the Indian Ocean, and the Australian soldiers were not told where they were while the refuelling took place. The troops were also not permitted to go ashore, but regarded <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tropical atoll as a welcome change from the arid Middle East. After the ships were refuelled, the convoy sailed on the afternoon of 10 February.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{arrived at}} Fremantle on 18 February. <b>The</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian coast had been eagerly {{anticipated}} by the soldiers, who broke into cheers {{when it became}} visible shortly before noon that day.

The Western Australian members of the 9th Division were disembarked, and the ships loaded supplies and mail. As Queen of Bermuda left the convoy at Fremantle, her remaining 517 passengers were transferred to Nieuw Amsterdam. This resulted in considerable overcrowding {{for the remainder of the}} liner's voyage.|$|E

During the night, the waves stove in (smashed in) the stern of the ship, flooding much of the interior. On the morning of 15January, a small boat carrying nine British prisoners (part of the crew of the Cumberland, captured by Droits de l'Homme earlier in the campaign) managed to reach shore. <b>The</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British-manned boat reaching shore prompted a mass launching of small rafts from the wreck in hopes of gaining the beach.

5|$|At {{the drop}} zone the pathfinders and Royal Engineers were {{removing}} anti-glider poles {{so that the}} brigade's glider force could land. The gliders, except for those carrying the anti-tank battery, which were unable to locate the site in the heavy mist and had returned to Italy, landed successfully at 09:20. The other gliders and towing aircraft had circled until the mist cleared. It was <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gliders landing that persuaded the Germans at Clastron to surrender. By 10:15 the brigade had achieved all its objectives apart from capturing Le Muy, which had been allocated to the 5th (Scottish) Battalion. Units of the brigade fought off several counter-attacks supported by the 64th Airlanding Battery's guns. The missing men continued {{to come into the}} brigade's area during the morning, and contact was made with American units who had dropped west and south of them.|$|E
5|$|Ernest was {{the subject}} of more {{allegations}} in 1832, when two young women accused him of trying to ride them down as they walked near Hammersmith. The Duke had not left his grounds at Kew on the day in question, and was able to ascertain that the rider was one of his equerries, who professed not to have seen the women. Nevertheless, newspapers continued to print references to the incident, suggesting that Ernest had done what the women stated, and was cravenly trying to push blame on another. The same year, the Duke sued for libel after a book appeared accusing him of having his valet Neale kill Sellis, and the jury found against the author. Also in 1832, the Cumberlands suffered tragedy, as young Prince George went blind. The Prince had been blind in one eye from infancy; an accident at age thirteen took <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other. Ernest had hoped his son might marry Princess Victoria and keep the British and Hanoverian Thrones united, but the handicap made it unlikely George could win Princess Victoria's hand, and raised questions about whether he should succeed in Hanover.|$|E
5|$|Finally, in late 1279 {{or early}} 1280, he {{returned}} to Euboea, landing in the norther town of Oreos and moving south towards Negroponte. His forces by now included many Spanish and Catalan mercenaries (the first time the latter are mentioned in Greece) and even former adherents of Manfred of Sicily, who had fled to Greece after Manfred's defeat and death {{at the hands of}} Charles of Anjou. As he reached Negroponte, the triarch Giberto II da Verona, Felisa's brother, and John I de la Roche, the Duke of Athens, who were present at the city, rode out with their forces to meet him. The two armies met at the village of Vatondas, northeast of Negroponte. The battle resulted in a major victory for Licario: John de la Roche was unhorsed and captured, while Giberto was either killed (according to Sanudo) or captured and taken along with de la Roche as a prisoner to Constantinople, where, according to Nikephoros Gregoras, <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hated renegade, moving triumphantly among the assembled Byzantine court, caused him to drop dead.|$|E

Though Eric speculates to Jenni that Mickey, who was a childhood friend of Marion and thus dislikes Jenni, may be behind the trickery, Jenni worries that she is going insane. Eric suggests to remove Marion's self-portrait from the home. Eric and Jenni take the painting outside and burn it.

5|$|On June 28, Washington {{learned that}} the British fleet had set sail from Halifax on June 9 and were heading toward New York. On June 29, signals were sent from men {{stationed}} on Staten Island, indicating that the British fleet had appeared. Within a few hours, 45 British ships dropped anchor in Lower New York Bay. Less than a week later, there were 130 ships off Staten Island {{under the command of}} Richard Howe, the brother of the general. The population of New York went into panic at <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British ships; alarms went off and troops immediately rushed to their posts. On July 2, British troops began to land on Staten Island. The continental regulars on the island took a few shots at them before fleeing, and the citizens' militia switched over to the British side.|$|E

Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) and Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn) discover the orb brought over from the Stargazer in Picard's chest. They take it to Riker as the Stargazer powers up its weapon systems.

5|$|Tegettoff {{turned his}} ships {{back to the}} south to chase Suenson, who in turn altered course to try {{to cut off the}} Prussian gunboats. As Schwarzenberg turned, the {{distance}} closed to just over , and she came under fire from all three Danish vessels. Jylland and Hejmdal then shifted fire to Radetzky. The Prussian vessels remained on the disengaged side of the Austrian frigates, firing at the Danish vessels with little effect. One of the Austrian vessels scored a hit on Jylland that killed or wounded all the men in one of her gun crews. The crews of the guns on either side fled their positions at <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carnage until one of the men returned, calling his comrades to join him. During this period of the battle, Schwarzenberg suffered multiple shell hits and was set afire three times.

5|$|The first {{clash between}} the two armies {{occurred}} on the same evening of 5 October, when Wang sent several hundred of his cavalry to attack Shan Xionxin's camp on the plain. Li sent forces from the hills to his general's aid, but the battle ended quickly {{with the arrival of}} night. This attack {{was nothing more than a}} diversion, drawing Li's attention to the east while, under cover of night, Wang sent 200 of his cavalry around and behind Li's forces. Concealing themselves in a ravine behind Li's camp, they waited. During the night Wang laid bridges across the canal, and before dawn his army crossed over and deployed in battle formation close to Li Mi's camps. At daybreak, Li Mi's troops were caught entirely by surprise at <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle-ready enemy advancing onto them. As the camps were unfortified, the rebel troops tried to hastily form a battle line themselves, but they were unable to prevent Wang's forces from entering their encampments. At the same time, Wang signalled his hidden cavalry to attack. Charging down from the north into Li Mi's camp, the 200 horsemen began setting fire to it. At <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camp to their rear going up in flames, Li Mi's army broke and fled. While Li Mi was able to escape with some 10,000 of his men, many of the rest surrendered to Wang. According to one account, Wang's victory was secured by a stratagem: one of his soldiers, who greatly resembled Li Mi, was bound and displayed to the rebel troops at the height of the battle, whereupon the latter collapsed.|$|E
5|$|The {{garden was}} {{demolished}} in the 1960s, {{as was the}} golf house (in 1967). In the garden's location and replacing {{the use of the}} golf house, a wing was added to the clubhouse, constructed on the northeast terrace and completed in 1962. The building holds a pro shop, dining facilities, and locker rooms. The structure was designed to be spacious and convenient and not be noticeable from the grounds below, although from Woodlea, <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tar roof and ventilators was noted to be worse than the prior standing gardens. The club hosted the NYNEX Commemorative from 1986 to 1993. In 1989, professional golfer Bob Charles set a current record when he won the tournament.
