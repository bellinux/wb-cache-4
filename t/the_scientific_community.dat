5|$|Conservapedia's {{article on}} {{evolution}} presents evolution as a naturalistic theory that lacks support and that conflicts with {{evidence in the}} fossil record that creationists perceive to support creationism. The entry also suggests that sometimes the Bible has been more scientifically correct than <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>community.</b> Schlafly has defended the statement as presenting an alternative to evolution.|$|E

5|$|Despite its {{rejection}} within <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>community,</b> MacDougall's experiment popularized {{the idea}} that the soul has weight, and specifically that it weighs 21 grams. Most notably, '21 Grams' was taken as the title of a film in 2003, which references the experiment.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 the Society for Marine Mammalogy began {{considering}} the Bolivian (Inia geoffrensis boliviensis) and Amazonian (Inia geoffrensis geoffrensis) subspecies as full species Inia boliviensis and Inia geoffrensis, respectively; however, much of <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>community,</b> including the IUCN, continue {{to consider the}} Bolivian population to be a subspecies of Inia geoffrensis.|$|E
5|$|Luna {{was active}} as a {{researcher}} in <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>community.</b> After receiving his doctorate in 1893, he published a scientific treatise on malaria entitled On Malarial Pathology (El Hematozoario del Paludismo), which was favorably received in <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>community.</b> He then went to Belgium and France, and worked as assistant to Dr. Latteaux at the Pasteur Institute and to Dr. Laffen. In recognition of his ability, he was commissioned by the Spanish government to study tropical and communicable diseases. In 1894, {{he returned to the}} Philippines where he took part in an examination to determine who would become the chief chemist of the Municipal Laboratory of Manila. Luna came in first and won the position.|$|E

5|$|Steorn {{challenged}} <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>community</b> {{to investigate}} their claim and, in December 2006, {{said that it}} had chosen a jury of scientists to do so. In June 2009 the jury gave its unanimous verdict that Steorn had not demonstrated the production of energy.|$|E
5|$|Teller became {{controversial}} in 1954 when he testified against Oppenheimer at Oppenheimer's security clearance hearing. Teller had clashed with Oppenheimer many times at Los Alamos over issues relating both to fission and fusion research, and during Oppenheimer's trial {{he was the}} only member of <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>community</b> to state that Oppenheimer should not be granted security clearance.|$|E

5|$|After {{selecting}} the landing site for Apollo 16, sampling the Descartes and Cayley formations, two geologic {{units of the}} lunar highlands, was determined by mission planners {{to be the primary}} sampling interest of the mission. It was these formations that <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>community</b> widely suspected were formed by lunar volcanism, but this hypothesis was proven incorrect by the composition of lunar samples from the mission.|$|E
5|$|As {{a working-class}} woman, Anning was an {{outsider}} to <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>community.</b> At {{the time in}} Britain women {{were not allowed to}} vote, hold public office, or attend university. The newly formed, but increasingly influential Geological Society of London did not allow women to become members, or even to attend meetings as guests. The only occupations generally open to working-class women were farm labour, domestic service, and work in the newly opening factories.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{popularity}} and exposure, the Flying Spaghetti Monster {{is often used}} as a contemporary version of Russell's teapot—an argument that the philosophic burden of proof lies upon those who make unfalsifiable claims, not on those who reject them. Pastafarianism has received praise from <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>community</b> and criticism from proponents of intelligent design. Pastafarians have engaged in disputes with creationists, including in Polk County, Florida, where they {{played a role in}} dissuading the local school board from adopting new rules on teaching evolution.|$|E

5|$|Champollion, {{a liberal}} and {{progressive}} minded man, {{lived in a}} period of political turmoil in France which continuously threatened to disrupt his research in various ways. During the Napoleonic wars he was able to avoid conscription, but his Napoleonic allegiances meant that he was considered suspect by the subsequent Royalist regime. His own actions, sometimes brash and reckless, did not help his case. His relations with important political and scientific figures of the time, such as Joseph Fourier and Silvestre de Sacy helped him, although in some periods he lived exiled from <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>community.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chapter 6 {{looks at}} {{solutions}} to the problem. Cowen praises the development of India and China as producers and consumers, {{the role of the}} internet in enlarging <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>community,</b> and a growing consensus for the reform of educational policy in the US. He further suggests for the social status of scientists to be raised to at least as strong a motivating factor as money can.|$|E
5|$|Gilruth asked Jeannette {{to work as}} a {{consultant}} at NASA. She accepted and lived in a house in Houston she shared with another woman. Jeannette spoke to <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>community</b> and to the public at NASA about the space program from 1964 to 1970, when Project Apollo was created and Apollo 11 made the first manned Moon landing in 1969.

5|$|He was {{undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} greatest natural history explorers of the 19th century. Despite this, his fame faded quickly after his death. For a long time, he was treated as a relatively obscure figure in the history of science. A number of reasons have been suggested for this lack of attention, including his modesty, his willingness to champion unpopular causes without regard for his own reputation, and the discomfort of much of <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>community</b> with some of his unconventional ideas.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Bethe, {{along with}} IBM {{physicist}} Richard Garwin, {{published an article}} criticising in detail the anti-ICBM defense system proposed by the Department of Defense. The two physicists described in the article that nearly any measure taken by the US would be easily thwarted with the deployment of relatively simple decoys. Bethe {{was one of the}} primary voices in <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>community</b> behind the signing of the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty prohibiting further atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|Later in {{his career}} Alvarez served on {{multiple}} high level advisory committees related to civilian and military aviation.
