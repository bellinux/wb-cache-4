5|$|Nucleic acid {{amplification}} {{tests and}} adenosine deaminase testing may allow rapid diagnosis of TB. These tests, however, are not routinely recommended, as <b>they</b> <b>rarely</b> alter {{how a person}} is treated. Blood tests to detect antibodies are not specific or sensitive, so they are not recommended.|$|E
5|$|After {{the chicks}} hatch, the birds will desert their nest. Even though the young can swim and dive during this time, <b>they</b> <b>rarely</b> do, instead {{staying on the}} parents' backs for four days after hatching. After about 10 days, the parents split the chicks up, with each parent taking care of {{about half of the}} brood. After this split, the chicks are {{independent}} in about 10 days, and fledge in about three weeks.|$|E

5|$|Applications {{are often}} {{classified}} {{according to how}} often their subtasks need to synchronize or communicate with each other. An application exhibits fine-grained parallelism if its subtasks must communicate many times per second; it exhibits coarse-grained parallelism {{if they do not}} communicate many times per second, and it exhibits embarrassing parallelism if <b>they</b> <b>rarely</b> or never have to communicate. Embarrassingly parallel applications are considered the easiest to parallelize.|$|E
5|$|Emus are diurnal {{birds and}} spend their day foraging, {{preening}} their plumage with their beak, dust bathing and resting. They are generally gregarious birds {{apart from the}} breeding season, and while some forage, others remain vigilant to their mutual benefit. They are able to swim when necessary, although <b>they</b> <b>rarely</b> do so unless the area is flooded or they need to cross a river.|$|E
5|$|Krokom Municipality {{was formed}} in 1974 and bears arms granted in 1977, {{featuring}} a ram (gumsen) based on a 6000-year-old rock carving at Glösabäcken. The ram seen here {{was included in the}} seal of the legislature of Rödön from 1658. While petroglyphs long predate heraldry, <b>they</b> <b>rarely</b> appear in heraldic armory.

5|$|Although Mex and Violeta Urtizberea are {{father and}} daughter, Violeta {{accepted}} {{a role in}} the series without knowing that her father was also part of the cast and asked him to respect her space. Although they played characters of similar ages, <b>they</b> <b>rarely</b> have joint scenes. Julieta Ortega said that she has nothing in common with her character in the series. Juan Gil Navarro, who appeared in the television drama La Dueña at the same time, said that although he does not normally appear in comedies he followed his wife's suggestion.|$|E
5|$|Coolsma {{found that}} Sundanese {{literature}} consisted predominantly of poetry, including the narrative wawacan, {{and thought that}} prose needed to be developed as well so that the people would embrace modernity. He considered that <b>they</b> <b>rarely</b> read, instead preferring to listen to more educated persons sing in verse. As such, the contents of written prose would not be conveyed. This {{is not to say}} that he disliked Sundanese poetry; he was appreciative of the dangding verse forms– derived from Javanese literary tradition– which were used to write wawacan, and considered an existing translation of the Gospel of Matthew in dangding to be the best Sundanese-language book in print.|$|E
5|$|Lesbians in Western {{cultures}} in particular often classify themselves {{as having an}} identity that defines their individual sexuality, {{as well as their}} membership to a group that shares common traits. Women in many cultures throughout history have had sexual relations with other women, but <b>they</b> <b>rarely</b> were designated as {{part of a group of}} people based on who they had physical relations with. As women have generally been political minorities in Western cultures, the added medical designation of homosexuality has been cause for the development of a subcultural identity.|$|E

5|$|The Aberdeen {{side of the}} 1970s {{regularly}} challenged {{for domestic}} honours. However, <b>they</b> <b>rarely</b> won trophies, {{with the exception of}} the Drybrough Cup in 1971 under Jimmy Bonthrone and the League Cup in 1976, under Ally MacLeod. During this decade, Aberdeen had five managers: Eddie Turnbull, Jimmy Bonthrone, Ally MacLeod, Billy McNeill and Alex Ferguson. They reached two more national cup finals—the Scottish Cup in 1978 under Billy McNeill and the League Cup in the following season under the new manager Alex Ferguson.|$|E
5|$|Within the York {{distribution}} {{the beetles}} {{are dependent on}} tansy as their sole food source; if a clump disappears the beetles are forced to walk to a new location as <b>they</b> <b>rarely</b> fly, despite having fully working wings and being capable of doing so. The loss of habitat impacts upon {{the ability of the}} tansy beetle to find an alternative source of the host plant. Additionally, tansy is a ruderal species and thus has a naturally high rate of turnover of plants, forcing beetles to regularly seek out new tansy patches to colonise.|$|E
5|$|Wolves {{are often}} infested {{with a variety}} of {{arthropod}} exoparasites, including fleas, ticks, lice, and mites. The most harmful to wolves, particularly pups, is Sarcoptes scabiei (or mange mite), though <b>they</b> <b>rarely</b> develop full blown mange, unlike foxes. Lice, such as Trichodectes canis, may cause sickness in wolves, but rarely death. Ticks of the genus Ixodes can infect wolves with Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The tick Dermacentor pictus also infests wolves. Other ectoparasites include biting lice, sucking lice and the fleas Pulex irritans and Ctenocephalides canis.|$|E

5|$|A herbivore, the bohor reedbuck prefers {{grasses and}} tender reed shoots with high protein and low fiber content. This reedbuck is {{dependent}} on water, though green pastures can fulfill its water requirement. A study of the bohor reedbuck's diet in Rwenzori Mountains National Park (Uganda) revealed that, throughout the year, the most preferred species was Sporobolus consimilis. Other grasses the animals fed on included Hyparrhenia filipendula, Heteropogon contortus and Themeda triandra, {{all of which are}} species commonly found in heavily grazed grasslands. Bohor reedbuck preferred Cynodon dactylon and Cenchrus ciliaris in the wet season, and switched to Sporobolus pyramidalis and Panicum repens in the dry season. Though <b>they</b> <b>rarely</b> feed on dicots, these can include Capparis and Sida species. On regularly burnt pastures, the bohor reedbuck feeds on Imperata species, while in places close by water sources, it eats Leersia and newly sprouted Vossia species (like topi and puku).|$|E
5|$|Although benzodiazepines {{are much}} safer in {{overdose}} than their predecessors, the barbiturates, {{they can still}} cause problems in overdose. Taken alone, <b>they</b> <b>rarely</b> cause severe complications in overdose; statistics in England showed that benzodiazepines were responsible for 3.8% of all deaths by poisoning from a single drug. However, combining these drugs with alcohol, opiates or tricyclic antidepressants markedly raises the toxicity. The elderly are {{more sensitive to the}} side effects of benzodiazepines, and poisoning may even occur from their long-term use. The various benzodiazepines differ in their toxicity; temazepam appears most toxic in overdose and when used with other drugs. The symptoms of a benzodiazepine overdose may include; drowsiness, slurred speech, nystagmus, hypotension, ataxia, coma, respiratory depression, and cardiorespiratory arrest.|$|E
5|$|Although spiders {{are widely}} feared, {{only a few}} species are {{dangerous}} to people. Spiders will only bite humans in self-defense, and few produce worse effects than a mosquito bite or bee-sting. Most of those with medically serious bites, such as recluse spiders and widow spiders, would rather flee and bite only when trapped, although this can easily arise by accident. Funnel web spiders' defensive tactics include fang display and their venom, although <b>they</b> <b>rarely</b> inject much, has resulted in 13 known human deaths over 50 years. They have been deemed to be the world's most dangerous spiders on clinical and venom toxicity grounds, though this claim has also been attributed to the Brazilian wandering spider, due to much more frequent accidents.|$|E

25|$|These {{birds are}} not often spotted. In the summer, <b>they</b> are <b>rarely</b> seen because <b>they</b> {{are in such}} an obscure {{breeding}} location. Similarly, in the winter <b>they</b> are <b>rarely</b> seen because <b>they</b> travel too far south for many birdwatchers. Therefore, the majority of sightings occur during the spring or fall in temperate regions and are generally in small numbers around water.|$|R

5|$|Formed in 1903 as {{a result}} of the {{amalgamation}} of three clubs from Aberdeen, <b>they</b> <b>rarely</b> challenged for honours until the post war decade, when they won each of the major Scottish trophies under manager Dave Halliday. This level of success was surpassed in the 1980s, when, under the management of Alex Ferguson, they won three league titles, four Scottish Cups and a Scottish League Cup, alongside the two European trophies. Aberdeen were the last club outside of the Old Firm to win a league title, in 1984–85, and also the last Scottish team to win a European trophy. The team has enjoyed less success since this golden era, though a 19-year wait for a major trophy was ended by winning the 2013–14 Scottish League Cup.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Hammond married Dorothy Lister, the {{daughter}} of a Yorkshire textile merchant, in a highly publicised ceremony at a parish church in Bingley. They met at a cricket match in 1927 but spent little time together before the wedding, having little in common. When married, <b>they</b> <b>rarely</b> communicated or got on well. Acquaintances believed Hammond treated her badly, particularly once her father lost nearly everything in the Depression, causing them financial worry. She remained loyal, but their relations gradually broke down, even after she sailed to South Africa, joining Hammond on tour in 1939 in an attempt to save the marriage. By that time, he was already seeing his future second wife, Sybil Ness-Harvey, a former beauty queen whom he had met while on tour.|$|E
5|$|In May 1942, Đurišić {{attacked}} and defeated the last significant Partisan detachment in Montenegro. In June 1942, Đurišić {{collaborated with the}} Ustaše in Foča in south-eastern Bosnia. After being forced out of Serbia by the Germans, Mihailović arrived in Montenegro as the Italians and Chetniks were fighting the Partisans. Mihailović was accompanied by his staff and a British Special Operations Executive (SOE) liaison officer. He eventually established his base {{in the village of}} Gornje Lipovo, a few miles from Đurišić's headquarters at Kolašin. Mihailović and his staff had few troops and relied on Đurišić for protection. Soon after Mihailović arrived in Montenegro, Đurišić told Mihailović's SOE liaison officer that he was available to act independently and in defiance of Mihailović. Đurišić and the other Chetnik commanders in Montenegro nominally recognised Mihailović as their supreme commander but <b>they</b> <b>rarely</b> obeyed him.|$|E
