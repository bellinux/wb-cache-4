5|$|The {{time limits}} were either ignored or {{extended}} by multiple decrees, meaning that all notes of <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> remained legal tender in practice until 21 August 2006.|$|E
5|$|A {{development}} {{in recent years}} that seeks to address <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> has been termed evidence-based medicine. As its name suggests, this approach strives to rigorously study the effects of different interventions instead of relying on logic or tradition. Jeffrey Arnold argues that its application worldwide could lead to the boon of sharing best practices between emergency medicine practitioners in various countries, thus advancing the current standard of emergency care.|$|E

5|$|After Sesame Streets first season, {{its critics}} forced its {{producers}} and researchers to address more overtly such affective goals as social competence, tolerance of diversity, and nonaggressive ways of resolving conflict. <b>These</b> <b>issues</b> were addressed through interpersonal disputes among its Street characters. During the 1980s, the show incorporated the real-life {{experiences of the}} show's cast and crew, including the death of Will Lee (Mr. Hooper) and the pregnancy of Sonia Manzano (Maria) to address affective concerns. In later seasons, Sesame Street addressed real-life disasters such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
5|$|All IQ {{tests show}} {{variation}} in scores {{even when the}} same person takes the same test over and over again. IQ scores also differ for a test-taker taking tests {{from more than one}} publisher at the same age. The various test publishers do not use uniform names or definitions for IQ score classifications. All <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> must be kept in mind when interpreting an individual's IQ scores, because they all can result in different IQ classifications for the same person at different times.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> with {{censorship}} obscured and truncated {{the film}} {{for many years}} following its release, the film was soon recognized by many western critics and film directors as a highly original and accomplished work.

Owners of the game from Steam or as a boxed retail Games For Windows Live can acquire a free Steamworks copy of the base game and purchase the new Gold Edition content. The Steamworks version did not allow the use of Nvidia's 3D Vision technology or fan modifications, though Capcom later confirmed {{a way to work}} around <b>these</b> <b>issues.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1970 these {{differences}} {{had not been}} resolved, and Brezhnev postponed the 24th Party Congress and the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1971–1975). The delay in resolving <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> led to rumours circulating in Soviet society that Kosygin, or even Brezhnev, would lose their posts to Podgorny. By March 1971 {{it became apparent that}} Brezhnev was the leader of the country, with Kosygin as the spokesman of the five-year plan and Podgorny's position within the collective leadership strengthened.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the {{comparatively}} youthful Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary in 1985, the Soviet economy was stagnant and faced a sharp fall in foreign currency earnings {{as a result of}} the downward slide in oil prices in the 1980s. <b>These</b> <b>issues</b> prompted Gorbachev to investigate measures to revive the ailing state.|$|E

40|$|Many NESB {{professionals}} {{arrive in}} Australia with little knowledge of employers' selection criteria or practices.

5|$|Due to {{its high}} speeds, large forces {{were applied to}} the {{aircraft}} during banks and turns, and caused twisting and distortion of the aircraft's structure. In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds. Both of <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and outboard elevons, varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only the innermost elevons, which {{are attached to the}} stiffest area of the wings, were active at high speed. Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed. This was visible from the rear passengers' viewpoints.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{approved}} a plan first introduced in 1992 by California's state government. The {{plan called for}} major cleanup of the lower river {{in order to protect}} salmon from phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand. It also expressed concern over high water temperatures, algal blooms, and low oxygen levels, although certain fish have adapted to some of <b>these</b> <b>issues.</b> Environmental groups, more than six government agencies, Native American tribes in the basin, and others have worked with the EPA to reduce pollution levels in the Klamath.|$|E
5|$|Issho ni A-SO-BO also {{contained}} several serious errors. Petit Ferret addressed <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> in two patches. The first patch added missing voice {{data from the}} original game CD; customers were given the option of downloading the patch or exchanging for a new CD. Ferret released the second patch on July 7, 2003; it corrected grammatical errors, adjusted the game's difficulty, and enhanced stability. The second patch did not contain the first's fixes.|$|E

5|$|Reachs {{multiplayer}} beta {{was open}} to owners of Halo 3: ODST. More than threemillion copies of ODST were sold by November 2009. Bungie estimated between two and three million players for the upcoming Reach beta, compared to the 800,000 that participated in Halo 3s trial. Development schedules forced Bungie to release a six-week-old beta, fraught with bugs and issues already addressed in newer builds. Though concerned that <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> might tarnish the game's image, Jarrard noted that they {{had little choice but}} to ship it as it was and communicate with players concerning the fixes.|$|E
5|$|Several critics {{detect a}} crisis in public {{memorial}} style from 1945, when the traditional figurative symbolic language, and evocation of nationalist values, came to seem inadequate, especially in relation to genocide, {{at least on the}} Western side of the Iron Curtain. In the Communist East the established style of Socialist Realism was still considered appropriate, at least by the authorities. The generation of abstracted and conceptual war and Holocaust memorials erected in the West from the 1990s onwards seems finally to have found a resolution for <b>these</b> <b>issues.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{key issues}} are {{routinely}} raised by musicians and music scholars, when discussing {{the performance of}} Schubert's compositions for piano.
