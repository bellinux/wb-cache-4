25|$|Here's {{the deal}} these days: <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> who we are. <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> where we live. We've {{got a few}} secrets left, and we're gonna use them. But just know that the end is coming. And we don't know how much longer we can do this. How much longer can we fight.|$|E
25|$|The crucial {{aspect of}} any good pass is it being {{difficult}} to intercept. Good passers can pass {{the ball with}} great accuracy and <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> where each of their other teammates prefers to receive the ball. A special way of doing this is passing the ball without looking at the receiving teammate. This is called a no-look pass.|$|E
25|$|Four newly raised ranging companies, {{have all}} been organized, and taken their several {{stations}} on our frontier. We are much pleased. We know they are true men, and <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> what they are about. With many of them Indian and Mexican fighting has been their trade for years. That they may be permanently retained in the service on our frontier is extremely desirable, and we cannot permit ourselves to doubt such will be the case.|$|E
60|$|He {{gave them}} some further instructions, and {{half an hour}} had slipped by before he seemed {{satisfied}} that <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what <b>they</b> were to do; then he nodded.|$|R
60|$|Any one, however, could {{understand}} how a telegraphic wire was put up. And what was more, {{quite a number of}} persons thought <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> how it ought to be put up, and made no scruple of saying so.|$|R
60|$|Harry and Jerry {{had studied}} {{up all the}} {{newspaper}} reports concerning the race between the Defender, a splendid yacht from the Poplar River, and the Spray, a craft from up the lake, and <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> where to go {{in order to see}} the race to the best advantage.|$|R
2500|$|Ideally, all {{employees}} {{of a firm}} would have one-on-one communication with each other so <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> what the other workers are doing. A firm with a single worker does not require any communication between employees. A firm with two workers requires one communication channel, directly between those two workers. A firm with three workers requires three communication channels between employees (between employees A & B, B & C, and A & C). Here is a chart of one-on-one communication channels required: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hard to say. Fairly good. They're organized. <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> what they're doing. Once {{they start}} they go like {{a horde of}} locusts. They have to keep moving, and fast. It's secrecy and speed they depend on. Surprise. They push their way in before anyone has any idea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you my impressions, sir," [...] the latter continued. [...] "The ignorance {{displayed}} in the German newspapers about England is entirely a matter of censorship. Their actual information as regards every detail of our military condition is simply amazing. <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> what munitions are reaching our shores from abroad, they know how we are paying for them, <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> our financial condition, they know all about our new guns, they know just how many men we could send over to France to-morrow and how many we could get through in three months' time. They know the private views of {{every one of the}} Cabinet Ministers. They knew in Berlin yesterday what took place at the Cabinet Council the day before. You must realise yourself that some of this is true. How does the information get through?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't {{remember}} that I have," [...] he replied. [...] "They've been awfully clever, those fellows, though. The last few nights before our little scrap <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what time our relief parties came along. Several times {{we changed the}} hour. No use! They were on to us just the same." ...|$|R
60|$|Once safe, {{the boys}} placed the {{stranger}} {{on the grass}} and started to work over him. He was unconscious, and had evidently swallowed considerable water. Fortunately, the lads had taken lessons in how to resuscitate a person who had been close to drowning, so <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what to do.|$|R
5000|$|The {{experience}} in the tunnel has been chronicled in numerous videos posted on YouTube, and in detailed accounts by The Huffington Post. <b>They</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> how many ticket holders there were. <b>They</b> <b>knew</b> people would show up early in massive numbers. They had months to prepare ... And their planning was clearly woefully inadequate and put thousands of people at risk of injury.|$|R
6000|$|When {{the storm}} began to brew that night, George Welton, the mate of the {{floating}} light, walked {{the deck of}} his boiled-lobster-like vessel, and examined the sky and sea with that critical expression peculiar to seafaring men, which conveys to landsmen the reassuring impression that <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> what is coming, precisely {{what ought to be}} done, and certainly what will be the result of whatever happens! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We may expect 'em any time, now," [...] {{the hunter}} answered. [...] "The Injuns' time of attack is {{generally}} just before dawn, {{but they know}} well enough they aint likely to ketch us asleep any time, and, as <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> what {{they have got to}} do they'll gain nothing by waiting. I wish we had a moon; if we had, we might keep 'em out of the stockade. But there--it's just as well it's dark, after all; for, if the moon was up, the young ones would have no chance of getting away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Ned, you {{certainly}} have deserved success, and I am indeed obliged {{to you for}} the immense trouble you have taken over the matter. It is too bad your spending your time over this annoying affair, when you are only home on a year's leave. What you have learned is, of course, no direct proof that Truscott has a hand in this affair; at the same time, what he said confirms to some extent your suspicions of him. Would it not be as well to put the search for him {{into the hands of}} a detective, now that there is some one definite to search for? One of these men might be useful, and I really would vastly rather employ one than know that you are spending day after day searching for him yourself. These men are accustomed to the work; <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> the persons to whom to apply; they have agents under them, who know infinitely better the sort of place where such a fellow would be likely to take up his quarters than you can do.' ...|$|E
60|$|The Rover {{boys were}} {{so used to}} {{traveling}} and to camping out that <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what to take along. The other lads were also well informed, because of the military encampments {{in which they had}} participated. They carried only what was necessary, so that their steeds might not be too heavily burdened.|$|R
60|$|Both of {{the youths}} had been camping so often that <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what to do. The fire was stirred up, and fresh wood put on, and they {{prepared}} a couple of cups of coffee, and broiled two squirrels. They had bread and crackers, and a little cheese, and thus made quite a good breakfast.|$|R
60|$|Their {{previous}} experience in camping out stood the six cadets in good stead, and <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> how {{to leave their}} fire {{so that it would}} keep burning until morning without doing any damage. Then, one after another, they speedily shoved off to bed and soon all of them were slumbering peacefully after a long and arduous day's traveling.|$|R
6000|$|The Chinns are luckier {{than most}} folk, because <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> {{what they must}} do. A clever Chinn passes for the Bombay Civil Service, and gets away to Central India, where {{everybody}} is glad to see him. A dull Chinn enters the Police Department or the Woods and Forest, {{and sooner or later}} he, too, appears in Central India, and that is what gave rise to the saying, [...] "Central India is inhabited by Bhils, Mairs, and Chinns, all very much alike." [...] The breed is small-boned, dark, and silent, and the stupidest of them are good shots. John Chinn the Second was rather clever, but as the eldest son he entered the army, according to Chinn tradition. His duty was to abide in his father's regiment for the term of his natural life, though the corps was one which most men would have paid heavily to avoid. They were irregulars, small, dark, and blackish, clothed in rifle-green with black-leather trimmings; and friends called them the [...] "Wuddars," [...] which means a race of low-caste people who dig up rats to eat. But the Wuddars did not resent it. They were the only Wuddars, and their points of pride were these: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Miss Morland," [...] said Henry, [...] "in this amiable solicitude {{for your}} brother's comfort, may you {{not be a}} little mistaken? Are you not carried a little too far? Would he thank you, either on his own account or Miss Thorpe's, for supposing that her affection, or at least her good behaviour, is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain Tilney? Is he safe only in solitude? Or is her heart {{constant}} to him only when unsolicited by anyone else? He cannot think this--and you may be sure {{that he would not}} have you think it. I will not say, 'Do not be uneasy,' because I know that you are so, at this moment; but be as little uneasy as you can. You have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend; depend upon it, therefore, that real jealousy never can exist between them; depend upon it that no disagreement between them can be of any duration. Their hearts are open to each other, as neither heart can be to you; <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> what is required and what can be borne; and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant." ...|$|E
6000|$|In the main, then, {{the doctor}} learns {{that if he}} gets ahead of the superstitions of his {{patients}} he is a ruined man; {{and the result is}} that he instinctively takes care not to get ahead of them. That is why all the changes come from the laity. It was not until an agitation had been conducted for many years by laymen, including quacks and faddists of all kinds, that the public was sufficiently impressed {{to make it possible for}} the doctors to open their minds and their mouths on the subject of fresh air, cold water, temperance, and the rest of the new fashions in hygiene. At present the tables have been turned on many old prejudices. Plenty of our most popular elderly doctors believe that cold tubs in the morning are unnatural, exhausting, and rheumatic; that fresh air is a fad and that everybody is the better for a glass or two of port wine every day; but they no longer dare say as much until <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> where they are; for many very desirable patients in country houses have lately been persuaded that their first duty is to get up at six in the morning and begin the day by taking a walk barefoot through the dewy grass. He who shows the least scepticism as to this practice is at once suspected of being [...] "an old-fashioned doctor," [...] and dismissed to make room for a younger man.|$|E
60|$|Both he, {{as well as}} <b>they,</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what to do {{for this}} {{outgrowth}} of carelessness, and pail after pail of water was dashed on to {{the hub of the}} wheel to cool it off, even while he was yet repeating his offer to loan them one of his wagons if they were in a hurry to be on their journey again.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Byram {{left the}} room to deliver the message, and Bill delayed his {{partners}} that <b>they</b> might <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> how he felt regarding the matter before starting on the journey.|$|R
60|$|Toby's {{heart beat}} fast and furious, and he {{expected}} every moment {{to hear them}} at the door, demanding admittance, for {{it seemed to him}} that <b>they</b> must <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> where he was secreted.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have to {{go through}} with it, but it's a hell of utterly inglorious squabbling. They bait me. They have been {{fighting}} the same fight within themselves that they fight with me. <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> where I am, that I too am doing my job against internal friction. The one thing before all others that {{they want to do is}} to bring me down off my moral high horse. And I loathe the high horse. I am in a position of special moral superiority to men who are on the whole as good men as I am or better. That shows all the time. You see the sort of man I am. I've a broad streak of personal vanity. I fag easily. I'm short-tempered. I've other things, as you perceive. When I fag I become obtuse, I repeat and bore, I get viciously ill-tempered, I suffer from an intolerable sense of ill usage. Then that ass, Wagstaffe, who ought to be working with me steadily, sees his chance to be pleasantly witty. He gets a laugh round the table at my expense. Young Dent, the more intelligent of the labour men, reads me a lecture in committee manners. Old Cassidy sees HIS opening and jabs some ridiculous petty accusation at me and gets me spluttering self-defence like a fool. All my stock goes down, and as my stock goes down the chances of a good report dwindle. Young Dent grieves to see me injuring my own case. Too damned a fool to see what will happen to the report! You see if only they can convince themselves I am just a prig and an egotist and an impractical bore, they escape from a great deal more than my poor propositions. They escape from the doubt in themselves. By dismissing me they dismiss their own consciences. And then they can scamper off and be sensible little piggy-wigs and not bother any more about what is to happen to mankind in the long run.... Do you begin to realize the sort of fight, upside down in a dustbin, that that Committee is for me?" ...|$|E

50|$|Francisco Barreto de Meneses, the Portuguese {{commander}} (Mestre-de-Campo-General) {{had recently}} arrived to that region {{and decided to}} follow his subordinate's suggestions: {{they would go to}} their enemy instead, and force the Dutch troops into a decisive encounter. This was a bold move, considering they were in half the numbers of their adversaries, and had no artillery. At this point, information sent from the fallen Barreta outpost had come to them, and <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> the size and equipment available to the Dutch forces.|$|R
5000|$|... “Twenty-three Jap {{planes in}} {{formations}} of three, {{four and five}} appeared at 1750, coming {{from the south and}} west. They circled the mountains and attacked Dutch Harbor. The Japs used dive-bombing tactics against what seemed to be pre-determined targets. They split up as if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> where <b>they</b> were going, picking such targets as the oil tanks, the 3" [...] guns, the dock and [...] "hotel ship," [...] the Northwestern. They bombed Dutch Harbor for about an hour.” - Gus G. Stravos ...|$|R
25|$|It is {{probably}} {{fair to say}} that nobody could have completely filled Wingate's shoes. Wingate had sustained his force outside normal army command through political connections that no successor would have available. The other dilemma of any successor was that they would constantly be second-guessed by those who thought <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what Wingate would have done in a particular situation. The same officers who would go to extraordinary lengths to justify even the most flawed decisions by Wingate, would attack any successor, whenever the opportunity presented itself.|$|R
5000|$|... "Too Far Gone" [...] {{was written}} in {{response}} to then-Prime Minister Tony Blair's plans to introduce ID cards in the UK. In Neeson's opinion, [...] "they might as well attach tracking devices on to everybody so <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> where everybody's going at every moment of the day." ...|$|E

5000|$|Player- vs. Character-Knowledge: Since Cass, Gary and Leo {{have played}} the {{campaign}} twice already, <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> {{what to do and}} where to go, but their new characters can't have this information. Another time they find Nodwick, the henchman of their old group, and instantly recognize him, although their new characters meet him for the first time.|$|E
5000|$|On Sunday, May 8, 1988, two gunmen wearing ski masks {{entered the}} cartoonist's home through an {{unlocked}} door, planning to kidnap Jean Schulz, but the attempt failed when Schulz's daughter Jill {{drove up to}} the house, prompting the would-be kidnappers to flee. She saw what was happening and called the police from a neighbor's house. Sonoma County Sheriff Dick Michaelsen said, [...] "It was obviously an attempted kidnap-ransom. This was a targeted criminal act. <b>They</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> who the victims were." [...] Neither Schulz nor his wife was hurt during the incident.|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} Marion Raven said their songs were always {{about their experiences}} and thoughts, and that this album's songs were [...] "mostly about love," [...] though also touched on jealousy and how they see the world. She also said that while their first album was about finding out who they were as everything about recording was new to them, on The Big Room <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what <b>they</b> wanted, stating [...] "We {{wanted to make a}} 'real' album. With a live band in the studio, with our songs and a producer we knew would listen to our ideas." ...|$|R
