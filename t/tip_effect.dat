40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} {{interaction}} between an AFM probe and a liquid film deposited over a flat substrate. We investigate {{the effects of the}} physical and geometrical parameters, with a special focus on the film thickness E, the probe radius R, and the distance D between the probe and the free surface. Deformation profiles have been calculated from the numerical simulations of the Young-Laplace equation by taking into account the probe/liquid and the liquid/substrate interactions, characterized by the Hamaker constants, Hpl and Hls. We demonstrate that the deformation of a shallow film is determined by a particular characteristic length λF = (2 πγE 4 /Hls) 1 / 2, resulting from the balance between the capillary force (γ is the surface tension) and the van der Waals liquid/substrate attraction. For the case of a bulk liquid, the extent of the interface deformation is simply controlled by the capillary length λC = (γ/Δρg) 1 / 2. These trends point out two asymptotic regimes, which in turn are bounded by two characteristic film thicknesses Eg = (Hls/ 2 πΔρg) 1 / 4 and Eγ = (R 2 Hls/ 2 πγ) 1 / 4. For E > Eg, the bulk behavior is recovered, and for E < Eγ, we show the existence of a particular shallow film regime in which a localized <b>tip</b> <b>effect</b> is observed. This <b>tip</b> <b>effect</b> is characterized by the small magnitude of the deformation and an important restriction of its radial extent λF localized below the probe. In addition, we have found that the film thickness has a significant effect on the threshold separation distance Dmin below which the irreversible jumpto- contact process occurs: Dmin is probe radius-dependent for the bulk whereas it is film-thickness-dependent for shallow films. These results have an important impact on the optimal AFM scanning conditions...|$|E

30|$|It {{should be}} pointed out that the AFM tip is going to be {{contaminated}} at the first touch and continue with the following touches, and this contamination can influence the next interaction of the tip with the cells. Therefore, contamination control of AFM tips is very important for reliable AFM imaging and surface/interface force measurements. Most contaminants may result in poor imaging quality either by causing <b>tip</b> <b>effects</b> and/or noise [32]. <b>Tip</b> <b>effects</b> reflect the increase in tip size as the contaminants add to the tip apex [33]. A noisy AFM image can be a result of uncontrollable interaction (such as sudden bridging or breaking) between the tip and the sample surface mediated by interspersed sticky contaminants. Nie et al. considered that such a contaminant confined on the tip apex displays an uncontrollable variation in the oscillation amplitude of the cantilever, causing noise in the AFM images the contaminated tip collects, but such a contaminant may be removed from the apex by pushing the tip into a material soft enough to avoid damage to the tip [34]. According to our experience, cell samples should be gently washed with the buffer at least three times for removing debris attachment from cell culture media and themselves before AFM determination. We think that a contact mode for the determination may be replaced by a tapping mode in order to reduce the contamination and cell damage if serious contamination occurs. Actually, traditional cleaning methods for the tip, including plasma, UV-ozone, solvent treatments, and so on, have been abroad applied, but there still are some shortcomings. Recently, Gan et al. reported that calibration gratings with supersharp spikes could be employed to scrub away contaminants accumulated on a colloidal sphere probe by scanning the probe against the spikes at high load at constant-force mode. This method may be superior to traditional cleaning methods in several aspects [35]. Anyway, control of AFM tip contamination is an extremely common issue and remains to be further studied.|$|R
