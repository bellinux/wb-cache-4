5|$|Financial aid and {{incentives}} did not deliver <b>the</b> <b>expected</b> <b>results</b> for the hajduks, {{as they did}} not wish to settle in the assigned lands. Conflicts ensued between the hajduks and local people in Puljština, with kidnappings, hajduk attacks on fishermen and boats, and also revenge killings. The hajduks were enraged, and could not cope with the Istrian climate. Many of them moved to Senj, where the Uskoks were still active. During this time, Pivljanin and Njegošević were the most active in moving hajduks into the Habsburg Monarchy, and they travelled to Karlovac to negotiate. Some hajduks independently returned to the Bay of Kotor, where the provveditore of Kotor put some on galleys, imprisoned some at Klis, and exiled some, after killing others using old convictions as a pretext. When harambaša Njegošević was persecuted, the hajduks again sent Pivljanin to Venice as their envoy. In his plea to the Doge of Venice, dated 27March 1673, Pivljanin asked that the persecution of hajduks cease, stating that they had all been pardoned by an amnesty issued by Barbaro. The request was partly met, and some hajduks were freed.|$|E

25|$|When {{two people}} look at two {{different}} detectors that scan entangled particles, both observers will enter an indefinite state, as with one observer. These results need not agree – the second observer's mind {{does not have to}} have results that correlate with the first's. When one observer tells the results to the second observer, their two minds cannot communicate and thus will only interact with the other's body, which is still indefinite. When the second observer responds, its body will respond with whatever result agrees with the first observer's mind. This means that both observer's minds will be in a state of the wavefunction that always get <b>the</b> <b>expected</b> <b>results,</b> but individually their results could be different.|$|E
25|$|Now {{expand the}} {{situation}} to have one sentient being observing the device. Now, they too enter the indefinite state. Their eyes, body, and brain are seeing both spins at the same time. The mind however, stochastically chooses one of the directions, {{and that is what}} the mind sees. When this observer goes over to the second detector, their body will see both results. Their mind will choose the result that agrees with the first detector, and the observer will see <b>the</b> <b>expected</b> <b>results.</b> However, the observers mind seeing one result does not directly affect the distant state - there is just no wave function in which the expected correlations do not exist. The true correlation only happens when they actually go over to the second detector.|$|E

In spite of that, a number of start-up companies active in the field of fusion power have managed to attract private money.|$|E

Pressured by the joint Army-Christian militias' counter-offensive, Kulaylat called the PLO for help and received it. [...] The Phoenicia and St Georges Hotels changed hands {{several times during the}} night. Nevertheless, the Muslim militiamen were able to storm and secure the disputed Phoenicia Inter-Continental Hotel, and the next day they mounted another assault against Christian militia' and ISF Gendarmerie positions. While the Christian militiamen repulsed the attacks on their own positions, the Gendarmes' avoided confrontation and withdrew to the unfinished Beirut Hilton Hotel. The Al-Mourabitoun were forced out from the St Georges and Alcazar Hotels after a heavy artillery bombardment by the Lebanese Army, supported by the Phalangists. Fighting came to a temporary near-halt on December 12 when the exhausted combatants of both sides realised that they had more or less retained their original positions.|$|E
60|$|So {{it was in}} 1882. Tenants were {{harassed by}} needy landlords, {{and when they were}} served with forms of {{ejectment}} the landlords were simply murdered, either in their own persons or in that of their servants. Men finding their power, and beginning to learn how much might be exacted from a yielding Government, hardly knew how to moderate their aspirations. When they found that <b>the</b> <b>expected</b> <b>results</b> did not come at once, they resorted to revenge. Why should these tyrants keep them out from the good things which their American friends had promised them, and which were so close within their grasp? And their anger turned not only against their landlords, but against those who might seem in any way to be fighting on the landlords' side. Did a neighbour occupy a field from which a Landleaguing tenant had been evicted, let the tails of that neighbour's cattle be cut off, or the legs broken of his beasts of burden, or his sheep have their throats cut. Or if the injured one have some scruples of conscience, let the oppressor simply be boycotted, and put out of all intercourse with his brother men. Let no well-intentioned Landleaguing neighbour buy from him a ton of hay, or sell to him a loaf of bread.|$|E

40|$|Functional {{testing of}} a query {{language}} is a challenging task in practice. In order to reveal errors in the query processing functionality, {{it is necessary to}} verify the actual result of a test query with <b>the</b> <b>expected</b> correct <b>result.</b> However, automatically computing <b>the</b> <b>expected</b> query <b>result</b> of an arbitrary test query is not trivial. One solution is to first generate a set of test database instances as well as test queries and then to compute <b>the</b> <b>expected</b> <b>result</b> for each test query over the individual test database instances just like in forward query processing. The problem of this solution is, that many test queries might return an empty query result which is not interesting for the functional testing of a query language. In this paper, we present a new approach which provides a different solution to the verification of the actual result of a test query. Instead of first generating the database instance and then computing <b>the</b> <b>expected</b> <b>result</b> for each test query, we first create one or more interesting <b>expected</b> <b>results</b> for a given test query and then generate a test database instance for each combination of a test query and an <b>expected</b> <b>result</b> individually which returns <b>the</b> <b>expected</b> <b>result</b> if <b>the</b> test query is executed correctly. In this way, we enable the verification of the actual result and allow an explicit definition of interesting test cases for the functional testing of a query language. As a concrete result, this paper discusses the implementation of this approach for the query language Entity SQL of the new ADO. Net Entity Framework. 1...|$|R
