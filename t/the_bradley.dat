5|$|The Milwaukee Bucks are an American {{professional}} basketball franchise based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They are {{a member of}} the Central Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team has played their home games at <b>the</b> <b>Bradley</b> Center since 1988. The Bucks are owned by Herb Kohl, with John Hammond as their general manager.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Copeland {{received}} {{far more}} personal attention from <b>the</b> <b>Bradley</b> family than {{her mother could}} give each of her six children. Raised in a lapsed Christian household, when Copeland lived with <b>the</b> <b>Bradley</b> family, she attended their synagogue and celebrated Shabbat with them, enjoying their family's closeness. In addition to Bradley's intensive ballet training, her husband, a modern-dance teacher, served as Copeland's pas-de-deux instructor and partner. The summer before her fifteenth birthday, Bradley began to homeschool Copeland for 10th grade to free up more time for dance. At fifteen years old, Copeland won {{first place in the}} Los Angeles Music Center Spotlight Awards at the Chandler Pavilion in March 1998. Copeland said {{it was the first time}} she ever battled nervousness. The winners received scholarships between $500 and $2500. Copeland's victory in the 10th annual contest among gifted high school students in Southern California secured her recognition by the Los Angeles Times as the best young dancer in the Greater Los Angeles Area.|$|E
5|$|On 29 July 2013, Army Chief of Staff General Ray Odierno {{warned that}} the Ground Combat Vehicle program might be delayed or {{possibly}} even cancelled because of the sequestration budget cuts. Although he specifically said it could be delayed, he did {{not rule out the}} possibility of cancellation. The GCV was high-priority for the Army to give better protection than the M2 Bradley, but because of the sequester cuts everything was being considered. On 1 August 2013, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel outlined two basic results if the effects of sequestration continued: modernization programs like the GCV would be cut to maintain troop levels, or high-end capability efforts like the GCV would be preserved to continue modernization and keep equipment technologically advanced with troop levels being cut. Odierno was committed to balancing soldiers, readiness, and modernization, and was intent on the need for the Ground Combat Vehicle. Suggested alternative options, such as further upgrading <b>the</b> <b>Bradley</b> and buying currently available infantry fighting vehicles like the German Puma, were recommended as cost-saving measures. Army leaders said the Puma's low troop-carrying capacity would require buying five vehicles to replace every four Bradleys, and that upgrading <b>the</b> <b>Bradley</b> would essentially be engineering a new vehicle. While these options would offer no improvement over the fleet's current capability, not pursuing the GCV would allow the money to be spent elsewhere.|$|E
5000|$|Buddy Bradley first {{appeared}} {{with the rest}} of <b>the</b> <b>Bradleys</b> in Bagge's short-lived early 1980s publication with John Holmstrom and J. D. King, Comical Funnies. <b>The</b> <b>Bradleys</b> family was based on Bagge's own, with Buddy being the character he most identified with. He recognised [...] "what a great vehicle <b>the</b> <b>Bradley's</b> oldest son, Buddy, served as a way of re-telling stories from my own distant- and all too vivid - past." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bradleys</b> - a spoof {{soap opera}} {{featuring}} a dysfunctional family, apparently based on Bagge's own family. Brad <b>Bradley,</b> <b>the</b> father, is an overweight, perpetually complaining slob and Betty <b>Bradley,</b> <b>the</b> mother, is a God-fearing, occasionally foul-tempered 'woman of the eighties', whilst their children, Butch (a gullible, war-mad pre-teen), Babs (a plain, self-absorbed teenage girl with retainers on her teeth) and Buddy (a retro music-loving slacker) alternate between {{fighting each other}} and their own parents. Bagge would continue with these characters and story line in his later title Hate. After the popularity of Hate, <b>the</b> <b>Bradleys</b> stories from Neat Stuff would be collected and reprinted in their own comic mini-series entitled <b>The</b> <b>Bradleys.</b>|$|R

Turning in a more south westerly direction the river enters Oldbury Court estate, a city park also known as Vassal's, past Snuff Mills, entering a steep valley at Stapleton, then passing Eastville park, where it feeds the former boating lake and is met by the Fishponds brook on the right.|$|E
5|$|Copeland {{attended}} the summer workshop at the San Francisco Ballet School in 1998. She and Bradley selected the workshop over offers from the Joffrey Ballet, ABT and Dance Theater of Harlem, among others. Of the programs she auditioned for, only New York City Ballet declined {{to make her}} an offer. San Francisco Ballet, ABT and New York City Ballet are regarded as the three preeminent classical ballet companies in the US. During the six-week workshop at San Francisco, Copeland {{was placed in the}} most advanced classes and was under a full tuition plus expenses scholarship. At the end of the workshop, she received one of the few offers to continue as a full-time student at the school. She declined the offer because of the encouragement from her mother to return home, the prospect of continuing personal training from <b>the</b> <b>Bradley</b> family and dreams of a subsequent summer with ABT.|$|E

In the two games at <b>the</b> <b>Bradley</b> Center against Wofford and Texas, Robinson scored 14 points in each game and {{averaged}} 6 rebounds. In the Sweet Sixteen round, he opposed his father's former Purdue roommate and Tennessee head coach Cuonzo Martin. Robinson scored 13 points as Michigan again advanced in the tournament. The 2013â€“14 team was eliminated in the elite eight round of the NCAA Tournament by Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|Politics was a {{frequent}} subject of discussion in <b>the</b> <b>Bradley</b> household, {{and some of his}} relatives held local and county political offices. He majored in history at Princeton, and was present in the Senate chamber when the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed. Van Breda Kolff and many others who knew him predicted that Bradley would be Governor of Missouri, or President, by 40. He spent his time at Oxford focusing on European political and economic history. In 1978, he said that congressman Mo Udall, himself a former professional basketball player, had told him ten years earlier that professional sports could help prepare him for politics, depending on what he did with his non-playing time.|$|E
5|$|Taboo Tuesday (2004) was a {{professional}} wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and presented by AT which took place on October 19, 2004 at <b>the</b> <b>Bradley</b> Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It was the first annual Taboo Tuesday event, marking {{the first time in}} which the fans were given the chance to vote on stipulations for the matches. The voting for the event started on October 18, 2004 and ended during the event. Eight professional wrestling matches were featured on the event's card. The buildup to the matches and the scenarios that took place before, during, and after the event were planned by WWE's script writers. The event starred wrestlers from the Raw brand: a storyline expansion of the promotion where employees are assigned to a wrestling brand under the WWE banner.|$|E
5|$|The Army {{was using}} an {{incremental}} approach to combat vehicle modernization, {{centered on the}} Ground Combat Vehicle. The deployment was to be synchronized with upgrades, reset, and divestiture of existing vehicles. Vehicles displaced by the IFV may then replace selected M113 family of vehicles such as command and control, medical evacuation, and mortar carrier, allowing the Army to begin divestiture of the M113 family of vehicles. Upgrades to existing Bradley and Stryker vehicles may have been considered as risk mitigation based on {{the rate at which}} the GCV was introduced. Although upgraded, <b>the</b> <b>Bradley</b> and Stryker would also be replaced in the midterm.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bradley</b> Center had {{a maximum}} {{capacity}} of 18,000, which was reduced for the event. This event grossed over $215,000 from an approximate attendance of 3,500. It also received 174,000 pay-per-view buys. Taboo Tuesday helped World Wrestling Entertainment earn $24.7million in revenue from pay-per-view events versus $18.5million the previous year, which was later confirmed by Linda McMahon on November 23, 2004 in a quarterly result. Canadian Online Explorer's professional wrestling section rated the event 5 out of 10 stars. The rating {{was lower than}} the Taboo Tuesday event in 2005, which was rated 7 out of 10 stars. The Steel cage match was rated a ten of ten stars. The Lingerie Pillow Fight match was rated zero out of 10 stars.|$|E
5|$|The GCV {{must have}} been {{transportable}} by cargo aircraft, rail, and ship. The Army required it to meet the availability rates of the current Stryker. The Army did not limit the vehicle by {{the dimensions of the}} C-130 Hercules, which, in the past, constrained many designs. Air mobility would be provided by the more spacious C-17 Globemaster III. The GCV was to have good cross-country mobility, with a baseline requirement of 30mph off-road speed. The GCV should have delivered higher sustainability levels and consume less fuel than <b>the</b> <b>Bradley</b> or other vehicles of similar weight and power. The military was accepting both tracked and wheeled designs. The operational maintenance cost requirement of the GCV was up to $200 per mile, compared to $168 per mile for the M2 Bradley.|$|E
5|$|Potential Republican gubernatorial {{candidates}} were initially few. Some saw Kentucky's 18,000-vote plurality for William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 presidential election as {{a sure sign}} that the state would vote Democratic in 1899. Others were not interested in being on the defense against the inevitable Democratic attacks on <b>the</b> <b>Bradley</b> administration. Still others were intimidated by the prospect of being defeated by the machinery of the Goebel Election Law. Party leaders were encouraged, however, by the deep Democratic divisions at the Music Hall Convention. Sitting attorney general William S. Taylor was the first to announce his candidacy and soon secured the support of Republican senator William Deboe. Later candidates included Hopkins County judge Clifton J. Pratt and sitting state Auditor Sam H. Stone. The former was the choice of Governor Bradley, while the latter was supported by Lexington Herald editor Sam J. Roberts. Taylor, like Goebel, was a skilled political organizer. He was able to create a strong political machine amongst the county delegations and seemed the favorite to win the nomination.|$|E

5|$|Copeland {{returned}} to her mother's home and frequent arguments. Her mother had long resented the Bradleys' influence and soon decided that Copeland would cease study with <b>the</b> <b>Bradleys.</b> Copeland was distraught with fear {{that she would not}} be able to dance. She had heard the term emancipation while in San Francisco; the procedure was common among young performers to secure their financial and residential independence. <b>The</b> <b>Bradleys</b> introduced Copeland to Steven Bartell, a lawyer who explained the emancipation petition process. <b>The</b> <b>Bradleys</b> encouraged her to be absent from home when the emancipation petition was delivered to her mother. Copeland ran away from home for three days and stayed with a friend, while Bartell filed the emancipation papers. After her mother reported Copeland missing, she was told about the emancipation petition. Three days after running away, Copeland was {{returned to}} her mother by the police. DelaCerna engaged lawyer Gloria Allred and applied for a series of restraining orders, which included the Bradleys' five-year-old son, who had been Copeland's roommate, and Bartell. The order was partly intended to preclude contact between <b>the</b> <b>Bradleys</b> and Copeland, but it did not have proper legal basis, since there had been no stalking and no harassment.|$|R
