40|$|University <b>timetabling</b> is an NP-hard problem, {{which means}} that the amount of {{computation}} required to find solutions increases exponentially with problem size. <b>Timetabling</b> is subject to hard constraints that must be satisfied in order to produce feasible <b>timetables</b> and soft constraints, which are not absolutely essential. This paper describes the Stochastic Optimisation <b>Timetabling</b> Tool (SOTT) that has been developed for university course <b>timetabling.</b> Genetic Algorithms (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA) and random search are embedded in the SOTT. The algorithms include a repair process, which ensures that all infeasible <b>timetables</b> are rectified. This prevents clashes and ensures that the rooms are sufficiently large to accommodate the classes. The algorithms also evaluate <b>timetables</b> in terms of soft constraints: minimising student movement; avoiding fragmentation in the <b>timetables</b> for students and lecturers; and satisfying lecturers' preferences for the timing of classes. The algorithms were tested using two sets of <b>timetabling</b> data from a collaborating university. Both GA and SA produced very good <b>timetables,</b> but the results obtained from SA were slightly better than those using GA. However, the GA was 54 % faster than SA. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to give a brief {{introduction}} to some recent approaches to <b>timetabling</b> problems that have been developed or are under development in the Automated Scheduling, Optimisation and Planning Research Group (ASAP) at the University of Nottingham. We have concentrated upon university <b>timetabling</b> but we believe that some of the methodologies that are described can be used for different <b>timetabling</b> problems such as employee <b>timetabling,</b> <b>timetabling</b> of sports fixtures, etc. The paper suggests a number of approaches and comprises three parts. Firstly, recent heuristic and evolutionary <b>timetabling</b> algorithms are discussed. In particular, two evolutionary algorithm developments are described: a method for decomposing large real-world <b>timetabling</b> problems and a method for heuristic initialisation of the population. Secondly, an approach that considers <b>timetabling</b> problems as multicriteria decision problems is presented. Thirdly, we discuss a case-based reasoning approach that employs previous experience to solve new <b>timetabling</b> problems. Finally, we outline some new research ideas and directions in the field of <b>timetabling.</b> The overall aim of these research directions is to explore approaches that can operate at a higher level of generality than is currently possible.

40|$|The {{university}} course <b>timetabling</b> problem involves {{the assignment of}} instructors, courses, and course sections to meeting rooms, dates, and times. <b>Timetabling</b> research has generally focused on the algorithms and techniques for solving specific scheduling problems.

CourseML addressed the need for a standardized <b>timetabling</b> language to facilitate the efficient exchange of <b>timetabling</b> data and provided a means for the independent evaluation and comparison of time tabling problems and solutions. A sample real-world university course <b>timetabling</b> problem was defined. CourseML was used to define the sample problem. CourseML was evaluated based on how well it captured the sample problem, including hard and soft constraints, and how well it represented a solution instance.

30|$|<b>Timetabling</b> is {{a common}} problem of {{educational}} institutions, e.g., schools and universities. It {{can be divided into}} three categories.

The third one is examination <b>timetabling</b> which schedules the examinations of given courses. Examination <b>timetabling</b> is a hard, complex, and time-consuming task.
