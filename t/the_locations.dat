5|$|Before play begins, the Dungeon Master (or DM, {{the player}} who organizes and directs the game play) {{randomly}} draws five cards from a deck of six. Two of these cards determine <b>the</b> <b>locations</b> of two magical weapons useful in defeating Strahd: the Holy Symbol and the Sunsword. The next two cards determine <b>the</b> <b>locations</b> of Strahd and the Tome of Strahd, a book that details Strahd's long-ago unrequited love. In this work, it is revealed that Strahd {{had fallen in love}} with a young girl, who in turn loved his younger brother. Strahd blamed his age for the rejection, and made a pact with evil powers to live forever. He then slew his brother, but the young girl killed herself in response, and Strahd found that he had become a vampire. All six possible locations are inside Castle Ravenloft.|$|E

5|$|Legends {{describing}} Cofresí as malevolent generally link him to supernatural elements {{acquired through}} witchcraft, mysticism or {{a deal with}} the Devil. This horror fiction emphasizes his ruthlessness while alive or his unwillingness to remain dead. Cofresí's ghost has a fiery aura or extraordinary powers of manifestation, defending <b>the</b> <b>locations</b> of his hidden treasure or roaming aimlessly. Cofresí has been vilified by merchants. Legends portraying him as benign figure are more prevalent near Cabo Rojo; in other areas of Puerto Rico, they focus on his treasure and depict him as a cutthroat. Most of the hidden-treasure stories have a moral counseling against greed; those trying to find the plunder are killed, dragged to Davy Jones' Locker or attacked by the ghost of Cofresí or a member of his crew. Rumors about <b>the</b> <b>locations</b> of hidden treasure flourish, with dozens of coves, beaches and buildings linked to pirates in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola.|$|E

However, it is difficult to explain <b>the</b> real <b>location</b> of logistics facilities by these methods. This {{is due to the fact}} that road network or land use regulation influences on <b>the</b> <b>location</b> of logistics facilities. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the applicability of mathematical models to explain <b>the</b> mechanismfor <b>location</b> and relocation of logistics facilities. This paper tried to analyze the mechanism for <b>the</b> <b>location</b> and relocation of logistics facilities by evolutionary game theory and Markov Chain. In conclusion, it is clarified thatthese mathematical models are useful tools to explain <b>the</b> <b>location</b> and relocation of logistics facilities. 従来物流施設の立地を考えるときは、産業立地論をはじめとした経済立地や、配送距離最小の条件で求めるOR などが主な手法であった。しかし、現実の物流施設の立地は、道路ネットワークや用途地域制などの立地の制約があり、必ずしも理論通りに行かないことがある。本研究では、物流施設の立地について、従来の経済立地論やOR といった考え方以外の手法として、数理モデルの応用可能性を明らかにすることを目的としている。そして、物流施設の集積と移転問題に着目し、ゲーム理論と確率論による説明を試みた。その結果、物流施設の集積や移転をこれら数理モデルにより説明できる可能性を示すことができた。東京海洋大学海洋工学部流通情報工学...|$|R
