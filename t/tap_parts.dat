40|$|Abstract—To {{determine}} {{the length of}} engagement threads of a bolt installed in a <b>tapped</b> <b>part</b> {{in order to avoid}} the threads stripping remains a very current problem in the design of the thread assemblies. It does not exist a calculation method formalized for the cases where the bolt is screwed directly in a ductile material. In this article, we study the behavior of the threads stripping of a loaded assembly by using a modelling by finite elements and a rupture criterion by damage. This modelling enables us to study the different parameters likely to influence the behavior of this bolted connection. We study in particular, the influence of couple of materials constituting the connection, of the bolt’s diameter and the geometrical characteristics of the <b>tapped</b> <b>part,</b> like the external diameter and the length of engagement threads. We established an experiments design to know the most significant parameters. That enables us to propose a simple expression making possible to calculate the resistance of the threads whatever the metallic materials of the bolt and the <b>tapped</b> <b>part.</b> We carried out stripping tests in order to validate our model. The estimated results are very close to those obtained by the tests. Keywords—Bolt, damage, plasticity, stripping, thread assemblies. I...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} a {{tendency}} to increase the proportion of thread milling operations, among other ways of tapping, which is associated with increasing number of CNC machines, flexibility and versatility of the process. Developments presently existing in the RF and used in the thread mills deal, mainly, with the thread milling cutter designs, to process internal and external thread with straight flutes made from high-speed steel. The paper presents a technique to calculate and select the initial design parameters, i. e. the external diameter of the <b>tapping</b> <b>part</b> of thread milling cutter, which is chosen as a basic computational design.   The analysis of directories of tool companies containing foreign de-signs of solid thread end-milling cutters has shown that most of them rep-resent the thread cutter designs made of solid carbide. There are solid and interlocking side milling cutters, which use a <b>tapping</b> <b>part</b> both as a single-disk and as a multi-disk one; chip flutes are made to be both as direct and as screw; solid designs of cutters are made from carbide with a diameter of up to 20 [...] . 25 mm; thread cutters can be left- and right-hand cutting; Designs of the combined thread mills are proposed; internal channels are used for coolant supply. It is shown that the purpose of the external diameter of the <b>tapping</b> <b>part</b> of the thread mill should take into account the effect of the thread mill diameter on the milling process performance, precision of thread profile received, taper thread, tool strength, and the volume of flutes. The analysis has shown that when choosing the external diameter of the thread mill it worth taking its maximum diameter to improve the char-acteristics of the process under the restrictions imposed on the accuracy of the formed thread. </p...|$|R

This thesis introduces active randomization by a robot, both in selecting actions to execute and in focusing on sensory information to interpret, as a basic tool for overcoming uncertainty. An example of randomization is given by the strategy of shaking a bin containing a part in order to orient the part in a desired stable state with some high probability. Another example consists of first using reliable sensory information to bring two parts close together, then relying on short random motions to actually mate the two parts, once the part motions lie below the available sensing resolution. Further examples include <b>tapping</b> <b>parts</b> that are tightly wedged, twirling gears before trying to mesh them, and vibrating parts to facilitate a mating operation...|$|R

30|$|The {{weathering}} test {{leads to a}} relevant decrease of resin and lignin contents in tapped black pine wood. Roughness and color of the surface are highly affected. The stability of tapped black pine wood in terms of outdoor utilization rather focuses on the resistance against microbial attacks than on abiotic factors. According to the literature, abiotic weathering leads mainly to a destruction of lignin, whereas cellulose stays more stable. The main difference of tapping is the resin content, especially the highly resinous parts under the directly <b>tapped</b> <b>part</b> of the trunk. This resin featured more stable characteristics than lignin. Its characteristic band at 1688  cm−[*] 1 in the FTIR spectra was reduced after weathering, but {{at least at the}} highly resinous parts a certain amount remained. Despite higher roughness that {{can be explained by the}} decreasing lignin content, it can be concluded that the resin content protects wood against a subsequent biotic stress. The composting process affects more the resin acids, whereas the lignin (1688  cm−[*] 1) and cellulose (1026  cm−[*] 1) bands appear more distinct in the spectrum. It seems that a thin surface layer of resin protects lignin and cellulose. Further research of long-term composting experiments (>[*] 12 months) will show, how wood components are affected after the destruction of the resin coating.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: ascertaining {{the quality}} of life (QoL) in people with {{dementia}} is important for evaluating service outcomes and cost-effectiveness. This paper identifies QoL measures for people with dementia and assesses their properties. Method: a systematic narrative review identified articles using dementia QoL measures. Electronic databases searched were AMED, CINAHL, EMBASE, Index to Theses, IBSS, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, and Web of Science. All available years and languages (if with an English language abstract) were included. Results: searches yielded 6806 citations; 3043 were multiple duplicates (759 being true duplicates). Abstracts were read; 182 full papers were selected/obtained, of which 126 were included as relevant. Few measures were based on rigorous conceptual frameworks. Some referenced Lawton's model (Dementia Quality of Life [DQOL] and Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease [QOL-AD]), though these <b>tapped</b> <b>part</b> of this only; others claimed relationship to a health-related QoL concept (e. g. DEMQOL), though had less social relevance; others were based on limited domains (e. g. activity, affect) or clinical opinions (Quality of Life in Late-Stage Dementia [QUALID]). Many measures were based on proxy assessments or observations of people with dementia's QoL, rather than their own ratings. The Bath Assessment of Subjective Quality of Life in Dementia (BASQID) was developed involving people with dementia and caregivers, but excluded some of their main themes. All measures were tested on selective samples only (ranging from community to hospital clinics, or subsamples/waves of existing population surveys), in a few sites. Their general applicability remains unknown, and predictive validity remains largely untested. Conclusion: the lack of consensus on measuring QoL in dementia suggests a need for a broader, more rigorously tested QoL measure...|$|R

Twenty‐seven patients participated in this open‐label, randomized, single ‐ and multiple‐dose, crossover study.
