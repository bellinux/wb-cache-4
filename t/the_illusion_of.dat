Your Duty to Others: An admonishment to {{eliminate}} <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> separateness between oneself and all others, to fight when necessary, to avoid {{interfering with the}} Wills of others, to enlighten others when needed, and to worship the divine nature of all other beings.|$|E
5|$|The Baptism of Christ– portrays Jesus with John the Baptist at the River Jordan. Mottled {{glass is}} used for the area around the water, with a layer of wavy glass over Christ's left foot to create <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> looking through water.|$|E
5|$|Time is also {{connected}} {{to the theme of}} light and dark. In Shakespeare's day, plays were most often performed at noon or in the afternoon in broad daylight. This forced the playwright to use words to create <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> day and night in his plays. Shakespeare uses references to the night and day, the stars, the moon, and the sun to create this illusion. He also has characters frequently refer to days of the week and specific hours to help the audience understand that time has passed in the story. All in all, no fewer than 103 references to time are found in the play, adding to <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> its passage.|$|E

5|$|A {{technique}} was developed that combined the front projection effect with specially designed zoom lenses. <b>The</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> movement {{was created by}} zooming in on Reeve while making the front projected image appear to recede. For scenes where Superman interacts with other people or objects while in flight, Reeve and actors were put {{in a variety of}} rigging equipment with careful lighting and photography. This also {{led to the creation of}} the Zoptic system.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after hearing}} the rumours about the Qurayza, Muhammad had sent 100 men to the inner city for its protection. Later he sent 300 {{horsemen}} (cavalry was not needed at the trench) as well to protect the city. The loud voices, in which the troops prayed every night, created <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> a large force.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} portray the {{characters}} underwater, the actors wore Heelys wheeled footwear, which simulate the gliding action of swimming creatures. The actors playing Ariel and the other merfolk had wire-frame tails attached to their hips. Subsequent productions feature different designs for Ariel and the merfolk; the Dutch and Japanese productions use wirework and aerial stunts to create <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> underwater swimming.|$|E

5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> drugs, because they give you <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> getting closer to God, but {{ultimately}} they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E
5|$|Although the Madonna's throne {{is in the}} mid-ground, {{her head}} is level with the {{standing}} figures in the foreground, who are closer in perspective. The apse in which she sits adds to <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> depth and is an expanded area for her throne. A similar approach {{can be seen in}} the later Dresden Triptych, but that work contains a better handling of spatial depth; Mary's throne is moved back, and the donors and saints are relegated to wing panels. The figures in Canon van der Paele are within a more confined space, are somewhat cramped, but far more monumental.|$|E
5|$|Art Director Roger Christian used {{scrap metal}} and parts to create set pieces and props to save money, a {{technique}} he employed {{while working on}} Star Wars. For example, some of the Nostromo corridors were created from portions of scrapped bomber aircraft, and a mirror was used to create <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> longer corridors in the below-deck area. Special effects supervisors Brian Johnson and Nick Allder made many of the set pieces and props function, including moving chairs, computer monitors, motion trackers, and flamethrowers.|$|E

5|$|Quad {{have now}} brought out five {{generations of the}} classic {{electrostatic}} design. Originally designed for monaural sound in a domestic context, the popularisation of stereophonic sound prompted the manufacturer to modify the electrostatic panels to improve their stereo dispersion. These speakers featured larger panels and a revolutionary stator design, made up of eight concentric rings fed from the centre outwards through analogue delay lines, so that the audio signal gives <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> radiating from a point source one foot behind the panel.|$|E
5|$|Thayer's {{original}} argument, restated by Cott, {{was that}} nature did {{the exact opposite}} with countershading that an artist did with paint when creating <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> solid three-dimensionality, namely counteracting the effect of shade to flatten out form. Shading is a powerful cue used by animals in different phyla to identify the shapes of objects. Research with chicks showed that they preferred to peck at grains with shadows falling below them (as if illuminated from above), so both humans and birds may make use of shading as a depth cue.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} from a third person {{perspective}} with the camera at a variable height and capable of rotating 360°, enabling the player to quickly move across the planet's terrain. While the terrain's topology is a torus, the map is locally projected onto a sphere to give <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> a planet. On maps {{where there is no}} fog of war, players can see what opponents are doing at any time. Extensive support for 3D acceleration enables the player to view the game in 16-bit or 32-bit colour. The landscape and real-time structure building and follower movement are also shown.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> endless rows of Klingons {{was created}} by brightly {{lighting}} the accused {{in the center of}} the room with a bright blue light, then letting the rest of the set fall into shadow. To give the set a larger appearance, a shot from high above the courtroom was created using miniatures. Inspired by a scene in Ben-Hur, matte supervisor Craig Barron used two hundred commercially available Worf dolls sent by Ralph Winter. Angry Klingons were created by rocking the dolls back and forth with motors, waving sticks lit by twelve-volt light bulbs dyed red. The resulting courtroom miniature was ten feet long.|$|E
5|$|The main {{mechanisms}} {{to create the}} resemblances described by Poulton – whether in nature or in military applications – are crypsis, blending into the background so as to become hard to see (this covers both special and general resemblance); disruptive patterning, using colour and pattern {{to break up the}} animal's outline, which relates mainly to general resemblance; mimesis, resembling other objects of no special interest to the observer, which relates to special resemblance; countershading, using graded colour to create <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> flatness, which relates mainly to general resemblance; and counterillumination, producing light to match the background, notably in some species of squid.|$|E
5|$|The {{period after}} {{the defeat of}} the Spanish Armada in 1588 brought new {{difficulties}} for Elizabeth that lasted until the end of her reign. The conflicts with Spain and in Ireland dragged on, the tax burden grew heavier, and the economy was hit by poor harvests and the cost of war. Prices rose and the standard of living fell. During this time, repression of Catholics intensified, and Elizabeth authorised commissions in 1591 to interrogate and monitor Catholic householders. To maintain <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> peace and prosperity, she increasingly relied on internal spies and propaganda. In her last years, mounting criticism reflected a decline in the public's affection for her.|$|E

5|$|Thrice re-entered {{the studio}} with {{producer}} Brian McTernan to record its Hopeless/Sub City debut, <b>The</b> <b>Illusion</b> <b>of</b> Safety. The album was released in February 2002 and the band toured extensively to support it, opening for Further Seems Forever and Face to Face before embarking on its first headlining tour later that year. The band again donated {{a portion of the}} album's proceeds, this time choosing a non-profit youth shelter in South Central Los Angeles, A Place Called Home. The band's donations were matched by their label.|$|E
5|$|To enhance <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> the puppets, David Lane {{ensured that}} camera shots {{frequently}} omitted {{the tops of}} the heads and the visible control wires, and also incorporated low-angle shots for dramatic effect. Location shooting in Portugal was arranged for Lane, Derek Meddings and camera operator Alan Perry to film overhead landscape shots for the climax in which Alan rescues the Zero-X astronauts during re-entry. However, when the footage was deemed unsatisfactory, it was replaced with a painted backdrop made by associate producer Reg Hill.|$|E
5|$|Beauty and the Beast was {{the second}} film, after The Rescuers Down Under, {{produced}} using CAPS (Computer Animation Production System), a digital scanning, ink, paint, and compositing system of software and hardware developed for Disney by Pixar. The software allowed for {{a wider range of}} colors, as well as soft shading and colored line effects for the characters, techniques lost when the Disney studio abandoned hand inking for xerography in the late 1950s. CAPS also allowed the production crew to simulate multiplane effects: placing characters and/or backgrounds on separate layers and moving them towards/away from the camera on the Z-axis to give <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> depth, as well as altering the focus of each layer.|$|E
