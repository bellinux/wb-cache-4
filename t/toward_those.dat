5|$|And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic is a 1987 book by San Francisco Chronicle {{journalist}} Randy Shilts. The book {{chronicles the}} discovery and {{spread of the}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) with a special emphasis on government indifference and political infighting—specifically in the United States—to what was then perceived as a specifically gay disease. Shilts' premise is that AIDS was allowed to happen: while the disease {{is caused by a}} biological agent, incompetence and apathy <b>toward</b> <b>those</b> initially affected allowed its spread to become much worse.|$|E
5|$|Exponents of the universalist, anti-racist {{approach}} {{believe that}} the deities of Northern Europe can call anyone to their worship, regardless of ethnic background. This group rejects the folkish emphasis on race, believing that even if unintended, {{it can lead to}} the adoption of racist attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>those</b> of non-Northern European ancestry. Anti-racist practitioners such as Stephan Grundy have emphasized the fact that ancient Northern Europeans were known to marry and have children with members of other ethnic groups, and that in Norse mythology the Æsir also did the same with Vanir, Jötun, and humans, thus using such points to critique the racialist view. Universalists welcome practitioners of Heathenry who are not of Northern European ancestry; for instance, there are Jewish and African American members of the U.S.-based Troth, while many of its white members are married to spouses from different racial groups. While sometimes retaining the idea of Heathenry as an indigenous religion, proponents of this view have sometimes argued that Heathenry is indigenous to the land of Northern Europe, rather than indigenous to any specific race.|$|E

25|$|To cause {{growth in}} the {{required}} domains, auxins must of necessity be active preferentially in them. Local auxin maxima can be formed by active biosynthesis in certain cells of tissues, for example via tryptophan-dependent pathways, but auxins are not synthesized in all cells (even if cells retain the potential ability to do so, only under specific conditions will auxin synthesis be activated in them). For that purpose, auxins have {{to be not only}} translocated <b>toward</b> <b>those</b> sites where they are needed, but also they must have an established mechanism to detect those sites. For that purpose, auxins have to be translocated <b>toward</b> <b>those</b> sites where they are needed. Translocation is driven throughout the plant body, primarily from peaks of shoots to peaks of roots (from up to down).|$|E

25|$|Al-Mu'tazz was {{initially}} accommodating <b>toward</b> <b>those</b> in Samarra who opposed {{his bid for}} the caliphate, and did not compel anyone to swear the oath to him if they refused to do so. He did, however, write to commanders stationed throughout the empire requesting their support, and soon reinforcements were arriving in Samarra. As the conflict progressed, he steadily gained followers as members of al-Musta'in's camp began to defect to him. He also made efforts to entice al-Musta'in's officers, writing offers to them and promising substantial rewards if they would switch their allegiance to him.|$|E
25|$|Huberty {{shot and}} killed a 62-year-old trucker named Laurence Versluis, before {{targeting}} one of the families near the play area of the restaurant, {{who had tried to}} shield their children beneath the tables with their bodies. Blythe Regan Herrera (aged 31) had shielded her 11-year-old son, Mateo, beneath one booth, and her husband protected 12-year-old Keith Thomas under a booth across from them. Huberty began shooting people seated in the restaurant as he walked <b>toward</b> <b>those</b> under the tables. Ronald Herrera urged Thomas not to move, shielding the boy with his body. Thomas was shot in the shoulder, arm, wrist, and left elbow, but was not seriously wounded; Ronald Herrera was shot eight times in the stomach, chest, arm, and head but survived; his wife, Blythe, and son, Mateo, were both killed by numerous gunshots to the head.|$|E

25|$|An anti-Semitic {{campaign}} swept Romanian {{universities in}} the wake of World War I. In this context, at the time the 1920-1921 school year opened, Pușcariu expressed his concern that Jews were disproportionately represented in the Medicine and Law faculties. He suggested they congregated <b>toward</b> <b>those</b> subjects because of surer and more profitable career prospects, given the lack of doctors, administrators and magistrates in Romania's newly acquired provinces. A numerus clausus was enacted in Hungary in September 1920, leading to a surge in Hungarian Jewish enrollment at Cluj. Prompted by the medical faculty's leadership, the university senate discussed introduction of a similar policy. In early 1921, students, later joined by cultural figures, began demanding that sociologist Eugen Ehrlich be fired from his professorship at Cernăuți. Ehrlich was a Jew who had converted to Catholicism, but the primary motivating factor in his firing {{appears to have been a}} campaign to fill teaching posts with ethnic Romanians. Ehrlich, who was rector in 1906-1907, had been instrumental in Pușcariu's being hired at the university. However, no one intervened on his behalf; not even Pușcariu tried to stop his benefactor's dismissal.|$|E

Although she sometimes acted rudely <b>toward</b> <b>those</b> who disagreed with her, she nevertheless gained a reputation for constant helpfulness and patient guidance of new students. Her loyalty to mathematical precision caused one colleague to name her [...] "a severe critic", but she combined this demand for accuracy with a nurturing attitude.

He tends to tease the girls he knows, {{especially}} his childhood friend Mizuka Nagamori, but deep down he is generally nice to girls. Mizuka usually takes good care of him, and worries about Kōhei, wondering if he could suddenly get a girlfriend. She is constantly sighing, being made to go along with Kōhei's meaningless jokes. Kōhei meets a transfer student named Rumi Nanase early in the story whose goal is to become a [...] "true maiden" [...] and to that end, she behaves maidenly <b>toward</b> <b>those</b> around her, but she shows her true character just to Kōhei, who leaves a terrible first impression.

The MoI said it will [...] "deal with any attempt to disturb security and stability". In anticipation to the 14 August protests, the MoI stepped up security measures and further warned {{that it will take}} legal action <b>toward</b> <b>those</b> who participate. The MOI has warned Bahrainis: [...] The Prime Minister joined the MoI in warning against planned protests. [...] The Al Wefaq opposition movement slammed the warnings and affirmed [...] "the [...] right to protest peacefully". [...] "This will not solve the political crisis. The solution is in satisfying the people's aspirations for liberty, social justice and democracy," [...] Al Wefaq added. Other opposition societies such as National Democratic Action Society (Waad) and Nationalist Democratic Assembly also joined Al Wefaq in affirming the rights of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. Mainstream opposition societies cancelled a planned mass protest on 14 August, [...] "because of the heavily intimidating security presence in Manama".|$|E

500|$|The {{scene where}} the cast {{is trying to}} get back to the {{elevator}} after hooking up actor Stellan Skarsgård to the helicopter is actually an accident that made it into the finished film. As Jackson explained, [...] "At one point three tons of water got thrown on us by accident and we got swept <b>toward</b> <b>those</b> cargo bays and everyone thought we were going into the drink and people were tumbling around this metal grating [...] We scrambled up and kept acting [...] That was not supposed to happen and we didn't have safety harnesses on and we were flailing around on this deck." [...] Jackson was initially offered the role played by LL Cool J, but his management team did not like the idea of him playing a chef, so Harlin created the role of Russell Franklin for him. Additionally, LL Cool J's character was supposed to die early on, but the director ultimately decided to keep him. The production team could not afford to have a fully trained parrot for LL Cool J's character, so they used two parrots: one that was good at flying, and another that could sit on his shoulder.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 July, St. Clair decided to {{withdraw}} the men occupying the defence post at Mount Hope, which was exposed and subject to capture.

[...] That afternoon, a company of British soldiers and Indians came <b>toward</b> <b>those</b> lines, but not near enough to do significant damage, and opened fire. [...] St. Clair ordered his men to hold their fire until the enemy was closer, but James Wilkinson fired at a British soldier, spurring the untrained defenders to follow suit. [...] The soldier Wilkinson fired at fell, and the British troops fled. [...] When the man was captured, it turned out he was uninjured, and that he had fallen down because he was drunk. [...] Through the deception of placing him with a man posing as a captured Loyalist, St. Clair learned the nature of the opposing forces.|$|E
