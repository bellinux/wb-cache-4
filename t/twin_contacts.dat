25|$|Twinning is the intergrowth {{of two or}} more crystal of {{a single}} mineral species. The {{geometry}} of the twinning is controlled by the mineral's symmetry. As a result, there are several types of <b>twins,</b> including <b>contact</b> <b>twins,</b> reticulated twins, geniculated twins, penetration twins, cyclic twins, and polysynthetic <b>twins.</b> <b>Contact,</b> or simple <b>twins,</b> consist of two crystals joined at a plane; this type of twinning is common in spinel. Reticulated twins, common in rutile, are interlocking crystals resembling netting. Geniculated twins have a bend in the middle that is caused by start of the twin. Penetration twins consist of two single crystals that have grown into each other; examples of this twinning include cross-shaped staurolite twins and Carlsbad twinning in orthoclase. Cyclic twins are caused by repeated twinning around a rotation axis. It occurs around three, four, five, six, or eight-fold axes, and the corresponding patterns are called threelings, fourlings, fivelings, sixlings, and eightlings. Sixlings are common in aragonite. Polysynthetic twins are similar to cyclic twinning by the presence of repetitive twinning; however, instead of occurring around a rotational axis, it occurs along parallel planes, usually on a microscopic scale.|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{model for}} tensile {{twinning}} during the compression of rod textured magnesium is developed {{based on the}} idea that these twins nucleate at grain boundaries and that when the twin number density per grain is low these twins readily give rise to the formation of other `interaction' twins in adjacent grains. Experimental observations of twin aspect ratios measured at a single grain size and twin number densities measured over four grain sizes were used to determine model material parameters. Using these, the model provides reasonable predictions for the observed magnitudes and trends for the following observations: 1) Effect of grain size and stress on twin volume fraction, fractional twin length and the fraction of <b>twin</b> <b>contact.</b> 2) Effect of grain size on the yield stress. 3) Effect of grain size on the general shape of the stress-strain curve at low strains. A parametric study shows the model to be quite robust but that it is particularly sensitive to the value of the exponent assumed for the twin nucleation rate law. It is seen that preventing the formation of interaction twins provides an important avenue for hardening and that the flow stress is also particularly sensitive to the relaxation of the twin back stresses.

40|$|Abstract Background Co-bedding, a {{developmental}} care strategy, is {{the practice of}} caring for diaper clad twins in one incubator (versus separating and caring for each infant in separate incubators), thus creating the opportunity for skin-to-skin contact and touch between the twins. In studies of mothers and their infants, maternal skin-to-skin contact {{has been shown to}} decrease procedural pain response according to both behavioral and physiological indicators in very preterm neonates. It is uncertain if this comfort is derived solely from maternal presence or from stabilization of regulatory processes from direct skin contact. The intent {{of this study is to}} compare the comfort effect of co-bedding (between twin infants who are co-bedding and those who are not) on infant pain response and physiologic stability during a tissue breaking procedure (heelstick). Methods/Design Medically stable preterm twin infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit will be randomly assigned to a co-bedding group or a standard care group. Pain response will be measured by physiological and videotaped facial reaction using the Premature Infant Pain Profile scale (PIPP). Recovery from the tissue breaking procedure will be determined by the length of time for heart rate and oxygen saturation to return to baseline. Sixty four sets of twins (n = 128) will be recruited into the study. Analysis and inference will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. Discussion If <b>twin</b> <b>contact</b> while co-bedding is determined to have a comforting effect for painful procedures, then changes in current neonatal care practices to include co-bedding may be an inexpensive, non invasive method to help maintain physiologic stability and decrease the long term psychological impact of procedural pain in this high risk population.

40|$|International audienceArsenopyrite from La Roche-Balue quarry (Loire-Atlantique department, France), {{with the}} {{stoichiometric}} composition FeAsS, {{has been studied}} by X-ray single-crystal diffraction and 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy. Its unit cell is a 5. 7612 (8), b 5. 6841 (7), c 5. 7674 (8) Å, β 111. 721 (8) °, and V 175. 46 (4) Å 3 (Z = 4). Taking into account very fine ubiquitous twinning on { 101 }, its crystal structure has been refined in the space group P 21 /c {{on the basis of}} 758 unique reflections [Fo > 4 σ(Fo) ] to R 1 = 0. 0298. Within uncertainty limits, it indicates three unmixed Fe, As and S positions. The 57 Fe Mössbauer spectrum of this arsenopyrite shows two broad absorption peaks that were fitted using the superposition of three doublets denoted as A, B and C, with parameters relative to area S, isomer shift δ, and quadrupole splitting ΔEQ, as follows: SA 82. 2 %, δA 0. 24 (1) mm/s, ΔEQA 1. 12 (2) mm/s; SB 8. 5 %, δB 0. 25 (1) mm/s, ΔEQB 0. 69 (2) mm/s; SC 9. 3 %, δC 0. 26 (1) mm/s, ΔEQC 1. 49 (2) mm/s. This set of values agrees well with the most recently published results for arsenopyrite samples with a composition close to stoichiometry. The three distinct Fe positions indicated by Mössbauer spectroscopy are not visible in the X-ray study. Whereas the main doublet A would seem to correspond to the FeAs 3 S 3 octahedron of the ideal structure, the two minor doublets B and C, with a ΔEQ shift towards marcasite and löllingite, respectively, may be due to local disorder (e. g., <b>twin</b> <b>contact</b> walls) changing the octahedral coordination of Fe to unequal As:S ratios...|$|R
