5|$|Gatiss {{originally}} resisted having Dickens {{star in the}} episode, as {{traditionally the}} Doctor only mentioned meeting historical figures, but he eventually warmed to the idea. As A Christmas Carol fan, Gatiss wanted to set the episode at Christmas. He later realised that Dickens' journey in the episode mirrored that of Ebenezer Scrooge. In one scene, Gatiss wanted the knocker on a door behind Dickens to briefly show the Gelth's face in reference to A Christmas Carol, but this visual effect was not done. The episode originally began in the TARDIS, as Gatiss wanted the first glimpse of 1860 to be through Rose's eyes. While this changed, Gatiss still wanted to show how great travelling in <b>time</b> <b>is.</b> <b>It</b> was scripted that snow would blow into the TARDIS when the doors opened, but this was cut because of budget reasons. Davies requested {{a scene in which}} the Doctor takes Rose to the future to see a world filled with walking corpses— the result if they had left before defeating the Gelth— but this was too expensive to film. During the scene in which the Doctor and Dickens are talking in the coach, the driver was supposed to shout down to them (referencing a Dickens work) and the coach was to crash, but this was also too expensive.|$|E
500|$|Soon after Park {{returned}} to the United States, the South Korean public changed their perspective on the matter when they realized that his Myspace messages had been severely mistranslated and taken out of context, in addition to strong fan support for Park's return. Park was seen at b-boy battles with fellow Art of Movement members during his time in Seattle. However, on February 25, with Park's comeback {{looking more and more}} likely, JYP suddenly announced that Jay Park's contract with them had been terminated, citing a separate [...] "personal mistake" [...] that Park had made in 2009. JYP would make reference to this unknown event several times in 2010, but would never elaborate on any details. This termination had been agreed by all 6 members of 2PM and led to fan boycotts on 2PM-endorsed products. Protests for Park's return to the group began to take place, not only in South Korea, but internationally as well. Various Jay Park-dedicated forums and fansites all over the world organized silent protests and flash dance mobs. Fans also hired a plane with a banner showing [...] "J, what <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> now?" [...] to fly over Seattle, and was broadcast on Seattle-based radio stations.|$|E
