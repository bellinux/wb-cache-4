50|$|Fishing <b>tackle</b> boxes {{have for}} many years been an {{essential}} part of the anglers equipment. Fishing <b>tackle</b> boxes were originally made of wood or wicker and eventually some metal fishing <b>tackle</b> boxes were manufactured. The first plastic fishing <b>tackle</b> boxes were manufactured by Plano in response to the need for a product that didn't rust. Early plastic fishing <b>tackle</b> boxes were similar to tool boxes but soon evolved into the hip roof cantilever <b>tackle</b> boxes with numerous small trays for small <b>tackle.</b> These types of <b>tackle</b> boxes are still available today but they have the disadvantage that small <b>tackle</b> gets mixed up. Fishing <b>tackle</b> boxes have also been manufactured so the drawers themselves become small storage boxes, each with their own lids. This prevents small <b>tackle</b> from mixing, and can turn each drawer into a stand-alone container which can be used to carry small <b>tackle</b> to a rod some distance from the main <b>tackle</b> box.|$|R

2500|$|If the {{defending}} team 'knocks on' or touches the ball when it's in the air, {{and the ball}} is immediately regathered by the attacking team, the referee may elect to restart the <b>tackle</b> count in lieu of awarding a scrum; known as the zero <b>tackle</b> rule because the next <b>tackle</b> is counted as 'tackle zero' and not the usual 'tackle one'. The zero <b>tackle</b> rule cannot {{be used in a}} set that was started by the zero <b>tackle</b> rule. On awarding the zero <b>tackle</b> rule, the referee will shout [...] "Back to zero!" [...] or [...] "Six again", and wave one arm over his head with fingers clenched into a fist, indicating the attacking side's next <b>tackle</b> is <b>tackle</b> zero. If a player collects the ball directly from an opposition kick in general play, the first time he is <b>tackled</b> does not register on the <b>tackle</b> count. If the receiving player kicks or passes the ball prior to being <b>tackled</b> then this does not apply.|$|R
