The film, only ten days after its debut, influenced the Central Board of Secondary Education to provide extra time to special children—including the visually impaired, physically challenged and dyslexic—during exams. In 2008, Mumbai's civic body also opened 12classrooms for autistic students.

40|$|I present new {{evidence}} {{on the effects of}} having a same-sex or same-race <b>teacher</b> <b>on</b> two salient outcomes: teacher expectations for postsecondary attainment and teacher recommendations for advanced courses. My identification strategy conditions on all subject-invariant student traits to provide causal estimates of the effects using data from the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002. Across the full sample, there is little evidence of an effect of having a same-sex or a same-race <b>teacher</b> <b>on</b> expectations or recommendations. However, I find surprisingly large effects for Black students <b>on</b> <b>teacher</b> expectations. For these students, the effect of a same-race <b>teacher</b> <b>on</b> <b>teacher</b> expectations to complete more than high school is between 11 and 17 percentage points. This effect is at least 70 % of the White–Black race gap in teacher expectations...|$|R
5|$|Converts were {{provided}} with elaborate details of Ernest and Ruth Norman's purported spiritual visits to other planets. The couple believed that humans could learn from great <b>teachers</b> <b>on</b> these journeys; Ernest said that this contact held the potential to educate and heal humanity. Ernest also spoke of the scientific advancements of other worlds. The couple also discussed revelations about their past lives, including Jesus and Mary of Bethany among their past identities. Ruth stated that she had lived about 50lives over several million years; she recalled being several well-known and a few obscure people on Earth, as well as beings from other planets and an archangel. Their group developed a mythology from the accounts that Ernest and Ruth gave of these lives, including tales from their past incarnations in Atlantis and Lemuria. Some of their stories were similar to the plots of contemporary books and films, prompting Tumminia to cast their beliefs as a pastiche or bricolage of the surrounding culture.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the school}} year, Nikumbh organises an art fair for the staff and students. The {{competition}} is judged by artist Lalita Lajmi. Ishaan, with his strikingly creative style, is declared the winner and Nikumbh, who paints Ishaan's portrait, the runner-up. The principal announces that Nikumbh has been hired as the school's permanent art teacher. When Ishaan's parents meet his <b>teachers</b> <b>on</b> the last day of school they are left speechless by the transformation they see in him. Overcome with emotion, Ishaan's father thanks Nikumbh. As Ishaan gets into the car to leave with his parents for summer vacations, he turns around and runs toward Nikumbh, who gives him a hug and tells him to return next year. The film ends with a freeze-frame shot of Nikumbh tossing Ishaan into the air.|$|E
5|$|Wilkinson {{made her}} first {{priority}} {{the raising of}} the school leaving age. This required the recruitment and training of thousands of extra teachers, and creating classroom space for almost 400,000 extra children. Under the Emergency Training Scheme (ETS), ex-servicemen and women were given grants to train as <b>teachers</b> <b>on</b> an accelerated one-year programme; more than 37,000 had been or were being trained {{by the end of}} 1946. The rapid expansion of school premises was achieved by the erection of temporary huts—some of which became long-term features of schools. Wilkinson was determined that the higher leaving age be implemented by 1 April 1947—the date set by the 1944 Act—and in the face of parliamentary scepticism insisted that her plans were on track. Final cabinet approval to honour the April date was given on 16 January 1947.|$|E

5|$|Zappa's {{interest}} in composing and arranging flourished {{in his last}} high-school years.

He graduated from Antelope Valley High School in 1958, and later acknowledged two of his music <b>teachers</b> <b>on</b> the sleeve of the 1966 album Freak Out! Due to his family's frequent moves, Zappa attended at least six different high schools, and as a student he was often bored and given to distracting {{the rest of the}} class with juvenile antics. In 1959, he attended Chaffey College but left after one semester, and maintained thereafter a disdain for formal education, taking his children out of school at age 15 and refusing to pay for their college.|$|E
5|$|The Teaneck Community Charter School (TCCS) had a 2011–12 {{enrollment}} of 306 students in Kindergarten through eighth grade with 26.0 classroom <b>teachers</b> (<b>on</b> an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 11.77:1.

As the school is a public school, no tuition is charged. Funding comes from the Teaneck Public Schools (and the home districts of non-resident students), which provides 90% of its cost per pupil in the district; the balance of funding comes directly from the state of New Jersey. The school moved to a new building at 563 Chestnut Avenue in the 2009–10 school year, from a space it had rented on Palisade Avenue.|$|E
