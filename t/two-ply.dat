2500|$|Yarns {{can be made}} of two, three, four, or more plies, or {{may be used as}} singles without plying. <b>Two-ply</b> yarn {{can also}} be plied from both ends of one long strand of singles using a centre-pull ball, where one end feeds from within a ball of yarn while the other end feeds from the outside. [...] So-called [...] "Andean" [...] plying, in which the single is first wound around one hand in a {{specific}} manner that allows unwinding both ends at once without tangling, is another way to ply smaller amounts of yarn. [...] The name comes from a method used by Andean spinners to manage and splice unevenly matched singles being plied from multiple spindles. [...] "Navajo" [...] (aka [...] "chain-") plying is another method of producing a three-ply yarn, in which one strand of singles is looped around itself {{in a manner similar to}} crochet and the resulting three parallel strands twisted together. This method is often used to keep colours together on singles dyed in sequential colours. Cabled yarns are usually four-ply yarns made by plying two strands of <b>two-ply</b> yarn together in the direction opposite to the plying direction for the <b>two-ply</b> yarns.|$|E
40|$|This project {{develops}} and experimentally validates nonlinear {{models for}} high-speed yarn transport systems. The {{research focuses on}} models for specific textile processes that involve rotating balloons such as: i) unwinding from cylindrical (as in texturing) or conical (as in warping and weaving) packages; ii) ring twisting and winding (as in ring spinning or ply-twisting); and iii) two-for-one twisting. The computer models provide insight into and promote understanding of the complex process dynamics. The models {{can also be used}} to design processes that provide low, uniform tension at high speed. This maximizes the process efficiency by minimizing yarn breaks and maximizing throughput. During the last year of this project, our interdisciplinary, international group of researchers developed new models for several complex yarn manufacturing processes and new, modelverifying experiments. At North Carolina State University Subhash Batra, Tushar Ghosh, Bill Oxenham, and their students refined models for the unwinding process and conducted ring-spinning experiments. Barrie Fraser at the University of Sydney in Australia developed twist models for ring-spinning and <b>two-plying</b> operations. Under the guidanc...|$|R

During the second year, this interdisciplinary, international research group developed and experimentally validated computer models for ring spinning, twisting, and unwinding. New models for unwinding near the package ends and with conical packages were developed. Several ring-spinning experiments were completed that demonstrate the applicability of low cost proximity sensors for tension monitoring. Improved models for yarn twist in ring-spinning and <b>two-plying</b> enable prediction of system performance. The Unwinding Analyzer has been improved to allow simultaneous capture of high-speed videos, balloon rotation rate, and tension during unwinding. F 97 -C 5 Page- 2...|$|R
2500|$|Fossilised {{fragments}} of [...] "probably <b>two-ply</b> laid rope of about 7 mm diameter" [...] {{have been found}} in one of the caves at Lascaux, dated about 15,000 BC. Egyptian rope dates back to 4000 to 3500 BC and was generally made of water reed fibers. Other rope in antiquity was made from the fibers of date palms, flax, grass, papyrus, leather, or animal hair. [...] Rope made of hemp fibres was in use in China from about 2800 BC.|$|E
2500|$|The glider had a simple, wide, {{rectangular}} {{cross section}} fuselage with four cross braced longerons forming trusses. It was skinned with <b>two-ply,</b> {{with a final}} fabric covering. From the side the nose was smoothly rounded into a single curvature form with the open cockpit behind it, placing the pilot's seat close to quarter chord. [...] Aft the depth decreased and the tailplane {{was attached to the}} top with the fuselage ending at the coincident elevator and rudder hinges. The horizontal tail surfaces were roughly rectangular and the elevator was a single piece structure. [...] The fin was a quadrant and the rudder almost semicircular but cut away below for elevator movement. All the tail surfaces were wood framed and fabric covered. The Stehaufchen's undercarriage was a parallel pair of skids, intended to protect the low set lower wing on take-off and landings. The unusually broad fuselage enabled the skids to be separated by [...] [...] These were ash, laminated and of double curvature attached at three points, one below the pilot's feet and the others below each wing spar. The final section behind the rear mounting point curved down a little to protect the tail.|$|E

50|$|The {{creation}} of <b>two-ply</b> yarn requires two separate spools of singles and either a lazy kate {{or something to}} hold the spools in place. On a wheel, <b>two-ply</b> is created by taking two spools of singles, placing them on a lazy kate, tying the ends together onto the spool attached to the wheel, and spinning the wheel {{in the opposite direction}} to that in which the singles were spun, while also feeding the yarn onto the spool on the wheel. On a drop spindle, <b>two-ply</b> is created by placing the spools on a lazy kate, tying the ends together onto the drop spindle, holding equal lengths of singles together and dropping the spindle. The weight of the drop spindle combined with the twist in the singles, causes the drop spindle to turn in the opposite direction that the singles were twisted in until the two singles are plied together.|$|E

Garments such as these were worn interchangeably either around the waist as a piupiu, or across the shoulder as a cape.
