5|$|In 1819, {{smoke was}} {{observed}} at the mountain. However, this is often not recorded as an eruption as <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>was</b> insufficient to identify it as such.

5|$|In 1895, the Marquess of Queensbury {{was charged}} at Vine Street Police Station with libel against Oscar Wilde. This {{ultimately}} led to Wilde's arrest and subsequent imprisonment. On 29 May 1901, the stonemason James Schulty reported he had information about the murder of Mary Ann Austin but refused to reveal details anywhere except the Vine Street Police Station. <b>The</b> <b>information</b> <b>was</b> discarded by the Metropolitan Police as little value.|$|E

5|$|According to Martin Špegelj, the Defence Minister of Croatia between August 1990 and July 1991, the Croatian Army was {{informed}} by a Yugoslav Air Force Željava Air Base-based source about a top secret mission {{prepared for the}} next day, but Špegelj claims that <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>was</b> not taken seriously {{due to lack of}} details. Other sources assert that a warning was conveyed by Croatian security and intelligence system services, indicating the Soviet Union and its then-president Mikhail Gorbachev as the source of the information. At midnight during the night of the 67 October, the Soviet ambassador to Belgrade was reported to have received government instructions to warn the Yugoslav military against attacking Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|Although many {{messages}} were sent by agents, the Twenty Committee considered that Ironside was quite unrealistic {{and as a}} result was cautious about promoting it too heavily. Most of <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>was</b> sent with words of caution or uncertainty to ensure that the agent would not be compromised. One of the most critical Bodyguard agents, Garbo, did become involved on 5 June, but only in forwarding the message of a fictional sub-agent who he had already identified as unreliable (MI5 hoped that this would cover for, in their opinion, the implausible nature of the story). The agent's report explained that a US division based in Liverpool was preparing to head to Bordeaux.|$|E
5|$|Historiographical {{studies of}} the May Revolution do not face many doubts or unknown details. Most of <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>was</b> {{properly}} recorded {{at the time and}} was made available to the public by the Primera Junta as patriotic propaganda. Because of this, historical views on the topic differ in their interpretations of the meanings, causes and consequences of the events, rather than in the accuracy of their depiction of the events themselves. The modern version of events does not differ significantly from the contemporary one.|$|E
50|$|My {{conclusion}} is that {{the words in the}} Schedule mean the BBC has no obligation to disclose information which they hold to any significant extent for the purposes of journalism, art or literature, whether or not <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>is</b> also held for other purposes. The words do not mean that <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>is</b> disclosable if it is held for purposes distinct from journalism, art or literature, whilst it is also held to any significant extent for those listed purposes. If <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>is</b> held for mixed purposes, including to any significant extent the purposes listed in the Schedule or one of them, then <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>is</b> not disclosable.|$|R

5|$|In 1984, Carlos Rodríguez Rodríguez {{was convicted}} on bank fraud charges {{and became an}} FBI {{informant}} {{in exchange for a}} lower sentence.

During this time, there were internal issues between Segarra and group leaders Ojeda and Avelino González, with the first being considered inefficient by the others and general concern arising from his reputation as an unfaithful husband. On January 25, 1985, the EPB detonated a bomb in an empty United States Courthouse, later noting that it was a tribute to Juan Antonio Corretjer.|$|E
5|$|In June 1854, McClellan {{was sent}} {{on a secret}} {{reconnaissance}} mission to Santo Domingo {{at the behest of}} Jefferson Davis. McClellan assessed local defensive capabilities for the secretary. (<b>The</b> <b>information</b> <b>was</b> not used until 1870, when President Ulysses S.

Davis was beginning to treat McClellan almost as a protégé, and his next assignment was to assess the logistical readiness of various railroads in the United States, once again with an eye toward planning for the transcontinental railroad. In March 1855, McClellan was promoted to captain and assigned to the 1st U.S. Cavalry regiment.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{resuming}} his naval duties, Scott {{revealed to}} the Royal Geographical Society his intention to return to Antarctica, but <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>was</b> not at that stage made public. Scott was forestalled by Shackleton, who early in 1907 announced his plans to lead an expedition with the twin objectives of reaching the geographic and magnetic South Poles. Under duress, Shackleton agreed not to work from McMurdo Sound, which Scott was claiming as his own sphere of work. In the event, {{unable to find a}} safe landing elsewhere, Shackleton was forced to break this promise. His expedition was highly successful, its southern march ending at 88°23′, less than 100 geographical miles from the South Pole, while its northern party reached the location of the South Magnetic Pole. However, Shackleton's breach of his undertaking caused a significant break in relations between the two men, with Scott dismissing his former companion as a liar and a rogue.|$|E

5|$|The exact date of his {{reception}} is a mystery. According to Maiorescu's own recollections, written some {{decades after}} the event, Creangă was in attendance at a Junimea meeting of 1871, during which Gheorghe Costaforu proposed to transform the club into a political party. <b>The</b> <b>information</b> <b>was</b> considered dubious by Z. Ornea, who argued that the episode may have been entirely invented by the Junimist leader, and noted that it contradicted both Negruzzi's accounts and minutes kept by A. D. Xenopol. According to Ornea's assessment, {{with the exception of}} literary critic Vladimir Streinu, all of Creangă's biographers have come to dismiss Maiorescu's statement. Several sources mention that the future writer was introduced to the society by Eminescu, who was an active member around 1875. This and other details lead Ornea to conclude that membership was granted to Creangă only after the summer break of 1875.|$|E
5|$|The first {{identified}} {{tropical storm}} {{of the season}} is listed in the Atlantic hurricane database as having formed on June 24, positioned in the western Caribbean Sea; the estimate for this location was based on ship reports, although <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>was</b> insufficient to guarantee an accurate position. It initially meandered west-northwestward, though began to turn northwest during {{the latter half of}} following day. Late on June 26, it passed between the Yucatán Peninsula and Cuba, and subsequently entered the Gulf of Mexico shortly thereafter. The tropical storm continued to slowly intensify, and started to make sharp curve towards the northeast on June 28.|$|E
5|$|The {{flagship}} of the Russian Pacific squadron, Bogatyr under Rear Admiral Andrey Alexandrovich Popov, officially made {{a friendly}} visit to Melbourne in early 1863. According to information {{passed on to}} Australian authorities in June 1864, Rear Admiral A.A. Popov had {{in the first half}} of the year 1863 received orders and a plan of attack on the British naval ships positioned near the Australian shore. The plan also included shelling and destruction of the Melbourne, Sydney and Hobart coastal batteries. <b>The</b> <b>information</b> <b>was</b> attributed to the Polish lieutenant Władysław Zbyszewski of the Bogatyr, who had deserted from service in Shanghai soon after Bogatyr left Australia, and found his way to Paris to join the Polish January Uprising. This information about Popov's plans was forwarded by a fellow Pole, a certain S. Rakowsky. Similar attack orders are known to have been given to the Atlantic squadron under Rear Admiral Lessovsky, that was sent to New York at the same time.|$|E

5|$|Cunningham and Rawnsley {{were soon}} ordered to staff positions. It was a {{compulsory}} order for fighter pilots {{even when the}} men considered themselves fit for operational duties. Before they departed Middle Wallop and 604, {{they had a chance}} to test the new 4-inch (10 cm) AI Mk. VIII radar which had a range of two or three miles (3–5 kilometres). The new radar was a radical improvement. All <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>was</b> displayed on a single tube. The ground echo was reduced but could still be seen on screen when flying low, but it did not interfere with the overall picture. Cunningham was to take over as director of all training units from Rory Chisholm who left 604 to become a staff officer at group headquarters. Rawnsley was due to take an instructors job at 62 Operational Training Unit (OTU) at Usworth. Cunningham managed to persuade the CAS to deploy him to headquarters at No. 81 Group RAF, the training organisation for RAF Fighter Command. Rawnsley was also promoted to squadron leader and was awarded the DFC and Distinguished Flying Medal (DFM). The pair remained grounded for six months until January 1943.|$|E
5|$|For 11 {{hours the}} German fleet sailed from Brest into the English Channel to the Dover Straits. By chance, a {{mechanic}} {{on the radar}} station at Fairlight, East Sussex had just finished repairing the equipment when he picked up 27 echos at 10:15 on 12 February, south of Cap Gris Nez. <b>The</b> <b>information</b> <b>was</b> relayed to Vice-Admiral Bertram Ramsay, who ordered his Air Officer liaison to contact No. 11 Group RAF to ask for armed reconnaissance. Ramsay also warned No. 16 Group RAF and the FAA squadron operating out of RAF Manston that there were possible targets were in the Channel, despite not knowing the exact number or size of the enemy vessels. The performance of the radar was down to the jamming of the sets (Ballstöranlage) by two Heinkel He 111s which had been flying off the south coast from their airfield near Paris. The flights ceased at 09:00 when installations along the French coast had taken over. The detection by Fairlight {{was a piece of}} good fortune, the Germans had assumed it to be out of action. Ten Dornier Do 217s from III./KG 2 flew missions against Plymouth harbour and airfield, while 15 flew diversion missions to keep RAF fighters clear of the He 111s.|$|E
5|$|In mid-July, the Battle of the Ruhr {{was coming}} to an end and Bomber Command refocused its efforts on the port city of Hamburg in {{northern}} Germany. The codename for the attack was Operation Gomorrah; the objective was the destruction of Hamburg. The operations began on 24 July 1943 and during four major night-attacks by the RAF and two minor day-attacks by United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) between 40,000 and 50,000 civilians were killed. To counter the mounting success of the German night fighter force, which was directly attributed to the introduction of the Lichtenstein radar, the RAF introduced Window (Chaff or Düppel to the Germans). Window was a radar countermeasure in which aircraft spread a cloud of small, thin pieces of aluminium which effectively made it impossible for the German radar operator to identify the genuine target. Saturation of the Himmelbett control areas by a bomber stream and the introduction of Window practically made the previous Himmelbett procedure obsolete. This was also evident to the German high command. To counter these British measures two new strategies were pursued, Wilde Sau (Wild Boar) and Zahme Sau (Tame Boar). Wilde Sau, conceived by Hans-Joachim Herrmann, was a technique by which the RAF bombers were mainly engaged by single-seat fighter planes, illuminated by searchlights, over the target area. The Zahme Sau procedure, proposed by Viktor von Loßberg, called for a night fighter to infiltrate the bomber stream. The position, altitude, and general direction was then broadcast. <b>The</b> <b>information</b> <b>was</b> received by other night fighters, who navigated to the bomber stream by themselves. In Zahme Sau, the German night fighters were tracked and radio-controlled by means of Y-Verfahren (Y-Control). Schnaufer did not make any claims during Operation Gomorrah. Their next success came when he and Freymann shot down a Lancaster on 10/11 August 1943 at 00:32. The target that night was Nuremberg and it was the first aerial victory of the entire German night fighter force achieved by Y-Control. This was also the last victory with Freymann and his last as a member of II. Gruppe.|$|E
