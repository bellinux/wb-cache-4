However, it lost popularity thereafter as {{it became}} associated with the chaotic and violent period around {{the collapse of the}} Soviet Union. The wine-red colour symbolises the good times in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> while the black represents Russian rule, and the white represents hope for peace.|$|E
25|$|Thematically, moral {{ambiguity}} is {{a prominent}} feature of Brian's work. Extreme cases of loyalty and antagonism are personified in characters such as Noelle Lange and Ivy Slade—to degrees that are sometimes questioned or denounced by the narrator. However, {{it is often}} only after the details of another character's background have been revealed that Brennan can understand what motivates them, which will occasionally leave her conflicted in her judgments. The series has companion works, set in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> which are dedicated to further exploring character. These novels include the Private prequel collection, which focuses on various figures, and the spin-off series Privilege, which follows the resourceful but disturbed Ariana Osgood.|$|E

25|$|After {{she almost}} kisses Alfie, Kat nearly has sex with Max, but regrets it {{and goes to}} Alfie for comfort. The next day, she tells Alfie {{that she wants to}} get back {{together}} with him, but he tells her that he is not ready as {{he does not want to}} hurt her again. This causes Kat to reevaluate her life, so she visits the convent where she gave birth to Zoe to seek some answers, though it is now a nun's care home. A nun, Sister Ruth (June Whitfield), remembers her going into labour and they talk about <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> Kat then leaves and goes to the police station to make a statement about Harry. Ruth checks their records and discovers that Kat also gave birth to a son.

25|$|There {{are also}} many later {{stories of the}} origins of the Delphic Oracle. One late explanation, which is first related by the 1st century BC writer, Diodorus Siculus, tells of a goat herder named Coretas, who noticed one day that one of his goats, who fell into a crack in the earth, was {{behaving}} strangely. On entering the chasm, he found himself filled with a divine presence and could see outside of the present into <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> Excited by his discovery he shared it with nearby villagers. Many started visiting the site to experience the convulsions and inspirational trances, though some were said to disappear into the cleft due to their frenzied state. A shrine was erected at the site, where people began worshiping in the late Bronze Age, by 1600 BC. After the deaths of a number of men, the villagers chose a single young woman as the liaison for the divine inspirations. Eventually she spoke on behalf of gods.|$|E

His status in the band was initially thought to be temporary and for touring purposes only. Ray Luzier later announced at the Sabian show during NAMM that Welch would be joining Korn for the whole tour. Later in that month, techno artist Beta Traxx confirmed he was working on a new Korn song for their upcoming album, which he commented would sound [...] "like <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> at the same time." [...] It was also confirmed by Ray Luzier that Don Gilmore would be producing the upcoming album. On February 12, 2013, The BK Entertainment Group updated their clients list and confirmed that Korn has signed to their management's independent label; Prospect Park Productions. Later, On June 1, 2013 Caroline Records added Korn to their roster confirming that the band have been signed on to a contract with the label; they are partnered with Korn's management Prospect Park. On February 18, 2013, Korn posted a photo showing Head as part of the line up, which escalated rumors {{that he was in the}} process to rejoin Korn permanently. This {{was confirmed}} by Head himself in May, when it was also confirmed that he had been recording as part of the band for their upcoming album.|$|E

2500|$|Theoretical models may {{calculate}} the constants (coefficients) {{corresponding to the}} higher powers of T, but since {{it is impossible for}} a (finite) polynomial to match a periodic function over all numbers, the difference in all such approximations will grow without bound as T increases. However, greater accuracy can be obtained over a limited time span by fitting a high enough order polynomial to observation data, rather than a necessarily imperfect dynamic numerical model. So for present flight trajectory calculations of artificial satellites and spacecraft, the polynomial method gives better accuracy. [...] In that respect, the International Astronomical Union chose the best-developed available theory. For up to a few centuries in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> all formulas do not diverge very much. For up to a few thousand years in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> most agree to some accuracy. For eras farther out, discrepancies become too large – the exact rate and period of precession may not be computed using these polynomials even for a single whole precession period.|$|E

He then divides this long period into three eras: enlightenment wave of hope, revolutionary wave of hope and democratic wave of hope. Each of these waves is then discussed in detail.|$|E

'Patchy' isn't close to describing it." [...] In 2004, Rolling Stone called it [...] "the Byrds' most underrated album" [...] and especially admired [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] as [...] "the band's highest of highs, blending Coltrane-influenced 12-string squiggles with eerie harmonies for a truly hypnotic sound".|$|E

2500|$|Saving Hope: The Long Way to the Arab Spring (...) is a 2013 non-fiction book by Bahraini {{cultural}} critic Nader Kadhim. Written in Arabic, it is {{the ninth}} book by Kadhim, {{who works as a}} Professor of Cultural Studies at the University of Bahrain. Written in two stages, before and during the Arab Spring, the book discusses this wave of protests from two sides; <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> The past is divided into three waves, each of them corresponding to an era of hope and aspiration. First is the enlightenment wave, followed by the revolutionary wave and finally the democratic wave. The author then tackles the Arab Spring and argues {{that it is not the}} time for celebration, but an important station in the long way towards democracy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fundamental}} {{theme of}} the Book of Daniel is God's control over history. According to Deuteronomy 32:8-9 God assigned each nation its own divine patron; originally these were subordinate gods, {{but by the time}} Daniel came to be written they had been redefined as angels. In Daniel, Michael, the angel of Israel, is in battle with the [...] "prince (i.e., angelic patron) of Persia", and this will be followed by further battle with the [...] "prince of Greece"–the theological point being made is that the fate of nations is decided in heaven, not on earth. The same theme underlies the reference to the heavenly [...] "Book of Truth" [...] which is about to be revealed to Daniel, and which supposedly forms the content of chapter 11: both <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> are written already, and God is sovereign over all.|$|E

[...] This pitted him against the mainstream of his party, and also against Iorga. Despite shows of support from the Socialist Party benches and some PȚB deputies, Iorga suspended the session, accusing Stroescu of having [...] "insult all <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> of the nation"; he was supported in this by Marghiloman. In his diary, Iorga summarized the incident: [...] "Stroescu insulted from the rostrum this country as one of exploiters and awful clerks. I asked him to step down." ...|$|E
