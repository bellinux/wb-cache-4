5|$|Detachment Brandenstein {{attacked}} {{towns of}} Kotka and Lahti. The Red Guards' strong defence {{in the former}} stalled the Germans' plan, but they took over Lahti on 19–20 April. The German troops advanced from east-southeast; via Nastola, through Mustankallio graveyard in Salpausselkä and Russian garrisons of Hennala. The battle was mild, but strategically important as it cut connection between the western and eastern Red Guards. Fierce battles, in <b>the</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> the surrounding area broke out between 22 April and 2 May 1918, as several thousand western Red Guard and Red civilian refugees tried to push through Lahti {{on their way to}} Russia. The German troops were able to hold major parts of <b>the</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> halt the Red advance. Around 600 Reds and 80 German soldiers perished in the Lahti combats.
