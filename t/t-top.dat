25|$|The third {{generation}} Corvette, patterned after the Mako Shark II concept car, was introduced for the 1968 model {{year and was}} in production until 1982. C3 coupes featured the first use of <b>T-top</b> removable roof panels. It introduced monikers that were later revived, such as LT-1, ZR-1, Z07 and Collector Edition. In 1978, the Corvette's 25th anniversary was celebrated with a two-tone Silver Anniversary Edition and an Indy Pace Car replica edition of the C3. This {{was also the first}} time that a Corvette was used as a Pace Car for the Indianapolis 500.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Tik Tok" [...] was {{directed}} by Syndrome. It was shot in Kesha's old neighborhood and the car featured in the video belongs to her. Kesha explained the experience saying, [...] "the video I'm excited about because I actually got to shoot it in my old neighborhood and the guy driving my gold car {{is a friend of}} mine". The video's party scene was shot in her friend's house, which they refer to as the [...] "drunk tank". The singer said [...] "the last party scene is in this house called the drunk tank, which is one of my friend's houses that we all go party at. So I like it cause its super-honest and genuine." [...] The video begins with Kesha waking in a bathtub in a home as she stumbles out and begins to look for a toothbrush in the restroom. She makes her way down a staircase looking at the pictures lining the wall. Kesha makes her way to the kitchen and walks in on a family who are having breakfast, startling them. She shrugs and then leaves the home as the family gets up and follows her. When she arrives at the sidewalk, she picks up a gold bicycle lying against a fallen fence and rides off. Kesha meets a group of children and trades the bicycle for their boombox. The video cuts to another scene where she rejects a guy and is picked up by a man portrayed by Simon Rex who drives her in a gold 1978 Trans Am. They are pulled over by the police, who handcuff Kesha. The scene then pans to her singing while standing in the <b>T-top</b> as she dangles the handcuffs hanging from her left arm. The next scene shows Kesha in an empty room filled with glitter. She then attends a party with Rex for the final scene. The video comes to an end with Kesha lying in a different bathtub from the one she woke up in. The official music video has received over 360 million views on YouTube as of July 2017.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984 the Grand National {{returned}} in all black paint. [...] The turbocharged 3.8 L became standard and was refined with sequential fuel injection, distributor-less computer controlled ignition, and boasted [...] at 4400 rpm and [...] of torque at 2400 rpm. Only 5,204 Turbo Regals were produced that year, only 2000 {{of which were}} Grand Nationals. Because {{this was the first}} year production of the computer controlled [...] Sequential Fuel Injection and Distributor-less ignition, this is often considered the year/model that started the development of the legendary intercooled Grand Nationals. [...] The performance of this package was well ahead of its time and the “Little V6” easily kept up with the bigger V8’s. [...] Quarter mile (~400 m) performance was listed at 15.9 seconds at stock boost levels of , while for the same year, the Chevrolet Camaro was listed at 17.0 and the Chevrolet Corvette at 15.2 seconds. [...] Soon, performance enthusiasts determined the modifications that worked and the Grand Nationals easily broke into the 13-second territory. [...] All Grand Nationals for this year had the Lear Siegler-made cloth/leather interior which was only available for this year. [...] An estimated 200 of the 1984 Grand Nationals were produced with the <b>T-Top</b> option which makes these the rarest of the Grand Nationals.|$|E
50|$|Another {{first for}} 1978 was <b>T-Tops,</b> {{although}} they were a regular production option on the 1977 Pontiac Firebird and were introduced on the 1976 Pontiac Trans Am 10th Anniversary Limited Edition.|$|R
50|$|Only 2499 Cutlass Calais coupes were {{equipped}} with the Hurst/Olds W-30 package, featuring unique aluminum wheels trimmed with gold paint, an exclusive console-mounted Hurst Dual Gate floor shifter, special gold over black or white two-tone paint and an otherwise unavailable Oldsmobile 350 V8 with a four-barrel carb and dual outlet exhausts. It is estimated that only 537 cars with the H/O package had <b>T-Tops.</b>|$|R
50|$|The NX1600 {{was based}} on the {{standard}} 1.6L Sentra (engine code GA16DE), and the NX2000 {{was based on}} the 2.0 L SE-R model (engine code SR20DE). Most models were fitted with <b>T-Tops,</b> whilst others were hardtop. Constructed in Japan, was sold from 1991-1993 in the US (mainly competing with the Mazda MX-3, Isuzu Piazza, Toyota MR2, and Honda Civic Del Sol). Also, it was produced for a few more years and sold in other countries.|$|R
50|$|An {{improvement}} on the <b>T-top</b> cars was introduced mid year on all F-bodies. <b>T-top</b> cars now came with new seals which greatly reduced leaks {{into the passenger}} compartment.|$|E
50|$|A <b>T-top</b> (UK: T-bar) is an {{automobile}} roof with a removable panel {{on each side}} of a rigid bar running from the center of one structural bar between pillars {{to the center of the}} next structural bar.

5000|$|The RPO [...] "Y84" [...] Recaro Edition Trans Am or [...] "Recaro T/A", was revised for 1983. It was now {{built to}} the owner's tastes, {{including}} many more, or less options, and RPO [...] "Y81" [...] returned as the Recaro Edition Trans Am S/E without <b>T-Tops.</b> The LG4 was standard {{as was the}} WS6 package. The exterior remained virtually the same, except now the Firebird logo decals on the sail panels were replaced with Gold-plated Black and Gold Firebird Logo Medallions. The interior now featured Tan leather Recaro seats, carpeting, side panels, and the headliner.|$|R
50|$|The Nissan NX {{was also}} {{sold in the}} Japanese {{domestic}} market as the Nissan NX Coupe. Some models were fitted with <b>T-Tops,</b> whilst others were hardtop. The Japanese domestic NX Coupes came with either a 1.5 DOHC carburetted engine (GA15(DS)), a 1.6 DOHC EFI engine (GA16(DE)), a 1.8 DOHC EFI engine (SR18(DE)) or the rare 2.0 DOHC EFI engine (SR20DE).

All Japanese domestic models were fitted with electric windows, air conditioning, power steering, electric mirrors and central locking which locked the doors automatically at 18 km/h whilst driving, and was exclusive to Nissan Cherry Store Japanese dealerships.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in 1991, SLP (Street Legal Performance) {{modified}} a factory-built Formula {{into what}} they called the [...] "Firehawk". Once a Formula had been ordered or purchased, this limited-availability option (RPO code B4U) could be specified, and the vehicle was sent to SLP to be modified. No two cars SLP produced were alike; they all were special orders. SLP had anticipated making 250 of these special Firebird Formulas, but in fact, only 27 were ordered; and of those, only 25 were ever built (numbered 1-25 for hardtops - with numbers 18 and 23 never being built - and the only Firehawk Convertible was numbered 27 which was the only non-formula). Of those 25 Firehawks, 21 were [...] "Mandatory" [...] Red, 1 Aqua, 1 White, 1 Blue, and 1 Green; 11 had the Competition Package, 3 came with Aluminum Engine Blocks, 1 had <b>T-Tops,</b> and 1 was a Convertible.|$|R

5000|$|The 1968 Chevrolet Corvette coupe was {{the first}} U.S.-built {{production}} automobile to feature a <b>T-top</b> roof. [...] This increased {{the popularity of the}} coupe, such that it outsold the convertible and later led to the discontinuation of the Corvette convertible after 1975 until it was revived in 1986. Post-C3 models were built with a targa top instead of a <b>T-top.</b>|$|E

50|$|ASC {{continued}} to make Convertibles for Pontiac dealerships. A total of 330 Convertibles were reported by ASC. A portion of those were 350 powered Convertibles. NOTE: 1989 was the First year a US Dealership could order <b>T-top</b> and a 350 Engine in a firebird. Since all Convertibles started as a CC1 (<b>T-Top)</b> car and converted by ASC 1989 would also be the only year to get a 350 powered third generation Firebird convertible.|$|E
5000|$|Triumph Stag - has the {{underlying}} <b>T-Top</b> structure, {{but has a}} one piece, non-glass, roof panel which passes over the central front-to-back bar when in place.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>T-top</b> {{is a type}} of top for {{center console}} boats that is built with a [...] "T" [...] shaped {{structure}} when viewed from the side. The top is tall enough to stand under, and provides shade and rain protection for 2 or more passengers at the boat's helm. The <b>T-Top</b> is distinguished from other boat tops in that the entire structure is attached to the center console area, with no support brackets or straps connected to the outside of the boat, thereby providing 360-degree access around the boat for fishing and water activities.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "Vivio" [...] is a {{reference}} to the engine's displacement of 660 written in Roman numerals (VI,VI,O), and also inspired by the word [...] "vivid". It replaced the Rex that was introduced in the 1970s, and was itself superseded by the Subaru Pleo. It was available in 3 and 5-door versions commonly, with a two-door targa top version named <b>T-top</b> being available to special order from 1994. The <b>T-top</b> was built by Takada Kogyo, a convertible specialist who also assembled Nissan's Figaro and Silvia Varietta amongst other specialty cars.|$|E
50|$|In 1949, Buehrig joined Ford, {{where his}} {{projects}} included the 1951 Victoria Coupe and the 1956 Continental Mark II. He invented the removable <b>T-top,</b> patented 5 June 1951, {{which was used}} in the aborted TASCO sports car.|$|E
50|$|It {{has other}} {{features}} such as an optional <b>T-top</b> split roof, a spring-loaded hidden door for a side step into the cargo bed, and a spare tire mounted under the hood. The spare tire necessitates an oval shaped air intake breather.|$|E
50|$|The {{two main}} types of paracanoe boat are kayaks (K), with a double-blade paddle, and {{outrigger}} canoes called va'as (V) where the paddler has a second hull as a support float {{and uses a}} single blade paddle with a <b>T-top</b> handle.|$|E

50|$|The FORMULA was {{the only}} third Gen F-body to get to T-tops with a 350 Engine {{starting}} in MID year 1991 & 1992, to get a FORMULA 350 <b>T-top</b> car the black cross laced wheels (as installed on the Trans AM) were mandatory.|$|E
50|$|Stainless {{steel is}} also an {{optional}} material for <b>t-top</b> construction. It is much heavier, more difficult, and costly to build, and {{may not have the}} structural durability or flexibility of its aluminum counterpart. However, it is often seen to be much more attractive.|$|E
5000|$|... 2002 Collector's Edition Trans AmFor the Firebird's final year, a collector's edition Trans Am was {{released}} {{as either a}} yellow WS6 convertible or WS6 <b>t-top</b> coupe, with twin black stripes from hood to tail, black-painted five-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels, and further black-trimmed body details.|$|E
5000|$|... 1999 30th-Anniversary Trans AmAs {{with the}} {{previous}} 25th-anniversary edition, the 30th-anniversary edition was either a white WS6 convertible or WS6 <b>T-top</b> coupe, with twin dark blue stripes from hood to tail, and distinct blue anodized five-spoke 17-inch alloy A-mold wheels, with white leather seats and door trim.|$|E
50|$|Generally, t-tops are {{constructed}} {{from a high}} quality marine aluminum extrusion which is anodized for appearance longevity. The anodized aluminum extrusion requires a specific welding machine to assemble, usually a welding machine with pulse and square wave capacity. Marine extrusion is the lightest and most durable material for <b>t-top</b> construction.|$|E
5000|$|Targa and <b>T-top</b> {{numbers have}} slowly {{declined}} as manufacturers discontinued them {{in favour of}} full convertibles with retractable hardtops and folding metal roofs such as the Mercedes-Benz SLK, and by better structural engineering with pop-up roll over bars behind the seats and front roll-over bar incorporated into the front windscreen, ...|$|E
5000|$|Other changes {{included}} a Camaro convertible that was introduced {{for the first}} time since 1969 as a regular production option. Available on the Sport Coupe, LT and IROC-Z, the conversion was performed on <b>t-top</b> equipped Camaros by American Sunroof Company (ASC). A total 1,007 were produced in the first year of production. 1987 marked the 20th anniversary of the Camaro and the convertibles were considered the anniversary editions and {{included a}} dash badge that read [...] "20th Anniversary Commemorative Edition". Some 1987 <b>T-Top</b> models were made into convertibles by ASC after the customer took delivery. This is why there are some convertibles with the body VIN code of 2, meaning they were coupes, not convertibles (which have a body VIN code of 3). This was also the last year of production at GM's Norwood, OH facility as sales continued to decline consolidating Camaro assembly to the Van Nuys factory located in Southern California.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} Page desired an EDS-1275, {{they were no}} longer in {{production}} so he ordered a custom-made cherry 6/12. Page's EDS-1275 has a slightly different body shape from that of the current model. Page's also has one-piece mahogany necks rather than the current three-piece maple, and has tailpieces positioned {{near the bottom of the}} body, reportedly increasing sustain, and Patent No. or <b>T-Top</b> humbucking pickups.|$|E
50|$|Instead of {{the black}} Porsche 928 of the first game, the player {{commands}} a red example of the just-introduced (at the time) Nissan 300ZX Z32 <b>T-Top</b> Turbo. Unlike the first game, the player was able to fire at offending vehicles, with some cabinets containing buttons on the steering wheel, and others having a fire button on the gearshift, along with a button to activate the nitrous boost.|$|E
50|$|For the 1978 Eldorado {{model year}} only, 2,000 Eldorado Custom Biarritz Classics were {{produced}} in Two-Tone Arizona Beige/Demitasse Brown consisting of 1,499 with no Astroroofs or no Sunroofs; 475 with Astroroofs; 25 with Sunroofs and one (1) was produced with a Power Sliding <b>T-Top.</b> Only {{nine of the}} latter {{are known to have}} been retrofitted by the American Sunroof Company under the direction of General Motors' Cadillac Motor Division.|$|E
50|$|Due to its lighter {{weight and}} {{improved}} aerodynamics the Firebird Convertible was finally available through GM's normal ordering procedures. ASC still converted <b>T-top</b> cars into convertibles but the ordering process was simplified and dealers {{would no longer}} need to have the cars drop shipped to ASC in Michigan. The Convertibles were offered with one of three engine options: LHO 3.1L V6, the L03 5.0L V8 for the base Firebird, or the LB9 5.0L V8 Trans Am only.|$|E
