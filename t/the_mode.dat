5|$|The game's {{multiplayer}} received mixed reviews. Prell {{thought that}} the mission-design was varied, and the voting system kept <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> from being repetitive. He also praised the interconnected structure between the single-player and multiplayer, noting that the items that could be carried over from multiplayer to campaign made <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> feel rewarding for players. Reiner {{thought that the}} action featured in this mode is satisfying, but thought that the system lacked enough depth and complexity to engage players. Patterson echoed similar thoughts, and felt that the ability of players to switch between the campaign and the Chaos Squad mode made the multiplayer mode a rewarding experience. Brown criticized <b>the</b> <b>mode,</b> saying that its difficulty was not properly scaled.|$|E
5|$|World War I saw great {{changes in}} the use of cavalry. <b>The</b> <b>mode</b> of warfare changed, and the use of trench warfare, barbed wire and machine guns {{rendered}} traditional cavalry almost obsolete. Tanks, introduced in 1917, began to take over the role of shock combat.|$|E
50|$|When <b>the</b> two <b>modes</b> are unequal <b>the</b> larger <b>mode</b> {{is known}} as <b>the</b> major <b>mode</b> and <b>the</b> other as <b>the</b> minor <b>mode.</b> <b>The</b> least {{frequent}} value between <b>the</b> <b>modes</b> {{is known as}} the antimode. The difference between the major and minor modes {{is known as the}} amplitude. In time series <b>the</b> major <b>mode</b> is called <b>the</b> acrophase and the antimode the batiphase.|$|R
30|$|The IPEMU {{train was}} {{operated}} in two modes: <b>the</b> catenary <b>mode</b> and <b>the</b> catenary-free <b>mode.</b> During <b>the</b> catenary <b>mode,</b> <b>the</b> train would run under the overhead lines {{and use the}} power grid for both driving and charging the batteries. In <b>the</b> catenary-free <b>mode,</b> <b>the</b> train would operate without the connection to the power grid and by using only the batteries.

5|$|All of {{the fossil}} sites that have yielded Velociraptor remains {{preserve}} an arid environment with fields of sand dunes and only intermittent streams, although the younger Barun Goyot environment {{seems to have}} been slightly wetter than the older Djadochta. The posture of some complete fossils, as well as <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> of preservation most show within structureless sandstone deposits, may show that a number of specimens were buried alive during sandstorm events common to the three environments.|$|E
5|$|Although Kasuya did not {{explicitly}} define <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> of nutrition for A.coccinea, most Phallaceae species are suspected to be saprobic—decomposers {{of wood and}} plant organic matter. The fruit bodies of A.coccinea, known only from temperate regions of Japan (Tochigi Prefecture), grow solitarily or in groups on rice husks, straw, or dung. They are found from summer to autumn.|$|E
5|$|By late June , Donkey Kongs success had {{prompted}} {{more than}} 50 {{parties in the}} U.S. and Japan to license the game's characters. Mario and his simian nemesis appeared on cereal boxes, board games, pajamas, and manga. In 1983, the animation studio Ruby-Spears produced a Donkey Kong cartoon (as well as Donkey Kong Jr.) for the Saturday Supercade program on CBS. In the show, mystery crime-solving plots in <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> of Scooby-Doo are framed around the premise of Mario and Pauline chasing Donkey Kong (voiced by Soupy Sales), who has escaped from the circus. The show lasted two seasons.|$|E

5|$|Evolutionary {{biology is}} partly based on paleontology, which uses {{the fossil record}} to answer {{questions}} about <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> and tempo of evolution, and partly on the developments in areas such as population genetics. In the 1980s, developmental biology re-entered evolutionary biology after its initial exclusion from the modern synthesis through the study of evolutionary developmental biology. Phylogenetics, systematics, and taxonomy are related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology.|$|E
5|$|Hot Potato {{features}} seven {{missions and}} seven score challenges. Mission mode requires the player {{to clear out}} a set number of an alien species. There are multiple alien species in <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> and the mission does not finish until the player gets rid of enough of a certain species chosen by the game from the road. Score challenge mode tasks the player with clearing away {{a certain number of}} aliens in order to reach a pre-determined score. The game contains bonus levels which are longer than normal levels if the player is able to complete missions under a certain time period.|$|E
5|$|In WWE SmackDown vs. RAW 2008, GM Mode was {{combined}} into one game mode called WWE 24/7 Mode. This basically allowed Superstars to train, make special appearances or other actions between matches during full calendar years.

5|$|In {{between the}} Argo and the Trojan War, {{there was a}} {{generation}} known chiefly for its horrific crimes. This includes the doings of Atreus and Thyestes at Argos. Behind {{the myth of the}} house of Atreus (one of the two principal heroic dynasties with the house of Labdacus) lies the problem of the devolution of power and of <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> of accession to sovereignty. The twins Atreus and Thyestes with their descendants played the leading role in the tragedy of the devolution of power in Mycenae.|$|E
5|$|Indium is {{produced}} exclusively as a by-product during {{the processing of}} the ores of other metals. Its main source material are sulfidic zinc ores, where it is mostly hosted by sphalerite. Minor amounts are probably also extracted from sulfidic copper ores. During the roast-leach-electrowinning process of zinc smelting, indium accumulates in the iron-rich residues. From these, it can be extracted in different ways. It may also be recovered directly from the process solutions. Further purification is done by electrolysis. The exact process varies with <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> of operation of the smelter.|$|E
5|$|Its {{multiplayer}} {{features were}} praised; according to McCaffrey, the co-operative multiplayer mode had enough content {{for a separate}} game. Although he appreciated Spies vs. Mercs' faster pace, he found <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> less innovative than its predecessor. Reeves partially agreed, describing the revived Spies vs. Mercs mode as refreshing, intense, and bloody. De Matos wrote {{that it was one}} of the best multiplayer modes he had ever experienced, and the Blacklist version had evolved and modernized while remaining creative. Daniel Bloodworth of GameTrailers praised the game's satisfying co-op design, which tasks players to plan and coordinate strategy.|$|E
30|$|It {{is seen in}} Figure 1 {{that for}} the C̃-sequence, the square and product modes are {{accurately}} determined, whereas <b>the</b> original signal <b>modes</b> are often undetected at this SNR level. Moreover, {{it is found that}} <b>the</b> square <b>modes</b> are estimated with better accuracy than <b>the</b> product <b>modes.</b> Note that it is easy to identify and utilize <b>the</b> square <b>modes</b> of <b>the</b> signal for estimating <b>the</b> <b>modes</b> of <b>the</b> underlying signal. First the square-roots of all <b>the</b> estimated <b>modes</b> of <b>the</b> C̃-sequence are to be computed, then the complex amplitudes are to be estimated for all these computed <b>modes</b> utilizing <b>the</b> original signal sequence (Cadzow and Wu 1987). Selecting <b>the</b> original signal <b>modes</b> for M larger amplitudes will then be relatively straightforward. Note that in this way, <b>the</b> signal <b>modes</b> will be determined utilizing <b>the</b> square <b>modes</b> of <b>the</b> C̃-sequence. Thus, it should be the strategy that <b>the</b> <b>modes</b> of <b>the</b> underlying signal are to be determined utilizing the accurate estimates of <b>the</b> square <b>modes</b> of <b>the</b> C̃-sequence, because the estimates of <b>the</b> signal <b>modes</b> of <b>the</b> C̃-sequence may be inaccurate when the signal samples are corrupted with noise.|$|R

5|$|Messiaen used modes {{he called}} modes of limited transposition. They are {{distinguished}} as groups of notes {{that can only}} be transposed by a semitone a limited number of times. For example, the whole-tone scale (Messiaen's Mode 1) only exists in two transpositions: namely C–D–E–F–G–A and D–E–F–G–A–B. Messiaen abstracted these modes from the harmony of his improvisations and early works. Music written using the modes avoids conventional diatonic harmonic progressions, since for example Messiaen's Mode 2 (identical to the octatonic scale used also by other composers) permits precisely the dominant seventh chords whose tonic <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> does not contain.|$|E
5|$|Most puzzles {{are located}} on {{recognizable}} eye-level panels scattered around the island, often connected with power cables that light up once a puzzle is solved and guiding the player to the next puzzle. Some puzzles incorporate the game's architecture, such as one that requires the player to view background elements through a semi-transparent puzzle panel to determine the solution. There are also non-obvious puzzles built into the environment itself, requiring the player to find the correct vantage point to complete the puzzle. At any time, the player can engage the maze-drawing mode, which {{is marked by a}} white border on screen. While in this mode, the player's avatar is prevented from moving and instead allows the player to use their controls to trace the path through a presented maze. <b>The</b> <b>mode</b> ends once the player solves the puzzle or cancels <b>the</b> <b>mode.</b> Normally, this mode is activated in front of a panel, moving the player's view directly to the panel to solve it, {{but it can also be}} activated at any other time to engage those puzzles that are based on vantage points. Nearly all puzzles provide immediate feedback if they have been solved correctly or not through sound effects or visual indication.|$|E
30|$|Cat swarm {{optimization}} (CSO) {{algorithm is}} a computational intelligent algorithm, inspired from {{the behavior of}} cats. The CSO algorithm was introduced by Chu and Tsai (2006).

5|$|Neither treaty {{made any}} {{provision}} as to <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> or {{manner in which}} the removal of the Indians or surrender of the reservations was to take place. The grantees have assumed that they were authorized to take forcible possession of the two reservations, or of the four, as the case would have been under the first treaty.

5|$|Other {{defensive}} {{strategies are}} {{the use of}} camouflage, fleeing, and aggression. Some species have adopted colourings, shapes, and patterns that {{make it difficult for}} predators that hunt by sight to detect them. They tend to be dull shades of brown, grey, and green that blend into their background, and desert species tend to be pale. Some species can fly, but <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> of flight tends to be clumsy, so the most usual response to danger is to scuttle away to find a hiding place.|$|E
