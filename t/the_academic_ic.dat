40|$|This paper explores {{what types}} of {{intellectual}} capital (IC) information is referred to by sell-side analysts in their initiating coverage reports and how this information is embedded in analysts' valuation decision-making processes and justification of forecasts, valuations and recommendations. Empirical data is collected through the content analysis of 64 analysts' initiating coverage reports written on an equivalent number of companies included in the S&P/ASX 300 index. The content analysis {{is based on a}} categorisation scheme consisting of external, internal and human capital. The data analysis has benefited from both qualitative and quantitative attributes of content analysis. This study finds that sell-side analysts place greater importance on particular types of IC information over others, and several types of IC information are rarely or never used. At the same time IC plays a varying and broader role in analyst reports. IC is used to: (1) provide background information to understand the firm and its operations; (2) build the firm value creation story; (3) explain the strategies and methods of realising the value potential; (4) generate forecasts and valuations; (5) justify forecasts, valuations and recommendations; and (6) promote the firm as a good investment. The paper also reports: (1) inconsistency in the use of IC information; (2) lack of systematic analysis of IC information; and (3) an absence of any explicit references to key terminology used in <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> literature concerning <b>IC.</b> Practical implications - The findings of this study have implications for policy makers and professional associations in developing models and guidelines for reporting as well as analysing IC information and in re-evaluating current initiatives. Also, the findings may help curriculum development in organisations providing training and education for financial analysts and in planning continuous professional development programs for analysts. The paper addresses several unanswered questions on the importance of types of IC information to the capital market and the role of IC within the context of analysts' valuation decision-making processes...|$|R

40|$|As process {{technology}} continues to shrink, Integrated Circuits (ICs) can hold more memories on the chip to improve overall system performance, efficiency, and cost. Most <b>academic</b> <b>IC</b> design methodologies are inhibited by {{the availability of}} memory designs and timing characterizers. Many standard-cell Process Design Kits (PDKs) are available from vendors and foundries, but these PDKs do not come with any memory compilers or characterizers, while more expensive solutions only provide memory models with limited configurations and restrictive licenses. This thesis showcases OpenRAM, a characterization methodology and the author’s contributions. The author added the characterization methodology to OpenRAM {{to be able to}} generate timing and power characterizations through SPICE simulations. He also reorganized the memory modules and rewrote the low-level parameterized modules such as transistors and inverters. In addition, he ported and managed the unit and regression tests from SVN to git. Lastly, he improved and implemented multiple dynamically generated memory modules. The goal of OpenRAM is to promote academic research by providing a portable and flexible platform for the generation and verification of memory designs across various technologies, sizes, and components...|$|R
