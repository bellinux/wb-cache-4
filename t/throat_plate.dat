50|$|The {{main bar}} frames, 4+1/2 in thick, were {{machined}} from a 2 ft wide solid. The hind {{part of this}} frame was rigidly secured to the boiler through the high-pressure cylinder saddle castings and terminated {{just in front of}} the firebox outer <b>throat</b> <b>plate.</b> From this point rearwards, the frame was of the plate type and arranged to carry the spring gear and other fittings for the trailing Bissel truck.|$|E
50|$|Commonly {{known as}} the Hunslet Side Tanks, the {{locomotives}} had outside plate frames and used Walschaerts valve gear. The firebox was 3 ft long and, to obtain the required grate area, the width was extended to 4 ft at the foundation ring. To obtain a liberal firebox depth, the frames were opened out for some length at the rear end, with each frame constructed in two pieces which were connected by a cross strether {{in front of the}} firebox <b>throat</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
50|$|Unlike the {{original}} Class 12A boilers, initial and in-service repair cost considerations {{led to the}} Loubser boiler being built without a combustion chamber. The round-top firebox was radially stayed and the first two rows of stays were flexible. Similar stays were fitted in the side, back and <b>throat</b> <b>plates</b> and in the breaking zones. There were eight cross stays {{over the top of}} the firebox, which was of steel.|$|R

5000|$|The Class 10-2 {{saturated}} locomotives {{were similar}} to the Class 10, except that their boilers were arranged 7+7/8 in further forward and their firebox <b>throats</b> and back <b>plates</b> were sloped instead of being vertical. This modification brought the chimney {{in line with the}} cylinders and avoided a [...] "set" [...] in the blastpipe. The cylinders were arranged outside the plate frames. Like the Class 10, the locomotives had 62 in diameter coupled wheels, the largest yet used in South Africa at the time.|$|R
50|$|The hind end of {{the frame}} was {{redesigned}} and the bridle casting was removed and replaced by a frame plate, riveted to the main bar frame and carried through to the hind buffer beam. A new steel casting, extending across and over the main frame, added rigidity {{and served as a}} support for the boiler at the <b>throat</b> <b>plate.</b> A new design of drag box was installed. While the trailing Bissel truck remained unaltered, its side control was re-designed and a new compensating beam and support pivot was fitted.|$|E
50|$|The {{class had}} a {{reputation}} for being free steamers and strong pullers. Although they have a well-deserved reputation for their reliability, like any new class the W locos suffered some minor teething problems, including ashpan failures, and leaks in and around the foundation ring. The leaks were traced to faulty welding. The class suffered from stay failures in its early days, particularly in and around the <b>throat</b> <b>plate.</b> The first to fail was W913 in 1952. At one point, no less than 34 of the class were in Midland Railway Workshops or regional depots for stay repair. The problem was traced back to the thermic syphons creating significant water movement in the area, overstressing the boiler plates, as well as problems with the quality of the original stays. The syphons were progressively removed over a seven-year period, eliminating the problem.|$|E
5000|$|Male {{and female}} California sheepsheads have {{different}} color patterns and body shapes. [...] Males are larger, with black tail and head sections, wide, reddish orange midriffs, red eyes, and fleshy forehead bumps. Female sheephead are dull pink with white undersides. [...] Both sexes have white chins and large, protruding canine teeth that can pry hard-shelled animals from rocks. After powerful jaws and sharp teeth crush the prey, modified throat bones (a <b>throat</b> <b>plate)</b> grind the shells into small pieces. California sheephead can reach a size of 91 cm and a weight of 16 kg. [...] All sheepheads are born as females and eventually change to males at roughly 45 cm. [...] The {{age of the}} transition depends on environmental factors such as food supply. When supplied with {{a large amount of}} food, the California sheephead can live for up to 21 years. If food is scarce, they can live up to 9 years.|$|E
40|$|Heat {{exchanger}} is {{a device}} mediating {{the exchange of}} heat between two flowing mediums. This exchange can be periodical or continuous. The choice {{of the type of}} heat exchanger depends on the usage and parameters of entering medium. This thesis deals with the tube recuperation (recovery) exchanger and calculation of new one. This new heat exchanger is supposed to replace current one produced by Kralovopolska in 1974. These heat exchangers have wide range of application. They are widely used in all fields, from energy related equipment to the pharmaceutical plants. The conversion of current heat exchanger was made according to the CSN EN 13 445 for non-heated pressure vessels. The calculation was made for all pressure load parts, among these are the mantle, beds, <b>throats,</b> tube <b>plates</b> and tube feet. All parts are suitable for all the styles of load...|$|R
5000|$|The boiler, {{of which}} the barrel was 11/16 in thick, was fitted with four Ramsbottom safety valves, 3+1/2 in in diameter. It was fed by two injectors, {{arranged}} {{on the underside of}} the footplate at the sides, with the combination valves placed on the back of the firebox. The Belpaire firebox was constructed with a forward [...] "rake" [...] of the <b>throat</b> and back <b>plates</b> to keep the distance between the boiler's tube plates reasonably short at 18 ft. It had a finger bar firegrate which was operated by hand lever from the cab.|$|R
40|$|All Lancefield group C beta-hemolytic streptococci {{isolated}} over 12 {{months from}} college students with clinical pharyngitis and age-matched healthy controls were identified. Clinical features of {{upper respiratory tract}} infection and pyogenic pharyngitis as well as colony counts were tabulated for each patient according to throat culture results. Of 1, 480 patients, Lancefield group C Streptococcus equisimilis was isolated from 45 (3 %) patients and Streptococcus anginosus ("Streptococcus milleri") was isolated from 164 (11. 1 %) patients. Patients from whom S. equisimilis was isolated had clinical features more suggestive of pyogenic infection than did patients from whom S. anginosus was isolated. Colony counts on primary <b>throat</b> culture <b>plates</b> from patients from whom S. equisimilis and Streptococcus pyogenes were isolated were higher than those from patients from whom S. anginosus was isolated. This study presents epidemiologic evidence supporting a role for S. equisimilis in causing pharyngeal infection and for S. anginosus as representing part of the normal oropharyngeal flora...|$|R
40|$|The {{penetration}} force of sewing needle {{has been estimated}} using fabric properties. The {{penetration force}} was measured by Simple Compression Tester with a sewing needle and a specimen holder attached to it. Many kinds of woven fabrics were used and the needle diameters were varied four times. As a result, the penetration force, W_ increases exponentially with r/R (r; the radius of needle blade, R; the radius of <b>throat</b> <b>plate</b> hole), which is shown by a following formula; W_ =K(r/R) ^n. While n is constant; n= 3, K depends on the sample fabrics and is estimated from the fabric property value, X_i, using the following formula, K=C・X_ 1 ^ ・X_ 2 ^ ・X_ 3 ^ …X_i^. C and a_i are constant, and a_i is determined by X_i. The formula was derived by the stepwise residual regression method. X_i is determined on the four fabric properties of shear stiffness, weave density, weight and compression energy. The exponential coefficient of shear stiffness is {{the largest of the}} four properties and shear stiffness affects greatly the penetration force of sewing needles. The values of the penetration force calculated using the formula agreed well with those measured in this experiment...|$|E
40|$|A two-disk {{system is}} {{described}} which allows primary plate identification of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci could be visualized on primary <b>throat</b> culture <b>plates</b> by using trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to inhibit normal flora. In the heavily inoculated area of Trypticase soy agar plates containing 5 % sheep blood, a 25 -microgram/ml trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole disk was placed contiguous to a 0. 04 -U bacitracin disk. A total of 259 throat specimens were examined with this two-disk system. The swabs from these throat specimens were incubated in Todd-Hewitt broth. The bacterial pellet from the broths was stained by fluorescent antibody as a control. Of the cultures that {{were determined to}} be positive on the plates, 75 % could be read unequivocally after overnight incubation, whereas the remaining 25 % required subculture. The plates recovered 91 % of the cultures which were considered as true positives by the broth-fluorescent-antibody technique. This method provided a significant savings in time compared with standard plate methods and in cost of materials compared with broth-fluorescent-antibody methods. This technique is particularly valuable for producing rapid results in laboratories where fluorescence microscopy would not be cost-effective...|$|R
5000|$|In the High Middle Ages, when mail was {{the primary}} form of metal body armor used in Western Europe, the Mail coif {{protected}} the neck and lower face. During the 14th century as more plate armor appeared to supplement mail, the Bascinet helmet incorporated a mail curtain called the Aventail which protected the lower face, neck and shoulders. A separate mail collar called a [...] "pisan" [...] or [...] "standard" [...] was sometimes worn under the aventail as additional protection. Towards {{the end of the}} 14th century, threats including the increased penetrating power of the lance when paired with a lance rest on the breastplate made more rigid forms of neck protection desirable. One solution was a standing collar plate worn over the aventail and separate from the helmet, which was wide enough for the helmet to move around in so that the man-at-arms could turn his head. Through the early 15th century, gorget plates were integrated into the helmet itself to form the great bascinet. Other forms of helmet such as the sallet which did not protect the lower face and <b>throat</b> with <b>plate</b> were paired with a separate bevor, and the armet was often fitted with a wrapper that included gorget lames protecting the throat. During this time, the mail standard was still used.|$|R
5000|$|Ten heavy Pacific {{passenger}} locomotives, {{designed by}} CSAR Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) G.G. Elliot based on Hyde’s Class 10 design, were ordered from NBL and delivered in 1910. They had plate frames, Belpaire fireboxes and Walschaerts valve gear and were delivered in two variants, {{five of them}} using saturated steam while the rest were superheated. While similar to the Class 10, their boilers were arranged further forwards, their firebox <b>throats</b> and back <b>plates</b> were sloped instead of being vertical, they used inside admission piston valves and their valve gear was reversed {{by means of a}} vertical steam reversing engine mounted on the right-hand running board. They were all classified as Class 10-2 by the CSAR but, in 1912, the SAR designated the saturated steam locomotives Class 10A and the superheated ones Class 10B. A further five superheated Class 10B locomotives were delivered to the SAR from Beyer, Peacock in 1912.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The assessment of drug formulations delivered by the pressurised metered dose inhaler and used {{in the treatment of}} Asthma are assessed commercially using cascade impactors which are the preferred instruments for the assessment of particle size and respirable mass or fraction delivered by inhalation devices. The fundamental principle underpinning the design of cascade impactors is particle motion defined by Stokes theory. The analysis of impactor data raises a number of functional issues as calibration curves have long tails, which are not easily explained by a simplistic application of Stokes law. The atomisation process, propellant flashing, evaporation and aerodynamic properties of the residual drug particle detennine the distribution of the drug particles within the lung and resultant therapeutic effect. The research uses mathematical modelling and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to evaluate the flow and inertial deposition in the USP <b>throat</b> and the <b>plates</b> of the ACI which is the most widely used cascade impactor. The CFD analysis shows the flow in the outlet section of the USP throat to be unstable for the basic design, when coupled to an outlet extension and when coupled to the ACI via the standard coupler and first jet stage. The modelling also provides insight as to why the calibration curves of the ACI have long tails and reveals a number of issues with the design of the ACI coupler and the fundamental design of impactor jet arrays as well as the position and functional response of upper impactor plates. Additional particle sizing methodologies were used to assess the lognonnal characteristics of the atomised droplets and residual drug particles. The experimental data was compared to current atomisation model and modification recommended and a proposed alternative model with improved fit to the data...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{functional}} requirement of a structural detail brackets {{with and without}} scallop are frequently used in bridges, decks, ships and offshore structure. Scallops are designed to serve as passage way for fluids, to reduce weld length and plate distortions. Moreover, scallops are used to avoid intersection {{of two or more}} welds for {{the fact that there is}} the presence of inventible inherent initial crack except for full penetrated weld and the formation of multi-axial stress state at the weld intersection. Welding all around the scallop corner increase the possibility of brittle fracture even for the case the bracket is not loaded by primary load. Avoiding of scallop will establish an initial crack in the corner if bracket is welded by fillet welds. If the two weld run pass had crossed, this would have given a 3 D residual stress situation. Therefore the presences and absence of scallop necessitates the 3 D FEA fatigue resistance of both types of brackets using effective notch stress approach (). FEMAP 10. 1 with NX NASTRAN was used for the 3 D FEA. The first and main objective of this research was to investigate and compare the fatigue resistance of brackets with and without scallop. The secondary goal was the fatigue design of scallops in case they cannot be avoided for some reason. The fatigue resistance for both types of brackets was determined based on approach using 1 mm fictitiously rounded radius based on IIW recommendation. Identical geometrical, boundary and loading conditions were used for the determination and comparison of fatigue resistance of both types of brackets using linear 3 D FEA. Moreover the size effect of bracket length was also studied using 2 D SHELL element FEA. In the case of brackets with scallop the flange plate weld toe at the corner of the scallop was found to exhibit the highest and made the flange plate weld toe critical for fatigue failure. Whereas weld root and weld toe at the weld intersections were the highly stressed location for brackets without scallop. Thus weld toe for brackets with scallop, and weld root and weld toe for brackets without scallop were found to be the critical area for fatigue failure. Employing identical parameters on both types of brackets, brackets without scallop had the highest except for full penetrated weld. Furthermore the fatigue resistance of brackets without scallop was highly affected by the lack of weld penetration length and it was found out that decreased as the weld penetration was increased. Despite the fact that the very presence of scallop reduces the stiffness and also same time induce stress concentration, based on the 3 D FEA it is worth concluding that using scallop provided better fatigue resistance when both types of brackets were fillet welded. However brackets without scallop had the highest fatigue resistance when full penetration weld was used. This thesis also showed that weld toe for brackets with scallop was the only highly stressed area unlike brackets without scallop in which both weld toe and weld root were the critical locations for fatigue failure when different types of boundary conditions were used. Weld <b>throat</b> thickness, <b>plate</b> thickness, scallop radius, lack of weld penetration length, boundary condition and weld quality affected the fatigue resistance of both types of brackets. And as a result, bracket design procedure, especially welding quality and post weld treatment techniques significantly affect the fatigue resistance of both type of brackets...|$|R
