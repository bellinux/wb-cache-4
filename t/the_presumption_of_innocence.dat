Research Objectives 1. to identify and analyze the policy on formulation of protection of rights of accused terrorists in the line with <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence</b> in criminal judicial system. 2. To identify and analyze the policy on formulation of procedures of treating accused terrorists in the line with <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence</b> in criminal judicial system. It was a juridicial normative research with qualitative analysis. Research Finding : The formulation of protection of rights of accused terrorists is normatifvely provided in the Criminal Codes and Law of Terrorism Combat. The policy on formulation of protection of the rights of accused terrorists in those two laws is not yet fully harmonious since in the Law of Terrorism Combat there is a provision inconsistent with the principles of proof provided in the Criminal Codes. However, the rest is in general in coherence with <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence.</b> <b>The</b> policy on formulation of procedures of treating accused terrorists is already consistent with the principle of protection to the rights of accused terrorists in compliance the Criminal Codes and Law of Terrorism Combat. The policy on formulation of procedures of treating accused terrorists is normatively consistent with <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence.</b> However, in their implementations, there were still technical obstacles due to some diffrent perceptions in understanding the provisions concerning with treatment to accused terrorists by the legal enforcers...|$|R

However, these rights were not respected in practice. While some judges allowed public access to trials, other judges, notably those presiding in rape trials, did not. There are no juries. Defendants have the right to appeal most cases except those involving national security, armed robbery, and smuggling, which the Court of State Security generally adjudicates. In some instances special military tribunals, whose jurisdiction is ill defined, adjudicate national security cases. The law provides for court-appointed counsel at state expense in certain cases, but the government often did not provide such counsel.|$|E

Also, the Court held that such a defendant has a right to having {{a significant}} defense.

Many of these rights were also included in the Canadian Bill of Rights, which the Canadian Parliament enacted in 1960. However, the Canadian Bill of Rights had a number of shortcomings. Unlike the Charter, it was an ordinary Act of Parliament, which could be amended by a simple majority of Parliament, and it was applicable only to the federal government. The courts also chose to interpret the Bill of Rights conservatively, only on rare occasions applying it to find a contrary law inoperative.

It was this view of traditional law as a punitive instrument rather than a means of mediating disputes that was presented to the Europeans codifying these laws. It was also the view of traditional law in Malawi that inspired both the then-Prime Minister, Banda, and the Minister of Justice Orton Chirwa to criticise such principles of English-based law as <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence,</b> the need to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt and the requirement for corroborating evidence. By 1969, Aleke Banda, the Minister of Finance, openly attacked the use of defence lawyers and the safeguards or restrictions imposed by the English-law Rules of evidence. Dr Banda specifically linked traditional law to punishment, and claimed that lack of evidence was not proof of innocence.|$|E

25|$|Baron de Montesquieu wrote {{a series}} of highly {{influential}} works in the early 18th century, including Persian letters (1717) and The Spirit of the Laws (1748). The latter exerted tremendous influence, {{both inside and outside}} France. Montesquieu pleaded in favor of a constitutional system of government, the preservation of civil liberties and the law, and the idea that political institutions ought to reflect the social and geographical aspects of each community. In particular, he argued that political liberty required the separation of the powers of government. Building on John Locke's Second Treatise of Government, he advocated that the executive, legislative, and judicial functions of government should be assigned to different bodies, so that attempts by one branch of government to infringe on political liberty might be restrained by the other branches. In a lengthy discussion of the English political system, which he greatly admired, he tried to show how this might be achieved and liberty secured, even in a monarchy. He also notes that liberty cannot be secure where there is no separation of powers, even in a republic. He also emphasized the importance of a robust due process in law, including the right to a fair trial, <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence</b> and proportionality in the severity of punishment.|$|E

As part of the renewed application, permission to reopen the original judicial review application was seeked and granted by Ouseley J. The August 2016 application {{took the form of}} an {{application for}} permission to amend the grounds of the July 2015 judicial review claim. Three additional grounds for review were seeked by Rahman. The first two grounds rely on Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights arguing that the election court findings are incompatible with <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence</b> and right to a fair trial, given the subsequent decision of the Metropolitan Police. Permission for those two grounds were rejected by the divisional court with the findings that Rahman was at no point charged with a criminal offence for the purpose of Article 6, and that there were no parallel criminal proceedings alongside civil proceedings of the election court. Permission to include the second ground was additionally denied on the basis of undue delay in raising the issue by Rahman. Under the third ground, Rahman seeked a declaratory judgment that the Metropolitan Police decision to discontinue criminal investigation into him constituted an acquittal, and thus triggering the power of a court to order the cessation of the incapacity previously imposed by the election court judgment. Permission was denied based on the earlier finding that Rahman had not been charged, and thus impossible to have been acquitted on a prosecution.|$|E
25|$|Reacting to {{fears of}} {{communist}} subversion, Bennett invoked the controversial Section 98 of the Criminal Code. Enacted {{in the aftermath}} of the Winnipeg general strike, section 98 dispensed with <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence</b> in outlawing potential threats to the state: specifically, anyone belonging to an organization that officially advocated the violent overthrow of the government. Even if the accused had never committed an act of violence or personally supported such an action, they could be incarcerated merely for attending meetings of such an organization, publicly speaking in its defense, or distributing its literature. Despite the broad power authorized under section 98, it targeted specifically the Communist Party of Canada. Eight of the top party leaders, including Tim Buck, were arrested on 11 August 1931 and convicted under section 98. This plan to stamp out communism backfired, however, and proved to be a damaging embarrassment for the government, especially after Buck was the target of an apparent assassination attempt. While confined to his cell during a prison riot, despite not participating in the riot, shots were fired into his cell. When an agit-prop play depicting these events, Eight Men Speak, was suppressed on 4 December 1933 by the Toronto police, a protest meeting was held where Communist politician A. E. Smith repeated the play's allegations, and he was consequently arrested for sedition. This created a storm of public protest, compounded when Buck was called as a witness to the trial and repeated the allegations in open court. Although the remarks were stricken from the record, they still discredited the prosecution's case and Smith was acquitted. As a result, the government's case against Buck lost any credibility, and Buck and his comrades were released early and fêted as heroic champions of civil liberties.|$|E
