5|$|The Kashi Vishwanath Temple, on the Ganges, {{is one of}} the 12 Jyotirlinga Shiva temples in Varanasi. <b>The</b> <b>temple</b> {{has been}} {{destroyed}} and rebuilt several times throughout its existence. The Gyanvapi Mosque, which is adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>temple,</b> is the original site of <b>the</b> <b>temple.</b> <b>The</b> <b>temple,</b> which is also known as the Golden Temple, was built in 1780 by Queen Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore. The two pinnacles of <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> are covered in gold and were donated in 1839 by Ranjit Singh, the ruler of Punjab. The dome is scheduled to receive gold plating through a proposed initiative of the Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs of Uttar Pradesh.

5|$|The wall {{surrounding}} <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> {{was formerly}} {{part of a}} city wall that surrounded Quyang. The south gate of <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> once served {{as one of the}} main gates for the town. Apart from the remnant that is part of <b>the</b> <b>temple,</b> nothing more survives of this wall. <b>The</b> <b>temple</b> grounds are also home to over 137 stelae, dating from the Northern Wei Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} temples built on Capitoline hill: <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> of Juno Moneta, <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> of Virtus, and <b>the</b> <b>Temple</b> of Jupiter Optimus Maximus Capitolinus. <b>The</b> <b>Temple</b> of Jupiter Optimus Maximus Capitolinus {{is the most}} important of the temples. It was built in 509 BC and was nearly as large as the Parthenon. The hill and <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> of Jupiter became the symbols of Rome, the capital of the world.|$|E

5|$|Once {{a part of}} the Chola kingdom, Tiruchirappalli has {{a number}} of exquisitely sculpted temples and fortresses. Most of <b>the</b> <b>temples,</b> {{including}} <b>the</b> Rockfort <b>temples,</b> <b>the</b> Ranganathaswamy <b>Temple</b> at Srirangam, <b>the</b> Jambukeswarar <b>Temple</b> at Thiruvanaikkaval, <b>the</b> Samayapuram Mariamman <b>Temple,</b> <b>the</b> Erumbeeswarar <b>Temple,</b> Ukrakaliamman temple in Tennur and <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> in Urayur, are built in the Dravidian style of architecture; <b>the</b> Ranganathaswamy <b>Temple</b> and Jambukeswarar Temple are often counted among the best examples of this style. <b>The</b> rock-cut cave <b>temples</b> of <b>the</b> Rockfort, along with the gateway and <b>the</b> Erumbeeswarar <b>Temple,</b> are listed as monuments of national importance by the Archaeological Survey of India.|$|R
50|$|Center of the City of Zion — Latter Day Saints often view temples {{as central}} to the {{establishment}} of Zionic communities.

5|$|A Chola {{inscription}} {{indicates an}} endowment to the shrines of Krishna (an avatar of Vishnu) and his consort Rukmini inside <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> by King Parakesarivarman (907-955 AD). <b>The</b> <b>temple</b> had later additions from the subsequent Chola, later Pandyas, Hoysala and the Vijayanagara kings. <b>The</b> <b>temple</b> suffered extensive damage during a flood and was repaired by a merchant around 1262–63.|$|E
5|$|A large mound on {{the south}} side of the plaza was once <b>the</b> <b>Temple</b> of Jakawitz, a deity of the {{mountains}} and the patron of the Ajaw K'iche' lineage. Like the other structures of Q'umarkaj, all the stone facing has been robbed, leaving only a rubble and mud core. This structure was part of a complex that consisted of a patio enclosed by <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> on the northern side, a palace {{on the south}}ern side and a long building on the east. The Jakawitz complex has not been investigated archaeologically. Drawings by Rivera y Maestre suggest that <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> was a narrow building with four or five terraces.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of 'inscription stones' {{collected}} by King Bodawpaya are {{seen in a long}} gallery in the southeastern corner of <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> courtyard. These inscriptions, some of which are made from gilded marble and sandstone, have been collected from many regions of the country. There is also a large water tank in the southeast direction of <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> where fish and turtles are fed with rice cakes by the {{large number of}} pilgrims who visit <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> every day. Adjacent to the Buddha temple is the Mahamuni Museum, which contains displays of Buddhism throughout Asia.|$|E
50|$|Jyothirlinga Group, at a short {{distance}} to the southwest of Ravalaphadi, is <b>the</b> group of <b>temples</b> called Jothirlinga group. Two small temples here are flat roofed {{and in front of}} them are Nandimantapas. <b>The</b> remaining <b>temples</b> have a sanctum, shukanasa and a front hall in each of <b>the</b> <b>temples.</b> Two of <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> have Kadambanagara towers. Two of <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> have inscriptions of the Kalyana Chalukya period. The rest of <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> now dilapidated are of about the 8th to 10th centuries.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> ancient <b>temples</b> in Arang, {{which are}} tourist attractions are: <b>the</b> Baghdeval <b>temple,</b> <b>the</b> Bhanda Dewal <b>temple,</b> <b>the</b> Mahamaya <b>temple,</b> <b>the</b> Danteshwari <b>temple,</b> <b>the</b> Chandi Maheshwari <b>temple,</b> <b>the</b> Panchmukhi Mahadev <b>temple,</b> and <b>the</b> Panchmukhi Hanuman <b>temple.</b> Of these, <b>the</b> Bhand Dewal <b>temple</b> and Bagh Deval temple are {{particularly}} ancient and well-known. Recently an idol of Adinath (Rishabhnatha) was excavated near this temple. This idol is 1.16 m in height, 37 cm in width and 21 cm in thickness. This standing sculpture has a Yaksha and Yakshini near its knee region on two sides. The sculpture is dated to 5th-6th centuries AD.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Swayambhu Shiv <b>Temple,</b> <b>the</b> Ganesha <b>Temple,</b> <b>the</b> Mauli <b>Temple,</b> <b>the</b> Rampurush <b>Temple</b> and <b>the</b> Navadurga <b>Temple</b> - where Goddess Durga is worshipped - {{are some}} of the many {{religious}} shrines this place is specked with. The Yashwantgad Fort, Shiroda, Aravali and the Terekhol Fort are a few historic monuments that are worth a visit.|$|R
5|$|Access to <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> {{was located}} in the {{south-east}} corner of the enclosure wall. The entrance led to an open courtyard that stretched from east to west. The ritual cleaning and preparation of the offerings took place here. Because of the extensive degradation suffered by <b>the</b> <b>temple,</b> reconstruction attempts are somewhat speculative. From the ruins, archaeologists propose that <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> comprised an open colonnade, possibly made of granite, a sacrificial chapel adjoining the pyramid side, three statue niches and a few magazine chambers. No traces of a cult pyramid were found onsite. In the halls of <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> were depictions of animal processions and offerings carriers moving towards the Shrine of the Queen.|$|E
5|$|According to eyewitnesses, on 23 May 2015 {{the militants}} {{destroyed}} the Lion of Al-lāt and other statues; this came {{days after the}} militants gathered the citizens and promised not to destroy the city's monuments. ISIL destroyed <b>the</b> <b>Temple</b> of Baalshamin on 23 August 2015 according to Syria's antiquities chief Maamoun Abdulkarim and activists. On 30 August 2015, ISIL destroyed the cella of <b>the</b> <b>Temple</b> of Bel. On 31 August 2015, the United Nations confirmed <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> was destroyed; the temple's exterior walls and entrance arch remain.|$|E
5|$|According to the Dalai Lama, {{among the}} many images in <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> was an image of Chenrizi, made of clay in <b>the</b> <b>temple,</b> within which the small wooden statue of the Buddha brought from Nepal was hidden. The image was in <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> for 1300 years, and when Songtsen Gampo died his soul was {{believed}} to have entered the small wooden statue. During the Cultural Revolution, the clay image was smashed and the smaller Buddha was given by a Tibetan to the Dalai Lama.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>temples</b> of Ramakrishna {{are called}} <b>the</b> Universal <b>Temples.</b> <b>The</b> first Universal <b>temple</b> was built at Belur, {{which is the}} {{headquarters}} of the Ramakrishna Mission.|$|R
50|$|The {{plan and}} design of <b>the</b> Adinatha <b>temple</b> {{is similar to that}} of <b>the</b> Vamana <b>temple.</b> There are only a few {{differences}} between <b>the</b> two <b>temples.</b> For example, <b>the</b> top row of the outer wall of <b>the</b> Adinatha <b>temple</b> depicts a flying vidyadhara, while that of <b>the</b> Vamana <b>temple</b> shows diamond-shaped decorations. The curvilinear tower of <b>the</b> Adinatha <b>temple</b> is of better proportions than that of <b>the</b> Vamana <b>temple.</b> This, combined with a somewhat more evolved sculptural style, suggests that <b>the</b> Adinatha <b>temple</b> was constructed after <b>the</b> Vamana <b>temple.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>temples</b> {{close at}} around 11 am. Since <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> are in Satpura Mountain range and {{surrounded}} by jungle, {{it is better to}} visit <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> before 10 am. It takes around 1.25 to 1.5 hour for an average person to finish the entire upward and downward journeys and also little bit of puja in each temple. After 11am, one can not go inside <b>the</b> <b>temples.</b> One has to greet the Bhagwans from outside the door of each temple.|$|R
5|$|According to {{the chronicle}} Madala Panji, in 318 AD, the priests and servitors of <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> {{spirited}} away the idols {{to escape the}} wrath of the Rashtrakuta king Rakatavahu. In the temple's historical records it finds mention in the Brahma Purana and Skanda Purana stating that <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> was built by the king Indradyumna, Ujjayani.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the local}} legend, <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> was built by Vontudu and Mittudu, who were robbers-turned-devotees of Rama. After {{building}} <b>the</b> <b>temple,</b> {{they are said to}} have turned into stone.|$|E
5|$|Alauddin Khalji sent an army under Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan, who {{dismantled}} <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> {{complex in}} 1296 AD (Samvat 1353). <b>The</b> <b>temple</b> was further destroyed {{and the western}} part of it was converted into congregational mosque (Jami Mosque) by Ahmed Shah I (1410–44) of Muzaffarid dynasty in 1414 or 1415.|$|E
50|$|The Vaibava Malai also {{states that}} the Portuguese after the {{annexation}} of Jaffna, in their religious zeal destroyed all <b>the</b> Hindu <b>temples</b> in <b>the</b> Kingdom. It adds that in deference to Paranirupasinghe they did not destroy <b>the</b> great <b>temple</b> at Nallur nor those <b>temples</b> in <b>the</b> vicinity of Keerimalai. Tradition has it that <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> they spared were: <b>the</b> Mavittapuram Kandasamy <b>temple,</b> <b>the</b> Paralai Kandasami <b>temple,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> of Mathakal including the Pillayar Kovil in Kanji. Once again one could understand why they spared Nallur <b>the</b> premier <b>temple.</b> However it is intriguing {{as to why they}} spared <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> in <b>the</b> vicinity of Keerimalai. It is not implausible to surmise that this area was of special significance to Paranirupasinghe.|$|R
50|$|Excavations at Tell el-Dab’a have {{uncovered}} temples that {{date to the}} Hyksos period. <b>The</b> <b>temples</b> exhibit Egyptian and Canaanite styles. By convention, the entrances of <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> are in <b>the</b> north wall and <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> are orientated NNW-SSE. Items such as bronze daggers, ax heads, and jugs have been found at these complexes.|$|R
5000|$|Guangxiao {{originated}} from {{the residence of}} Zhao Jiande, the king of Nanyue whose usurpation prompted Emperor Wu of the Han to invade and annex the area. During the Three Kingdoms, the Wu officer and scholar Yu Fan (...) was banished to live at the residence. After Yu Fan died in 233, his family donated the estate, whose grounds were organized as <b>the</b> Zhizhi <b>Temple.</b> It was repeatedly renamed: <b>the</b> Wangyuanchaoyan <b>Temple,</b> <b>the</b> Wangyuan <b>Temple,</b> <b>the</b> Qianmingfaxing <b>Temple,</b> <b>the</b> Chongningwanshou <b>Temple,</b> and <b>the</b> Baoenguangxiaochan <b>Temple.</b>|$|R
5|$|Angkor Wat, {{located at}} , {{is a unique}} {{combination}} of <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> mountain (the standard design for the empire's state temples) and the later plan of concentric galleries. <b>The</b> <b>temple</b> is a representation of Mount Meru, {{the home of the}} gods: the central quincunx of towers symbolises the five peaks of the mountain, and the walls and moat symbolise the surrounding mountain ranges and ocean. Access to the upper areas of <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> was progressively more exclusive, with the laity being admitted only to the lowest level.|$|E
5|$|Another {{location}} in the city used for large productions is the Hamasa Shrine Temple Theater. <b>The</b> <b>Temple</b> Theater houses a 778-pipe Robert Morgan organ, one of two Theater Organs still in their original installations in the state. With seating for 1800 persons, the silent movie era was a prosperous time for <b>the</b> <b>Temple.</b> At the time, {{it was one of}} the largest stages in the United States, second only to the Roxy Theater in New York City. Today, seating 1576 persons, <b>the</b> <b>Temple</b> is used year-round for area events, live stage shows, plays, concerts, Hamasa Shrine functions, and public screenings of classic movies.|$|E
5|$|Another myth current amongst Tamils {{says that}} <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> was {{renovate}}d by a legendary Chola king, Kullakotan. According to that myth, the king, who was afflicted with an incurable skin disease, was cured {{after taking a}} bath in the ruined temple’s holy pond. Following the miracle, the king went on to renovate <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> and created a community of temple caretakers to maintain <b>the</b> <b>temple.</b> The equivalent myth amongst the Sinhalese people indicates that the diseased king was Rajasinghe or Bhuvanekabahu and the king prayed to the presiding goddess who cured him of his affliction. There were at least two kings called Rajasinghe in Sri Lanka, {{and both of them}} were involved in the actual renovations of <b>the</b> <b>temple,</b> and at least seven kings named Bhuvanekabahu, thereby making it difficult to identify the right king.|$|E
5000|$|According to Qingyuan County Annals, <b>the</b> Feilai <b>Temple</b> {{includes}} <b>the</b> following halls: <b>the</b> Guangqing <b>Temple</b> (...) , <b>the</b> Feilai <b>Temple</b> (...) , <b>the</b> Dizi Ancestral Hall (...) , the Sixth Patriarch Hall (...) , and the Guanyin Hall.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>temples</b> {{have been}} {{decorated}} with sculptures of episodes from the epic Mahabharata and Ramayana, {{and the fight}} between Durga and Mahishasura. Scenes of village life are also carved at some locations of <b>the</b> <b>temples.</b> There are a few inscriptions also on <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> which give details of building of <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> and also on the socio-political history of that period. These are inscribed and dated as [...] "shaka era" [...] (Indian national calendar), in early Bengali script which {{is a combination of}} Sanskrit, Prakrit and Bengali.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Sree Chamundesari <b>temple</b> is just {{adjacent}} to <b>the</b> Mahadevar <b>temple.</b> Though <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> are under Devaswam board, <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> are maintained by a best trust called Kuzhithurai Sree Mahadevar Shektra Samrakshna Samithi; {{with the help}} of devotees of this surrounding area the committee has spent a huge amount for the renovation of <b>the</b> <b>temples.</b> A large number of devotees from Kanyakumari and Trivadrum District visit Sree Chamundeswari Temple for special poojas, especially unmarried girls for a good marriage life.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Syrian Civil War, {{excavations}} stopped, and the site came under the control of armed gangs, and witnessed a large scale looting. An official report revealed that the robbers are focusing on the royal palace, the public baths, <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> of Ishtar and <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> of Dagan.|$|E
5|$|As {{indicated}} in <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> records, the priests of <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> were Shiva ascetics called Dandi Sanyasis, {{who belonged to}} Nambudiri community, a religious group common in modern Kerala. When {{the last of the}} ascetics died without an heir in 1776 AD, the king invited non-ascetic Nambudiris from Kerala for priesthood, a practice that continues in modern times. Till 1939, all the offerings made by the devotees to <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> went to the Rawal (chief priest), but after 1939, his jurisdiction was restricted to religious affairs. The administrative structure of <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> consists of a chief executive officer who executes the orders from the state government, a deputy chief executive officer, two OSDs, an executive officer, an account officer, a temple officer and a publicity officer to assist the chief executive officer.|$|E
5|$|As {{reported}} by Kamilla Trever in 1950, {{according to a}} different interpretation of the extant literary testimonia and the evidence provided by coinage, the erection of <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> started in 115 AD. The pretext for its construction {{would have been the}} declaration of Armenia as a Roman province and <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> would have housed the imperial effigy of Trajan.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} such temples which stand {{testimony}} to the exquite craftsmanship of the artisans of <b>the</b> region. <b>The</b> <b>temples</b> were crafted from the local laterite and brick. <b>The</b> <b>temples</b> are covered with terracota tiles depicting scenes from the epic Mahabharata. <b>The</b> <b>temples</b> are located in Bishnupur and across many other small villages in the Bankura district.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>temple's</b> name {{is synonymous}} with <b>the</b> <b>temple's</b> famous 'Zen garden', the karesansui (dry landscape) rock garden, {{thought to have been}} built in the late 15th century.|$|R
