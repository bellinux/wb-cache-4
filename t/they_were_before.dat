5|$|In September 2013, A {{bought the}} rights for an American {{remake of the}} French {{television}} series Les Revenants (The Returned), which is also about dead people coming back to life as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before.</b> Les Revenants, in turn, {{was inspired by a}} 2004 film of the same name directed by Robin Campillo and translated into English as They Came Back. When Seeley started working on Revival, a friend recommended he watch They Came Back to avoid similarities. Since The Returned is inspired by the film, he and Norton watched it and became fans of the show.|$|E
5|$|Judah {{returns to}} his home in Jerusalem. He meets Esther, and learns her {{arranged}} marriage did not occur and that she is still in love with him. He visits Messala and demands his mother and sister's freedom. The Romans discover that Miriam and Tirzah contracted leprosy in prison, and expel them from the city. The women beg Esther to conceal their condition from Judah so that he may remember them as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before,</b> so she tells him that they died. This false revelation changes Juda's mind, and he decides to seek vengeance on Messala by competing against him in the chariot race.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} Pleistocene ice {{ages and}} the start of the Holocene began to change the area's climate from a cool, wet pluvial one to dryer {{semi-arid}} conditions similar to that of today. With less water to cut, the erosive ability of the Colorado was greatly reduced. Mass wasting processes thus began to become relatively more important than <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before.</b> Steeper cliffs and further widening the Grand Canyon and its tributary canyon system occurred. An average of two debris flows per year reach the Colorado River from tributary canyons to form or expand rapids. This type of mass wasting is the main way the smaller and steeper side canyons transport sediment but it also {{plays a major role in}} excavating the larger canyons.|$|E

5|$|Although {{from the}} outset of the oil boom there were efforts at {{conservation}} and protection of the environment, they generally enjoyed little success. Because of the ease of finding oil in the early decades, wells were often not fully developed before prospectors began looking for more productive wells. The wildcatters not only wasted the valuable resource, but created avoidable environmental contamination with the numerous oil strikes. The rush to extract oil frequently led to the construction of poor storage facilities where leaks were common and water pollution became a serious issue. After heavy logging during the 19th century, the clearing of fields for oil exploration and the demand for lumber to be used in new construction destroyed most of the remaining forest lands in the state. Later environmental management efforts helped restore some of the forest lands but they remain a shadow of what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before</b> statehood.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Keli {{struck the}} islands of Tuvalu on June 12 and 13, with {{extensive}} damage reported throughout the Islands with trees uprooted by wind and waves. On Nivalakita, all buildings except for the church were flattened; an estimated cost to rebuild all of the houses as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before</b> the cyclone hit was estimated at A$ (US$), while {{it was estimated that}} the cost of rebuilding the houses with an improved, cyclone-resistant design would be about A$ (US$). The whole of Tepuka Savilivili was left uninhabitable, as coconut trees and other vegetation were swept away with no more than an area of jagged coral left behind. In Fiji, strong winds and rough seas were reported from the cyclone as it was moving to the north of Fiji, and while the cyclone was weakening it dropped 3.76inches (95.5mm) of rain on American Samoa.|$|E
5|$|The {{tour for}} Night in the Ruts {{commenced}} shortly thereafter but the band found themselves playing in {{smaller and smaller}} venues than <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before</b> due to their popularity beginning to wane. Steven Tyler's drug issues were starting to affect his performance and songwriting, and he reached bottom when he collapsed on stage during a show in Portland, Maine in 1980 and did not get up {{for the remainder of}} the set. Also in 1980, Aerosmith released its Greatest Hits album. While the compilation didn't chart very high initially, it gained popularity later and has gone on to become the band's bestselling album in the United States, with sales of 11 million copies. In the fall of 1980, Tyler was injured in a serious motorcycle accident, which left him hospitalized for two months, and unable to tour or record well into 1981.|$|E

25|$|As {{concerns}} the water flows, the link {{must comply with}} the so-called zero-solution. This has been achieved by deepening parts of the Great Belt, so that the water flow cross section has been increased. This excavation compensates for the blocking effect caused by the bridge pylons and approach ramps. The conclusion of the report is that water flows are now almost at the level <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before</b> the bridge was built.|$|E
25|$|Jewish {{survivors}} {{found it}} practically impossible to reconstruct their earlier lives as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before</b> in pre-war Poland. Jewish communities and Jewish {{life as it}} had existed was gone. Those Jews who somehow survived the Holocaust and returned to their town or villages often discovered that their homes had been looted or destroyed. Some homes had new repatriated inhabitants who at times were very unhappy to see returning Jewish survivors.|$|E

Roads passing through the village include the B367 (Upshott Lane/Church Hill) and B382 (Old Woking Road). Open areas in the south and east of the village are designated Metropolitan Green Belt.|$|E
25|$|Women's {{fashion in}} the mid-1980s became more {{colorful}} around 1984. This included long wool coats, long flared skirts, slim miniskirts, slightly tapered pants and stirrup ones, designer jeans, spandex cycling shorts, extremely long and bulky sweaters, jumpsuits, pastel colors, leather trenchcoats, fur coats, extremely large scarves, beanies, leather gloves, and dresses worn with wide or thin belts. The aerobics craze of the early 1980s continued into the mid 1980s, but the clothes became more colorful than <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{their time}} on the island, Babe and Josh become closer than <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before.</b> They sit by the fire, talk, share a kiss, and later snuggle {{together}} for warmth. Josh reveals to Babe that he loves her and {{wants to be with}} her. But Babe continues to insist that she wants to be with JR; if Josh cannot accept only her friendship, they will have to end their relationship. Josh reluctantly agrees. They are rescued by JR, Jamie, and Julia Santos.|$|E

25|$|Testosterone, {{along with}} its {{metabolite}} dihydrotestosterone, is extremely important to normal sexual functioning in men and women. Dihydrotestosterone is the most prevalent androgen in both men and women. Testosterone levels in women at age 60 are, on average, about half of what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before</b> the women were 40. Although this decline is gradual for most women, those who’ve undergone bilateral oophorectomy experience a sudden drop in testosterone levels; {{this is because the}} ovaries produce 40% of the body's circulating testosterone.|$|E
25|$|The {{placement}} of stress {{did not change}} from Classical to Vulgar Latin, and words continued to be stressed on the same syllable <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before.</b> However, the loss of distinctive length disrupted the correlation between syllable weight and stress placement that existed in Classical Latin. Where in Classical Latin {{the place of the}} accent was predictable from the structure of the word, it was no longer so in Vulgar Latin. Stress had become a phonological property and could serve to distinguish forms that were otherwise homophones.|$|E
25|$|Despite its laudable {{attributes}} {{to guard against}} luck it still {{can be regarded as}} rewarding a racer that happened to be hot that one day. After the '82 Grands, the pros vehemently protested this way of selecting its champion racer but apparently the ABA took a hard line. Another straw was that all of the pro classes would be subject to the transfer system just like the amateurs in the 1983 season instead of the cumulative system they were using for at least the qualifying rounds as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before</b> and during 1982.|$|E

25|$|However, the US real GDP growth rate, {{the real}} retail sales growth rate, and the {{inflation}} rate have all returned to roughly what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before</b> the Great Recession. Todd Clark has presented an empirical analysis which claims that volatility, in general, {{has returned to the}} same level as before the Great Recession. He concluded that while severe, the 2007 recession will in future be viewed as a temporary period {{with a high level of}} volatility in a longer period where low volatility is the norm, and not as a definitive end to the Great Moderation.|$|E
25|$|During occupation, ethnic {{tensions}} were raised and nationalism grew. The Malayans were thus {{on the whole}} {{glad to see the}} British back in 1945, but things could not remain as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before</b> the war, and a stronger desire for independence grew. Britain was bankrupt and the new Labour government was keen to withdraw its forces from the East as soon as possible. Colonial self-rule and eventual independence were now British policy. The tide of colonial nationalism sweeping through Asia soon reached Malaya. But most Malays were more concerned with defending themselves against the MCP which was mostly made up of Chinese, than with demanding independence from the British; indeed, their immediate concern was that the British not leave and abandon the Malays to the armed Communists of the MPAJA, which was the largest armed force in the country.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of the end for the charity haunts can be traced to a singular event: the Haunted Castle (Six Flags Great Adventure) caught fire on the evening of May 11, 1984, in Jackson Township, New Jersey. Eight teenagers lost their lives in the fire. There were criminal charges filed, civil lawsuits, numerous investigations, and the inevitable result that fire safety laws, building codes, and inspections were tightened up considerably nationwide. The net effect was to make charity attractions less economically viable than <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>before.</b> Better construction materials were required, and fire safety equipment was required, making a temporary venue too expensive for many charities to afford. As a result, the larger, better funded for-profit operators moved in as the charities moved out. The fire caused wide-ranging changes for all amusement buildings. Previously, operators were able to avoid fire codes because such attractions were used temporarily. The Haunted Castle fire pointed to an unattractive reality that forced tighter regulation.|$|E
