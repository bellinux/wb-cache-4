5|$|Thirteen {{years before}} the present, Robert Fassl (W. Earl Brown) sits in his van. He later {{approaches}} a home and claims {{to be there to}} repair the cable. As Fassl holds up a piece of paper to show it to the family who called for the repair, blood spatter splashes across the paper. He looks up and sees the house's occupants with slit throats in pools of blood. Abruptly, two police officers burst into the house and apprehend Fassl. One of the officers who goes <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> kitchen turns to reveal he is John Doggett (Robert Patrick) as a young NYPD officer.|$|E
5|$|Now {{known as}} Billy Talent, their sound {{began to move}} in a more aggressive, punk rock direction. During this time, Kowalewicz ran into Jen Hirst, at 102.1 the edge, the Toronto radio station he worked at. She had seen the band perform as Pezz, and he asked her <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> band's {{performance}} at a club. This would prove to pay off, as Hirst was later hired by Warner Music Canada to work in A. This connection would get the band their producer Gavin Brown, and a demo deal with the label. Before the demos were recorded, a local manager called Atlantic Records A executives, who were already in Toronto, to see the band perform in its tiny rehearsal space.|$|E

25|$|In 1972, after Ehart {{returned}} from England (where {{he had gone}} to look for other musicians), he and Hope once again re-formed White Clover with Robby Steinhardt (vocals, violin, viola, cello), Steve Walsh (vocals, keyboards, synthesizers, percussion) and Rich Williams (guitars). In early 1973 they recruited Livgren from the second Kansas group, which then folded. Eventually they received a recording contract with Don Kirshner's eponymous label, after Kirshner's assistant, Wally Gold, heard one of their demo tapes and came out <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> band at one of their local gigs in March 1973.

25|$|In May 1942, the 8th {{was without}} any aircraft, {{and the men}} of the {{squadron}} settled down to enjoy the rumor that eventually it would receive A-20 Havocs. Capt. Galusha, acting as Commander, obtained three A-20Cs from the 89th Squadron and proceeded <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> crews on the A-20. Hopes were high that the squadron would be re-equipped and everyone was expecting action in the not-too distant future. Their expectations would soon turn to disillusionment as the planes did not arrive—with a negative impact to morale. The crews flew with the 89th in their two borrowed A-20s flying missions, but the unit remained without aircraft until March 1943. Despite this the 8th's crews distinguished themselves flying with the 89th Squadron.|$|E
25|$|Baquedano wanted <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> troops situation, {{and moved}} {{dangerously close to}} the front line. Apparently, Peruvian {{soldiers}} fired upon Baquedano, and their shots were answered by the Chileans. In shot time, the cross fire became general, and the battle started unexpectedly at 14:00 hrs., catching both sides unprepared. However, the Chilean right was attacked by Cáceres' Corps. The Chilean battleships began to fire upon the Peruvians trying to ease the pressure. Cáceres saw the chance to destroy Lagos' division and sent the Guardia Chalaca and Guarnición de Marina battalions against Barceló, while a fraction of Col. Suárez' Corps engaged Urriola, who wasn't formed yet. The strength of the attack forced the Chileans to retreat. At this time, Lynch wasn't yet in position, so the cavalry and the artillery withdrew from the front line.|$|E

25|$|A {{nationwide}} county-by-county {{breakdown of}} Bahá'í populations ranks some counties in South Carolina {{as among the}} highest in the nation, (with a few in Georgia and South Dakota also notable): Marion at 10%, Williamsburg at 7.2%, and Dillon at about 6.3% in 2010, though the area of the county of Colleton where levels of activity had been high, were less than a third and closer to the statewide average. The fact that the Bahá'ís formed the second largest percentage of the religious in the whole of South Carolina made the news in 2014 even convincing a skeptic - Mark Silk, and avowed atheist Herb Silverman, finding leader of Secular Coalition for America, took the opportunity from the news <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> local Charleston Bahá'ís - and was favorably disposed.

25|$|All {{previous}} night fighter {{versions of the}} Ju 88 used a modified A-series fuselage. The G-series fuselage was purpose-built for {{the special needs of}} a night fighter, with the A-series' Bola ventral under-nose defensive gun position omitted for lower aerodynamic drag and less weight, and adding the enlarged squared-off vertical fin/rudder tail unit of the Ju 188. G-1 aircraft possessed more powerful armament and like the earlier R-1, used a pair of 1,700PS BMW 801 radial engines, the G-1 using the later BMW 801G-2 version. Electronic equipment consisted of the then-standard FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2 90MHz VHF radar using eight-dipole Hirschgeweih antennas, which could include fitment of the borderline-SHF-band FuG 350 Naxos radar detector with its receiving antenna housed in a teardrop-shaped streamlined fairing above the canopy, or FuG 227 Flensburg radar detector homing devices that had their own trio of twin-dipole antennae: one on each wing leading edge and one under the tail. One Ju 88G-1 of 7.

25|$|When a {{honey bee}} swarm {{emerges from a}} hive they do not fly far at first. They may gather in a tree or on a branch only a few meters from the hive. In this new location, the bees cluster about the queen and send 20 -50 scout bees out to find a {{suitable}} new nest locations.The scout bees are the most experienced foragers in the cluster. An individual scout returning to the cluster promotes a location she has found. She uses a dance similar to the waggle dance to indicate direction and distance {{to others in the}} cluster. The more excited she is about her findings the more excitedly she dances. If she can convince other scouts <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> location she found, they may take off, check out the proposed site and promote the site further upon their return. Several different sites may be promoted by different scouts at first. After several hours and sometimes days, slowly a favourite location emerges from this decision making process. When all scouts agree on a final location the whole cluster takes off and flies to it. Sometimes, if no decision is reached, the swarm will separate, some bees going in one direction; others, going in another. This usually results in failure, with both groups dying. A swarm may fly for a kilometre or more to the scouted out location, though some species may establish new colonies within as little as 500 meters from the natal nest, such as Apis dorsata. This collective decision making process is remarkably successful in identifying the most suitable new nest site and keeping the swarm intact. A good nest site has to be large enough to accommodate the swarm (about 15 litres in volume), has to be well protected from the elements, receive a certain amount of warmth from the sun, be some height above the ground, have a small entrance and resist the infestation of ants - hence why trees are often selected.|$|E

500|$|A second {{expedition}} {{to map the}} wreck of Scorpion was mounted in 1985. Only twelve days of search time would be left {{at the end of}} the {{expedition to}} look for Titanic. As Harris/Grimm's unsuccessful efforts had taken more than forty days, Ballard decided that extra help would be needed. He approached the French national oceanographic agency, IFREMER, with which Woods Hole had previously collaborated. The agency had recently developed a high-resolution side-scan sonar called SAR and agreed to send a research vessel, Le Suroît, to survey the sea bed in the area where Titanic was believed to lie. The idea was for the French to use the sonar to find likely targets, and then for the Americans to use Argo <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> targets and hopefully confirm whether they were in fact the wreck. The French team spent five weeks, from 5 July to 12 August 1985, [...] "mowing the lawn"– sailing back and forth across the [...] target area to scan the sea bed in a series of stripes. However, they found nothing, though it turned out that they had passed within a few hundred yards of Titanic in their first run.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of their career, the band's sound has also been {{described}} as alternative metal, sludge metal, doom metal, drone rock, hard rock, and alternative rock.

Then grunge came out and then we were hard rock. And now, since we've started doing this again I've seen us listed as: hard rock, alternative, alternative metal and just straight metal.

Drummer Sean Kinney rejects the grunge label, stating in a 2013 interview [...] "I mean, before we first came out there was no grunge, they hadn’t invented that word. Before they invented the word grunge we were alternative rock and alternative metal and metal and rock, and we didn’t give a shit whatever, we were a rock and roll band!".
