In 1861, Lincoln signed {{the second and third}} Morrill Tariff, the first having become law under James Buchanan. Also in 1861, Lincoln signed the Revenue Act of 1861, creating the first U.S. income tax. This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 ($ in current dollar terms), which was later changed by the Revenue Act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure.|$|E

5|$|If a {{cerebral}} aneurysm is identified on angiography, <b>two</b> <b>measures</b> {{are available to}} reduce the risk of further bleeding from the same aneurysm: clipping and coiling. Clipping requires a craniotomy (opening of the skull) to locate the aneurysm, followed by the placement of clips around the neck of the aneurysm. Coiling is performed through the large blood vessels (endovascularly): a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin and advanced through the aorta to the arteries (both carotid arteries and both vertebral arteries) that supply the brain. When the aneurysm has been located, platinum coils are deployed that cause a blood clot to form in the aneurysm, obliterating it. The decision as to which treatment is undertaken is typically made by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a neurosurgeon, neuroradiologist, and often other health professionals.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the minor themes in the B strain, the third section is upbeat but with bittersweet harmonies, returning once again to the scale of B-flat major. Here, for the first time, the piece departs from the standard left-hand pattern that characterizes most ragtime. This section of the piece {{has been compared to}} the style of twelve bar blues. The C strain also represents the only known time when Joplin departs from the standard sixteen-bar form, being instead 24 bars in length with an uneven 14- and 10-bar division.

5|$|This is a concise work, {{in terms}} of its duration, the economy of {{thematic}} material presented, and also the narrow registers within which the four parts operate. The first movement is in 6/8 time and a monothematic sonata form. The development and recapitulation sections feature an example of Haydn's musical jokes. In this case he tinkers with the movement's sonata form by reference to an historical variation of it. The recapitulation starts only with a statement of the second phrase of the movement's theme, which is in the dominant. This would have been a common technique earlier in the eighteenth century that, in this instance, is liable to confuse the unknowing listener looking for the statement of the first phrase of the theme in the tonic. It is not until 27 measures later that the listener is presented with a more emphatic reprise, which is actually a coda. The coda involves the statement of the main theme in the tonic that the listener might have been expecting, and it does so after <b>two</b> <b>measures</b> of pointed silence.|$|E
5|$|With no {{casualties}} {{observed on}} the Indian side, both missile attacks (Trident and Python) led the Pakistan Navy to take extreme measures {{to prevent any}} further damage. The rescue efforts were immediately coordinated by Rear Admiral Patrick Simpson who kept morale high among the Pakistani Navy officers. For this, {{he was awarded the}} Sitara-e-Jurat. Lieutenant Commander Vijai Jerath, the commanding officer of Vinash, was awarded the Vir Chakra for this operation. The Pakistani High Command ordered ships to reduce their ammunition dumps so as to reduce the explosion damage, if hit. The ships were also ordered not to manoeuvre out at sea, especially during the night, unless ordered to do so. These <b>two</b> <b>measures</b> severely demoralized Pakistani naval crews. With the destruction caused by the Indian Navy, neutral merchant vessels soon started to seek safe passage from the Indian authorities before heading to Karachi. Gradually, neutral ships ceased sailing for Karachi. In effect, a de facto naval blockade was created by the Indian Navy.|$|E

5|$|Following the Bisho massacre, {{in which}} 28 ANC {{supporters}} and one soldier were shot dead by the Ciskei Defence Force during a protest march, Mandela realised that mass action was leading to further violence and resumed negotiations in September.

The negotiations agreed that a multiracial general election would be held, resulting in a five-year coalition {{government of national unity}} and a constitutional assembly that gave the National Party continuing influence. The ANC also conceded to safeguarding the jobs of white civil servants; such concessions brought fierce internal criticism. The duo agreed on an interim constitution based on a liberal democratic model, guaranteeing separation of powers, creating a constitutional court, and including a US-style bill of rights; it also divided the country into nine provinces, each with its own premier and civil service, a concession between de Klerk's desire for federalism and Mandela's for unitary government.|$|E

When feed conversion efficiency is adjusted to weight of saleable meat divided by feed consumed, Limousin feed conversion efficiency then exceeds both British and continental European breeds by 10–25%. The USMARC study also indicated that Limousins were very significantly the slowest of all breeds to achieve market specifications of three measures of rib eye fat (300 to 400 days longer than the British breeds, and 170 to 220 days longer than the other continental European breeds) while feed conversion efficiency based on live weight gain was poorer (25–30% less than the British breeds and 12–16% less than the other continental European breeds). When corrected to saleable meat divided by feed consumed, feed conversion efficiency was similar or marginally better for Limousins. At these end points, Limousins finished at markedly heavier live weights (up to 490kg heavier than the British breeds, and 190kg heavier than the other continental European breeds).|$|E

25|$|Mario Bauzá {{developed}} the 3-2 / 2-3 clave concept and terminology. A chord progression can begin {{on either side}} of clave. When the progression begins on the three-side, the song or song section is said to be in 3-2 clave. When the chord progression begins on the two-side, it is in 2-3 clave. In North America, salsa and Latin jazz charts commonly represent clave in <b>two</b> <b>measures</b> of cut-time (2/2); this is most likely the influence of jazz conventions. When clave is written in <b>two</b> <b>measures</b> (above) changing from one clave sequence to the other is a matter of reversing the order of the measures. Bauzá consciously maintained a balance of Latino and jazz musicians in Machito's band, in order to realize his vision of Afro-Cuban jazz. Bauzá had the unique experience of mastering both types of music, but it took time for him to teach the jazz musicians in Machito's band about clave. The first time jazz trumpeter Doc Cheatham joined the band, Machito had to fire him after just two nights because he couldn't cope with clave.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: I use an {{experiment}} {{to examine how}} accurate versus inaccurate relative incentive weights on multiple measures that lead bottom-line financial results (i. e., lead measures) affects managerial performance. The experiment has three types of incentive contracts which reward different combinations of performance measures: only a lag financial <b>measure</b> (ONLYLAG), <b>two</b> lead <b>measures</b> and a lag financial measure (LEADLAG), or only <b>two</b> lead <b>measures</b> (ONLYLEAD). I find that adding lead measures to an incentive contract with only a lag measure (LEADLAG versus ONLYLAG) increases performance when the <b>two</b> lead <b>measures</b> have accurate relative weights, but does not decrease nor increase performance when the <b>two</b> lead <b>measures</b> have inaccurate relative weights. Hence, the addition of lead measures at best benefits performance when the relative weights on lead measures are accurate, and at worst does not harm performance when the relative weights on lead measures are inaccurate. I also find that removing the lag measure from the incentive contract (ONLYLEAD versus LEADLAG) increases performance when the <b>two</b> lead <b>measures</b> have accurate relative weights, but decreases performance when the <b>two</b> lead <b>measures</b> have inaccurate relative weights.
