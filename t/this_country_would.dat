25|$|The Times {{continued}} {{in its efforts}} to calm British public opinion when it printed:The signatories of the ridiculous ultimatum to Great Britain are men of no account. Nobody in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> have taken them seriously, but for the recent outrages in Great Britain. As a political force in Éire, the IRA simply does not count.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers responded {{positively}} to the cast. Kendall described the acting as [...] "top notch" [...] and Owen {{said that all}} cast-members [...] "played their roles to perfection", while Jane Simon, writing for The Daily Mirror, said that [...] "every twinge of awkwardness and discomfort is played to perfection as the mood turns darker". Harry Venning, writing for The Stage, described the cast as [...] "impressively stellar", and also commended the writers' performances. Comedy critic Bruce Dessau said that the [...] "cast alone is almost recommendation enough", while another reviewer said that if [...] "a bomb dropped on the cupboard where they were hiding, {{a good portion of}} the acting talent in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> be wiped out." [...] Key's portrayal of Ian and Parkinson's portrayal of Rebecca were particularly praised.|$|E
2500|$|A Los Angeles Times {{editorial}} dated April 22, 1943, stated that: [...] “As a race, the Japanese {{have made}} for themselves {{a record for}} conscienceless treachery unsurpassed in history. [...] Whatever small theoretical advantages there might be in releasing those under restraint in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> be enormously outweighed by the risks involved.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Clavering," [...] he said hoarsely, [...] "if you are deceiving me you are {{not going}} to find a hole in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> that <b>would</b> hide you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It cannot be, lady," [...] said Du Guesclin. [...] "This night hath over wrought you, {{and your}} senses play you false. What men ere there in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> who <b>would</b> sing {{in a strange}} tongue?" ...|$|R
2500|$|President Kennedy {{supported}} the statement made by Stevenson: [...] "I have emphasized before {{that this was}} a struggle of Cuban patriots against a Cuban dictator. While we could not be expected to hide our sympathies, we made it repeatedly clear that the armed forces of <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> not intervene in any way".|$|E
2500|$|The Loyal Opposition acquiesced too. Some disgruntled Tories {{claimed they}} would repeal the Bill once they regained a majority. But in 1834, Robert Peel, the new Conservative leader, {{put an end}} to this threat when he stated in his Tamworth Manifesto that the Bill was [...] "a final and {{irrevocable}} settlement of a great constitutional question which no friend to the peace and welfare of <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> attempt to disturb".|$|E
2500|$|Upon his capture, Wolfe Tone famously said, [...] "From my {{earliest}} youth I have regarded {{the connection between}} Ireland and Great Britain as {{the curse of the}} Irish nation, and felt convinced, that while it lasted, <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> never be free or happy. In consequence, I determined to apply all the powers which my individual efforts could move, in order to separate the two countries." [...] After being denied a soldier's death by firing squad, Wolfe Tone cheated the hangman by cutting his own throat.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think the}} best plan will be to lead our horses, Mike, across <b>this</b> <b>country.</b> It <b>would</b> seem natural to do so, and once through them, we could then gallop round and join the troops on the plateau." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] he said roughly, [...] "that you'll {{find him}} at home when you get there, madam, {{wherever}} that may be. If he were in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> it <b>would</b> be within the four walls of a prison." ...|$|R
5000|$|In his {{arguments}} against the mosque, Weinstein {{told the audience}} of about 30, [...] "if, God forbid, an Islamic state ever came to fruition in <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> we <b>would</b> be doomed. Is {{that what you want}} in this country?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Past {{comments}} {{came back}} to haunt Goldwater throughout the campaign. He had once called the Eisenhower administration [...] "a dime-store New Deal", and the former president never fully forgave him. Eisenhower did, however, film a television commercial with Goldwater. Eisenhower qualified his voting for Goldwater in November by remarking that he had voted not specifically for Goldwater, but for the Republican Party. In December 1961, Goldwater had told a news conference that [...] "sometimes I think <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> {{be better off if}} we could just saw off the Eastern Seaboard and let it float out to sea". That comment boomeranged on him during the campaign {{in the form of a}} Johnson television commercial, as did remarks about making Social Security voluntary, and statements in Tennessee about selling the Tennessee Valley Authority, a large local New Deal employer.|$|E
2500|$|Bernie Sanders opposes {{guest worker}} {{programs}} {{and is also}} skeptical about skilled immigrant (H-1B) visas, saying, [...] "Last year, the top 10 employers of H-1B guest workers were all offshore outsourcing companies. These firms are responsible for shipping large numbers of American information technology jobs to India and other countries." [...] In an interview with Vox he stated his opposition to an open borders immigration policy, describing it as:...a right-wing proposal, which says essentially there is no United States...you're doing away {{with the concept of}} a nation-state. [...] What right-wing people in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> love is an open-border policy. Bring in all kinds of people, work for $2 or $3 an hour, that would be great for them. I don’t believe in that. I think we have to raise wages in this country, I think we have {{to do everything we can}} to create millions of jobs.|$|E
2500|$|The Cairo {{declaration}} followed {{years of}} limited {{acceptance of the}} Universal declaration by predominantly Muslim states. As an example, in 1984, Iran's UN representative, Said Raja'i Khorasani, said the following amid allegations of human rights violations, [...] " [...] recognized no authority ... apart from Islamic law.... Conventions, declarations and resolutions or decisions of international organizations, which were contrary to Islam, had no validity in the Islamic Republic of Iran.... The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which represented secular understanding of the Judaeo-Christian tradition, could not be implemented by Muslims and did not accord with the system of values recognized by the Islamic Republic of Iran; <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> therefore not hesitate to violate its provisions." [...] These departures, both theoretical and practical, {{have resulted in a}} multitude of practices and cases criticized by international human rights groups. See human rights in Iran, human rights in Saudi Arabia, and Taliban treatment of women for specific examples.|$|E
6000|$|A faint colour {{crept into}} Clavering's face. [...] "I know {{a good many}} which would make the bargain unfair to her," [...] he said, [...] "but {{there are very few}} men in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> who <b>would</b> be good enough for her." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Such {{a boycott}} would cut a {{university}} off from its life blood, the nurturing flow of ideas.... The campaign plays {{directly into the}} hands of the destructive right-wing in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> which <b>would</b> also dearly love to cut us off from the world and its influences." ...|$|R
5000|$|Comparable burdens {{and ability}} to pay: with <b>this</b> approach, <b>countries</b> <b>would</b> reduce {{emissions}} based on comparable burdens {{and their ability to}} take on the costs of reduction. Ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population, as well as other, more complex measures, like the UNDP's Human Development Index.|$|R
2500|$|Because of a {{paralysis}} {{that started}} in early 1961 and progressed quickly in 1966, on the 2nd February Cemal Gürsel was flown to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. on the private airplane [...] "BlueBird" [...] sent by US President Lyndon B. Johnson. One week later, he fell into a coma there after suffering a series of new paralytic strokes. The government decided he return to Turkey on 24 March. President Johnson went by helicopter from the White House to Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, near Washington, D.C., to pay his respects to President Cemal Gürsel on his departure to home, In addition to issuing the following statement 'Our distinguished friend, President Cemal Gursel of Turkey, came to the United States on 2 February for medical treatment. There was hope that new therapeutic procedures only recently developed in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> be useful in treating his illness of several years. We were initially encouraged by his progress at Walter Reed Hospital, only to be shocked by the news on 8 February that his health had suffered a grave new blow. Our best talent, coupled with the skill of the eminent Turkish doctors who accompanied the President, was exerted to the utmost {{in the hope that}} the President might return to his home in fully restored health. We are saddened that this hope was not to be realized. We have been deeply honored to have President Gürsel come to our country to seek medical treatment. As he returns to his homeland, our prayers go with him'. With a report of a medical committee by Gülhane Military Hospital in Ankara, the parliament ruled on 28 March 1966 that his presidency be terminated due to ill health in accordance with the constitution. He died of apoplexy at 0645 hrs on 14 September 1966 in Ankara. He left behind no directives or last will. He was laid to rest at the [...] "Freedom Martyrs Memorial" [...] section in the yard of the mausoleum of Atatürk. His body was transferred on 27 August 1988 to a permanent burial place in the newly built Turkish State Cemetery.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't tempt me," [...] he begged. [...] "I {{can assure}} you that without me the {{constitution}} of <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> collapse within a week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But all {{the people}} in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> come here to defend the city!" [...] I exclaimed, {{thinking}} for the moment that Bill Jepson was trying to play upon our fears.|$|E
5000|$|M.L. Rosenthal, the {{prominent}} critic and champion of poetry, felt that Dana was a [...] "richly lyrical poet" [...] who was [...] "very hard on himself {{and on the}} Karma of our world, whose work <b>this</b> whole <b>country</b> <b>would</b> recognize itself in, if it ever started to open books of poems." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{as eager}} {{to save your}} own lives as we are ours," [...] Neal replied, [...] "and since you are {{familiar}} with <b>this</b> <b>country</b> it <b>would</b> be foolish for us to offer any advice. Do whatever {{in the opinion of}} both is best, and we will obey orders." ...|$|R
2500|$|According to American legal {{commentator}} Kendal Coffey, [...] "In <b>this</b> <b>country</b> we <b>would</b> say, {{with this}} kind of media exposure, you could not get a fair trial". In the United States, there was a pretrial publicity campaign supporting Knox and attacking Italian investigators, but her lawyer thought it was counter-productive.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} to say," [...] said Dick furiously, [...] "that the ragpickers and sneaks that wade around in the slumgallion of <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> dare to spatter that young gal?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{nothing at}} all," [...] Maraton replied. [...] "I {{am not sure}} that a {{successful}} invasion of <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> not {{be one of the best}} medicines she could possibly have." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} {{stranger}} gravely, [...] "that was blame unlike Jimmy. There's {{only one man}} in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> {{do that kind of}} thing, and as he hasn't a wagon to fit what you're telling me, it couldn't he him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{he replied}} reflectively, [...] "there {{is a good}} deal in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> that <b>would</b> {{interest}} a sensible man, but I'm not sure that's exactly what has kept Mr. Wisbech so long in Victoria. I've a point or two to mention later, but I'll let him speak first. It's his affair." ...|$|R
60|$|BURGE-LUBIN. You do {{not know}} the history of <b>this</b> <b>country.</b> What <b>would</b> my {{ancestors}} have said to the menagerie of degenerates that is still called the House of Commons? Confucius: you will not believe me; and I do not blame you for it; but England once saved the liberties of the world by inventing parliamentary government, which was her peculiar and supreme glory.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{it must be}} so," [...] he answered. [...] "Tell me, Miss Penelope," [...] he added, [...] "may I {{ask your}} aunt or the Duchess to bring you one day to my house to see my treasures? I cannot say how long I shall remain in <b>this</b> <b>country.</b> I <b>would</b> like you so much to come before I break up my little home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To the onlookers," [...] Mr. Sabin remarked, [...] "a {{revolution}} in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> possess many interesting features. The common people lack {{the ferocity of}} our own rabble, but they are even more determined. I may yet live to see an English Duke earning an honest living in the States." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{must admit}} that he has pluck," [...] he remarked critically. [...] "At the same time I cannot see that a single effort of this sort entitles {{a man to be}} {{considered}} a sportsman. He doesn't shoot, nor does he ever ride except when he is on military service. He neither plays games nor has he the instinct for them. A man without the instinct for games is a fellow I cannot understand. He'd never get along in <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> <b>would</b> he, Wilmot?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The visit we {{have been}} just honoured with, my young friend, has given you,' he said, 'more secrets to keep than I would have wished you {{burdened}} with. The lady is a person of condition--of rank and fortune--but nevertheless is so circumstanced that the mere fact of her being known to be in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> occasion many evils. I should wish you to observe secrecy on this subject, even to Redgauntlet or Maxwell, however much I trust them in all that concerns my own affairs.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There are, I think, {{very few}} men in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> who <b>would</b> {{have spoken to}} that man or Dom Clemente as you have done," [...] he said. Then he grinned in a very suggestive fashion. [...] "It is {{probably}} fortunate {{that he seemed to}} believe you, though if he had been any other man I would have called him very foolish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is enough; {{you would}} be thought a rich man in <b>this</b> <b>country.</b> Still, I <b>would</b> prefer to have your father's consent. It is our custom that a {{marriage}} should be arranged {{with the approval of}} both families." ...|$|R
50|$|To achieve <b>this,</b> {{producing}} <b>countries</b> <b>would</b> {{not produce}} oil {{in excess of}} their present national depletion rate: i.e., roughly speaking, the oil burnt, expended or exported must equal the oil produced or imported. Furthermore, it would be required that importing nations stabilize their imports at existing levels. This would {{have the effect of}} keeping world prices in reasonable relationship to actual production costs and let Third World countries afford their oil imports.|$|R
