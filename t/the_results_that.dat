These observations, combined with observations of Kepler-10's spectrum taken from the W.M. Keck Observatory, ruled {{out the possibility that}} a nearby star's light was corrupting the observed spectrum of Kepler-10 and creating <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>that</b> had led astronomers to believe that a second planet existed in Kepler-10's orbit. All of these possibilities, with the exception of if such a star existed exactly behind or in front of Kepler-10, were effectively ruled out; even with this, the Kepler team found that if a star was indeed aligned with Kepler-10 as seen from Earth, such a star would probably not be a giant star.|$|E

25|$|A {{company that}} hires {{researchers}} {{to perform a}} study may require the researchers to sign a nondisclosure agreement before they are funded, by which researchers waive their right to release any results independently and release them only to the sponsor.

25|$|Job {{performance}} represents behaviors employees {{engage in}} while at work which contribute to organizational goals. These behaviors are formally evaluated by an organization {{as part of}} an employee's responsibilities. In order to understand and ultimately predict job performance, {{it is important to be}} precise when defining the term. Job performance is about behaviors that are within the control of the employee and not about results (effectiveness), the costs involved in achieving results (productivity), <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>that</b> can be achieved in a period of time (efficiency), or the value an organization places on a given level of performance, effectiveness, productivity or efficiency (utility).|$|E

25|$|Following an {{introductory}} {{meeting with the}} Office of District Government Matiari, the British schoolteachers visit several {{public schools in the}} vicinity, including one for children with mental disabilities. They discover that teaching styles are more direct in Pakistan, with an ‘I talk, you listen’ approach as opposed to ‘let us do it together’ that is used in the UK. One look at the children’s report cards, however, ascertains the effectiveness of this approach in <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>that</b> appear to be just as good. An emphasis on discipline surfaces as a common feature in all the individual opinions expressed, when inquired about the school visits.|$|E
25|$|Consider an {{experiment}} {{that can produce}} a number of outcomes. The set of all outcomes is called the sample space of the experiment. The power set of the sample space (or equivalently, the event space) is formed by considering all different collections of possible results. For example, rolling an honest die produces one of six possible results. One collection of possible results corresponds to getting an odd number. Thus, the subset {1,3,5} {{is an element of}} the power set of the sample space of die rolls. These collections are called events. In this case, {1,3,5} is the event that the die falls on some odd number. If <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>that</b> actually occur fall in a given event, that event is said to have occurred.|$|E

25|$|Cardboard, {{aluminium}} foil, {{and plastic}} bags {{for well over}} 10,000 solar cookers have been donated to the Iridimi Refugee Camp and Touloum Refugee Camps in Chad by the combined efforts of the Jewish World Watch, the Dutch foundation KoZon, and SCI. The refugees construct the cookers themselves, using the donated supplies and locally purchased Arabic gum, and use them for midday and evening meals. The goal of this project was to reduce the Darfuri women's need to leave the relative safety of the camp to gather firewood, which exposed them to {{a high risk of}} being beaten, raped, kidnapped, or murdered. It has also significantly reduced the amount of time women spend tending open fires each day, with <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>that</b> they are healthier and they have more time to grow vegetables for their families and make handicrafts for export.|$|E
25|$|Another {{class of}} related results {{concerns}} perfect graphs: every bipartite graph, the complement of every bipartite graph, the line graph of every bipartite graph, and the complement {{of the line}} graph of every bipartite graph, are all perfect. Perfection of bipartite graphs {{is easy to see}} (their chromatic number is two and their maximum clique size is also two) but perfection of the complements of bipartite graphs is less trivial, and is another restatement of König's theorem. This was one of <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>that</b> motivated the initial definition of perfect graphs. Perfection of the complements of line graphs of perfect graphs is yet another restatement of König's theorem, and perfection of the line graphs themselves is a restatement of an earlier theorem of König, that every bipartite graph has an edge coloring using a number of colors equal to its maximum degree.|$|E
25|$|Some {{changes made}} to Internet search engines {{included}} that of Google's search engine. Beginning in 2009, Google {{began to run}} a new system where the Google search became personalized. The item that is searched and <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>that</b> are shown remembers previous information that pertains to the individual. Google search engine not only seeks what is searched, but also strives to allow the user to feel like the search engine recognizes their interests. This is achieved by using online advertising. A system that Google uses to filter advertisements and search results that might interest the user is by having a ranking system that tests relevancy that include observation of the behavior users exude while searching on Google. Another function of search engines is the predictability of location. Search engines are able to predict where one's location is currently by locating IP Addresses and geographical locations.|$|E

25|$|Although it {{is unclear}} when the AMY1 gene copy number began to increase, it is known and {{confirmed}} that the AMY1 gene existed in early primates. Chimpanzees, the closest evolutionary relatives to humans, {{were found to have}} 2 diploid copies of the AMY1 gene that is identical in length to the human AMY1 gene, which is significantly less than that of humans. On the other hand, bonobos, also a close relative of modern humans, was found to have more than 2 diploid copies of the AMY1 gene. Nonetheless, the bonobo AMY1 genes were sequenced and analyzed, and {{it was found that the}} coding sequences of the AMY1 genes were disrupting, which may lead to the production of dysfunctional salivary amylase. It can be inferred from <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>that</b> the increase in bonobo AMY1 copy number is likely not correlated to the amount of starch in their diet. It was further hypothesized that the increase in copy number began recently during early hominin evolution as none of the great apes had more than two copies of the AMY1 gene that produced functional protein. In addition, it was speculated that the increase in the AMY1 copy number began around 20,000 years ago when humans shifted from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to agricultural societies, which was also when humans relied heavily on root vegetables high in starch. This hypothesis, although logical, lacks experimental evidence due to the difficulties in gathering information on the shift of human diets, especially on root vegetables that are high in starch as they cannot be directly observed or tested. Recent breakthroughs in DNA sequencing has allowed researchers to sequence older DNA such as that of Neanderthals to a certain degree of accuracy. Perhaps sequencing Neanderthal DNA can provide a time marker as to when the AMY1 gene copy number increased and offer insight into human diet and gene evolution.|$|E
