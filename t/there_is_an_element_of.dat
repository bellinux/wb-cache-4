Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and realize that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> shared attention. For an instance of social engagement to count as triadic joint attention it requires at least two individuals attending to an object or focusing their attention on each other. Additionally, the individual must display awareness that focus is shared between himself or herself and another individual. Triadic {{attention is}} marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object.|$|E

Mutual gaze is marked by both the parent and infant looking at each other's face. If two individuals are simply looking at an object, it is referred to as shared gaze.|$|E
5|$|Hick used Irenaeus' {{notion of}} {{two-stage}} creation {{and supported the}} belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created in the image of God means to have the potential for knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of God is complete. Humanity currently exists in the image of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity. Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if they choose to out of their own free will. Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we would know that someone who is suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> mystery to suffering, to the effect that some people suffer without benefit, it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.|$|E

25|$|The {{biological}} {{techniques used}} to control the populace in Brave New World do not include genetic engineering; Huxley wrote the book before the structure of DNA was known. However, Gregor Mendel's work with inheritance patterns in peas had been rediscovered in 1900 and the eugenics movement, based on artificial selection, was well established. Huxley's family included a number of prominent biologists including Thomas Huxley, half-brother and Nobel Laureate Andrew Huxley, and his brother Julian Huxley who was a biologist and involved in the eugenics movement. Nonetheless, Huxley emphasises conditioning over breeding (nurture versus nature); human embryos and fetuses are conditioned through a carefully designed regimen of chemical (such as exposure to hormones and toxins), thermal (exposure to intense heat or cold, as one's future career would dictate), and other environmental stimuli, although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> selective breeding as well.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> {{truth to}} Dayan's claim, {{but it is}} {{important}} to note that Israel regarded the de-militarized zones in the north as part of their sovereign territory and reserved the right to cultivate them—a right that the Syrians consistently resisted with force. Syria also worked to benefit from the Jordan river before it flowed into Israel, aiming to get use of it as a water source; Syria also actively supported Palestinian resistance movements against Israel. Israel occasionally exploited incidents in the de-militarized zones to strike at the Syrian water diversion project and to punish the Syrians for their support of the Palestinian resistance. Dayan's remarks must also be taken in context of the fact that he was a member of the opposition at the time. His attitude toward the Syrians changed dramatically once he became defense minister. Indeed, on June 8, 1967, Dayan bypassed both the Prime Minister and the Chief of staff in ordering the Israeli army to attack and capture the Golan.|$|E

On tour in 2000 and 2001, the band learned how to perform the electronic music live, combining synthetic sounds with conventional rock instrumentation. Songwriter Thom Yorke said: [...] "Even with electronics, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> spontaneous performance in using them. It was the tension between what's human and what's coming from the machines. That was stuff we were getting into."

Because of the nature of free improvisation, the women were able to perform together without concerns about competency. Georgie Born said that FIG functioned very differently from a mixed group: [...] "when you are playing with men, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> competition; they tend to feel that there is a threat from women. In an all-women band we are released from that kind of pressure." [...] Born added that without men, women are more honest and open with each other, and are more receptive to what each member of the group is doing.|$|E
500|$|The Order of the Arrow {{utilizes}} three nationally standardized ceremonies for Ordeal, Brotherhood, and Vigil Honor memberships using themes, stories, {{and symbols}} centered on American Indian traditions as {{interpreted by the}} Order of the Arrow. It also utilizes symbolic progression, so that no symbols are introduced before the proper time. This is done to keep the sense of mystery surrounding the ceremonies and their various symbols. [...] <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> mystery in the ceremonies {{for the sake of}} its effect on the participants, and so the three membership ceremonies are not performed in public.

500|$|Durkheim {{agrees with}} Kant that within morality, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> obligation, [...] "a moral {{authority}} which, by manifesting itself in certain precepts {{particularly important to}} it, confers upon [...] an obligatory character." [...] Morality tells us how to act {{from a position of}} superiority. There exists a certain, pre-established moral norm to which we must conform. It is through this view that Durkheim makes a first critique of Kant in saying that moral duties originate in society, and are not to be found in some universal moral concept such as the categorical imperative. Durkheim also argues that morality is characterized not just by this obligation, but is also something that is desired by the individual. The individual believes that by adhering to morality, they are serving the common Good, and for this reason, the individual submits voluntarily to the moral commandment.|$|E

500|$|The Edge of Glory was {{met with}} general acclaim from critics. While {{previewing}} the song Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone wrote a positive review: [...] "This one sounds crazy in print , but somehow it all seems totally natural when you actually hear it." [...] Perpetua added that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> cheesiness in the song, but nevertheless, it is captivating and catchy when one listens to it. He complimented the inclusion of Clemons as an [...] "inspired touch that amplifies the song's Eighties stadium rock vibe," [...] and Clemons' actual performance was described as amazing and among {{the best of his}} career. In another review, Perpetua noted that [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] is [...] "an immediate pop anthem". Fellow Rolling Stone journalist Jody Rosen complimented the hook, the chorus and Clemens' saxophone playing on the song. Jocelyn Vena from MTV News asserted that the song showed a softer side to Gaga, as opposed to her previous singles from Born This Way. Willa Paskin from New York was impressed with the track, saying: [...] "If the first two tracks off the forthcoming Born This Way were all jangly dance-rock, this is as smooth as an '80s jam straight off the Flashdance soundtrack, and it has the saxophone breakdown to prove it." [...] Paskin also believed that the song had potential to be a summer hit, but could face competition from singer Katy Perry's single, [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)".|$|E
500|$|... "I Luv This Shit" [...] {{was written}} by August Alsina, The Exclusives (Sean McMillion and Ralph Jeanty), Samuel Irving III, Christine Massa, and Trinidad James and was {{produced}} by Knucklehead. It was recorded by McMillion and Cody Sciara at Goldie's Playhouse and Zac Recording Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, and mixed by Jaycen Joshua with assistance from Trehy Harris at Larrabee Sound Studios, North Hollywood. Vocals were produced by The Exclusives. Knucklehead told Vibe in 2014 that he created the song's beat and {{knew it would be}} successful, stating: [...] "I just knew what [...] voice was gonna do over my beat. And that beat didn't sound like thing else at the time that was out ... When I made the beat, I called him immediately after I finished it." [...] After playing the beat to Alsina and The Exclusives, they recorded the song in one hour. It is an R song instrumented by guitar, synthesizer, synth-horns and a heavy bassline. The production was compared by Spin Brandon Soderberg to the work of The-Dream. It revolves around about partying with alcohol and drugs with the central hook [...] "I love this shit", and references the vodka Ciroc, yet <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> sorrow to Alsina's vocals. James' verse contemplates human nature, according to Gregory Adams of Exclaim!. [...] "I Luv This Shit" [...] was originally recorded for Alsina's mixtape The Product 2 (2013), and was included on his debut EP [...] (2013). It was also a bonus track on his first studio album, Testimony (2014).|$|E
