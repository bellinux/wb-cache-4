2500|$|Today engine lathes and CNC lathes are the {{commonly}} used machines for single-point threading. On CNC machines, {{the process is}} quick and easy (relative to manual control) due to the machine's ability to constantly track {{the relationship of the}} tool position and spindle position (called [...] "spindle synchronization"). CNC software includes [...] "canned cycles", that is, preprogrammed subroutines, that obviate the manual programming of a single-point threading cycle. Parameters are entered (e.g., <b>thread</b> <b>size,</b> tool offset, length of thread), and the machine does the rest.|$|E
2500|$|Instead of the {{standard}} AMC bell housing bolt pattern, AMC/Jeep engineers adopted the General Motors small V6 and four-cylinder bolt pattern (commonly used with GM's transverse-mounted powerplants) for their new engine, because the new AMC 2.5 replaced the four-cylinder engines that had been purchased from GM; and because AMC continued to buy the 2.8 L V6 from GM until the 4.0L I6 was introduced in 1987. The four-cylinder and V6 shared the same drivetrain components, whereas stronger transmissions were needed for the new 4.0L. The 2.5L also shared an 18mm threaded oil filter used with the GM 2.8L (ACDelco PF47 or equivalent) to 1986; when the 4.0L was phased into production with the XJ the oil filter was changed over to a 20mm <b>thread</b> <b>size</b> shared with Renaults until 1991.|$|E

50|$|Maudslay's {{invention}} about 1800 of a metal lathe to cut metal {{enabled the}} manufacture of standard screw <b>thread</b> <b>sizes.</b> Standard screw <b>thread</b> <b>sizes</b> allowed interchangeable parts {{and the development of}} mass production.|$|R
5000|$|MJTs {{can also}} be {{engineered}} to specifications for almost any application. There are few size limitations, {{and they can be}} used with extremely large <b>thread</b> <b>sizes</b> (as high as 32" [...] thread diameter). [...] They {{can also be}} used effectively in high temperature applications, given proper materials are used. Overall, the unique properties of MJTs created by the use of jackbolts can simplify complicated applications, especially for large <b>thread</b> <b>sizes.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} {{characteristic}} diameters of threads: major diameter, minor diameter, and pitch diameter: Industry standards specify minimum (min) and maximum (max) limits {{for each of}} these, for all recognized <b>thread</b> <b>sizes.</b> The minimum limits for external (or bolt, in ISO terminology), and the maximum limits for internal (nut), <b>thread</b> <b>sizes</b> are there to ensure that threads do not strip at the tensile strength limits for the parent material. The minimum limits for internal, and maximum limits for external, threads are there {{to ensure that the}} threads fit together.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are four}} {{commonly}} used <b>thread</b> <b>size</b> groups for mains supply lamps: ...|$|E
50|$|Mini-UHF {{connectors}} are miniaturized {{versions of}} UHF connectors, designed primarily {{for use in}} bag-type mobile phones and similar applications where size is an important consideration. Introduced in the 1970s, Mini-UHF has a 3/8-24 <b>thread</b> <b>size</b> and operates up to 2.5 GHz.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{non-significant}} part numbering system, part {{numbers are}} assigned {{in some other}} fashion, such as sequentially or arbitrarily. For example, a screw may have the part number [...] "1002", which may not tell the user anything about its <b>thread</b> <b>size,</b> length of shank, or drive type.|$|E
50|$|Additional product {{standards}} identify preferred <b>thread</b> <b>sizes</b> for {{screws and}} nuts, {{as well as}} corresponding bolt head and nut sizes, to facilitate compatibility between spanners (wrenches) and other tools.|$|R
5000|$|Sometime between 1912 and 1916, the Society of Automobile Engineers (SAE) {{created an}} [...] "SAE series" [...] of screw <b>thread</b> <b>sizes</b> {{reflecting}} parentage from earlier USS and ASME standards.|$|R
50|$|For softer more pliable plastics, {{hexagonal}} or square inserts {{with deep}} and wide grooves allow the plastic to flow and adhere. The process allows large product manufacture i.e. fuel tanks, boats etc., so the torque inserts {{may be of}} large <b>thread</b> <b>sizes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Metric hexagon bolts, {{screws and}} nuts are specified, for example, in British Standard BS 4190 (general purpose screws) and BS 3692 (precision screws). The {{following}} table lists the relationship given in these standards between the <b>thread</b> <b>size</b> and the maximal width across the hexagonal flats (wrench size): ...|$|E
50|$|The screws {{used in the}} Flexowriter were unique, having large flat {{heads with}} a very narrow {{screwdriver}} slot and a unique <b>thread</b> <b>size</b> and pitch. This {{may have been a}} conscious decision. Another reader found that standard 4-40UNC threads appear to fit some of the cover-attachments; internally, the headless set-screws require fluted Bristol keys, which are not commonly available in Great Britain.|$|E
5000|$|AN sizes {{range from}} -2 (dash two) to -32 in {{irregular}} steps, {{with each step}} equating to the OD (outside diameter) of the tubing in 1/16" [...] increments. Therefore, a -8 AN size would be equal to 1/2" [...] OD tube (8 Ã— 1/16 = 1/2). However, this system does not specify the ID (inside diameter) of the tubing because the tube wall can vary in thickness. Each AN size also uses its own standard <b>thread</b> <b>size.</b>|$|E
50|$|The E26 and E27 {{are usually}} interchangeable, {{as are the}} E39 and E40, because {{there is only a}} 1 mm {{difference}} in thread outside diameter. E11 and E12 are not interchangeable. Other semi-standard screw <b>thread</b> <b>sizes</b> are available for certain specific applications.|$|R
50|$|In 1987 Browning {{produced}} a modern {{version of the}} Model 71 in Japan. These have different <b>thread</b> <b>sizes</b> in places, most notably the barrels, and many parts will not interchange with the originals. The Browning version was a limited production model only.|$|R
50|$|Maudslay {{developed}} the first industrially practical screw-cutting lathe in 1800, allowing standardisation of screw <b>thread</b> <b>sizes</b> {{for the first}} time. This allowed the concept of interchangeable parts (an idea that was already taking hold) to be practically applied to nuts and bolts.|$|R
50|$|A {{characteristic}} {{model was}} the Diax Ia for interchangeable lenses, with 3 different viewfinders in the top, each {{in a different}} color: blue for 35mm lenses, yellow for 85 or 90mm lenses and neutral for 45 or 50 mm lenses. The Diax II, Diax IIa and Diaxette models were rangefinder cameras. The b models were like the a models, but with a rapid film advance lever. The Diax system also included 10 lens types covering 6 focal lengths with a common filter <b>thread</b> <b>size</b> of 40.5mm.|$|E

50|$|A lamp harp is the {{component}} of a lamp to which the lamp shade is attached. It typically comes in two separate parts, a saddle which is fastened under the lamp socket, and the harp itself which consist of a lightweight frame attached to the saddle at its lower end and extending upwards to a point above the bulb. At {{the top of the}} harp is a threaded rod. The shade's internal frame (known as a spider) mounts on this rod and is secured in place by a lamp finial. Common materials for harps include brass and nickel. The most common <b>thread</b> <b>size</b> is 1/4-27.|$|E
50|$|Henry Maudslay {{developed}} the first industrially practical screw-cutting lathe in 1800. This {{allowed for the}} standardisation of screw <b>thread</b> <b>sizes</b> {{for the first time}} and paved the way for the practical application of interchangeability (an idea that was already taking hold) to nuts and bolts.|$|R
5000|$|The screw <b>thread</b> <b>sizes</b> and [...] "genders" [...] {{used for}} {{attaching}} brushes to the rods vary between different calibers and manufacturers. Some {{of the most}} common threads and genders for rods/cords are listed below. Corresponding brushes and other accessories will have the opposite gender.|$|R
50|$|Some lampshades {{or light}} fittings, {{especially}} in glass, typically terminate in a finial which also serves to affix the shade to the lamp or fixture. Finials are twisted onto the lamp harp. Typically the finial is externally decorative whilst hiding an internal screw thread. There are several standard <b>thread</b> <b>sizes</b> which are used.|$|R
5000|$|When {{a feature}} called [...] "Enhancement Diversification" [...] was {{introduced}} in Issue 6 to impose sharply diminished returns {{on the effectiveness of}} Enhancements in order to encourage players to use more than one type of enhancement to fully balance the power, the community reacted negatively, claiming that it was effectively a global nerf. They also complained that after defensive powers had been changed in recent major patches, the Enhancement Diversification feature would force them to completely change their play tactics. The response by players to the announcement on the official forums eventually exceeded the <b>thread</b> <b>size</b> allowed by software, forcing a second thread to be started.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} use a Lensbaby with your digital video camera, you will need {{to use a}}n adapter. The {{following}} companies make adapters which have been tested and used successfully with a Lensbaby: P+S Technik, Redrock M2, Brevis35, Letus35 and SGpro. To use an adapter with the PL mount Lensbaby, {{you will need to}} choose an adapter that will attach to your camera (has the correct <b>thread</b> <b>size,</b> for example 72mm or 82mm) and features a PL Mount on the other end. You can also use an adapter with a digital video camera and an SLR mount Lensbaby; in this case you will need to choose an adapter that will attach to your camera and features an SLR (for example, Nikon) Mount on the other end.|$|E
5000|$|Usually, {{one side}} has a fixed type stepped threading, {{and the other}} side is {{threaded}} for a standard freewheel. Occasionally you may find double sided fixed hubs with stepped threading on both sides, but these are rare and only a few companies offer them. The fixed side has a stepped down diameter thread to accept a lockring. The larger diameter thread on the fixed side accepts a standard threaded cog, and uses the same size threads as the freewheel side of the hub. The most common standard I.S.O. <b>thread</b> <b>size</b> is 1.375" [...] x 24 tpi (threads per inch), but there are other less common older sizes (British 1.370" [...] x 24 tpi, French 34.7 x 1 mm, Italian 35 mm x 24 tpi).|$|E
50|$|The {{implementation}} of standards in industry and commerce became highly important {{with the onset}} of the Industrial Revolution and the need for high-precision machine tools and interchangeable parts. Henry Maudslay developed the first industrially practical screw-cutting lathe in 1800, which allowed for the standardisation of screw <b>thread</b> <b>sizes</b> for the first time.|$|R
50|$|Multi-jackbolt {{tensioners}} {{can be used}} on many {{press column}} applications, especially where large <b>thread</b> <b>sizes</b> are required. Thrust collars ease assembly and disassembly on large press columns, while greatly reducing critical problems such as thread galling and seizing. Multi-jackbolt tensioners are also used on tie-rods, bearing blocks, high-pressure piping, die cushions, cylinder ram bolting, and anchor bolts.|$|R
50|$|Threaded Stud - A {{threaded}} stud is a fastener {{consisting of a}} shank portion which is driven into the base material (and is therefore not visible after fastening) and a threaded portion (which remains visible after the fastening). An object is then attached to the threaded portion with a nut. The most common <b>thread</b> <b>sizes</b> are 1/4-20, and 3/8-16.|$|R

5000|$|Some thread manufacturers, {{especially}} those producing very fine silk threads, apply their own scales of thread measurement using [...] "aughts" [...] or zeroes (not unlike the zeros used in measuring {{the sizes of}} seed beads). Within a given manufacturer's spectrum, a higher [...] "aught count" [...] indicates a finer thread: this is usually given as a single digit followed by a forward slash and a zeroâ€” for example, 3/0 indicates a three-aught thread or a <b>thread</b> <b>size</b> [...] "000", but this number only has significance {{when compared to other}} threads produced by the same manufacturer: one manufacturer's 4/0 will always be more fine than that same manufacturer's 2/0, but will mean nothing if compared to the 4/0 of another manufacturer. The aught scale therefore is not suitable for conversion or comparison to other more-generalized weight scales, though it is in common use.|$|E
50|$|JIC fittings, {{defined by}} the SAE J514 and MIL-F-18866 standards, are a type of flare fitting {{machined}} with a 37-degree flare seating surface. JIC (Joint Industry Council) fittings are widely used in fuel delivery and fluid power applications, especially where high pressure (up to 10,000 psi) is involved. The SAE J514 standard replaces the MS16142 military specification, although some tooling is still listed under MS16142. JIC fittings are dimensionally identical to AN (Army-Navy) fittings, but are produced to less exacting tolerances and are generally less costly. SAE 45-degree flare fittings are similar in appearance, but are not interchangeable, though dash sizes 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 14, and 16 share the same <b>thread</b> <b>size.</b> Some couplings may have dual machined seats for both 37-degree and 45-degree flare seats.Komatsu and JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) fittings have flare ends similar to JIC fittings. Komatsu and JIS both use a 30-degree flare seating surface. The only difference is Komatsu uses milimeter thread sizes while JIS use a BSP (British Standard Pipe) thread. JIC fitting systems have three components that make a tubing assembly: fitting, flare nut, and sleeve. As with other flared connection systems, the seal is achieved through metal-to-metal contact between the finished surface of the fitting nose and the inside diameter of the flared tubing. The sleeve is used to evenly distribute the compressive forces of the flare nut to the flared end of the tube. Materials commonly used to fabricate JIC fittings include forged carbon steel, forged stainless steel, forged brass, machined brass, Monel and nickel-copper alloys.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} Presta valve has {{an external}} thread. An adapter can be fitted onto this external thread {{to permit the}} Presta valve {{to be connected to}} a pump with a Schrader chuck. The same adapter, because of a coincidence of <b>thread</b> <b>sizes,</b> may be able to convert a Schrader pump into one that can connect to flexible adapters of either kind.|$|R
5000|$|The {{more modern}} {{toolholder}} designs {{became known as}} the Caterpillar [...] "V-Flange", CAT, V-Flange, ANSI B5.50, SK, ISO, International (INT), BT, ISO 7388-1, DIN 69871, NFE 62540. Once again, there are slight variations in the tooling. Although the basic taper dimensions are the same, there are differences are in the flanges, draw-in <b>thread</b> <b>sizes,</b> and pull studs; the international versions use metric sizes.|$|R
50|$|Computer case screws are the {{hardware}} used to secure {{parts of a}} PC to the case. Although there are numerous manufacturers of computer cases, they have generally used three <b>thread</b> <b>sizes.</b> The Unified <b>Thread</b> Standard (UTS) originates from the United States while the ISO metric screw thread is standardized worldwide. In turn, these thread standards define preferred size combinations {{that are based on}} generic unitsâ€”some on the inch and others on the millimeter.|$|R
