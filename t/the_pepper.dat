5|$|Dato Mogol died in 1620 and was {{succeeded by}} his eldest son, Sulaiman. A period of turmoil erupted {{ten years later}} when the Queen of Pattani branded the new ruler of Siam, King Prasat Thong, a usurper and tyrant. The queen {{withheld}} tribute and ordered attacks on Ligor (present-day Nakhon Si Thammarat) and Bordelongh (present-day Phatthalung); Ayuthaya responded by blockading Pattani with an army of 60,000 men, as well as enlisting {{the help of the}} Dutch people in capturing the City. Singora became involved in the dispute and in 1633 sent an envoy to Ayuthaya requesting help. The outcome of this request is not known, but Dutch records show that Singora was severely damaged and <b>the</b> <b>pepper</b> crop destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In 1831, the brig Governor Endicott, of Salem, H. H.

He and some of his officers had gone ashore to negotiate for pepper in the town of Quallah Battoo when pirates took over the ship, murdered some of her crew and looted the cargo. Captain Endicott obtained aid from Governor Endicott and the ship James Monroe, of New York, J. Porter, master, to rescue his ship from her captors and return her to Salem, where he arrived 16 July 1831.|$|E
5|$|Mangalore's {{historical}} {{importance is}} {{highlighted by the}} many references to the city by foreign travellers. During the first century CE, Pliny the Elder, a Roman historian, made references to a place called Nitrias, as a very undesirable place for disembarkation, {{on account of the}} pirates which frequent its vicinity, while Greek historian Ptolemy in the second century CE referred to a place called Nitra. Ptolemy's and Pliny the Elder's references were probably made to the Netravati River, which flows through Mangalore. Cosmas Indicopleustes, a Greek monk, in his 6th century work Christian Topography mentions Malabar as the chief seat of <b>the</b> <b>pepper</b> trade, and Mangarouth (port of Mangalore) as one of the five pepper marts which exported pepper.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{current study}} {{demonstrates}} that the ultraviolet-B (UV-B) irradiation not only helps in improvement of the red color of <b>the</b> <b>peppers</b> but also reduces their rate of decay. <b>The</b> Capia <b>peppers</b> were harvested at their full red ripe stage and subjected to the UV-B treatment at doses 4. 46 kJ m– 2 (UV-B 15) and 8. 93 kJ m– 2 (UV-B 30). Post irradiation, <b>the</b> <b>peppers</b> were packaged and stored at 5 ± 1 °C temperature with 90 - 95 % RH for 49 days. The UV-B treated group showed lower L* values, but higher a* and h° values {{as compared to the}} control group. Therefore, it was found that both the doses of UV-B radiations could enhance the quality of red color of <b>the</b> <b>peppers.</b> However, <b>the</b> lower dose (4. 46 kJ m- 2) was found to be optimal for reducing the decay rate of <b>the</b> <b>peppers.</b> <b>The</b> UV-B 30 <b>peppers</b> showed highest respiration rate, electrolyte leakage, total soluble solids, and the amount of weight loss...|$|R

5|$|Chinese Muslim traders {{from the}} eastern coast of China arrived at the coastal towns of Indonesia and Malaysia in the early 15th century. They were led by the mariner Zheng He, who {{commanded}} several expeditions to southeastern Asia between 1405 and 1430. In the book Yingya Shenglan, his translator Ma Huan documented {{the activities of the}} Chinese Muslims in the archipelago and the legacy left by Zheng He and his men. These traders settled along the northern coast of Java, but there is no documentation of their settlements beyond the 16th century. The Chinese Muslims were likely to have been absorbed into the majority Muslim population. Between 1450 and 1520, the Ming Dynasty's interest in southeastern Asia reached a low point and trade, both legal and illegal, rarely reached the archipelago. The Portuguese made no mention of any resident Chinese minority population when they arrived in Indonesia in the early 16th century. Trade from the north was re-established when China legalized private trade in 1567 through licensing 50 junks a year. Several years later silver began flowing into the region, from Japan, Mexico, and Europe, and trade flourished once again. Distinct Chinese colonies emerged in hundreds of ports throughout southeastern Asia, including <b>the</b> <b>pepper</b> port of Banten.|$|E
25|$|White pepper {{consists}} solely of {{the seed}} of <b>the</b> <b>pepper</b> plant, with the darker-coloured skin of <b>the</b> <b>pepper</b> fruit removed. This is usually accomplished by {{a process known as}} retting, where fully ripe red pepper berries are soaked in water for about a week, during which the flesh of <b>the</b> <b>pepper</b> softens and decomposes. Rubbing then removes what remains of the fruit, and the naked seed is dried. Sometimes alternative processes are used for removing the outer pepper from the seed, including removing the outer layer through mechanical, chemical, or biological methods.|$|E
25|$|Black pepper is {{produced}} from the still-green, unripe drupes of <b>the</b> <b>pepper</b> plant. The drupes are cooked briefly in hot water, both to clean {{them and to}} prepare them for drying. The heat ruptures cell walls in <b>the</b> <b>pepper,</b> speeding the work of browning enzymes during drying. The drupes dry in the sun or by machine for several days, during which <b>the</b> <b>pepper</b> around the seed shrinks and darkens into a thin, wrinkled black layer. Once dry, the spice is called black peppercorn. On some estates, the berries are separated from the stem by hand and then sun-dried without the boiling process.|$|E

25|$|The Anglo-Dutch {{conflicts}} were {{useful for}} the VOC for driving out its competitors, the EIC, from the Indonesian archipelago, by force of arms. In 1665 first the only English factory in the Spice Islands, Pulo Run was definitively conquered, excluding the English from the clove trade. More importantly, the VOC subsequently conquered the sultanates in Makassar, Jambi, and Palembang, forcing the sultans to exclude the English and Danes (who had previously maintained factories there) from <b>the</b> <b>pepper</b> trade.|$|E
25|$|Before the 16th century, pepper {{was being}} grown in Java, Sunda, Sumatra, Madagascar, Malaysia, and {{everywhere}} in Southeast Asia. These areas traded mainly with China, or used <b>the</b> <b>pepper</b> locally. Ports in the Malabar area {{also served as}} a stop-off point for much of the trade in other spices from farther east in the Indian Ocean. Following the British hegemony in India, virtually all of the black pepper found in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa was traded from Malabar region.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} nineteenth century, however, Aceh had become an {{increasingly}} influential power due to its strategic location for controlling regional trade. In the 1820s it was the producer of over half the world's supply of black pepper. <b>The</b> <b>pepper</b> trade produced new wealth for the Sultanate and for the rulers of many smaller nearby ports that had been under Aceh's control, but were now able to assert more independence. These changes initially threatened Aceh's integrity, but a new sultan Tuanku Ibrahim, who controlled the kingdom from 1838 to 1870, reasserted power over nearby ports.|$|E

50|$|Stuffed Peppers (Bharvan Mirch or Bharva Hari Mirch) is one {{of several}} stuffed {{vegetable}} (Bharvan subji) dishes. It consists of bell peppers stuffed with cooked meat, potatoes, and onions and seasoned with chili, turmeric, coriander, cilantro, salt, and lemon juice. <b>The</b> <b>peppers</b> are then either browned in a Tava (frying pan) or baked in an oven until <b>the</b> <b>peppers</b> are scorched.|$|R
25|$|Antwerp {{experienced}} three booms {{during its}} golden age: the first based on <b>the</b> <b>pepper</b> market, a second launched by American silver coming from Seville (ending with {{the bankruptcy of}} Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the stabilising Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis in 1559, based on the textiles industry. At {{the beginning of the}} 16th century Antwerp accounted for 40% of world trade. The boom-and-bust cycles and inflationary cost-of-living squeezed less-skilled workers. In the century after 1541, however, the city's economy and population declined dramatically, while rival Amsterdam experienced massive growth.|$|E
25|$|At Cannanore they careened and {{refitted}} the ships, {{and were}} joined by the 12-ship squadron of Duarte de Lemos coming from Socotra along with the annual fleet of carracks coming from Portugal commanded by Gonçalo de Sequeira, with orders to relieve Lemos of his command and turn his ships over to the governor. The Portuguese now counted 1,680 men and 34 ships, among naus, caravels and galleys - though Gonçalo de Sequeira stayed behind with his ships to oversee the loading of <b>the</b> <b>pepper</b> and return to Portugal with Duarte de Lemos.|$|E
25|$|Unsurprisingly, the Portuguese proved {{unable to}} monopolize the spice trade. Older Arab and Venetian trade {{networks}} successfully imported enormous quantities of spices, and pepper once again flowed through Alexandria and Italy, {{as well as}} around Africa. In the 17th century, the Portuguese lost almost all of their valuable Indian Ocean trade to the Dutch and the English who, taking advantage from the Spanish ruling over Portugal during Iberian Union (1580–1640), occupied by force almost all Portuguese dominations in the area. <b>The</b> <b>pepper</b> ports of Malabar began to trade increasingly with the Dutch in the period 1661–1663.|$|E
