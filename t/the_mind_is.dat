5|$|Where is {{the mind}} located? If <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> a {{physical}} phenomenon of some kind, {{it has to}} be located somewhere. According to some, there are two possible options: either <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> internal to the body (internalism) or <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> external to it (externalism). More generally, either the mind depends only on events and properties taking place inside the subject's body or it depends also on factors external to it.|$|E
5|$|Dualism and monism {{are the two}} central {{schools of}} thought on the mind–body problem, {{although}} nuanced views have arisen that do not fit {{one or the other}} category neatly. Dualism is seen even in the Eastern tradition, in the Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, and Plato, but its entry into Western philosophy was thanks to René Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists like Descartes argue that <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> an independently existing substance, whereas property dualists maintain that <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but {{that it is not a}} distinct substance.|$|E
5|$|Semantic externalism {{holds that}} the {{semantic}} content of <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> totally or partially defined by state of affairs external {{to the body of}} the subject. Hilary Putnam's Twin earth thought experiment is a good example.|$|E

5|$|Descartes {{rejects the}} teleological, or purposive, {{view of the}} {{material}} world that was dominant in the West {{from the time of}} Aristotle. <b>The</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> not viewed by Descartes as part of the material world, and hence is not subject to the strictly mechanical laws of nature. Motion and rest, on the other hand, are properties of the interactions of matter according to eternally fixed mechanical laws. God only sets the whole thing in motion at the start, and later does not interfere except to maintain the dynamical regularities of the mechanical behavior of bodies. Hence there is no real teleology in the movements of bodies since the whole thing reduces to the law-governed collisions and their constant reconfigurations. The conatus is just the tendency of bodies to move when they collide with each other. God may set this activity in motion, but thereafter no new motion or rest can be created or destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Doubt {{about the}} {{possibility}} of a mechanistic explanation of thought drove René Descartes, and most other philosophers along with him, to dualism: the belief that <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> to some degree independent of the brain. There has always, however, been a strong argument in the opposite direction. There is clear empirical evidence that physical manipulations of, or injuries to, the brain (for example by drugs or by lesions, respectively) can affect the mind in potent and intimate ways. In the 19th century, the case of Phineas Gage, a railway worker who was injured by a stout iron rod passing through his brain, convinced both researchers and the public that cognitive functions were localised in the brain. Following this line of thinking, a large body of empirical evidence for a close relationship between brain activity and mental activity has led most neuroscientists and contemporary philosophers to be materialists, believing that mental phenomena are ultimately the result of, or reducible to, physical phenomena.|$|E
5|$|Pliny's {{purpose in}} writing the Natural History was to cover all {{learning}} and art so far as they are connected with nature or draw their materials from nature. He says:My subject is a barren one – the world of nature, or in other words life; and that subject in its least elevated department, and employing either rustic terms or foreign, nay barbarian words that actually have to be introduced with an apology. Moreover, the path is not a beaten highway of authorship, nor one in which <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> eager to range: {{there is not one}} of us who has made the same venture, nor yet one among the Greeks who has tackled single-handed all departments of the subject.|$|E

5|$|The most {{frequently}} used argument in favour of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is,</b> the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self, their personality, their soul, or some other such entity. They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding {{the idea that there}} is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible. Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading and that we should use our critical faculties, along with empirical evidence from the sciences, to examine these assumptions to determine whether there is any real basis to them.|$|E
5|$|Monism is the {{position}} that mind and body are not ontologically distinct entities (independent substances). This view was first advocated in Western philosophy by Parmenides in the 5th century BC and was later espoused by the 17th century rationalist Baruch Spinoza. Physicalists argue that only entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that mental processes will eventually be {{explained in terms of}} these entities as physical theory continues to evolve. Physicalists maintain various positions on the prospects of reducing mental properties to physical properties (many of whom adopt compatible forms of property dualism), and the ontological status of such mental properties remains unclear. Idealists maintain that <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself, or an illusion created by the mind. Neutral monists such as Ernst Mach and William James argue that events in the world {{can be thought of as}} either mental (psychological) or physical depending on the network of relationships into which they enter, and dual-aspect monists such as Spinoza adhere to {{the position}} that there is some other, neutral substance, and that both matter and mind are properties of this unknown substance. The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include behaviorism, the type identity theory, anomalous monism and functionalism.|$|E
25|$|The {{debate about}} the nature of <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> {{relevant}} to the development of artificial intelligence. If <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> indeed a thing separate from or higher than the functioning of the brain, then hypothetically it would be much more difficult to recreate within a machine, if it were possible at all. If, on the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> no more than the aggregated functions of the brain, then {{it will be possible to}} create a machine with a recognisable mind (though possibly only with computers much different from today's), by simple virtue of the fact that such a machine already exists in the form of the human brain.|$|E
40|$|The current {{method of}} {{minimally}} invasive harvesting the sural nerve in infants takes too much time. To reduce harvesting {{time a new}} Minimally Invasive Nerve Dissector (<b>MIND)</b> <b>was</b> designed. <b>The</b> <b>MIND</b> reduces instrument change by combining the two most used functions of the currently used instruments: firstly, {{the movement of the}} graft with the hook and secondly, the outwards motion of the micro scissors. Besides these two functions, <b>the</b> <b>MIND</b> <b>was</b> designed for a minimally invasive procedure and is much smaller than the current instruments. <b>The</b> <b>MIND</b> <b>was</b> evaluated on an artificial test facility simulating a leg of an infant. Using the test facility a test comparing the current instruments and <b>the</b> <b>MIND</b> <b>was</b> carried out. Measured were the time to harvest and the number of dissection instrument changes. The results of the test showed that both showed positive improvements with <b>the</b> <b>MIND.</b> BMEBioMechanical EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R

25|$|Many modern {{philosophers}} of mind adopt {{either a}} reductive or non-reductive physicalist position, maintaining in their different ways that <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> not something {{separate from the}} body. These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, e.g. {{in the fields of}} sociobiology, computer science, evolutionary psychology and the various neurosciences.

25|$|Dualism and monism are the {{two major}} schools of thought that attempt to resolve the mind–body problem. Dualism is the {{position}} that mind and body are in some way separate from each other. It {{can be traced back}} to Plato, Aristotle and the Nyaya, Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, but it was most precisely formulated by René Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists argue that <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> an independently existing substance, whereas Property dualists maintain that <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but that it is not a distinct substance.|$|E

50|$|Augustine’s theories, {{which were}} central doctrines {{throughout}} Christian civilization for a millennium, were, nonetheless, {{far removed from}} the more radical inwardness of enlightenment philosophers such as Descartes and Locke. In Descartes philosophy, the vision of a God given meaningful order involving a spiritual essence or expressive dimension within the world was altogether absent. God, moral value and virtue could not be found within the meaningful order of the world. For Descartes, the world and the human body <b>were</b> mechanisms. <b>The</b> <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> immaterial and rational. Understanding the world, our place {{in the world and the}} power of God depended on a rational objectification of the material world and a reflexive mental turn in which an individual came to see <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> as a mental, immaterial object that was autonomous from the material mechanistic world. For Descartes, <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> free from material control and <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> capable of rational, instrumental control of <b>the</b> material world. <b>Mind</b> <b>was</b> no longer an integral part of worldly activity. Rather, mind had disengaged from the world.|$|R
25|$|An {{object of}} <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> {{an object that}} exists in the imagination, but which, in the real world, can only be {{represented}} or modeled. Some such objects are mathematical abstractions, literary concepts, or fictional scenarios.|$|E
25|$|Mind against context. <b>The</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> both {{a machine}} and an anti-machine; {{it is both}} formulaic and totalizing. Thus we never rest in any context, {{and we need to}} have {{arrangements}} that constantly lend themselves to reinvention.|$|E
25|$|According to dualism, <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> non-physical (or, at {{the very}} least, has non-physical properties) and, therefore, cannot be {{explained}} in purely physical terms. According to materialism, the mind can be explained physically, which leaves open the possibility of minds that are produced artificially.|$|E
