However, <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> culture process for this slow-growing organism can take two to six weeks for blood or sputum culture. Thus, treatment is often begun before cultures are confirmed.|$|E

But <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> {{weather and}} bright summer light (which made filming difficult) dissuaded them, {{and the production}} settled on Alaska instead. Freuchen accompanied the production not only as an actor, but as an interpreter as well.|$|E
5|$|Brotherhood {{was made}} {{as part of}} a planned {{multimedia}} expansion of Final Fantasy XV without the need to develop a series of games. The series was conceived by Ofuji in 2014, based on his wish to expand upon an in-game reference to <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> childhood of one of the characters. The story focuses on themes of brotherhood and friendship, and was designed to give players glimpses into the personal lives and personalities of the characters that would not have fitted within the game.|$|E

5|$|By now, the {{division}} {{was too weak}} to attempt to reach Frost at the bridge. Of the nine infantry battalions, only one (1st Battalion, The Border Regiment) still existed as a unit, the rest were badly mauled or scattered. Urquhart made <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> decision to form a defensive perimeter around Oosterbeek, abandoning the 2nd Parachute Battalion. By securing the Driel Ferry Crossing, Urquhart hoped to hold out until XXX Corps could reach them and establish a new bridgehead over the Rhine using the ferry crossing platforms.|$|E

In 1949, they also won the first Copa Latina. In June 1950, Barcelona signed Ladislao Kubala, who was to be an important figure at the club.|$|E
50|$|Iván García is {{a talented}} diver who can dive <b>the</b> most <b>difficult</b> dives {{all over the}} world. He has {{mastered}} a series of <b>the</b> most <b>difficult</b> dives since 2012.

Iván García is able to dive either <b>the</b> most <b>difficult</b> dive or <b>the</b> second most <b>difficult</b> dive {{in each of the}} six diving groups(forward, backward, reverse, inward, twisting and armstand groups). Among these dives,409C is <b>the</b> most <b>difficult</b> dive being used all over the world currently. In 2012 London Olympic Games, Iván García finished his difficult dives with his partner Germán Sánchez to an almost perfect extent, which awarded them a silver Olympic medal-the best performance of Mexicans in synchronized diving.

5|$|In {{building}} the pipeline, engineers faced {{a wide range}} of difficulties, stemming mainly from the extreme cold and <b>the</b> <b>difficult,</b> isolated terrain. The construction of the pipeline {{was one of the first}} large-scale projects to deal with problems caused by permafrost, and special construction techniques had to be developed to cope with the frozen ground. The project attracted tens of thousands of workers to Alaska, causing a boomtown atmosphere in Valdez, Fairbanks, and Anchorage.|$|E

It swallows small stones, as do all rails, to help break up its food in the gizzard.|$|E
5|$|The railway was {{constructed}} by the South Eastern Railway in the early 1850s across <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> terrain of the High Weald.

5|$|A {{number of}} new sects {{appeared}} in Japan in the 12th and 13th centuries as a natural reaction to <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> teachings of older schools and partially motivated by the notion of mappō. Growing out of an Amida cult, the Jōdo Shinshū Pure Land school was founded in 1224 by Shinran, and attracted a following from all classes and occupations. Three years later, Dōgen introduced the Sōtō school of Zen Buddhism emphasizing meditation and dharma practice. The first truly Japanese school of Buddhism goes back to Nichiren's proclamation of his teachings in 1253. Nichiren Buddhism was exceptional for being militant and intolerant. The central focus of Nichiren's teaching was the veneration of the Lotus Sutra.|$|E
