5|$|Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) {{continues}} to struggle in deciphering an encrypted Starfleet {{message that they}} previously obtained through the Hirogen relay system (""). Neelix (Ethan Phillips) returns to Voyager with a guest, Arturis (Ray Wise), who helped him obtain supplies. Arturis learns of the encoded message and offers to help decrypt it. He is successful, and finds that <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>is</b> from Starfleet Command, with a nearby set of coordinates where their means of getting back home can be found. Though {{the rest of the}} crew is elated at this news, Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) remains cautious, given that the Borg have never been able to assimilate Arturis' species. Voyager arrives at the provided coordinates to find an unmanned Starfleet vessel, the Dauntless, of unknown design. Aboard, they find the ship uses quantum slipstream technology, which will allow them to arrive back in the Alpha Quadrant within a few months.|$|E
5|$|Later, a huge onboard {{television}} screen displays an emergency message {{from a military}} officer, warning the crew and passengers about a deadly virus that has started to spread on the mainland. He says that all ships must remain at sea to ensure that humanity survives. <b>The</b> <b>message</b> <b>is</b> actually taken from a movie in the Simpson cabin's DVD library, set up by Bart to broadcast all over the ship. He also disables communications with the mainland by pouring hot fudge on a control panel. As the ship stays at sea, conditions deteriorate and the food supply starts to run out. Eventually, the cruise turns into a post-apocalyptic civilization, with gladiator arenas, marauders, capital punishment, and Priddis claiming kingship over the passengers.|$|E

50|$|Erlich gained his {{access to}} the Internet through {{defendant}} Tom Klemesrud's bulletin board service ("BBS"), which had approximately 500 paying users. Klemesrud's BBS {{was linked to the}} Internet through the facilities of defendant Netcom. When Erlich posted messages to Usenet, he transmitted his messages to Klemesrud's computer using a telephone and a modem, and <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> <b>were</b> briefly stored on Klemesrud's computer. Then <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> <b>were</b> automatically copied from Klemesrud's computer to Netcom's computers and other computers on the Usenet according to a prearranged pattern. Once <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> <b>were</b> on Netcom's computers, they were available to Netcom's customers to download. <b>The</b> <b>messages</b> <b>were</b> stored on Netcom's system for eleven days and Klemesrud's system for three days.|$|R
25|$|When {{computer}} programs display messages that alert the user, an exclamation mark may be shown alongside it {{to indicate that}} <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>is</b> important and should be read. This often happens when an error is made, or to obtain user consent for hazardous operations such as deleting data.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>message</b> <b>is</b> conceptually zero-bit {{long and}} the system is {{designed}} in order to detect the presence or {{the absence of the}} watermark in the marked object. This kind of watermarking scheme is usually referred to as zero-bit or presence watermarking schemes. Sometimes, this type of watermarking scheme is called 1-bit watermark, because a 1 denotes the presence (and a 0 the absence) of a watermark.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>message</b> <b>is</b> {{included}} in the Order of Business. If the Congress decides to override the veto, the House and the Senate shall proceed separately to reconsider the bill or the vetoed items of the bill.

30|$|The FG {{contains}} both discrete {{and continuous}} <b>messages.</b> <b>The</b> discrete <b>messages</b> <b>are</b> presented in <b>the</b> coder. There {{is no need}} for the investigation of their representation, because they are exactly represented by PMF.Several parameterizable continuous <b>messages</b> might <b>be</b> exactly represented using a straightforward parameterization (e.g., Gaussian <b>message).</b> These <b>messages</b> <b>are</b> presented in <b>the</b> AWGN channel model. The rest of <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> <b>are</b> mixed continuous and discrete messages. These mixture <b>messages</b> <b>are</b> continuously valued <b>messages</b> without an obvious way of their representation. <b>The</b> <b>messages</b> <b>are</b> situated in <b>the</b> phase model.|$|R
25|$|Storytelling {{also serves}} {{to deliver a}} {{particular}} message during spiritual and ceremonial functions. In the ceremonial use of storytelling, the unity building theme of the message becomes {{more important than the}} time, place and characters of the message. Once <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>is</b> delivered, the story is finished. As cycles of the tale are told and retold, story units can recombine, showing various outcomes for a person's actions.|$|E
25|$|A private message, or PM for short, is {{a message}} sent in private from a member {{to one or more}} other members. The ability to send {{so-called}} blind carbon copies is sometimes available. When sending a blind carbon copy (bcc), the users to whom <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>is</b> sent directly will not be aware of the recipients of the blind carbon copy or even if one was sent in the first place.|$|E

50|$|A digital {{signature}} is a mathematical scheme for demonstrating {{the authenticity of}} digital messages or documents. A valid {{digital signature}} gives a recipient {{reason to believe that}} <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>was</b> created by a known sender (authentication), that the sender cannot deny having sent <b>the</b> <b>message</b> (non-repudiation), and that <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>was</b> not altered in transit (integrity).|$|R
25|$|According to a {{publication}} by the American Foreign Policy Council, the proverb {{in the form}} 'After Saturday, Sunday', was brandished as a popular slogan among supporters of Haj Amin al-Husseini's faction during the 1936â€“39 Arab revolt in Palestine. <b>The</b> <b>message</b> <b>is</b> reported to have meant that once the Jews had been driven out, the Christians would be expelled. The authority for this is Benny Morris, who, however, does not identify al-Husseini's faction in this context, and provides no source for the claim it was popular in Palestine at that period.|$|E
25|$|PGP {{can be used}} to send {{messages}} confidentially. For this, PGP combines symmetric-key encryption and public-key encryption. <b>The</b> <b>message</b> <b>is</b> encrypted using a symmetric encryption algorithm, which requires a symmetric key. Each symmetric key is used only once and is also called a session key. The message and its session key are sent to the receiver. The session key must be sent to the receiver so they know how to decrypt the message, but to protect it during transmission it is encrypted with the receiver's public key. Only the private key belonging to the receiver can decrypt the session key.|$|E
25|$|Cave arrows, Line arrows or Dorff markers (after Lewis Holtzendorff) are plastic {{arrowhead}} markers {{which are}} hooked onto a cave line by wrapping the line around the arrow through the slots. They {{are used to}} indicate the direction to the exit, and can be identified by feel. <b>The</b> <b>message</b> <b>is</b> simple, but of critical importance, as if a diver does not know {{which way to go}} at a line junction there is a risk of serious trouble. Line arrows are also used at a junction on the permanent line, and at a tie-off, so when the diver gets back to the tie-off, he or she can identify which way to turn.|$|E

5000|$|The IFSF {{standards}} define messages sent {{and received}} by {{each type of}} device. <b>The</b> <b>messages</b> <b>are</b> designed to be expandable by specifying individual fields with types and lengths. <b>The</b> <b>messages</b> <b>are</b> grouped into various [...] "databases" [...] for the logical parts of each device, such as a nozzle at a pump.|$|R
25|$|In Christianity {{a prophet}} (or seer) is one {{inspired}} by God through the Holy Spirit {{to deliver a}} message for a specific purpose. God's calling as a prophet is not to elevate an individual for their own glory, but for the glory of God and to turn people to him. Some Christian denominations limit a prophet's message to those only to the entire church congregation and exclude personal messages not intended for the body of believers, but in the Bible {{on a number of}} occasions prophets were called to deliver personal messages. The reception of a message is termed revelation and the delivery of <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>is</b> termed prophecy.|$|E
25|$|According to Malhotra, Dharmic traditions rely on adhyatma-vidya, {{while the}} Abrahamic {{religions}} rely on God's interventions in human history. For followers of history-centric (Abrahamic) religions, truth-claims based on history are {{more significant than}} the scriptural message itself. History-centric dogma such as original sin and resurrection become critical beliefs and no compromise can be made on their acceptance. This explains the centrality of Nicene creed to all major Christian denominations. Followers of history-centric religions believe that the God revealed His message through a special prophet and that <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>is</b> secured in scriptures. This special access to God is available only to these intermediaries or prophets and not to any other human beings.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>message</b> <b>is</b> {{taken to}} the Samaritans, a people {{rejected}} by Jews, and to the Gentiles. Saul of Tarsus, one of the Jews who persecuted the Christians, is converted by a vision to become a follower of Christ (an event which Luke regards as so important that he relates it three times). Peter, directed {{by a series of}} visions, preaches to Cornelius the Centurion, a Gentile God-fearer, who becomes a follower of Christ. The Holy Spirit descends on Peter and Cornelius, thus confirming that the message of eternal life in Christ is for all mankind. The Gentile church is established in Antioch (north-western Syria, the third-largest city of the empire), and here Christ's followers are first called Christians.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technical}} problem: how accurately can <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>be</b> transmitted? ...|$|R
50|$|At <b>the</b> {{level of}} <b>message</b> passing, {{transient}} communication means the way by which <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> <b>are</b> not saved into a buffer {{to wait for}} its delivery at <b>the</b> <b>message</b> receiver. <b>The</b> <b>messages</b> will <b>be</b> delivered only if both the systems (sender and receiver) are running. If the receiver is not running at the send time, <b>the</b> <b>message</b> will <b>be</b> discarded, because {{it has not been}} stored into intermediate buffers.|$|R

25|$|One {{limitation}} of the technology {{appears to be the}} total informational capacity of the superposition statesâ€”each instance of communication makes subsequent attempts more difficult in an effect described similarly to the build-up of static interference. It is unknown whether this limitation holds only for each individual repeat participant (which seems more likely) or for the entire process independent of the participants. Also never explicitly stated is the exact effect of the process' acausal nature, though it is implied that it cannot be used to directly violate causality. Instead, each use of the Exordium creates a new timeline in which <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>is</b> received. The original timeline in which the message was sent continues as before.|$|E
25|$|A codon {{is a set}} {{of three}} nucleotides, a triplet that code for a certain amino acid. The first codon {{establishes}} the reading frame, whereby a new codon begins. A proteinâ€²s amino acid backbone sequence is defined by contiguous triplets. Codons are key to translation of genetic information for the synthesis of proteins. The reading frame is set when translating the mRNA begins and is maintained as it reads one triplet to the next. The reading of the genetic code is subject to three rules the monitor codons in mRNA. First, codons are read in a 5' to 3' direction. Second, codons are nonoverlapping and the message has no gaps. The last rule, as stated above, that <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>is</b> translated in a fixed reading frame.|$|E
25|$|Acts and the Gospel of Luke make up {{a two-part}} work, Lukeâ€“Acts, by the same {{anonymous}} author, usually dated to around 80â€“90 AD. The first part, the Gospel of Luke, tells how God fulfilled his plan for the world's salvation through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, the promised Messiah. Acts continues the story of Christianity in the 1st century, beginning with Jesus's Ascension to Heaven. The early chapters, set in Jerusalem, describe the Day of Pentecost (the coming of the Holy Spirit) {{and the growth of}} the church in Jerusalem. Initially, the Jews are receptive to the Christian message, but soon they turn against the followers of Jesus. Rejected by the Jews, under the guidance of the Apostle Peter <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>is</b> taken to the Gentiles. The later chapters tell of Paul's conversion, his mission in Asia Minor and the Aegean, and finally his imprisonment in Rome, where, as the book ends, he awaits trial.|$|E
5000|$|Outgoing {{messages}} do {{not contain}} the explicit address of the recipient of <b>the</b> <b>message.</b> Therefore, every network participant attempts decryption of every <b>message</b> passing through <b>the</b> network even if <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>was</b> not originally intended for that network participant. Since only the actual recipient can successfully decrypt <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> intended for them, all network participants {{know that if they}} fail to decrypt <b>the</b> <b>message</b> then <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>was</b> not intended for them.|$|R
