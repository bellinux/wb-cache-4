He began selling his coffee in 1909 and founded a company to manufacture it in 1910. Based in New York and New Jersey, his company prospered and became an important military supplier during World War I. The company's products were also advertised in New York newspapers and on the radio.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{interaction}} between the <b>tax</b> <b>authority,</b> <b>tax</b> payers, and potential informants in a game theoretic framework. The <b>tax</b> <b>authority</b> gives monetary incentives to informants, and conducts random tax audits. The probability of a tax payer being audited depends on whether the <b>tax</b> <b>authority</b> received a tip about him from an informant or not. In subgame perfect equilibrium tax payers are divided into (at most) two groups. Those with income up to a certain level evade a small amount of taxes to assure that potential informants do not have sufficient incentives to report, and those with high incomes choose to declare zero income knowing that they will be reported by informants. The <b>tax</b> <b>authority</b> chooses the probabilities of the two types of audits, under a budget constraint. In many cases the probabilities are chosen in a way that no informant actually reported, and in some cases the <b>tax</b> <b>authority</b> does not conduct any audits. ...|$|R

He had politely declined on behalf of the group, as it was their policy never to accept such official invitations. The Beatles and their entourage were ejected from their hotel on the same day and given a police escort to the airport, even though Epstein had publicly apologised for the misunderstanding in a televised statement, which was not seen or heard because of static. The entourage boarded the plane for home, but Epstein and Beatles' assistant Mal Evans were ordered off, both believing {{that they would not be}} allowed back on the plane.

Firstly, it explores how small business taxpayers are treated (procedural fairness) when audited by the <b>tax</b> <b>authority.</b> Secondly, it discusses {{their perception of}} the <b>tax</b> <b>authority.</b> Using a qualitative approach, this research applies case studies and in-depth semi structured face to face interviews with small business participants. The findings clearly suggest that procedural fairness experienced by small business taxpayers and their perceptions of the <b>tax</b> <b>authority</b> determine the extent of their compliance cooperation. Additionally, small business taxpayers&# 039; perception of the <b>tax</b> <b>authority</b> can also influence the tax authority&# 039;s legitimacy to regulate the small business sector.

Drawing from fairness heuristic theory and the slippery slope framework of tax compliance, we predicted that procedural justice fosters voluntary tax compliance, particularly when legitimate power of the <b>tax</b> <b>authority</b> is low and when coercive power of the authority is high. Moreover, we predicted that these interactive effects are mediated by (cognition-based) trust. Finally, we predicted that coercive power of the <b>tax</b> <b>authority</b> is positively related with enforced tax compliance.

40|$|Following {{the classic}} {{economic}} model of tax evasion, taxpayers base their tax decisions on economic determinants, like fine rate and audit probability. Empirical {{findings on the}} relationship between economic key determinants and tax evasion are inconsistent and suggest that taxpayers may rather rely on their beliefs about <b>tax</b> <b>authority’s</b> power. Descriptions of the <b>tax</b> <b>authority’s</b> power may affect taxpayers’ beliefs and as such tax evasion. Experiment 1 investigates the impact of fines and beliefs regarding <b>tax</b> <b>authority’s</b> power on <b>tax</b> evasion. Experiments 2 - 4 are conducted to examine the effect of varying descriptions about a <b>tax</b> <b>authority’s</b> power on participants’ beliefs and respective tax evasion. It is investigated whether tax evasion is influenced by the description of an authority wielding coercive power (Experiment 2), legitimate power (Experiment 3), and coercive and legitimate power combined (Experiment 4). Further, it is examined whether a contrast of the description of power (low to high power; high to low power) impacts tax evasion (Experiments 2 - 4). Results show that the amount of fine does not impact tax payments, whereas participants’ beliefs regarding <b>tax</b> <b>authority’s</b> power significantly shape compliance decisions. Descriptions of high coercive power as well as high legitimate power affect beliefs about <b>tax</b> <b>authority’s</b> power and positively impact tax honesty. This effect still holds if both qualities of power are applied simultaneously. The contrast of descriptions has little impact on tax evasion. The current study indicates that descriptions of the <b>tax</b> <b>authority,</b> e. g., in information brochures and media reports, have more influence on beliefs and tax payments than information on fine rates. Methodically, these considerations become particularly important when descriptions or vignettes are used besides objective information...|$|R

40|$|Background {{and problem}} The {{statutory}} audit for small LLCs in Sweden was removed in 2010. The Swedish <b>Tax</b> <b>Authority</b> raised many concerns before the legislative change, {{but since then}} they have not voiced their opinions regarding its effects. They lost a tool {{to ensure that the}} information that they receive from the company is correct, but it is unclear how this has affected their work processes. Aims of study The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the Swedish <b>Tax</b> <b>Authority’s</b> current views on the legislative change. Also, the subject of the value of the external audit and how it might have an effect on the information asymmetry that can arise in the Principal-Agent relationship between the Swedish <b>Tax</b> <b>Authority</b> and the Swedish LLCs. Research questions How has the abrogation of the statutory audit for small LLCs affected the Swedish <b>Tax</b> <b>Authority?</b> Is the external audit useful to redress the information asymmetry between the Swedish <b>Tax</b> <b>Authority</b> and the Swedish companies? Methodology A qualitative study with individual interviews with five employees at the Swedish <b>Tax</b> <b>Authority</b> and one interview with the Chief Legal Officer at the Swedish Companies Registration Office. In addition to this a selection of articles, on the value of audit as well as on the subject of the abrogation in different EU member states, have been studied. Analysis and conclusion The abrogation of the statutory audit has not affected the Swedish <b>Tax</b> <b>Authority</b> as much as they feared it would. The General Accounting Controls, that were concurrently implemented, is perceived to be more beneficial than the external audit. The most important tool to redress the information asymmetry is a continuous contact between the company and an objective external party with relevant knowledge in accounting and in the company.
