25|$|In Canada Call signs {{start with}} VA, VE, VY, VO, and CY. Call signs {{starting}} with 'V' {{end with a}} number after to indicate the political region; prefix CY indicates geographic islands. Prefix VA1 or VE1 is Nova Scotia, VA2 / VE2 is Quebec, VA3 / VE3 is Ontario, VA4 / VE4 is Manitoba, VA5 / VE5 is Saskatchewan, VA6 / VE6 is Alberta, VA7 / VE7 is British Columbia, VE8 is the Northwest Territories, VE9 is New Brunswick, VY0 is Nunavut, VY1 is the Yukon Territory, VY2 is Prince Edward Island, VO1 is Newfoundland, and VO2 is Labrador. CY is for amateurs operating from Sable and/or St. Paul’s Island, both of which require coast guard permission to get to. CY0 is Sable Island and CY9 is St. Paul’s Island. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> letters of the callsigns are typically the operator's choice (upon completing the licensing test, the ham writes three most-preferred options). Two letter callsign suffixes require a ham to have already been licensed for 5years. Callsigns in Canada can be requested with a fee.|$|E

25|$|The term “thangata” has {{had several}} {{meanings}} in Malawi {{in the last}} 120 years, and its traditional or pre-colonial use {{was very different from}} its uses in colonial and modern times. The word exists in the Chewa and the related Mang'anja languages, and its first pre-colonial meaning was “help” or “to assist”, in the sense of freely-given reciprocal help such as neighbours might give each other building huts or clearing fields. It also had the meaning of the agricultural work that a member of the village community did for his chief. The ownership of land in much of Malawi was vested in the community, not individuals. Traditional leaders acted as trustees over communal land, and granted the right to use it to individuals in their communities. By custom, these leaders received in gifts in kind or labour from those in their community who had benefitted. This was also called thangata. When communal land was plentiful, community leaders could not demand thangata, but once it became scarcer in the colonial period, and particularly after the introduction of Indirect rule on 1933, the chiefs could impose a condition of thangata work on any grant. In <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> decades, chiefs have begun to require cash sums or rents to allow the use of communal land, but these cash payments are not called thangata.|$|E

500|$|Ahead of the 2007–08 season, Bristol City manager Gary Johnson stated his {{intention}} to send Myrie-Williams out on loan {{in order to gain}} more first-team experience. Johnson believed that Myrie-Williams would only benefit from a loan move to a League One club, given that he was playing in the third tier of English football prior to Bristol City's promotion to the Championship during the 2006–07 campaign. Two days {{before the start of the}} 2007–08 season, Myrie-Williams joined Cheltenham Town on a month's loan. He made his debut for Cheltenham in the club's 1–0 home win against Gillingham on the first day of the season, coming on as a substitute in the 68th minute. Myrie-Williams made a further substitute appearance in a 1–0 defeat at Millwall a week later, before starting his first game in a 1–1 draw with Swindon Town on 25 August 2007. After making four first-team appearances for Cheltenham, Myrie-Williams' loan was extended for a further month, running until 6 October 2007. Cheltenham Town manager John Ward said [...] "I am really pleased that Jennison will be staying with us. In <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> games he has started to show his tremendous pace and ability on the ball". His loan was extended yet again in October 2007, taking him into a third month with Cheltenham. He scored his first goal for Cheltenham in a 3–1 away win at Swindon Town in the Football League Trophy, scoring the first goal of the game, [...] "finishing neatly after a superb through ball from Craig Reid". He made his final appearance for Cheltenham in a 2–2 home draw with Crewe Alexandra, coming on as a substitute as Cheltenham scored two late goals to salvage a point. After the game, Myrie-Williams suffered a knee injury in training, ruling him out of first-team action for two weeks. He made 13 appearances for Cheltenham during his three-month loan spell, scoring one goal— he returned to his parent club in early November 2007.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{proposed}} explanations for {{why people are}} susceptible to the hot-hand fallacy. Alan D. Castel, and others investigated the idea that age would alter an individual's belief in the fallacy. To test this idea researchers conducted a cross-sectional study where they sampled 455 participants {{ranging in age from}} 22 to 90 years old. These participants were given a questionnaire preceded by a prompt that said in college and professional basketball games no players make 100% of their attempted shots. Then the questionnaire asked two important questions: (1) Does a basketball player {{have a better chance of}} making a shot after having just made <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> shots than after having missed <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> shots?

2500|$|One {{problem is}} {{in regard to}} the {{semantic}} difficulty of deciding the precise meaning of [...] "human". A population of, say, 4 million, with an average lifespan of, say, 10 years (see below), implies a birthrate of 0.4 million per year, which over a period of 100000 years represents 40000 million people. Also, robust population data only exists for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> centuries. Until the late 18th century, few governments had ever performed an accurate census. In many early attempts, such as in Ancient Egypt and the Persian Empire, the focus was on counting merely a subset of the population for purposes of taxation or military service. Thus, there is a significant margin of error when estimating ancient global populations.|$|E
