5|$|Olivia worries it {{will happen}} again, and though she {{attempts}} to ward off sleep, she next dreams that she helps a woman murder her husband at a restaurant. They interview the wife, who tells them she became so convinced her husband {{was going to leave}} her that she became angry and stabbed him. The team posits that while no one is actually causing the incidents, they are happening as Olivia has seen them. At the restaurant, the owner tells them a blond man with a scar named Nick Lane (David Call) was sitting in the same place as Olivia was in her dream, and was also seen in the video surveillance from the first crime scene. Walter posits <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> never sees him in her dreams, it was Lane, not Olivia, causing the people's deaths. Olivia and Peter interview doctors at St. Jude's Mental Hospital, who tell them Lane was a voluntary resident, but left after the visit of a mysterious man. The doctor described him as hyperemotive, meaning those near him adopt his emotions. Olivia and Peter soon learn that as a child, Lane was treated with the nootropic drug Cortexiphan in drug trials, and believes himself to be a recruit in the upcoming war between the two universes.|$|E

25|$|This love {{triangle}} soon {{becomes a}} love square when Hikari discovers that Hazuki also has feelings for Takaaki Ooishi. Now {{they are not}} only friends, but also rivals in sport and love. Hikari does not know how Ooishi feels about her, and she is always a bit nervous when he is around. She feels <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> has yet to be the best rhythmic gymnast, Ooishi might fall for Shiina because of her gymnastic skills and talent. Hikari begins to perfect her skills, and is soon competing at the national and international level, where she meets new rivals.|$|E

25|$|In an {{interview}} in 2007, Whitman stated that Vice President Dick Cheney's insistence on easing air pollution controls, not the personal reasons she cited at the time, led to her resignation. At the time, Cheney pushed the EPA to institute a new rule allowing power plants to make major alterations without installing costly new pollution controls. Whitman stepped down in protest against such demand by the White House, she said. She decided <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> {{did not agree with}} the rule, she {{would not be able to}} defend it if it were to be challenged in a legal action. The federal court eventually overturned the rule on the ground that it violated the Clean Air Act.|$|E
25|$|Todd argues that, in {{addition}} to patriarchal prejudice, Behn suffered for her dismissal of any liberal agenda. Going against the tide of the times, she believed in the divine right of kings and aristocratic hierarchies. Todd writes that Behn was contemptuous of democracy and the common man in the street, not expressly interested in human rights — for women or slaves or anyone else — and <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> did not support {{any kind of a}} liberal agenda, her causes were not cheered by the progressives. She does not easily fit into any mould of proto-feminism. She had come into adulthood, following the English Civil War, under the harsh puritan rule of the Restoration, and regarded political populism as a sign of moral collapse and the triumph of venality.|$|E
25|$|If Hecate's cult {{spread from}} Anatolia into Greece, it is {{possible}} it presented a conflict, as her role was already filled by other more prominent deities in the Greek pantheon, above all by Artemis and Selene. This line of reasoning lies behind the widely accepted hypothesis {{that she was a}} foreign deity who was incorporated into the Greek pantheon. Other than in the Theogony, the Greek sources do not offer a consistent story of her parentage, or of her relations in the Greek pantheon: sometimes Hecate is related as a Titaness, and a mighty helper and protector of humans. Her continued presence was explained by asserting <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> was the only Titan who aided Zeus in the battle of gods and Titans, she was not banished into the underworld realms after their defeat by the Olympians.|$|E

She's always there--and if she can't be there herself, her diamonds are. Now you can't make {{anything out of}} that but just sheer luck." ...|$|R
50|$|It is the {{day before}} Joleen's 14th birthday. When they stop in the Banco Supermarket, they notice that there's no one behind the counter, but Sheriff Bill Childers (Dick Miller) is in the store. When Joleen looks behind the counter, <b>she</b> screams. <b>That's</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> sees {{the body of the}} store's owner, Ferrell Hovis, in a pool of blood.|$|R
25|$|When Gaston {{arrived to}} the Pawn Shop, he aims {{at what he}} thought was Gold but discovers a {{mannequin}} instead. He is then confronted by Belle, who now knows he was willing to kill Rumple and believed he still had feelings for her, only to learn that the book was punishment and a constant reminder of why he died. He was also shocked to discover Belle is now Gold's wife, and leaves furious. Belle tells Gold and made him promise not to hurt Gaston, but when she tells Gold about what Hades told her he just couldn't accept what Belle wanted. At the docks, Gold uses magic to choke Gaston by the throat, ready to send him to the River of Lost Souls, when Belle pulls the dagger and commands him not to hurt Gaston, and he drops Gaston on the ground. However, Gaston is unable to let his vendetta against Gold go, and when he goes for his arrow, Belle accidentally knockes Gaston out into the River of Lost Souls. Unfortunately, Belle discovers <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> saved Gold but interfered, Hades arrives to tell the couple that the contract allowing him to take their baby was still in effect, as Belle was the one who knocked Gaston into the Acheron, not Gold. He then looks at a withering daisy flower that he picks up, as a sign of hope fading away. The burned flower later shows up at Granny's Diner, as a gift to Zelena from Hades.|$|E
500|$|Leopold {{was devoted}} to his sons, {{and much of the}} wealth Caroline {{inherited}} went to the two; she once reportedly boasted <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> was able to marry the king, her sons were in better standings than Charles Beauclerk, 1st Duke of St Albans, the illegitimate son of Nell Gwyn and Charles II of England. Because of these gifts, Caroline was loathed by the Belgian public; on one occasion, her carriage was stoned on the streets of Brussels.|$|E

Because Lydia's really deranged, Lydia starts {{thinking}} <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> loved Sarah and Sarah loved Zoe, {{if she gets}} with Zoe, that'll be the final piece in the puzzle and it'll all work out." [...] She explained: [...] "Lydia starts becoming obsessed with Zoe and to keep control, Zoe has to go with it. There's a point where Lydia kisses her! And then Mike walks in and kicks Zoe out." ...|$|E

500|$|With the {{cancellation}} of Veronica Mars, Variety reported that attaining Bell was a [...] "major, major coup for NBC" [...] because of how in-demand the actress was. [...] Universal Media Studios' Katherine Pope noted that [...] "many studios [...] chasing [...] in both film and TV" [...] and that Pope was happy that Bell [...] "chose to star in our show." [...] When Bell was cast, Tim Kring explained <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> had known several of the cast members for years {{as well as some}} of the writers, it [...] "was already like part of the family by the time we cast her." ...|$|E
500|$|After Zoe is {{released}} from prison and is found not guilty of Sarah's murder, {{it is believed that}} Sarah committed suicide after her diary, found by Mike Barnes (Tony Hirst) is used as evidence in court. Soon Lydia starts to befriend Zoe and she ends up moving in with the Barnes family where Lydia now lives and soon Zoe plans too uncover Lydia's murderous ways as she {{does not want to be}} known as a killer. In an interview with entertainment website Digital Spy, Lister said of the storyline, [...] "It all gets really messy from here! Because Lydia's really deranged, Lydia starts thinking <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> loved Sarah and Sarah loved Zoe, if she gets with Zoe, that'll be the final piece in the puzzle and it'll all work out." ...|$|E
500|$|American Cyanamid {{biochemist}} Robert White-Stevens {{and former}} Cyanamid chemist Thomas Jukes {{were among the}} most aggressive critics, especially of Carson's analysis of DDT. According to White-Stevens, [...] "If man were to follow the teachings of Miss Carson, we would return to the Dark Ages, and the insects and diseases and vermin would once again inherit the earth." [...] Others went further, attacking Carson's scientific credentials (because her training was in marine biology rather than biochemistry) and her personal character. White-Stevens labeled her [...] "...a fanatic defender of the cult of the balance of nature," [...] while former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson—in a letter to former President Dwight D. Eisenhower—reportedly concluded <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> was unmarried despite being physically attractive, she was [...] "probably a Communist." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2005, Vulović's {{fall was}} recreated by the American {{television}} program MythBusters, which concluded that surviving such a plunge was unlikely but plausible. Four years later, Peter Hornung-Andersen and Pavel Theiner, two Prague-based journalists, claimed that Flight 367 had been mistaken for an enemy aircraft and {{shot down by}} the Czechoslovak Air Force {{at an altitude of}} [...] The two claimed that the Czechoslovak State Security had conjured up Vulović's record fall as part of a cover-up. They hypothesized that the call received by the Kvällsposten, claiming responsibility for the aircraft's downing, was a hoax. The Czech Civil Aviation Authority dismissed the journalists' claim, calling it a conspiracy theory. Hornung-Andersen conceded that the pair's evidence was only circumstantial. Vulović said that she was aware of the journalists' claims, but stated <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> had no memory of the event, she could not confirm or deny the allegations. Guinness World Records continues to list her as the record-holder for surviving the highest fall without a parachute.|$|E
500|$|According to {{observations}} by Kerry Carrington and Andrew Johnson, media {{references to}} Leigh being sexually assaulted [...] "almost completely disappeared" [...] {{in less than}} a year, as did the references to her being assaulted by the group of boys. They stated that the fact that NC1 was not charged with raping Leigh had created the legal fiction that his sex with her was consensual. The [...] "unsustainable assumption" [...] that Leigh consented to sex was the turning point in her being blamed for her own assault and murder on the grounds <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> was supposedly sexually promiscuous, Leigh had somehow [...] "asked for [...] ". In addition to sexual promiscuity and the lack of parental supervision, Carrington states that media attention also shifted to the presence of drugs and alcohol at the party; Morrow and San Roque credit media attention to these factors as taking attention away from the abuse that Leigh suffered before she died. The epithet slut in a pretrial psychological report also became a topic of focus for the media: ...|$|E
500|$|Her first {{match was}} in the Round of 32, which was an {{elimination}} round, on 3 August, the seventh day of competition at the Olympics. [...] Wearing white, she lost to Puerto Rican Melissa Mojica in 82 seconds, lasting longer than the shortest match in her weight class, which lasted 48 seconds where Mika Sugimoto of Japan beat Maria Suelen Altheman of Brazil. The match was refereed by Wilian Rosquet, and judged by Young Chun Jeon and Cathy Mouette. [...] There were no penalties awarded in the match. After the match, {{she said to the}} press (in Arabic): [...] "I am happy to be at the Olympics. Unfortunately, we did not win a medal, but in the future we will and I will be a star for women's participation." [...] She also stated <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> was not accustomed to fighting in such large tournaments and because of the debate over the hijab, it had been difficult for her to focus on the competition. Despite this, she clarified that she was happy to have participated and planned to continue to practise judo in the future. Although her fight was not televised live on any local Saudi television channels, it was available within the Kingdom on several satellite networks broadcasting {{from other parts of the}} Arab world.|$|E

500|$|Some critics, used to more {{prescriptive}} cookery writers, {{thought her}} approach assumed too much knowledge {{on the part}} of the reader. In her view, [...] "The ideal cookery writer is one who makes his readers want to cook as well as telling them how it is done; he should leave something, not too much perhaps, but a little, unsaid: people must make their own discoveries, use their own intelligence, otherwise they will be deprived of part of the fun." [...] In The New York Times Craig Claiborne wrote admiringly of David, but remarked <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> assumed her readers already knew the basics of cooking she would be [...] "valued more by those with a serious regard for food than by those with a casual interest". [...] The writer Julian Barnes commented that as an amateur cook he found David's terse instructions intimidating: of a recipe in Italian Food [...] he wrote, [...] "E.D.'s first sentence reads like this: 'Melt 1½ lbs (675 g) chopped and skinned tomatoes in olive oil'... Melt? Melt a tomato?... Could it be that Elizabeth David was too good a writer to be a food writer?". A later cook, Tom Parker Bowles, observes, [...] "You don't turn to Elizabeth David for nannying, step-by-step instruction, or precise amounts and timing. She assumes you know the basics, and is a writer who offers inspiration, and wonderful, opinionated prose. Her recipes are timeless, and all her books wonderful works of reference (and tirelessly researched) as well as beautiful reads." ...|$|E
500|$|Swift {{commenced}} composing [...] "White Horse" [...] {{almost a}} year before the release of Fearless, weeks after composing Fearless lead single [...] "Love Story", songs which are quite disparate lyrically. Swift first solely wrote the first verse. She then made a phone call to Liz Rose, co-writer of most tracks on Swift's eponymous debut studio album, Taylor Swift (2006), asking for her aid in finishing the song; the two completed writing the song in approximately forty-five minutes. The song was inspired by a boyfriend of Swift's who she perceived to be a Prince Charming and, in the downfall of the relationship, then realized he was not. She said he was the person who triggered the song, but, once in the midst of writing it, drifted in direction. It focused on the initial moment where she recognized the relationship was over. She said everything after that particular moment centered on recuperation and, because of that, considered it the most solemn aspect of a breakup: [...] "To me, 'White Horse' is about what, in my opinion, is the most heart-breaking part of a break-up – that moment when you realize that all the dreams you had, all those visions you had of being with this person, all that disappears." [...] About the difference in themes between [...] "White Horse" [...] and [...] "Love Story", Swift explained that in divergent scenarios, she regarded fairytales in different manners. She attributed the fact <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> did not expect to go through the event, then she became more inclined to come in terms with reality.|$|E
