5|$|At {{one meeting}} in October 1853, he shared the {{platform}} with John B. Horsfall and Chartist leader Ernest Jones, whose Labour Parliament Grimshaw {{was involved in}} the following year as one of the two delegates from Preston, along with Wallace Beever. The Labour Parliament was partly a response to a lock-out of around 20,000 mill workers by <b>the</b> <b>employers</b> in Preston; its aim was to organise a levy on wages to support operatives who went on strike or were locked out. Those paying the levy were to elect a committee to buy and look after land and factories and the Parliament would meet on a yearly basis. However, the plan did not gain support among all Chartists and the plans never materialised.|$|E
5|$|But the WFM's {{success at}} Cripple Creek {{also created a}} {{significant}} backlash. The WFM was forever tarred as a dangerous and violent organization {{in the eyes of}} employers. Never again would the WFM have in a local strike the level of public support it enjoyed at Cripple Creek in 1894. Indeed, when the union struck the Cripple Creek mines again in 1898, its public support ended after violence broke out. During another strike in 1903–4, whose violent significance earned it the name Colorado Labor Wars, the union went up against the power of <b>the</b> <b>employers</b> and the state combined.|$|E
5|$|Historians hold differing {{views as}} to whether the mounted police were neutral in these {{disputes}} or sided with <b>the</b> <b>employers,</b> although all agree that the position of the police in managing the strikes became more difficult as organised labour became better established. The mounted police disliked labour agitators and strikers with eastern or southern European backgrounds, but they also had some sympathy for the difficulties faced by ordinary workers, and were often unwilling to actively assist the company owners if there was a risk it might cause disturbances to break out.|$|E

In a decision issued in 2015, Judge Vanaskie, writing for the Court, reiterated Judge McNulty's finding that Heffernan's actions in picking up the sign for his mother did not constitute protected speech or association. He distinguished the case at hand from the Sixth Circuit's ruling in Dye by noting that in that case, <b>the</b> <b>employers</b> had inferred the employees' intent from their non-participation in partisan politics rather than an actual action they had taken, as had occurred in Heffernan's case.|$|E

5|$|While in government, Disraeli {{presided over}} a series of social reforms which {{supported}} his one-nation politics and aimed to create a benevolent hierarchy. He appointed a Royal Commission to assess the state of law between employers and employees, the result of which prompted Richard Cross to pass <b>the</b> <b>Employers</b> and Workmen Act of 1875. This act made both sides of industry equal before {{the law and the}} breach of contract a civil offence, rather than criminal. Cross also passed the Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act in the same year which enshrined the right to strike of workers by ensuring that acts carried out by a workers' group could not be indicted as conspiracy.|$|E
50|$|If the {{decision}} to terminate was the employees, the willingness of <b>the</b> <b>employer</b> to rehire is often contingent upon the relationship the employee had with <b>the</b> <b>employer,</b> <b>the</b> amount of notice given by the employee prior to departure, {{and the needs of}} <b>the</b> <b>employer.</b> In some cases, when an employee departed on good terms, s/he may be given special priority by <b>the</b> <b>employer</b> when seeking rehire.|$|R

5|$|As the Great War progressed, war {{exhaustion}} in Germany grew. The first {{strikes in}} the country {{since the start of}} the war broke out in 1915, steadily increasing in frequency and magnitude. The unions' role as troubleshooter between <b>the</b> <b>employers</b> and the workers soon led to conflict between the membership and union officials, and the Free Trade Unions steadily lost members. Correspondingly, the Reichstag faction of the SPD split over continued support for the war. The 1917 February Revolution in Russia was seen by the FVdG as an expression of the people's desire for peace. The syndicalists paid special attention to the role the general strike (which they had been advocating for years) played in the revolution. They were unable to comment on the October Revolution as the Rundschreiben had been banned by the time it broke out.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{evidence}} of industrial unrest targeted at Churchill's activities until the 1970s, there was concern about the possibility during the inter-war years, and the probability of none occurring at all is unlikely. The Economic League was established as a right-wing organisation, consisting mainly of employers, to counteract the rise in communist and socialist propaganda and its associated activities during the Great War. Support for the League was particularly strong among the engineering companies in the Manchester area. While workers in the cotton industries, for example, seemed not generally to take a great interest in the Communist Party, left-wing educational groups and shop-floor agitators, those in the engineering industry—perhaps mostly more intelligent—did do so, and the apparent threat to capitalism and private wealth was more evident to <b>the</b> <b>employers</b> of such people. Among the League's less publicised, more nefarious activities was that of intelligence gathering and the promotion of systematic blacklisting methods. It co-operated with the police and government, infiltrated left-wing groups and used information from disaffected ex-supporters of such groups in order to obtain information about what it considered to be dangerous elements and tendencies, and disseminated the knowledge obtained, usually in a confidential manner. The Churchill Machine Tool Co was one of several companies which during 1936–37 was a recipient of information concerning reports of meetings held by anti-capitalist groups, the past and current activities of particular workers and even the names of those specifically blacklisted. Others who received the information at this time included A V Roe, Ferranti, Metropolitan-Vickers and Fairey Aviation.|$|E
5|$|Child labour in the industries, {{especially}} in match making factories, {{was at its}} peak during the 1970s and 1980s. In 1981, the child work force in the age group 4–16 was 30% of the total work force, 90% of whom were girls. In 1986, the National Child Labour project estimated child labour in Sivaksi match making industries to be 14,121 children. The estimates indicated 80% of the child labour belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC), who were margianlised for centuries for cheap labour. Poverty and lack of farm produce were stated as {{the main reason for}} child labour. <b>The</b> <b>employers</b> also preferred children because of ease in management, discipline and lack of labour unions. The children in these industries suffered from back ache, neck ache, tuberclosis, malnutrition, gastointestinal disorders, dermatitis, respiratory disorders, over-exhaustion, burn injuries and water borne diseases due to exposure to harmful chemicals in the work environment. The situation of the child labour came to light during an accident of a bus transporting the children in 1976. The central government appointed a one-man committee under Harbans Singh in 1978, who reported abolishing child labour would seriously impact the economy of the region. The National Policy on child labour was formulated by the central government in August 1987, aiming at the rehabilitation of children withdrawn from these factories. In 1988, the union labour ministry initiated a programme for providing informal education, free health care and free lunch for children working in the factories. The Supreme Court of India, in a judgement ruled on December 1996 indicating provisions for preventing child labour like compensation for the child employed, employment to the adult members of the family and contribution to the corpus fund by the state government. From the establishment of child labour Act in 1986 till 2011, 150,000 inspections on child labour have been conducted in the factories, 1,500 cases have been registered and few prosecutions have been made. The results indicated small amount of child labour in cottage and house hold industries.|$|E

5|$|Liberty Property Trust {{hoped to}} get the One Pennsylvania Plaza site {{designated}} a Keystone Opportunity Improvement Zone (KOZ). KOZ designation was intended to encourage development in poor, blighted areas by exempting the tenants of the building from all state and local taxes. Designating One Pennsylvania Plaza a KOZ was supported by then Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, who said {{it was important to}} keep corporations within the city. At the time, many of Philadelphia's big employers' leases, including Comcast's, were due to expire, and <b>the</b> <b>employers</b> were considering the possibility of moving out of the city and state. Rendell also said allowing Comcast to enlarge its headquarters by moving into One Pennsylvania Plaza could attract other corporate headquarters to the city. However, other Center City building owners, including Comcast's landlord at Centre Square, HRPT Properties Trust, were opposed to the plan. They said giving the tower the KOZ designation would give it an unfair advantage because Liberty Property Trust could charge above-market rents since the tax breaks would offset the cost for tenants. The group believed tenants attracted to One Pennsylvania Plaza because of the tax breaks would cause more vacancies in other Center City skyscrapers, rather than attracting more business to blighted areas as intended under the law. In early 2004, Center City had a vacancy rate of 12.8%.|$|E
