The party split up into several groups, each independently making its way back to Germany. Niedermayer headed west, attempting to run the Anglo-Russian Cordon and escape through Persia, while von Hentig made for the route over the Pamir Mountains towards Chinese Central Asia. Having served in Peking before the war, von Hentig was familiar with the region and planned to make Yarkand a base from which to make a last attempt to create local Muslim unrest against Anglo-Russian interests in the region. He later escaped over the Hindu Kush, avoiding his pursuers for 130 days {{as he made his way}} on foot and horseback through Chinese Turkestan, over the Gobi Desert, and through China and Shanghai. From there, he stowed away on an American vessel to Honolulu. Following the American declaration of war, he was exchanged as a diplomat. Travelling via San Francisco, Halifax, and Bergen, he finally reached Berlin on 9 June 1917. Meanwhile, Niedermayer escaped towards Persia through Russian Turkestan. Robbed and left for dead, a wounded Niedermayer was at times reduced to begging before he finally reached friendly lines, arriving in Tehran on 20 July 1916. Wagner left Herat on 25 October 1917, making his way through northern Persia to reach Turkey on 30 January 1918. At Chorasan, he tried to rally Persian democratic and nationalist leaders, who promised to raise an army of 12,000 if Germany provided military assistance.|$|E

25|$|Oiceoptoma noveboracense is a diurnal species, {{meaning that}} it is {{primarily}} active during the daytime. This beetle produces one generation per year.

The eggs are laid in the carrion so <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>they</b> become larva they will begin to feed on their substrate. As is common with most Silphidae, the adults will typically feed on carrion as well as the larva of flies that are also feeding on the carrion.|$|E

Philmont's strategic location along the trail spurred some interest in it. In 1841, Carlos Beaubien and Guadalupe Miranda obtained a large land grant from the Mexican government, including the present ranch. Soon the grant fell {{into the hands of}} Beaubien's son-in-law Lucien Maxwell, who {{played an important role in}} developing and settling it.

Associate Deputy Administrator Jason Burnett e-mailed the draft to the White House. White House aides—who had long resisted mandatory regulations {{as a way to}} address climate change—knew the gist of what Johnson's finding would be, Burnett said. They also knew <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>they</b> opened the attachment, it would become a public record, making it controversial and difficult to rescind.

Johnson rescinded the draft; in July 2008, he issued a new version which did not state that global warming was danger to public welfare. Burnett resigned in protest.|$|E
25|$|Internal {{beta testing}} of the game within Blizzard began in 2012. A closed beta was {{launched}} in August 2013, while the game was put into open beta in January 2014. These beta testing periods were {{used to evaluate the}} game's balance, adjusting cards they found to be too powerful or too weak, and making sure no single Hero or deck type dominated the game. As they approached the game's release in March 2014, Blizzard found that it was hard to generate interest in getting people to try the game, believing <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>they</b> tried it they would be drawn into the game; those they asked to try the game felt that Hearthstone wasn't the type of game they would be interested in playing. At this point, Blizzard opted to make Hearthstone free to play supported by microtransactions for less patient players. This helped to significantly boost the game's popularity on release.|$|E
25|$|Back at Han's {{funeral in}} Los Angeles, Dom notices a car observing them, {{and after a}} chase, confronts its driver, who is {{revealed}} to be Shaw. Both prepare to fight, but Shaw flees when a covert ops team arrives and opens fire, led by Frank Petty, a man who calls himself Mr. Nobody. Petty says that he will assist Dom in stopping Shaw if he helps him obtain God's Eye, a computer program that uses digital devices to track down a person, and save its creator, a hacker named Ramsey, from a mercenary named Mose Jakande. Dom, Brian, Letty, Roman Pearce, and Tej Parker then airdrop their cars over the Caucasus Mountains in Azerbaijan, ambush Jakande's convoy, and rescue Ramsey. The team then heads to Abu Dhabi, where a billionaire has acquired the flash drive containing God's Eye, and manages to steal it from the owner. With God's Eye near telecommunications repeaters, the team tracks down Shaw, who is waiting at a remote factory. Dom, Brian, Petty and his team attempt to capture Shaw, but are ambushed by Jakande and his men and forced to flee while Jakande obtains God's Eye. At his own request, the injured Petty is then left behind to be evacuated by helicopter while Brian and Dom continue without him. To reduce their disadvantage, the crew returns to Los Angeles to fight Shaw, Jakande and his men. Meanwhile, Brian promises Mia <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>they</b> deal with Shaw, he will retire and fully dedicate himself to their family.|$|E

500|$|After Nettles' death, Applewhite also altered {{his view}} of ascension: previously, he had taught that the group would {{physically}} ascend from the Earth and that death caused reincarnation, but her death—which left behind an unchanged, corporeal body—forced him {{to say that the}} ascension could be spiritual. He then concluded that her spirit had traveled to a spaceship and received a new body and that he and his followers would do the same. In his view, the Biblical heaven was actually a planet on which highly evolved beings dwelt, and physical bodies were required to ascend there. Applewhite believed <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>they</b> reached the Next Level, they would facilitate evolution on other planets. He emphasized that Jesus, whom he believed was an extraterrestrial, came to Earth, was killed, and bodily rose from the dead before being transported onto a spaceship. According to Applewhite's doctrine, Jesus was a gateway to heaven but had found humanity unready to ascend when he first came to the Earth. Applewhite then decided that there was an opportunity for humans to reach the Next Level [...] "every two millennia", and the early 1990s would therefore provide the first opportunity to reach the Kingdom of Heaven since the time of Jesus. Zeller notes that his beliefs were based on the Christian Bible but were interpreted through the lens of belief in alien contact with humanity.|$|E

2500|$|French Prime Minister and {{chairman}} of the Paris Peace Conference Georges Clemenceau commented that the Klaipėda Region was not attached to Lithuania because it had not yet received de jure recognition. The Lithuanians seized this statement and further campaigned for their rights in the region believing <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>they</b> received international recognition, the region should be theirs. As the mediation of the Polish–Lithuanian conflict over the Vilnius Region by the League of Nations was going nowhere, the Klaipėda Region became a major bargaining chip. Already in 1921, implicit [...] "Klaipėda-for-Vilnius" [...] offers were made. In March 1922, the British made a concrete and explicit offer: in exchange for recognition of Polish claims to Vilnius, Lithuania would receive de jure recognition, Klaipėda Region, and economic aid. The Lithuanians rejected the proposal as they were not ready to give up on Vilnius. After the rejection, the French and British attitudes turned against Lithuania and they now favored the free city solution (Freistaat like the Free City of Danzig). Thus the Lithuanians could wait for an unfavorable decision or they could seize the region and present a fait accompli.|$|E
