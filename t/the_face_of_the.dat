5|$|The courts {{recognise}} {{two forms}} of secret trust. Fully secret trusts are trusts not referred to at all on <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> will. Instead, an agreement made between the testator and trustees elsewhere. The trustee will instead be named only a beneficiary. In {{the case of a}} half-secret trust, the fact that the beneficiary holds as trustee only is declared on <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> will, but not the other terms of the trust.|$|E
5|$|A transit of Venus {{across the}} Sun takes place when the planet Venus passes {{directly}} between the Sun and a superior planet, becoming visible against (and hence obscuring {{a small portion}} of) the solar disk. During a transit, Venus {{can be seen from}} Earth as a small black disk moving across <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun. The duration of such transits is usually several hours (the transit of 2012 lasted 6 hours and 40 minutes). A transit is similar to a solar eclipse by the Moon. While the diameter of Venus is more than 3 times that of the Moon, Venus appears smaller, and travels more slowly across <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun, because it is much farther away from Earth.|$|E
