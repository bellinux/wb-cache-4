50|$|The {{first part}} of Herschel's career was devoted to bridge design, {{including}} the design of cast-iron bridges. For a time, he was employed on the sewerage system of Boston. Herschel was influenced by James B. Francis, who was the agent and engineer of the Proprietors of Locks and Canals on the Merrimack River at Lowell, Massachusetts, to switch his career path to hydraulic engineering. About 1880, he started working for the Holyoke Water Power Company in Massachusetts. He remained with the company until 1889. While he was there, Herschel designed the Holyoke <b>testing</b> <b>flume,</b> which has been said to {{mark the beginning of}} the scientific design of water-power wheels. Herschel first tested his Venturi meter concept in 1886 while working for the company. The original purpose of the Venturi meter was to measure the amount of water used by the individual water mills in the Holyoke area.Water supply development in northern New Jersey was an active area of investment in the late 19th century. In 1889, Herschel was hired as the manager and superintendent of the East Jersey Water Company, where he worked until 1900. He was responsible {{for the development of the}} Pequannock River water supply for Newark. He also installed two of his largest Venturi meters at Little Falls, New Jersey, on the main stem of the Rockaway River to serve Paterson, Clifton and Jersey City.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{assessment}} of the failure mechanism of a shallow landslide triggered by rainfall in a slope of unsaturated volcanic ashes, located at Cervinara, Italy. The region of Campania (Southern of Italy) had suffered in several occasions the consequences of this type of landslides. They have caused casualties, especially in the municipality of Cervinara. Additionally the quick growing of population in this region leads that to an increasing number of people exposed to a considerable risk. For this reason, in the last years, research efforts have been made to define effective alarm system. But, in order to define adequately an alarm system is necessary that the failure mechanism of this landslides be completely understood. This is why, in 2009 an instrumentation system was installed in a slope close to Cervinara to register the evolution of liquid pressure and water content within the slope. This monitoring system is still functional. Additionally a new test was developed in order to obtain information about the rainfall induced failure process. This test consists in a highly instrumented mock-up subjected to a specific rainfall intensity until failure One of the sessions of the last Italian Workshop of landslides (October 2013) was dedicated to the hydrological modelling of landslides, through a benchmark exercise named Round Robin test. This exercise was focus in three analysis scales: laboratory <b>test,</b> mock-up <b>test</b> (<b>flume</b> <b>test)</b> and real case. The benchmark considered two principal stages: back-analysis and prediction.

40|$|The bridge scour depths in {{cohesive}} soil have been predicted using the scour equations developed for cohesionless soils due to scarce of studies about {{cohesive soil}}. The scour depths {{predicted by the}} conventional methods will result in significant errors. For the cost effective design of bridge scour in cohesive soil, the Scour Rate In COhesvie Soil (SRICOS) for the singular circular pier in deep water condition was released in 1999, and has been developed for complex pier and contraction scour. The present study {{is the part of}} SRICOS-EFA method to predict the history of contraction scour, and local scours, such as abutment scour and pier scour. The main objective is to develop the prediction methods for the maximum and the uniform contraction scour depth, the maximum pier scour depth and the maximum abutment using <b>flume</b> <b>test</b> results. The equations are basically composed with the difference between the local Froude number and the critical Froude number. Because the scour happens when the shear stress is bigger than the critical shear stress, which is the maximum shear stress the channel bed material can resist from the erosion, and continues until the shear stress becomes equal to the critical shear stress. All results obtained from <b>flume</b> <b>tests</b> for pier scour have been conducted in Texas A&M University from 1997 to 2002 are collected and reanalyzed in this study. Since the original pier scour equation did not include soil properties. The effect of water depth effect, pier spacing, pier shape and flow attack angle for the rectangular pier are studied and correction factors with respect to the circular pier in deep water condition were newly developed in present study. For the abutment scour, a series of <b>flume</b> <b>tests</b> in large scale was performed in the present study. Two types of channel - rectangular channel, and compound channel - were used. The effect of abutment length, shape and alignment of abutment were studied and the correction factors were developed.

The methodologies to predict the maximum contraction scour and the uniform contraction scour in the compound channel was developed.

The behaviour of local fine soil reinforced with geosynthetics under hydraulic actions was studied using <b>flume</b> <b>tests.</b> The case study was a typical cross section of the walls of the salt pans of the Aveiro lagoon. A preliminary design of a structure was done, for different reinforcements (geogrid, geocomposite, association of geogrid and geotextile). Local soil was collected and characterised using laboratory <b>tests.</b> The <b>flume</b> <b>tests</b> included performing permeability, erosion and overtopping tests, for actions typical of the lagoon environment. The models reinforced with geogrid GGR exhibited the highest global permeability, due to the difficulty of soil lumps to penetrate the geogrid openings.

The other reinforcements (sheets) enabled containing the soil. Non-uniformity of the soil compaction caused local differences of permeability. Thus, ensuring uniform compaction on site is necessary; however it can be challenging, particularly for fine soils. The results indicate that seepage is likely to induce some clogging of the reinforcements. The reinforced soil models tested exhibited higher permeability and lower resistance to erosion and overtopping than the traditional solution (soil matrix with vegetation). The results indicate that a possible alternative solution for the walls could use fibre reinforcement.

40|$|The scour {{development}} {{in time and}} the equilibrium stage of scour near abutments and guide banks with a uniform layer and stratified bed conditions have been studied. At present, no methods are available for computing the depth of a local scour near the bridge crossing structures under complex geological conditions. The <b>tests</b> in <b>flume</b> were made with uniform layers and with two layers with different grain size. The sequence of layers can increase the scour depth and lead to damage or failure of bridge structures. A new method for computing the equilibrium scour depth at elliptical guide banks in the stratified river bed conditions is presented. The method is confirmed by test results...|$|R
