The specialist salvage vessel Salvage Chief removed 90 tonnes (98%) of fuel from the Cita before she sank, leaving only a minor oil slick. Oiled sand on Porth Hellick beach, part of the Isles of Scilly SSSI, was removed by excavation. Three tugs were summoned to collect the containers drifting around the Celtic Sea.|$|E

500|$|On December 6, 2004, it was {{reported}} that Clark had been hospitalized after suffering from a minor stroke. Despite Clark indicating his participation in New Year's Rockin' Eve 2005 in a prepared statement, reports soon surfaced that the stroke may have been serious enough to prevent him from hosting at all. It was officially announced on December 14 that Dick Clark would not be hosting, and that Regis Philbin would fill in for Clark. In a statement, Clark said that he was <b>thankful</b> <b>that</b> Philbin was able to quickly step in on short notice to host the show, and hoped that he would do a good job. Philbin was optimistic about his role, considering it the [...] "best temp job ever." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Beat It 2008" [...] {{received}} generally unfavorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone {{claimed that the}} song was a [...] "contender for the year's most pointless musical moment". AllMusic criticized Fergie for [...] "parroting the lyrics of [...] "Beat It" [...] back to a recorded Jackson". Blenders Kelefa Sanneh {{also noted that the}} Black Eyed Peas singer traded lines with Jackson. [...] "Why?", she queried. Todd Gilchrist was <b>thankful</b> <b>that</b> the remix retained Eddie Van Halen's [...] "incendiary guitar solo", but added that the song [...] "holds the dubious honor of making Jackson seem masculine for once, and only in the context of Fergie's tough-by-way-of-Kids Incorporated interpretation of the tune". Tom Ewing of Pitchfork observed that Fergie's [...] "nervous reverence is a waste of time".|$|E
500|$|Lon Grahnke {{from the}} Chicago Sun-Times gave the episode three stars.

While The Sun-Herald's Rachel Browne awarded the episode four out of five stars and called it an [...] "hilarious homage to The Full Monty". Browne was <b>thankful</b> <b>that</b> the gang's modesty was protected. James Joyce, writing for The Newcastle Herald, commented that the episode was [...] "a crack-up."

I {{have no doubt that}} those who had to do with its management meant well and tried to do the best they could under the circumstances." [...] Another survivor, Francis Webster, was quoted as having said, [...] "Was I sorry that I chose to come by hand cart? No. Neither then nor any minute of my life since. The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay and I am <b>thankful</b> <b>that</b> I was privileged to come in the Martin Hand Cart Company." [...] On the other hand, survivor John Chislett, who later left the Church, wrote bitterly of Richards promising them that [...] "we should get to Zion in safety." ...|$|E
500|$|Cheryl is {{introduced}} as an emotionally fragile woman, who pines for the affection of Archer. As the series began to progress, the character abandons her depressive characteristics and adopts a more maniacal and unstable personality. [...] "It was really {{fun to see}} her evolve," [...] Greer asserted, [...] "and I think [...] and I always had fun recording together. I'm so <b>thankful</b> <b>that</b> it got so crazy and turned so upside down, and how nuts this character is. It's so fun." [...] Her instability has regularly resulted in Cheryl being sent into mental institutions. She is often sexually aroused from being choked. Commentators have described Cheryl as [...] "", [...] "insane", [...] "glue-chugging", and [...] "empty-headed". Throughout much of the first season, the character frequently developed aliases for herself to acquiesce to her coworkers; these aliases include Cristal, an homage to the alcoholic beverage of the same name, and Cariña, which she professed [...] "better captured [...] sensual womanhood".|$|E
500|$|Danny Hale at Flickering Myth said [...] "Lockup" [...] is [...] "a really, {{really fun}} episode", and was <b>thankful</b> <b>that</b> Johnson rejoining S.H.I.E.L.D. was not [...] "resolved without the {{appropriate}} time for the audience to feel her absence". Hale also noted {{the introduction of the}} Darkhold, Coulson and May's interactions, and the added mystery to Mace's character as all things that make [...] "for good viewing and has me hooked for next week." [...] Vulture's Scott Meslow scored the episode three stars out of 5, feeling the season was lacking a [...] "truly compelling villain" [...] and saying the ghost effects look [...] "absolutely terrible". Meslow said the prison scenes had [...] "quippy dialogue" [...] and [...] "solid action scenes", but was more interested in the Mace/Simmons storyline. For Nerdist, Joseph McCabe said, [...] "When S.H.I.E.L.D. is at its best, it doesn’t offer viewers much to dissect. Because it’s all about its momentum, [...] is a textbook example: forty-two minutes of adrenaline without a single wasted moment." [...] He felt the episode had several satisfying character-based moments, especially the scenes between Coulson and May, and though McCabe felt Woods was not the most [...] "adept at staging fight sequences", he still praised the choreography of Johnson's action scenes.|$|E

500|$|Destructoids Chris Carter commended Ashly Burch and Lance Reddick {{for their}} performances, with the {{character}} of Aloy receiving credit for maintaining a [...] "captivating" [...] and [...] "interesting" [...] consistency in the narrative and action sequences. Carter also lauded the focus on exploration and discovery, which he said grew more effective as he traversed more of the land. The game world itself was subject to compliment for its [...] "beautiful" [...] day-night cycle and weather system. According to Carter, the challenging nature of the machines and varied methods with which to battle them brought {{a real sense of}} fun to the combat. Matt Buchholtz of Electronic Gaming Monthly likewise praised Burch as well as the game world, which he found to be mesmerising. Thought as the most powerful part of the game, the Focus feature gained approval for complementing the combat in a way that [...] "forces you to become a hunter". Writing for Game Informer, Jeff Marchiafava opined that, unlike with other open world video games, searching for audio logs and emails provided the plot with a [...] "remarkable sense of discovery". He was <b>thankful</b> <b>that</b> story-based missions dominated the overall experience, arguing that they worked to detail the game world and inspired variation in the gameplay.|$|E
500|$|Notes in his diaries {{show that}} he discreetly resented Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești, although, Ion Vianu stresses, such pronouncements appear to have become a staple of Caragiale's private records only long after Bogdan-Pitești had died. Aside from {{claiming}} to expose his patron's alleged financing by the Central Powers before and during World War I, Caragiale discussed Bogdan-Pitești's homosexuality in disparaging terms (calling him [...] "a blusterer of the anti-natural vice"), and even laying out a plan to rob his residence. The violent solution to poverty, Ion Vianu proposes, may have reflected his appreciation for Félicien Champsaur's L'Arriviste, in which the protagonist uses murder to affirm himself socially. Despite Caragiale's relationships with women and his lapses into homophobia, Ion Vianu argues (partly building on similar comments made by literary historian Matei Călinescu) that the writer had a preference for homosociality or even homoeroticism, both in line with his narcissism. Caragiale's diary also dealt with Bogdan-Pitești's wife, the socialite Domnica, depicting her as an immoral woman. A person known by the initials A.K., who was probably the same as Domnica, is referred to in such notes as being in a ménage à trois situation with Bogdan-Pitești and Caragiale. He confessed being <b>thankful</b> <b>that</b> the long record of sums he had borrowed from Bogdan-Pitești beginning 1916 had been destroyed, probably by Domnica, {{at a time when}} his patron was on his deathbed.|$|E
500|$|For Final Fantasy XII, Balthier was {{voiced by}} Gideon Emery in English and Hiroaki Hirata in Japanese. Emery commented that while voicing the {{character}} of Balthier, he developed a [...] "small crush" [...] on Fran, Balthier's partner. He also commented that the biggest challenge of voicing Balthier was having to stay consistent, adding that he spent {{more than four hours}} in a small booth while doing the voice, which could cause him to [...] "drift away from the character" [...] if he goes on for too long. He also described him as being similar to the character. Emery auditioned for Balthier, seeing him after he did this and [...] "instantly {{fell in love with the}} character". He described him as a cross between Han Solo, James Bond, and Jack Sparrow, citing suave yet cocky attitude. He was <b>thankful</b> <b>that</b> he was not aware of Balthier's popularity since his reveal, stating that he would have been [...] "crippled by the fear of not delivering on what the fans expected". He stated that he took no inspiration from anyone else for the role, wanting to ensure that he was unique. Instead, he cited the pictures and animation of the character as his inspiration. Emery cited Jack Fletcher, the voice director, as a great help in voicing the character and setting up the scene for him. To give Final Fantasy XII a Western feel, Balthier's movements were recorded by a Western motion capture actor.|$|E
