50|$|The Confession of Basel {{is one of}} {{the many}} {{statements}} of faith produced by the Reformation. It was put out in 1534 and must be distinguished from the First and Second Helvetic Confessions, its author being Oswald Myconius, who based it on a shorter confession promulgated by Oecolampadius, his predecessor in the church at Basel. Though it was an attempt <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>into</b> <b>line</b> with the reforming party both those who still inclined to the old faith and the Anabaptist section, its publication provoked a good deal of controversy, especially on its statements concerning the Eucharist. The people of Strasbourg even reproached those of Basel with celebrating a Christless supper. Up to the year 1826 the Confession (sometimes also known as the Confession of Mühlhausen from its adoption by that town) was publicly read from the pulpits of Basel on the Wednesday of Passion week in each year. In 1872 a resolution of the great council of the city practically annulled it.|$|E
5000|$|On 24 March 1939, Saracoğlu told Massigli that Britain and France {{should do}} more to oppose German {{influence}} in the Balkans, which was followed on 29 March by an offer of a Franco-Turkish alliance which would go into effect provided the British also joined. In April 1939, the deputy Soviet Foreign Commissar Vladimir Potemkin {{during a visit to}} Turkey told Massigli that the aim of Soviet foreign policy was <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>into</b> <b>line</b> a [...] "peace front" [...] to oppose German expansionism comprising Britain, France, the Soviet Union and Turkey. In 1939, Massigli was heavily preoccupied with competition with the German Ambassador Franz von Papen in an effort to secure Turkish adherence to the Allied side in the event of war breaking out. As part of the effort to increase French influence on the Turkish government, Massigli arranged for the visit of General Maxime Weygand to Turkey in early May 1939, which was made into a state event. During Weygand's visit, the Turkish President İsmet İnönü told the French that he believed that the best way of stopping Germany was an alliance of Turkey, the Soviet Union, France and Britain; that if such an alliance came into being, the Turks would allow Soviet ground and air forces onto their soil; and that he wanted a major programme of French military aid to modernise the Turkish armed forces. Massigli was most disappointed when the British sent a mere brigadier instead of an admiral to offer military aid to the Turks, remarking sorely that [...] "The Turks respect the Royal Navy; they no longer believe in the British Army." [...] In July 1939 Massigli argued that if the British and French were able to offer a stabilisation fund for the Turkish pound, it would undercut German economic influence in Turkey and tie Turkey to the West. Later in July 1939, Massigli was able to play a major part in arranging for French arms shipments to Turkey and later in August to have an Anglo-French stabilisation fund created to help with Turkey's economic problems. The signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact on 23 August 1939 undid much of Massigli's effects as the Turks always believed that it was essential to have the Soviet Union as an ally to counter Germany, and the signing of the German-Soviet pact undercut completely the assumptions behind Turkish security policy. Through Massigli was often hampered by his poor relations with Bonnet, the efforts of the Les Syriens, and the stingily attitude of the French Treasury towards supporting Turkey, the British historian D.C. Watt argued that Massigli was an outstanding able ambassador who did much to successfully advance French interests in Turkey in 1939.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a timely}} book. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), which {{has served as}} a popular symbol of Canadian {{identity}} since the late nineteenth century, is today awash with financial scandals and accusations of corruption, incompetence, and cover-ups. The police force that {{has its roots in the}} creation of the North-West Mounted Police in 1873 is now perceived by many Canadians as just one more example of a modern, bureaucratic organization that has fallen victim to the misuse and abuse of power. Of particular concern is the RCMP 2 ̆ 7 s controversial role in monitoring and detaining suspected threats to national security. In Riding to the Rescue, Steve Hewitt provides a succinct and comprehensive study of how it was that a frontier police force that seemed out of step and perhaps even unnecessary in the 1910 s transformed itself into a central and modern component of the Canadian state. Hewitt 2 ̆ 7 s focus is regional, but the issues he explores had ramifications far beyond Alberta and Saskatchewan. Indeed, the main story told here concerns the creation of Canada 2 ̆ 7 s security state. Presiding over the early stages of this transformation was Commissioner A. B. Perry, and the book provides detailed evidence of Perry 2 ̆ 7 s campaign to ensure the future of the force during, and in the aftermath of, the Great War. Historians of state security in Canada and elsewhere will appreciate Hewitt 2 ̆ 7 s thorough exploration of the transition of the frontier police force into the key player in the national government 2 ̆ 7 s attempt to secure order through the repression of real and suspected radicals. Perry recognized the government 2 ̆ 7 s need for a national security watchdog and saw this as the key to reinventing the force as the frontier era drew to a close. The book explores the RCMP 2 ̆ 7 s attempts to quell unrest and <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>into</b> <b>line</b> groups deemed threatening to the status quo: communists, socialists, ethnic minorities, workers, and the unemployed...|$|E

40|$|For {{the time}} being, public {{management}} reform represents {{the concern of}} most states, no matter their development level, geographical and strategic position, membership to various supranational structures or political and social organisation systems. This process represents the topic of several papers and publications of outstanding international scientists or specialized structures of international organizations, such as OECD. In the EU Member States or acceding states, an argument for public management reform consists also in the need <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>into</b> <b>line</b> with the national and regional administrations and even European administration. In the reform process, the most visible actors are the public authorities and institutions {{as well as the}} academic environment, which at national, regional or European level has structured own levers and mechanisms for debate and action concerning the reform mentioned. In line with the above efforts, it is worth to mention the activity of the European Group for Public Administration (EGPA), the Network of Institutes and Schools of Public Administration in Central and Eastern Europe (NISPAcee), International Institute of Administrative Sciences (IIAS), European Public Law Organization (EPLO), European Institute of Public Administration (EIPA) etc. In this respect, I have oriented my own preoccupations of analysis and research, expressed in theoretical and empirical studies, accepted with interest in prestigious regional, European or Trans-Atlantic scientific events. In the actual context of developing administrative sciences in Romania, I consider that a synthesis of the main themes and outcomes is useful. They benefited of national and international recognition, being accepted at specialised events, being published or quoted. The contents of the current volumes focus on two important fields of research in administrative sciences: fundamental issues and developments of public administration and services, on one hand, and civil service, on the other hand. Within this broad topic, several chapters aim and present relevant, conceptual and empirical issues of the fundamental processes in national and European administration, i. e. decentralisation, setting up and asserting the European Administrative Space or regional cooperation. Romanian experiments and practices for representing the local interests in the governmental decision-making process, partnership and local governance or universal services are in line with the European trends for developing the public services. In fact, Europeanization of national public administrations represents the outcome and the engine of changes in Romanian public management {{in the context of the}} European integration. The first volume concludes with a broad comparative study concerning Romanian and Japanese public management. Result of a â€œForeign Visiting Professorâ€ programme at the National Institute of Multimedia Education, Japan, the study reveals the core values deriving from the culture and social organisation of two peoples with distinct history and development, that unify and separate the national public administration systems. The conclusions of the first volume are formulated in most studies. They are shaping Romanian public administration as a developing system, open and convergent towards the European values characterising the whole European integration process. The second volume focuses on civil servants’ career and training. The Europeanization process, the curricular harmonization of the content and organisation of higher education in the area of administrative sciences are analysed in view of the principles of European Higher Education Area. Basically, the studies describe a new for researching and method evaluating the contents of the Bachelor and Master programmes according to a set of principles, promoted by the European bodies, such as the European Association for Public Administration Accreditation (EAPAA). The studies represent an extension towards the pillars of a European dialogue concerning in-service training and the impact of new technologies in public organisations. Important experiences in management and training of Romanian civil service are approached in the context of promoting meritocratic criteria or developing the democratic mechanism, supporting the Romanian public management reform. Of course, only reading these lines, a concrete and detailed idea about the current paper could not be formulated. For those interested, it will be a major effort to cover all the topics presented. Every topic is subject to appreciations and critics, representing the pillar of new developments. In fact, it represents one of the aims for my approach. The other aims are focused on re-launching the professional and scientific dialogue in specialised academia on the coordinates of research in the field of public management, accepted at European level, ensuring an enhanced internal, national and European visibility for the contributions of the Romanian public management school.
