If contamination is present, it is often confined within the surface layers of the metal. The UKAEA Winfrith site operates a shot-blast facility (WACM) that removes paint and surface contamination from low carbon steel enabling surface contaminated painted metal to be processed and therefore certified as exempt. A study was conducted to determine whether tritium (as <b>tritiated</b> <b>water</b> <b>vapour)</b> has penetrated into the metal to levels exceeding the Radioactive Substances Act (1993), Substances of Low Activity (SoLA) Exemption Order criteria, and whether processing via the WACM removes sufficient tritium contamination that the SoLA Exemption Order criteria can be met. The results of sampling and analysis show that the tritium is mainly held in the paint or outer 40 µm layer of the metal and that processing through the WACM removes these layers along with sufficient tritium to meet the SoLA Exemption Order criteria...|$|E
40|$|The {{computer}} program NORMTRI {{has been developed}} to calculate the behaviour of tritium in the environment released into the atmosphere under normal operation of nuclear facilities. It is possible to investigate the two chemical forms tritium gas and <b>tritiated</b> <b>water</b> <b>vapour.</b> The conversion of tritium gas into tritiated water followed by its reemission back to the atmosphere {{as well as the}} conversion into organically bound tritium is considered. NORMTRI is based on the statistical Gaussian dispersion model ISOLA, which calculates the activity concentration in air near the ground contamination due to dry and wet deposition at specified locations in a polar grid system. ISOLA requires a four-parametric meteorological statistics derived from one or more years synoptic recordings of 1 -hour-averages of wind speed, wind direction, stability class and precipitation intensity. Additional features of NORMTRI are the possibility to choose several dose calculation procedures, ranging from the equations of the German regulatory guidelines to a pure specific equilibrium approach.

40|$|A radon-based nocturnal {{stability}} {{classification scheme}} is developed for a flat inland site near Bucharest, Romania, characterised by significant local surface roughness heterogeneity, and compared with traditional meteorologically-based techniques. Eight months of hourly meteorological and atmospheric radon observations from a 60 m tower at the IFIN-HH nuclear research facility are analysed. Heterogeneous surface roughness {{conditions in the}} 1 km radius exclusion zone around the site hinder accurate characterisation of nocturnal atmospheric mixing conditions using conventional meteorological techniques, so a radon-based scheme is trialled. When the nocturnal boundary layer is very stable, the Pasquill–Gifford “radiation” scheme overestimates the atmosphere's capacity to dilute pollutants with near-surface sources (such as <b>tritiated</b> <b>water</b> <b>vapour)</b> by 20 % compared to the radon-based scheme. Under these conditions, near-surface wind speeds drop well below 1 m s− 1 and nocturnal mixing depths vary from ∼ 25 m to less than 10 m above ground level (a. g. l.). Combining nocturnal radon with daytime ceilometer data, {{we were able to}} reconstruct the full diurnal cycle of mixing depths. Average daytime mixing depths at this flat inland site range from 1200 to 1800 m a. g. l. in summer, and 500 – 900 m a. g. l. in winter. Using tower observations to constrain the nocturnal radon-derived effective mixing depth, we were able to estimate the seasonal range in the Bucharest regional radon flux as: 12 mBq m− 2 s− 1 in winter to 14 mBq m− 2 s− 1 in summer. © 2016, Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

It enters the body mainly as <b>tritiated</b> <b>water</b> through inhalation, with food, drinks and through the skin; part of tritium gradually transforms into the metabolised organically bound tritium as a result of biochemical reactions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate organically bound tritium contribution to the effective dose of an adult using the biokinetic model and real dosimetric data. The data of long term monitoring from 6 studies with 17 workers or volunteers following single intake of <b>tritiated</b> <b>water</b> in the body were selected from 9 publications (1968 - 1997). Three two-compartment models of tritium biokinetics were used in this study: recurrent model with gradual transformation of tritium from <b>tritiated</b> <b>water</b> into organically bound tritium and <b>tritiated</b> <b>water</b> excretion; model with instant transformation of tritium into organically bound tritium and <b>tritiated</b> <b>water</b> excretion; model with instant transformation of tritium into organically bound tritium and both <b>tritiated</b> <b>water</b> and organically bound tritium excretion (according to ICRP). The ICRP model doesn’t properly reflect the real <b>tritiated</b> <b>water</b> metabolism in the human body: second exponent of the <b>tritiated</b> <b>water</b> content in the body water and accumulation of the organically bound tritium fraction are absent. The organically bound tritium fraction composes 3 % of <b>tritiated</b> <b>water</b> in ICRP model. It is significantly higher compared to two other models (0, 4 % and 0, 8 %). According to the first model the contribution of OBT fraction to the mean dose varied from 1, 8 to 4, 6 % for individuals; mean value was 3, 0 ± 0, 9 %. According to the second model the contribution of organically bound tritium fraction was slightly higher: 3, 6 ± 1, 1 %, according to the ICRP model – 9 %. The dynamic of excretion of tritium with urine can be described with double-exponential curves and provides the basis for two-compartment modeling. The recurrent model with <b>tritiated</b> <b>water</b> excretion was more adjusted to human physiology.

40|$|Ionization {{chambers}} {{are widely}} used for measuring tritium in the gas phase. Recently, however, it has been perceived that the contamination of the chamber wall due to the adsorption of tritium significantly impairs {{the reliability of the}} ionization chambers when they are used for measuring tritium at high concentrations. As a first step to overcome this difficulty, we studied the contamination of ionization chambers with tritium gas (HT) and/or <b>tritiated</b> <b>water</b> vapor (HTO) by using different component materials (Cu, Ni-plated, and Au-plated chambers). In case of the Cu chamber, the concentration of tritium gas in the chamber decreased exponentially with time due to purge by fresh air to a certain level. Then, the decrease rate slowed down drastically (the memory effect). This is caused by adsorption of <b>tritiated</b> <b>water</b> {{on the surface of the}} material; the <b>tritiated</b> <b>water</b> being formed in the chamber due to exchange reaction with water vapor. In case of the Ni-plated chamber, the memory effect was also observed; however, this is not due to the adsorbed <b>tritiated</b> <b>water.</b> Instead, it is thought to due to adsorbed tritium such as T(a) or HT(a). With respect to the Au-plated chamber, no memory effect took place when it was exposed to tritium gas (HT). On the other hand, when the chambers were exposed to <b>tritiated</b> <b>water</b> vapor, all showed a large memory effect. It was clarified that the memory effect principally arose from the physically adsorbed <b>tritiated</b> <b>water.</b> In conclusion, the Au-plated chamber is most preferable for measuring tritium gas. However, the memory effect due to the adsorption of <b>tritiated</b> <b>water</b> vapor is as large as that for the other two. Therefore, it is necessary to develop suitable decontamination methods for the contamination will have to be avoided by the selection of more suitable materials...|$|R

The obtained data set allows case studies and detailed characterization of stratospheric <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> vertical distribution within different conditions in the Arctic polar stratosphere. <b>Water</b> <b>vapour</b> vertical distribution in the Arctic lower stratosphere is primarily affected by the dynamical effects of polar vortex and by phase aggregation at the temperatures below ice PSC threshold. The measured H 2 O profiles carry the signatures of different processes occurring in the Arctic winter stratosphere and reveal a detailed view on the Arctic UT/LS <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> distribution. The measurements clearly demonstrate typical differences in stratospheric <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> concentration {{inside and outside the}} vortex; for example in the polar vortex of 2003 / 04 at 20 hPa the difference reaches 1. 4 ppmv. Also it is pointed out that <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> profiles obtained at the edge or close to the edge of vortex are characteristic by their laminated structure. As shown by the results of RDF-analysis this structure is not linked to dehydration but to differential advection of air masses originating from inside and outside the vortex. Thus <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> is proved to be a valuable tracer for dynamical processes in the polar stratosphere. In the other case, the <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> vertical profiles obtained at Ny-Alesund in January 2005 during the presence of PSCs clearly show the dehydration layers with reduced <b>water</b> <b>vapour.</b> Another focus is put here on the <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> vertical distribution within the so called transition layer above the polar tropopause. The existence of this transition layer may be caused by diffusion of <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> through the smeared polar winter tropopause, whereas the vertical structure of the H 2 O profile is affected by the dynamical processes. In addition the variability of <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> at the hygropause and the distance between tropopause and hygropause are discussed...|$|R

40|$|We {{present for}} the first time an {{assimilation}} of Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> column data into a Mars global climate model (MGCM). We discuss the seasonal cycle of <b>water</b> <b>vapour,</b> the processes responsible for the observed <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> distribution, and the cross-hemispheric water transport. The assimilation scheme is shown to be robust in producing consistent reanalyses, and the global <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> column error is reduced to around 2 – 4 pr μm depending on season. Wave activity is shown {{to play an important role}} in the <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> distribution, with topographically steered flows around the Hellas and Argyre basins acting to increase transport in these regions in all seasons. At high northern latitudes, zonal wavenumber 1 and 2 stationary waves during northern summer are responsible for spreading the sublimed <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> away from the pole. Transport by the zonal wavenumber 2 waves occurs primarily to the west of Tharsis and Arabia Terra and, combined with the effects of western boundary currents, this leads to peak <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> column abundances here as observed by numerous spacecraft. A net transport of water to the northern hemisphere over the course of one Mars year is calculated, primarily because of the large northwards flux of <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> which occurs during the local dust storm around L s = 240 - 260 °. Finally, outlying frost deposits that surround the north polar cap are shown to be important in creating the peak <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> column abundances observed during northern summer...|$|R
