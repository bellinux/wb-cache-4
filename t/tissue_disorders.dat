5|$|A {{spontaneous}} CSF leak is idiopathic, {{meaning the}} cause in unknown. Various scientists and physicians {{have suggested that}} this condition {{may be the result}} of an underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the spinal dura. It may also run in families and be associated with aortic aneurysms and joint hypermobility. Up to two thirds of those afflicted demonstrate some type of generalized connective tissue disorder. Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are the three most common connective <b>tissue</b> <b>disorders</b> associated with SCSFLS.|$|E
5|$|The gene TGFBR2 {{has been}} implicated in several {{connective}} <b>tissue</b> <b>disorders</b> including Marfan syndrome, arterial tortuosity, and thoracic aortic aneurysm. A study of patients with SCSFLS demonstrated no mutations in this gene. Minor features of Marfan syndrome {{has been found in}} 20% of CSF leak patients. Abnormal findings of fibrillin-1 has been documented in these CSF-leak patients, but only one patient demonstrated a fibrillin-1 defect consistent with Marfan syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Common {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of DVT include pain or tenderness, swelling, warmth, redness or discoloration, and distention of surface veins, although about half of those with the condition have no symptoms. Signs and symptoms alone are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to make a diagnosis, but when considered in conjunction with known risk factors, can help determine the likelihood of DVT. In most suspected cases, DVT is ruled out after evaluation, and symptoms are more often due to other causes, such as cellulitis, Baker's cyst, musculoskeletal injury, or lymphedema. Other differential diagnoses include hematoma, tumors, venous or arterial aneurysms, and connective <b>tissue</b> <b>disorders.</b>|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{suspected}} causes of tonsillar herniation including: decreased or malformed posterior fossa (the lower, back {{part of the}} skull) not providing enough room for the cerebellum; hydrocephalus or abnormal CSF volume pushing the tonsils out; or dural tension pulling the brain caudally. Connective <b>tissue</b> <b>disorders,</b> such as Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, can be associated.|$|E
25|$|Aortic {{dissection}} {{is associated}} with hypertension (high blood pressure) and many connective <b>tissue</b> <b>disorders.</b> Vasculitis (inflammation of an artery) is rarely associated with aortic dissection. It can also {{be the result of}} chest trauma. About 72 to 80% of individuals who present with an aortic dissection have a previous history of hypertension.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids {{increase}} cholesterol LDL {{production by}} increasing production and activity of HMG-CoA reductase. These include the physiologic stress hormone cortisol and commonly used medicines for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, or connective <b>tissue</b> <b>disorders.</b> Other steroid hormones and drugs are also implicated. In contrast, the thyroid hormone decreases cholesterol production. Hence, hypothyroidism (lack of thyroid hormone) causes hypercholesterolemia.|$|E

Many children with spinal muscular atrophy develop pectus excavatum due to their diaphragmatic breathing. Pectus excavatum also occurs in about 1% of persons diagnosed with celiac disease for unknown reasons.|$|E
25|$|Rheumatologists treat arthritis, {{autoimmune}} diseases, pain disorders affecting joints, and osteoporosis. There {{are more}} than 200 types of these diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout, lupus, back pain, osteoporosis, and tendinitis. Some of these are very serious diseases that {{can be difficult to}} diagnose and treat. They treat soft tissue problems related to musculoskeletal system sports related soft <b>tissue</b> <b>disorders.</b>|$|E
25|$|Xerostomia may {{be caused}} by {{autoimmune}} damage to the salivary glands. Sjögren's syndrome is one such disease, and it causes other symptoms, including xerophthalmia (dry eyes), dry vagina, fatigue, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain). Females are more likely to suffer from autoimmune disease, and 90% of people with Sjögren's syndrome are women. Primary Sjögren's syndrome is the combination of dry eyes and xerostomia. Secondary Sjögren's syndrome is identical to primary form but {{with the addition of a}} combination of other connective <b>tissue</b> <b>disorders</b> such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of bruises {{may be seen}} in patients with platelet or coagulation disorders, or those who are being treated with an anticoagulant. Unexplained bruising may be a warning sign of child abuse, domestic abuse, or serious medical problems such as leukemia or meningoccocal infection. Unexplained bruising can also indicate internal bleeding or certain types of cancer. Long-term glucocorticoid therapy can cause easy bruising. Bruising present around the navel (belly button) with severe abdominal pain suggests acute pancreatitis. Connective <b>tissue</b> <b>disorders</b> such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome may cause relatively easy or spontaneous bruising depending on the severity.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{influence}}s: The {{influence of}} genetic factors is high. AAA is {{four to six}} times more common in male siblings of known patients, with a risk of 20-30%. The high familial prevalence rate is most notable in male individuals. There are many hypotheses about the exact genetic disorder that could cause higher incidence of AAA among male members of the affected families. Some presumed that the influence of alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency could be crucial, while other experimental works favored the hypothesis of X-linked mutation, which would explain the lower incidence in heterozygous females. Other hypotheses of genetic causes have also been formulated. Connective <b>tissue</b> <b>disorders,</b> such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, have also been strongly associated with AAA. Both relapsing polychondritis and pseudoxanthoma elasticum may cause abdominal aortic aneurysm.|$|E
25|$|ANA {{screening}} yields {{positive results}} in many connective <b>tissue</b> <b>disorders</b> and other autoimmune diseases, and may occur in normal individuals. Subtypes of antinuclear antibodies include anti-Smith and anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies (which {{are linked to}} SLE) and anti-histone antibodies (which are linked to drug-induced lupus). Anti-dsDNA antibodies are highly specific for SLE; they are present in 70% of cases, whereas they appear in only 0.5% of people without SLE. The anti-dsDNA antibody titers also tend to reflect disease activity, although not in all cases. Other ANA that may occur in people with SLE are anti-U1 RNP (which also appears in systemic sclerosis and mixed connective tissue disease), SS-A (or anti-Ro) and SS-B (or anti-La; {{both of which are}} more common in Sjögren's syndrome). SS-A and SS-B confer a specific risk for heart conduction block in neonatal lupus.|$|E

2500|$|A {{veterinarian}} or experienced horse owner can palpate {{the back}} of a horse to pinpoint sources of pain and from there assess the most likely cause. [...] Radiographs (X-Rays) can be used to diagnose potential problems with cracked vertebrae, some forms of arthritis, impinging dorsal spinous processes (kissing spines), and other skeletal problems, although with large, heavily muscled animals this diagnostic modality is limited. [...] Certain types of soft tissue injury can be assessed with other modern diagnostic imaging techniques, such as ultrasound.

[...] The immune system makes proteins and antibodies that fight infections in the body to maintain a homeostatic condition. [...] In some disorders the body targets the stomach as if it were a foreign protein or pathogen; it makes antibodies against, severely damages, and may even destroy the stomach or its lining. [...] In some cases bile, normally used to aid digestion in the small intestine, will enter through the pyloric valve of the stomach if it has been removed during surgery or does not work properly, also leading to gastritis. [...] Gastritis may also be caused by other medical conditions, including HIV/AIDS, Crohn's disease, certain connective <b>tissue</b> <b>disorders,</b> and liver or kidney failure. Since 1992, chronic gastritis lesions are classified according to the Sydney system.|$|E
