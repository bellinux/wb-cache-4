5|$|In {{his brief}} retirement, {{he focused on}} his horse racing career, sending <b>Talk</b> <b>is</b> Money to the 2001 Kentucky Derby {{although}} the thoroughbred did not complete the race.

5|$|Other {{similarities}} include {{engaging in}} the suspense the speaker is attempting to create. In both scenarios, you must put aside {{the knowledge that the}} performers know the outcome of the event being relayed and, in a sense, play along. This is integral to his stance as he explains “the argument that much of talk consists of replayings and that these make no sense unless some form of storyteller's suspense can be maintained shows the close relevance of frame-indeed, the close relevance of dramaturgy-for the organization of talk.” Lastly, because the replaying of strips is not extemporaneous, but rather preformulated, it is yet another parallel between a stage production and conversation. All of these things work in concert to provide a foundation of how <b>talk</b> <b>is</b> framed.|$|E
5|$|The Church holds three daily prayer {{meetings}} {{during the}} week, with two meetings on Sundays and one regular consecration.

25|$|Man Talk, Woman <b>Talk</b> <b>is</b> humorous, as quintessential comedies {{from the}} author can be. He makes use of wry humour to seek a level playing ground for {{resolution}} of the biases men and women nurse about one another and which affect mutual co-existence of the two. The scene is a court though devoid of the usual technicalities of court rooms. Instead of legal jargon, there is humour, arguments and counter arguments. What the author arrives at is not to prove which gender is superior but to show the complementary roles of men and women. There {{is a great deal}} of wit in the work and the setting here is the university environment where the youthful contenders are idealistic.|$|E

This causes the audience to be more attentive to the speaker and gain a broader array of knowledge from the presentations given.|$|R
