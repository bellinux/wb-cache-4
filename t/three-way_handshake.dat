30|$|An {{ultra-light weight}} and low power {{complexity}} MAC protocol is suggested {{with the support}} of <b>three-way</b> <b>handshakes</b> between a body coordinator and nodes [64]. The CSMA/CA access scheme can avoid data collision but this scheme creates overheads and increases a higher delay during data transmission due to RTS, CTS, DATA and acknowledgment (ACK). Thus, the suggested protocol [64] replaces the functionalities of CSMA/CA access scheme with ‘Data Request’ (DR), DATA and ACK. The DR maintains the address of each node whereas a node waits for DR message from the body coordinator before data transmission. During data transmission of a node- 1 to the body coordinator, all nodes turn-off their radio signals and change their states to the sleep states. Since, the body coordinator replies back with piggybacking message (ACK + DR 2) to a node- 1 when the body coordinator receives DATA. The [64] tries to change the control signal messages of the CSMA/CA scheme access but each node waits for a DR message before data transmission. Hence, the energy consumption of the suggested scheme is enhanced but the allocation of slots to nodes is based on the contention which reduces data reliability of sensory data in terms of a higher delay which is not acceptable for emergency data.|$|R

30|$|To protect users’ privacy, Tsai et al. [10], Fu et al. [11], and Zhu et al. [12] {{respectively}} presented anonymous handover authentication protocols, which effectively {{protected the}} privacy of users from attackers. However, these protocols need at least <b>three-way</b> <b>handshakes</b> to implement the handover authentication process, which {{is associated with a}} high communication cost and authentication delay. To improve performances, Yang et al. [13] and He et al. [14] proposed anonymous handover authentication protocols, which only involved two-way handshakes. Later, Yang et al. [13] presented an anonymous handover authentication protocol by using group signature technique, where each access point (AP) is the group manager of an independent group signature system, and in the handover authentication process, mobile clients only need to send a group signature generated by an AP (AP 1) to a new AP (AP 2). If the group signature is valid, AP 2 will authenticate the mobile client; otherwise, AP 2 will reject the request. He et al. [14] described an anonymous handover authentication protocol by using pseudo identities. Mobile clients pre-apply pseudo identities (PID 1 …PIDn) from AS. The handover authentication process can be completed only by sending a PID (PIDi). However, both [13, 14] are based on bilinear pairings which have a high computational cost. To achieve a better performance, our previous works [15] and Chaudhry et al. [16] respectively used elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to construct the protocols. However, both [15, 16] incur high computation overhead at the mobile client side and cannot provide batch authentication as well.|$|R

Moreover, people trust such connections and readily use them to transfer sensitive information. With an explosive increase of their use we need expand the aspect of evaluating the security issues wireless networks. Majority of household are using the latest secured protocols the WPA 2 with a government grade standard nowadays. These protocols are still vulnerable to dictionary attacks that are normally carried out by recording <b>three-way</b> <b>handshakes</b> between the wireless router and the connected client. This method is really common and widely used - its success depends {{on the strength of}} the password being used. The research presented here shows another efficient method of hijacking and breaking into home networks is by using a Man-in-the-Middle type attack. The proposed system is implemented on a Raspberry Pi carried by a drone. While until recently UAV's (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) have been used mainly by militaries and some specialist organisations, nowadays they have become widely available, cheaper and user friendly. The use of a drone allows the system to cover a wide area of potential targets as well as relatively quickly move from one target and WiFi network to another. The system is based on war flying using commercially available drones (Wang, 2006). The main goal of this project {{is to be able to}} hijack a wireless connection session between a connected tablet PC and Access Point using WPA 2 encryption. We will be able to automate a Man in the Middle attack just by flying the drone around a certain area, setting up a rogue access point and being able to harvest important credentials from the targeted wireless networks and connected devices. The system is based on a number of open source Wi-Fi penetration testing and configuration tools including iwconfig or airmon-ng and custom scripts. The drone payload (Raspberry Pi B+) is using two wireless dongles; one for monitoring the wireless networks and the other one for being the rogue access point. The Raspberry Pi is powered by a 1000 mAh battery and carried by a DJI Phantom Drone. The device is also capable of other types of attacks.

But it causes more communication overhead in heterogeneous networks. Wei Chen et al. [23] proposes a storage-efficient data structure and a change-point detection method to distinguish complete <b>three-way</b> TCP <b>handshakes</b> from incomplete ones. This mechanism leads to large memory consumption. Sungwon Yi et al. [15] introduced a two-level cache Content Addressable Memory (CAM) to dynamically detect and quarantine the unresponsive TCP flows [18]. But {{it leads to}} large memory comsumption. Dimitris Geneiata et al. [7] proposed a two-part bloom filter based monitor to detect and filter flooding attacks against proxy servers. The monitor's main task is to record the state of any incoming session in 3 different filters and the filter is indexed through a hash function. This mechanism uses an alarming system to trigger an alarm and report if any entries in the filter exceed the threshold value. This mechanism is very efficient and cost-effective and causes reduced time delay to detect an attack. However, hashing of entries in the filters leads to computation overhead and more CPU utilization. Dimitris Geneiatakis et al. [6] proposes a new header to overcome signaling DoS attacks in SIP servers. But the scheme uses a pre-shared key which when explored leads to password-based attacks and also it is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. It is observed in [9] that collaborative flooding attacks (DDoS) depend heavily on IP spoofing; therefore clever IP spoof detection might contribute to solving the problem. A common way for preventing IP spoofing is by using ingress and egress filters on firewalls [19]. But it fails in wireless networks where legitimate packets could have topologically incorrect addresses. In this paper, we have introduced a spoof-based collaborative detection of collaborative flooding attack (DDoS).|$|R

Although in many modern implementations the protocol is efficient, it does add significant overhead compared to simpler protocols.
