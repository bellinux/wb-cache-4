5|$|According to the Kennel Club {{studbook}}, Old Jock was bred at {{some point}} during 1859 either by Captain Percy Williams in his Rufford Kennels, or by Jack Morgan who at the time was a huntsman with the Grove Kennels. He was bred from Jock and Grove Pepper, both huntman's terriers. Jock was owned by Captain Williams, while Grove Pepper was owned by Morgan. It was claimed in W.D. Drury's 1903 work British Dogs, Their Points, Selection, And Show Preparation <b>that</b> <b>Old</b> Jock was in fact bred from Quorn Kennels and that the listing in the Kennel Club studbook was incorrect.|$|E

Wolves are major predators; a study found <b>that</b> <b>old</b> rutting bulls might be vulnerable to wolves. Cheetahs and pariah dogs are the other predators. Juveniles are also hunted by jackals.

These results suggest that simple facilitation of cognitive strategy on younger children is not useful, and that the facilitation of metacognition and elaboration of schema are useful on young children. 幼児よりも年長児の方が,情報を体制化すること,意味的に情報を符号化すること,情報を効率的に検索することについては優れている｡しかし,特徴検出的処理では年齢差が見られないが,特徴分析的処理では幼児よりも年長児が優れること,さらに大人の認知的研究で作られたパラダイムを直接的に使うことには問題があることが,発達研究で報告されている｡また,幼児に認知的方略を訓練しても,その効果がいろんな場面に転移しないことも証明されている｡これらの結果は,幼児が認知的ストラテジーを単純に促進しても,それが後の学習にとって有効でないこと,有効にするためにはメタ認知の促進とスキーマの精微化が必要であることを示唆している...|$|R

As more of the artefact is uncovered additional fossils are found, which Roney dates to five million years, suggesting that the object is at least <b>that</b> <b>old.</b> The interior is empty, and a symbol of five intersecting circles, which Roney identifies as the occult pentacle, is etched on a wall that appears to conceal an inner chamber.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of the morning of November 7, 1825, the very morning the {{legislature}} was to convene, Sharp was assassinated. Charges were made <b>that</b> <b>Old</b> Court supporters had instigated the murder. Crittenden tried to blunt these charges by introducing a resolution condemning Sharp's murder and offering $3,000 for the murderer's capture. When assassin Jereboam O. Beauchamp was apprehended, it became clear that the motivation for the killing was personal, not political. (Beauchamp's wife had married him on the condition that he kill Sharp, who had refused to claim the child he had fathered with her previously.) Despite this, Crittenden refused a request to represent Beauchamp in his murder trial because he wanted to avoid any implication in the matter.|$|E
5|$|More than 600 archeological {{sites have}} been found inside the {{boundaries}} of Petrified Forest National Park. Evidence suggests that the earliest inhabitants of the park arrived at least 8,000 years ago. Two Folsom-type spear points, the earliest artifacts of Paleo-Indians found in the park, are at least <b>that</b> <b>old.</b> Between 6000BCE and 1CE, the Archaic–Early Basketmaker Era, nomadic groups established seasonal camps in the Petrified Forest from which they hunted small game such as rabbits, pronghorn antelope, and deer and harvested seeds from Indian ricegrass and other wild plants. Around 150BCE, they began to grow corn in the area. By 1CE, as their farming techniques improved, some built houses in the Petrified Forest and began to stay there year-round.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to examine age-related declines in the {{processing}} of spatial frequency information. Some current theories of spatial vision state that humans process high spatial frequency information separately or differently from low spatial frequency information. There is also evidence that normal aging may affect the processing of some spatial frequencies more than others. Specifically, it has been proposed <b>that</b> <b>older</b> adults have deficits {{in their ability to}} process low spatial frequency information, and <b>that</b> <b>older</b> adults process visual information more slowly in general than young adults. Eight observers in each of three age groups were tested on a localization task. The spatial frequency content of distractors presented in the visual field was varied along with speed of presentation and clarity of the display. A progressive loss in the extent of the functional visual field was demonstrated. Results were consistent with the position <b>that</b> <b>older</b> adults experience declines in their ability to process temporal information, and <b>that</b> <b>older</b> adults do process visual information at a slower rate than young adults...|$|R
40|$|There are few {{situations}} in which memory performance is bet-ter in older than in younger adults.

One interpretation of these findings is <b>that</b> <b>older</b> adults are less able to inhibit irrelevant information than younger adults are (Hasher & Zacks, 1988; Hasher, Zacks, & May, 1999), so <b>that</b> <b>older</b> adults process more of such information (e. g., Kim, Hasher, & Zacks, 2007; Rowe, Valderrama, Hasher, & Lenartowicz, 2006).
