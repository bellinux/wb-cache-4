If the distance is not considerable, it will usually return to its web within a couple of days. Otherwise, it will start a new one.|$|E

500|$|While {{migration}} to more developed countries {{in search of}} better opportunities, also known as [...] "brain drain," [...] is partially responsible for the shortage of health care workers in Malawi, many health care workers have been personally affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic; in fact, an average of 48 nurses die of HIV/AIDS in Malawi every year. The HIV/AIDS epidemic has resulted in high levels of absenteeism among health workers in Malawi, who often leave work {{to spend time with}} HIV-positive friends or relatives, and the Malawian government has failed to respond to the declining number of full-time employees working in the health sector. Health workers who are not chronically absent frequently abandon their jobs because they are unable to cope with the heavy patient loads or because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> that working in a medical environment will increase their risk of becoming infected with HIV.|$|E

500|$|Lucy Popescu of CineVue {{called the}} film [...] "a {{powerful}} {{indictment of the}} global trade in human beings and the abuse of vulnerable people," [...] but criticized the film for focusing on human trafficking victims, arguing that the perpetrators should have been dealt with more prominently. She commended Bilheimer on the few interviews with traffickers that he did include, but she condemned as inadequate the [...] "only passing reference {{to the thousands of}} men who engage in sexual tourism, like those who travel to Cambodia to 'buy' traumatized children who they can then abuse for weeks at a time." [...] Popescu also called the film [...] "simplistic", arguing that it should have more clearly expressed that sex trafficking victims are not able to provide legitimate consent for sexual activity because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> that their lives might be in danger if they do not comply. John Rash of the Star Tribune called the film [...] "a cacophony of concerned voices speaking about a modern-day scourge." [...] Rash praised the film for its global scope, but suggested that this geographical breadth allows American audiences to ignore the fact that the trafficking of children is prevalent in the United States and not just in other countries.|$|E
500|$|Themes in {{the series}} often revolve around {{forbidden}} love, such as those involving Bluestar and Oakheart, Graystripe and Silverstream, Leafpool and Crowfeather, and Dovewing and Tigerheart. These relationships are not allowed for various reasons: some involve medicine cats (such as Leafpool), who cannot have mates, while others develop between cats in different Clans, which is forbidden by the warrior code. Holmes said that another central theme of the series centres on [...] "faith and spirituality" [...] in StarClan. [...] All books {{in the series}} feature the influence of StarClan, not just as the cats think of them, {{but in terms of}} prophecies delivered by StarClan which inevitably come true. [...] Some scenes take place within StarClan's realm, with no living cats present as point-of-view characters. [...] Thus the existence of an afterlife and the influence of spirits who have passed on and yet retain their earthly identities is integral to all of the plot arcs in the series. Another idea explored in the novels is the reactions of different faiths when meeting each other. For example, the Tribe of Rushing Water, which believes in different spiritual ancestors than the Clans, is introduced in Moonrise. In an author chat, Holmes explained that the books never say that either of the Clans or the Tribe of Rushing Water is right about faith because both are [...] "equally valid." [...] This leads to fear and suspicion between them because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> of things they do not understand. Holmes said that [...] "ignorance is a very scary thing!" [...] Non-belief is also significant in the storylines: Mothwing and Cloudtail do not believe in StarClan.|$|E

Hersh later clarified that he didn't dispute Bin Laden's death in Pakistan, and rather meant that the lying began in the aftermath of bin Laden's death.|$|E

2500|$|Today the BDSM culture {{exists in}} most western countries. This offers BDSM {{practitioners}} {{the opportunity to}} discuss BDSM relevant topics and problems with like-minded people.

Many people hide their leaning from society since <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> of the incomprehension and of social exclusion. It is commonly known in the BDSM culture that there are practitioners living on all continents, but there is no documented evidence for many countries (due to restrictive laws and censorship motivated by politics or religion) except their presence in online BDSM communities and dating sites.|$|E

50|$|Raven {{the trickster}} came upon three young women drying salmon on the beach.

He went through {{a long list of}} animals, all of which the young women said <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not <b>afraid</b> of until he mentioned owls. The women confessed <b>they</b> <b>were</b> very <b>afraid</b> of owls. Raven walked away and hid himself in some bushes nearby, where he began to mimic owl calls. The women were terrified, and ran up the mountainside. When <b>they</b> <b>were</b> halfway up and could run no more, they turned into yellow cedar trees. This is said to be why cedars are beautiful, growing silky bark like a woman's hair, graceful limbs, and why their young trunks are smooth to touch.

Golaud is puzzled when learning that they (Pelléas and Mélisande) never send Yniold away because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> when he is not there and keep on crying in the dark.

2500|$|According to Frederick Hoxie's Encyclopedia of North American Indians, Crazy Horse was {{the third}} in his male line to bear the name of Crazy Horse, which in Lakota is Tȟašúŋke Witkó.

The love of his life was Black Buffalo Woman, whom he courted, but she married another man named No Water. At one point, Crazy Horse persuaded Black Buffalo Woman to run away with him. No Water {{borrowed}} a pistol and ran after his wife. When he found her with Crazy Horse, he fired at him, injuring him in the face and leaving a noticeable scar. Crazy Horse was married two times, first to Black Shawl and second to Nellie Larrabee (Laravie). Nellie Larrabee was given the task of spying on Crazy Horse for the military, so the [...] "marriage" [...] is suspect.
