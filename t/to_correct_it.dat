5|$|During childhood, Goebbels {{suffered}} from ill health, {{which included a}} long bout of inflammation of the lungs. He had a deformed right foot that turned inwards, due to a congenital deformity. It was thicker and shorter than his left foot. He underwent a failed operation <b>to</b> <b>correct</b> <b>it</b> just prior to starting grammar school. Goebbels wore a metal brace and special shoe because of his shortened leg, and walked with a limp. He was rejected for military service in World War I due to his deformity.|$|E
5|$|Micro Machines was {{completed}} in September 1990. The game did not go through quality assurance, and as a result, a major bug that caused the game to crash was discovered near completion. The bug occurred when the player tried to reverse on the first race, and escaped notice because none of the testers thought to do so as {{they thought it was}} so easy. It was determined that just one binary bit was wrong, and a device that functioned like a miniature Game Genie was installed on the cartridges <b>to</b> <b>correct</b> <b>it,</b> as by the time the bug was discovered, there were plenty of ROM chips containing the bugged version. Micro Machines was released for the NES by Camerica in 1991. Nintendo wanted development halted because Codemasters did not have a licence from them, and sued Galoob over the sales of the Game Genie. Courts ruled in Galoob's favour (Nintendo appealed, but the ruling was upheld), but the legal issues meant that sales of the NES version were not as good as hoped.|$|E

A hazard can be played onto an opponent's battle area even if another one is already showing, but only the topmost hazard needs to be corrected before that player can use a Roll card. Playing a Roll against a Stop hazard corrects it and allows the player to start moving; a second Roll is not needed.|$|E

As the manga takes place in July 1999, Yuki expressed a goal to complete the series by then.

U.S. intelligence-community {{officials}} questioned the accuracy of McConnell's testimony and urged his office <b>to</b> <b>correct</b> <b>it,</b> which he did in a statement issued September 12, 2007. Critics cited the incident {{as an example of}} the Bush administration's exaggerated claims and contradictory statements about surveillance activities. Counterterrorism officials familiar with the background of McConnell's testimony said they did not believe he made inaccurate statements intentionally as part of any strategy by the administration to persuade Congress to make the new eavesdropping law permanent. Those officials said they believed McConnell gave the wrong answer because he was overwhelmed with information and merely mixed up his facts.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862, Hill was {{positioned}} near the Confederate right along a ridge; {{because of some}} swampy ground along his front, there was a 600-yard gap in Hill's front line, and the nearest brigade behind it was nearly a quarter mile away; the dense vegetation prevented the brigade commander from seeing any Union troops advancing on his position. During the battle, Maj. Gen. George Meade's division routed two of Hill's brigades {{and part of a}} third. Hill required the assistance from Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early's division to repulse the Union attack. Hill's division suffered over 2,000 casualties during the battle, which was nearly two-thirds of the casualties in Jackson's corps; two of his brigade commanders were wounded, one (Maxcy Gregg) mortally. After the battle one of his brigade commanders, Brig. Gen. James J. Archer, criticized him about the gap left in the division's front line, saying that Hill had been warned about it before the battle but had done nothing <b>to</b> <b>correct</b> <b>it.</b> Hill was also absent from his division, and there is no record of where he was during the battle; this led to a rumor spread through the lines that he had been captured during the initial Union assault.|$|E

[...] His recovery was particularly tortuous, requiring daily runs around the cricket field and an intensive gym program under the supervision of Dr. Arthur Jackson, an advocate of slow running therapy to build stamina. He played no part in the international arena in 1975, and managed only four first-class appearances, though these returned a healthy 18 wickets at 18.77. He was not to return to the Test game until 1976, where he faced the West Indies in two matches in July and August.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, {{vascular}} surgeon Paolo Zamboni suggested that MS involves a vascular process {{he referred to}} as chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI), in which veins from the brain are constricted.

This theory received important attention {{in the media and}} among MS patients, specially in Canada. Concern has been raised with Zamboni's research as it was neither blinded nor controlled, and additionally its assumptions about the pathophisiology of the disease may not be backed by known data. Also further studies have either not found a relationship or found a much less strong one. This has raised serious objections to the hypothesis of CCSVI originating MS. The [...] "liberation procedure" [...] has been criticized for possibly resulting in serious complications and deaths while its benefits have not been proven. Currently it is recommended not to use the proposed treatment unless its effectiveness is confirmed by controlled studies. Research on CCSVI has been fast tracked but researchers have been unable to confirm whether CCSVI has a role in causing MS.|$|E
