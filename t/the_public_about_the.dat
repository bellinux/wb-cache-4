5|$|By the 1910s, {{the use of}} breaker boys was {{dropping}} because of improvements in technology, stricter child labor laws, and the enactment of compulsory education laws.

5|$|In May 2009, the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) {{announced}} that fixing SR67 was number17 on its priority list, {{resulting in an}} estimated 2030 completion of a four-lane highway {{that would not be}} limited-access.

Signs were installed in 2010 to encourage drivers to practice safe driving habits; from January 2007 to early December2010, twenty-four people died from accidents on SR67. Following a March 2009 fatal crash, some of the survivors filed a lawsuit against Caltrans for negligence in maintaining and designing the highway, but the suit was decided in favor of the department. In a 2010 report, Caltrans suggested that two lanes could be added along the highway from I-8 to Dye Road in order to improve traffic flow.|$|E
5|$|On the {{day prior}} to the game, spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win by 11.5 points.

Both Beamer and Air Force head coach Fisher DeBerry were among the longest-tenured coaches in college {{football}} at the time.

The game would be an opportunity for DeBerry to gain his 150th career win and defeat a ranked team {{for the first time}} since 1999.

5|$|Since Catarina was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone to make landfall in Brazil {{since the beginning of}} reliable records, and hence infrastructure and the population were not specifically prepared for it, the damage was quite severe. Although the storm was an unprecedented event, Brazilian officials took the appropriate actions and warned <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> approaching storm.
