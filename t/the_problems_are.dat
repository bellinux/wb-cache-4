5|$|Concerns {{over the}} state of the {{environment}} around the most popular parts of the Mont Blanc massif, and the need for visitors to better respect it, were reflected in a statement in 2014 by Jean-Marc Peillex, the mayor of Saint-Gervais, who said:Mont Blanc is a heap of garbage... a mountain covered with the crap, urine and detritus of the last 50 years. <b>The</b> <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> covered up by a nice, white blanket of snow. But I want to confront people with the reality and to reach those people who abuse the mountain. Following the construction of the new Goûter Hut used by most climbers ascending Mont Blanc, the authorities now strictly enforce a 'no wild-camping' ban above the level of Tête Rousses Hut. Each high altitude hut faces its own individual challenges, often relating to water and energy supply or waste management, and the provision of services to visitors can sometimes conflict with environmental protection. A range of individual solutions for a selection of huts within the massif and elsewhere in the Alps was identified by a project run by Espace Mont Blanc between 2007 and 2013.|$|E

50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> linear we can {{use some}} type of matrix inverse method—often <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> ill-posed or {{unstable}} so {{we will need to}} regularize it: good, simple methods include the normal equation or singular value decomposition.

25|$|Colorado Springs {{has many}} {{features}} of a modern urban area, such as parks, bike trails, and urban open-area spaces. However, it is not exempt from problems that typically plague cities that experience tremendous growth, such as overcrowded roads and highways, crime, sprawl, and government budget issues. Many of <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> indirectly or directly caused by the city's difficulty in coping with the large population growth experienced in the last twenty years, and the annexation of the Banning Lewis Ranch area to accommodate further population growth of 175,000 future residents.|$|E
25|$|The {{graphics}} received {{mixed reviews}} with reviewers praising the lighting effects {{as well as}} interior and exterior details of premium cars, stating that Photo Mode showed off their detailed graphical design very well, but commented negatively on the detail of standard cars which lacked cockpit views, looked like up-scaled versions taken from Gran Turismo 4 and did not keep up {{to the level of}} detail found in the premium models.

25|$|Sturm–Liouville {{theory is}} a theory of a special type of second order linear {{ordinary}} differential equations. Their solutions are based on eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions of linear operators {{defined in terms of}} second-order homogeneous linear equations. <b>The</b> <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> identified as Sturm-Liouville Problems (SLP) and are named after J.C.F. Sturm and J. Liouville, who studied such problems in the mid-1800s. The interesting fact about regular SLPs is that they have an infinite number of eigenvalues, and the corresponding eigenfunctions form a complete, orthogonal set, which makes orthogonal expansions possible. This is a key idea in applied mathematics, physics, and engineering. SLPs are also useful in the analysis of certain partial differential equations.|$|E
500|$|Intractability and the {{combinatorial}} explosion. In 1972 Richard Karp (building on Stephen Cook's 1971 theorem) showed {{there are}} many problems that can probably only be solved in exponential time (in {{the size of the}} inputs). Finding optimal solutions to these problems requires unimaginable amounts of computer time except when <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> trivial.

500|$|Poulenc {{turned to}} opera {{only in the}} latter half of his career. Having {{achieved}} fame by his early twenties, he was in his forties before attempting his first opera. He attributed this to the need for maturity before tackling the subjects he chose to set. In 1958 he told an interviewer, [...] "When I was 24 I was able to write Les biches [...] it is obvious that unless a composer of 30 has the genius of a Mozart or the precociousness of Schubert he couldn't write The Carmelites– <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> too profound." [...] In Sams's view, all three of Poulenc's operas display a depth of feeling far distant from [...] "the cynical stylist of the 1920s": Les mamelles de Tirésias (1947), despite the riotous plot, is full of nostalgia and a sense of loss. In the two avowedly serious operas, Dialogues des Carmélites (1957) and La Voix humaine (1959), in which Poulenc depicts deep human suffering, Sams sees a reflection of the composer's own struggles with depression.|$|E
