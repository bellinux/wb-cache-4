5|$|North American shipped {{spacecraft}} CM-012 to Kennedy Space Center on August 26, 1966 under a conditional Certificate of Flight Worthiness: 113 significant incomplete planned engineering changes had to {{be completed}} at KSC. But that was not all; an additional 623 engineering change orders were made and completed after delivery. Grissom became so frustrated with {{the inability of the}} <b>training</b> <b>simulator</b> engineers {{to keep up with the}} spacecraft changes, that he took a lemon from a tree by his house and hung it on the simulator.|$|E

500|$|The {{engineers}} who programmed the Apollo <b>training</b> <b>simulator</b> {{had a difficult}} time keeping the simulator in sync with the continuous changes being made to the spacecraft. According to backup astronaut Walter Cunningham, [...] "We knew that the spacecraft was, you know, in poor shape relative to what it ought to be. We felt like we could fly it, but let's face it, it just wasn't as good as it should have been for the job of flying the first manned Apollo mission." [...] NASA pressed on, and mid-January 1967, preparations were being made for the final pre-flight tests of Spacecraft 012.|$|E
500|$|Respawn {{produced}} both {{free and}} paid post-release downloadable content {{and offered a}} season pass discount for pre-purchasing. Three DLC packs are expected with the season pass. The first Titanfall downloadable content (DLC) pack, Expedition, was announced at PAX East 2014 for release in May 2014. Its story occurs after the campaign in the ancient alien ruins of [...] "Swampland", water [...] "Runoff", and <b>training</b> <b>simulator</b> [...] "War Games" [...] maps. Upcoming DLC will likely not change the number of Titan chassis. Electronic Arts designed the game's digital strategy to coexist with their other shooter, Battlefield 4, and the game does not use microtransactions. The free updates include features such as private matches that were {{left out of the}} original release for time restrictions. The private match feature was added in April 2014. An additional, free update will bring new burn cards and multiplayer modes, and an upcoming PC patch will add 4K video and Nvidia graphics processing unit support. The company is also planning a companion smartphone app.|$|E
2500|$|The second prototype, 46-681, had {{an engine}} failure during takeoff from Edwards AFB {{in the summer}} of 1951. Republic test pilot Carl Bellinger escaped from the {{aircraft}} just as the tail melted off only 90 seconds into the flight. By the time fire apparatus arrived, driving seven miles across the dry lake bed, the tail section had been reduced to ashes. 46-681 was then fitted with a [...] "V" [...] (or [...] "butterfly") tail, and was flight-tested with this configuration. It was later used at Edwards AFB as a crash-crew <b>training</b> <b>simulator,</b> then scrapped.|$|E

2500|$|Benton's FPS-35 was {{modified}} and [...] "tested {{during the summer}} of 1962" [...] to track Cape Canaveral missile launches ("marginal ability"), and Benton AFS had Backup Interceptor Control capability by December 1962(General Electric AN/GPA-37 Course Directing Group). An AN/FPS-8 backup search radar owned/operated by the FAA was in place by September 1967, when new [...] "AN/GPA-98, ECM <b>training</b> <b>simulator,</b> and AN/FYQ-48, the new digital data processor which replaces the AN/FST-2" [...] were planned. Before 1974 when the AN/FPS-35 was replaced, FCC direction-finding equipment was used after the radar [...] "scopes would light up like light bulbs" [...] almost every morning for a half-hour—a noisy UHF TV tuner in the area was located which was being used for a [...] "soap opera on one of the local channels".|$|E
2500|$|After {{selecting}} a pilot file, the player views the [...] "concourse", a hub with doors to different {{features of the}} game. While {{the main focus of}} gameplay is completing battles, the concourse also offers several other areas. The <b>training</b> <b>simulator</b> lets the player fly each of the pilotable Imperial craft through a complex obstacle course. The combat chamber offers four extra missions for each craft, ranging from training scenarios to historical reenactments of important missions. There is also a room to view mission recordings, and a tech room to view information about every spacecraft that appears in the game. When the player selects a mission, he or she is given a briefing, consisting of a dialog describing the mission and an animated map illustrating vessel positions and basic flight patterns. The player may optionally read a list questions and answers about the mission.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{engineering}} simulations entail mathematical {{modeling and}} computer assisted investigation. There are many cases, however, where mathematical modeling is not reliable. [...] Simulation of fluid dynamics problems often require both mathematical and physical simulations. [...] In these cases the physical models require dynamic similitude. Physical and chemical simulations have also direct realistic uses, rather than research uses; in chemical engineering, for example, process simulations {{are used to}} give the process parameters immediately used for operating chemical plants, such as oil refineries. Simulators are also used for plant operator training. It is called Operator <b>Training</b> <b>Simulator</b> (OTS) and has been widely adopted by many industries from chemical to oil and to power industry. This created a safe and realistic virtual environment to train board operators and engineers. Mimic is capable of providing high fidelity dynamic models of nearly all chemical plants for operator training and control system testing.|$|E
