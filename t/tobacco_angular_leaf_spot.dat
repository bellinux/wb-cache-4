The objective {{of this study was}} to select sources {{of resistance}} to <b>angular</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> and anthracnose from a diverse group of germplasm with known resistance to these diseases and other abiotic and biotic factors. Atotal of 173 common beans that included 46 landraces and 127 breeding lines were evaluated at two locations (Estación Experimental Fabio Baudrit Moreno and Sub-Estacion Experimental Fraijanes, both of Universidad de Costa Rica) in 1996 and 1997. A mixture of four races (races 9, 10, 547, and 1024 of maximum virulence and coverage in Costa Rica) of the anthracnose pathogen was used to inoculate four times. Because of high natural incidence of <b>angular</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot,</b> inoculation was not necessary. Twenty-one landraces and 13 breeding lines were resistant (disease score of 3 or less) to antracnose.

Os experimentos foram conduzidos em condições de campo, nas safras outono-inverno (1994) e das águas (1994 / 95), cada uma com três semeaduras sucessivas de feijão. A severidade da mancha-angular e da ferrugem aumentou significativamente da primeira para a terceira semeadura, atingindo nível mais elevado na última. As semeaduras anteriores foram a fonte de inóculo para os cultivos subseqüentes. Aplicações de fungicida foram eficientes no controle das doenças, permitindo um aumento significativo da produção de grãos, quando comparado com o controle. A mancha-angular apresentou maior incidência no outono-inverno e nas águas, e a ferrugem, apenas no outono-inverno. Nessas safras as condições climáticas (temperatura e umidade relativa) favoreceram a evolução das doenças, resultando num aumento da severidade.

However, the severity reduction of all four diseases by combination C 01 composed of isolates DFs 093 and DFs 769 of Bacillus cereus and DFs 831 of Pseudomonas fluorescens {{was significantly higher than}} if the seeds were microbiolized by a single isolate of a biocontrol agent...|$|R
40|$|<b>Angular</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> of Phaseolus vulgaris is {{a serious}} disease caused by Phaeoisariopsis griseola, in which two major gene pools occur, namely Andean and Middle-American. Sequence {{analysis}} of the SSU region of nrDNA revealed the genus Phaeoisariopsis to be indistinguishable from other hyphomycete anamorph genera associated with Mycosphaerella, namely Pseudocercospora and Stigmina. A new combination is therefore proposed in the genus Pseudocercospora, a name to be conserved over Phaeoisariopsis and Stigmina. Further comparisons by means of morphology, cultural characteristics, and DNA sequence analysis of the ITS, calmodulin, and actin gene regions delineated two groups within P. griseola, which are recognised as two formae, namely f. griseola and f. mesoamericana. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{yield of}} South African bean lines was {{assessed}} in Malawi, using 3 groups with 15 genotypes each. In the 1 st trial, {{carried out in}} 4 different agroecological zones, Carioca 80 was the best genotype with high yields at all sites (712 - 1768 kg/ha) and resistant to <b>angular</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> and rust. Other genotypes performed well at several sites: BAT 1514, PVBZ 1782, PVA 340, PVA 773, PVA 262, PVBZ 1589, and PVBZ 1713. Highest yields were obtained in Dedza (av. 1523 kg/ha) and the lowest in Matapwata (av. 276 kg/ha). BAT 1514, PVBZ 1589, and PVBZ 1782 were also resistant to <b>angular</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> and rust in Champhira and Lunyangwa. All cv. were susceptible to floury <b>leaf</b> <b>spot.</b> In the 2 nd trial, also conducted at 4 different sites, the highest yields (av. 889 kg/ha) and the greatest resistance to <b>angular</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> (av. 1. 7) were obtained in Mzimba. The best South African genotypes were Umvoti, Kompasberg, H 7822 -C 2, PC 222 - 5 -D 2, PC 166 -C 39, and Enselini. Seed size was generally large in Champhira, with 100 -seed wt. of 52 g. All genotypes were susceptible to <b>angular</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> and rust, but several were resistant to Ascochyta in Bunda. In the 3 rd trial, carried out in Bunda, local genotype Nyauzembe had the highest production (1016 kg/ha), followed by the South African lines PC 213 - C 3, Umvoti, Type 2 White, PC 167 -C 6, and PC 351 - 19 (772, 740, 671, 731, and 647 kg/ha, resp.). Generally all the South African lines had small seeds and high susceptibility to rust. (CIAT) Se evaluo el rendimiento de lineas de frijol sudafricanas en Malawi, utilizando 3 grupos con 15 genotipos cada uno. En el primer ensayo, realizado en 4 zonas agroecologicas diferentes, el mejor genotipo fue Carioca 80 con altos rendimientos en todos los sitios (712 - 1768 kg/ha), con resistencia a mancha foliar angular y roya. Otros genotipos presentaron un buen desempeno en varios de los sitios: BAT 1514, PVBZ 1782, PVA 340, PVA 773, PVA 262, PVBZ 1589, PVBZ 1713. Los mayores rendimientos se obtuvieron en Dedza (prom. 1523 kg/ha) y los mas bajos en Matapwata (prom. 276 kg/ha). BAT 1514, PVBZ 1589 y PVBZ 1782 tambien presentaron resistencia a mancha foliar angular y roya en Champhira y Lunyangwa. Todos los cv. fueron susceptibles a la mancha harinosa de la hoja. En el segundo ensayo, tambien realizado en 4 sitios diferentes, se obtuvieron las producciones mas altas (prom. 889 kg/ha) y la mayor resistencia a mancha foliar angular (prom. 1. 7) en Mzimba. Los mejores genotipos sudafricanos fueron Umvoti, Kompasberg, H 7822 - C 2, PC 222 - 5 -D 2, PC 166 -C 39 y Enselini. El tamano de semilla fue generalmente grande en Champhira, alcanzando medidas hasta de 52 g/ 100 semillas. Todos los genotipos fueron susceptibles a mancha foliar y roya, pero algunos fueron resistentes a Ascochyta en Bunda.

40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o efeito de isolados de Bacillus cereus e Pseudomonas putida sobre a severidade da mancha-angular do feijoeiro, em condições de campo. Quatro experimentos foram conduzidos em épocas favoráveis à mancha-angular (Pseudocercospora griseola), com as cultivares Pérola e Ouro Negro. Os experimentos foram realizados em delineamento de blocos ao acaso, com seis repetições. Os tratamentos foram pulverizações sobre as plantas com três estirpes de B. cereus (UFV- 172, UFV- 101 e UFV- 75) e duas estirpes de P. putida (UFV- 53 e UFV-Pp), acibenzolar-S-metil, fungicida clorotalonil e controle pulverizado com água, no total de oito tratamentos. Os tratamentos foram aplicados por atomização no filoplano de plantas de feijoeiro, semanalmente, a partir do 15 º dia após a emergência até o fim do ensaio. Calculou-se a área abaixo da curva de progresso da mancha-angular do feijoeiro; a doença ocorreu naturalmente. A produção foi avaliada pela massa média de sementes por planta. Os antagonistas foram eficientes em reduzir a severidade da doença, em comparação à testemunha, e obtiveram o mesmo nível de controle do tratamento químico. O menor índice de severidade da doença propiciou melhor produção do que o tratamento controle. The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the effect of Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas putida isolates on {{the severity of the}} <b>angular</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> of common bean under field conditions. Four trials were carried out in favorable seasons to <b>angular</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> (Pseudocercospora griseola), using the cultivars Pérola and Ouro Negro. The assays were assembled in a randomized block design with six replicates. The treatments were plant-sprayings with three strains of B. cereus (UFV- 172, UFV- 101 and UFV- 75) and two strains of P. putida (UFV- 53 and UFV-Pp), acibenzolar-S-methyl, chlorothalonil fungicide and the control with water, in a total of eight treatments. The treatments were applied weekly by spraying the phylloplane of bean plants, starting from the 15 th day after seedling emergency {{until the end of the}} assay. The area under the disease progress curve of the <b>angular</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> was calculated; the disease occurred naturally. Yield was evaluated by the average seed mass per plant. The antagonists were effective in reducing the severity of the disease, in comparison to the control, and they had the same control level as the chemical treatment. The lowest index of the disease severity provided the best yield, in comparison to the control treatment...|$|R
40|$|Inheritance of {{resistance}} to <b>angular</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> (ALS) disease caused by Phaeoisariopsis griseola (Sacc.) Ferr was investigated in two common bean cultivars, Mexico 54 and BAT 332. Both Andean and Mesoamerican backgrounds {{were used to determine}} the stability of the resistance gene in each of the two cultivars. Resistance to P. griseola was phenotypically evaluated by artificial inoculation {{with one of the most}} widely distributed pathotypes, 63 – 39. Evaluation of the parental genotypes, F 1, F 2 and backcross populations revealed that the resistance to <b>angular</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> in the cultivars Mexico 54 and BAT 332 to pathotype 63 – 39 is controlled by a single dominant gene, when both the Andean and Mesoamerican backgrounds were used. Allelism test showed that ALS resistance in Mexico 54 and BAT 332 to pathotype 63 – 39 was conditioned by the same resistance locus. Resistant and susceptible segregating populations generated using Mexico 54 resistant parent were selected for DNA extraction and amplification to check for the presence /absence of the SCAR OPN 02 and RAPD OPE 04 markers linked to the Phg- 2 resistance gene. The results indicated that the SCAR OPN 02 was not polymorphic in the study populations and therefore of limited application in selecting resistant genotypes in such populations. On the other hand, the RAPD OPE 04 marker was observed in all resistant individuals and was absent in those scored susceptible based on virulence data. Use of the RAPD OPE 04 marker in marker-assisted selection is underway. Peer-reviewe...|$|R
