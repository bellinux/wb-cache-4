40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{demonstrate}} whether the signal intensity (SI) of myocardial infarction (MI) on contrast enhanced (CE) -cine MRI is useful for differentiating recently infarcted myocardium from chronic scar. This study included 24 patients with acute MI (36 - 84 years, mean age: 57) and 19 patients with chronic MI (44 - 80 years, mean age: 64). The diagnosis of acute MI was based on the presence of typical symptoms, i. e. elevation of the cardiac enzymes and the absence of any remote infarction history. The diagnosis of chronic MI was based on a history of MI or coronary artery disease of more than one month duration and on the absence of any recent MI within the previous six months. Retrospectively, the ECG-gated breath-hold cine imaging was performed in the short axis plane using a segmented, balanced, turbo-field, echo-pulse sequence two minutes after the administration of Gd-DTPA at a dose of 0. 2 mmol/kg body weight. Delayed contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE <b>MRI)</b> in <b>the</b> same plane was performed 10 to 15 minutes after contrast administration, and this was served as the gold standard of reference. The SI of the infarcted myocardium on <b>the</b> CE-cine <b>MRI</b> was compared with that of the normal myocardium on the same image. The area of abnormal SI on <b>the</b> CE-cine <b>MRI</b> was compared with the area of hyperenhancement on <b>the</b> DCE <b>MRI.</b> <b>The</b> area of high SI on <b>the</b> CE-cine <b>MRI</b> was detected in 23 of 24 patients with acute MI (10 with homogenous high SI, 13 high SI with subendocardial low SI, and one with iso SI). The area of high SI on <b>the</b> CE-cine <b>MRI</b> was larger than that seen on <b>the</b> DCE <b>MRI</b> (p < 0. 05). In contrast, the areas of chronic MI were seen as iso-SI with thin subendocardial low SI on the CE-cine MR in all the chronic MI patients. The presence of high SI on both <b>the</b> CE-cine <b>MRI</b> and <b>the</b> DCE <b>MRI</b> is more sensitive (95. 8 %) for determining the age of a MI than the presence of myocardial thinning (66. 7 %).

30|$|We {{believe that}} {{knowledge}} of <b>the</b> ultrafast <b>MRI</b> sequence {{is useful to}} paediatric orthopaedic surgeons for the following reasons. First, ultrafast <b>MRI</b> can confirm <b>the</b> location of the femoral head without any motion artefact in non-sedated infants after the reduction with spica cast application, with an acquisition time of only 1.0  s per one axial or coronal image. In other words, no sedation or general anaesthesia is required for confirmation of the concentricity of the femoral head after spica cast application. Second, if <b>the</b> ultrafast <b>MRI</b> result shows pseudo-reduction, the re-casting procedure can be performed immediately after the imaging study (Fig.  3).

25|$|EEG {{has several}} strong points {{as a tool}} for {{exploring}} brain activity.

Other methods of looking at brain activity, such as PET and fMRI have time resolution between seconds and minutes. EEG measures the brain's electrical activity directly, while other methods record changes in blood flow (e.g., SPECT, fMRI) or metabolic activity (e.g., PET, NIRS), which are indirect markers of brain electrical activity. EEG can be used simultaneously with fMRI so that high-temporal-resolution data can be recorded at the same time as high-spatial-resolution data, however, since the data derived from each occurs over a different time course, the data sets do not necessarily represent exactly the same brain activity. There are technical difficulties associated with combining these two modalities, including the need to remove <b>the</b> <b>MRI</b> gradient artifact present during MRI acquisition and the ballistocardiographic artifact (resulting from the pulsatile motion of blood and tissue) from the EEG.

METHODS: Ten infants with an ALTE (aged between 6 and 31 weeks) were clinically graded according to the PRISM score and evaluated with EEG, evoked potentials and <b>MRI.</b> <b>The</b> 18 <b>MRIs</b> obtained were distributed in 3 classes according to the delay after which they were obtained; class A (n= 5) : within the first 48 hours after the event, class B (n= 7) : between day 3 and 8 and class C (n= 6) : between day 9 and 50. <b>The</b> 18 <b>MRIs</b> were evaluated retrospectively using a scoring system based on 3 categories of lesions: edema, basal ganglia injury and watershed injuries.
