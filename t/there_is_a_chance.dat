5|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone can cease to have tropical characteristics {{in several different}} ways. One such way is if it moves over land, thus depriving it of the warm water it needs to power itself, quickly losing strength. Most strong storms lose their strength very rapidly after landfall and become disorganized areas of low pressure {{within a day or}} two, or evolve into extra{{tropical cyclone}}s. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> a tropical cyclone could regenerate if it managed to get back over open warm water, such as with Hurricane Ivan. If it remains over mountains for even a short time, weakening will accelerate. Many storm fatalities occur in mountainous terrain, when diminishing cyclones unleash their moisture as torrential rainfall. This rainfall may lead to deadly floods and mudslides, {{as was the case with}} Hurricane Mitch around Honduras in October 1998. Without warm surface water, the storm cannot survive.|$|E
5|$|Workers {{are known}} to produce their own eggs, but these eggs are unfertilised and hatch into male ants. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of workers attacking a {{particular}} individual who has successfully produced male offspring due {{to a change in}} a workers cuticular hydrocarbon; cuticular hydrocarbons are believed to {{play a vital role in}} the regulation of reproduction. However, this is not always the case. Myrmecia is one of several ant genera which possess gamergate workers, where a female worker is able to reproduce with mature males when the colony is lacking a queen. Myrmecia workers are highly fertile and can successfully mate with males. A colony of M. pyriformis without a queen was collected in 1998 and kept in captivity, during which time the gamergates produced viable workers for three years. Ovarian dissections showed that three workers of this colony mated with males and produced female workers. Queens have bigger ovaries than the workers, with 44 ovarioles while workers have 8 to 14. Spermatheca is present in M. gulosa workers, based on eight dissected individuals showing a spermatheca structurally similar to those found in queens. These spermathecas did not have any sperm. Why the queen was not replaced is still unknown.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{theory can}} argue against the {{selection}} of the deferred gratification trait since there are both costs and risks associated with delaying gratification behavior. One such cost is the basic opportunity cost associated with time spent waiting. While waiting, individuals lose time {{that could be used to}} find other food. Seeking high calorie food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage. There are also two risks associated with being patient. First, there is a risk that another animal might get to the food first, also known as an interruption risk. Second, there is the risk that the chance to get the reward will be cut short, perhaps by a predator, also known as a termination risk. These costs and risks create situations in which the fitness of the individual is threatened. There are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in the real world. For example, animals that eat fruit have the option of eating unripe fruit right away, or waiting, delaying gratification, until it becomes ripe. The interruption risk plays a part here, because if the individual forgoes the unripe fruit, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> that another individual may come along and get to it first. Also, in extractive foraging, such as with nuts and shellfish, the outer shell creates a delay. However, animals that can store food and defer eating are more likely to survive during harsh conditions, and thus delaying gratification may also incur an evolutionary advantage.|$|E

5|$|Zelenin and Jimenez {{respectively}} {{side with}} Law and Chaos, while a resurrected Gore becomes Neutral. Depending on the choices {{made during the}} game, the protagonist has the choice of allying with either Law, Chaos or following a Neutral route and continuing with the original mission. If he sides with Law, the protagonist and Zelenin defeat both Jimenez and Mem Aleph before using the Cosmic Eggs to create a World of Law, with Zelenin worshiped as a channel to God for humanity, which is forced to surrender its free will. If he sides with Chaos, he and Jimenez help Mem Aleph and defeat Zelenin, using the Eggs to fulfill the Schwarzwelt's original purpose and create a world where humans and demons live together in a primal world where only the strong survive. In both the Law and Chaos routes, Arthur chooses to destroy his new personality to save the protagonist after the Red Sprite is damaged by Gore. If the protagonist rejects Law and Chaos, Gore transmits the necessary information {{for the destruction of}} the Schwarzwelt to him before truly passing on. After defeating Zelenin, Jimenez, and Mem Aleph, the protagonist and surviving crew escape in the Red Sprite while Arthur sacrifices himself to ensure the destruction of the Schwarzwelt, although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of it reappearing if humanity continues its abuse of the Earth.|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{the length}} of drug abuse, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> that the immune system can be damaged.

In addition to morphological changes of the heart which may alter cardiovascular inefficiency irreversibly.|$|E
25|$|Direct reciprocity. Research {{shows that}} it can be {{beneficial}} to help others if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> that they can and will reciprocate the help.

25|$|In {{many cases}} seed predators support plant populations by {{dispersing}} seeds {{away from the}} parent plant. By dispersing seeds away from the parent plant the seed predator is in effect supporting gene flow between populations. Other seed predators collect seeds and then store or cache them for later consumption. In {{the case that the}} seed predator is unable to locate the buried or hidden seed <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> that it will later germinate and grow, supporting the species dispersal.|$|E
25|$|Hahn’s {{views on}} {{education}} centred {{on the ability}} to understand different cultures. Gordonstoun incorporates this {{in a number of ways}} including its association with Round Square and in offering pupil exchanges to the different schools within the association. Additionally <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to join one of the annual international service projects which take pupils abroad to help a foreign community, for instance there have been projects to build schools in Africa, build wells in Thailand and help orphans in Romania.|$|E
25|$|Others have {{suggested}} that fractional pricing was first adopted as a control on employee theft. For cash transactions with a round price, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> that a dishonest cashier will pocket the bill rather than record the sale. For cash transactions with an odd price, the cashier must make change for the customer. This generally means opening the cash register which creates {{a record of the}} sale in the register and reduces the risk of the cashier stealing from the store owner.|$|E

25|$|Due to a {{deficiency}} of the enzyme diaphorase I (NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase), methemoglobin levels rise {{and the blood}} of met-Hb patients has reduced oxygen-carrying capacity. Instead of being red in color, the arterial blood of met-Hb patients is brown. This results in the skin of Caucasian patients gaining a bluish hue. Hereditary met-Hb {{is caused by a}} recessive gene. If only one parent has this gene, offspring will have normal-hued skin, but if both parents carry the gene, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> the offspring will have blue-hued skin.|$|E
25|$|Single-elimination {{style or}} {{knock-out}} style are also sometimes used for chess tournaments. In fact, {{the first international}} chess tournament was held in single-elimination style. In single-elimination tournaments, the loser of a game is immediately eliminated from winning the first prize. In most single-elimination chess tournaments <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> for players to compete for positions other than first. Players are normally given seeds based on their rating {{in order to prevent}} the highest ranked players from facing each other early in the competition. Double-elimination tournaments work {{in the same way as}} single-elimination tournaments except that a player loses eligibility to take first prize after two losses.|$|E
25|$|However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> {{that these}} water {{pressure}} activated inflation devices do not inflate the life jacket {{if a person}} is wearing waterproof clothing and falls into the water face-down. In these cases the buoyancy of the clothing holds a person on the water surface, which prevents the hydrostatic release. As a result, a person can drown although wearing a fully functional life jacket. In addition there are some circumstances in which the use of self-triggering devices can result in the wearer becoming trapped underwater. For example, the coxswain of a bowloader rowing shell risks being unable to escape should the craft capsize.|$|E

The School is currently {{in the second phase}} of accreditation as a PYP school. Despite its relative success, however, the IB Middle Years Program (MYP) has not been introduced into the Middle School. Both the PYP and the MYP are specifically designed for an introduction into the IB, and, due to the popularity of the IB among students, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> that the MYP will be brought into the Middle School in years to come, although the School has neither confirmed nor denied this.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} physics, when a ball is rolled {{slowly up}} a large hill, it will {{come to a stop}} and roll back, because it doesn't have enough energy to get {{over the top of the}} hill to the other side. However, the Schrödinger equation predicts that there is a small probability that the ball will get to the other side of the hill, even if it has too little energy to reach the top. This is called quantum tunneling. It is related to the distribution of energy: although the ball's assumed position seems to be on one side of the hill, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of finding it on the other side.|$|E
25|$|A {{functional}} analysis {{is the most}} direct form of functional behavior assessment, in which specific antecedents and consequences are systematically manipulated to test their separate effects {{on the behavior of}} interest. Each manipulation of the antecedent and consequence in a particular situation is referred to a condition. In a {{functional analysis}}, conditions are typically alternated between quite rapidly independent of responding to test the different functions of behavior. When data paths are elevated above the control condition (described below) {{it can be said that}} there is a functional relation between that condition and the behavior of interest. Complexity, time restraints, and setting restraints, are a few limitations to this particular method. When deciding to use this method, it should be noted that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of high-risk behavior and the possibility of low-rate behaviors.|$|E

25|$|Gene {{sequence}} {{within the}} genome is conserved across the family {{due to a}} phenomenon known as transcriptional polarity (see Mononegavirales) in which genes closest to the 3’ end of the genome are transcribed in greater abundance than those towards the 5’ end. This {{is a result of}} structure of the genome. After each gene is transcribed, the RNA-Dependent RNA polymerase pauses to release the new mRNA when it encounters an intergenic sequence. When the RNA polymerase is paused, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> that it will dissociate from the RNA genome. If it dissociates, it must reenter the genome at the leader sequence, rather than continuing to transcribe the length of the genome. The result is that the further downstream genes are from the leader sequence, the less they will be transcribed by RNA polymerase.|$|E
