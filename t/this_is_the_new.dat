In the May 11, 1968, issue of Rolling Stone, he wrote about the album A Long Time Comin' by U.S. band Electric Flag: [...] "Nobody who's been listening to Mike Bloomfield—either talking or playing—in {{the last few years}} could have expected this. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> soul music, the synthesis of white blues and heavy metal rock." [...] In January 1970 Lucian K. Truscott IV reviewing Led Zeppelin II for the Village Voice described the sound as [...] "heavy" [...] and made comparisons with Blue Cheer and Vanilla Fudge.|$|E
500|$|The Goddess-oriented {{festival of}} Durga Puja in the Hindu month of Ashvin (October) is celebrated for sixteen days, {{culminating}} with Vijayadashami. On Vijayadashami, Vimala is worshipped by the titular Gajapati king of Puri as the goddess Durga, who {{is believed to}} have slain the demon Mahishasura on this day. The earliest record of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Delhi Konark stele, which narrate that King Narasimhadeva I (reign: 1238–1264) worshipped Durga-Madhava (Vimala-Jagannath) on the tenth day of Durga Puja, that is, Vijayadashami. As the goddess is believed to assume a destructive aspect during the Durga Puja, women are debarred in the temple as they are considered too [...] "weak-hearted" [...] to witness this terrible form of the goddess.|$|E
500|$|Desperate for a break, the overworked band {{began to}} argue and {{tensions}} formed. Raynor, {{who was at}} the center of this drama, had been commenting of his desire to attend college for years, and had been taking homework out with him on tour to try and complete his high school diploma. The tension came to a head in February 1998 as the band embarked on SnoCore, described as [...] "a winter version of the Warped Tour." [...] Sharing the stage with Primus, the band was enjoying more success than ever before, but the drama between the musicians had grown substantially. The band reached a low point when the band engaged in a fight on a Nebraska date after SnoCore's conclusion. Raynor would depart following SnoCore, and the ensemble recruited Travis Barker, drummer for the opening ska punk group The Aquabats, to fill in for Raynor. Barker, who had not had time to prepare or practice with the duo, learned the drum tracks for the 20-song setlist in only 45 minutes before the first show and performed them flawlessly thereafter. [...] "I remember Travis rehearsing backstage for an hour or two, then playing with them during sound-check," [...] said Adam Deibert of the Aquabats. [...] "A few of us were standing behind the stage and vividly remember the feeling of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> Blink. We should have looked for a new drummer right then because it was obvious what band he belonged in." [...] Shortly thereafter, the band embarked on a short minitour along the western coast, most notably Southern California, the band's favorite place to play. The tour ended with the band headlining a sold-out show at the Palladium in Hollywood, California, where the band had dreamed of performing at for years. [...] Raynor returned for the band's Palladium performance, but the band became increasingly uneasy and arguments grew worse. To offset personal issues and a [...] "tragic loss," [...] Raynor began to drink heavily and it began to affect the band's performances.|$|E

2500|$|Malfatti {{had her own}} solo exhibition, Exposição de Pintura Moderna in São Paulo, Brazil from December 12, 1917 to January 11, 1918. Although Malfatti {{carefully}} chose her artworks {{so as not to}} offendfor example, she omitted her nudes {{from the}} expositionher work was still highly criticized. In New York she had been heralded as another member of the avant-garde artists, but in Brazil her art was not recognized to be a positive contribution in the important search of nationalism and traditions within art. One of the reasons why Malfatti became such a scandal was because her art was displayed as a one-person show. Instead of having many different artists revealing their intentions of bringing Brazilian art into context of globally modernist innovations such as Post-Impressionism or Cubism to Brazil, Malfatti was seen as an individual who caused scandal to the carefully and rather conservatively minded Brazilians whose only desire was to continue the fin-du siecle romantic style. As Batista argues, Malfatti's thought was something similar to, [...] "I'm not the only person who paints in this style unfamiliar to you; out there, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>new,</b> current art many others are experimenting with." [...] However, despite the fact that Malfatti was an artist riding the global wave of thought and style, in Brazil she was simply viewed as an alien artist with no link to the Brazilian culture. Therefore, Malfatti's internationalism only further estranged her from Brazilian's expectations of art and of her art in particular.|$|E

60|$|This {{therefore}} is {{the manner of}} our coming, if we come aright to the throne of grace for mercy, we must come by blood through his flesh, as through the veil; by which, until you have entered through it, the glory of God, {{and that he is}} resolved that grace shall reign, will be utterly hid from your eyes. I will not say, but by the notion of these things, men may have their whirling fancies,[17] and may create to themselves wild notions and flattering imaginations of Christ, the throne of grace, and of glory; but the gospel knowledge of this is of absolute necessity to my right coming to the throne of grace for mercy. I must come by his blood, through his flesh, or I cannot come at all, for here is no back door. This then is the sum, Christ's body is the tabernacle, the holiest; 'thy law,' saith he, 'is within my heart,' or in the midst of my bowels (Psa 40:7,8). In this tabernacle then God sitteth, to wit, on the heart of Christ, for that is the throne of grace. Through this tabernacle men must enter, that is, by a godly understanding of what by this tabernacle or flesh of Christ has been done to reconcile us to God that dwells in him. This is the way, all the way, for there is no way but this to come to the throne of grace. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> way into the heavenly paradise, for the old way is hedged and ditched up by the flaming sword of cherubims (Gen 3:24).
