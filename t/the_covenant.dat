5|$|Covenant {{theology}} is an interpretive framework used by Reformed theologians which was significantly {{developed during the}} seventeenth century. Under this scheme, as articulated by the Assembly, God's dealings with men are {{described in terms of}} two covenants: <b>the</b> <b>covenant</b> of works and covenant of grace. The Westminster Confession was the first major Reformed symbol to explicitly mention <b>the</b> <b>covenant</b> of works (sometimes called <b>the</b> <b>covenant</b> of life), in which God offered Adam eternal life on condition of perfect obedience. In the fall of man, Adam broke <b>the</b> <b>covenant</b> of works by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. To remedy this, God offered salvation apart from human initiative in what was called <b>the</b> <b>covenant</b> of grace. This covenant allowed man to enjoy eternal life despite his inability to obey God's law perfectly. The idea of <b>the</b> <b>covenant</b> of grace was a much more common feature of orthodox Reformed theology. The Westminster divines set these two covenants against each other as the two major ways in which God deals with people.|$|E

5|$|A Covenant army {{attacks the}} academy causing {{confusion}} and panic.

5000|$|Protestant {{opinions}} on supersessionism vary. These differences arise from dissimilar literal versus figurative approaches {{to understanding the}} relationships between <b>the</b> <b>covenants</b> of <b>the</b> Bible, particularly the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>covenants</b> of <b>the</b> Old Testament and <b>the</b> New <b>Covenant.</b> [...] In consequence, there is a range of viewpoints, including: ...|$|R

60|$|Third, <b>The</b> new <b>covenant</b> promiseth thee a new heart, as I said before; but <b>the</b> old <b>covenant</b> promiseth none; {{and a new}} spirit, but <b>the</b> old <b>covenant</b> promiseth none (Eze 36:26). <b>The</b> new <b>covenant</b> conveyeth faith, but the old one conveyeth none (Gal 3). Through <b>the</b> new <b>covenant</b> <b>the</b> love of God is {{conveyed}} {{into the}} heart; but through <b>the</b> old <b>covenant</b> there is conveyed none of it savingly through Jesus Christ. Romans 5. <b>The</b> new <b>covenant</b> doth not only give a promise of life, but also with that the assurance of life, but the old one giveth none; <b>the</b> old <b>covenant</b> wrought wrath in us and to us, but the new one worketh love (Rom 4:15; Gal 5:6).

50|$|The Covenants: Armstrong {{taught that}} <b>the</b> New <b>Covenant</b> is an 'amplification' of <b>the</b> Old <b>Covenant,</b> and that certain laws (excluding temple and {{unenforceable}} ancient civil laws) from <b>the</b> Old <b>Covenant</b> {{are still in}} effect for Christians. This included laws such as literal Sabbath keeping, 'Clean and Unclean' meats and Holy Day observances. He believed that <b>the</b> New <b>Covenant</b> was yet future, to be finalized as a marriage covenant between Christ and the Church and that Christians currently existed 'between' <b>the</b> two <b>Covenants.</b> Critics say that Armstrong confused <b>the</b> two <b>Covenants</b> and selectively picked which aspects of <b>the</b> two <b>Covenants</b> to keep.|$|R

5|$|ODST {{takes place}} in the 26th century, when humans under the command of the United Nations Space Command (UNSC) are locked in a war with a theocratic {{alliance}} of alien races known as <b>the</b> <b>Covenant.</b> During the events of the 2004 video game Halo 2, <b>the</b> <b>Covenant</b> discover the location of Earth and launch an assault on the city of New Mombasa in Africa.

While the rest of Halo 2s storyline follows the ship to an ancient installation identical to the first Halo, ODST focuses on the aftermath of the shockwave, while <b>the</b> <b>Covenant</b> still occupy the city.|$|E
