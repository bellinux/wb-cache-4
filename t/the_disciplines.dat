5|$|The {{education}} of Pedro II began {{while he was}} still heir to throne, and he learned to read and write in Portuguese at age five. His first tutors were Mariana de Verna and Friar Antonio de Arrábida. When he became Emperor he already had several professors. Amongst these were Félix Taunay (father of Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay) and Luís Alves de Lima e Silva (son of the regent Francisco de Lima e Silva), who taught French and Fencing respectively, and towards both of whom he developed lifelong friendship and admiration. Pedro II passed the entire day studying with only two hours reserved for amusements. He would wake up at 6.30a.m. and begin studies at seven, continuing until 10p.m., after which he would go to bed. <b>The</b> <b>disciplines</b> were diverse, including everything from languages, history, philosophy, astronomy, physics, geography and music, to hunting, equestrianism and fencing.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difficult}} area was feats. Although common feats worked well, with a random {{chance of success}} or failure, uncommon ones would appear to fail more often. To avoid this, randomization {{was replaced by a}} degree of difficulty in accomplishing the feat. Although pen-and-paper falling damage is random, the computer game bases damage on the distance of the fall. The team's biggest challenge was adapting disciplines. The pen-and-paper version may require a little blood that requires a long time to use, or have no blood cost and can be used at will; upgraded disciplines had additional requirements considered too confusing for a computer game. Troika attempted to equalize <b>the</b> <b>disciplines,</b> keeping the effect intact and normalizing the cost, so a first-level power requires one blood point, a second-level two points and so on. To balance the clans, the aristocratic Ventrue were only allowed to feed on noble blood, though this was changed to allow them to feed on lower-class humans, receiving less blood. During character creation, the game had an optional character biography with unique positive and negative characteristics (increasing one ability while limiting another). This was removed from the released game; Activision felt that there was insufficient test time, and removing it was a more stable option.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the rules for the conduct of Quaker life and the framework of organisation within which those rules operated, known generally as <b>the</b> <b>discipline,</b> in <b>the</b> period from- 1758 to 1861. It begins with the first codification of the rules in 1758 and ends with the publication of the fourth edition of <b>the</b> book of <b>discipline,</b> embodying <b>the</b> results of major reforms, in 1861. <b>The</b> <b>discipline</b> and <b>the</b> organisation of the Society in 1758 are first described in detail and the study then proceeds to describe the development of <b>the</b> <b>discipline</b> up to 1861, explaining where possible the influences responsible for that development. The obvious focal points between 1758 and 1861 are the years of publication of the printed books of discipline in 1785, 1802, 1854 and. 1861 following the pattern of the manuscript Christian and Brotherly Advices issued in 1738. The other chief events in the Society's history concerning the development of <b>the</b> <b>discipline</b> were the-movement for the so-called revival of <b>the</b> <b>discipline</b> in <b>the</b> 1760 s and an essentially theological controversy known as the Beacon in the 1850 s, when <b>the</b> <b>discipline</b> was ineffectively applied and produced a schism on a small scale. The movement for the revival of <b>the</b> <b>discipline</b> was <b>the</b> major symptom of the discontent with the state of the Society felt by influential Friends throughout the period. This discontent reached crisis point {{at the end of the}} period when Friends realised the seriousness of their dwindling numbers. This study attempts to evaluate the responsibility of <b>the</b> <b>discipline</b> for this situation and deals finally with the major reforms in <b>the</b> <b>discipline</b> that were incorporated in <b>the</b> book of <b>discipline</b> in 1861...|$|R
