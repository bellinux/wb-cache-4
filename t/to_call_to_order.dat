50|$|Wards {{continue}} to have beadles, with most having just one, but the larger wards two or three. This is an ancient elected office that is now largely ceremonial, in that they accompany their alderman on the eight high ceremonial occasions in the City's civic calendar and in attending <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>order</b> the wardmote, an annual meeting in each ward of electors, representatives and officials.

50|$|The Constitution {{is silent}} {{on the issue of}} the quorum needed <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>order</b> a {{parliamentary}} presidential electoral meeting. In the absence of a clear provision designating the quorum needed to elect the President, the constitution is open to differing interpretations. According to one view on the issue, a quorum constituting a majority of fifty-percent plus one (that required for any meeting of Parliament) is sufficient for a parliamentary presidential electoral meeting. Another view on the issue argues that the quorum is a two-third majority of the total members of Parliament as Article 49 of the constitution requires a two-third voting majority to elect the President in the first round and, if the quorum were half plus one, there would have been no need to require the two-third voting majority when the number of deputies present at the meeting does not exceed the quorum.|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in 1992. By that time, Nelson's assets had been auctioned; the items were returned to Nelson by fans and friends who purchased them. Nelson promoted the album during a benefit concert {{for the restoration of}} the Texas State Capitol. During an appearance on Primetime Live, Nelson wore a T-shirt with the nonexistent toll-free number 1-800-IRS-TAPE, that allegedly was the number <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>order</b> the album. After 500 calls, Jon Richards, the owner of Visual Technology. Inc., announced that he would let Nelson lease or purchase the number to help the sales of the album. Besides the phone orders, Nelson also negotiated with Sony Music to distribute the album in stores. The IRS collected US$3.6 million from the sales of the album, and after a payment of US$9 million during the next five years, Nelson's debt was satisfied.Entertainment Weekly rated the album with a B+: [...] "The album features only Nelson's warm, emotive baritone and the deft accompaniment of his acoustic guitar. All of these tunes explain how he came close to being a deity in his native Texas, bringing together hippies and rednecks in pure appreciation of his music." ...|$|E

5000|$|The roda commences {{with the}} ladainha (litany), a solo often sung {{by the most}} senior member present, usually the one playing lead berimbau. These songs may be improvised on the spot, but are most often chosen from a canon of extant ladainhas. The ladainha varies in from as little as two lines, to 20 or more. Topics for this song type include moral lessons, stories, history, mythology, can be topical for a {{particular}} occasion as well as pure poetry, and almost always metaphorical. The song is loosely strophic and the melody {{is pretty much the}} same throughout the entire ladainha repertoire, with some variations here and there.The ladainha uses quatrain form as a template, with the first line almost always repeated.Iê...êEu já vivo enjoadoEu já vivo enjoadode viver aqui na terraamanhã eu vou pra luafalei com minha mulherela então me respondeuque nos vamos se deus quiserVamos fazer um ranchinhotodo feito de sapéamanhã as sete horasnos vamos tomar cafée o que eu nunca acreditei,o que não posso me conformarque a lua vem à terrae a terra vem à luatodo isso é conversapra comer sem trabalharo senhor, amigo meu, colega velhoescute bem ao meu cantarquem é dono não ciumae quem não é vai ciumarcamaradinhoIeeeeeI am sickof living here on EarthTomorrow I'll go to the MoonI said to my wifeAnd she respondedThen we'll go, God willingWe'll have a little ranchAll made of strawTomorrow morning at sevenWe'll have some coffeeWhat I never believedNor could I ever confirmThe moon would come to EarthAnd the Earth to the MoonThis is just talkto eat without workingSir, good friend, old colleagueListen well to my songHe who is the master of his land doesn't envyAnd he who isn't certainly willCamaradinhoAn interpretation of this song could be: Nothing comes easy without hard work.The person who sings the ladainha cries out [...] "Ieeeeeeee" [...] (pronounced YaaaaaaaaY) <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>order</b> the attendees of the roda, that the roda is starting.

Nevertheless, under the aggressive politicalization of his art, Grosz questioned {{the movements of the}} masses whatever its tendency was.
