25|$|The {{debate was}} {{characterized}} by two opposing factions, the reformists and <b>the</b> <b>modernists.</b> <b>The</b> reformists were largely Confucian scholars who opposed the policies of Emperor Wu and demanded {{the abolition of the}} monopolies on salt and iron, an end to the state price stabilization schemes, and huge cuts in government expenditures to reduce the burden on <b>the</b> citizenry. <b>The</b> <b>Modernists</b> supported <b>the</b> continuation of Emperor Wu's policies in order to appropriate the profits of private merchants into state coffers to fund the government's military and colonization campaigns in the north and west.|$|R

5|$|A book {{published}} by Nationalmuseum in 1992 on Carl Larsson {{claims that the}} most immediate and natural explanation for the ultimate rejection of the painting {{was the fact that}} time had rendered the painting unfashionable. Because of the long debate, the painting became a survivor from a time past and it could not meet <b>the</b> <b>modernist</b> ideals of the new century.|$|E
5|$|Another {{trend in}} {{contemporary}} Danish architecture is {{the emergence of}} a new generation of successful young practices, inspired more by international trends than by <b>the</b> <b>modernist</b> tradition in Scandinavia. The generation is spearheaded by Bjarke Ingels whose firm BIG (Bjarke Ingels Group) founded in 2006 has made an unusually rapid transition into a well-established firm.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of Communist rule, much housing was built quickly and cheaply for the huge influx of people fleeing the {{countryside}} following World War II, sometimes resulting in the brutalist architecture of the Blokovi ("Blocks") of New Belgrade; a socrealism trend briefly ruled, resulting in buildings like the Trade Union Hall. However, in the mid-1950s, <b>the</b> <b>modernist</b> trends took over, and still dominate the Belgrade architecture.|$|E
50|$|Malek o-Sho'arā Bahār was {{the poet}} laureate of Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar. He {{was born in}} Mashhad in 1884 (d. 1951) and was a {{conservative}} figure among <b>the</b> <b>modernists.</b>|$|R
25|$|As {{complaints}} surfaced criticizing {{more and}} more about the government's policies, the regent Huo Guang, who was the de facto ruler of China after Emperor Wu of Han, called a court conference to debate whether the policies of Emperor Wu should be continued. The resulting debate was divided into two groups, the reformists and <b>the</b> <b>modernists.</b> <b>The</b> reformists, largely provincial Confucian scholars, backed privatization and a return to the laissez-faire policies of old. <b>The</b> <b>modernists,</b> on <b>the</b> other hand, largely represented the interests of the central government and were more in tune with legalist philosophy, as well as being admirers of the previous Qin dynasty, whose harsh and numerous laws had been based on legalist principles.|$|R
5000|$|In the VALS study, Mitchell {{identified}} three major values groups in society: <b>the</b> Traditionalists, <b>the</b> <b>Modernists</b> and <b>the</b> Cultural Creatives. The Traditionalists, {{as he saw}} them, were {{those who wanted to}} return to the 1950s, with mom in the kitchen and the white picket fence around <b>the</b> house. <b>The</b> <b>Modernists</b> were those who thought technology would solve all our problems. And the Cultural Creatives, consisting of two subgroups of [...] "Greens" [...] and [...] "Spiritual Seekers," [...] were people who were self-directed and interested both in developing themselves in fulfilling ways and in being of service to the larger community.|$|R
5|$|Marc Chagall {{was born}} in Liozna (near Vitebsk) in 1887. He spent the World War I years in Soviet Belarus, {{becoming}} one of the country's most distinguished artists and a member of <b>the</b> <b>modernist</b> avant-garde and was a founder of the Vitebsk Arts College.|$|E
5|$|The building's {{original}} design in <b>the</b> <b>modernist</b> New Objectivity style {{was the subject}} of a competition which was eventually won by the architect Hans Poelzig. On its completion, the complex was the largest office building in Europe and remained so until the 1950s. The IG Farben Building's six square wings retain a modern, spare elegance, despite its mammoth size. It is also notable for its paternoster elevators.|$|E
5|$|Built with a {{range of}} shops to both sides, <b>the</b> <b>modernist</b> design of the {{entrance}} vestibule {{takes the form of a}} double-height box clad in white Portland stone with a three-part glazed screen on the front façade divided by columns of which the capitals are three-dimensional versions of the Underground roundel. The central panel of the screen contains a large version of the roundel. The ticket hall beyond is octagonal with a central roof light of the same shape. The ticket hall originally had a pair of wooden ticket booths (passimeters) from which tickets were issued and collected, but these were removed when modern ticketing systems made them redundant.|$|E
5000|$|There were {{a variety}} of {{socio-cultural}} events that shaped the publication and reaction to Civic Biology. Following World War I, a cultural movement emerged that poised two ideological groups against each other: the traditionalists and <b>the</b> <b>modernists.</b> <b>The</b> <b>modernists</b> embraced intellectual experimentation by exploring new philosophies such as Freudian theories and advocated against alcohol prohibition in political spheres. In response to this modernist cultural movement, there was a religious revivalist movement to protest the emergence of these progressive ideologies. The traditionalists were distinguished by their religious zeal. This group favored alcohol prohibition laws and a literal interpretation of the Bible.|$|R
50|$|The {{tradition}} influenced later styles such as <b>the</b> <b>Modernists</b> of <b>the</b> follow-on Second Bay Tradition. Transitional architects {{associated with}} the bridge between these two traditions were Henry Higby Gutterson and John Hudson Thomas.|$|R

5|$|By 1964 over 20,000 {{new homes}} had been built, {{transforming}} the dense overcrowded and unsanitary slums of the pre-war city into a low density, dispersed suburbia. Most {{of the city}} centre shops had been destroyed and those that remained were cleared to enable a zoned reconstruction according to his plan. In 1962 <b>the</b> <b>modernist</b> high rise of the Civic Centre was constructed, an architecturally significant example of mid-twentieth century civic slab-and-tower set piece. The Plymouth City Council allowed it to fall into disrepair but it was grade II listed in 2010 by English Heritage to prevent its demolition.|$|E
5|$|Construction on <b>the</b> <b>Modernist</b> {{hotel was}} to have started {{in the spring of}} 1970. However, {{construction}} on the , $23 million hotel and office building did not begin until June 1971. The Loews Hotels chain agreed to co-finance construction of the property with L'Enfant Plaza Corp., although details of the agreement were not provided. The hotel would occupy the top four floors and lobby of the 12-story building, with separate elevators for office tenants and hotel guests. The 378-room hotel, designed by Koubek, had a rooftop swimming pool, two restaurants, a cocktail lounge, and meeting rooms. The general contractor for the building was George Hyman Construction Co. (now Clark Construction Group).|$|E

5|$|Wilde was {{initially}} {{buried in the}} Cimetière de Bagneux outside Paris; in 1909 his remains were disinterred and transferred to Père Lachaise Cemetery, inside the city. His tomb there was designed by Sir Jacob Epstein. It was commissioned by Robert Ross, who asked for a small compartment {{to be made for}} his own ashes, which were duly transferred in 1950. <b>The</b> <b>modernist</b> angel depicted as a relief on the tomb was originally complete with male genitalia, which have since been vandalised; their current whereabouts are unknown.

5|$|After the Great War, Moore {{received}} an ex-serviceman's grant {{to continue his}} education and in 1919 he became {{a student at the}} Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to <b>the</b> <b>modernist</b> works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum.|$|E
5|$|Although {{part of the}} Los Angeles {{metropolitan}} area, {{the university}} is {{in close proximity to}} two other large metropolitan and culturally-defined regions, the Inland Empire and Orange County. The university has a tier 1 area, defined as a geographical admissions region surrounding the campus, roughly bounded by the San Gabriel Mountains to the north, the city of Chino Hills to the south, Interstate 605 to the west, and Interstate 15 to the east. Cal Poly Pomona's campus buildings vary in age and style from the Mission Revival Kellogg Horse Stables and the Kellogg House (suggesting the Spanish colonial architectural heritage of Southern California) built in the 1920s; <b>the</b> <b>modernist</b> box-like portion of the library completed in 1969; to contemporary dormitories, engineering, science and library-expansion facilities completed in the early 21st century.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>modernists</b> {{were headed}} by Sang Hongyang, an ex-merchant {{who had been}} {{selected}} by Emperor Wu to administer to his new interventionist policies. They justified the imposition of controls {{on the grounds that}} they would thus wrest profits from wealthy private merchants that could pose a threat to the state and bring them into state coffers; particularly, modernists claimed that salt and iron industrialists were [...] "brutal and tyrannical," [...] who employed thousands of workers that could potentially become rebels. <b>The</b> <b>modernists</b> took <b>the</b> view that with its iron monopoly the state could effectively distribute tools of good quality for the use of the peasant, as well as stabilizing the price of many essential goods. They also claimed that private workshops were too small, unspecialized, and poorly equipped. <b>Modernists</b> claimed <b>the</b> government workshops offered better working conditions and access to more materials than private workshops. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>modernists</b> claimed that <b>the</b> expansionist campaigns were necessary to defend China from barbarian incursions, and that by nationalizing the salt and iron industries the state could obtain the funds needed to defend the empire without imposing additional burdens on the peasantry.|$|R
5|$|Central Briarcliff West is a {{neighborhood}} {{which has a}} number of mansions built by 20th-century millionaires who stayed at the Briarcliff Lodge and later built estates in the area. The lodge stood in the area and on the highest point of Walter Law's estate from its construction in 1902 until it burned down in 2003. Other historic estates in the neighborhood include the Law family homes (built in 1902 for Walter Law's children) and Law's estate, the Manor House, all on Scarborough Road. The three estates for his children are Six Gables, Mt. Vernon, and Hillcrest. <b>The</b> <b>Modernist</b> Julian Street, Jr. residence house, designed by Wallace Harrison for Julian and Narcissa Vanderlip Street, {{was one of the first}} contemporary-style homes in Westchester.

When <b>the</b> <b>modernist</b> Islamic organisation Muhammadiyah opened a branch in Gresik in 1922, Fakih {{was one of}} the first to join. Extremely active in the group, he became the Gresik branch's leader within three years, and under his leadership the group was formally recognised by the central Muhammadiyah administration. Through his work with the Muhammadiyah in Gresik, Fakih became better known. He later transferred to the branch in Surabaya, a much larger city where, in 1929, he was chosen to sit on the city council. He also remained active in commerce, running a construction material trade and shipbuilding shop. During this period he served on the local chamber of commerce.|$|E
5|$|Hollamby {{was born}} in his parental home of 6 Wellesley Avenue in Hammersmith, West London.

His primary {{education}} took place at St. Peter's Church School, before he won a scholarship to study at a junior technical school. From there, he gained a higher education by training in architecture at the nearby Hammersmith School of Arts and Crafts during the 1930s. At the college, he {{was inspired by the}} Arts and Crafts aesthetic propounded by one of his lecturers, Alwyn Waters, and through him came to take an interest in William Morris, who had been a pioneer of the Arts and Crafts movement {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century. At the same time, Hollamby was influenced by <b>the</b> <b>modernist</b> movement in architecture to which two of his favourite lecturers, Arthur Ling and Alex Lowe, belonged, and joined the Modern Architectural Research Group (MARS).|$|E
