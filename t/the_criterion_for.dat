5|$|Due to the unanticipated {{relocation}} of Arlene, only one tropical cyclone watch or warninga tropical storm warning for coastal areas from Brownsville to Matagorda on June19was ever {{issued by the}} NHC {{in association with the}} cyclone. Issued 21hours before landfall, the warning was discontinued after the system moved inland. Prior to the warning, Arlene had satisfied <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>for</b> a tropical storm watch as a developing tropical depression. However, the NHC and various National Weather Service forecast offices opted to delay the watch {{as a result of the}} poorly organized appearance of the cyclone at the time. Given the weak nature of Arlene and the relatively unpopulated extent of coast which it impacted, evacuations were minimal – only fifteen fled from summer homes along Magnolia Beach and Indianola, Texas due to the threat of flooding.|$|E

The Philippines abolished the method in 2006, though a bill to reinstate it passed through the House of Representatives and as of July 2017 is still awaiting debate in the Senate. While it is still legal, no executions have been carried out in Guatemala since 2000, and in Thailand since 2009. The United States and China are the two biggest users of this method of execution. The U.S. had executed 1,283 people via lethal injection as of April 2017. The number of people executed annually in China is thought to surpass all other countries combined, though the actual number is a state secret, and the percentage of people killed via lethal injection and the other method of execution used there, firing squad, is also unclear. This alphabetical list features notable cases up to September 2017, and only those where lethal injection can be reliably sourced to be the method of execution. <b>The</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>for</b> notability is an article on the individual in the English Wikipedia, which inevitably causes a bias towards U.S. executions, as notable individuals in other countries such as Thailand and Vietnam may only have articles in their own language.

Four hundred thirty-four caregivers for disabled elderly persons in a suburban city were surveyed by in-home interviews. Two hundred ten non-caregivers were also interviewed as an age and gender-matched control group. Overall, 16. 8 % of caregivers met <b>the</b> DSM-III-R <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> major depression and 10. 6 % met <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> depressive disorders not otherwise specified, {{for a total of}} 27. 4 % meeting <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> affective disorders, while 8. 6 % of controls met <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> depressive disorders not otherwise specified. The prevalence of major depression in caregivers was associated with mental problems and ADL limitations of the elderly. Moreover, non-cooperation by other family members or relatives contributed to an increase in the prevalence of depression. Caregivers who met <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> major depression had a higher frequency and longer duration of upper respiratory infections than other caregivers or controls, and showed greater fatigue than the other caregivers or controls. Approximately 90 % of caregivers who met <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> major depression had also insomnia.

25|$|The Transcendentalists {{emphasised}} an intuitive, experiential {{approach of}} religion.

In the late 18th and early 19th century, the first translations of Hindu texts appeared, which were also read by the Transcendentalists, and influenced their thinking. They also endorsed universalist and Unitarianist ideas, leading to Unitarian Universalism, {{the idea that there}} must be truth in other religions as well, since a loving God would redeem all living beings, not just Christians.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>for</b> {{assessing}} {{a belief}} system for Hume {{is based on}} the balance of probability whether something is more likely than not to have occurred. Since the weight of empirical experience contradicts the notion for the existence of miracles, such accounts should be treated with scepticism. Further, the myriad of accounts of miracles contradict one another, as some people who receive miracles will aim to prove the authority of Jesus, whereas others will aim to prove the authority of Muhammad or some other religious prophet or deity. These various differing accounts weaken the overall evidential power of miracles.|$|E
25|$|Another way {{to think}} of the proof is that B, empty or non-empty, is always in the power set of A. For f to be onto, some element of A must map to B. But that leads to a {{contradict}}ion: no element of B can map to B because that would contradict the criterion of membership in B, thus the element mapping to B must not be an element of B meaning that it satisfies <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>for</b> membership in B, another contradiction. So the assumption that an element of A maps to B must be false; and f cannot be onto.|$|E

25|$|Structural {{analysis}} is {{the branch of}} mechanical engineering (and also civil engineering) devoted to examining why and how objects fail and to fix the objects and their performance. Structural failures occur in two general modes: static failure, and fatigue failure. Static structural failure occurs when, upon being loaded (having a force applied) the object being analyzed either breaks or is deformed plastically, depending on <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>for</b> failure. Fatigue failure occurs when an object fails {{after a number of}} repeated loading and unloading cycles. Fatigue failure occurs because of imperfections in the object: a microscopic crack {{on the surface of the}} object, for instance, will grow slightly with each cycle (propagation) until the crack is large enough to cause ultimate failure.|$|E
25|$|Using <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>for</b> Kaldor–Hicks {{improvement}}, {{an outcome}} is an improvement if {{those that are}} made better off could in principle compensate those that are made worse off, so that a Pareto improving outcome could (though does not have to) be achieved. For example, a voluntary exchange that creates pollution would be a Kaldor–Hicks improvement if the buyers and sellers are still willing {{to carry out the}} transaction even if they have to fully compensate the victims of the pollution. Kaldor–Hicks does not require compensation actually be paid, merely that the possibility for compensation exists, and thus need not leave each at least as well off. Under Kaldor–Hicks efficiency, an improvement can in fact leave some people worse off. Pareto-improvements require making every party involved better off (or at least no worse off).|$|E
25|$|As a brief example, Frame {{uses the}} {{epistemology}} of Kant, who taught that {{the categories of}} thought that are necessary for our understanding the world around us, such as causality, logic, time, space, and order, are structured by our minds and imposed upon the things we experience. In order to be rational and {{make sense out of}} life we must assume, or presuppose, these notions. Because we cannot empirically verify these categories by touch, smell, sight, etc. they must be thought of as created by and arising from our minds, thus ordering and providing <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>for</b> those things that we can empirically verify. This led Kant to conclude that if we are to think of anything at all we must think in terms of everything being caused by something logically and temporally prior to it. This led to a fairly deterministic view of mankind.|$|E

The scramble continued into the 1890s, and caused Britain to reconsider its decision in 1885 to withdraw from Sudan.

Sudan was nominally made an Anglo-Egyptian condominium, but a British colony in reality.|$|E

500|$|Agricultural {{output in}} 1980 was 21% {{higher than the}} average {{production}} rate between 1966 and 1970. Cereal crop output increased by 18%. These improved results were not encouraging. In the Soviet Union <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>for</b> assessing agricultural output was the grain harvest. The import of cereal, which began under Khrushchev, had in fact become a normal phenomenon by Soviet standards. When Brezhnev had difficulties sealing commercial trade agreements with the United States, he went elsewhere, such as to Argentina. Trade was necessary because the Soviet Union's domestic production of fodder crops was severely deficient. Another sector that was hitting the wall was the sugar beet harvest, which had declined by 2% in the 1970s. Brezhnev's way of resolving these issues was to increase state investment. Politburo member Gennady Voronov advocated for the division of each farm's work-force into what he called [...] "links". These [...] "links" [...] would be entrusted with specific functions, such as to run a farm's dairy unit. His argument was that the larger the work force, the less responsible they felt. This program had been proposed to Joseph Stalin by Andrey Andreyev in the 1940s, and had been opposed by Khrushchev before and after Stalin's death. Voronov was also unsuccessful; Brezhnev turned him down, and in 1973 he was removed from the Politburo.|$|E

Deep convection and banding features increased, and the depression intensified into a tropical storm early on September10.

By September11, an intermittent eye appeared, by which time the NHC estimated that Linda reached hurricane status.
