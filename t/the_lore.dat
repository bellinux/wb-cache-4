5|$|Despite the {{nationwide}} attention the incident received, the Mussel Slough Tragedy is not remembered much today {{as well as}} later gunfights such as the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Richard Maxwell Brown argues in No Duty to Retreat that the Mussel Slough shootout did not fit the mold of the gunfight/hero myth, which usually ignores such factors as ideology, and social and economic conflict, thus not implanting it in <b>the</b> <b>lore</b> of the American Old West.|$|E
5|$|The Pony Express {{demonstrated}} that a unified transcontinental system of communications could be established and operated year-round. When {{replaced by the}} telegraph, the Pony Express quickly became romanticized and became part of <b>the</b> <b>lore</b> of the American West. Its reliance on the ability and endurance of individual young, hardy riders and fast horses was seen as evidence of rugged American individualism of the Frontier times.|$|E
5|$|The Discourses are a {{collection}} of explanations and elucidations that Meher Baba has given on many topics that concern the advancement of the spiritual aspirant. Some {{of the most important}} topics treated are: sanskaras (mental impressions), Maya (the principle of illusion), the nature of the ego, reincarnation, karma, violence and non-violence, meditation, love, discipleship, and God-realization. His explanations often include stories from <b>the</b> <b>lore</b> of India and the Sufi culture. One such story, the wise man and the ghost, shows the power that superstitious beliefs can have on a person, while another, Majnun and Layla, show how selfless love, even in human relations, can lead one to discipleship.|$|E

50|$|The {{chestnut}}-capped thrush has a black {{back and}} a white belly with black spots. As its common name suggests, it has a chestnut cap. Its face is black with a white mark on the cheeks and another on <b>the</b> <b>lores.</b> <b>The</b> superficially similar chestnut-backed thrush is substantially larger when seen alongside one another, and has a black crown and rufous back, whereas the Enggano thrush has an olive-ochre back and little or no white on <b>the</b> <b>lores</b> and auriculars.|$|R
5|$|The Opies {{conducted}} {{a study of the}} use of truce terms throughout England, Scotland and Wales in the 1950s and published their results in a book called <b>The</b> <b>Lore</b> and Language of Schoolchildren. They found truce terms varied according to geographical location, with the exception of pax. In some places, more than one term was current and often four or five were known, although usually only one term predominated. Schools bordering two linguistic regions honoured both. The words used in urban areas were often at odds with words used in the surrounding countryside. The Opies recorded around 45 truce terms plus variations. The most widely used were barley, fainites, kings, crosses, keys, skinch, cree and scribs.|$|E
5|$|The Terrans are {{a fictional}} future version of {{humanity}} in the StarCraft series. The Terrans {{are the most}} splintered of the StarCraft species, consisting of multiple factions that not only fight the other races but each other as well. Considered an adaptive and mobile species, the Terrans are noted in <b>the</b> <b>lore</b> of the series {{for their ability to}} quickly access and drain a planet's resources. The Terrans have been dedicated a full campaign in each real-time strategy video game installment to date, and are defined in-game by their specialization of units and tactics of defense and mobility. In the series' storyline, the Terrans are usually displayed as being caught in-between the conflict between the Protoss and Zerg while also dealing with frequent civil wars.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Episode I in 2002, the Xenosaga project was reevaluated and staff reshuffled to allow newer staff members a chance to handle the series. Series creator and Monolith Soft co-founder Tetsuya Takahashi stepped down as director, taking on other {{responsibilities}} within the company {{in addition to being}} given wider creative input on projects. Takahashi's explanation was {{that he did not want}} to limit the scope and direction of the Xenosaga series, and that his style of direction as seen for Episode I could result in the development period becoming extended exponentially. During this period the Xenosaga series, originally planned by Takahashi as a six-part series, was rearranged into a trilogy, with the possibility of further episodes should the series meet continued success. The new director was Koh Arai, while Tomohiro Hagiwara became lead producer, both of whom had worked on Episode I in minor roles; Takahashi on an executive role overseeing Episode II, in addition to keeping the staff informed with <b>the</b> <b>lore</b> of Xenosaga.|$|E
50|$|The bill is stout and strong, {{yellowish}} overall with a dusky upper mandible. The bare facial skin {{is bright}} yellow, with a brown line running across <b>the</b> <b>lores.</b> <b>The</b> legs are greenish-yellow, and the iris is yellow.|$|R
50|$|It is 14-15 {{centimetres}} {{long and}} has a heavy black bill. The upperparts are yellow-green with dark streaking while the head and underparts are dark greyish, sometimes with faint streaking. The outer tail-feathers are mostly white {{and there may be}} a pale spot on <b>the</b> <b>lores.</b> Juvenile birds are similar to adults but are darker and greener. The lesser honeyguide is smaller with a less heavy bill. It has a paler head and underparts, less-streaked upperparts and a more conspicuous patch on <b>the</b> <b>lores.</b>|$|R
50|$|The varied lorikeet {{is about}} 19 cm long. It is mainly green with short yellow {{longitudinal}} streaks. <b>The</b> <b>lores,</b> forehead, and crown are red. The beak is red, the bare eye-rings are white, <b>the</b> <b>lores</b> are bare, and the irises are orange-yellow. The upper breast is mauve with longitudinal yellow streaks. The legs are bluish-grey. In the female the red {{on the head}} is less extensive, and the breast has duller colours. Juveniles are much duller and are mainly green with an orange forehead, pale-brown irises, and a brown beak that is orange at the base.|$|R
5|$|The most {{extensive}} {{study of the}} use and incidence of these terms is that undertaken by folklorists Iona and Peter Opie in the UK in their 1959 book, <b>The</b> <b>Lore</b> and Language of Schoolchildren, which mapped the use of truce terms across England, Wales and Scotland. The Opies considered it the most important word in a schoolchild's vocabulary and one for {{which there was no}} adult equivalent. There has been little recent research in the UK but such research as there has been indicates that truce terms, including some of those prevalent in the late 1950s, are still in general use. Studies conducted since the 1970s in English speaking cultures show that truce terms are also prevalent in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States with a number of terms deriving from older terms used in the UK, but many not.|$|E
5|$|The roster was {{selected}} internally by NetherRealm Studios with input from DC Comics. The main goal during the selection process, which took around {{three to four}} months, {{was to create a}} cast featuring a wide variety of characters. Characters were chosen based on criteria such as size, ability, gender, popularity, and how well they fit within the Injustice storyline. The addition of each playable hero and villain required about six weeks of development. The characters were designed with the intent to make each fighter unique, and fighting styles and movesets were tailored to <b>the</b> <b>lore</b> and personality of each character. Ed Boon stated that DC Comics had given NetherRealm a large amount of freedom with their properties, allowing them to put their own spin on characters. Several other characters from the DC Universe, such as Darkseid, Scarecrow, Metallo, and Gorilla Grodd, also appear as non-player characters, making cameo appearances in story cutscenes, stages, and other game modes. Outside of the DC universe, Scorpion from the Mortal Kombat series appears as a downloadable guest character.|$|E
5|$|The Drakengard games {{take place}} in a dark fantasy version of Medieval Europe called Midgard. Humans appear to be the {{predominant}} species, although races such as dragons, fairies and elves are shown to exist. The setting, mythos and landscape borrow extensively from <b>the</b> <b>lore</b> of Northern Europe. The world is overseen by a group of unnamed gods who have yet to make a personal appearance. The gods are served by beings known as the Watchers, entities created to destroy humanity because they are considered a failure. The Watchers are kept from entering the world with the seals, which act to keep the world in balance: should the seals be destroyed, the Watchers would enter the world and destroy humanity. At the core of the seals is the Goddess of the Seal, a mortal virgin female chosen and branded with the final seal: if all the seals are destroyed, all that stands between the Watchers and the world is the death of the Goddess herself. A core element of the Drakengard universe is the ability for humans and beasts to form a Pact, a magical bond which links their souls and grants the human partner great power at the cost of some physical ability or personal trait (their voice, singing abilities, etc.). Pacts are normally entered into by beasts so they can feed off negative emotions, but sometimes they will enter a pact for other reasons. A recurring element across the series is the representation of magic using the Celestial Alphabet, with a common letter arrangement representing the human gene.|$|E
50|$|A split {{supercilium}} divides above <b>the</b> <b>lores.</b> In some species, such as {{the jack}} snipe, the divided stripes reconnect again behind the eye. In others, {{such as the}} broad-billed sandpiper, the divided stripes remain separate.|$|R
50|$|The {{crown and}} upper nape of adult red-legged {{partridge}} are a warm pinkish-brown; the fore crown and lateral {{edges of the}} crown are pale blue-grey, and the bird has a narrow off-white supercilium running from above <b>the</b> <b>lores</b> to <b>the</b> sides of the lower nape. <b>The</b> <b>lores</b> have a solid bar of black feathering above a patch of pinkish-red skin. This black colouration continues behind the eye, where it broadens, and then extends down around the throat-patch to meet the upper edge of the gorget. There is a patch of pale buff-brown feathering on the ear-coverts, adjoining the black. The eye {{is surrounded by a}} bright red eye-ring.|$|R
5000|$|The {{supercilium}} is a plumage feature {{found on}} the heads of some bird species. It is a stripe which runs {{from the base of}} the bird's beak above its eye, finishing somewhere towards the rear of the bird's head. Also known as an [...] "eyebrow", it is distinct from the eyestripe, which is a line which runs across <b>the</b> <b>lores,</b> and continues behind the eye. Where a stripe is present only above <b>the</b> <b>lores,</b> and does not continue behind the eye, it is called a supraloral stripe or simply supraloral. [...] On most species which display a supercilium, it is paler than the adjacent feather tracts.|$|R

25|$|It is {{coincidental}} that RHGH also {{refers to}} rhesus monkey GH (RhGH), using the accepted naming convention of Rh for rhesus.

25|$|Knowledge of <b>the</b> {{fourteen}} <b>lores.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Juvenile [...] - [...] The plumage {{is similar}} to a non-breeding adult but a {{slightly}} paler sandy brown colour. <b>The</b> <b>lores</b> lack <b>the</b> black colour and the forehead, crown and nape are streaked dark brown. The bill is grey-black with a faint reddish base.|$|R
50|$|The Chinese egret averages 68 cm in height. The plumage {{is white}} {{throughout}} the bird's life and resembles the little egret Egretta garzetta. Outside the breeding season {{the bill is}} dusky with the basal portion being flesh coloured and <b>the</b> <b>lores</b> and legs are yellow-green, while the iris is yellow. All individuals are similar in this season. In the breeding season the adults develop a luxuriant crest which is sometimes over 11 cm long. It also develops long lanceolate plumes on its breast and dorsal plumes extending beyond the tail, called aigrettes and {{similar to those of}} little egret. The bare parts change too, the bill becomes a bright, almost orange, yellow while <b>the</b> <b>lores</b> turn bright blue and the legs black with yellow feet.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>lore</b> {{of some of}} the Klamath Tribes in {{the area}} held that Mount Shasta is {{inhabited}} by the Spirit of the Above-World, Skell, who descended from heaven to the mountain's summit at the request of a Klamath chief. Skell fought with Spirit of the Below-World, Llao, who resided at Mount Mazama by throwing hot rocks and lava, probably representing the volcanic eruptions at both mountains.|$|E
