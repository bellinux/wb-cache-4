25|$|The Wall Street Journal has {{continuously}} {{been a major}} {{voice of}} conservatism since the 1930s, and remains so since its takeover by Rupert Murdoch in 2007.

40|$|The aim of {{this essay}} was to examine whether 10 Swedish {{newspapers}} <b>editorial</b> <b>pages</b> and their leader writers changed their view on Mikhail Gorbachev before, {{during and after the}} August Coup in 1991. Moreover, the aim was also to see if <b>the</b> <b>editorial</b> <b>pages</b> used <b>the</b> same sources when they wrote about Gorbachev. In this essay four main questions were asked: - How is Gorbachev described before the August Coup? - How is Gorbachev described during the August Coup? - How is Gorbachev described after the August Coup? - What sources did <b>the</b> <b>editorial</b> <b>pages</b> use when they wrote about Gorbachev? Ten newspapers and their <b>editorial</b> <b>pages</b> from <b>the</b> period of 1 - 31 August and 1 - 6 September, as well as 10 - 31 December 1991 and 1 January 1992 were examined. It was discovered that most of <b>the</b> <b>editorial</b> <b>pages</b> changed their view from being negative in August to being more positive in December. As a conclusion it can be stated that <b>the</b> examined <b>editorial</b> <b>pages</b> did not write much about Gorbachev in the beginning of August and if they did mention him it was in a negative tone. One {{of the reasons for the}} lack of mentioning during the August Coup could be that the leader writers were not sure whether Gorbachev would return back to power. In December the views about Gorbachev were mostly positive, which could be related to the fact that the Soviet Union was about to become dissolved. Regarding the sources some of the newspapers referred to the same sources without giving clear information about where the source came from. A majority of <b>the</b> <b>editorial</b> <b>pages</b> referred to <b>the</b> meeting between Gorbachev and George Bush, as well as to Gorbachev’s meeting with the Supreme Soviet after the August Coup...|$|R

25|$|Some {{newspapers}} {{have dealt with}} the criticism by moving the strip from the comics page to <b>the</b> <b>editorial</b> <b>page,</b> because many people believe that a politically based comic strip like Doonesbury does not belong in a traditionally child-friendly comics section.

500|$|Ejler Jakobsson's tenure {{began with}} a large backlog of stories that Pohl had acquired, but {{within a year or}} two {{substantial}} changes were apparent. [...] In the early 1970s, Jakobsson attempted to update Galaxys image, adding a comic strip, [...] "Sunpot", by Vaughn Bodé, for example. Theodore Sturgeon took over from Budrys as the regular book reviewer in January 1972 and held the post until mid-1975. Jakobsson did not manage to give Galaxy a new and distinctive character: [...] "Sunpot" [...] lasted only four issues, Sturgeon's reviews were undistinguished, and many of the new authors he published have been, in the words of Mike Ashley, [...] "mercifully unknown ever since". [...] The paper quality and printing quality also dropped, and early cover designs were very weak. [...] Jakobsson initially printed guest editorials rather than writing his own; when he took over <b>the</b> <b>editorial</b> <b>page</b> his work was unremarkable. [...] However, he did manage to attract some of the new writers who were just becoming well known in the sf scene, including George R.R. Martin, Joe Haldeman, and Joanna Russ. [...] Three novels published in Jakobsson's Galaxy won awards: Isaac Asimov's The Gods Themselves and Arthur C. Clarke's Rendezvous with Rama each won both the Hugo and Nebula awards, in 1972 and 1973 respectively, and Robert Silverberg's A Time of Changes won the Nebula in 1971. Sturgeon's short story [...] "Slow Sculpture" [...] won both the Hugo and the Nebula in 1970.|$|E
