5|$|An {{approach}} to supporting the possibility premise in Plantinga's {{version of the}} argument was attempted by Alexander R. Pruss. He started with the 8th–9th century AD Indian philosopher Sankara's dictum that if something is impossible, we cannot have a perception (even a non-veridical one) that it is <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> It follows that {{if we have a}} perception that p, then even though it might not be <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that p, it is at least <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that possibly p. If mystics in fact perceive the existence of a maximally great being, it follows that the existence of a maximally great being is at least possible.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of games, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with stage magic. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained {{over a number of}} consecutive days.|$|E

40|$|The {{recovery}} of cpidemic hepatitis was {{investigated by the}} massexamination on <b>the</b> 340 <b>cases,</b> released from <b>the</b> treatment for not less than 6 mouths under the diagnosis of clinical recoverh. at Yoshikawa-Mura, Jyobo-Gun, Okayama in where the slight abortive form of epidemic hepatitis broke out in a large number. And the results were as follows. 1. <b>The</b> <b>cases</b> remaining of subjective symptom were 101 (29. 6 %) and their chief complaints were almost same to those on the course of disease. 2. Hepatomegaly was observed in 36. 8 % of <b>the</b> <b>cases.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cases</b> with palpable splenomegaly was observed in 2. 8 % and <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> with <b>the</b> enlargement of splenic dullness was observed in 19. 4 % of <b>the</b> <b>cases.</b> 3.

On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> showing a increased serum bilirubin were 4. 7 % and it was 10. 9 % on the consideration of <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> showing a slight increasion of serum bilirubin. 4.

5|$|Another {{question}} in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> {{was whether the}} High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, had jurisdiction to hear <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Hill argued {{that because of the}} structure of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the court could not hear <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> She argued that elections could not be disputed by petition if the dispute was about the eligibility of a candidate, as another provision of the Act meant that it would require a resolution of the relevant house of Parliament, the Senate in this case.|$|E
5|$|As in an oratorio, {{the written}} text in a choral symphony {{can be as}} {{important}} as the music, and the chorus and soloists can participate equally with the instruments in the exposition and development of musical ideas. The text can also help determine whether the composer follows symphonic form strictly, as in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of Rachmaninoff, Britten and Shostakovich, or whether they expand symphonic form, as in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of Berlioz, Mahler and Havergal Brian. Sometimes the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures, as with Szymanowski, Schnittke and, again, Havergal Brian. The composer can also choose to treat the text fluidly, in a manner more like music than narrative. Such was <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with Vaughan Williams, Mahler and Philip Glass.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Objective: In this study, the {{efficacy}} of thoracic ultrasonography during echocardiography was evaluated in newborns. Methods: Sixty newborns who had undergone pediatric cardiac surgery were successively evaluated between March 1, 2015, and September 1, 2015. Patients were evaluated for effusion, pulmonary atelectasis, and pneumothorax by ultrasonography, and results were compared with X-ray findings. Results: Sixty percent (n= 42) of <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> were male, <b>the</b> median age was 14 days (2 - 30 days), and the median body weight was 3. 3 kg (2. 8 - 4. 5 kg). The median RACHS- 1 score was 4 (2 - 6). Atelectasis was demonstrated in 66 % (n= 40) of <b>the</b> <b>cases.</b> Five of them were determined solely by X-ray, 10 of them only by ultrasonography, and 25 of them by both ultrasonography and X-ray. Pneumothorax was determined in 20 % (n= 12) of <b>the</b> <b>cases.</b> Excluding one case determined by both methods, all of <b>the</b> 11 <b>cases</b> were diagnosed by X-ray. Pleural effusion was diagnosed in 26 % (n= 16) of <b>the</b> <b>cases.</b> Four of <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> were demonstrated solely by ultrasonography, three of them solely by X-ray, and nine of <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> by both methods. Pericardial effusion was demonstrated in 10 % (n= 6) of <b>the</b> <b>cases.</b> Except for one of <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> determined by both methods, five of <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> were diagnosed by ultrasonography. There was a moderate correlation when all pathologies evaluated together (k= 0. 51). Conclusion: Thoracic ultrasonography might be a beneficial non-invasive method to evaluate postoperative respiratory problems in newborns who had congenital cardiac surgery...|$|R
