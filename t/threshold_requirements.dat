However, several states have <b>threshold</b> <b>requirements</b> for parties to obtain automatic ballot access to the next general election without having to submit voter-signed petitions. The <b>threshold</b> <b>requirements</b> have no practical bearing on the two main political parties (the Republican and Democratic parties) as they easily meet the requirements, but have come into play for minor parties such as the Green and Libertarian parties.

40|$|In recent years, ad bellum {{rules have}} been {{interpreted}} more leniently {{so as to}} permit forcible responses to terrorism. Yet the threshold level for an “armed attack” that legitimizes full-scale war in response has remained relatively high. This observation is especially puzzling insofar as customary international law reflects the practice of (strong) states, which, as we show, can benefit from credibly committing to lowering their tolerance towards terror attacks. Why is the <b>threshold</b> <b>requirement</b> relatively tolerant? What would be the critical mass of terror beyond which a full-scale war is legitimate? Under what circumstances are states expected to violate the ad bellum <b>threshold</b> <b>requirement?</b> This Article seeks compelling {{answers to these questions}} using game theory. We argue that a low ad bellum <b>threshold</b> <b>requirement</b> (an “intolerant strategy”) is a futile measure to fight terrorism, since normally it cannot underlie a renegotiation-proof equilibrium. Namely, were a strong state to seriously consider waging a full-scale war in response to repeated, low-level terror attacks sponsored by a weak state, both parties would be better off renegotiating their way back to the status quo ante. On the other hand, renegotiation may fail if transaction costs are high enough, which ultimately makes the intolerant strategy sustainable and the equilibrium level of terror lower. The overall conclusion is thus counterintuitive: an effective intolerant strategy in the War on Terror is beneficial for victim states, but implausible unless the barriers towards a nonviolent arrangement are sufficiently high...|$|R

Second, the country must be sufficiently poor to qualify for loans from the World Bank's International Development Association or the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF, the successor to ESAF), which provide long-term, interest-free loans to the world's poorest nations. Lastly, the country must establish a track record of reforms to help prevent future debt crises.|$|E

[...] Representation in a second-class township is by a board of supervisors elected at-large for 6 year terms.
