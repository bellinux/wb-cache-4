5|$|Eventually, {{at a time}} {{known as}} recombination, {{electrons}} and nuclei formed stable atoms, which are transparent to most wavelengths of radiation. With photons decoupled from matter, <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> entered the matter-dominated era.

After around 100 million years, the first stars formed; these were likely very massive, luminous, and responsible for the reionization of <b>the</b> <b>Universe.</b> Having no elements heavier than lithium, these stars also produced the first heavy elements through stellar nucleosynthesis. <b>The</b> <b>Universe</b> also contains a mysterious energy called dark energy, the density of which does not change over time. After about 9.8 billion years, <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> had expanded sufficiently so that the density of matter was less than the density of dark energy, marking the beginning of the present dark-energy-dominated era. In this era, the expansion of <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> is accelerating due to dark energy.|$|E
5|$|Further {{observational}} improvements led to {{the realization}} that our Solar System is located in the Milky Way galaxy, which is one of many galaxies in <b>the</b> <b>Universe.</b> It is assumed that galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> has neither an edge nor a center.

5|$|The Big Bang {{theory is}} the {{prevailing}} cosmological model for <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> {{from the earliest}} known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes how <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> expanded from a very high density and high temperature state, and offers a comprehensive explanation for {{a broad range of}} phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), large scale structure and Hubble's law. If the known laws of physics are extrapolated to the highest density regime, the result is a singularity which is typically associated with the Big Bang. Physicists are undecided whether this means <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> began from a singularity, or that current knowledge is insufficient to describe <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> at that time. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> place the Big Bang at around 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> After the initial expansion, <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later simple atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity in halos of dark matter, eventually forming the stars and galaxies visible today.|$|E

5|$|The {{ultimate}} fate of <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> {{is still}} unknown, because it depends critically on the curvature index k and the cosmological constant Λ.

Conversely, if <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> were insufficiently dense, k would equal 0 or −1 and <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> would expand forever, cooling off and eventually reaching the Big Freeze and the heat death of <b>the</b> <b>Universe.</b> Modern data suggests {{that the rate of}} expansion of <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> is not decreasing, as originally expected, but increasing; if this continues indefinitely, <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> may eventually reach a Big Rip.

5|$|According to the Big Bang theory, <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> {{originated}} {{in an extremely}} hot and dense state about 13.8 billion years ago and began expanding rapidly. About 380,000 years later <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen—the so-called recombination epoch. When this happened, matter and energy became decoupled, allowing photons to travel freely through space. The matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects, leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms {{what is now called}} outer space. As light has a finite velocity, this theory also constrains the size of the directly observable universe. This leaves open the question as to whether <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> is finite or infinite.|$|E
5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble {{observed that}} the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their redshifts. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction. Assuming the Copernican principle (that the Earth is not the center of <b>the</b> <b>universe),</b> the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> are receding from all others. Since {{we know that the}} distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together.
