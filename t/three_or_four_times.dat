5|$|Like the spinner shark, the blacktip shark {{is known}} to leap {{out of the water}} and spin <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> about its axis before landing. Some of these jumps are the end product of feeding runs, in which the shark corkscrews {{vertically}} through schools of small fish and its momentum launches it into the air. Observations in the Bahamas suggest that blacktip sharks may also jump out of the water to dislodge attached sharksuckers (Echeneis naucrates), which irritate the shark's skin and compromise its hydrodynamic shape. The speed attained by the shark during these jumps has been estimated to average 6.3m/s (21ft/s).|$|E
5|$|In 1828, Heliade {{published}} his first work, {{an essay on}} Romanian grammar, in the Transylvanian city of Hermannstadt (which {{was part of the}} Austrian Empire at the time), and, on April 20, 1829, began printing the Bucharest-based paper Curierul Românesc. This was the most successful of several attempts to create a local newspaper, something Golescu first attempted in 1828. Publishing articles in both Romanian and French, Curierul Românesc had, starting in 1836, its own literary supplement, under the title of Curier de Ambe Sexe; in print until 1847, it notably published one of Heliade's most famous poems, Zburătorul. Curierul Românesc was edited as a weekly, and later as a bimonthly, until 1839, when it began to be issued <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> a week.

30|$|This {{pattern of}} the {{relative}} concentrations being largely determined by the differences in reaction rates is still clearly visible after two time units (no transfer steps) as well, although with a lower variance in concentrations (9.84, or 4.6 % of the highest concentration).

According to this system architecture, the MSs are served by a dense network of fixed relay nodes (RNs) fed by a small number of large hub base stations (HBSs). In such deployment, high spectral efficiencies can be achieved if the RNs act as two-way relays; however this gives rise to co-channel interference (CCI) which needs to be mitigated. In order to gain insights on the impact of CCI to this scenario we consider an HBS with two highly directional antennas communicating with two MSs via two interfering two-way RNs. We investigate the average maximum sum-rate of a cooperative strategy based on Decode-and-Forward (DF) with network coding and a strategy based on Amplify-and-Forward (AF) with Network MIMO. Furthermore we devise some cooperative protocols that utilise two, <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>time</b> slots. It is shown that the 2 -slot schemes perform generally better and that the DF strategy achieves superior performance when CCI is low while AF with Network MIMO is superior when CCI is high.
