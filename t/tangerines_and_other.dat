40|$|The citrus {{industry}} {{has led the}} agricultural economy {{of the state of}} Florida to prosperity. Florida has historically been the largest citrus producing state in the USA. Citrus fruits such as oranges, grapefruit, tangelos, navels, limes, <b>tangerines</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> specialty fruits are the chief crops of the state. The remarkable growth of the state economy has been largely based on the various citrus related industries. This situation has brought job opportunity for many people and important potential for the economic growth of the state. To maintain the prosperity of citrus industry, Florida has been concerned about disease control, and natural disaster prevention. During the recent past, citrus greening and citrus canker have become serious threats to citrus in Florida. These diseases can result in tree decline, death, yield loss and lost marketability. Likewise, the farmers are concerned about huge costs from profit loss, tree loss, scouting, and chemicals used in an attempt to control the disease. An automated detection system may help in citrus greening and citrus canker prevention and, thus reduce the serious loss to the Florida citrus industry. This thesis considers the development of disease detection approaches for these diseases (citrus greening and citrus canker), when found in the presence of various other citrus diseases. The detection approach consists of these major sub-systems, namely, image acquisition, image processing and pattern recognition. The image acquisition system consists of digital camera (standard lens on a microscope), frame grabber with high pixels embedded in the computer and supplemental lighting. The imaging processing sub-system includes image preprocessing for background noise removal, leaf boundary detection and image feature extraction. Pattern recognition approaches were used to classify samples among several different conditions on fruit for canker and leaves for greening. The canker-based detection studies were conducted on grapefruit samples collected during the 2006 - 2007 harvest season. Fruit samples exhibiting canker and other topical peel condition were collected and RGB images were taken of the various conditions. Color texture features were extracted and discriminant analysis was used to classify grapefruit according to peel condition achieving overall accuracies of 96. 5 %. The citrus greening-based detection studies were conducted on orange leaf samples collected during the spring of 2008. Leaf samples taken from the tree in an orange orchard exhibiting greening and other common leaf condition were collected and microscopic RGB images were taken. Color texture features were extracted at various levels of magnification and preliminary results demonstrated that 5 X magnification was optimal. In order to evaluate the classification approaches, results were compared between classification methods for the citrus greening. Results demonstrated classification accuracy for citrus greening as high as 97. 00 %. Thus, this research mainly focused on demonstrating feasibility of citrus disease detection from visible symptoms on the fruit or leaf. These were offline approaches, not directly applicable to real-time technologies such as robotics and automated vehicles for agricultural application. However, they are a first step in demonstrating the potential for automated detection...|$|E

50|$|Throughout UCR's history, {{researchers}} have developed more than 40 new citrus varieties and invented new techniques {{to help the}} $960 million-a-year California citrus industry fight pests and diseases. In 1927, entomologists at the CES introduced two wasps from Australia as natural enemies of a major citrus pest, the citrophilus mealybug, saving growers in Orange County $1 million in annual losses. This event was pivotal in establishing biological control as a practical means of reducing pest populations. In 1963, plant physiologist Charles Coggins proved that application of gibberellic acid allows fruit to remain on citrus trees for extended periods. The ultimate result of his work, which continued through the 1980s, was {{the extension of the}} citrus-growing season in California from four to nine months. In 1980, UC Riverside released the Oroblanco grapefruit, its first patented citrus variety. Since then, the citrus breeding program has released other varieties such as the Melogold grapefruit, the Gold Nugget mandarin (or <b>tangerine),</b> <b>and</b> <b>others</b> that have yet to be given trademark names. To assist entrepreneurs in developing new products, UCR is a primary partner in the Riverside Regional Technology Park, which includes the City of Riverside and the County of Riverside. It also administers six reserves of the University of California Natural Reserve System. UCR recently announced a partnership with China Agricultural University to launch a new center in Beijing, which will study ways to respond to the country's growing environmental issues. UCR can also boast the birthplace of two name reactions in organic chemistry, the Castro-Stephens coupling and the Midland Alpine Borane Reduction.|$|R

30|$|Asian {{cultivated}} rice (O. sativa L.) {{is generally}} considered to have been domesticated from Oryza rufipogon several {{thousands of years ago}} (Cheng et al. 2003; Huang et al. 2012; Khush 1997; Oka 1988). However, there has been some debate regarding the origin of cultivated rice over the past several years, which centered on whether the two major rice cultivars, O. sativa L. ssp. indica and japonica, were derived from a single ancestor or were domesticated independently at different locations (Jin et al. 2008; Kawakami et al. 2007; Li et al. 2006; Molina et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2009; Zhu et al. 2011; Huang et al. 2012; Xu et al. 2012; Zhu and Ge 2005). While, African cultivated rice (O. glaberrima), which was thought to be domesticated from the wild progenitor O. barthii ~ 3000 years ago, had been demonstrated to be domesticated in a single region along the Niger river with independent and distinct process in regard to Asian cultivated rice (Wang et al. 2014). A closer evolutionary relationship between indica and aus strains were observed using both nuclear and chloroplast genome data, as well as among the tropical japonica, temperate japonica, and aromatic groups (Garris et al. 2005). The indica subpopulation was shown to contain the highest degree of chloroplast diversity (Garris et al. 2005). Kim et al. (2014) evaluated 67 improved varieties and 13 landraces from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) at both nuclear and chloroplast levels, and they found a temperate japonica subgroup that was less diverse than the indica ancestor group at the nuclear level but more diverse at the chloroplast level (Kim et al. 2014). Whole chloroplast genome phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Oryza nivara is closed to O. sativa L. spp. indica and the O. sativa L. spp. japonica is closed to Oryza rufipogon in Asian cultivated and wild rice (Brozynska et al. 2014) and the African rice (Oryza glaberrima and Oryza barthii) were cluster together but in separate group with the Asian rice (Wambugu et al. 2015). Our previous studies indicated that the use of chloroplast genome variation to study diversity, population genetics, and phylogenetic analysis was quite convincing and also supported some previous outcomes (Tong et al. 2015). Despite these chloroplast-related studies, a large number of accessions must be applied to extend these studies from limited collections and specific varieties. In addition to rice, chloroplast genome-dependent phylogenetic analyses have also been performed in apple, <b>tangerine,</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> species. (Nikiforova et al. 2013; Carbonell-Caballero et al. 2015).|$|R
