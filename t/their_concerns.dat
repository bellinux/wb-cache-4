5|$|BSkyB's {{continued}} {{partnership with}} the Premier League {{has led to an}} increase in the value of broadcasting rights and matches televised. Managers however have voiced <b>their</b> <b>concerns</b> about the latter and the excessive cost of live rights is partly a reason why top-flight football has not returned to the BBC or ITV. In 2005 BSkyB's monopoly on live rights ended after the European Commission ruled that the Premier League needed to have more than one holder.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, a {{delegation}} of Supreme Council officers met with President Calvin Coolidge to share with him <b>their</b> <b>concerns</b> about the persecution of Catholics in Mexico during its revolution, which had considered the Church part of a corrupt establishment to be overthrown. The Order subsequently launched a $1 million campaign to educate Americans about the attacks on Catholics and the Church in the Cristero War. Twenty-five martyrs from the conflict would eventually be canonized, including six knights.|$|E

5|$|Many {{wind power}} {{companies}} work with local communities to reduce environmental and other concerns associated with particular wind farms. In other cases there is direct community ownership of wind farm projects. Appropriate government consultation, planning and approval procedures {{also help to}} minimize environmental risks. Some may still object to wind farms but, according to The Australia Institute, <b>their</b> <b>concerns</b> should be weighed against the {{need to address the}} threats posed by climate change and the opinions of the broader community.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the first}} {{plans for a new}} Interstate Highway freeway, {{bypassing}} I-405, surfaced in 1968. The first proposal was to create a new highway between I-405 and the west banks of Lake Sammamish. Residents however forced the highway to the east banks of the lake after voicing <b>their</b> <b>concerns.</b> Residents {{on the east side of}} the lake voiced similar concerns and the plan was later dropped.|$|E

5|$|The {{aftermath}} of the crash had long-reaching repercussions in the rail industry. In 2015, at the 15th anniversary of the accident, the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) said a new system for handling maintenance introduced by Network Rail was confusing, {{and there was the}} potential for a similar accident to re-occur. The union's general secretary said that Network Rail needed to act on <b>their</b> <b>concerns,</b> otherwise there would be industrial action.|$|E
5|$|This scheme {{can be seen}} as a {{mechanism}} for representation. First, MPs are chosen by the electorate to represent <b>their</b> <b>concerns</b> and needs in Parliament. Secondly, the Prime Minister, who is vested with the confidence of majority of the MPs, and the Cabinet which is made up of popularly elected MPs, effectively represent the views of the electorate as he heads the Government. The structure of the executive is therefore based on the concept of political representation.|$|E
5|$|After taking office, Booker voluntarily reduced his own salary twice, {{reducing}} {{his salary}} by 8% {{early in his}} first year as mayor. He also raised the salaries of many city workers. However, his administration imposed one-day-a-month furloughs for all non-uniformed employees from July through December 2010, as well as 2% pay cuts for managers and directors earning more than $100,000 a year. In 2008 and 2009 the City of Newark received the Government Finance Officers Association's Distinguished Budget Presentation Award. In an effort to make government more accessible, Booker held regular open office hours during which city residents can meet with him personally to discuss <b>their</b> <b>concerns.</b> In 2010, Booker was among the finalists for the World Mayor prize, ultimately placing seventh. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the 2012 award.|$|E

5|$|Because of <b>their</b> <b>concerns,</b> Aflaq kept quiet. But to his astonishment, keeping quiet {{caused him}} to lose his post as Secretary General – Aflaq was succeeded as Secretary General of the National Command by Munif al-Razzaz, a Jordanian of Syrian origin. However, the power between the two camps was {{unexpectedly}} reshuffled when Amin al-Hafiz defected to Aflaq's camp. In contrast to other military officers al-Hafiz had very little influence within or outside the party. Al-Hafiz's defection led to a resurgence of activity within Aflaq's faction, al-Bitar and Umran were brought back from Spain {{to form a new}} government.|$|E
5|$|Critics of {{the system}} suggest that rules {{for the use of}} DRS have created an {{inconsistency}} of approach to lbw decisions depending on the circumstances of the referral. Opponents also doubt that the ball-tracking technology used in deciding lbws is reliable enough, but the ICC state that tests have shown the system to be 100% accurate. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have consistently declined to use DRS in matches involving India owing to <b>their</b> <b>concerns</b> regarding the ball-tracking technology. Early DRS trials were conducted during India matches, and several problems arose over lbws, particularly as the equipment was not as advanced as it later became. The BCCI believe the technology is unreliable and open to manipulation.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{social impact}} of {{television}} in Croatia {{is considered to}} be imperfect and that of variable quality, television is important in the society because it offers a way for non-governmental organizations to communicate <b>their</b> <b>concerns</b> to the public and to criticize the government and other aspects of politics of Croatia.

5|$|Galland {{was summoned}} to Karinhall on 18 August 1940, and missed the intense air battle that day, known as The Hardest Day. During the meeting, Göring insisted that, in combat, Bf 109 fighters escort Bf 110s, which could not survive against {{single-engine}} fighters. As high-scoring aces, both Galland and Mölders shared <b>their</b> <b>concerns</b> that close escort of Bf 110s and bombers robbed fighter pilots of their freedom to roam and engage the enemy on their own terms. They also pointed {{to the fact that}} German bombers flew at medium altitudes and low speed, the best height area and speed for the manoeuvrability of the Spitfire. Galland resented his pilots having to carry out a task unsuited to their equipment but Göring would not move from his position.|$|E

On 17 February, the board voluntarily appointed receivers from accountants Ernst & Young to take over management of the company. Their statement stressed that no winding-up petition had been issued and the company was not in liquidation.|$|E

5|$|In July 1998, Deconstruction and Mushroom {{confirmed}} {{the release of}} two remix albums entitled Mixes and Impossible Remixes respectively. Deconstruction said the Mixes album would be released as a triple-vinyl set and set the release date for the following year. However, fans voiced <b>their</b> <b>concerns</b> on expensive import prices for global shipping and with increasingly popular demand, Deconstruction scrapped the idea and released the remixes on a two-set compact disc, and forward the triple vinyl at a later date. This allowed Deconstruction to release the album earlier and Mixes was released on 3 August 1998 in the UK. Mushroom released Impossible Remixes on 8 July 1998, but initial pressings were on sale two months earlier.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell and Galle sent an {{anonymous}} complaint to the TMB detailing <b>their</b> <b>concerns</b> with Arafiles's care of nine patients in 2008 and 2009. The letter {{said that the}} nurses feared losing their jobs if their identities were revealed {{in connection with the}} complaint. Arafiles became aware of the complaint and spoke to Winkler County Sheriff Robert Roberts, alleging that the complaint amounted to harassment. The TMB issued a copy of the complaint to Roberts with the understanding that it would only be used to investigate criminal activity by Arafiles. Roberts sent the complaint to Arafiles and to WCMH administrator Stan Wiley. As WCMH was a small hospital, details from the letter identified Mitchell and Galle as the sources of the complaint.|$|E

In 1970, a commission in Mississippi voted to exclude the show from its state educational TV programming.
