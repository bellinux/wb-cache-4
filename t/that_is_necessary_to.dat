25|$|Short-term memory (STM) can be {{described}} as a system allowing one to temporarily store and manage information <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> complete complex cognitive tasks. Tasks which employ short-term memory include learning, reasoning, and comprehension. Spatial memory is a cognitive process that enables a person to remember different locations as well as spatial relations between objects. This allows one to remember where an object is in relation to another object; for instance, allowing someone to navigate through a familiar city. Spatial memories are said to form after a person has already gathered and processed sensory information about her or his environment.|$|E

To show that a system S is required to prove a theorem T, two proofs are required. The first proof shows T is provable from S; this is an ordinary mathematical proof along with a justification that it can be carried out in the system S. The second proof, known as a reversal, shows that T itself implies S; this proof is carried out in the base system. The reversal establishes that no axiom system S that extends the base system can be weaker than S while still provingT.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{synopsis of}} the film {{was published in the}} Moving Picture World as follows: [...] "Professor Dix has won fame as a scientist and has collected many objects of Egyptian ware, centuries old, that arouse the enthusiasm of his associates. Even Jack Thornton, an active, go-ahead young businessman, is interested in the professor's home, but although he tries to pretend it is Egyptology which interests him, the professor's fair young daughter is really the lodestone. Jack decides to win the old man's respect by posing as an Egyptologist himself. To start his collection, he purchases a mummy at an auction sale, and takes it home expecting that later he can make a great hit with his sweetheart's father, by presenting it to him as a gift. While the mummy is in Jack's room, a live electric wire is by accident brought in contact with it. The body has been so perfectly mummified, that the electric current is all <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> ignite the vital spark, and Jack is amazed to see dancing forth from the case which he thought contained only unattractive rags and bones, a beautiful Egyptian princess. As soon as she is released, the mummy makes violent love to Jack, and causes his sweetheart to quarrel with him (for how can a plain businessman explain the presence in his room of a beautiful barbarian?). When her love is spurned, the visitor from the distant past avenges herself by having Jack made into a mummy and placed in the case in her stead. Her heart relents, however, in time to save him from being 'cut up' by the professor, who with the sharp knife, starts to investigate the contents of the mummy case. But all ends happily when Jack's plain statements of the seemingly impossible facts are proved true by the professor. Jack is reunited to his sweetheart, and the professor, being a widower, also an ardent admirer of everything antique, leads the recreated Egyptian lady to the altar, {{in spite of the fact}} that there is a difference of several thousand years in their ages." ...|$|E

2500|$|Psychopathy {{has often}} been {{considered}} untreatable. Its unique characteristics makes it among the most [...] of personality disorders, a class of mental illnesses that are already traditionally considered difficult to treat. People afflicted with psychopathy are generally unmotivated to seek treatment for their condition, and can be uncooperative in therapy. Attempts to treat psychopathy with the current tools available to psychiatry have been disappointing. Harris and Rice's Handbook of Psychopathy says that there is currently little evidence for a cure or effective treatment for psychopathy; as of yet, no pharmacological therapies are known to or have been trialed for alleviating the emotional, interpersonal and moral deficits of psychopathy, and patients with psychopathy who undergo psychotherapy might gain the skills to become more adept at the manipulation and deception of others and {{be more likely to}} commit crime. Some studies suggest that punishment and behavior modification techniques are ineffective at modifying the behavior of psychopathic individuals as they are insensitive to punishment or threat. These failures have led to a widely pessimistic view on its treatment prospects, a view that is exacerbated by the little research being done into this disorder compared to the efforts committed to other mental illnesses, which makes it more difficult to gain the understanding of this condition <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> develop effective therapies.|$|E

2500|$|Climate plays a {{major role}} in the moose-wolf {{relationship}} as well. Since El Niño hit in 1998, the climate has warmed up, which has significantly affected the moose population across North America. [...] The warmer climate in recent years has produced more Moose winter ticks, which consume the blood of animals, making them more susceptible to anemia, and induce the moose to scratch off their hair, exposing them to hypothermia in cold weather. [...] A moose can have tens of thousands of ticks feeding on its blood at one time, each sucking up to one milliliter of blood. The biting ticks cause a lot of discomfort for the moose, so they try to get the ticks off their bodies by biting off their hair, and rubbing up against trees. This preoccupies moose, and keeps them from browsing for food, which can lead to malnutrition. Compounded with blood loss, moose weakened by ticks are easier for wolves to kill. [...] Ticks are more prominent in years where spring arrives earlier than usual, because when they fall on ground not covered in snow, then they can reproduce. Otherwise, they die out. [...] Then, if the summer is hot, ticks are able to reproduce at a higher rate. Hot summers also lead to moose resting in the shade, or in the water to keep cool, making them easier prey for wolves. Also, hot summers lead to tougher foraging for moose which makes them less prepared and more vulnerable to the winter. Not only has the recent warming of Isle Royale hurt the moose, but completely opposite problems harm them also. Harsh winters pose significant problems to moose, because moose have problems finding food when there is too much snow on the ground. [...] The less snow there is, the more freely moose can move around the island. When there is a significant amount of snow, moose stay in conifer swamps, making them easier prey for wolves, because they are more confined, and immobilized due to the snow. [...] Deep or heavy snow decreases the speed and agility of moose <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> evade wolf attacks, and calves born during a winter with particularly deep snow are more vulnerable to being weaker prey for wolves later on in their lives because of foraging problems that occur when the snow is deep.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film has}} been both criticized and praised for its {{handling}} of subject matter, including the portrayal of harsh interrogation techniques, commonly classified as torture. The use of these techniques was long kept secret by the Bush administration. (See Torture Memos.) Glenn Greenwald, in The Guardian, stated that the film takes a pro-torture stance, describing it as [...] "pernicious propaganda" [...] and stating that it [...] "presents torture as its CIA proponents and administrators see it: as a dirty, ugly business <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> protect America." [...] Critic Frank Bruni concluded that the film appears to suggest [...] "No waterboarding, no Bin Laden". Jesse David Fox writes that the film [...] "doesn't explicitly say that torture caught bin Laden, but in portraying torture as {{one part of the}} successful search, it can be read that way." [...] Emily Bazelon said, [...] "The filmmakers didn't set out to be Bush-Cheney apologists", but [...] "they adopted a close-to-the-ground point of view, and perhaps they're in denial about how far down the path to condoning torture this led them." [...] Journalist Michael Wolff slammed the film as a [...] "nasty piece of pulp and propaganda" [...] and Bigelow as a [...] "fetishist and sadist" [...] for distorting history with a pro-torture viewpoint. Wolff disputed the efficacy of torture and the claim that it contributed to the discovery of bin Laden. In an open letter, social critic and feminist Naomi Wolf criticized Bigelow for claiming the film was [...] "part documentary" [...] and speculated over the reasons for Bigelow's [...] "amoral compromising" [...] of film-making, suggesting that the more pro-military a film, the easier it is to acquire Pentagon support for scenes involving expensive, futuristic military equipment. Wolf likened Bigelow to the acclaimed director and propagandist for the Nazi regime, Leni Riefenstahl, saying: [...] "Like Riefenstahl, you are a great artist. But now you will be remembered forever as torture's handmaiden." [...] Author Karen J. Greenberg wrote that [...] "Bigelow has bought in, hook, line, and sinker, to the ethos of the Bush administration and its apologists" [...] and called the film [...] "the perfect piece of propaganda, with all the appeal that naked brutality, fear, and revenge can bring". Peter Maass of The Atlantic said the film [...] "represents a troubling new frontier of government-embedded filmmaking".|$|E
