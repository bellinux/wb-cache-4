40|$|The {{waves of}} the worst global {{financial}} and economic crisis since World War II have seriously affected {{the economy of the}} Euro Area. The first wave of the global crisis determined the worst recession in decades for the member states of the region. At present, the Monetary Union is confronted with the second wave of the crisis â€“ the public debt problem. Despite the efforts adopted and implemented by the European policymakers over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>quarters,</b> <b>the</b> sovereign debt crisis is far from over. Spain has recently become the â€œfavourite targetâ€ of the financial markets. Among the consequences of the {{waves of the}} crisis for the Euro Area one can mention the potential output decline and the economic divergence (asymmetric evolution of member countries). In this context, the potential output recovery and the relaunch of the real economic convergence process represent the main challenges for the policymakers in the medium run. This paper analyses the evolution of potential GDP of the member countries of European Monetary Union (12). I employ the Hodrick-Prescott methodology on data from the World Bank Database. According to the results, the economic potential of the member states of the Euro Area (12) decreased to the lowest level of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> decades. At <b>the</b> same time, the analysis presents the differences exiting across the member states in terms of potential output. Some countries suffered an important potential output loss over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>quarters</b> (it seems that Greece and Portugal have become asymmetric shocks in the Monetary Union). For these countries, the first wave of the global crisis transformed in a permanent shock. The decline of investments and the depreciation of human capital over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>quarters</b> express a huge probability that potential output is going to maintain at a low level in the Euro Area over the following years. The recovery of potential GDP towards the pre-crisis levels is dependent on a higher participation rate of active population, strong reforms of labour markets and, importantly, the return of investment flows. Other measures in order to attain the objectives of Europe 2020 (smart, sustainable and inclusive growth) would also help the process of potential GDP recovery in Europe...|$|R

40|$|Why has Swiss export {{performance}} been so strong during <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>quarters</b> despite <b>the</b> strong {{appreciation of the}} CHF? In this paper, we use historical data on exchange rates and trade at the sectoral level to document that a contributing factor behind the limited impact of the exchange rate is the unique composition of Swiss exports. In particular, we document that the Swiss export basket is heavily concentrated in price-insensitive goods such as machinery or pharmaceuticals, where prices and thus the exchange rate have relatively little importance for demand. This makes the aggregate volume of Swiss exports less responsive to exchange rate changes than exports of other OECD nations. International trade; International economic relations...|$|R

500|$|George Orwell {{believed}} {{just the}} opposite. He argued: [...] "It {{is clear that}} something has departed, some kind of current has been switched off, the later verse does not contain the earlier, {{even if it is}} claimed as an improvement upon it [...] He does not really feel his faith, but merely assents to it for complex reasons. It does not in itself give him any fresh literary impulse." [...] Years later, Russell Kirk wrote, [...] "I cannot agree with Orwell that Eliot gave no more than a melancholy assent to doctrines now quite unbelievable. Over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>quarter</b> of a century, most serious critics—whether or not they find Christian faith impossible—have found in the Quartets the greatest twentieth-century achievements in the poetry of philosophy and religion." [...] Like Orwell, Stead also noticed a difference between the Four Quartets and Eliot's earlier poetry, but he disagreed with Orwell's conclusion: [...] "Four Quartets is an attempt to bring into a more exact balance the will and the creative imagination; it attempts to harness the creative imagination which in all Eliot's earlier poetry ran its own course, edited but not consciously directed. The achievement is of a high order, but the best qualities of Four Quartets are inevitably different from those of The Waste Land.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{mathematical}} {{studies in}} ecology {{in the nineteenth}} century assumed a uniform distribution of living organisms in their habitat. In <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>quarter</b> century, ecologists have begun to recognize the degree to which organisms respond to spatial patterns in their environment. Due to the rapid advances in computer technology in the same time period, more advanced methods of statistical data analysis have come into use. Also, the repeated use of remotely sensed imagery and geographic information systems in a particular area has led to increased analysis and identification of spatial patterns over time. [...] These technologies have also increased the ability to determine how human activities have impacted animal habitat and climate change. The natural world has become increasingly fragmented due to human activities; anthropogenic landscape change has had a ripple-effect impacts on wildlife populations, which are now more likely to be small, restricted in distribution, and increasingly isolated from one another. In part as a reaction to this knowledge, and partially due to increasingly sophisticated theoretical developments, ecologists began stressing the importance of spatial context in research. Spatial ecology emerged from this movement toward spatial accountability; [...] "the progressive introduction of spatial variation and complexity into ecological analysis, including changes in spatial patterns over time".|$|E
