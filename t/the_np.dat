5|$|Amtrak's {{decision}} to discontinue <b>the</b> <b>NP</b> trains caused consternation in Montana. Mike Mansfield (D-Montana), then Senate Majority Leader, {{pointed out that}} the Empire Builder bypassed Montana's major population centers, and had no difficulty in making his displeasure felt. The new company reacted to the pressure and announced a resumption of service over the ex-Northern Pacific, to begin on June 14. This service took the form of an unnamed section of the Empire Builder running separately between Minneapolis and Spokane, Washington. Mansfield's intervention earned the train the nickname “Mike Mansfield Limited”. The Northern Pacific route, which included the Yellowstone River, Homestake Pass and Bitterroot Mountains, was praised for its scenery. Amtrak considered the route one of the company's six most beautiful. The train also provided a convenient connection to Yellowstone National Park at Livingston, Montana.|$|E

5|$|The {{flagship}} {{train on}} the Northern Pacific Railway ("NP") main line was the North Coast Limited, which had begun running in 1900. Its running mate since 1952 was the Mainstreeter, which operated on a slower schedule with fewer amenities. The Northern Pacific main line mirrored {{that of its}} great rival, the Great Northern Railway ("GN"), running through southern Montana and North Dakota. Even after the merger of <b>the</b> <b>NP,</b> GN, and Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad ("CB") into the Burlington Northern Railroad in 1970, service continued on both the ex-Northern Pacific and ex-Great Northern. When passenger service was transferred to Amtrak, the new provider chose the Great Northern's Empire Builder as its Chicago–Pacific Northwest route. Amtrak based this decision on several factors, including the overall higher speed of the ex-Great Northern route and better availability of alternative transportation options along the ex-Northern Pacific.|$|E
40|$|Determination {{of surface}} and {{transport}} properties of nanoparticles (NPs) {{is essential for}} a variety of applications in enhanced oil and gas recoveries. In this paper, the impact of the surface chemistry of silica NPs on their hydro- and oleo-phobic properties as well as their transport properties are investigated in water or decane using molecular dynamics simulation. Trifluoromethyl or pentafluoroethyl groups as water and oil repellents are placed on <b>the</b> <b>NPs.</b> It is found that the density and residence time of liquid molecules around <b>the</b> <b>NPs</b> are modulated considerably with the existence of the functional groups on the NPs’ surfaces. Also, much larger density fluctuations for liquids close to the surface of <b>the</b> <b>NPs</b> are observed when the number of the groups on <b>the</b> <b>NPs</b> increases, indicating increased hydrophobicity. In addition, the diffusion coefficient of <b>the</b> <b>NPs</b> in either water or decane increases with increasing the number or length of the fluorocarbon chains, demonstrating non-Brownian behavior for <b>the</b> <b>NPs.</b> <b>The</b> surface chemistry imparts a considerable contribution on the diffusion coefficient of <b>the</b> <b>NPs.</b> Finally, potential of mean force calculations are undertaken.

40|$|Porous silicon {{nanoparticles}} (PSi NPs) {{have recently}} drawn increasing interest for therapeutic applications {{due to their}} easily modifiable surface, large pore volumes, high surface area, nontoxic nature, and high biocompatibility. Nevertheless, there is no comprehensive understanding {{about the role of}} the surface chemistry of these <b>NPs</b> on <b>the</b> biological interactions and the therapeutic effect of the PSi-based nanosystems. Therefore, extensive attempts are still needed for the development of optimal PSi-based therapeutics. The first step for evaluating the biological activity of <b>the</b> <b>NPs</b> was to investigate the potential toxic effects. Accordingly, the immunotoxicity and hemocompatibility of <b>the</b> PSi <b>NPs</b> with different surface chemistries were assessed at different concentrations on the immune cells and red blood cells, since these are the first biological cells in contact with <b>the</b> <b>NPs</b> after intravenous injection. PSi NPs with positively charged amine functional groups showed higher toxicity compared to negatively charged particles. The toxicity of the negatively charged particles was also highly dependent on the hydrophobic nature of <b>the</b> <b>NPs.</b> Moreover, RBC hemolysis and imaging assay revealed a significant correlation between <b>the</b> PSi <b>NP</b> surface chemistry and hemotoxicity. To further understand the impact of the surface chemistry on the immunological effects of <b>the</b> PSi <b>NPs,</b> <b>the</b> immunostimulatory responses induced by a non-toxic concentration of <b>the</b> PSi <b>NPs</b> were evaluated by measuring the maturation of dendritic cells, T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. Overall, the results suggested that all <b>the</b> PSi <b>NPs</b> containing higher amounts of nitrogen or oxygen on the outermost surface layer have lower immunostimulatory effects than <b>the</b> PSi <b>NPs</b> with higher amounts of C‒H structures on <b>the</b> <b>NPs</b> surface. Combination cancer therapy by <b>the</b> PSi <b>NPs</b> was then studied by evaluating the synergistic therapeutic effects of the nanosystems. Sorafenib-loaded PSi NPs were biofunctionalized with anti-CD 326 monoclonal antibody on their surface. <b>The</b> targeted PSi <b>NPs</b> showed a sustained drug release and increased interactions with the breast cancer cells expressing the CD 326 antigen on their surface. These NPs also showed higher antiproliferation effect on the CD 326 positive cancer cells compared to the pure drug and sorafenib-loaded PSi NPs, suggesting CD 326 as an appropriate receptor for the antibody-mediated drug delivery. In addition, anti-CD 326 antibody acted as an immunotherapeutic agent by inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and enhancing the interactions of immune cells with cancer cells for the subsequent phagocytosis and cytokine secretion. Next, the development of a stable PSi NP with low toxicity, high cellular internalization, efficient endosomal escape, and optimal drug release profile was tested by using a layer-by-layer method to covalently conjugate polyethyleneimine and poly(methyl vinyl ether-co-maleic acid) copolymers on the surface of <b>the</b> PSi <b>NPs,</b> forming a zwitterionic nanocomposite. The surface smoothness and hydrophilicity of <b>the</b> polymer functionalized <b>NPs</b> improved considerably <b>the</b> colloidal and plasma stability of <b>the</b> <b>NPs.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> double layer conjugation sustained the drug release from <b>the</b> PSi <b>NPs</b> and improved <b>the</b> cytotoxicity profile of <b>the</b> drug-loaded PSi <b>NPs.</b> In conclusion, this work showed that the surface modification of <b>the</b> PSi <b>NPs</b> with different chemical groups, antibodies and polymers can affect the toxicological profiles, the cellular interactions and the therapeutic effects of <b>the</b> <b>NPs</b> by modifying <b>the</b> charge, stability, hydrophilicity, the drug release kinetics and targeting properties of <b>the</b> PSi <b>NPs.</b> N...|$|R

40|$|Cancer is {{the second}} highest {{cause of death in}} the US, and {{chemotherapy}} is one of the common cancer therapies. In order to reduce side effects and avoid cancer’s resistance to antitumor drugs, we use nanoparticle (NP) -assisted chemotherapy. This strategy can selectively deliver high concentrations of antitumor drugs to the tumor area, because NPs can encapsulate antitumor drugs, target the tumor area by active and passive targeting mechanisms, and release the drugs inside the cancer cells. This work focuses on three aspects of such NPs: high loading with antitumor drugs, controlled release of antitumor drugs, and high cellular uptake by <b>the</b> <b>NPs.</b> As a model system, polyacrylamide-based NPs were loaded with cisplatin. The effects of functional groups in <b>the</b> <b>NPs,</b> and <b>the</b> effects of matrix densities, were evaluated in terms of the NPs’ drug-loading, their release profile, and their cellular uptake. <b>The</b> carboxyl-functionalized <b>NPs</b> achieved 2 times higher loading and faster release of cisplatin than <b>the</b> amine-functionalized <b>NPs.</b> In contrast, <b>the</b> amine-functionalized <b>NPs</b> had 3. 5 times better cellular uptake than <b>the</b> carboxyl-functionalized <b>NPs.</b> Tuning <b>the</b> matrix density of those <b>NPs</b> could control <b>the</b> release of cisplatin. Also, cisplatin-loaded, temperature-responsive NPs were synthesized so as to incorporate a trigger for cisplatin release in the cancer cells. The elevated temperature successfully enhanced the release of cisplatin from <b>the</b> synthesized <b>NPs,</b> especially under acidic conditions simulating lysosomes, which were the destination of <b>the</b> <b>NPs</b> inside <b>the</b> cells.

25|$|Adna Anderson (1827–1889), engineer-in-chief, February 18, 1880, to January 1888. In October 1886, he {{was also}} named second {{vice-president}} of the Northern Pacific. He completed the line between Saint Paul, Minnesota, and Wallula (where it connected with the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company’s line to Portland), witnessing the driving of the last spike on September 8, 1883. Thereafter, he evaluated possible routes for the Cascade Division, intended to connect <b>the</b> <b>NP</b> at some point {{near the mouth of}} the Snake River with Tacoma, Washington on Puget Sound. Preliminary reconnaissance and surveys began in March 1880, and in autumn, 1883, Anderson concluded that the line should be built through Stampede Pass.|$|E
40|$|Disc-shaped copper {{nanoparticles}} (Cu NPs) were fabricated by hole-mask colloidal lithography on {{bare and}} thin titania film covered fused silica substrates. The dynamics of Cu oxide formation around <b>the</b> <b>NPs</b> were studied in water by localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectroscopy. We {{found that the}} oxidation rate is strongly enhanced under UV irradiation when <b>the</b> <b>NPs</b> are on <b>the</b> surface of the titania film, in comparison to NPs deposited on an inert fused silica substrate. The reason is sought {{in the ability of}} TiO 2 to create hydroxyl radicals with strong oxidative potential in water under UV irradiation and the charge transfer at the interface between <b>the</b> Cu <b>NPs</b> and <b>the</b> TiO 2. The post irradiation analysis of the samples with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy provides complementary evidence for Cu oxide formation. In addition, size and shape changes of <b>the</b> <b>NPs,</b> as measured by atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, indicate (photo) corrosion of <b>the</b> <b>NPs.</b> Our results demonstrate the potential of using LSPR spectroscopy to monitor the oxidation of Cu NPs in situ and in different environments...|$|R
30|$|Photosensitizers, such as TiO 2 or ZnO NPs, can be {{delivered}} to the tumor cells {{as the result of}} passive or active processes [121]. The passive process takes advantage of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Leaky vasculature in the cancer tissue allows <b>the</b> <b>NPs</b> to be freely uptaken into the tumor cells, a phenomenon leading to the cell death. The uptake takes place also in the inflamed tissue; hence, the passive process does not provide for <b>the</b> targeted <b>NPs</b> delivery to <b>the</b> tumor cells [122]. In the active process, <b>the</b> functionalization of <b>NPs</b> occurs; therefore, <b>the</b> <b>NPs</b> can {{be delivered}} to tumor cells in a targeted manner. <b>The</b> functionalization of <b>NPs</b> means their conjugation with specific antibodies or ligands. PDT clearly lowers the cancer therapy side effects, compared to chemo- or radiotherapy [123]. The way the cellular uptake of nanoparticles takes place, their subcellular position and the ability to cause toxic effects depend mainly upon <b>the</b> <b>NPs</b> diameter, their surface area, surface chemistry, and charge [124]. There are two major ways of <b>the</b> <b>NPs</b> uptake into <b>the</b> cell: active uptake by endocytosis and passive uptake by diffusion. Due to their strong hydrophilic properties, both TiO 2 and ZnO NPs are uptaken into the cells by phagocytosis [125].|$|R
30|$|The loading {{efficiency}} of pDNA to <b>the</b> <b>NPs</b> was evaluated by measuring unbound pDNA in <b>the</b> <b>NPs</b> solution. <b>The</b> supernatant in the loaded docetaxel or free TPGS-b-(PCL-ran-PGA)/PEI NPs solution was recovered by removing <b>the</b> <b>NPs</b> by centrifugation. Free pDNA {{concentration in the}} supernatant was determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm using a UV- 2550 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). Loading {{efficiency of}} pDNA in NPs was determined by subtracting the amount of pDNA recovered in the washing solutions from initial amount of pDNA added. Encapsulation efficiency {{was defined as the}} percentage of pDNA encapsulated in NPs with respect to the initially added amount of pDNA.|$|R
