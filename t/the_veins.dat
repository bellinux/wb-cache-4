5|$|Each of {{the wings}} {{consists}} of a thin membrane supported by a system of veins. The membrane is formed by two layers of integument closely apposed, while <b>the</b> <b>veins</b> are formed where the two layers remain separate; sometimes the lower cuticle is thicker and more heavily sclerotized under a vein. Within each of the major veins there is a nerve and a trachea, and, since the cavities of <b>the</b> <b>veins</b> are connected with the hemocoel, hemolymph can flow into the wings.|$|E

50|$|The pterygoid plexus of <b>veins</b> becomes <b>the</b> maxillary <b>vein.</b> <b>The</b> maxillary <b>vein</b> and <b>the</b> {{superficial}} temporal <b>vein</b> later join {{to become}} <b>the</b> retromandibular <b>vein.</b> <b>The</b> posterior branch of <b>the</b> retromandibular <b>vein</b> and posterior auricular <b>vein</b> then form <b>the</b> external jugular <b>vein,</b> which empties into <b>the</b> subclavian <b>vein.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>veins</b> of the brain, {{both the}} {{superficial}} veins {{and the deep}} venous system, empty into the dural venous sinuses, which carry blood back to the jugular vein and thence to the heart. In cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, blood clots usually form both in <b>the</b> <b>veins</b> {{of the brain and}} the venous sinuses. The thrombosis of <b>the</b> <b>veins</b> themselves causes venous infarction—damage to brain tissue due to a congested and therefore insufficient blood supply. This results in cerebral edema (both vasogenic and cytotoxic edema), and leads to small petechial haemorrhages that may merge into large haematomas. Thrombosis of the sinuses is the main mechanism behind the increase in intracranial pressure due to decreased resorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The condition does not lead to hydrocephalus, however, because there is no difference in pressure between various parts of the brain.|$|E
5|$|Venous {{thrombosis}} {{may also}} occur in more unusual places: in <b>the</b> <b>veins</b> of the brain, liver (portal vein thrombosis and hepatic vein thrombosis), mesenteric vein, kidney (renal vein thrombosis) and <b>the</b> <b>veins</b> of the arms. Whether thrombophilia also {{increases the risk}} of arterial thrombosis (which is the underlying cause of heart attacks and strokes) is less well established.|$|E
5|$|Imaging {{tests of}} <b>the</b> <b>veins</b> {{are used in}} the {{diagnosis}} of DVT, most commonly either proximal compression ultrasound or whole-leg ultrasound. Each technique has drawbacks: a single proximal scan may miss a distal DVT, while whole-leg scanning can lead to distal DVT overtreatment. Doppler ultrasound, CT scan venography, MRI venography, or MRI of the thrombus are also possibilities.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{superior}} anastomotic <b>vein,</b> {{also known}} as <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> of Trolard, is a [...] superficial cerebral <b>vein</b> grouped with <b>the</b> superior cerebral <b>veins.</b> <b>The</b> <b>vein</b> was eponymously named after the 18th century anatomist Jean Baptiste Paulin Trolard. <b>The</b> <b>vein</b> anastomoses with <b>the</b> middle cerebral <b>vein</b> and <b>the</b> superior sagittal sinus.|$|R

5|$|Several viruses {{are known}} to infect the plant, {{including}} seed-borne strawberry latent ringspot virus, parsnip yellow fleck virus, parsnip leafcurl virus, parsnip mosaic potyvirus, and potyvirus celery mosaic virus.

50|$|<b>The</b> {{superior}} mesenteric <b>vein</b> and <b>the</b> splenic <b>vein</b> {{come together}} to form the actual hepatic portal <b>vein.</b> <b>The</b> inferior mesenteric <b>vein</b> connects in <b>the</b> majority of people on <b>the</b> splenic <b>vein,</b> but in some people, it is known to connect on <b>the</b> portal <b>vein</b> or <b>the</b> superior mesenteric <b>vein.</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose of {{this study}} was the {{assessment}} of the anatomo-pathological modifications of <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> after EndoVenous Laser Treatment(EVTL) and, consequently, to understand if possible <b>the</b> mechanism of <b>vein</b> occlusion. After an unsuccessful EVLT we performed a standard great saphenous vein (GSV) stripping and examined microscopically the stripped GSV. A circumferencial vein wall damage was never observed; the damage was limited to a relatively small portion of <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> wall (about one third of it) and it did not interest all the wall layers. In conclusion, a widespread damage of <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> wall seems to be necessary to obtain <b>vein</b> occlusion. About <b>the</b> most likely mechanism of occlusion after EVLT, thrombosis of <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> lumen or edema of <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> wall, no definitive conclusion can be drawn...|$|R

5|$|Tubular veins {{run through}} the two-layered {{membranous}} wing. Veins {{are connected to the}} haemocoel and in theory allow haemolymph to flow through them. In addition, a nerve and trachea may pass through <b>the</b> <b>veins.</b>|$|E
5|$|After they hatch, {{the small}} {{caterpillars}} only eat the tissue (parenchyma) between <b>the</b> <b>veins</b> of the leaves. They {{do this to}} avoid the sticky and toxic latex produced by the plant's laticifers and transported in <b>the</b> <b>veins.</b> After 3–4 days, the caterpillars also eat flowers, fruit, tendrils, petioles and young stems (as well as continuing to eat leaves), defoliating the entire plant. They are particularly fond of the glands {{at the base of}} the leaf, near the petiole. They can deal with the chemical defences in the latex, which does not cause the problem of mouthpart coagulation. The caterpillars spin silk from their mouth with an '∞' motion of the head as they walk, this keeps them from falling from the smooth surface of the leaves. The silk also permits them to climb back to the plant should they fall. Strong rain makes them fall despite the silk. There are four instars, and the caterpillar stage lasts from two months in the warm season to two and a half to three months in the cold season. The caterpillar is whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and is covered in club-ended black setae. It has five pairs of prolegs on segments 3 to 6 and 10, and six true legs attached to the thorax.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>vein</b> of Giacomini {{is often}} {{identified}} with the cranial extension of <b>the</b> small saphenous <b>vein</b> despite <b>the</b> fact that {{according to the international}} interdisciplinary anatomical nomenclature they are distinguished from one another. The objective of the research was to improve the results of treatment of patients with lower limb primary chronic venous disease disease studying the variation in anatomy and pathology of <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> of Giacomini and the cranial extension of <b>the</b> small saphenous <b>vein</b> with subsequent development of differential surgical tactics. Materials and methods. 502 patients with primary chronic venous disease on 605 legs were examined and treated. Each patient underwent preoperative ultrasonographic triplex scanning of the lower limb venous system. Results. Varicose dilatation of <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> of Giacomini was observed in 3. 8 % of patients (95 % CI 2. 4 - 5. 6 %), and the pathology of the cranial extension of <b>the</b> small saphenous <b>vein</b> was detected in 1. 7 % of patients (95 % CI 0. 8 - 3. 0 %). When the arch of <b>the</b> small saphenous <b>vein</b> was present <b>the</b> following variations in the pathology of <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> of Giacomini were observed: 1) the spread of reflux from <b>the</b> great saphenous <b>vein</b> to <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> of Giacomini; 2) reflux from the terminal valve of <b>the</b> small saphenous <b>vein</b> intensified <b>the</b> antegrade flow of blood within <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> of Giacomini resulting in reflux in <b>the</b> great saphenous <b>vein</b> distal to <b>the</b> point where <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> of Giacomini drained into <b>the</b> great saphenous <b>vein.</b> <b>The</b> causes of failure of the valves in the trunk of the cranial extension of <b>the</b> small saphenous <b>vein</b> included: 1) reflux from the ostium of the cranial extension of the small saphenous vein; 2) perforating vein reflux; 3) reflux from the terminal valve of <b>the</b> small saphenous <b>vein.</b> Conclusions.  The pathology of <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> of Giacomini and the cranial extension of <b>the</b> small saphenous <b>vein</b> is not homogeneous; therefore, surgical tactics in every patient has to be hemodynamically justified and differentiated depending on the pathways of pathological reflux spreading. ...|$|R
50|$|In most individuals, <b>the</b> portal <b>vein</b> {{is formed}} by the union of <b>the</b> {{superior}} mesenteric <b>vein</b> and <b>the</b> splenic <b>vein.</b> For this reason, <b>the</b> portal <b>vein</b> is occasionally called the splenic-mesenteric confluence. Occasionally, <b>the</b> portal <b>vein</b> also directly communicates with <b>the</b> inferior mesenteric <b>vein,</b> although this is highly variable. Other tributaries of <b>the</b> portal <b>vein</b> include <b>the</b> cystic and gastric veins.|$|R
2500|$|The argentiferous galena (lead sulphide, {{containing}} {{small amounts}} of silver), which the miners sought, occurred as ribs, strings and dispersed pockets throughout <b>the</b> <b>vein.</b> Many strings of galena, varying in thickness between 1/8 of an inch (2mm) and about , were interspersed through <b>the</b> <b>vein,</b> and sometimes spread into the rock {{on the east side}} of <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> (<b>the</b> hanging wall of the fault). The mineralised parts of <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> were mostly found in four areas, known as [...] "ore shoots." [...] Their position was determined by the steepness of the fault plane. In general, areas where the fault dipped at more than 70°, were mineralised, but where the dip was less than 70° <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> was barren, filled with the light coloured soft fault breccia which the miners called [...] "chunk." [...] The mineralised parts of <b>the</b> <b>vein,</b> at least in the lower part of the mine, had an average lead content of 7%.|$|R
5|$|As a first {{approximation}} {{only the}} inert gasses {{are taken into}} account. For oxygen partial pressures above 2.4 bar, the quantity of oxygen dissolved in the arterial blood exceeds the amount that the body can use, and the hemoglobin is saturated with oxygen in both <b>the</b> <b>veins</b> and the arteries. If more oxygen is added, the partial pressure of oxygen in the venous blood rises.|$|E
5|$|As {{the wing}} develops, the dorsal and ventral integumental layers become closely apposed {{over most of}} their area forming the wing membrane. The {{remaining}} areas form channels, the future veins, in which the nerves and tracheae may occur. The cuticle surrounding <b>the</b> <b>veins</b> becomes thickened and more heavily sclerotized to provide strength and rigidity to the wing. Two types of hair may occur on the wings: microtrichia, which are small and irregularly scattered, and macrotrichia, which are larger, socketed, and may be restricted to veins. The scales of Lepidoptera and Trichoptera are highly modified macrotrichia.|$|E
5|$|Attention will {{be focused}} on the {{direction}} of the blood flow in both of the venous systems, and in the perforator veins, as well as being focused on shunt detection. A shunting of blood from the thigh veins back into the lower leg veins will give a reflux situation. <b>The</b> <b>veins</b> most often found to be incompetent are the saphenous veins and the perforators communicating with the deep veins of the thigh.|$|E

5|$|Bats also {{possess a}} system of {{sphincter}} valves on the arterial side of the vascular network that runs {{along the edge of}} their wings. In the fully open state, these allow oxygenated blood to flow through the capillary network across the wing membrane, but when contracted, they shunt flow directly to <b>the</b> <b>veins,</b> bypassing the wing capillaries. This allows bats to control the amount of heat exchanged through the thin flight membrane, allowing them to release heat during flight. Many other mammals use the capillary network in oversized ears for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|Bats seem to {{make use}} of {{particularly}} strong venomotion, a rhythmic contraction of venous wall muscles. In most mammals, the walls of <b>the</b> <b>veins</b> provide mainly passive resistance, maintaining their shape as deoxygenated blood flows through them, but in bats they appear to actively support blood flow back to the heart with this pumping action. Due to their relatively small and lightweight bodies, bats are not at risk of blood flow rushing to their heads when roosting.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its high}} level of {{nutrient}} requirements, cabbage is prone to nutrient deficiencies, including boron, calcium, phosphorus and potassium. There are several physiological disorders that can affect the postharvest appearance of cabbage. Internal tip burn occurs when the margins of inside leaves turn brown, but the outer leaves look normal. Necrotic spot is where there are oval sunken spots a few millimeters across that are often grouped around the midrib.
