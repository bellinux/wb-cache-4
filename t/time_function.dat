40|$|This paper {{considers}} the ideal dynamic user optimal (DUO) route choice problem using a route-based variational inequality approach. A discrete time dynamic flow model is developed, which uses link travel <b>time</b> <b>functions</b> to determine time-dependent network states. The proposed flow model {{is built on}} discrete time flow variables, to eliminate the discretization process of continuous time based models. Continuity of route travel <b>time</b> <b>functions</b> is proven to establish {{the existence of a}} solution, on the condition that the link travel <b>time</b> <b>functions</b> are continuous. Furthermore, flow dispersion and concentration can be simulated, which is expected to enhance the ability of capturing dynamics of traffic movements. A variational inequality formulation based on an alternative cost mapping is proposed, which is derived from a route swapping heuristic approach. As a solution method, the projection-based approach is used since the route travel <b>time</b> <b>functions</b> in our model are not smooth. To increase the performance of the projection-based methods, an efficient implementation of the projection operation is developed. Computational experiences with two example networks are provided to illustrate the model. ...|$|R

Dynamic link {{travel times}} are first classified according to various applications. Subsequently, stochastic and deterministic travel <b>time</b> <b>functions</b> for longer and shorter time horizons are discussed separately, and {{two sets of}} functions are recommended for dynamic transportation network problems. The implications of those functional forms are analyzed and some modifications for dynamic network models are suggested. In addition, based on dynamic link travel <b>time</b> <b>functions,</b> we discuss how many independent variables are necessary to describe the temporal traffic flow and properly estimate the time-dependent travel time and flow propagation over an arterial link. As a result, six link flow variables and corresponding link state and flow propagation equations are proposed as the basis to formulate dynamic transportation network models. ...|$|R
