He was also confident that Ferrari would perform well at the circuit. Barrichello revealed that he received backing from Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo to challenge for more victories and the championship despite the latter's comments to <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>about</b> Barrichello assisting Michael Schumacher's title aspirations.|$|E

Over the objections of Generoo and the agents, Belt orders the mission to proceed and lies to <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>about</b> its progress.

They were open with <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>about</b> their tactics, saying they hoped to subdue Arsenal's attack by having Billy Hardy keep Buchan at bay. Cardiff were free to choose their first choice team, unhindered by injuries. They selected the same team as had featured against Reading in the semi-final, with the exception of Harry Wake, despite his experience from playing in the FA Cup final two seasons prior.|$|E
5|$|Further {{controversy}} ensued at the Belgian Grand Prix at the Spa circuit. The circuit {{had been}} paved {{just days before}} the race, creating a track that many of the racers felt was unsafe due to diesel fuel seeping to the surface. Roberts and the new championship points leader, Virginio Ferrari, instigated a riders' revolt and refused to race. Once again, the FIM responded by suspending Roberts and Ferrari. The FIM later reduced this to another probation. The event highlighted the animosity between Roberts and the FIM concerning track safety. Roberts further irritated the FIM when he began talking to <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>about</b> forming a rival racing series to compete against the FIM's monopoly.|$|E
5|$|The Police Directorate {{sees the}} use of the {{encrypted}} communication as the system's greatest benefit, and has stated that it sees no reason for the implementation to stop while it is being evaluated, and that there is no alternative to implementing it nationally. The system was first taken into use in Østfold and Follo in December 2009, and by Oslo in March 2010. In Oslo, the police chose to close the analog network down before the TETRA system had been installed in all vehicles, and instead give all officers hand-held devices, to speed up the closing of the old network, which is regarded as a security hazard. Traditionally, journalists have learned about events by listening to the police radios. The police have appointed press officers who will inform <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>about</b> newsworthy incidents. The alarm center for the fire departments in Østfold and Follo started using the system in June 2010.|$|E

5|$|The {{tensions}} between Stretford and the Estates Company {{began to come}} to a head in 1906, when in response to complaints in <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>about</b> the state of one particular road in the park, Trafford Park Road, Stretford issued formal notices demanding that all premises with frontage onto the road pay for its improvement. Further disputes over the standard of roads in the park followed until, in 1907, the Estates Company presented a petition to Lancashire County Council demanding that Trafford Park should be an urban district in its own right, independent of Stretford. The county council dismissed the petition, but later that year, following a petition organised by the Trafford Park Ratepayers Association, a new local government ward, Park Ward, was created within Stretford, The new ward did not include {{the western part of the}} park however, which remained under the control of Barton-upon-Irwell.|$|E
