The patterns identified by our system form a base for application specific instruction selection and processor extension generation. Our method identifies all computational patterns directly from an application graph satisfying all architectural and <b>technological</b> <b>constraints</b> imposed by target processors and FPGA devices. The considered constraints include a number of inputs and outputs, a number of operators, and a delay of the pattern critical path. Therefore the identified patterns can be well tailored to target processors. Our approach uses heavily constraint programming methods, which makes it possible to mix graph isomorphism constraints with other constraints in one formal environment. We have extensively evaluated our algorithm on MediaBench and MiBench benchmarks with tough architectural and <b>technological</b> <b>constraints.</b> The obtained patterns have good coverage of application graphs while limiting number of operators and fulfill architectural and <b>technological</b> <b>constraints...</b>|$|R

30|$|Spark models {{streaming}} computations as {{a series}} of stateless, deterministic batch computations on small batches of data—μ-batch. In particular, streams are discretized into a sequence of immutable, partitioned RDDs, which enable Spark to reuse the strategies and algorithms for batch computation also in streaming scenarios. This approach trades latency for throughput, since it delays a computation until a μ-batch is available. The μ-batch approach has also some consequences on the semantics of processing. Specifically, Spark only supports time windows having a size and slide that are multiple of the μ-batch size.

40|$|What {{are the key}} {{determinants}} of financial development and growth? A large literature debates {{the relative importance of}} countries ’ legal and political environment. In this paper, I present evidence from ancient Rome, where an early form of shareholder company, the societas publicanorum, developed. I show that the societas publicanorum flourished in a legally underdeveloped but politically supportive environment (Roman Republic) and disappeared when Roman law reached its height of legal sophistication but the political environment grew less supportive (Roman Empire). In the Roman case, legal development appears to have mattered little as long as the law as practiced was flexible and adapted to economic needs. The ‘law as practiced, ’ in turn, reflected prevalent political interests. After discussing parallels in more recent history, I provide a brief overview of the literature on law and finance and on politics and finance. The historical evidence suggests that legal systems may be less of a <b>technological</b> <b>constraint</b> for growth than previously thought—at least “at the origin. ”...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe ongoing {{improvements}} in the size and {{in the power of}} micro-controllers allow to implement real-time computations of digital filters or control laws. With audio dedicated components, it becomes easier to integrate the control of piezoelectric transducers directly inside structures with discretized feedback controllers. It paves the way to more intelligent systems with adaptive capabilities. Through the z-transform, the behavior of an electrical impedance or of a controller can be written as a recurrent equation directly computable by a micro-controller. Yet the signals are sampled and quantified and it is necessary to run the computations at least twice as fast as the higher frequency f the controlled structure. The delay induced by the computations and the conversion of the signals has {{to be taken into account}} to insure the stability of the control. Finally, the type of computation (fixed or floating point) can be a technological problem.

We develop e#cient integer linear programming (ILP) formulations to address these problems and perform both placement and routing simultaneously. This ensures that the solution is a lower bound for both problems. We {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} our proposed techniques on a variety of benchmark...|$|E

When this <b>technological</b> <b>constraint</b> is dropped, a physical bound is found at λ≈ 1 nm (E≈ keV) for distances out to kpc. While shorter wavelengths may produce tighter beams and thus higher data rates, the physical limit comes from surface roughness of focusing devices at the atomic level. This limit can be surpassed by beam-forming with electromagnetic fields, e. g. using a free electron laser, but such methods are not energetically competitive. Current lasers are not yet cost efficient at nm wavelengths, with a gap of two orders of magnitude, but future technological progress may converge on the physical optimum.

40|$|Changes in {{the scope}} of IP legal rights are {{generally}} thought {{to be linked to}} changes in positive law. This Article argues that shifts in {{the scope of}} IP laws are often driven by changes in technological feasibility and not by changes in positive law. Diminishing <b>technological</b> <b>constraint</b> is an under-acknowledged factor driving changes in substantive IP law. More specifically, there are certain activities that are core to IP law. Such activities include, for example, the copying of creative works in copyright (e. g. duplicating books or music), or the manufacturing of products in patent law. Traditionally, IP legal theory has not directly accounted for how these activities can become easier (or harder) to do, over time, with technological change. This Article proposes the term “Technological Cost” to capture how activities central to IP legal governance can expand in capacity over time as technology changes. This is important to consider because core IP activities are often implicitly constrained by limitations inherent to technological processes of the past. Positive IP laws, in turn, may be built upon the unstated assumption that such activities are (and will remain) implicitly constrained. However, the Technological Cost of such core IP activities often decreases over time with technological change. For example, the copying of creative works was initially Technologically Costly, and assumptions about Technological Cost were implicitly built into the structure of the Copyright laws and doctrines. Similarly, the Technological Cost of research in certain inventive areas – such as gene sequencing research - was initially Technologically Costly, and assumptions about such high Technological Cost were implicitly built into the substance and structure of patent doctrines or laws governing these areas. Importantly as new technologies emerge Technological Cost decreases, and the implicit technological constraints that effectively constrained activities in the previous era dissipate. Thus, previously limited activities can become dramatically more expansive in capacity and can acquire entirely new properties that were previously infeasible. As this occurs, IP laws that were based upon earlier assumptions of inherent constraint and that are linked to these activities can subtly but meaningfully shift in legal scope. Thus, both doctrines in copyright law and patent law have effectively shifted in legal scope over time as the Technological Cost of central activities such as copying creative works or manufacturing goods decreased. Such technologically induced shifts in legal scope may be hard to observe because positive law often remains unchanged. This Article offers a framework for reifying relationships of implicit constraint by technological limitations of the past, and how decrease in implicit <b>technological</b> <b>constraint</b> can subtly impact substantive IP law...|$|E
