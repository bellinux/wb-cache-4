5|$|The {{primary cause}} of {{vibrations}} in a properly functioning bicycle is the surface over which it rolls. In addition to pneumatic tires and traditional bicycle suspensions, {{a variety of techniques}} have been developed <b>to</b> <b>damp</b> vibrations before they reach the rider. These include materials, such as carbon fiber, either in the whole frame or just key components such as the front fork, seatpost, or handlebars; tube shapes, such as curved seat stays; and special inserts, such as Zertz by Specialized, and Buzzkills by Bontrager.|$|E
5|$|The RAE's {{comments}} about the self-exciting transmitter were not random: they were referring to work that was just coming to fruition at EMI {{as a direct result}} of Lewis' earlier contract. EMI engineers Alan Blumlein and Eric White had developed a system that dispensed with a self-exciting transmitter circuit and instead used a separate modulator that fed the signal into the transmitter for amplification. The oscillator signal was also sent to the receiver, using it <b>to</b> <b>damp</b> its sensitivity. The combined effect was to sharpen the transmitted pulse, while reducing 'ringing' in the receiver. In a test in May 1940, Hanbury Brown was able to clearly see the return at a range of , and could still make it out when they approached to 400.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} technique employed was fresco, {{in which}} the paint is applied <b>to</b> <b>damp</b> plaster. Michelangelo had been an apprentice in the workshop of Domenico Ghirlandaio, {{one of the most}} competent and prolific of Florentine fresco painters, {{at the time that the}} latter was employed on a fresco cycle at Santa Maria Novella and whose work was represented on the walls of the Sistine Chapel. At the outset, the plaster, , began to grow mold because it was too wet. Michelangelo had to remove it and start again. He then tried a new formula created by one of his assistants, Jacopo l'Indaco, which resisted mold and entered the Italian building tradition.|$|E

25|$|Bass traps are {{acoustic}} energy absorbers which are designed <b>to</b> <b>damp</b> low frequency sound energy {{with the goal}} of attaining a flatter low frequency (LF) room response by reducing LF resonances in rooms. They are commonly used in recording studios, mastering rooms, home theatres and other rooms built to provide a critical listening environment.

This chapter analyzes {{applicability of}} different models of anelasticity <b>to</b> <b>damping</b> capacity of shape memory alloys {{both in the}} martensitic state and during the martensitic transformation. The chapter focuses mainly on recent observations made in Cu-based and NiTi alloys. From the latest works {{it is evident that}} the high damping capacity can not only be related to the hysteretic mobility of interfaces between martensitic variants but may be associated as well with internal defects of variants. An introduction <b>to</b> <b>damping</b> Damping reflects the efficiency of a system to dissipate the energy of mechanical oscillations. Several equivalent characteristics of damping are used, depending on the experimental technique employed <b>to</b> measure <b>damping</b> properties.

25|$|Parasitic worms {{have been}} used as a medical {{treatment}} for various diseases, particularly those involving an overactive immune response. As humans have evolved with parasitic worms, proponents argue they are needed for a healthy immune system. Scientists are looking for a connection between the prevention and control of parasitic worms and the increase in allergies such as hay-fever in developed countries. Parasitic worms may be able <b>to</b> <b>damp</b> down the immune system of their host, making it easier for them to live in the intestine without coming under attack. This may be one mechanism for their proposed medicinal effect.|$|E
25|$|Weaving is the {{technique}} of playing a succession of bells by changing which bell is in each hand as required. This is used by bass and solo or small-ensemble ringers. The large size and weight of bass bells makes four-in-hand ringing impractical and impossible, and often a solo or small-ensemble ringer will need to {{move up and down}} a range of bells, possibly sharing them with others. This technique means more than two bells can be rung in short succession, using the table <b>to</b> <b>damp</b> and free the hand to pick up the next bell. If the ringing sequence requires bells to be rung in tonal order, this technique often results in a weaving pattern as the ringer must often reach across his or her body for the next bell.|$|E

Three months later, the Main Stand, which was being used as a temporary National Fire Service station, burned down, destroying the club's records and equipment – [...] "not so much as a lead pencil was saved from the wreckage" [...] – when a fireman mistook a bucket of petrol for water when intending <b>to</b> <b>damp</b> down a brazier.

500|$|In a like manner, {{the lunar}} surface {{experiences}} tides of around [...] amplitude over 27days, with two components: a fixed one due to Earth, {{because they are in}} synchronous rotation, and a varying component from the Sun. The Earth-induced component arises from libration, a result of the Moon's orbital eccentricity (if the Moon's orbit were perfectly circular, there would only be solar tides). Libration also changes the angle from which the Moon is seen, allowing a total of about 59% of its surface to be seen from Earth over time. The cumulative effects of stress built up by these tidal forces produces moonquakes. Moonquakes are much less common and weaker than are earthquakes, although moon quakes can last for up to an hour—a significantly longer time than terrestrial quakes—because of the absence of water <b>to</b> <b>damp</b> out the seismic vibrations. The existence of moonquakes was an unexpected discovery from seismometers placed on the Moon by Apollo astronauts from 1969 through 1972.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{was working}} as an {{entrepreneur}} in digital audio electronics in 1993 when Barbra Streisand's producer asked him to mix her first concert tour in decades. Jackson signed on partly because he was assured he could {{do anything to make}} her concert sound as good as possible. Jackson determined that huge concert venues such as Wembley Stadium and Madison Square Garden would be carpeted for Streisand, and that expensive heavy drapes would be hung at the walls <b>to</b> <b>damp</b> sound reflections. After discovering that Streisand did not like to listen to any stage monitors made after the 1960s, he designed a stage wedge which used soft dome drivers for midrange and for high frequencies rather than the more powerful compression drivers in common use after the 1970s. As well, the main sound system Jackson specified was a new design by Clair Brothers, a proprietary line array system called the I4. Streisand was not willing to wear in-ear monitors but the band was fitted with them, to reduce stage wash and make the band's instruments stand out better individually in the mix. The stage monitors, line array and extravagant acoustic treatments were a hit with Streisand, who said of Jackson that he was [...] "the best sound engineer in the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Unfortunately, {{shortly before}} dawn on May 12, Union forces {{comprising}} three full divisions (Major General Winfield S. Hancock's II Corps) attacked the Mule Shoe through heavy fog, taking the Confederate forces by surprise. Exhaustion, inadequate food, lack of artillery support, and wet powder from the night's rain {{contributed to the}} collapse of the Confederate position as the Union forces swarmed out of the mist, overwhelming Steuart's men and effectively putting an end to the Virginia Brigade. Confederate muskets would not fire due <b>to</b> <b>damp</b> powder, and apart from two remaining artillery pieces, the Southerners were effectively without firearms. During the thick of the fierce hand-to-hand fighting that followed, Steuart was forced to surrender to Colonel James A. Beaver of the 148th Pennsylvania Infantry. Beaver asked Steuart [...] "Where is your sword, sir?", to which the general replied, with considerable sarcasm, [...] "Well, suh, you all waked us up so early this mawnin' that I didn't have time to get it on." [...] Steuart was brought to General Hancock, who had seen Steuart's wife Maria in Washington before the battle and wished to give her news of her husband. He extended his hand, asking [...] "how are you, Steuart?" [...] But Steuart refused to shake Hancock's hand; although the two men had been friends before the war, they were now enemies. Steuart said: [...] "Considering the circumstance, General, I refuse to take your hand", to which Hancock is said to have replied, [...] "And under any other circumstance, General, I would have refused to offer it." [...] After this episode, an offended Hancock then left Steuart to march to the Union rear with the other prisoners.|$|E

2500|$|The keel {{surface on}} the bottom of the hull gives the ship greater {{directional}} control and stability. In non-sailing hulls, the keel helps the hull to move forward, rather than slipping to the side. In traditional boat building, this is provided by the structural keel, which projects from the bottom of the hull along most or all of its length. In modern construction, the bar keel or flat-plate keel performs the same function. There are many types of fixed keels, including full keels, long keels, fin keels, winged keels, bulb keels, and bilge keels among other designs.

40|$|Cold {{temperatures}} lead to nullification of circadian rhythms in many organisms. Two typical scenarios {{explain the}} disappearance of rhythmicity: the first is oscillation death, which is the transition from self-sustained oscillation <b>to</b> <b>damped</b> oscillation that occurs at a critical temperature. The second scenario is oscillation arrest, in which oscillation terminates at a certain phase. In the field of nonlinear dynamics, these mechanisms are called the Hopf bifurcation and the saddle-node on an invariant circle bifurcation, respectively. Although these mechanisms lead to distinct dynamical properties near the critical temperature, it is unclear to which scenario the circadian clock belongs. Here we reduced the temperature to dampen the reconstituted circadian rhythm of phosphorylation of the recombinant cyanobacterial clock protein KaiC. The data led us to conclude that Hopf bifurcation occurred at ∼ 19 °C. Below this critical temperature, the self-sustained rhythms of KaiC phosphorylation transformed <b>to</b> <b>damped</b> oscillations, which are predicted by the Hopf bifurcation theory. Moreover, we detected resonant oscillations below the critical temperature when temperature was periodically varied, which was reproduced by numerical simulations.
