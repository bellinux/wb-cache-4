40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{providing}} a template {{of how to}} practice Continual Quality Improvement (CQI) in an Engineering Undergraduate Programme. At {{the inception of the}} programme, the academic curriculum is based upon the notion of the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduate</b> an institution of higher learning would like to produce. Hence, a graduate of a particular institution embodies its vision and mission. Taking this further and to ensure specificity in the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduate</b> produced, Engineering Programmes provide a set of Programme Educational Objectives (PEOs) which are derived from the vision and mission. From these PEOs, the Programme Outcomes (POs) are crafted, followed by the Learning Outcomes (LOs) at the module level – and hence the appropriate curriculum is decided upon. Once the programme is in full implementation, there exists a need to monitor and control the PEOs, POs and LOs to ensure that the programme progresses and evolves. Herein lies the need to practice CQI at all three levels. The following paper will provide an emphasis of how CQI, implemented correctly can result in enhancing the overall student learning experience...|$|E

Many studies have examined means of assuring the quality of education, mostly focusing on what <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduate</b> we should launch into the real world.

The USA has changed the idea about how to innovate, and in recent years has developed the Professional Science Master's (PSM) degree, which is now awarded by over 100 American universities. PSM programs have produced graduates who can innovate in scientific fields, e. g., in biology, environmental science, and statistics. The degree is highly praised by the Council On Competitiveness, which consists of CEOs of major corporations, university presidents, and heads of labor organizations. The PSM seems to meet their expectations. Interestingly, many research universities have established PSM programs. We examined the reasons why many American universities have accepted the PSM despite their daily duties for research and doctoral education.

The challenge is to develop IC to address the negative aspects of the livestock industry, yet continue the advances towards more efficient livestock production and improved qualities of livestock products. Investments in IC to sustain the livestock industry must not only be technical of an animal science nature, but should include external constituencies such as customers and various other associated entities. IC for the livestock industry is required at different levels that range from labourers to university science graduates. Undergraduate and postgraduate education in animal science must be designed to meet the objectives of a sustained career development and the ability to address the challenges facing the livestock industry. There need not be only one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduate,</b> but curricula can be adapted to provide graduates with a different focus and clearly defined output objectives of curricula designed in consultation with the industry.

40|$|Tropical {{biologists}} {{are exploring}} ways {{to expand their}} role as researchers through knowledge exchange with local stakeholders. Graduate students are well positioned for this broader role, particularly when supported by graduate programs. We ask: (1) how can graduate students effectively engage in knowledge exchange during their research; and (2) how can university programs prepare young scientists {{to take on this}} partnership role? We present a conceptual framework with three levels at which graduate students can exchange knowledge with stakeholders (information sharing, skill building, and knowledge generation) and discuss limitations of each. Examples of these strategies included disseminating preliminary research results to southern African villages, building research skills of Brazilian undergraduate students through semester-long internships, and jointly developing and implementing a forest ecology research and training program with one community in the Amazon estuary. Students chose strategies based on stakeholders' interests, research goals, and a realistic evaluation of student capacity and skill set. As strategies became more complex, time invested, skills mobilized, and strength of relationships between students and stakeholders increased. Graduate programs can prepare students for knowledge exchange with partners by developing specialized skills training, nurturing external networks, offering funding, maximizing strengths of universities in developed and developing regions through partnership, and evaluating knowledge exchange experiences. While balancing the needs of academia with those of stakeholders is challenging, the benefits of enhancing local scientific capacity and generating more locally relevant research for improved conservation may be worth the risks associated with implementing this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduate</b> training model...|$|E
40|$|In 1973 two trial {{pre-registration}} {{nursing education}} programmes were piloted in New Zealand polytechnics. These represented {{an alternative to}} traditional hospital-sited schools of nursing. The establishment of nursing education in the tertiary sector marked a radical challenge to the cultural heritage of apprenticeship-style nursing training associated with paternal and medically-dominated health institutions. This thesis offers a Foucauldian and feminist poststructuralist analysis of discourses employed by fifteen senior nursing educators in the comprehensive registration programmes between 1973 and 1992. The women employed {{to teach in the}} comprehensive programmes faced unique challenges in establishing departments of nursing, in developing curricula that would promote a reorientation of nursing and in supporting candidates to attain their nursing registration. Through semi-structured interviews and discourse analysis methods, a set of unique characteristics shared by this group of early leading comprehensive nursing educators has emerged. The women's narratives were underpinned by discourses that centre around the valuing of education as a vehicle for emancipation and an upholding of a legitimacy of difference in nursing educators' work. The participants upheld the importance of clinical practice skills and drew on their own student nursing experiences as incentives for reforming nursing education. These nursing educators conceptualised an idealised <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduate,</b> and commonly employed an heroic metaphor to describe their experiences as senior comprehensive educators. Their engagement with such discourses and their shared characteristics demonstrate unique re-constitutions of power, knowledge and relations with their colleagues and clients throughout the education and health care sectors. I propose that these traits characterise the women as strategic and astute professionals who successfully negotiated the construction of comprehensive nursing programmes as a legitimate and transformative preparation for nursing registration...|$|E

Graduates were classified according to their sequential migration behavior first from their pre-university domicile to university and then from university to first job post-graduation. Our results show that ‘repeat migration’, as expected, is associated with the highest wage premium (around 15 %). Other migration behaviors are also advantageous although this varies across different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduates.</b> Creative graduates, for instance, do not benefit much from migration behaviors other than repeat migration.

The paper highlights some concepts of socio-economic relevance which have negatively impacted the Education system and introduces a Development Philosophy concept {{that is required}} during the training of Engineering, Social and Physical Science Undergraduates in Zimbabwe's State Universities. As a nation we have done well in establishing a sound university education system, but the focus has since shifted from demand for university education to demand for a vibrant economy that provides sufficient employment to its graduates. The progress {{that has been made}} in the higher education sector has been phenomenal but still falls short of economic expectations in a number of sectors. It is fact that by and large, the nature of the subjects taught in Sub-Sahara African Universities including our state universities are primarily within the traditional Science and Engineering disciplines and are regularly modified to be in line with global trends in social, technological and scientific advancement. The economic challenges facing Zimbabwe and its State Universities now necessitate a new approach to university education that produces a different <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduate</b> that is empowered individually, corporately and nationally through a philosophical study of the relationships between economic development, skills, equipment, capital and resource utilization. This paper also presents the basis for a course of action required for enhancing the education and human resource development in Sub-Saharan Africa, although the focus will be on Zimbabwe through a strategic process of aligning attitudes and understanding towards sustainable socioeconomic growth using state universities and colleges. Globally, some national attitudes can be observed as follows: (I) Under “similar conditions” one nation will contemplate war with another nation over the death of one or two of its citizens whilst for another nation hundreds have to die before being forced to accept that there is a national disaster. (Ii) In one nation a large piece of land is turned into a thriving economy whilst in another, similar land is turned into hazardous wasteland. These two precursors highlight strengths and weaknesses that can be embodied in public education systems in shaping socio-economic norms and values...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to explore with selected nurses in the employment setting their perspective of the clinical competence of newly graduated nurses as they entered practice. ^ The study had three elements. The initial focus {{of the study was to}} examine the readiness of graduates from all preparatory programs to enter hospital practice, addressing, in particular, the clinical competence of the nurse and, therefore, the ability of that nurse to meet the nursing needs of the patient. ^ The second element was to explore the differences, if any, between graduates of Baccalaureate, Associate Degree and Diploma Programs as those differences relate to clinical competence. ^ The third area dealt with the nurturing and socialization of the new graduate in the practice setting and examined the methods employed by the hospital to orient the nurse to the practice setting and provide support and additional education and experience to bring the nurse to the practice level expected. ^ Major findings identified differences in graduates from the three types of nursing programs. Graduates of Baccalaureate programs were described as having a stronger theoretical knowledge base and better critical thinking skills. It was expected the Baccalaureate graduate would become the more competent nurse over time. Graduates of Diploma Programs were reported to have better clinical skills. Associate Degree Program graduates were said to be lacking in both clinical skills and theoretical knowledge. ^ Two factors were mentioned as important in shaping clinical competence. Individual differences which the nurse brings with her are thought to be a significant factor, even more than the program from which the nurse was graduated. Programs, which prepare the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduate,</b> do not always graduate nurses of the same quality. ^ Graduates of all programs were noted as needing extensive support as they began their new role.
