However, Lord Frey has sealed off the bridge and refuses to let the army cross, so Catelyn negotiates on her son Robb's behalf. After some hard bargaining, Frey agrees to allow the Stark army <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>through</b> The Twins and to commit some of his troops to the conflict with the Lannisters, but, in return, he wants Robb and his sister Arya to marry two of his children, to which Robb reluctantly agrees.|$|E
5|$|Route 58 {{originates}} as an {{alignment of}} State Highway Route 25-A, designated in 1939 as a suffixed spur of State Highway Route 25 from Jersey City to Clifton Avenue in Newark. The route was designated <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>through</b> Kearny and Harrison, crossing the Passaic at the Bridge Street Bridge in Harrison. From there, it continued along, intersecting with State Highway Route 21 and Clifton Avenue. In 1949, a new bridge for the four-lane road was constructed, this bridge {{was named after}} William Stickel, an engineer from Essex County. That year, the New Jersey State Highway Department proposed {{construction of a new}} freeway to help alleviate traffic on the State Highway Route 10 corridor, designated as the Essex Freeway from the New Jersey Turnpike in Hudson County westward to U.S. Route 46 in Morris County.|$|E
5|$|State Route958 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with a two-lane U.S. Route6 {{east of the}} city of Corry. The route progresses northward as a two-lane roadway through the rural regions of western Pennsylvania. Route958 soon enters the community of Wrightsville, a small community of a few residences and mostly fields. At Deadmans Run Road, the highway begins <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>through</b> a populated area, however, it soon leaves Wrightsville and turns to the northwest in the deep fields north of the community. The northwestern bend curves back to the northward progression and Route958 passes through a large farm near an intersection with Kidder Road. Some residences parallel the highway as it makes another northwestern bend and soon comes on a northward stretch into the community of Lottsville, where the highway intersects with Route957.|$|E

More crucially, President Wilson gave his permission for Carranzista troops <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>through</b> American territory in order to strengthen the garrison at Agua Prieta. About 3,500 fresh, veteran troops traveled through Arizona and New Mexico and arrived in the town in early October, bringing {{the total number of}} defenders to 6,500. Villa was completely unaware of this development; according to American correspondent and friend of Villa John W. Roberts, Villa believed the town was defended by only 1,200 soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{the town}} might cease to officially exist, but the {{physical}} infrastructure remains. For example, the five Mississippi communities {{that had to}} be abandoned to build SSC still have remnants of those communities within the facility itself. These include city streets, now overgrown with forest flora and fauna, and a one-room school house. Another example of infrastructure remaining is the former town of Weston, Illinois, that voted itself out of existence and turned the land over for construction of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. Many houses and even a few barns remain, used for housing visiting scientists and storing maintenance equipment, while roads that used <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>through</b> the site have been blocked off {{at the edges of the}} property, with gatehouses or simply barricades to prevent unsupervised access.|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} {{moved to}} the United Kingdom and shot in a converted airship hangar in Cardington, Bedfordshire, north of London. There, the hotel bar set which tilted 30 degrees was built. A hotel corridor was also constructed by Guy Hendrix Dyas, the production designer, Chris Corbould, the special effects supervisor, and Wally Pfister, the director of photography; it rotated a full 360degrees to create the effect of alternate directions of gravity for scenes set during the second level of dreaming, where dream-sector physics become chaotic. The idea {{was inspired by a}} technique used in Stanley Kubrick's [...] (1968). Nolan said, [...] "I was interested in taking those ideas, techniques, and philosophies and applying them to an action scenario". The filmmakers originally planned to make the hallway only 40ft (12m) long, but as the action sequence became more elaborate, the hallway's length grew to 100ft (30m). The corridor was suspended along eight large concentric rings that were spaced equidistantly outside its walls and powered by two massive electric motors. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays Arthur, spent several weeks learning to fight in a corridor that spun like [...] "a giant hamster wheel". Nolan said of the device, [...] "It was like some incredible torture device; we thrashed Joseph for weeks, but in the end we looked at the footage, and it looks unlike anything any of us has seen before. The rhythm of it is unique, and when you watch it, even if you know how it was done, it confuses your perceptions. It's unsettling in a wonderful way". Gordon-Levitt remembered, [...] "it was six-day weeks of just, like, coming home at night battered ... The light fixtures on the ceiling are coming around on the floor, and you have to choose the right time <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>through</b> them, and if you don't, you're going to fall." [...] On July15,2009, filming took place at University College London for the sequences occurring inside a Paris college of architecture in the story, including the library, Flaxman Gallery and Gustav Tuck Theatre.|$|E

2500|$|Through {{as late as}} 27 July, Jagow {{expressed}} the view that Russian partial mobilization against the frontiers of Austria-Hungary was not a casus belli, Moltke instead argued that Germany should mobilize at once and attack France. Moltke was overruled by Bethmann Hollweg in two meetings on 29 July, who argued that Germany should wait for Russia to begin a general mobilization. As Bethmann Hollweg told Moltke, {{this was the best}} way to ensure that blame for the [...] "whole shemozzle" [...] could be placed on Russia’s door, and thus ensure British neutrality. While promising not to start mobilization without the Chancellor's orders, Moltke ordered the German military attaché in Belgium to ask for permission for German troops <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>through</b> on the way to attack France. Also on July 28, Bethmann Hollweg offered to form an anti-Russian military alliance with Turkey.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} with the proposed alignment of the expressway was that it divided each community that it passed through. This was met by protests {{from all of the}} communities. To remedy the concerns, Lewis Waters, the Oyster Bay Town Supervisor, proposed a new alignment for the expressway. Under his plan, it would now begin at the Ocean Parkway in Tobay Beach, cross Great South Bay and enter West Amityville at Clocks Boulevard. From West Amityville, the expressway was to turn to the northeast near the current-day Sunrise Mall, and progress its way through Massapequa and Farmingdale into Bethpage State Park. The highway was <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>through</b> Bethpage State Park using the old right-of-way for the Bethpage State Parkway through the communities of Old Bethpage and Plainview. From there, it would veer to the northwest, approaching and intersecting with the Jericho Turnpike (NY25) about [...] from its current northern terminus. At the Long Island Rail Road's Port Jefferson Branch, it would follow the originally planned alignment, but would end at NY25A instead of NY106.|$|E
2500|$|Behind the scenes, Clark had {{discovered}} that Moses had {{made a deal with}} Otto Hermann Kahn to realign the Northern State around his private golf course. Clark forwarded his discovery to Hutchinson and Hewitt, who in turn, demanded the payment sources for all purchases of private property. They also requested the information if any alignment was <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>through</b> the route of a donor and was it changed after the gift. Moses denied the accusations made by Hewitt and Hutchinson, but soon admitted to Roosevelt that he had accepted $10,000 (1929USD) to shift the route but said the shift was to satisfy the objections of local landowners who refused to accept the alignment in Dix Hills. Roosevelt originally wanted to support the alignment through Wheatley Hills, but once Clark threatened to expose the disclosure to the public, he relented. On October 23, 1929, Clark told Roosevelt that the citizens were sick of Moses, who they claimed [...] "refused to compromise" [...] and was [...] "highly insulting". Roosevelt wasted no time coming up with a compromise to make the route have an abrupt turn at Glen Cove Road in Wheatley Hills.|$|E

There Andrews and his raiders hijacked the General and the train's first car.

[...] The raiders planned <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>through</b> the Federal siege lines on the outskirts of Chattanooga and rejoin Mitchel's army.

2500|$|The prince's journey {{begins with}} an act of pity: upon {{preparing}} to cross a bridge, the hero notes that {{it is home to}} an ant colony, and, fearful of destroying it, opts instead <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>through</b> the riverbed. An alate ant visits him and rewards his deed with one of its wings, guaranteeing that, should he ever need assistance, burning the item would instantly summon the entire colony to his aid. A similar encounter takes place after Harap Alb fashions his hat into a hive, to be used by a homeless swarm of bees: the grateful queen bee presents him with another wing, with which to summon her and her subjects. Further down on his path, Harap Alb gradually collects a band of followers. The first among them is Gerilă (from ger, [...] "frost", and the diminutive suffix -ilă), a man who shivers in summer, and whose cold breath, reaching the fury of a strong wind, can turn things into ice. Confronted with astonishment and some irony by the prince, Gerilă answers: [...] "Laugh if you will, Harap Alb, but you'll not be able to accomplish anything without me where you're going." [...] The reply prompts its recipient to change his mind, and creates a bond between the two characters. They are joined by Flămânzilă (from flămând, [...] "hungry"; translated as [...] "Eat-All"), who can consume huge amounts without satisfying his appetite. Next comes Setilă (from sete, [...] "thirst"; also [...] "Drink-All"), Flămânzilă's counterpart among drinkers. These in turn are followed by Ochilă (from ochi, [...] "eye"), whose sight covers immense distances, and Păsări-Lăți-Lungilă (from pasăre, [...] "bird", a se lăți, [...] "to widen oneself" [...] and a se lungi, [...] "to lengthen oneself"), who can will himself to grow in any direction and reach heights only accessible to birds. They all persuade Harap Alb to discard his reticence by issuing forecasts closely resembling Gerilă's reply. The first effect of this reunion is however disastrous: the respective traits of the characters result in burning down entire forests, depleting the soil, draining the water, exposing all secrets and exterminating birds, with Harap Alb himself being the only one who [...] "did not cause any disruption." ...|$|E
