The outward-opening design would allow the hatch to be blown open by the pressure inside the cargo area if the latch failed during flight.

40|$|Lecturepg. 113 - 128 A 10, 000 psi high {{pressure}} natural gas injection compressor train was procured, manufactured, tested and {{installed in the}} Boquer?n production facility in Eastern Venezuela. The injection machinery consisted of three (3) parallel slow speed reciprocating gas compressors each driven by a natural gas driven internal combustion engine through a speed reducing gearbox. The equipment had been purchased in an early phase of the project by the original oil company, so {{it could not be}} changed. Due to the critical timing of compression required to maintain reservoir pressure and incremental oil recovery, the equipment could not be changed without large financial consequences. After preliminary review of the purchased equipment, it was recognized early by the engineer, procure, and construct (EPC) design engineering team that the compressor type and selection including the design were not the preferred arrangement. However, due to schedule and contract constraints the selection and design could not be significantly changed. Although the compressor itself was considered properly selected there was considerable attention given to the drive train. This drive train consisted of the internal combustion engine, a gearbox, a steel <b>torque</b> <b>shaft</b> that connected the gearbox to the compressor and an intermediate bearing/bearing support. As the project progressed there were significant design improvements made to improve the safety, operation, and life of the compressor train. The initial design of the <b>torque</b> <b>shaft</b> indicated that it would fail every time the machinery experienced a shutdown. In order to overcome such a failure the drive train included a special coupling with shear bolts that would shear every time the compressor train had shut down, the function of which was to prevent the <b>torque</b> <b>shaft</b> from fatigue failure. Shearing bolts during every shutdown was not considered safe or acceptable operating practice. During the course of the project, there were significant improvements made, first to the <b>torque</b> <b>shaft,</b> and then to the coupling connecting the gearbox to the <b>torque</b> <b>shaft,</b> then to the coupling between the engine and high speed gear pinion. The torsional characteristics were improved significantly with the upgrades and design improvements. After installation, extensive field testing was conducted on each injection gas compressor to ascertain the torsional characteristics of the drive train, including stresses in critical components during the shutdown events. The data confirmed that the <b>torque</b> <b>shaft</b> was in fact designed for infinite life and would not fail from material fatigue as was feared initially. During the design phases engineering consultants were contracted to perform torsional studies to confirm the torsional critical speeds initially predicted by the compressor manufacturer. After installation the same consultant used strain gauges to measure the torsional shear stresses and the torsional critical speeds. There was an enormous amount of valuable engineering data generated during the design verification process and field testing. The authors feel that this information should be shared with others in {{the oil and gas industry}} when considering this type of machinery and machinery train for their {{high pressure}} injection gas compressor services or projects...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the dynamic {{response}} of the induction machine to low-frequency perturbations in the <b>shaft</b> <b>torque,</b> supply voltage and supply frequency. Also the response of a two-machine group connected to a weak grid is investigated. The results predicted by various induction machine models are compared with measurements performed on a laboratory set-up. Furthermore, the influence of machine and grid parameters, machine temperature, phase-compensating capacitors, skin effect, saturation level and operating points is studied. The results predicted by the fifth-order non-linear Park model agree well with the measured induction machine responses to <b>shaft</b> <b>torque,</b> supply frequency and voltage magnitude perturbations. To determine the electric power response to very low-frequency perturbations in {{the magnitude of the}} supply voltage, the Park model must be modified to take varying iron losses into account. The temperature and supply frequency affect the low-frequency dynamics of the induction machine significantly while the influence of saturation, phase-compensating capacitors, skin effect and static <b>shaft</b> <b>torque</b> is of less importance to an ordinary industrial machine. The static <b>shaft</b> <b>torque</b> is, however, of importance for determining the responses to voltage magnitude perturbations. The performance of reduced-order induction machine models depends on the type of induction machine investigated. Best suited to be represented by reduced-order models are high-slip machines as well as machines that have a low ratio between the stator resistance and leakage reactances. A first-order model can predict the rotor speed, electrodynamic torque and electric power responses to <b>shaft</b> <b>torque</b> and supply frequency perturbations up to a perturbation frequency of at least 1 Hz. A second-order model can determine the same responses also for higher perturbation frequencies, at least up to 3 Hz.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} implementation of a <b>shaft</b> <b>torque</b> measurement system for the Oxford Turbine Research Facility (formerly the Turbine Test Facility (TTF) at QinetiQ, Farnborough), or OTRF. As part of the recent EU TATEF II programme, the facility was upgraded to allow turbine efficiency measurements to be performed. A <b>shaft</b> <b>torque</b> measurement system was developed as part of this upgrade. The system is unique in that, to the authors' knowledge, it provided the first direct measurement of <b>shaft</b> <b>torque</b> in a transient turbine facility although the system has wider applicability to rotating test facilities in which power measurement is a requirement. The adopted approach removes the requirement to quantify bearing friction, which can be difficult to accurately calibrate under representative operating conditions. The OTRF is a short duration (approximately 0. 4 s run time) isentropic light-piston facility capable of matching all of the non-dimensional parameters important for aerodynamic and heat studies, namely Mach number, Reynolds number, non-dimensional speed, stage pressure ratio and gas-to-wall temperature ratio. The single-stage MT 1 turbine used for this study is a highly loaded unshrouded design, and as such is relevant to modern military, or future civil aero-engine design. <b>Shaft</b> <b>torque</b> was measured directly using a custom-built strain gauge-based torque measurement system in the rotating frame of reference.
