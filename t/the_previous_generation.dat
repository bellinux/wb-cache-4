5|$|Apple {{released}} {{the third generation}} of MacBook Pro with a 15-inch screen during WWDC 2012 and discontinued the 17-inch variant. <b>The</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generation</b> 13- and 15-inch unibody models continued to sell with updated processors. The third generation model was a quarter thinner than its predecessor and introduced the Retina Display with a much higher screen resolution. A 13-inch variant was released in October 2012.|$|E
5|$|On October 23, 2012, Apple {{announced}} the fourth generation iPad, which began shipping on November 2, 2012. The new hardware includes an A6X processor, HD FaceTime camera, improved LTE compatibility, and the all-digital Lightning connector. It {{is available in}} the same storage increments and pricing structure as the third generation. Following the announcement of the fourth-generation iPad, <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generation</b> was discontinued.|$|E
5|$|When {{the game}} was renamed and changed platforms, the team chose Luminous Studio as the main game engine. The game's {{real-time}} graphics used 5,000 polygons per-frame, bringing its visual quality close to modern CGI cutscenes and to a level {{that would have been}} impossible for the previous generation's hardware. The game's native resolution was 1920 × 1080 pixels (1080p), with a frame rate of 30 frames per second: this was defined as being native to the game as opposed to upscaled games from <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generation.</b> For polygon models, the combined number of visible and occluded polygons was estimated as being 5,000,000. This number was approximately five times the amount of equivalent detail from last-generation games. Models used over 600 character bones: 150 bones were created for the face, 300 for the hair, and 150 for the body. A bone-based physical simulation technology was applied so that clothing would react to the body's movements. The polygon count for character hair was estimated as 20,000, the same number used in an entire character in last-generation games. All of these were achievable {{due to the fact that}} the eighth-generation console hardware had approximately sixteen times the amount of storage available in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generation.</b>|$|E
50|$|The new {{building}} constructed in 1957 {{was built on}} a new foundation. <b>The</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generations</b> of Foundation Boys' School, was constructed on the land where Christ Church High School used to b (that school has closed). The land is currently being occupied by a community centre which was constructed by the parish church. <b>The</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generations</b> of <b>the</b> Girls' School were situated in a small building, on the pasture by the current school's west gate.|$|R
50|$|Some {{of these}} {{capabilities}} have then seen widespread adoption by programmers, spurring consumer upgrades and making <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generations</b> of processors obsolete.|$|R
2500|$|Update (Clix+): (4GB, 8GB) A {{somewhat}} flatter Clix model {{featuring a}} DMB tuner. Like <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generations,</b> <b>the</b> Clix+ has a 2.2" [...] AMOLED screen.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to his copious output of madrigals and chansons, Arcadelt produced three masses, 24 motets, settings of the Magnificat, the Lamentations of Jeremiah, and some sacred chansons – the French equivalent of the madrigale spirituale. The masses are influenced by <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generation</b> of Franco-Flemish composers, particularly Jean Mouton and Josquin des Prez; the motets, avoiding the dense polyphony favored by the Netherlanders, are more declamatory and clear in texture, {{in a manner similar}} to his secular music. Much of his religious music, except for the sacred chansons, he probably wrote during his years in the papal chapel in Rome. Documents from the Sistine Chapel archives indicate that the choir sang his music during his residence there.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of Szabó’s career {{coincided with the}} {{beginning of}} a “new wave” in Hungarian cinema, one of several new wave cinemas that occurred around this time throughout Western and Eastern Europe. The Eastern European new waves were caused by political liberalization, the decentralization of film industries, and the emergence of films as valuable commodities for export to Western European markets. The resulting films were more formally experimental, politically anti-establishment, and, {{especially in the case of}} Szabó, psychologically probing than the films of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generation.</b> Hungarian filmmakers in particular experienced a significant increase in freedom of expression due to the reforms of the Kádár government.|$|E
5|$|The LS 430 {{first went}} on sale in the U.S. with an initial base price of US$55,000, ranging up to US$70,000 when fully equipped. At the high end, the LS 430's pricing encroached on European rivals as Lexus became {{increasingly}} able to command higher price premiums for its vehicles. Sales for the LS 430 surpassed <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generation,</b> and production exceeded 140,000 units. The LS 430 was produced until July 2006, marking the last occasion the Lexus flagship was produced in a single body style. In Japan, the equivalent Toyota Celsior was also sold from August 2000 until March 2006, when the long-awaited introduction of Lexus Japan saw the arrival of new generation Lexus models. XF30 design patents were filed by Toyota in domestic Japan, on 8 March 1999 at the Japan Patent Office under patent number 1080448.|$|E

30|$|The size of {{the next}} {{population}} {{is the same as}} <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> one, that is derived from selecting the best solutions by comparing <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generations</b> and <b>the</b> solutions generated by mutation and crossover operators.|$|R
5|$|Engine {{packaging}} {{became a}} contentious issue during development. Holden's designers wanted the engine positioned well {{behind the front}} axle to allow short overhangs and an overall sportier appearance, whereas the crash engineers were concerned that this would reduce the body's impact absorption in an accident. Negotiation between designers and crash engineers resulted in moving some of the engine components, including relocating the battery to the boot, freeing up valuable front-end space. By having the engine moved back and further down, the VE Commodore also benefits from near perfect 50:50 weight distribution across all variants, leading to superior handling. Crash engineers introduced several other safety initiatives, including relocating the fuel tank {{in front of the}} rear-axle line, instead of behind. A more crash-resistant rear-end was also seen as necessary. The design though had to incorporate a spacious boot and a spare-wheel bay that could house the largest-sized wheel to be fitted to the car. Crash test results from Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) rate the VE lower in the offset frontal impact test than <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generation</b> Commodore. The overall crash score was marginally higher than the outgoing VZ, due to improvements in side impact protection giving a score of 27.45 out of 37 or a four star rating out of a possible five.|$|E
5|$|Federer and Andre Agassi played {{each other}} 11 times between 1998 and 2005 before Agassi's {{retirement}} in 2006. Federer led the rivalry 8–3. This was Federer's most significant rivalry with an all-time great player of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generation.</b> They first met in {{only the third}} tournament of Federer's career at the 1998 Swiss Indoors in Federer's hometown, with Agassi prevailing over the 17-year-old. Agassi also defeated Federer at the 2001 US Open and the finals of the Miami Masters in 2002. Federer began to turn the tide at the Masters Cup in 2003, when he defeated Agassi in both the round robin and the final. They played a memorable quarterfinal match at the 2004 US Open that spanned over two days with Federer eventually prevailing in five sets. At the 2005 Dubai Championships, Federer and Agassi attracted worldwide headlines with a publicity stunt that saw the two tennis legends play on a helipad almost 220 meters above sea level at the hotel Burj al-Arab. Their final match was {{at one of the}} most prestigious platforms in the sport, when they played in the finals of the 2005 US Open. Federer was victorious in four sets, claiming the 6th Grand Slam tournament of his career and denying Agassi his 9th.|$|E
25|$|The {{exterior}} of the second generation was completely redesigned from the first generation. Its length was increased by a few inches, {{and it was a}} couple of hundred pounds heavier, and had a more rounded roofline. Every body panel, save for the doors, was redesigned. However, many of the redesigned components closely resembled that of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generation,</b> leading many to falsely believe that this generation is just a face-lift of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generation.</b>|$|E

50|$|The S-3600 was an {{improved}} {{version of the}} S-820 implemented in more modern semiconductor technology. The S-3800 was a new design, differing significantly from <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generations.</b> It was a parallel vector processor and supported one to four vector processors.|$|R
25|$|The {{interior}} was also completely redesigned for 1992. The Taurus received a new dashboard that, like <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generation,</b> {{was designed to}} be user friendly. Like <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generation,</b> it had all of the vehicle's main controls located near {{the left side of the}} dash, to be within the easy reach of the driver. Also like <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generation,</b> all of the controls were designed to be recognizable by touch, and to be operated by the driver without taking their eyes off the road. The new dash also contained three buttons to the right of the gauge cluster that allowed the driver to operate the radio without taking their eyes off the road. The radio was also redesigned, while the rest of the lower dash was carried over from <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generation,</b> as was the steering wheel. The new dash was also designed to contain a passenger's side airbag, a first of its kind. It was optional in 1991 in 1992 models, and became standard in 1993, making the Taurus the first car of its kind to have dual front airbags.|$|E
25|$|On April 4, 2017, an all-new sixth {{generation}} Buick Regal {{was introduced}} at its Design Dome in Warren, Michigan as a 2018 model in both hatchback and station wagon versions. Buick Regal began sales in China on 21 July 2017. Similar to <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generation,</b> {{it will be}} related to the Opel and Vauxhall Insignia sold in Europe, and like <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generation</b> the vehicles will be produced in Germany.|$|E
25|$|Many {{motoring}} reviewers {{praised the}} 3rd generation for its improved handling in corners and more supple ride over <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Like <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generations,</b> <b>the</b> chassis is a steel unibody. Unlike <b>previous</b> models, <b>the</b> new WK2 {{features}} four-wheel {{independent suspension}} for better on-road handling. The Grand Cherokee (with the 2011 Durango) WK2 platform uses a derivative based on Mercedes-Benz's W166 series.|$|R
50|$|Koenig, {{as one of}} {{the first}} tuning houses to {{specialize}} in expensive exotic cars, represented an era of independent German tuning houses of the 1980s such as Brabus and Gemballa that began to replace traditional coachbuilders of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generations.</b>|$|R
50|$|MPEG HD422 doubles the chroma {{horizontal}} resolution compared to <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>generations</b> of high-definition video XDCAM formats.
