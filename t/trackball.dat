5|$|An {{image of}} one of Onyx's early prototypes {{surfaced}} online, with a similar hardware to the 9000's, including the same <b>trackball.</b> That prototype was early reviewed by website CrackBerry, which confirmed diverse details about the device, such as the 480×360 display, the 3.2 megapixels camera and connectivity features—Wi-Fi and GPS. The same day, other information regarding technicalities were revealed on a surfaced AT filesheet about the smartphone. Already known as the BlackBerry 9020 and having started production, {{a photo of the}} device surfaced, though it replaced the <b>trackball</b> with a trackpad. A previous prototype with a <b>trackball</b> was put up for sale on eBay, where it passed the mark of $600; four days later, a pre-launch list of then-upcoming smartphones for AT surfaced online on August 9, 2009, which listed the device. A T-Mobile press image was leaked on September 8.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} toolkit for the Motorola CPU {{included a}} compiler for the C programming language, {{which the two}} programmers were familiar with. After Atari had conducted performance evaluations, it approved usage of the language. Cerny and Flanagan's decision to program Marble Madness in the C language had positive and negative consequences. Atari games had previously been programmed in assembly language. The C language was easier to program, but was less efficient, so the game operates at the slower speed of 30Hz instead of the normal 60Hz frequency of arcade games at the time. Cerny decided to use a <b>trackball</b> system (marketed by Atari as Trak-Ball) to give the game a unique control system, and he chose a motorized <b>trackball</b> for faster spinning and braking when the in-game ball traveled downhill and uphill, respectively. As it was building the prototypes, Atari's design department informed Cerny that the motorized trackball's design had an inherent flaw—one of the four supports had poor contact with the ball—and {{the use of a}} regular <b>trackball</b> was more feasible. Additionally, Cerny had anticipated the use of powerful custom chips that would allow RAM-based sprites to be animated by the CPU, but the available hardware was a less-advanced system using ROM-based, static sprites.|$|E
5|$|Marble Madness is an arcade {{video game}} {{designed}} by Mark Cerny {{and published by}} Atari Games in 1984. The player uses a <b>trackball</b> to guide an onscreen marble through six obstacle-filled courses within a time limit. Marble Madness was Atari's first game to use the Atari System 1 hardware and to be programmed in the C programming language. It {{was also one of}} the first games to use true stereo sound; previous games used either monaural sound or simulated stereo.|$|E

50|$|Some {{mobile phones}} have <b>trackballs,</b> {{including}} those in the BlackBerry range, the T-Mobile Sidekick 3, and many early HTC smartphones. These miniature <b>trackballs</b> are made to fit within the thickness of a mobile device, and are controlled by {{the tip of a}} finger or thumb. These have mostly been replaced on smartphones by touch screens.|$|R

5|$|The {{smartphone}} considerably reduces its predecessor's sizes, measuring 4.3 by 2.4 by 6 inches (10.92, 6.09 and 15.24 centimeters, respectively). The Bold 9700 has a 624MHz {{processor and}} a 256MB Flash memory. The device uses a 2.44 inch HVGA (approximately 6.1cm) non-touch LCD display at {{a resolution of}} 480×360 pixels. The resolution of the display was {{compared to that of}} HTC Magic, as it has also HVGA quality. The model changes its predecessor's <b>trackball</b> to an optical trackpad, with simple functionalities such as swiping the thumb to move it and press it to make a selection. This change prevented problems including the accumulation of dust behind the <b>trackball.</b> Similarly to previous BlackBerry models, BlackBerry 9700 has a 35-key QWERTY-type physical keyboard, which is smaller than that of Bold 9000. On the top of the device, there are two buttons that respectively lock or mute it; {{on the right side of}} it, rubberized keys are found, which can either control the audio volume or the music player; further down, there is a camera shutter key. Cosmetic changes including the addition of a leatherette battery cover were carried out in order to appeal both sexes.|$|E
5|$|Marble Madness is an {{isometric}} platform game {{in which}} the player manipulates an onscreen marble from a third-person perspective. The player controls the marble's movements with a <b>trackball,</b> though most home versions use game controllers with directional pads. The aim {{of the game is}} for the player to complete six maze-like, isometric race courses before a set amount of time expires. With the exception of the first race, any time left on the clock {{at the end of a}} race is carried over to the next one, and the player is granted a set amount of additional time as well. The game allows two players to compete against each other, awarding bonus points and extra time to the winner of each race; both players have separate clocks.|$|E
5|$|When the {{computer}} was not in use, contents of the memory were preserved {{as long as the}} main lead-acid battery remained charged. The PowerBook100 Power Manager was an integrated circuit, usually placed on the logic board of a PowerBook, and was responsible for the power management of {{the computer}}. Identical to that of the Macintosh Portable, it controlled the display's backlight, hard drive spin-down, sleep and wake, battery charging, <b>trackball</b> control, and input/output (I/O). The 100 did add a new feature: 3.5V batteries backed up permanent and expansion random access memory (RAM) when the PowerBook100's battery was being replaced or when the 100 was otherwise temporarily removed from all power sources. This made it a perfect candidate for use with Apple's RAM disk to help increase battery life by accessing the hard disk less frequently, since the 100 was the only PowerBook that maintained the contents of RAM on shutdown in order to reduce startup time.|$|E

5000|$|Large <b>trackballs</b> {{are common}} on CAD {{workstations}} for easy precision. Before {{the advent of}} the touchpad, small <b>trackballs</b> were common on portable computers, where there may be no desk space on which to run a mouse. Some small [...] "thumbballs" [...] are designed to clip onto the side of the keyboard and have integral buttons with the same function as mouse buttons.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Trackballs.</b> For example, the Kensington Expert Mouse: A large track ball {{surrounded}} by a scroll ring.|$|R
25|$|Macintosh Portable: The Macintosh Portable was {{the first}} Apple machine to use a <b>trackball,</b> {{essentially}} a large palm-sized, upside-down ball mouse.|$|E
25|$|The Mighty Mouse is made {{of white}} plastic and has a {{recessed}} Apple logo on the mouse's face. The mouse has four functional controls: a left capacitive sensor, a right capacitive sensor, a track ball with a pressure sensor and side squeeze sensors. The track ball enables users to scroll a page or document in any direction, including diagonally. Instead of mechanical buttons, the touch-sensitive topshell (mentioned below) and the pressure sensing <b>trackball</b> allow the mouse to detect which side is being touched or whether the <b>trackball</b> is being held in.|$|E
25|$|Pippin controller: The Pippin, {{developed}} by Apple, had a gamepad {{with a built-in}} <b>trackball.</b> Versions were made which connected via the Pippin's AppleJack childproof ADB connector, infrared, and normal ADB.|$|E
50|$|Alliances score an {{additional}} 12 points {{for each of}} their <b>Trackballs</b> that are positioned anywhere on the overpass {{at the end of}} the match.|$|R
50|$|All {{of these}} actions require a {{physical}} device. Input devices range from the common - keyboards, mice, graphics tablets, <b>trackballs,</b> and touchpads - to the esoteric - wired gloves, boom arms, and even omnidirectional treadmills.|$|R
50|$|Now {{that the}} {{standard}} crossed company lines as well as markets, and it rapidly proliferated across the industry. Hundreds of new devices using the system cropped up over time, including <b>trackballs</b> and other advanced inputs.|$|R
25|$|PowerBook: The PowerBook line scaled {{down the}} <b>trackball</b> to be thumb-sized and {{included}} {{one in every}} portable from 1991 to 1995 when it was phased {{out in favor of}} the trackpad.|$|E
25|$|DATAR {{was similar}} in concept to Benjamin's display. The <b>trackball</b> used four disks {{to pick up}} motion, two each for the X and Y directions. Several rollers {{provided}} mechanical support. When the ball was rolled, the pickup discs spun and contacts on their outer rim made periodic contact with wires, producing pulses of output with each movement of the ball. By counting the pulses, the physical movement of the ball could be determined. A digital computer calculated the tracks and sent the resulting data to other ships in a task force using pulse-code modulation radio signals. This <b>trackball</b> used a standard Canadian five-pin bowling ball. It was not patented, {{since it was a}} secret military project.|$|E
25|$|A {{version of}} Pac-Man and Mrs. Pac-Man was {{released}} on the Galaxy Games multi-game cocktail table unit in 1998. The game differed from the original in that players controlled Pac-Man's movement with a <b>trackball</b> instead of a normal arcade joystick.|$|E
5000|$|The game unit {{consisted}} of two 3" [...] optical <b>trackballs.</b> These were made of semi-transparent plastic, illuminated from below such that they shined fairly brightly blue or red, depending on {{the color of the}} ball.|$|R
50|$|Rotary {{encoders}} {{are used}} in many applications that require precise shaft unlimited rotation - including industrial controls, robotics, special purpose photographic lenses, computer input devices (such as optomechanical mice and <b>trackballs),</b> controlled stress rheometers, and rotating radar platforms.|$|R
5000|$|Large <b>trackballs</b> are {{sometimes}} seen on computerized special-purpose workstations, {{such as the}} radar consoles in an air-traffic control room or sonar equipment on a ship or submarine. Modern installations of such equipment may use mice instead, since most people now already {{know how to use}} one. However, military mobile anti-aircraft radars, commercial airliners (such as Airbus A380) and submarine sonars tend to continue using <b>trackballs,</b> since they can be made more durable and more fit for fast emergency use. Large and well made ones allow easier high precision work, for which reason they may still be used in these applications (where they are often called [...] "tracker balls") and in computer-aided design.|$|R
25|$|A1152: Under {{increasing}} pressure {{to sell a}} generic two button mouse with a scroll wheel, Apple decided to develop a mouse (in 2005) with touchpad-like capacitive controls instead of buttons, and featured a tiny integrated <b>trackball</b> {{in place of a}} scrollwheel.|$|E
25|$|Another early <b>trackball</b> {{was built}} by British {{electrical}} engineer Kenyon Taylor in collaboration with Tom Cranston and Fred Longstaff. Taylor {{was part of the}} original Ferranti Canada, working on the Royal Canadian Navy's DATAR (Digital Automated Tracking and Resolving) system in 1952.|$|E
25|$|Human {{interface}} devices, for {{the efficient}} interaction with a GUI include a computer keyboard, especially used together with keyboard shortcuts, pointing devices for the cursor (or rather pointer) control: mouse, pointing stick, touchpad, <b>trackball,</b> joystick, virtual keyboards, and head-up displays (translucent information devices at the eye level).|$|E
50|$|<b>Trackballs</b> are {{generally}} either thumb-operated, {{with a ball}} about an inch in diameter or smaller moved by one digit (almost always the thumb) and the buttons clicked by others, or finger-operated, with a ball over two inches in diameter operated by the middle fingers and the buttons by the thumb and little finger. Users favour one format or another for reasons of comfort, mobility, precision, or because it reduces strain on {{one part of the}} hand/wrist. Most, but not all, finger-operated designs are symmetrical in design, making them usable by both hands, while thumb-operated designs are by their nature asymmetric or “handed,” allowing the smallest examples to be held in the air. Thumb-operated <b>trackballs</b> are not generally available in left-handed configurations, due to small demand.|$|R
50|$|Because <b>trackballs</b> for {{personal}} computers are stationary, they may require less space for operation than a mouse, and may simplify use in confined or cluttered {{areas such as}} a small desk or a rack-mounted terminal. They are generally preferred in laboratory setting for the same reason.|$|R
2500|$|The ship's Common Display System is nicknamed [...] "keds": Sailors operate keds via <b>trackballs</b> and {{specialized}} button panels, with {{the option to}} the interface by using touchscreens. The technology array allows sailors to monitor multiple weapons systems or sensors, saving manpower, and allowing it to be steered from the ops center.|$|R
25|$|Nearly all mice {{now have}} an {{integrated}} input primarily intended for scrolling on top, usually a single-axis digital wheel or rocker switch which can also be depressed {{to act as a}} third button. Though less common, many mice instead have two-axis inputs such as a tiltable wheel, <b>trackball,</b> or touchpad.|$|E
25|$|The Apple Mouse (formerly Apple Mighty Mouse) is a multi-control USB mouse {{manufactured}} by Mitsumi Electric and sold by Apple Inc. It was announced and sold {{for the first}} time on August 2, 2005, and a Bluetooth version was available from 2006 to 2009. Before the Mighty Mouse, Apple had sold only one-button mice with its computers, beginning with the Apple Lisa 22 years earlier. The Mighty Mouse supported two buttons, and a miniature <b>trackball</b> for scrolling.|$|E
25|$|To {{address the}} {{mechanical}} reliability issues {{seen in the}} X2, in 1953 the NRL adapted their CDS to store data using capacitors instead of the potentiometers, a change that would later be copied by the production CDS. This left the input consoles as the only major moving parts. They further modified their units by replacing the <b>trackball</b> with an electrically conductive sheet of glass which the user pressed on with a metal probe. The assembly was then placed {{on top of the}} otherwise unchanged input station display.|$|E
