5|$|I am not <b>too</b> <b>sure</b> if John {{actually}} {{fully understood}} what he was saying. He knew he was onto something when he saw those words and turned them into a song. But to have experienced what the lyrics in that song are actually about? I don't know if he fully understood it.|$|E
5|$|What then is {{the spirit}} of liberty? I cannot define it; I {{can only tell you}} my own faith. The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not <b>too</b> <b>sure</b> that it is right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to {{understand}} the minds of other men and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who, near two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; {{that there may be a}} kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest.|$|E
25|$|You've {{heard about}} the 1905 flood, when the Colorado River spilled over and formed the Salton Sea? But don't be <b>too</b> <b>sure</b> about quakes; valleys below sea level don't just grow—something has to cause them. The San Andreas Fault curls around this valley like a {{question}} mark. Just imagine the shake-up it must have taken to drop thousands of square miles {{below the level of}} the Pacific.|$|E

500|$|Mallowan {{noted that}} [...] "Immediate and swift {{presentation}} of results {{was more important to}} him than profound scholarship, although his critical sense made him conscious that it was necessary to maintain high standards and he would approve of nothing that was slipshod." [...] Jacquetta Hawkes commented that he made errors in his interpretation of the archaeological evidence because he was [...] "sometimes <b>too</b> <b>sure</b> of being right, too ready to accept his own authority". She asserted that while Wheeler was not an original thinker, he had [...] "a vision of human history that enabled him to see each discovery of its traces, however small, in its widest significance." ...|$|E
500|$|Doby {{was elected}} into the National Baseball Hall of Fame on March 3, 1998, by the Veterans Committee {{at the age}} of 74. [...] "This is just a {{tremendous}} feeling. It's kind of like a bale of cotton has been on your shoulders, and now it's off", said Doby. When he received word about his election it was via telephone call from fellow Hall member Ted Williams. Upon hearing of Doby's election, Gene Mauch, said, [...] "You have {{to be some kind of}} special person to go through what Larry and Jackie Robinson went through. They both are. I'm not <b>too</b> <b>sure</b> there's a player in the game today who could handle it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elma Farnsworth: We were {{watching}} it, and, when Neil Armstrong {{landed on the}} moon, Phil {{turned to me and}} said, [...] "Pem, this has made it all worthwhile." [...] Before then, he wasn't <b>too</b> <b>sure.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I never did!" [...] Mrs. Foulton exclaimed in amazement. [...] "Him offend Miss Thorpe-Hatton! So nice-spoken he is, <b>too.</b> I'm <b>sure</b> I can't imagine his {{saying a}} wry word to anybody." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And in character, <b>too.</b> I'm <b>sure</b> you'd find, if {{you were}} to try her, that she has all his {{personal}} firmness, though she can't show it as he does by kicking out his feet and clenching his fist." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you haven't {{told me it}} wasn't. All the same, I'll be there. And I'll {{take you}} home, <b>too.</b> Be <b>sure</b> an' keep plenty of round dances open fer me. That's right. Get mad. It makes you look fine." ...|$|R
2500|$|In his autobiography, he {{admitted}} to hundreds of sexual liaisons and affairs, including one with a transsexual, but claimed that he only undertook this course of action because his first wife was unfaithful. His lovers before his second marriage included the actress Diana Dors, about whose parties he later commented after her death: [...] "The awkward part about an orgy, is that afterwards you're not <b>too</b> <b>sure</b> who to thank." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of the jury, {{two members}} {{held out the}} first vote we took, but 10 of us were sure Ryan was guilty. He was a bit <b>too</b> <b>sure</b> of himself in the witness box {{but the thing that}} decided us was {{handling}} the rifle which had killed Hodson. We had been told the rifle had a hair trigger, but when we examined it we found we had to pull it at least half an inch and use quite a bit of force." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{aspect of}} Objectivist poetics {{that is not}} {{explicitly}} addressed in these essays is an interest in exploiting the resonances of small, everyday words. As Zukofsky was to write some time later (in 1946), [...] "a {{case can be made}} for the poet giving some of his life {{to the use of the}} words the and a: both of which are weighted with as much epos and historical destiny as one man can perhaps resolve. Those who do not believe this are <b>too</b> <b>sure</b> that the little words mean nothing among so many other words." [...] This concern is also reflected in Oppen's statement [...] "if we still possessed the word 'is', there would be no need to write poems".|$|E

[...] "Nellie, and Dora <b>too,</b> as <b>sure</b> as fate!" [...] he ejaculated. [...] "Something has happened to them! Perhaps those horses are running away!" ...|$|R
2500|$|In the end, he {{was almost}} <b>too</b> <b>sure</b> of himself. He was quoted as saying, [...] "They will write books and make movies about my time here." [...] His 1995 team started out well, {{reaching}} the top 10 after a 3–0 start. However, an embarrassing loss to Colorado on national television started a downward spiral. The Sooners ultimately finished 5–5–1, including only their second losing conference record since World War II. Schnellenberger resigned {{a month after the}} season ended. To this day, Schnellenberger is not held in high esteem by Sooner fans, in part because he made no secret of his lack of interest in the program's history. For instance, he vowed to make [...] "Sooner Nation" [...] forget about Wilkinson and Switzer—a boast considered to be almost heretical by the fan base. He ordered numerous old files to be thrown out; instead, they were archived without his knowledge.|$|E
2500|$|After {{failing to}} climb over the mountains, the Fellowship passed eastward through Moria, the former [...] realm of the Dwarves, where Gandalf {{fell into a deep}} abyss while {{fighting}} a Balrog. After the skirmish in Moria, Aragorn became their new guide, and they {{made their way to the}} Elven realm of Lothlórien. Boromir was unnerved by the thought of entering the elvish forest—he pleads with Aragorn to find another way [...] "though it led through a hedge of swords", citing the stories of elvish witchcraft he had heard about in Gondor, and the [...] "strange paths" [...] they had been taking which had already caused them to lose one Companion. [...] Once in Lórien, Boromir was greatly disturbed by the Lady Galadriel's testing of his mind; he told Aragorn [...] "not to be <b>too</b> <b>sure</b> of this lady and her purposes." [...] When Boromir left Lórien, he received the gifts of a golden belt and an Elven-cloak.|$|E

It would be too bad if we had to march right across Europe and back without firing a shot, but I, who know the Russians <b>too,</b> feel <b>sure</b> that that will never be." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And I, <b>too,</b> am <b>sure</b> of it, Mr. Fox," [...] cried Dorothy; {{clapping}} her hands. [...] "Persuade {{him to stay}} awhile in London, {{that you}} may have him at your next theatricals at Holland House. Why, he knows Shakespeare and Pope and--and Chaucer by heart, and Ovid and Horace,--is it not so, Mr. Walpole?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think so, <b>too.</b> I am <b>sure</b> I hope so. Because you {{remember}} what the ride to Long Valley did to Miss Spencer," [...] rejoined Glenn.|$|R
5000|$|Despite this, MTV Multiplayer {{said that}} players [...] "might {{not want to}} write off Major League Eating: The Game <b>too</b> quickly. <b>Sure,</b> it’s a game based entirely on eating, but it is {{actually}} surprisingly fun to virtually scarf down quantities of food so large that the average human body would most likely {{not be able to}} digest." ...|$|R

'Oh, but you MUST be,' Edie replied confidently; 'and a {{great deal}} cleverer, <b>too,</b> I'm <b>sure.</b> I know you must, because Harry {{told me you were}} one of the very cleverest men in the whole 'Varsity.
