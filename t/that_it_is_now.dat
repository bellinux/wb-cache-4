5|$|Eremoryzomys polius, {{also known}} as the gray rice rat or the Marañon oryzomys, is a rodent species in the tribe Oryzomyini of the family Cricetidae. Discovered in 1912 and first {{described}} in 1913 by Wilfred Osgood, it was originally placed in Oryzomys and named Oryzomys polius. In 2006, a cladistic analysis found that it was not closely related to Oryzomys in the strict sense or to any other oryzomyine then known, so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> placed in its own genus, Eremoryzomys. The Brazilian genus Drymoreomys, named in 2011, is probably the closest relative of Eremoryzomys. Eremoryzomys has a limited distribution in the dry upper valley of the Marañón River in central Peru, but may yet contain more than one species.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Marcelo Weksler {{published}} a phylogenetic analysis of Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), the tribe to which Oryzomys is allocated, using morphological and DNA sequence data. His results showed species of Oryzomys dispersed across Oryzomyini {{and suggested that}} most species in the genus should be allocated to new genera. Later in the same year, he, together with Alexandre Percequillo and Robert Voss, named ten new genera for these species, including Transandinomys, which has Oryzomys talamancae (now Transandinomys talamancae) as its type species. They also included Oryzomys bolivaris in Transandinomys, so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> named Transandinomys bolivaris, although {{it had not been}} included in Weksler's phylogenetic study. The two species are morphologically similar, but they could identify only one synapomorphy (shared-derived trait) for them: very long superciliary vibrissae (whiskers above the eyes). Transandinomys is one of about 30 genera in Oryzomyini, a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.|$|E
5|$|In the TARDIS, the Doctor {{agrees to}} take Rose {{to the day}} her father died {{so that she can}} be there when it happens. Upon their arrival in London on Saturday 7 November 1987, they witness the {{accident}}, but Rose is unable to move when the Doctor tells her to go comfort her dying father. Rose asks the Doctor if she can try again, and the Doctor allows it but warns Rose to not run until their former selves have left to prevent a paradox. As the accident is about to happen, Rose suddenly runs out and pushes Pete aside, saving his life. The younger versions of the Doctor and Rose vanish. Rose and the Doctor fight about her actions, with the Doctor rebuking her for potentially damaging the timeline. The Doctor takes Rose's TARDIS key back and storms off without her. Rose decides to go with Pete to the wedding, while the Doctor walks back to the TARDIS only to find <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> an empty shell. Strange flying beasts called Reapers appear and begin consuming people.|$|E

5|$|Pericles {{runs into}} {{the wreck of the}} Oberon and Leo runs after him, {{followed}} by General Thade. Thade and Leo fight. Pericles tries to help Leo, but Thade throws him hard against a wall. Thade takes Leo's gun from him and tries to fire the weapon at Leo. Leo sees that Thade is within the pilot's deck and closes the automatic door, trapping Thade inside. Thade fires the weapon repeatedly at the door but the ricochets create sparks that cause Thade to huddle afraid under a control panel. Leo decides to escape the Planet of the Apes and return to Earth. He gives Pericles to Ari, who promises to look after him. He says goodbye and kisses Ari and Daena. Leo climbs aboard Pericles's undamaged pod and travels back in time through the same electromagnetic storm. Leo crashes in Washington, D.C. on Earth. He looks up at {{what appears to be the}} Lincoln Memorial, only to find <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> a monument to General Thade. A swarm of police officers, firefighters, and news reporters descend on Leo, all of whom are apes.|$|E
5|$|The {{bramble shark}} {{is not known}} to pose a danger to humans. It is caught {{incidentally}} by commercial fisheries in bottom trawls and on fishing line, {{as well as by}} sport anglers. In the eastern Atlantic, this species is processed into fishmeal but has little commercial significance. Its liver oil is highly valued in South Africa as medicine, whereas in India the oil is considered poor and is used to coat canoes to discourage woodboring beetles. Historical accounts suggest that bramble shark numbers in the northeastern Atlantic have fallen markedly since the 18th and 19th centuries, such as <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> extremely rare off northern Europe and in the Mediterranean. This decline has been attributed to fishing pressure, to which this species may be highly vulnerable as large, deep-sea sharks generally have slow growth rates and long lifespans. Regarding the species as a whole, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lacks sufficient data for an assessment beyond Data Deficient.|$|E

25|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{history of the}} passerine families and the relationships among them remained rather mysterious until the late 20th century.

For example, the wrens of the Americas and Eurasia; those of Australia; and those of New Zealand look superficially similar and behave in similar ways, and yet belong to three far-flung branches of the passerine family tree; they are as unrelated as it is possible to be while remaining Passeriformes.|$|E
