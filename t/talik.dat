As a result of the long-term evolution of permafrost within the rift zones, pocket-like (dome-shaped) structures similar to anticlines have been formed at the base of permafrost as well as open endogenic subsea <b>taliks.</b> It is assumed, that the anticlinal structures act as traps for sub-permafrost gases and their hydrates, whereas the open <b>taliks</b> serve as channels for their emission.

Various temporal and spatial surface temperature conditions are considered to control the initial permafrost distributions for the simulations. The simulated rates of increase in groundwater contribution to streamflow during and after permafrost thaw, are in the order of magnitude comparable to hydrogeological regime changes over the past decades as reported for several (sub-) Arctic rivers. The simulations further show that two distinct features of the subsurface response control the temporal evolution of base flow increase: (1) shifts in aquifer permeability architecture during permafrost degradation and (2) uptake of water into aquifer storage when sub-permafrost hydraulic heads rise. Model analysis shows that the latter process delays base flow increase by several decades to centuries.

Shallow lakes freeze to the bed, thus preventing permafrost thaw underneath them and limiting {{the length of the}} period with greenhouse gas production in the unfrozen lake sediments. Radar remote sensing permits to distinguish lakes with bedfast ice due to the difference in backscatter intensities from bedfast and floating ice. This study investigates the potential of a unique time series of three-year repeat-pass TerraSAR-X (TSX) imagery with high temporal (11 days) and spatial (10 m) resolution for monitoring bedfast ice as well as ice phenology of lakes in the zone of continuous permafrost in the Lena River Delta, Siberia. TSX backscatter intensity is shown to be an excellent tool for monitoring floating versus bedfast lake ice as well as ice phenology. TSX-derived timing of ice grounding and the ice growth model CLIMo are used to retrieve the ice thicknesses of the bedfast ice at points where in situ ice thickness measurements were available. Comparison shows good agreement in the year of field measurements. Additionally, for the first time, an 11 -day sequential interferometric coherence time series is analyzed as a supplementary approach for the bedfast ice monitoring. The coherence time series detects most of the ice grounding as well as spring snow/ice melt onset.

These landforms include moraines, drumlinized features, glacigenic debris flows, till wedges, mega-scale glacial lineations (MSGL), and iceberg plough marks. Orientations {{of some of the}} landforms suggest the presence of former ice sheets on the Chukchi Borderland and the East Siberian shelf. In seismic and sub-bottom profiles as well as sediment cores, there is evidence that glaciations have occurred repeatedly. Typically, several generations of glacial wedges intercalate with well-stratified (interglacial) sediments in ice-distal locations. MSGL of former ice grounding in present water depths of more than 1200 m suggests that some ice sheets developed significant thickness and size. The extent of glacial features and deposits into the Arctic Ocean decreased with time. We interpret this as indication that ice sheets in the western Arctic Ocean were thicker and larger during earlier times of the Pleistocene and became restricted to the Chukchi Borderland during the most recent glaciation (Last Glacial Maximum, LGM). Finally, icebergs intensively ploughed the sediments along the Chukchi and East Siberian margin in a range from 350 m to 80 m present water depth. In water depth shallower than 80 m, sub-bottom profiles in the East Siberian Sea exhibit acoustic facies more typical for submarine permafrost. Discontinuous (permafrost) reflectors mask sub-bottom strata beneath an unfrozen 10 m thick top sediment layer. In places, unfrozen sediment-filled depressions (<b>taliks)</b> are visible to about 20 m below the seafloor, which may be related to former thermokarst and/or channels.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2005 Over {{the past}} fifty years Alaska has {{experienced}} {{an increase in}} mean annual temperature. This warming may be causing significant changes in hydrology and permafrost dynamics. In recent decades, Native Americans and land managers have reported losses of water bodies and surface water area in interior Alaska. We conducted a study to determine the degree to which these informal observations were representative of a regional trend in surface water area loss. This study examines closed-basin water bodies in nine regions across Alaska: 1) Copper River Basin, 2) Talkeetna, 3) Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge, 4) Denali National Park, 5) Innoko Flats National Wildlife Refuge, 6) Minto Flats State Game Refuge, 7) Stevens Village, 8) Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge, and 9) Prudhoe Bay/Arctic Coastal Plain. The study included approximately 850, 000 hectares and over 40, 000 water bodies. To conduct such a large-scale study, GIS and Remote Sensing techniques were applied. Water body change detection was conducted over a fifty-year time period. A minimum of three time periods were used for each area. Imagery included black and white aerial photography (1950 - 1957), color infrared aerial photography (1978 - 1982), Landsat TM (1986 - 1995), and Landsat ETM+ (1999 - 2002). Based on these images, water body polygons were digitized for each time period. Area was calculated for each polygon and compared to corresponding ponds from images at later times. Of the nine regions, six showed substantial reductions in surface water area: Copper River Basin, Minto Flats, Innoko Flats, Yukon Flats, Stevens Village, and Denali National Park. The Innoko Flats and Copper River Basin regions showed the most loss at 31 % and 28 % respectively.

However, {{little is known about}} their distribution, how and under what conditions they form, and how their intriguing morphology translates to ecosystem functions and habitat. Here we report on a circum-Arctic survey of beaded streams and a watershed-scale analysis in northern Alaska using remote sensing and field studies. We mapped over 400 channel networks with beaded morphology throughout the continuous permafrost zone of northern Alaska, Canada, and Russia and found the highest abundance associated with medium to high ground-ice content permafrost in moderately sloping terrain. In one Arctic coastal plain watershed, beaded streams accounted for half of the drainage density, occurring primarily as low-order channels initiating from lakes and drained lake basins. Beaded streams predictably transition to alluvial channels with increasing drainage area and decreasing channel slope, although this transition is modified by local controls on water and sediment delivery. The comparisons of one beaded channel using repeat photography between 1948 and 2013 indicate a relatively stable landform, and 14 C dating of basal sediments suggest channel formation may be as early as the Pleistocene–Holocene transition. Contemporary processes, such as deep snow accumulation in riparian zones, effectively insulate channel ice and allows for perennial liquid water below most beaded stream pools. Because of this, mean annual temperatures in pool beds are greater than 2 °C, leading to the development of perennial thaw bulbs or <b>taliks</b> underlying these thermokarst features that range from 0. 7 to 1. 6 m. In the summer, some pools thermally stratify, which reduces permafrost thaw and maintains cold-water habitats. Snowmelt-generated peak flows decrease rapidly by two or more orders of magnitude to summer low flows with slow reach-scale velocity distributions ranging from 0. 01 to 0. 1 m s − 1, yet channel runs still move water rapidly between pools.

It accounts for density driven advection, wind induced mixing, absorption of light and turbulent fluxes at the water surface. Model results were validated with field data from long term measurement stations on Samoylov Island in the Lena River Delta. Simulation results reproduced the most important features of the thermal dynamics of Arctic ponds. Shortcomings in the representation of snow cover indicated the great importance of including time varying snow thermal properties due to metamorphosis processes of snow. Long term simulations of the thermal regime below water bodies showed that there is a threshold behaviour with respect to <b>talik</b> development. A 10 - 20 cm increase in water body depth evoked the sudden appearance of a <b>talik.</b> <b>Talik</b> formation was possible within the course of 2 - 3 consecutive years if winter conditions were comparably warm or featured a thick snow cover. The development of <b>talik</b> is triggered by the succession of these short term events rather than by long term air temperature increase. The presented model enhances our knowledge about the susceptibility of permafrost below shallow water bodies. ...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{forest fires}} {{occurred}} {{during the summer of}} 2004 in the Klondike Goldfields region of the Yukon Territory, an area of extensive discontinuous permafrost. More than 35 shallow detachment failure landslides developed in subsequent weeks in Steele Creek, a small drainage basin located about 60 km south of Dawson City. Preliminary observations of the failures and near-surface thermal regime were made through freeze-up of 2004 and continued in the summers of 2005 and 2006. Detachment failures were mapped and individual sites were surveyed. Air and ground temperatures were measured in burned and unburned areas. In addition, two-dimensional DC resistivity transects were used to examine subsurface conditions in the area. Forest fire contributed to detachment failure activity on permafrost slopes by destroying the surface organic mat, causing burned surface temperatures to rise, thawing active layers by up to 20 cm (+ 31 %) deeper than unburned slopes and weakening the surface root structures. Deeper thaw melted transient layer ground ice, raising soil porewater pressures. The thermal differences between burned and unburned sites were greater at the north-facing than south-facing sites, and active layer freezing and thawing processes varied according to both aspect and burned status. More southerly-facing and/or burned sites generally thawed earlier, refroze later and had warmer temperatures than more northerly and/or unburned sites. Thaw of burned areas with high ground surface temperatures can be expected to continue, depending on climatic conditions, until sufficient revegetation occurs to shade the surface and rebuild the insulating organic mat. The detachment failures occurred from a few weeks to two years after forest fire, and only on slopes where permafrost was extensive. They were not similar to others in the literature in that almost all occurred in coarse-gained soils and had failure planes elevated above the permafrost table. These landslides were flow-type failures that rafted portions of the organic mat on top of deforming, non-cohesive sediment. They occurred in areas of deeper thaw but their distribution and the resistivity data suggest that they were associated with supra-permafrost <b>taliks</b> which concentrated groundwater flow. In an unglaciated area like the Klondike region this landsliding process has likely occurred thousands of times during the Pleistocene and may be responsible for elements of the form of the region's slopes. Predicted increases in the frequency and magnitude of forest fire in the boreal forest due to warming climates may increase incidence of these types of failures...|$|R
40|$|Permafrost {{temperatures}} {{were measured}} by the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) in 1977 - 1981 at boreholes along a proposed pipeline route in the southern Yukon. Analysis of climate station records indicate that mean annual air temperatures {{in the region have}} since increased by 0. 5 - 1. 0 ˚C. Renewed interest in the pipeline and the need to develop adaptation strategies for existing highway infrastructure have meant that information on permafrost and geotechnical conditions must be updated. To accomplish this goal, a total of eight GSC boreholes ranging in depth from 5 - 9 m were located, unblocked of ice and instrumented with thermistor cables and data-loggers to permit renewed ground temperature monitoring. Manual temperature measurements were also taken at four other shallow boreholes. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys were conducted at each site. MAGTs below 1 m at permafrost sites in the study area range from - 0. 2 ˚C to - 1. 5 ˚C with permafrost depths greater than 25 m. The permafrost at the study sites can be classified as sporadic discontinuous and extensive discontinuous. Ground temperatures indicate that permafrost can persist under warmer climatic conditions as long as it remains protected by its ecosystem properties. Thermal monitoring for 2011 - 2012 shows an average increase of 0. 5 - 1. 0 ˚C when compared to the original 1978 - 1981 ground temperatures. This slow rate of ground warming is mainly attributed to a combination of limited climate change, especially in the south of the study area, ground temperatures close to 0 ˚C, and the possible disturbance of sites from the removal of vegetation prior to the original measurements being made. ERT surveys conducted at most borehole sites show deeper thaw or <b>taliks</b> where the cleared cut-line used for geophysical work in the 1970 s is crossed. These results indicate the impacts of climate change and environmental change in the study area over the past three decades. They appear to match the relatively slow rates of ground warming observed elsewhere in northern Canada where permafrost temperatures are close to 0 ˚C and where warming also requires changes in latent heat due to internal thaw. TTOP equilibrium modelling suggests that if climate change is responsible for the ground warming, most of the change {{can be attributed to the}} step-like MAAT increase that occurred between 1975 - 1976...|$|R
40|$|Soils {{and other}} unconsolidated {{deposits}} {{in the northern}} circumpolar permafrost region store large amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC). This SOC is potentially vulnerable to remobilization following soil warming and permafrost thaw, but SOC stock estimates were poorly constrained and quantitative error estimates were lacking. This study presents revised estimates of permafrost SOC stocks, including quantitative uncertainty estimates, in the 0 – 3 m depth range in soils {{as well as for}} sediments deeper than 3 m in deltaic deposits of major rivers and in the Yedoma region of Siberia and Alaska. Revised estimates are based on significantly larger databases compared to previous studies. Despite this there is evidence of significant remaining regional data gaps. Estimates remain particularly poorly constrained for soils in the High Arctic region and physiographic regions with thin sedimentary overburden (mountains, highlands and plateaus) as well as for deposits below 3 m depth in deltas and the Yedoma region. While some components of the revised SOC stocks are similar in magnitude to those previously reported for this region, there are substantial differences in other components, including the fraction of perennially frozen SOC. Upscaled based on regional soil maps, estimated permafrost region SOC stocks are 217 ± 12 and 472 ± 27 Pg for the 0 – 0. 3 and 0 – 1 m soil depths, respectively (± 95 % confidence intervals). Storage of SOC in 0 – 3 m of soils is estimated to 1035 ± 150 Pg. Of this, 34 ± 16 Pg C is stored in poorly developed soils of the High Arctic. Based on generalized calculations, storage of SOC below 3 m of surface soils in deltaic alluvium of major Arctic rivers is estimated as 91 ± 52 Pg. In the Yedoma region, estimated SOC stocks below 3 m depth are 181 ± 54 Pg, of which 74 ± 20 Pg is stored in intact Yedoma (late Pleistocene ice- and organic-rich silty sediments) with the remainder in refrozen thermokarst deposits. Total estimated SOC storage for the permafrost region is ∼ 1300 Pg with an uncertainty range of ∼ 1100 to 1500 Pg. Of this, ∼ 500 Pg is in non-permafrost soils, seasonally thawed in the active layer or in deeper <b>taliks,</b> while ∼ 800 Pg is perennially frozen. This represents a substantial ∼ 300 Pg lowering of the estimated perennially frozen SOC stock compared to previous estimates...|$|R
