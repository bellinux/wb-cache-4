50|$|The {{selection}} of patterns {{assumes that the}} user does not know the encoding mechanism used by the drive, so it includes patterns designed specifically for three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>drives.</b> A user who knows which <b>type</b> <b>of</b> encoding the <b>drive</b> uses can choose only those patterns intended for their drive. A drive with a different encoding mechanism would need different patterns.|$|R

40|$|The {{theme of}} this masters thesis are driven chaotic {{oscillator}}s. The aim of this project is show the various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>driven</b> chaotic oscillator and propose mathematical model solutions using numerical methods. In {{the first part of}} this thesis are shown theory of chaos, history of chaos theory, chaotic systems and chaos quantifiers. Next is numerical analysis of differential equations second order by Runge-Kutta fourth order method. Next part contains circuit blocks and synthesis of oscillators. In next part are defined all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> oscillators. Parameters of analysis, equations, circuits and simulations are defined for each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>driven</b> chaotic oscillators. In each subchapter is design electrical circuit. This circuit is simulated and some of them realized...|$|R
2500|$|Note {{that bit}} number 1 is unused {{and that the}} [...] "Unknown" [...] type is {{represented}} twice. Setting all bits to 1 would give a hexadecimal value of 0xFF, decimal 255, and would disable AutoRun on all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>drives.</b>|$|R
5000|$|However, this {{arrangement}} was later revised {{so that each}} unit adopted the class number previously given just to the main <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>Driving</b> Motor car (the exception being the DEMU units, which were completely changed).

5000|$|Whilst the new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>drive</b> using Klien-Lindner axles {{allowed the}} eight-coupled engines to {{negotiate}} tight curves, {{in the end}} the new Class V K proved just as complicated and maintenance-intensive as the tried and tested IV K.|$|E
5000|$|The Micro User also {{published}} an article on creating dual-format discs, with 21 tracks' worth of data stored in both formats so that either <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>drive</b> could access the contents; however these had limited capacity and once created were read-only; ...|$|E
50|$|Blowing {{machines}} are classified {{with regard to}} the diameter of the cable they can handle and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>drive</b> system (track feeder, roller feeder, belt feeder or blowing heads without feeders). The optical fiber cable blowing machine are of 2 types.|$|E
50|$|By 1990, SCSI had matured {{enough to}} handle high data rates and {{multiple}} <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>drives,</b> and ATA was quickly overtaking ST-506 in the desktop market. These two events made ESDI less and less important over time, and by the mid-1990s, ESDI {{was no longer in}} common use.|$|R
50|$|There are two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> {{mechanical}} <b>drives,</b> {{variable pitch}} drives and traction drives.|$|R

50|$|The Melville {{was used}} in the 1976 movie King Kong, {{starring}} Jessica Lange and Jeff Bridges. It was used specifically because of its Hypoid propulsion drive (at that time), which allowed it to move sideways. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>drive</b> is used, on research vessels, for station keeping in the ocean over drill and coring sites.|$|E
50|$|A {{spacecraft}} {{could carry}} a mass driver as its primary engine. With a suitable source of electrical power (probably a nuclear reactor) the spaceship could {{then use the}} mass driver to accelerate pieces of matter of almost any sort, boosting itself in the opposite direction. At the smallest scale of reaction mass, this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>drive</b> is called an ion drive.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze the {{possibility}} of mechanical design platform lifts. Proposal lifting platform with mechanical and hydraulic drive with a capacity of 3500 kg and lift 600 mm. The work is mainly focused on design and strength calculation mechanism and structure. Proposal hydraulic circuits and the development drawings for both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>drive...</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} <b>types</b> <b>of</b> {{hydraulic}} <b>drives,</b> those are : hydrostatic drives, hydrodynamic drives and hydroviscous drives.|$|R
30|$|Besides Liu {{integral}}, Yao integral {{was introduced}} by [21] which is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> uncertain integral <b>driven</b> by uncertain renewal process. Chen [6] has also defined a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> uncertain integral <b>driven</b> by uncertain finite variation process.|$|R
50|$|Like the two S 2/5 {{express train}} {{locomotives}} also imported from Baldwin {{a year later}} these engines were equipped with a four-cylinder Vauclain compound engine, on which the high-pressure and low-pressure cylinders were located directly one above the other and worked on the same connecting rods. Apart from the bar frame, this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>drive</b> did not catch on in Bavaria.|$|E
50|$|Most often, {{the power}} is {{conveyed}} by a roller chain, known as the drive chain or transmission chain, passing over a sprocket gear, with {{the teeth of the}} gear meshing with the holes in the links of the chain. The gear is turned, and this pulls the chain putting mechanical force into the system. Another <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>drive</b> chain is the Morse chain, invented by the Morse Chain Company of Ithaca, New York, United States. This has inverted teeth.|$|E
50|$|The {{hard drive}} {{typically}} {{found in a}} Time Capsule is the Hitachi Deskstar, which is sold by Hitachi as a consumer-grade product—the Hitachi Ultrastar is the enterprise version. Apple labeled the drive as a server-grade drive in promotional material for Time Capsule, and also used this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>drive</b> in its discontinued Xserve servers. Apple states that the Hitachi Deskstar meets or exceeds the 1 million hours {{mean time between failures}} (MTBF) recommendation for server-grade hard drives.|$|E

40|$|A {{straightforward}} plotting {{technique for}} analyzing geopressured gas reservoirs permits the easily obtained production-pressure {{values and the}} requisite Z factors to be the input data. The outcome variables are original gas in place and an estimate of formation compressibility and water influx. The shape of the solution plot provides vlues as to the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>drive</b> mechanisms present in the reservoir. ...|$|R
50|$|Version 6 is {{different}} from previous versions. It offers full access to the entire disk surface regardless of partitioning, Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology (S.M.A.R.T.) parameters and control of partial scanning within a specified percentage range. Version 5 was limited to AT Attachment (PATA, IDE) hard drives; version 6 may, on suitable motherboards, work on newer Serial ATA (SATA) and USB hard drives, and with any other <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>drive</b> - SCSI, 1394/Firewire - {{that can be made}} visible to MS-DOS through the addition of controller BIOS or add-on DOS drivers.|$|E
50|$|When a user inserts {{an optical}} disc into a drive or {{attaches}} a USB camera, Windows detects the arrival and starts {{a process of}} examining the device or searching the medium. It is looking for properties of the device or content on the medium so that AutoPlay can present a set of meaningful options to the user. When the user makes a particular choice, they also {{have the option to}} make that selection automatic the next time Windows sees that content or device. The content types available vary with the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>drive</b> selected.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{incompatibility}} between 40- and 80-track drives, much {{software was}} distributed on combined 40/80-track disks. These work by writing {{the same data}} in pairs of consecutive tracks in 80-track format, and including a small loader program on track 1 (which {{is in the same}} physical position in either format). The loader program detects which <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>drive</b> is in use, and loads the main software program straight from disk bypassing the DFS, double-stepping for 80-track drives and single-stepping for 40-track. This effectively achieves downgraded capacity to 100 KB from either disk format, but enabled distributed software to be effectively compatible with either drive.|$|E
