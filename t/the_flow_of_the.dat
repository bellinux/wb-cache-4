5|$|Just {{outside the}} main walls, the castle mills had become {{increasingly}} ineffective from the 16th century onwards {{because of a}} reduction in <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rivers driving the water-wheels. As a result, in 1778 they were rebuilt with a new steam engine to drive the machinery; this steam engine caused considerable discomfort to the prisoners affected by the smoke and noise.|$|E

5|$|The {{climate of}} the Itcha Range is {{influenced}} by the presence of the Coast Mountains to the west, which disrupt <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prevailing westerly winds and causes them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the Coast Mountains before reaching the Interior Plateau, casting a rain shadow over the Itcha Range.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river has {{decreased}} {{in power in}} recent years, partly because of surface run-off in the upper catchment of the Hazel Brook, especially from the large retail centre at Cribbs Causeway, which sends {{a good deal of}} silt into the system, slowing the flow and creating a risk of flooding downstream. This problem has now been partially alleviated by the construction of the Catbrain attenuation reservoir near Cribbs Causeway. Measurements of pollution by the city council show the water to be relatively clean.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>flow</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mud <b>flow</b> was {{significantly}} higher than <b>the</b> production rate <b>of</b> artificial hot spring in the valley (<[*] 0.06  m 3 /s). <b>The</b> high <b>flow</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mud <b>flow</b> thus cannot be attributed to <b>the</b> rupture <b>of</b> plumbing systems of artificial hot springs in the upper stream. Since no heavy rainfall was observed before or during the eruption, and <b>the</b> usual <b>flow</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stream (~[*] 0.1  m 3 /s) is much lower than <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mud <b>flow,</b> <b>the</b> mud <b>flow</b> seems to have been derived by the eruption directly from the vent.|$|R
5|$|The game itself {{continued}} to evolve during this time.

5|$|The spring {{still exists}} {{and is now}} the site of a small modern pumping station. Its water is pure but high in {{dissolved}} calcium carbonate leached out of the surrounding limestone. This presented the Romans with significant problems in maintaining the aqueduct, as the carbonates precipitated out of the water during its journey through the conduit. This caused <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aqueduct to become progressively reduced by deposits of calcareous sinter. Another threat was posed by vegetation penetrating the stone lid of the channel. As well as obstructing <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water, dangling roots introduced algae and bacteria that decomposed in a process called biolithogenesis, producing concretions within the conduit. It required constant maintenance by circitores, workers responsible for the aqueduct's upkeep, who crawled along the conduit scrubbing the walls clean and removing any vegetation.|$|E

5|$|The woman's {{left ear}} is set, {{according}} to art historian Norbert Schneider, unnaturally high and far back, parallel {{to her eyes}} rather than to her nose; this position is probably an artistic device used to continue <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diagonal line of the veil's inner-right wing. In the 15th century, veils were normally worn for modesty, to hide the sensuality of the flesh. In this work the veil has the opposite effect; the woman's face is framed by the headdress {{to draw attention to}} her beauty.|$|E
5|$|While these {{guns were}} {{considered}} an improvement by the Navy over {{that of the}} South Carolinas, their placement remained problematic as even in calm water, they were extremely wet and thus difficult to man. The forward guns were moved into the superstructure after sea trials. The casemate-mounted secondary armament was one deck below the main deck and provided {{the majority of the}} complaints from shipping water from the forward positions and breaking <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bow wave imparting extra drag on the design.|$|E
5|$|During his lifetime, Leonardo was valued as an engineer. In {{a letter}} to Ludovico il Moro, he claimed {{to be able to}} create all sorts of {{machines}} both for the protection of a city and for siege. When he fled to Venice in 1499, he found employment as an engineer and devised a system of moveable barricades to protect the city from attack. He also had a scheme for diverting <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arno river, a project on which Niccolò Machiavelli also worked. Leonardo's journals include a vast number of inventions, both practical and impractical. They include musical instruments, a mechanical knight, hydraulic pumps, reversible crank mechanisms, finned mortar shells, and a steam cannon.|$|E

5|$|Eastern South Dakota {{generally}} features higher precipitation {{and lower}} topography than {{the western part}} of the state. Smaller geographic regions of this area include the Coteau des Prairies, the Dissected Till Plains, and the James River Valley. The Coteau des Prairies is a plateau bordered on the east by the Minnesota River Valley and on the west by the James River Basin. Further west, the James River Basin is mostly low, flat, highly eroded land, following <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> James River through South Dakota from north to south. The Dissected Till Plains, an area of rolling hills and fertile soil that covers much of Iowa and Nebraska, extends into the southeastern corner of South Dakota. Layers deposited during the Pleistocene epoch, starting around two million years ago, cover most of eastern South Dakota. These are the youngest rock and sediment layers in the state, the product of several successive periods of glaciation which deposited a large amount of rocks and soil, known as till, over the area.|$|E

5|$|In January 2008 the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) scientists, Hugh Corr and David Vaughan, {{reported}} that 2,200years ago a volcano erupted under the Antarctic ice sheet. This {{was the biggest}} Antarctic eruption in the last 10,000years. The volcano is situated in the Hudson Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier. The eruption spread a layer of volcanic ash (or tephra) {{over the surface of}} the ice sheet. This ash was then buried under the snow and ice. Corr and Vaughan were able to map this ash layer using an airborne radar system and calculate the date of the eruption from the depth of burial of the ash. This method uses dates calculated from nearby ice cores. The presence of the volcano raises the possibility that volcanic activity could have contributed, or may contribute in the future, to increases in <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glacier.|$|E
