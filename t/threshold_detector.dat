5000|$|The <b>threshold</b> <b>detector</b> with {{hysteresis}} {{consists of}} an operational amplifier {{and a series of}} resistors that provide hysteresis. Like other detectors, this device functions as a voltage switch, but with an important difference. The state of the detector output is not directly affected by input voltage, but instead by the voltage drop across its input terminals (here, referred to as Va). From Kirchhoff's Current Law, this value depends both on Vin and the output voltage of the <b>threshold</b> <b>detector</b> itself, both multiplied by a resistor ratio.|$|E
50|$|A <b>threshold</b> <b>detector</b> {{can be used}} {{to correct}} the {{amplitude}} levels although the exact time that the transition occurs may not be in the right place. This timing inaccuracy is referred to as jitter.|$|E
50|$|Cherenkov <b>threshold</b> <b>detectors</b> {{have been}} used for fast timing and time of flight {{measurements}} in particle detectors.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Neutron flux and gamma-ray dose {{have been}} {{measured}} in the experimental facilities of the Oregon State TRIGA reactor. Thermal neutron flux measurements utilized foil activation techniques. The gamma-ray dose was measured with a thermoluminescent dosimetry system. The thermoluminescent material used was LiF. Fast neutron spectrum measurements were performed. The fast flux measurements utilized <b>threshold</b> <b>detectors.</b> The activation data from the various <b>threshold</b> <b>detectors</b> was analyzed using the Effective Threshold Method. Fast flux measurements were made only in the in-core and near-core experimental facilities (where a fission spectrum was assumed to exist) ...|$|R
40|$|Photomultiplier {{tubes and}} {{avalanche}} photodiodes, which {{are commonly used}} in quantum optic experiments, are {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>threshold</b> <b>detectors</b> because, in photon counting mode, they cannot discriminate the number of photoelectrons initially extracted from the absorber in the detector. We argue that they can be called <b>threshold</b> <b>detectors</b> on more account than that. We point out that their their functioning principle relies on two thresholds that are usually thought unimportant individually in the context of EPR-Bell discussion. We show how the combined effect of these threshold can lead to a significant sampling selection bias in the detection of pairs of pulses, resulting in an apparent violation of Bell inequalities. ...|$|R
50|$|A {{regenerator}} includes circuitry {{to recover}} the clock timing information, which is then used to determine when the output signal switches its state. This ensures that the recovered data from the <b>threshold</b> <b>detector</b> is adjusted to provide the correctly timed signal output.|$|E
50|$|In {{the simple}} {{case of a}} <b>{{threshold}}</b> <b>detector</b> the mass-dependent threshold energy allows the discrimination between a lighter particle (which does radiate) and a heavier particle (which does not radiate) of the same energy or momentum. Several threshold stages can be combined to extend the covered energy range.|$|E
50|$|The ASDTIC circuit used {{is based}} around an {{integrator}} and a <b>threshold</b> <b>detector.</b> The incoming signal is integrated {{over time and}} when it exceeds a threshold, a control pulse is generated by the ASDTIC. Within the converter control circuit outside the ASDTIC, a One-Shot Pulse Generator then generates a pulse of constant length to drive the switching transistor.|$|E
50|$|While early {{versions}} of musical Tesla coils generally used zero crossing <b>threshold</b> <b>detectors</b> {{as a method}} of producing music through their spark output, Scott Coppersmith {{was the first person to}} design a complete MIDI-based Tesla coil system.|$|R
30|$|A set of pure metal thin foils {{with the}} {{diameter}} of 1.27  cm and thickness of 0.125  mm were used as <b>threshold</b> <b>detectors</b> to measure the integrated fluxes, and a calculation procedure on iterative adjustment was implemented to derive the differential neutron energy spectrum from the integrated values.|$|R
40|$|A {{new form}} of {{stochastic}} resonance (SR) that occurs in multilevel <b>threshold</b> signal <b>detectors</b> is reported. In contrast to classical SR, which extends the dynamic range of <b>threshold</b> <b>detectors</b> to subthreshold signal levels, this {{new form of}} SR extends the dynamic range to suprathreshold signal strengths. The effect is most dominant, and can outperform networks based on standard engineering design, when all thresholds adapt to the de level of the signal. This has an interesting analogy to de adaptation in neurons. The possible connection between these two effects is discussed...|$|R
50|$|The SawStop saw was {{designed}} to reliably detect flesh contact, with few false alarms. An oscillator generates a 12-volt, 200-kilohertz (khz) pulsed electrical signal, which is applied to a small plate one {{one side of the}} blade. The signal is transferred to the blade by capacitive coupling. A plate {{on the other side of}} the blade picks up the signal and sends it to a <b>threshold</b> <b>detector.</b> If a human contacts the blade, the signal will fall below the threshold. After signal loss for 25 micro seconds (µs), the detector will fire.|$|E
50|$|On {{the left}} 1 is the input {{and for this}} short {{interval}} is constant at 0.2 V. The stream of delta impulses generated at each threshold crossing is shown at 2 {{and the difference between}} 1 and 2 is shown at 3. This difference is integrated to produce the waveform 4. The <b>threshold</b> <b>detector</b> generates a pulse 5 which starts as the waveform 4 crosses the threshold and is sustained until the waveform 4 falls below the threshold. Within the loop 5 triggers the impulse generator to produce a fixed strength impulse.|$|E
50|$|Each type of heat {{detector}} has its advantages, and it cannot {{be said that}} one type of {{heat detector}} should always be used instead of another. If one were to place a rate-of-rise heat detector above a large, closed oven, then every time the door is opened a nuisance alarm could be generated due to the sudden heat transient. In this circumstance the fixed <b>threshold</b> <b>detector</b> would probably be best. If a room filled with highly combustible materials is protected with a fixed heat detector, then a fast-flaming fire could exceed the alarm threshold due to thermal lag. In that case the rate-of-rise heat detector may be preferred.|$|E
50|$|Low-power thyratrons (relay {{tubes and}} trigger tubes) were {{manufactured}} for controlling incandescent lamps, electromechanical relays or solenoids, for bidirectional counters, to perform various functions in Dekatron calculators, for voltage <b>threshold</b> <b>detectors</b> in RC timers, etc. Glow thyratrons were optimized for high gas-discharge light output or even phosphorized {{and used as}} self-displaying shift registers in large-format, crawling-text dot-matrix displays.|$|R
40|$|Light-weight spherical mirrors {{have been}} appositely {{designed}} and built for the gas <b>threshold</b> Cherenkov <b>detectors</b> of the two Hall A spectrometers. The mirrors are made of a I mm thick aluminized plexiglass sheet, reinforced by a rigid backing consisting of a phenolic honeycomb sandwiched between two carbon fiber mats epoxy glued. The produced mirrors have a thickness equivalent to 0. 55 % of radiation length, and an optical slope error of about 5. 5 mrad. These characteristics make these mirrors suitable for the implementation in Cherenkov <b>threshold</b> <b>detectors.</b> Ways to improve the mirror features are also discussed in view of their possible employment in RICH detectors.

40|$|In this paper, we rigorously {{prove the}} intuition that in {{security}} proofs for BB 84 one may regard an incoming signal to Bob as a qubit state. From this result, {{it follows that}} all security proofs for BB 84 based on a virtual qubit entanglement distillation protocol, which was originally proposed by Lo and Chau [H. -K. Lo and H. F. Chau, Science 283, 2050 (1999) ], and Shor and Preskill [P. W. Shor and J. Preskill, Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 441 (2000) ], are all valid even if Bob's actual apparatus cannot distill a qubit state explicitly. As a consequence, especially, the well-known result that a higher bit error rate of 20 % can be tolerated for BB 84 protocol by using two-way classical communications is still valid even when Bob uses <b>threshold</b> <b>detectors.</b> Using the same technique, we also prove {{the security of the}} Bennett-Brassard-Mermin 1992 (BBM 92) protocol where Alice and Bob both use <b>threshold</b> <b>detectors.</b> Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures; references changed; revised argument for the security proof; typos correcte...|$|R

The decoded signal is then fed into the correlator-based matched filter which multiplies the signal by the template waveform. The decision which chip is empty and which chip contains a pulse is {{made on the basis}} of autocorrelation properties of the Gaussian monocycle at the <b>threshold</b> <b>detector.</b> At the output of the <b>threshold</b> <b>detector,</b> the transmitted PIM data encoded stream is estimated by removing redundant ([...] [...]...|$|E

40|$|This {{correspondence}} {{evaluates the}} performance of the maximum likelihood (ML) and several suboptimal arrival time estimators for optical pulses. The performance analysis of a 'sliding window' counter followed by a <b>threshold</b> <b>detector</b> is achieved by deriving an expression for the first-crossing density of the output of the counter...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{security}} of practically decoy state {{quantum key distribution}} under fake state attack is considered. If quantum key distribution is insecure under this type of attack, decoy sources can not also provide it with enough security. Strictly analysis shows that Eve should eavesdrop {{with the aid of}} photon-number-resolving instruments. In practical implementation of decoy state quantum key distribution where statistical fluctuation is considered, however, Eve can attack it successfully with <b>threshold</b> <b>detectors...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss how}} <b>threshold</b> <b>detectors</b> {{can be used}} for a direct {{measurement}} of the full counting statistics (FCS) of current fluctuations and how to implement Jose phson junctions in this respect. We propose a scheme to characterize the full co unting statistics from the current dependence of the escape rate measured. We il lustrate the scheme with explicit results for tunnel, diffusive and quasi-ballis tic mesoscopic conductors. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{influence}} of noise modulation on the detection of subthreshold periodic signals in <b>threshold</b> <b>detectors</b> under the paradigm of stochastic resonance. More particularly, we show that having an input noise amplitude modulated by the input signal can enhance the phenomenon of stochastic resonance. We then apply this result to a neuron model for which the noise modulation mechanism is an intrinsic property coming from the shot-noise nature of the neuron membrane potential. ...|$|R

Each burst starts at zero phase, with tight tolerances on signal amplitude and frequency.

40|$|The quantum {{measurement}} {{problem as}} was formulated by von Neumann in 1933 {{can be solved}} by going beyond the operational quantum formalism. In our "prequantum model" quantum systems are symbolic representations of classical random fields. The Schrödinger's dynamics is a special form of the linear dynamics of classical fields. Measurements are described as interactions of classical fields with detectors. Discontinuity, the "collapse of the wave function", has the trivial origin: usage of <b>threshold</b> type <b>detectors.</b> The von Neumann projection postulate {{can be interpreted as}} the formal mathematical encoding of the absence of coincidence detection in measurement on a single quantum system, e. g., photon's polarization measurement. Our model, prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT), in combination with measurements by <b>threshold</b> <b>detectors</b> satisfies the quantum restriction on coincidence detections: the second order coherence is less than one (opposite to all known semiclassical and classical feld models). The basic rule of quantum probability, the Born's rule, is derived from properties of prequantum random felds interacting with <b>threshold</b> type <b>detectors.</b> Comparison with De Broglie's views to quantum mechanics as theory of physical waves with singularities is presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} verification of quantum features, such as entanglement, at large scales is extremely challenging because of environment-induced decoherence. Indeed, measurement techniques for demonstrating the quantumness of multiparticle {{systems in the}} presence of losses are difficult to define and, if not sufficiently accurate, they provide wrong conclusions. We present a Bell test where one photon of an entangled pair is amplified and then detected by <b>threshold</b> <b>detectors,</b> whose signals undergo postselection. The amplification is performed by a classical machine, which produces a fully separable micro-macro state. However, by adopting such a technique, one can surprisingly observe a violation of the CHSH inequality. This {{is due to the fact}} that ignoring the detection loophole, opened by the postselection and the system losses, can lead to misinterpretations, such as claiming the micro-macro entanglement in a setup where evidently there is not. By using <b>threshold</b> <b>detectors</b> and postselection, one can only infer the entanglement of the initial pair of photons, so micro-micro entanglement, as it is further confirmed by the violation of a non-separability criterion for bipartite systems. How to detect photonic micro-macro entanglement {{in the presence of}} losses with currently available technology remains an open question. Comment: 14 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|This letter {{presents}} the sparse vector signal detection from one bit compressed sensing measurements, {{in contrast to}} the previous works which deal with scalar signal detection. In this letter, available results are extended to the vector case and the GLRT detector and the optimal quantizer design are obtained. Also, a double-detector scheme is introduced in which a sensor level <b>threshold</b> <b>detector</b> is integrated into network level GLRT to improve the performance. The detection criteria of oracle and clairvoyant detectors are also derived. Simulation results show that with careful design of the <b>threshold</b> <b>detector,</b> the overall detection performance of double-detector scheme would be better than the sign-GLRT proposed in [1] and close to oracle and clairvoyant detectors. Also, the proposed detector is applied to spectrum sensing and the results are near the well known energy detector which uses the real valued data while the proposed detector only uses the sign of the data.

Generated entanglement includes only {{one type of}} error, which enables efficient entanglement distillation. In contrast to the known protocols with such a property, our protocol with ideal detectors achieves the theoretical limit of the success probability and the fidelity to a Bell state, promising higher efficiencies in the repeaters. We also show that the advantage of our protocol remains even with realistic <b>threshold</b> <b>detectors.</b> Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|Parametric down-conversion (PDC) sources can be {{used for}} quantum key {{distribution}} (QKD). One can use a PDC source as a triggered single photon source. Recently, there are various practical proposals of the decoy state QKD with triggering PDC sources. In this paper, we generalize the passive decoy state idea, originally proposed by Mauerer and Silberhorn. The generalized passive decoy state idea can be applied to cases where either <b>threshold</b> <b>detectors</b> or photon number resolving detectors are used. The decoy state protocol proposed by Adachi, Yamamoto, Koashi and Imoto (AYKI) can be treated as a special case of the generalized passive decoy state method. By simulating a recent PDC experiment, we compare various practical decoy state protocols with the infinite decoy protocol and also compare the cases using <b>threshold</b> <b>detectors</b> and photon-number resolving detectors. Our simulation result shows that with the AYKI protocol, one can achieve a key generation rate that is close to the theoretical limit of infinite decoy protocol. Furthermore, our simulation result shows that a photon-number resolving detector appears to be not very useful for improving QKD performance in this case. Although our analysis is focused on the QKD with PDC sources, we emphasize that it can also be applied to other QKD setups with triggered single photon sources...|$|R
