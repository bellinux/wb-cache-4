2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Behr, Li Wenda told him Puyi was a very clumsy man who [...] "invariably forgot to close doors behind him, forgot to flush the toilet, forgot to turn the <b>tap</b> <b>off</b> after washing his hands, had a genius for creating an instant, disorderly mess around him". Puyi had been so used to having his needs catered to that he never entirely learned how to function on his own. Puyi {{tried very hard to}} be modest and humble, always being the last person to board a bus, which meant that frequently missed the ride and in restaurants would tell the waitresses that [...] "You should not be serving me. I should be serving you." [...] Pujie told Behr: ...|$|E

50|$|Transport for NSW {{has stated}} that {{customers}} forget to <b>tap</b> <b>off</b> after about 3% of journeys, so they are charged the default fare.|$|E
50|$|Being a {{distance}} based system, Opal card users {{are required to}} tap on and <b>tap</b> <b>off</b> on all modes (apart from the Manly Ferry) to ensure the correct fare is charged. If a user does not correctly <b>tap</b> <b>off</b> after tapping on, a default fare will be charged, corresponding to the maximum fare on that mode of travel. However, a lower default fare applies {{if it is not}} possible to reach the maximum fare on the route for which the tap on took place. The default fare will be charged after a time-out period of five hours from initial tap on or if the user changes modes or taps on at a gated station.|$|E

50|$|Otherwise if they tap upon {{entering}} a TTC vehicle/station then tap {{upon entering}} a UPX or GO Transit train station/bus, <b>tap</b> <b>off</b> and taped onto another TTC vehicle/station {{they would be}} charged another TTC fare as the electronic transfer on the Presto card would be revoked.|$|E
5000|$|If a team {{scores from}} the <b>tap</b> <b>off</b> in sudden death, without the {{opposing}} team having had possession, the opposition have one set of six touches to score. If they don't score within those six touches, the game is won by the first team that scored.|$|E

50|$|The 1983 {{tournament is}} the latest to {{incorporate}} first-round byes for seeded teams. The first-round best-of-three series <b>tapped</b> <b>off</b> on Tuesday and Wednesday, April 19 and 20; the second-round best-of-sevens on Sunday to the following Wednesday, April 27. Counting from Tuesday the byes provided five to eight extra days idle.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} solution <b>taps</b> <b>off</b> {{some hot}} exhaust gas from the propulsion motor and routes it instead through the generator turbine. This gas may {{also be used to}} power the control surface actuators, as was used for Vigilant. This is one of the simplest and lightest electrical power supplies available for a missile.|$|R

Part of the light is <b>tapped</b> <b>off</b> by a beamsplitter (BS) to the wavefront sensor and the control hardware which sends updated signals to the DM and TT mirrors.|$|R
5000|$|Aluminium is {{very hard}} to reduce. As a result, {{aluminium}} contamination of the iron is not a problem. However, it does increase the viscosity of the slag ( [...] and [...] ). This will have a number of adverse effects on furnace operation. The thicker slag will slow the descent of the charge, prolonging the process. High aluminium will also {{make it more difficult to}} <b>tap</b> <b>off</b> the liquid slag. At the extreme this could lead to a frozen furnace.|$|E
5000|$|The {{alternate}} direct form II only needs N delay units, where N is {{the order}} of the filter - potentially half as much as direct form I. This structure is obtained by reversing {{the order of}} the numerator and denominator sections of Direct Form I, since they are in fact two linear systems, and the commutativity property applies. Then, one will notice that there are two columns of delays (...) that <b>tap</b> <b>off</b> the center net, and these can be combined since they are redundant, yielding the implementation as shown below.|$|E
5000|$|An {{easy way}} to explain how {{multiple}} buffering works {{is to take a}} real-world example. It is a nice sunny day and you have decided to get the paddling pool out, only you can not find your garden hose. You'll have to fill the pool with buckets. So you fill one bucket (or buffer) from the tap, turn the <b>tap</b> <b>off,</b> walk over to the pool, pour the water in, walk back to the tap to repeat the exercise. This is analogous to single buffering. The tap has to be turned off while you [...] "process" [...] the bucket of water.|$|E
5000|$|Opal {{readers are}} used to <b>tap</b> on or <b>off.</b> They are {{installed}} atop existing ticket barriers, or mounted on a stand-alone pole at railway stations, light rail stops or ferry wharves. Buses are the exception, with readers installed on the bus itself. The rollout of Opal technology has seen a new style of gates introduced {{at a number of}} major stations. When <b>tapping</b> on or <b>off,</b> all readers display the current balance of the card or an error message if the tap failed to work. <b>Tap</b> <b>offs</b> also display the fare deducted for the trip. A trip that is part of an existing journey will display [...] "transfer" [...] when tapping on.|$|R
50|$|Energy in {{the spark}} plugs {{was cut off}} and the engine was {{operating}} at rated thrust. During the initial phase of engine operation, the gaseous hydrogen start tank would be recharged in those engines having a restart requirement. The hydrogen tank was repressurized by <b>tapping</b> <b>off</b> a controlled mixture of LH2 from the thrust chamber fuel inlet manifold and warmer hydrogen from the thrust chamber fuel injection manifold just before entering the injector.|$|R
50|$|The {{filter housing}} {{consists}} of two metal or plastic cylinders sitting {{one on top of}} the other. The upper one has a lid and can be filled with impure water. In the bottom of the upper cylinder are one or more holes fitted with porcelain filter columns. The water is forced through the filters by gravity, and then trickles down to the lower cylinder where it is stored and <b>tapped</b> <b>off</b> as required.|$|R
5000|$|Failure to tap {{the card}} upon {{disembarking}} ("missed tap-off") will cause the maximum fare to be deducted, {{under the assumption that}} the passenger travelled to the point furthest away from the origin point. (For example, passengers failing to <b>tap</b> <b>off</b> when boarding at Union Station will be assessed the fare travelling from Union Station to Kitchener GO Station, the point furthest away on any GO train route serving Union Station.) Passengers regularly travel by GO train may also set a [...] "default trip" [...] between two GO train stations, allowing them to avoid tapping their cards upon disembarking; passengers doing so will have the appropriate fare deducted upon embarking at either endpoint.|$|E
5000|$|In homes, {{the water}} loop {{may be as}} simple as a single pipe that [...] "loops" [...] the flow through every {{radiator}} in a zone. In such a system, flow to the individual radiators cannot be modulated as all of the water is flowing through every radiator in the zone. Slightly more complicated systems use a [...] "main" [...] pipe that flows uninterrupted around the zone; the individual radiators <b>tap</b> <b>off</b> {{a small portion of the}} flow in the main pipe. In these systems, individual radiators can be modulated. Alternatively, a number of loops with several radiators can be installed, the flow in each loop or zone controlled by a zone valve connected to a thermostat.|$|E
5000|$|But {{with old}} K&T, a past {{electrician}} might have reasoned as follows: [...] "I have a 20 amp circuit on one phase over here, and another 20 amp circuit on an opposite phase over there. Rather than run {{an entirely new}} set of wires for this one device, I will just <b>tap</b> <b>off</b> the supply wires of those two circuits and bring them together for this one device." [...] This method of wiring does work and it reduces the amount of wire used, but it makes electrical problems {{very hard to find}} and fix, with (possibly undocumented) wires going all over the place within the walls and ceilings, to whatever was the most expedient supply or return wire at the time of installation.|$|E
5000|$|This {{system was}} known as the SOSS, or Satellite Operations Support System. [...] Analog feeds were discontinued, and instead uplinked {{digitally}} (but still in SCPC fashion and on 2 satellite transponders) using Musicam encoding, and received using ComStream ABR-700 digital audio satellite demodulators, which <b>tapped</b> <b>off</b> the 70 MHz IF bus of a Satellite System Corporation Model 4421 downconverter, which was in essence the main satellite receiver for the system, taking in the L-band input from the dish's LNB.|$|R
25|$|All {{microwave}} generators {{of the era}} worked along similar principles; electrons {{were pulled}} off a cathode towards an anode {{at the far end}} of a tube. Along the way, they passed one or more resonators, essentially hollow copper rings with a slit cut along the inner edge. As the electrons passed the slit, they caused the resonator to resonate with radio energy, which could be <b>tapped</b> <b>off</b> as a signal. The frequency could be adjusted by controlling the speed of the electrons (via the applied voltage) or by changing the dimensions of the resonator.|$|R
50|$|However, {{it may be}} {{seen that}} if some energy is placed in a 'sender' coil when it is in {{resonance}} then the coil will ring {{for a number of}} cycles before losing the energy to its resistance. Provided the Q of the transmitting circuit is high enough to overcome the coupling coefficient, then most of the power can eventually be absorbed by the receiving coil over several cycles and can be <b>tapped</b> <b>off.</b> The remaining power will be lost in the resistance of the sender, and some in the receiver coil also.|$|R
50|$|Claire, {{recovering}} from the paralysis, barely manages to shut the <b>tap</b> <b>off</b> in time to save herself from drowning. When she regains her strength, she finds that Norman is missing from the bathroom floor. She crawls {{down the stairs to}} the phone, and notices Norman apparently unconscious, his head bleeding profusely. As she reaches over him and attempts to make a phone call, he grabs her ankle and in a blind panic she rushes out of the house, grabbing the car keys and a cellular phone and driving away in a truck with the couple's sailboat hitched to the back. As she is crossing the bridge over Lake Champlain, Norman bursts through the back window and grabs Claire; she frantically dials 911 and the truck careens down the embankment into the lake.|$|E
50|$|The series {{revolves}} around five small petals {{who live in}} a large, overgrown garden. Bougie, Boronia, Poppy, Notsy and Imp greet each day in wide-eyed wonder as their explorations among the giant flowers and trees uncover surprises and delights. However the Petals are just small little people that you can't see but you can imagine them. They're also not fairies and don't have magical powers, but they're very athletic and only Bougie and Poppy are able to fly. Here they discover many surprises, delights and adventures such as helping a baby bird, picking berries, helping Imp turn a dripping <b>tap</b> <b>off,</b> playing a game of hide and seek, making bubbles with some soap, Imp rescuing Notsy with fireflies when she got lost, using a broken mirror to frighten Jeffrey and putting on a show to cheer up Worm when he had a kink in his tail. Joining them in their adventures were five other characters who were all insects. They were Cicada, Ant, Spider, Worm and Ladybird. There's also an orange playful cat named Jeffrey who likes to hang around in the garden and cause trouble for the Petals.|$|E
5000|$|If a {{hurricane}} struck Florida {{and there was}} a shortage of water, everything else equal, the price of bottled water would increase. Water in Florida, before this shortage, was used for drinking water, cooking, watering plants, and bathing. With the <b>tap</b> <b>off,</b> the price of bottled water has increased {{to such an extent that}} bottled water will surely not be purchased for watering plants or bathing. That is, the increase in price reflects the increase in the value we attribute to the last use of the last unit in the supply of the good. To explain, before the hurricane, water was valued according to the fact that it would be used for bathing and watering plants. Now, with a shortage, it is valued according to its ability to quench thirst and cook food. The latter uses importance is [...] "approximated" [...] in the price of the good. The bottled water which now costs, say, $20 a bottle, is an approximation of the value attribute to drinking water, cooking water, and whatever else it might be used for at the higher price—given that previous uses are not considered due to the shortage of supply and its corollary, the increase in price. That is why it is said that a homogeneous stock of goods is valued according to its final utility—according to its last use of a stock of a good.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We propose and {{demonstrate}} a novel and effective supervisory scheme {{to monitor the}} optical-path routing at the optical cross connects in all-optical transport networks. Any error in optical-path routing due to failure in the cross connect can be detected without <b>tapping</b> <b>off</b> the power at the data wavelengths, and no dedicated monitoring light source is required. The scheme supports in-service surveillance. It can facilitate the network management in the optical layer of all-optical and reconfigurable transport networks.

50|$|The heat {{exchanger}} was a shell assembly, {{consisting of a}} duct, bellows, flanges, and coils. It was mounted in the turbine exhaust duct between the oxidizer turbine discharge manifold and the thrust chamber. It heated and expanded helium gas {{for use in the}} third stage or converted LOX to gaseous oxygen for the second stage for maintaining vehicle oxidizer tank pressurization. During engine operation, either LOX was <b>tapped</b> <b>off</b> the oxidizer high-pressure duct or helium was provided from the vehicle stage and routed to the {{heat exchanger}} coils.|$|R
