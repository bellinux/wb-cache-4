40|$|Truemper {{configurations}} {{are four}} types of graphs (namely <b>thetas,</b> wheels, prisms and pyramids) that {{play an important role}} in the proof of several decomposition theorems for hereditary graph classes. In this paper, we prove two structure theorems: one for graphs with no <b>thetas,</b> wheels and prisms as induced subgraphs, and one for graphs with no <b>thetas,</b> wheels and pyramids as induced subgraphs. A consequence is a polynomial time recognition algorithms for these two classes. In Part II of this series we generalize these results to graphs with no <b>thetas</b> and wheels as induced subgraphs, and in Parts III and IV, using the obtained structure, we solve several optimization problems for these graphs...|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} the odd even effect in {{properties}} of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) and/or technologies derived from them is poorly understood. We report that hydrophobicity and, hence, surface wetting of SAMs are dominated {{by the nature of}} the substrate (surface roughness and identity) and SAM tilt angle, which influences surface dipoles/orientation of the terminal moiety. We measured static contact angles (<b>theta(s))</b> made by water droplets on n-alkanethiolate SAMs with an odd (SAM(O)) or even (SAM(E)) number of carbons (average <b>theta(s)</b> range of 105. 8 - 112. 1 degrees). When SAMs were fabricated on smooth 2 ̆ 2 template-stripped 2 ̆ 2 metal (M-TS) surfaces [root-mean-square (rms) roughness = 0. 36 +/- 0. 01 nm for Au-TS and 0. 60 +/- 0. 04 nm for Ag-TS], the odd-even effect, characterized by a zigzag oscillation in values of <b>theta(s),</b> was observed. We, however, did not observe the same effect with rougher 2 ̆ 2 as-deposited 2 ̆ 2 (M-AD) surfaces (rms roughness = 2. 27 +/- 0. 16 nm for Au-AD and 5. 13 +/- 0. 22 nm for Ag-AD). The odd-even effect in hydrophobicity inverts when the substrate changes from Au-TS (higher <b>theta(s)</b> for SAM(E) than SAM(O), with average Delta <b>theta(s)</b> (vertical bar n - (n + 1) vertical bar) approximate to 3 degrees) to Ag-TS (higher <b>theta(s)</b> for SAM(O) than SAM(E), with average Delta <b>theta(s)</b> (vertical bar n - (n + 1) vertical bar) approximate to 2 degrees). A comparison of hydrophobicity across Ag-TS and Au-TS showed a statistically significant difference (Student 2 ̆ 7 s t test) between SAM(E) (Delta <b>theta(s)</b> (vertical bar Ag evens - Au evens vertical bar) approximate to 5 degrees; P 3 ̆c 0. 01) but failed to show statistically significant differences on SAM(O) (Delta <b>theta(s)</b> (vertical bar Ag odds) (- Au odds vertical bar) approximate to 1 degrees; p 3 ̆e 0. 1). From these results, we deduce that the roughness of the metal substrate (from comparison of M-AD versus M-TS) and orientation of the terminal -CH 2 CH 3 (by comparing SAM(E) and SAM(O) on Au-TS versus Ag-TS) play major roles in the hydrophobicity and, by extension, general wetting properties of n-alkanethiolate SAMs...|$|R
5|$|As {{discussed}} above, any non-pseudoforest graph contains as a subgraph a handcuff, {{figure 8}}, or <b>theta</b> graph; any handcuff or figure 8 graph may be contracted {{to form a}} butterfly graph (five-vertex figure 8), and any <b>theta</b> graph may be contracted to form a diamond graph (four-vertex <b>theta</b> graph), so any non-pseudoforest contains either a butterfly or a diamond as a minor, {{and these are the}} only minor-minimal non-pseudoforest graphs. Thus, a graph is a pseudoforest if and only if it does not have the butterfly or the diamond as a minor. If one forbids only the diamond but not the butterfly, the resulting larger graph family consists of the cactus graphs and disjoint unions of multiple cactus graphs.|$|E

Approximate estimates based on energetics, explicitly taking into account the modal symmetry of perturbations, agree well with the results of exact calculations based on the solution of torque equations. For homeotropic alignment (b. <b>thetas</b> 1 = 0) calculations predict that the SP domain width should decrease when the sample is heated away from the smectic transition point; at a given temperature when H is rotated through a small angle with respect to the sample planes the domains should grow wider.

Materials, such as nematic polymers, which exhibit static periodic domains (PD) in splay geometry (of the kind discovered by Lonberg and Meyer, 1985, Phys. Rev.
