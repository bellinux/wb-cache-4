40|$|From data in {{the present}} we can predict the future <b>and</b> retrodict <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> These {{predictions}} <b>and</b> retrodictions are for histories — most simply time sequences of events. Quantum mechanics gives probabilities for individual histories in a decoherent set of alternative histories. This paper discusses several issues connected with the distinction between prediction and retrodiction in quantum cosmology: the difference between classical and quantum retrodiction, the permanence of <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> why we predict the future but remember <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>the</b> nature <b>and</b> utility of reconstructing <b>the</b> <b>past(s),</b> <b>and</b> information theoretic measures of the utility of history.

5|$|Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak of the University of Maryland {{discusses}} how {{one aspect}} of Kiarostami's cinematic style {{is that he is}} able to capture essences of Persian poetry and create poetic imagery within the landscape of his films. In Where Is the Friend's Home? and The Wind Will Carry Us, classical Persian poetry is directly quoted in the film, highlighting the artistic link and intimate connection between them. This in turn reflects on the connection between <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> present, between continuity and change.|$|E

5|$|Applewhite {{believed}} in the ancient astronaut hypothesis, which claimed that extraterrestrials had visited humanity in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> placed humans on Earth and would return to collect a select few. Parts of this teaching bear similarities to the Reformed Christian concept of election, likely owing to Applewhite's Presbyterian upbringing. He often discussed extraterrestrials using phrases from Star Trek and stated that aliens communicated with him through the show.|$|E

For example, the Māori of Stewart Island/Rakiura continue to harvest the chicks of the sooty shearwater as they have done for centuries, using traditional methods (called kaitiakitanga) to manage the harvest, but now work with the University of Otago in studying the populations. In Greenland, however, uncontrolled hunting is pushing many species into steep decline.|$|E
5|$|Deep sky {{surveys show}} that galaxies are often found in groups and clusters.

Isolated galaxies can produce stars at a higher rate than normal, as their gas is not being stripped by other nearby galaxies.|$|E

If an individual were to follow Krishna's words then {{they would be able to}} free their self from the limitations of time. Even if it cannot be fully attained, the effort in attempting it is still important. The way for mankind to understand the divine will is through prayer and through the power of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
