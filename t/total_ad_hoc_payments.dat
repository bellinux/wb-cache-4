By exploiting random variation in weather and the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994, which mandated crop insurance coverage for the first time, I employ two natural experiments that identify the causal effect of disaster relief on farm failure rates. I examine the survival smoothing contribution of crop insurance {{by looking at the}} relative effect of disaster relief across two regimes, pre- and post- 1994. Prior to 1994 <b>ad</b> <b>hoc,</b> ex post disaster payments were the primary form of disaster relief. Shortly after the 1994 Act virtually all disaster relief came through crop insurance indemnities. I find that disaster relief in the form of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> disaster <b>payments</b> slightly reduces the average farm failure rate, while average farm failure rates increase under the crop insurance regime. The relative effect suggests that farm failure rates increase by 1. 7 percentage points (about 30 -percent) under the crop insurance regime.

40|$|The {{current debate}} {{surrounding}} the 2012 Farm Act stresses cutting costs while maintaining, or even strengthening, farmers’ “safety net. ” One {{way to cut}} costs is to reduce or eliminate potential overlap of farm program payments. Using simulations, we explore {{the interaction between the}} Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE) program and a revenue assurance (RA) crop insurance program for corn, soybean, and wheat farmers in IL, MN, and SD. Additionally, we examine whether receiving benefits from multiple programs (an RA program, the Supplemental Revenue (SURE) program, and an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> disaster assistance program) distorts farmers’ business decisions. We find overlap between ACRE and crop insurance, which could lead to budgetary savings if these two programs were to be integrated. Moreover, despite policymakers explicitly incorporating insurance indemnities into SURE payment calculations, access to both programs can alter behavior. Finally, in a counter-factual analysis, we show that removing <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>payments</b> from the SURE would likely alter farm behavior. commodity support, average crop revenue election, Supplemental Revenue Assistance, expected utility, corn, wheat, soybeans, Agricultural and Food Policy, Production Economics, Risk and Uncertainty,...|$|R

The introduction of the "Theoric Fund" is correctly dated {{to the middle of}} the fourth century, but this fact has obscured the existence of earlier theoric distributions.

While Old Comedy does not explicitly refer to theoric payments, its references to the economics of the theater (e. g. entrance costs, theater-leasing) can nonetheless contribute to our understanding of the distributions of state funds for attending festivals in the fifth century and help to sort out some of the confusing and contradictory information on other distributions of state funds preserved in ancient sources.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{unintended}} consequences of government policy, specifically policy meant to benefit agricultural producers. The first chapter asks how agricultural subsidies affect farmland rental rates. Chapter two examines the relative effects of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> disaster <b>payments</b> and crop insurance, focusing on the potential to smooth income shocks, and the final chapter studies the targeting efficiency of the Conservation Reserve Program. Chapter one exploits exogenous variation in agricultural subsidies to measure the effects on farmland rental rates. The primary finding is that landlords capture one-fifth of the marginal subsidy dollar per acre. This finding stands {{in contrast to the}} standard assumption that landlords immediately capture the entire subsidy. There is some evidence that the share of the subsidy captured by landlords increases as the farmland rental market becomes more competitive. The analysis also indicates that the lower effective price of land induces tenants to rent more land such that they gain roughly $ 1 per dollar of subsidy. Taken together, the results suggest that agricultural subsidies benefit farmers, as well as individuals that own agricultural land. Chapter two exploits random weather variation and exogenous variation in crop insurance take-up in order to investigate the relative effect of two forms of government-provided disaster relief on farm failure rates. (cont.) I find that disaster relief in the form of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> disaster <b>payments</b> slightly reduces the average farm failure rate, while average farm failure rates increase under a crop insurance regime. The relative effect suggests that farm failure rates increase by 1. 7 percentage points (about 30 -percent) under the crop insurance regime.

40|$|Critics of the U. S. {{proposal}} to the World Trade Organization (WTO) made in October 2005 are correct when they argue that adoption of the proposal would significantly reduce available support under the current farm program structure. Using historical prices and yields from 1980 to 2004, we estimate that loan rates would have to drop by 9 percent and target prices would have to drop by 10 percent {{in order to meet}} the proposed aggregate Amber Box and Blue Box limits. While this finding should cheer those who think that reform of U. S. farm programs is long overdue, it alarms those who want to maintain a strong safety net for U. S. agriculture. The dilemma of needing to reform farm programs while maintaining a strong safety net could be resolved by redesigning programs so that they target revenue rather than price. Building on a base of 70 percent Green Box income insurance, a program that provides a crop-specific revenue guarantee equal to 98 percent of the product of the current effective target price and expected county yield would fit into the proposed aggregate Amber and Blue Box limits. Payments would be triggered whenever the product of the season-average price and county average yield fell below this 98 percent revenue guarantee. Adding the proposed crop-specific constraints lowers the coverage level to 95 percent. Moving from programs that target price to ones that target revenue would eliminate the rationale for <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> disaster <b>payments.</b> Program payments would automatically arrive whenever significant crop losses or economic losses caused by low prices occurred. Also, much of the need for the complicated mechanism (the Standard Reinsurance Agreement) that transfers most risk of the U. S. crop insurance to the federal government would be eliminated because the federal government would directly assume the risk through farm programs. Changing the focus of federal farm programs from price targeting to revenue targeting would not be easy. Farmers have long relied on price supports and the knowledge that crop losses are often adequately covered by heavily subsidized crop insurance or by <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> disaster <b>payments.</b> Farmers and their leaders would only be willing to support a change to revenue targeting if they see that the current system is untenable in an era of tight federal budgets and WTO limits. farm safety net, revenue targeting, U.

30|$|Congress first {{authorized}} {{crop insurance}} in the 1930 ’s {{in the period}} after the Great Depression {{that was the beginning}} of many agricultural policies that still exist today (Glauber, 2013). Crop insurance was mostly limited to major crops (e.g., corn) in the primary producing areas until the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980 (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Risk Management Agency USDA-RMA 2013 c). The 1980 Act expanded crops and areas eligible for insurance and authorized a 30 percent subsidy of the crop insurance premium. Even though crop insurance expanded, <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> disaster <b>payments</b> remained common. In 2000 legislation was enacted which expanded the role of the private sector in developing new contracts, premium subsidies were increased, and restrictions on the development of livestock (and dairy) insurance products were removed. The result is that acres covered by crop insurance increased from 45 million in 1981 to 272 million in 2008 (Goodwin and Smith, 2013). The majority of U.S. corn, soybeans and wheat acres have been insured in recent years. Thus, the largest crops by acres cultivated and sales have been largely covered by crop insurance policies. The same cannot be said, however, for specialty crops, livestock, and dairy production.|$|R

2500|$|Liquidation is the final, most frequent, {{and most}} basic {{insolvency}} procedure. Since registered companies became {{available to the}} investing public, the Joint Stock Companies Winding-Up Act 1844 and all its successors contained a route for a company's life {{to be brought to}} an end. The basic purpose of liquidation is to conclude a company's activities and to sell off assets (i.e. [...] "liquidate", turn goods into [...] "liquid assets" [...] or money) to pay creditors, or shareholders if any value remains. Either the company (its shareholders or directors) can initiate the process through a [...] "voluntary liquidation", or the creditors can force it through a [...] "compulsory liquidation". In urgent circumstances, a provisional liquidation order can also be granted if there is a serious threat to dissipation of a company's assets: in this case, a company may not be notified. By contrast, a voluntary liquidation begins if the company's members vote to liquidate with a 75 per cent special resolution. If the directors can make a statutory declaration that the company is solvent, the directors or shareholders remain in control, but if the company is insolvent, the creditors will control the voluntary winding up. Otherwise, a [...] "compulsory liquidation" [...] may be initiated by either the directors, the company, some shareholders or creditors bringing a petition for winding up to the court. In principle, almost any member (this is usually shareholders, but can also be anyone registered on the company's member list) can bring a petition for liquidation to begin, so long as they have held shares for over six months, or there is only one shareholder. In Re Peveril Gold Mines Ltd Lord Lindley MR held that a company could not obstruct a member's right to bring a petition by requiring that two directors consented or the shareholder had over 20 per cent of share capital. A member's right to bring a petition cannot be changed by a company constitution. However, in Re Rica Gold Washing Co the Court of Appeal invented an extra-statutory requirement that a member must have a sufficient amount of money (£75 was insufficient) invested before bringing a petition. For creditors to bring a petition, there must simply be proof that the creditor is owed a debt that is due. In Mann v Goldstein the incorporated hairdressing and wig business, with shops in Pinner and Haverstock Hill, of two married couples broke down in acrimony. Goldstein and his company petitioned for winding up, claiming unpaid directors fees and payment for a wig delivery, but Mann argued that Goldstein had received the fees through <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>payments</b> and another company owed money for the wigs. Ungoed Thomas J held the winding-up petition was not the place to decide the debt actually existed, and it would be an abuse of process to continue.|$|R

Therefore, our results provide a theoretical understanding of to what extent <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> nodes can benefit from base stations in multi-hop wireless networks. I...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} {{toward the}} design of a new adaptive quality of service (QOS) paradigm for wireless <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks. We address some of the key performance problems in the broader realm of wireless <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks, including mobile <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks and emerging wireless <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> sensor networks. Wireless <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks represent autonomous distributed systems that are infrastructureless, fully distributed, and multi-hop in nature. Over the last several years, wireless <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks have attracted considerable research attention in the general networking and performance community. This has been fueled by recent technological advances in the development of multifunctional and low-cost wireless communication devices. Wireless <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks have diverse applications spanning several domains, including military, commercial, medical, and home networks. The results of all this research activity the wireless <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks are starting to move from the research domain into the real world and are being gradually integrated into our daily lives. Projections indicate that this will accelerate later in the decade, to the point where some analysts predict that these types of self-organizin...|$|R
40|$|Mobile <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> {{network is}} very much popular due to its flexibility, easy to install and low cost. The aims of this paper it to analyze delay of mobile <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> network for DSDV routing protocol. Delay is most {{important}} parameter to evaluate performance of a mobile <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> network. It measures total time taken by the packet to reach the destination. Delays in <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> network get affected by mobility of nodes, packet transmission speed, and length of route and interference level along the route. In this paper delay of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> network is measured by changing various parameters of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> network such as number of nodes, pause time, speed and connections between the nodes. Network simulator ns 2. 34 is used for simulatio...|$|R
