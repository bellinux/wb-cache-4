40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the optimization of the thickness control system on the hot rolling mill at The Danish Steel Works Ltd. The optimization is done by replacing the existing linear analog <b>thickness</b> <b>controller</b> with a nonlinear digital controller. The discrete time control law used for the digital controller is derived from a multivariable controller which is designed using a model based on data from the rolling mill at The Danish Steel Works Ltd, see [Pedersen, 1995 b]. The implementation of the digital controller therefore also serves as a preliminary test of the multivariable control law. Toverify the performance of the new control law its performance and stability of the two control laws is compared. 2. PLATE THICKNESS CONTROL The purpose of the hot rolling mill is to make a preheated steel block thinner and longer, see Figure 1. This is done by pulling the plate through two parallel rolls mounted in the rolling mill. Due to the large forces ob...|$|E
40|$|To {{improve the}} light output of yellow autocar {{headlights}} a blue reflecting multilayer interference filter was deposited {{directly on the}} bulbs. Such a filter was produced by the alternate deposition of Si 3 N 4 and SiO 2 layers in a standard LPCVD system operated at one temperature profile only. By properly selecting the pressure, gas flow characteristics and load geometry in the quartz furnace tube for each layer material, both processes could be optimized. The growth of the filter was monitored by an in-situ optical <b>thickness</b> <b>controller.</b> Presently, several hundreds (H 4) halogen lamps were coated simultaneously with an 11 -layer Si 3 N 4 /SiO 2 blue reflecting interference filter in a LPCVD reactor with a cycle time of less than 3 hours. The layer thickness uniformity of the deposited filter on each lamp was better than ± 2 %. The optical efficiency of the yellow multilayer lamps was improved by more than 20 % with respect to conventional ones equipped with an outer glass jacket that selectively absorbs blue light...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to design a <b>{{thickness}}</b> <b>controller</b> fo a hot rolling mill. The thickness control problem is difficult and small improvements make large savings possible. It is therefore relevant to use advanced control strategiesfor controlling the plate thickness. In the report a short introduction to the thickness control problem, and a description ofhow thickness control is done today, is first given. Then a physical model for the hot rolling process is developed, measurements are collected, and the parameters of this model are found using system identification. The model is used for finding a control strategy and to design a controller for the plate thickness. As control methods feedback linearization and eigenspace design are used. The performance of the controller is investigated using computer simulations. Furthermore, the stability is analyzed {{and the effects of}} the present parameter variations is also investigated. The main effort has been spent on developing themodel for the rolling mill and identifying the parameters ofthis model. Modeling is a recursive procedure and aafter the first itertion several changes of the model were necessary to obtain proper results. Since there are many things to vary in the model and in the way of doing the system identification, it is a complicated procedure to find the right set-up. It should be recognized that besides the control strategy many other things have been gainedfrom th work with the problem. For instance the knowledge {{of the nature of the}} rolling process have increased significantly in connection with the modeling and system identification...|$|E
40|$|A {{fuzzy logic}} {{controller}} (FLC) scheme {{has been developed}} for laser welding. Process light emissions are measured and combined to determine {{the current status of}} the welding process. If the process is not in a desired welding state, the FLC will adapt the laser power. The FLC has been demonstrated for the laser welding of zinc coated steel sheets in an overlap configuration. Experiments showed that the controller is capable of steering the process towards full penetration keyhole welding, avoiding both blowholes as well as lack of penetration. Under the presence of different process disturbances, like changes in focal position and material <b>thickness,</b> the <b>controller</b> proved to be able to maintain full penetration keyhole welding. The architecture of the controller is generic, thus facilitating an implementation for the laser welding process of other materials or configuration...|$|R
40|$|A {{compound}} {{control strategy}} is investigated for Medium Density Fiberboard (MDF) continuous hot pressing electrohydraulic servo system (EHSS) with uncertainties and input saturation. Firstly, a hyperbolic tangent function {{is applied to}} approximate saturation nonlinearity in the system. And thus the mathematical model is continuous and differentiable. Subsequently, the slab <b>thickness</b> tracking <b>controller</b> is constructed by using a dynamic surface control (DSC) method, which introduces first-order low-pass filters to calculate derivatives of virtual control input in each step. Compared with the conventional backstepping controller, complexity of the design procedure is alleviated obviously. Moreover, a composite disturbance of uncertainties and input saturation is estimated by a nonlinear disturbance observer for compensation of the control law. Finally, an appropriate Lyapunov function is chosen to prove that all signals of the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded and the tracking error converges to zero asymptotically. Numerical simulation results are also exhibited to authenticate and validate {{the benefits of the}} proposed control scheme...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{this study}} we propose a novel monitor {{hydraulic}} automatic gauge control (HAGC) system based on fuzzy feedforward controller. This {{is used in the}} development of cold rolling mill automation system {{to improve the quality of}} cold strip. According to features / properties of entry steel strip like its average yield stress, width of strip, and desired exit <b>thickness,</b> this <b>controller</b> realizes the compensation for the exit thickness error. The traditional methods of adjusting the roller position, can’t tolerate the variance in the entry steel strip. The proposed method uses a mathematical model of the system together with the expert knowledge to perform this adjustment while minimizing the effect of the stated problem. In order to improve the speed of the controller in rejecting disturbances introduced by entry strip thickness variations, expert knowledge is added as a feed-forward term to the HAGC system. Simulation results for the application of the proposed controller to a real cold mill show that the exit strip quality is highly improved. Keywords—Fuzzy feed-forward controller, monitor HAGC system, dynamic mathematical model, entry strip thickness deviation compensation S I...|$|R

Based on the {{analysis}} of thickness control theory, a controller combined fuzzy neural network with intellectual integration was designed in consideration of the nonlinear, large time delay, varying time characteristics of tandem cold mill <b>thickness</b> control. The <b>controller</b> adopted three layers BP network to realize fuzzy control and linked with intelligent integration in parallel for forming a three-dimensional full intelligent composite controller which enables the cold tandem rolling thickness fuzzy neural network control based on intelligent integration.

40|$|Mathematical {{model of}} rolling process is used at cold mill rolling on tandemmills in metallurgy. The model {{goal is to}} analyse rolling process {{according}} to process datameasured on the mill and get immeasurable variables necessary for rolling control andoptimal mill pre-set for next rolled coil. The values obtained by model are used asreferences for superimposed technology <b>controllers</b> (<b>thickness,</b> speed, tension, etc.) as well. Considering wide steel strip assortment (different initial and final thickness, differenthardness), and fluctuation of tandem mill parameters (change of friction coefficient, workrolls abrasion, temperature fluctuation, etc.) the exact analysis of tandem is complicated. The paper deals with an identification of friction coefficient on a single rolling mill standby a genetic algorithm. Mathematical description of tandem mill stand is based on themodified Bland-Ford model. Results are presented in graphical form...|$|R
40|$|We {{experimentally}} demonstrate perfect {{absorption of}} incident light in an ultrathin, planar organic layer, together with large photoluminescence (PL) enhancement. We find that diverse features {{appear in the}} absorption spectra of J-aggregate excitonic films, depending on the incident light angle and the phase <b>controller</b> <b>thickness.</b> We achieve strong absorption even away from the excitonic absorption pole. We explain the angle-dependent perfect absorption by comparing radiative and nonradiative damping rates for different incident angles. Moreover, we achieve large PL enhancement at strong light absorption conditions. This demonstrates that the absorbed light energy in excitonic perfect absorbers can be retrieved, unlike other perfect absorbers based on metal nanostructures where the absorbed energy is mainly dissipated as heat due to ohmic losses. Excitonic perfect absorbers can be useful for energy conversion devices or fluorescence-based optical devices...|$|R
5000|$|A {{thickness}} monitor measures {{how much}} material deposited on its sensor. Most deposition processes {{are at least}} somewhat directional. The sensor and the sample generally cannot {{be in the same}} direction from the deposition source (if they were, the one closer to the source would shadow the other), and may not even be at the same distance from it. Therefore, {{the rate at which the}} material is deposited on the sensor may not equal the rate at which it is deposited on the sample. The ratio of the two rates is sometimes called the [...] "tooling factor". For careful work, the tooling factor should be checked by measuring the amount of material deposited on some samples after the fact and comparing it to what the thickness monitor measured. Fizeau interferometers are often used to do this. Many other techniques might be used, depending on the thickness and characteristics of the thin film, including surface profilers, ellipsometry, dual polarisation interferometry and scanning electron microscopy of cross-sections of the sample. Many <b>thickness</b> monitors and <b>controllers</b> allow tooling factors to be entered into the device before deposition begins.|$|R
