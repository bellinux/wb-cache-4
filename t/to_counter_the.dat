5|$|Proposals for a UNPA {{date back}} to the UN's {{formation}} in 1945, but largely stagnated until the 1990s.

5|$|American policymakers, {{including}} Kennan and John Foster Dulles, {{acknowledged that}} the Cold War was in its essence a war of ideas. The United States, acting through the CIA, funded {{a long list of}} projects <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> communist appeal among intellectuals in Europe and the developing world.

5|$|An initial UN counteroffensive out of Masan proved {{ineffective}} in stopping the North Koreans from advancing. In the subsequent fight, the 35th Infantry {{was able to}} repel the North Koreans at the Battle of Nam River and were highly regarded for these actions. However, the 24th Infantry performed very poorly at the battles of Blue Mountain and Haman, forcing the 25th Division to muster reserves <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> North Korean gains against the 24th.|$|E
5|$|As a prisoner, he battled starvation, {{receiving}} {{only a small}} meal of mush {{served in}} a tin cup—a utensil he kept {{for the rest of}} his life. With a weight below , Buckles developed beriberi, and led fellow captives in calisthenics <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> effects of imprisonment. Their captors showed little mercy, but Buckles was allowed to grow a small garden, which he often used to help feed children who were imprisoned there.|$|E

5|$|During mid- to late-1943 the Home Fleet, the Royal Navy's main {{striking}} force {{stationed in the}} United Kingdom, was augmented by two forces of United States Navy warships to replace British ships dispatched to the Mediterranean and Pacific.

5|$|During the half-time interval, a row erupted {{between the}} Birmingham manager {{and some of}} his players about their fitness; in the Manchester City {{dressing}} room, a heated exchange took place between Barnes and Revie. Barnes had played defensively in the first half <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> threat of Peter Murphy, but Revie urged him to play further forward. Meanwhile, manager Les McDowall exhorted his players to keep possession and make their opponents chase the ball.|$|E
5|$|During the night, another storm broke (this time {{probably}} a thunder-storm, possibly with a south easterly wind), preventing the Allies from setting off southwards <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> Persian detachment sent {{around the outside}} of Euboea. However, the storm also hit the Persian detachment of ships, driving them off course and onto the rocky coast of 'the Hollows' of Euboea. This part of the Persian fleet was thus also shipwrecked, losing most of the ships.|$|E

5|$|In 1806, a British {{expeditionary force}} invaded Buenos Aires. A 13-year-old Rosas served distributing {{ammunition}} to troops in a force organised by Viceroy Santiago Liniers <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> invasion.

5|$|In 1943 the Royal Navy {{commissioned}} six {{light aircraft}} carriers {{in an effort}} <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> German and Japanese navies. The 1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier, {{commonly referred to as}} the British Light Fleet Carrier, was the result. Serving with eight navies between 1944 and 2001, these ships were designed and constructed by civilian shipyards as an intermediate step between the full-sized fleet aircraft carriers and the less expensive but limited-capability escort carriers.|$|E

5|$|In late January 1945 the Imperial General Headquarters belatedly {{adopted a}} civil defense plan <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> American air raids. This plan {{assigned}} responsibility for fighting fires to community councils and neighborhood {{groups as the}} professional firefighting units were short-handed. Civilians were to observe a blackout from 10:00pm. Japanese positions in the Bonin Islands were normally able to provide an hour's warning of American raids and air raid sirens were sounded in cities threatened by attack.|$|E
5|$|In {{patients}} of normal intelligence, rumination {{is not an}} intentional behavior and is habitually reversed using diaphragmatic breathing <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> urge to regurgitate. Alongside reassurance, explanation and habit reversal, patients are shown how to breathe using their diaphragms prior to and during the normal rumination period. A similar breathing pattern {{can be used to}} prevent normal vomiting. Breathing in this method works by physically preventing the abdominal contractions required to expel stomach contents.|$|E
