5|$|Leslie, Tom (Aziz Ansari), and Jerry join Carl {{to take a}} tour of {{the park}} where Jerry was mugged. Carl says the area is largely {{unprotected}} due to budget cuts, so Leslie vows to get more funding. She appears on Pawnee Today, the local news show, saying the Pawnee government failed the parks and that security is poor. Paul (Phil Reeves), the city manager, is angry over the television appearance, but informs Leslie the stunt worked and the mayor is offering $2,500 to help fix the park. While at a press conference about the money, Jerry confesses to Leslie that he wasn't mugged: he dropped a breakfast burrito in a creek, then fell while trying <b>to</b> <b>grab</b> <b>it</b> and dislocated his shoulder. He fabricated the mugger story because he was embarrassed and didn't want everyone to make fun of him. Leslie angrily relates Jerry's story to Mark, but he stops her short when he says that Jerry was too scared of his co-workers to be honest with them. Leslie soon discovers Carl was offended by Leslie's statements about park security and plans to show footage of Jerry falling into the creek on Pawnee Today. Leslie negotiates with Carl to not show the event, and instead they talk during the show about how much they enjoyed the film Avatar, much to the anger of host Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins). As part of their deal to not show the tape, Leslie buys Carl a brand new security cart. Carl hands over the tape, which she agrees to throw away after she watches it one last time. The office goes back to mocking Jerry, but with less venom than before, while Jerry confides that he doesn't really care because he's just two years away from retiring on a full pension and enjoying a peaceful retirement.|$|E
5|$|While on a {{shopping}} {{trip to the}} Springfield Mall, Mr. Burns finds a penny in a water fountain and reaches in <b>to</b> <b>grab</b> <b>it</b> (fearing Ralph might take it) and falls in. The rushing water nearly drowns him, but Homer arrives and pulls {{him out of the}} water, saving Mr. Burns's life. To reward him, Mr. Burns offers to take Homer out to dinner. Homer says he likes Chicago deep dish pizza, so Mr. Burns takes him to Chicago on his private plane. On the plane, Homer is treated with luxury and gets serenaded by Lionel Richie. Homer has the time of his life in Chicago, but he becomes depressed on the return trip because he does not have the plane. Back in Springfield, Homer tells Marge that he is tired of being a normal person and becomes depressed. Marge, pitying for Homer, decides to help and hires him a life coach named Colby Kraus (Stephen Colbert), who will help with Homer's dream. Colby starts right away in his treatment with Homer by videotaping his every move. At the bowling alley and after watching Homer's daily habits for a few days, Colby realizes that bowling is the one thing Homer is good at and enjoys doing. He instructs Homer to wear his bowling shoes everywhere he goes to help instill confidence in everything he does. The bowling shoes work, Homer becomes a new man, and as a result he receives numerous new job offers. Homer decides to only go for an interview at Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing because he would be required to fly in the company jet as part of his new job, however, the Rich Texan does not hire him.|$|E
25|$|As soon as Bakari was sighted, {{a member}} of the rescue team threw her a life preserver, but the waters were too rough, and she was too {{exhausted}} <b>to</b> <b>grab</b> <b>it.</b> One of the sailors, Maturaffi Sélémane Libounah, jumped into the water and handed her a flotation device, after which they were both pulled safely aboard the Sima Com 2, where she was given dry blankets and a hot drink.|$|E

5000|$|In the mid '50s, Seymour {{was quoted}} as saying that Elvis Presley [...] "wouldn't last more than a year," [...] but later {{clarified}} that the comment was a gimmick <b>to</b> <b>grab</b> some headlines—and <b>it</b> worked.|$|R

25|$|England won the toss, {{chose to}} bat {{and made an}} {{impressive}} start to their innings, with the opening stand being worth 133 in 39 overs. Michael Vaughan played some exquisite shots, bringing back memories of his performances against India and Australia in 2002 {{when he reached the}} top of the world rankings. It took a freakish dismissal to remove him, the ball getting caught in the trousers of the short leg fielder who then managed <b>to</b> <b>grab</b> <b>it</b> before it hit the ground. Vaughan had made 87, and was very disappointed to have to leave the crease when he had the potential to make a very large score.|$|E
25|$|As the 19th century dawned, Florida {{had been}} undisputed Spanish {{territory}} for almost 250 years, aside from 20 years of British control between the French and Indian Wars and the American Revolution. Although a sparsely inhabited swampland, expansionist-minded Americans were eager <b>to</b> <b>grab</b> <b>it</b> and already, in 1808, American settlers had invaded the westernmost tip of Florida and expelled the local Spanish authorities, after which Congress hastily {{passed a bill}} annexing it under {{the claim that the}} Louisiana Purchase had guaranteed the territory to the United States. During the War of 1812, American troops occupied and seized the area around Mobile Bay. Spain, then engulfed in war with France, did not react to either of these actions. Also taking advantage of the mother country's distraction, Spain's Latin American colonies rose up in revolt and Madrid was forced to denude Florida of troops to suppress the rebellions. The result of this was that law and order practically broke down in Florida and a horde of Indians, pirates, and other troublemakers began raiding across the border into the US. In 1818, Andrew Jackson led an army into Florida to quell the chaotic situation there. He arrested and hanged two British agents who had been encouraging Indian raids, leading to an outcry in London and calls for war. However, cooler heads prevailed and the situation did not escalate further. A year later, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams negotiated the Adams-Onis Treaty with Spain. The Spanish agreed to turn over the no-longer-defensible Florida to the US and also give up their extremely flimsy claims to the distant Oregon Territory, in exchange for which American claims on Texas were renounced (some Americans had also been claiming parts of that territory under the Louisiana Purchase). The heretofore vague border between the US and Spanish North America was also settled upon. Although American designs on Texas did not disappear, they were put on the backburner for the more immediately important Florida.|$|E
500|$|Prey is {{most often}} caught on the ground, though {{occasionally}} they take birds in flight. [...] Before striking, the kestrel characteristically bobs its head and tail, then makes a direct flight toward the prey <b>to</b> <b>grab</b> <b>it</b> in its talons. Much like the red-tailed hawk, American kestrels conserve energy in a hunt and pick their attacks with care as to position and odds of success. During the breeding season, the bird will carry large prey back to its mate or young. One study found that an American kestrel pair [...] "foraged in ways that minimized the costs of energy acquisition in its particular situation". For example, if the success rate for catching prey decreases significantly in a particular area, the bird will move to a different area.|$|E

25|$|When taking {{food from}} a {{communal}} dish, {{unless they are}} family or very close friends, one should turn the chopsticks around <b>to</b> <b>grab</b> the food; <b>it</b> is considered more sanitary. Alternatively, one could have a separate set of chopsticks for communal dishes.|$|R
500|$|Further {{disappointment}} followed as the American 4 x 100m relay team, with Gay as anchor, {{failed to}} qualify for the final. Darvis Patton and Gay failed to pass on the baton in the heat. Gay personally took responsibility for the dropped baton but Patton denied this was true, saying [...] "That's Tyson Gay. He's a humble guy, but I know it's my job to get the guy the baton and I didn't do that." [...] After stating his desire to win four Olympic gold medals (by adding the 400 metres to his repertoire) earlier in the year, Gay finished the 2008 Olympics without a single medal. Having failed to reach the finals of the 100m sprint or relay, he reflected upon his failure to make the podium in Beijing: [...] " [...] then I went <b>to</b> <b>grab</b> <b>it</b> and there was nothing. It's kind of the way it's been happening to me this Olympics." ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Crystal Grab", the {{contestant}}s must fight to collect all the Crystals in the arena. When a contestant is attacked, they will drop any Crystals they've gathered, allowing opponents to steal them. This mode {{can be played}} free-for-all or with teams. In [...] "Capture the Flag", two teams attempt to capture each other's flag {{and bring it back}} to their respective flags. Players must race to their opponents' side of the map and drive over their flag <b>to</b> <b>grab</b> <b>it.</b> They must then drive over their own flag's base to score a point from the flag they've captured. A flag that has been stolen can be dropped if the thief is hit with any weapon. Stolen flags that have been dropped can be returned to their respective bases. Due to the weight of the flags, any kart with a flag will be slowed down. The game ends when time runs out or when one of the teams has gotten enough points. This mode can only be played in teams. [...] "Steal the Bacon" [...] is a variation of [...] "Capture the Flag" [...] in which two teams fight over one flag that is situated {{in the middle of the}} arena. The teams must attempt to take the flag and bring it to their respective base.|$|E

50|$|The fairy tern mainly {{feeds on}} fish which it catches by {{hovering}} over the sea before plunging beak first into the water <b>to</b> <b>grab</b> its prey. <b>It</b> seldom goes far out to sea but is often to be seen where predatory fish are feeding on shoals of small fish. It also consumes crustaceans, molluscs and some plant material.|$|R

50|$|A young woman, Allison Cowley (Mena Suvari), {{comes into}} the Santa Barbara, California police station {{claiming}} to have just escaped after being kidnapped and held by the notorious serial killer Mr. Yin. Shawn Spencer and the police are wary to believe Allison, as several others come into the station making similar claims involving the Yin case. While being questioned by Shawn and Gus, Allison describes being shackled to a radiator by Yin and shows them a bruised wrist as proof. She takes out a photograph, claiming <b>to</b> have <b>grabbed</b> <b>it</b> before escaping. Shawn is shocked to see a picture {{of himself as a}} child standing next to Mr. Yang (Ally Sheedy).|$|R

2500|$|They forage in sun flecks and {{the gaps}} created by fallen trees, {{where there is}} enough light to see spider webs. [...] Several species have been {{observed}} searching for webs by flying up {{one side of a}} tree and down the other side. [...] When they locate one they hover in front of it. [...] To catch a spider they first fly backward, then quickly fly forward <b>to</b> <b>grab</b> <b>it</b> in their forelegs. [...] Then they back away again and perch to consume the spider, removing the legs before eating the body. [...] Though this careful forward-and-back approach minimizes contact with the web, they often preen after eating to remove any strands that do adhere to them.|$|E
2500|$|Upon its release, I'm Serious {{received}} universal widespread {{critical acclaim}} from most music critics. Some critics, however, {{pointed to the}} fact that many of the tracks sounded the same and that a few were blatant rip-offs. Allmusic writer Jon Azpiri wrote [...] "T.I. claims to be the king of the South, but on I'm Serious he fails to show and prove. He does, however, have potential. If his talent ever matches his confidence, he may be headed for stardom." [...] Down-South gave the album a four out of five stars saying [...] "With his solo finally about to drop, this album should be his gateway into the mainstream arena. Overall, this album is all I expected plus more. I don't seen how anyone couldn't like it because it's [...] so much diversity. So when you see this album on store shelves, be sure <b>to</b> <b>grab</b> <b>it,</b> you won't be disappointed." ...|$|E
5000|$|Fetch {{is a game}} usually {{played with}} a dog.

2500|$|Around {{the same}} time, Pan demands that Gold {{help him get}} a heart before he leaves, and Pan offers his son Pandora's Box, in {{exchange}} for a heart, which will keep Belle safe on the return home. And as the others wait for Emma and Hook, Henry, and Regina decide that they should help continue helping the trapped residents resolve their unfinished business. Regina also convinces Robin to give his baby to Zelena so she and Hades can take care of her, but after he steps aside for a breath of fresh air, Gold shows up and takes his heart. Meanwhile, Henry, in his role as the Author, successfully helps the resident complete their [...] "unfinished business," [...] which will allow them to leave. However, Cruella and the Blind Witch lock the outsiders in the library, in their plot to take over the Underworld in Hades' absence, and to keep them away from the portal. Regina suspects the Blind Witch had help from Hades since she's doesn't usually cast that strong magic. As Emma and Hook continue the search for ambrosia, Emma physically weighs her heart to see if she is worthy as she places it on a scale but the weight is increasing her pain, and even Hook tries <b>to</b> <b>grab</b> <b>it</b> but he starts to catch fire. This has left Emma with two choices, saving her heart or Hook, and when she chooses the latter, a door opens as she is deemed worthy, only to discover that the tree had been cut down, and the leftover Ambrosia had been dead for a long time. The two suspect that Hades lied to them to prevent them from returning to Storybrooke.|$|E
