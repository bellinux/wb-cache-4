5|$|Blökumen are {{mentioned}} in the Flateyjarbók, an Icelandic manuscript from the late 14th century, which preserved a 13th-century biography of King Olaf of Norway. This work contains a separate chapter on the adventures of a Norwegian prince, Eymund, at the court of Prince Jarizleifr in Novgorod. The chapter narrates that Eymund informed Jarizleifr of the departure of Jarizleifr's brother, Burizlaf, to Tyrkland, and added that Burizlaf was preparing to attack Jarizleifr with a huge army formed by Tyrkir, Blökumen and other peoples. Curta, Spinei and other scholars identify Jarizleifr with Yaroslav the Wise, and Burizlaf with Sviatopolk I of Kiev. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reference to the Tyrkir and Blökumen proves that Sviatopolk I hired Pechenegs and Vlachs {{when he decided to}} go to war with Yaroslav. Furthermore, they propose that the Blökumenn of the Flatey Book, like the Blakumen of the runic inscription from Gottland, were Vlachs from Moldavia or Wallachia.|$|E
5|$|The company DuPont {{and many}} {{industrial}} historians dispute {{a link between}} nylon and hemp. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reason for developing nylon was to produce a fiber that could compete with silk and rayon in, for example, thin stockings for women. Silk was much more expensive than hemp and imported largely from Japan. There was more money in a substitute for silk. DuPont focused early on thin stockings for women. As a commercial product, nylon was a revolution in textiles. Strong and water-resistant, {{it was possible to}} make very thin fibers from cheap raw materials. The first sales in 1938 in New York of nylon stockings created a line with 4000 middle class women. For years to come, nylon demand was greater than DuPont could produce. And the DuPont Group was very big; it could move on if nylon had not become a success.|$|E

5|$|While {{reports by}} owners of fitting names are of interest, some {{scientists}} have questioned their value {{in deciding whether}} nominative determinism is a real effect. Instead, <b>they</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> claim that a name affects life decisions is an extraordinary one that requires extraordinary evidence. To select only those cases that seem to give evidence for nominative determinism is to ignore those that do not. Analysis {{of large numbers of}} names is therefore needed. In 2002 Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones analysed various databases containing first names, surnames, occupations, cities and states. In one study they concluded that people named Dennis gravitate towards dentistry. They did this by retrieving the number of dentists called Dennis (482) from a database of US dentists. They then used the 1990 Census to find out which male first name was the next most popular after Dennis: Walter. The likelihood of a US male being called Dennis was 0.415% and the likelihood of a US male being called Walter was 0.416%. The researchers then retrieved the number of dentists called Walter (257). Comparing the relative frequencies of Dennis and Walter led them to their conclusion that the name Dennis is over-represented in dentistry. However, in 2011, Uri Simonsohn published a paper in which he criticized Pelham et al. for not considering confounding factors and reported on how the popularity of Dennis and Walter as baby names has varied over the decades. Given Walter was a relatively old-fashioned name it was far more likely for Pelham et al. to find people named Dennis to have any job, not just that of dentist, and people named Walter to be retired. Simonsohn did indeed find a disproportionally high number of Dennis lawyers compared to Walter lawyers.|$|E

50|$|VCCL and Vadarlis {{made two}} main arguments. Firstly, <b>they</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{provisions}} of the Migration Act 1958 (which regulates immigration) applied to the asylum seekers, and the normal procedures for dealing with other non-citizens should be applied. The Migration Act did empower the Government to detain all non-citizens, under the system of mandatory detention, but it also gave non-citizens certain rights, such {{as the right to}} seek asylum and to apply for protection visas. As such, <b>they</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> asylum seekers should be taken to the mainland and be allowed to apply for visas. Alternatively, <b>they</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> if <b>the</b> Migration Act did not apply to the situation of these asylum seekers, then they were being detained unlawfully, and that no-one in Australia, regardless of their citizenship status, could be detained unlawfully or arbitrarily, and so they should be released.|$|R
25|$|In fifteen chapters, Acemoglu and Robinson try {{to examine}} which factors are {{responsible}} for the political and economical success or failure of states. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> existing explanations about the emergence of prosperity and poverty, e.g. geography, climate, culture, religion, or the ignorance of political leaders are either insufficient or defective in explaining it.|$|E
25|$|The Pennsylvania Avenue closing {{has been}} opposed by {{organized}} civic groups in Washington, D.C. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> closing impedes traffic flow unnecessarily and {{is inconsistent with}} the well-conceived historic plan for the city.

25|$|Modern {{scholars}} tend {{to reject}} these approaches {{stating that the}} Matthew account is a midrashic exposition that allows the author to present the event as a fulfillment of prophetic passages from the Old Testament. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> author adds imaginative details such as the thirty pieces of silver, {{and the fact that}} Judas hangs himself, to an earlier tradition about Judas's death.|$|E

25|$|Both Plato and Aristotle {{argue against}} some of Protagoras's claims {{regarding}} relativity; however, <b>they</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> concept provides Protagoras with too convenient an exemption from his own theory and that relativism is true for him yet false {{for those who do}} not believe it. They claim that by asserting that truth is relative, Protagoras then could say that whatever further theory he proposed must be true.|$|E
25|$|Many {{animal welfare}} groups, campaigners and activists believe that fox hunting is unfair and cruel to animals. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> chase itself causes fear and {{distress}} {{and that the}} fox is not always killed instantly as is claimed. Animal rights campaigners also object to fox hunting, {{on the grounds that}} animals should enjoy some basic rights (such as the right to freedom from exploitation and the right to life).|$|E

25|$|During the 20th century, certain sects {{affiliated}} with the Black nationalist Moorish Science philosophy theorized an association with the Mound Builders. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Mound Builders were an ancient advanced Black civilization that developed the legendary continents of Atlantis and Mu, as well as ancient Egypt and Mesoamerica. These black groups claim that the American Indians were too primitive to have developed the sophisticated societies and the technology believed necessary to build the mounds.|$|E
25|$|Some critics {{believe that}} CSR {{programs}} are undertaken by companies {{to distract the}} public from ethical questions posed by their core operations. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reputational benefits that CSR companies receive (cited above as a benefit to the corporation) demonstrate the hypocrisy of the approach. Moreover, some studies find that CSR programs are motivated by corporate managers' personal interests {{at the cost of}} the shareholders so they are a type of an agency problem in corporations.|$|E
25|$|Individuals such as Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu, Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman and MKs Tzipi Hotovely, Ofir Akunis and Fania Kirshenbaum have {{supported}} the proposed legislation. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> legislation prevents foreign governments and organizations from unduly influencing Israel's domestic affairs. The legislation has encountered notable resistance from within Israel itself and abroad. The governments of the United Kingdom and the United States warned Benyamin Netanyahu that the adoption of such measures would harm Israel's standing in the West as a democratic country.|$|E

25|$|One {{solution}} for some resources is to convert common good into private property, giving {{the new owner}} an incentive to enforce its sustainability. Libertarians and classical liberals cite {{the tragedy of the}} commons as an example of what happens when Lockean property rights to homestead resources are prohibited by a government. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> solution to the tragedy of the commons is to allow individuals to take over the property rights of a resource, that is, to privatize it.|$|E
25|$|The {{accounts}} as {{to which}} side fired the first shot vary considerably to this day. According to Peru's version Ecuadorian troops invaded Peruvian territory in the Zarumilla province, which started a battle that spread to a zone known as Quebrada Seca (dry creek). But Ecuador's version is that Peru took a series of incidents between border patrols as a pretext to invade Ecuador, {{with the intention of}} forcing it to sign a clear border agreement. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> clear disparity of military presence in the region between the two countries supports this version.|$|E
25|$|A {{third group}} makes little {{distinction}} between debt and taxes, this group emphasizes reduction in spending rather than tax policy or debt reduction. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> true cost {{of government is}} the level of spending not how that spending is financed. Every dollar that the government spends is a dollar taken from American workers, regardless whether it is from debt or taxes. Taxes simply redistribute purchasing power, doing so in a particularly inefficient manner, reducing the incentives to produce or hire and borrowing simply forces businesses and investors to anticipate higher taxes later on.|$|E
