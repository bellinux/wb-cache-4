500|$|Albini {{sought to}} produce a record that sounded nothing like Nevermind. [...] He felt the sound of Nevermind was [...] "sort of a {{standard}} hack recording that {{has been turned into}} a very, very controlled, compressed radio-friendly mix [...] That is not, in my opinion, very flattering to a rock band." [...] Instead, the intention was to capture a more natural and visceral sound. [...] Albini refused to double-track Cobain's vocals and instead recorded him singing alone in a resonant room. [...] The producer noted the intensity of the singer's vocals on some tracks; he said, [...] "There's a really dry, really loud voice at the end of 'Milk It'... that was also done at the end of 'Rape Me', where [...] wanted the sound of him screaming to just overtake the whole band." [...] Albini achieved the album's sparse drum sound by simply placing several microphones around the room while Dave Grohl performed, picking up the natural reverberation of the room. [...] Albini explained, [...] "If you take a good drummer and put him in front of a drum kit <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>good</b> acoustically and just record it, you've done your job." ...|$|E

50|$|The subdivisions of the Mesoproterozoic are {{arbitrary}} divisions {{based on}} time. They are not geostratigraphic or biostratigraphic units. The {{base of the}} Mesoproterozoic is defined chronometrically, in terms of years, {{rather than by the}} appearance or disappearance of some organism. This gives an illusory sense of certainty. Radiometric dating is a good tool, and gets better each decade. This creates some problems. As a practical matter, radiometric dates have an error margin of 1-2%. <b>That</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>good,</b> but it means that two sites, both measured to be at the exact base of the Ectasian, might differ in age by over 50 My. Since the Ectasian is only 200 My long, these differences dramatically influence its timescale. And this accounts only for random error, ignoring systematic errors.Systematic errors can be caused by extraterrestrial events, by geochemical or biochemical sorting of isotopes, and human error. Thus far, biostratigraphy has usually proved considerably more exact. In addition, a thoughtful choice of biological marker {{can be used as a}} signal to expect a whole host of ecological changes. The difference between a Changhsingian and an Induan deposit isn't just a matter of a few years. The world changed significantly at the end of the Permian.|$|E

We were throwing out names, and when we got to Clarksdale, we thought Clarksville sounded even better. We didn't know it at the time, but there is an Army base near the town of Clarksville, Tennessee — which would have fit the bill fine for the story line. We couldn't be too direct with The Monkees. We couldn't really make a protest song out of it — we kind of snuck it in." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked why}} they wear masks, Flaubert replied: The answer <b>that</b> makes me <b>sound</b> <b>good</b> is <b>that</b> we desired to {{circumvent}} the cult of personality that is inherent in rock music by choosing to remain anonymous. Unlike every other band in rock we chose to be anonymous. The answer <b>that</b> makes me <b>sound</b> <b>good</b> would probably also incorporate some lengthy discussion about Brechtian alienation techniques, about our post modernistgrasp of ever cooling universe, and a dehumanising society encapsulated in the somewhat paramilitary aspect of our clothing. All of those things would make me <b>sound</b> <b>good,</b> but actually we’re really boring guys." [...] Humphrey B. Flaubert ...|$|R

[...] Hugh Montgomery of The Observer opined that [...] "on its own limited terms, it's a job well done." [...] While calling her first album [...] "the Obligation", her second [...] "the Breakthrough", and her third [...] "the Reaction," [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times noted that All I Ever Wanted [...] "plays out as Ms. Clarkson’s Concession," [...] pointing out that [...] "Ms. Clarkson’s identity is finally firm: spurned, hurt and torn." ...|$|E
40|$|Collection of {{artifacts}} from the GroupLoops team project in the GROCS 2008 - 2009 cycle. Learning how to play an instrument and compose music {{takes a long time}} and a lot of effort. Electronic devices lower the barrier to music creation by removing procedural technique from this learning curve. However, music composition software shares a different barrier with instruments: It’s hard to learn how to make a musical work <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>good.</b> Our research will explore how the iPhone and iPod Touch could teach music theory while participants collaborate on a group track. The experience might be similar to a jam session, but with digital instruments that fit in your pocket and don’t require years of practice to play well. We’ll use interaction design methods like contextual inquiry, prototyping, and user testing to research and develop an interface that’s easy to use, instructional via constraints and recommendations, and fun. Our goal is to develop a proof-of-concept for co-located, synchronous, and collaborative music composition software for the iPhone and iPod Touch that would educate and inspire creativity in music theory novices...|$|E
