40|$|Abstract A {{quantum theory}} of retarded surface plas-mons on a metal–vacuum {{interface}} is formulated, by analogy with the well-known and widely exploited the-ory of exciton-polaritons. The Hamiltonian for mutually interacting instantaneous surface plasmons and <b>transverse</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>modes</b> is diagonalized with recourse to a Hopfield–Bogoljubov transformation, {{in order to}} obtain a new family of modes, to be identified with retarded plas-mons. The interaction with nearby dipolar emitters is treated with a full quantum formalism based on a general defi-nition of modal effective volumes. The illustrative cases of a planar surface and of a spherical nanoparticle are considered in detail. In the ideal situation of absence of dissipation, as an effect of the conservation of in-plane wavevector, retarded plasmons on a planar surface repre-sent true stationary states (which are usually called surface plasmon polaritons), whereas retarded plasmons in a spher-ical nanoparticle, characterized by frequencies that overlap with the <b>transverse</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> continuum, become res-onances with a finite radiative broadening.

These initial efforts include setting up the EMI measurement facilities, developing EMI measurement techniques, and performing radiated emission tests on a motor controller, which is a hard-switching device. 5 EMI MEASUREMENT FACILITIES SSC San Diego started to construct a building and purchase and set up the measurement facilities in May 1997. The EMI measurement facilities include the EMCO Gigahertz <b>Transverse</b> <b>Electromagnetic</b> <b>Mode</b> (GTEM) cell, converter, cooling system, filters for power lines, and signal generators. The building construction and installation of the EMCO Gigahertz <b>Transverse</b> <b>Electromagnetic</b> <b>Mode</b> (GTEM) cell were completed in October 1997 (figures 1 through 5). The GTEM cell is a field-generating device that represents a significant advance in state-of-the-art EMC testing. It characterizes PEBB for application of EMC in existing and advanced shipboard electric power systems. Measurement techniques for radiated emission and susceptibility levels for PEBB and other shipboard RF equipment can be developed. Acceptable radiated emission and susceptibility levels for PEBB and other shipboard RF equipment can be established. The GTEM provides a controlled, low-ambient environment for quickly performing both emissions and immunity testing in the same cell with minimal change in the test setup. The usable bandwidth is DC to 20 GHz for immunity testing and 9 kHz to 5 GHz for emissions testing. Typical voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) is {{less than or equal to}} 1. 5 : 1.

These waves may cause significant coupling in the power-ground cavity, leading to electromagnetic reliability (EMR) issues such as simultaneous switching noise coupling, high insertion loss degradation of signal vias, and stray radiation from the periphery/edges of the package/board. In this contribution, we model and quantify EMR problems caused by uncontrolled return currents of signal vias in conventional multilayer stack-ups. Traditional methods used to minimize these problems, and their limitations are discussed.
