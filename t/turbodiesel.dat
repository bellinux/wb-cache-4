5|$|Storm II is also {{produced}} in an armoured version, and is offered with an optional 2.8litre VM Motori <b>turbodiesel,</b> automatic transmission, right hand drive, and run-flat tyres. AIL {{is capable of}} completing ten vehicles daily. Due to recently passed tax laws, a civilian version is not yet available in the local market.|$|E
5|$|A Storm Mark III {{was set to}} be {{produced}} for the Israeli defense forces starting in June 2008, when the IDF was to purchase around 600 vehicles beginning in early 2011. Based on the then new four-door Jeep Wrangler JK design, the Mark III is meant {{to address some of}} the shortfalls of the earlier Mark II. Whereas the previous vehicle was an update of the original TK Storm, the Storm III was designed from the outset with a five-door configuration. Unlike the TJ-L, the new JK Storm has a much higher maximum load capacity in part due to heavier-duty shock absorbers, springs and axles, necessary for an armored version. It includes a standard 2.8L VM Motori <b>turbodiesel</b> and automatic transmission.|$|E

25|$|A new {{diesel-powered}} Cruze will {{be available}} in 2017. It will have the 1.6L <b>turbodiesel</b> also found in the 2018 Equinox, paired to either a nine-speed automatic or six-speed manual transmission.|$|E
25|$|The four-cylinder overhead-valve engines, both petrol and diesel, {{which first}} {{appeared}} (in diesel form) in 1957, {{near the end}} of Series One production, and evolved over the years to the 300 TDi <b>turbodiesel,</b> which remains in production today for some overseas markets.|$|E
25|$|The <b>turbodiesel,</b> a {{first on}} an Alfa Romeo's {{passenger}} car, was of 2.0 litres and produced 82PS. The Alfetta Turbo D was sold mostly in Italy and in France, {{as well as}} a few other continental European markets where the tax structure suited this model.|$|E
2500|$|Three engine {{options were}} {{originally}} {{available for the}} Evoque: two 2.2-litre <b>turbodiesels</b> producing either , or , and a 2-litre [...] turbocharged petrol engine.|$|R
50|$|At the time, {{metal and}} bearing {{technology}} was not sufficiently advanced {{to allow a}} practical turbocharger to be built. The first practical <b>turbodiesels</b> were marine engines fitted to two German passenger liners - the Danzig and the Preussen in 1923, each having two 10-cylinder engines of 2,500 horsepower (the naturally aspirated {{version of the same}} engine produced 1,750 HP). By the late 1920s, several diesel engine builders were making large <b>turbodiesels</b> for marine and stationary use, such as Sulzer Bros., MAN, Daimler-Benz, and Paxman.|$|R
50|$|Improvements in power, fuel economy, and noise, vibration, and {{harshness}} in both small- and large-capacity <b>turbodiesels</b> {{over the}} last decade have spurred their widespread adoption in certain markets, notably in Europe where they (as of 2014) make up over 50% of new car registrations. <b>Turbodiesels</b> are generally considered more flexible for automotive uses than naturally aspirated diesels, which have strong low-speed torque outputs but lack power at higher speeds. <b>Turbodiesels</b> can be designed to have a more acceptable spread of both power and torque over their speed range or, if being built for commercial use, can be designed to improve either torque or power at a given speed depending on the exact use. Naturally aspirated diesels, almost without exception, have a lower power output than a petrol engine of the same capacity whilst the same time requiring stronger (and thus heavier) internal components such as the pistons and crankshaft to withstand the greater stresses of the diesel engine's operating cycle. These factors give naturally aspirated diesels a poor power-to-weight ratio. Turbocharger units weigh very little but can offer significant power, torque, and efficiency improvements. Fitting a turbocharger can bring a diesel engine's power-to-weight ratio up to the same level as an equivalent petrol unit, making <b>turbodiesels</b> desirable for automotive use, where manufacturers aim for comparable power outputs and handling qualities across their range, regardless of the type of power unit chosen.|$|R
25|$|The 75 engine range at launch {{featured}} four-cylinder 1.6-, 1.8- and 2.0-litre petrol carbureted engines, a 2.0-litre intercooled <b>turbodiesel</b> made by VM Motori, and a 2.5-litre {{fuel injected}} V6. In 1986, the 75 Turbo was introduced, which featured a fuel-injected 1779 cc twin-cam engine using Garrett T3 turbocharger, intercooler and oil cooler.|$|E
25|$|From 1998 the Td5 {{engine was}} fitted to Land Rover products. Whilst this 5-cylinder <b>turbodiesel</b> was {{unrelated}} {{in any way}} to the 4-cylinder designs and was originally intended for use in both Rover Cars and Land Rover 4×4s it only reached production in its Land Rover form. It was produced between 1998 and 2007, and 310,000 Td5s were built.|$|E
25|$|General Motors {{launched}} the diesel version of Chevrolet Beat in the Indian auto market on July 25, 2011. The 3-cylinder, 936 cc <b>turbodiesel</b> engine produces 62.5 PS and 160.26 Nm of torque, resulting in good acceleration and pick up. The 1.0 L, 936 cc diesel engine enables {{the car to}} reach 100km/h in 16 seconds and {{a top speed of}} 143km/h. Chevrolet Beat Diesel offers mileage of 24 kpl (56 mpg) as per the ARAI (Automotive Research Association of India) test reports. The engine is based on the Fiat Multijet diesel technology.|$|E
50|$|Cylinder {{heads are}} built in {{aluminium}} alloy. Petrol versions have an integrated coolant pump and pentroof combustion chambers with an angle of 47° between valves. The <b>turbodiesels</b> have a different, flat combustion chamber design.|$|R
50|$|The Fiat 500X is {{available}} with several engines with optional {{all wheel drive}} with most. At launch, engines available outside of North America included: one petrol, the turbocharged 1.4 MultiAir2, and two MultiJet <b>turbodiesels</b> displacing 1.6 and 2.0 litres.|$|R
50|$|Turbocharger {{technology}} was improved greatly by developments during World War II and subsequent {{development of the}} gas turbine. It was now possible to use smaller turbochargers on smaller, higher-speed engines. Diesel locomotives with <b>turbodiesels</b> began appearing in the late 1940s and 1950s.|$|R
25|$|The {{range was}} {{available}} with 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0L petrol engines, with the 1.8-litre four available with an optional turbocharger. The VG20ET V6 was offered {{for the first}} time in Japan in 1984, in a model with an extended front end, called the Bluebird Maxima. This 2-litre V6 was available naturally aspirated or as an intercooled turbo. The U11 Maxima featured a larger 3.0L VG30E. There were also naturally aspirated or turbocharged 2-litre diesels. Counterintuitively, the <b>turbodiesel</b> had better gas mileage in standardized test cycles, presumably due to it being less stressed – as long as one did not take full advantage of its better performance.|$|E
25|$|Land Rover's global sales {{collapsed}} {{during the}} early 1980s. This was mainly due to foreign competition offering larger, more powerful, more comfortable vehicles. Land Rover suffered from poor build quality and materials during the 1970s and by 1983 the then-current Series III model was distinctly outdated, despite recent improvements. Land Rover decided to focus the sales of its Ninety/One Ten/127 range on the UK and Europe, for which it required a diesel engine with significantly better performance than the 68-horsepower 2.5-litre type then in production. Project Falcon was started in 1984 to develop a turbocharged version of this engine. The resulting engine was Land Rover's first production <b>turbodiesel</b> and their first engine {{to be given a}} marketing name- the Diesel Turbo, a name given to differentiate it from the VM Motori-built <b>turbodiesel</b> then being used in the Range Rover, which was sold as the 'Turbo D'. The Diesel Turbo, although essentially the same as the 2.5-litre diesel, had numerous additions and modifications to allow it to cope with the stresses of turbocharging. New pistons with Teflon-coated crowns and Nimonic steel exhaust valves were used to withstand higher combustion temperatures. The crankshaft was cross-drilled for improved strength and cooling. The block was modified to allow an oil feed/drain system to the turbocharger, and the cooling system was improved with an 8-bladed viscous fan and integral oil cooler. The engine was fitted with a high-capacity breather system to cope with the greater volumes of gas flow through the engine. Despite the inherent age of the design, it performed well in tests against its rivals and provided the vital blend of performance and economy the Land Rover had needed for many years. It was the first diesel model to match the petrol engine's 4-ton towing limit and the first to be able to exceed the UK national speed limit of 70mph (112km/h). However, early engines suffered several failures. Most serious were failed main and big-end bearings and splits or cracks in the block. In 1988 a new block and an improved design of bearing and bearing cap was fitted which solved these issues. The engine's higher internal temperatures meant that the cooling system also had to be maintained to a much higher standard than the earlier engines. Further changes were made in 1989, this time to the breather system to prevent oil being drawn into the air filter. Despite these issues, the Diesel Turbo was a strong seller. It was the standard engine for the UK and European markets and Land Rover's sales increased after its introduction. Time has shown that these engines can turn in long service lives if maintained as required—like many early turbodiesels, a lack of maintenance causes failure.|$|E
25|$|In 1989 Land Rover had {{launched}} the Discovery its Range Rover-based family 4×4 that quickly became Europe's top-selling 4×4. One {{of the key}} reasons for its success was its ground-breaking <b>turbodiesel</b> engine. The 200Tdi {{was one of the}} first mass-produced small-capacity (i.e., not a lorry engine) direct-injection diesels, with the attendant improvements in power and efficiency that system brings. Developed under the codename Gemini, the 200Tdi was planned from the start to be used on all Land Rover's products. For production reasons, it had to be machined on the existing machinery, so used the same block and crankshaft as the existing 2.5-litre diesel engines. It also used many ancillary parts used on the older engines. However, it was a true break with the past. An aluminium alloy cylinder head reduced weight and noise, a new Bosch injection system gave improved running characteristics and better starting performance. An intercooler boosted power and efficiency further. Lessons learnt from the Diesel Turbo were included, such as the fitment of an inertial separator in the breather system to remove oil before crankcase gases were returned to the air intake. Initially turbocharged and naturally aspirated diesel versions and a carburettor-fed petrol version were to be produced. The direct-injection system meant that only machining of the injector sockets was needed to allow the fitment of spark plugs. However, the performance and economy of the <b>turbodiesel</b> version was such that the other variants were not produced. The 200Tdi was launched in the Discovery in 1989. It was then fitted to the utility Land Rover (renamed the Defender) in late 1990. For this application the engine was slightly de-tuned and, whilst in the Discovery the 200Tdi used all-new components, packaging restraints in the Defender meant that the 200Tdi in this role shared many exterior parts (such as the timing belt system and case) with the Diesel Turbo. Most obviously the turbocharger was retained in the Diesel Turbo's high mounting position on top of the manifolds in the Defender, rather than being tucked under the manifolds in the original Discovery version. In 1992 the engine was fitted to the Range Rover. Although the older petrol and naturally aspirated diesel units were theoretically still available, the 200Tdi had better performance and economy than any of them, and so dominated the sales figures. It is still highly regarded by Land Rover enthusiasts and has established itself as a powerful and long-lived unit that with proper maintenance can exceed 300,000 miles of use. The engine's commonality with the older models makes it a popular choice for installation in older Land Rovers. This is done both in original form or with the turbo removed (when the engine becomes known to enthusiasts as a 200Di) in order to keep the power/torque output within the limits of a Series Land Rover's gearbox and for greater ease of conversion. The turbocharged version may also be installed with or without the intercooler.|$|E
50|$|US sales {{began in}} early January 2013. In the UK and Australia, the fourth {{generation}} RAV4 {{went on sale}} in February. Engine choices include a 2.0- and 2.5-litre four-cylinder gasoline, and 2.0- and 2.2-litre <b>turbodiesels.</b> Transmissions include a six-speed manual, Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), and six-speed automatic.|$|R
50|$|The {{straight}} four engine range includes 1.4, 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0 litre petrol engines {{as well as}} 1.6, 1.9 and 2.0 litre <b>turbodiesels,</b> {{and regular}} diesels, and in some countries, a 1.5 litre TUD diesel engine. The Xsara was 1998 Semperit Irish Car of the Year in Ireland.|$|R
50|$|In 1982, Alfetta and Giulietta <b>turbodiesels</b> {{achieved}} seven world speed records over 5/10/25/50 thousand kilometres and 5/10/25 {{thousand miles}} at Nardò (Lecce). While {{one of the}} quickest diesels in its category at the time, the Giulietta was rather costly and suffered from a very forward weight distribution (56.9 per cent over the front wheels).|$|R
25|$|Land Rover's radically updated {{product line}} was {{launched}} in 1983. Initially only the long-wheelbase One Ten was available and it was sold with the same engine line-up as the preceding Series III model- 2.25-litre petrol and diesel engines and the 3.5-litre Rover V8. However, Land Rover planned a series of rolling improvements. Launched shortly before the short-wheelbase Ninety model in 1984 was a 2.5-litre diesel engine. This {{was little more than}} an updated version of the existing diesel unit (at this time 22 years old). The stroke was lengthened to improve torque, and an updated cylinder head was used to reduce noise and emissions. A more modern injector pump improved fuel economy and an improved glow plug system improved cold-starting performance. The most significant change was the swapping of the chain-driven camshaft for one driven by a fibre toothed belt, which also drove the repositioned injector pump. The drive vacated by the injector pump was used to power a vacuum pump for the brake servo system. To reduce engine weight, extensive use of aluminium castings was made for the cambelt case, vacuum pump, rocker cover and other parts. Other small improvements were made such as the fitment of a spin-on cartridge oil filter instead of older, harder-to-change element type and the fitting of under-piston oil jets. In the mid-1980s Land Rover was part of the Land Rover Group, responsible for production of the Freight Rover van. The 2.5-litre diesel was fitted to the Freight Rover 300-series and the FX4 taxi (the engines for these applications had slight design changes, such as higher-mounted injector pumps and non-waterproof cambelt cases. They received the designations 14J and 15J respectively. Being fitted with a timing belt rather than a chain the 15J engine suffered none of the reliability problems in the FX4 that its 10J predecessor had encountered (see above)). The engine became a special-order only option after the introduction of <b>turbodiesel</b> engines (see below) but remained in production (and popular with military and some commercial buyers) until 1994. The British Army used this engine {{in the vast majority of}} the 20,000 Land Rovers it bought between 1985 and 1994. A manufacturing flaw with pistons combined with Army maintenance practises (such as a tendency to over-fill the sump with oil) caused the engines to over-breathe and ingest their oil, leading to piston failure. Late military-spec engines had a centrifugal separator in the breather system, allowing excess oil to drain back to the sump. These engines were designated 13J. and 11J (ref Land Rover Defender Military 110 1991 Supplementary Parts Catalogue). These later, modified engines were the first in their class (small capacity high-speed diesels) to pass the Ministry of Defence's arduous 500-hour durability trial.|$|E

50|$|L. Gardner and Sons ceased {{production}} of new engines {{in the early}} 1990s. The introduction of emissions regulations for road-going Gardner diesels would have required the development of significantly modified or totally new engine designs, and in the marine market there was a shift away from big, low-speed, high-torque engines such as Gardners towards adapted high-speed automotive <b>turbodiesels.</b>|$|R
