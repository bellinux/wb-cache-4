Our work concentrated on hybrid photovoltaic cells {{that are based on}} organic (polythiophene) and inorganic components (ZnO nanorods). The technology that maximizes the contact area between the two semi-conductor n and p while maintaining two separate components is the interdigital configuration. As the inorganic part, perfectly well aligned zinc oxide (ZnO) 1 D nanostructures have been synthesized by hydrothermal growth on ZnO-seeded FTO substrates. SEM, AFM and XRD characterizations evidence patterned well- aligned nanorods with high c-axis, their roughness of surface and the length of their nanostructure. Concerning the organic component, we synthetize polythiophenes based diblock copolymer with high degree of regioregularity and predetermined molecular weight using Grignard Methatis (GRIM) process. Diblock polythiophene based copolymers are of interest because of the possibility of generating multifunctional materials (by associating the specific properties of each block), including their ability for self-assembly into well-defined nanostructures (fibrils or micelles) with controllable dimensions. Poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) composes the first block and the second block is either a polythiophene bearing an acrylate group on each monomer unit (PAcET), or a polythiophene bearing both acrylate and poly(ethylene glycol) side chains (P(AcET-co-PEGET)).

The evolution of the superposition state {{is characterized by the}} populations of the constituent states as well as their coherence. The latter we extract employing a novel scheme analogous to the spin-echo technique. Comparing the results directly to measurements on freely-evolving fermions allows us to isolate the decoherence effects induced by the bath. In our system, the decoherence time is close to the maximal possible value since the decoherence is dominated by population relaxation processes.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a sampling and remote estimation problem, where samples of a Wiener process are forwarded {{to a remote}} estimator via a channel with queueing and random delay. The estimator reconstructs {{an estimate of the}} real-time signal value from causally received samples. We obtain the jointly optimal sampling and estimation strategy that minimizes the mean-square estimation error subject to a maximum sampling rate constraint. We prove that a threshold-based sampler and a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimator are jointly optimal, and the optimal threshold is found exactly. Our jointly optimal solution exhibits an interesting coupling between the source and channel, which is different from the source-channel separation in many previous information theoretical studies. If the sampling times are independent of the observed Wiener process, the joint sampling and estimation optimization problem reduces to an age-of-information optimization problem that has been recently solved. Our theoretical and numerical comparisons show that the estimation error of the optimal sampling policy can be much smaller than those of age-optimal sampling, zero-wait sampling, and classic periodic sampling.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel real-time algorithm for facial landmark tracking. Compared to detection, tracking has both additional challenges and opportunities. Arguably {{the most important}} aspect in this domain is updating a tracker's models as tracking progresses, also known as incremental (face) tracking. While this should result in more accurate localisation, how to do this online and in real time without causing a tracker to drift is still an important open research question. We address this question in the cascaded regression framework, the state-of-the-art approach for facial landmark localisation. Because incremental learning for cascaded regression is costly, we propose a much more efficient yet equally accurate alternative using continuous regression. More specifically, we first propose cascaded continuous regression (CCR) and show its accuracy is equivalent to the Supervised Descent Method. We then derive the incremental learning updates for CCR (iCCR) and show that it is an order of magnitude faster than standard incremental learning for cascaded regression, bringing the time required for the update from seconds down to a fraction of a second, thus enabling real-time tracking. Finally, we evaluate iCCR and show the importance of incremental learning in achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code for our iCCR is available from [URL] ECCV 2016 accepted paper, with supplementary material included as appendices. References <b>to</b> Equations <b>fixe...</b>|$|R

This trivial extension to the MSSM may account for the atomospheric neutrino data via ν_μ→ν_τ oscillations by assuming a near maximal mixing angle θ_ 23 ∼π/ 4 and taking Δ m_ 23 ^ 2 ∼ m_ν_ 3 ^ 2 ∼ 2. 5 × 10 ^- 3 eV^ 2.

The effect of the shaft speed on the critical pressure drop is investigated {{in relation to the}} volume of the magneto-fluid plug, the magnetic field strength, the magnetic properties of the fluid, the gap width, and the shaft radius. The flow pattern and the thermal power released in the sealing layer are studied. This paper continues a series of publications [1 – 8] dedicated to the numerical simulation of a single-stage annular magneto-fluid seal. We will study the behavior of a magneto-fluid plug in the narrow profiled gap between two coaxial surfaces of revolution, the inner of which rotates. To the outer fixed cylindrical surface, an annular axially magnetized permanent magnet with a hyperboloidal polar head (magnetic flux concentrator) is attached. A magnetic fluid between the shaft and the polar head forms a hermetic barrier which isolates regions at different pressures. The plug is retained in the gap by the high-gradient magnetic field of the concentrator directed across the gap, which opposes the centrifugal force and the pressure drop that try to push it out. The stability limits of the magneto-fluid plug are in large measure determined by the deformation of the disconnected free surface which consists of two asymmetric fragments with no point of contact.

First, its large saving (trade) surplus {{results in a}} currency mismatch {{because it is an}} immature creditor that cannot lend in its own currency. Instead, foreign currency claims (largely US dollars) build up within domestic financial institutions. Second, economists, both American and Chinese, mistakenly attribute the surpluses to an undervalued RMB. To placate the USA, the result was a gradual and predictable appreciation of the RMB against the dollar of 6 percent or more per year from July 2005 to July 2008. Together with the fall in US interest rates since mid- 2007, this one-way bet in the foreign exchanges markets not only attracted hot money inflows but inhibited private capital outflows from financing China’s huge trade surplus. Therefore, the People’s Bank of China had to intervene heavily to prevent the RMB from ratcheting upwards, and so became the country’s sole international financial intermediary as official exchange reserves exploded. Because of the currency mismatch, floating the RMB is neither feasible nor desirable, and a higher RMB would not reduce China’s trade surplus.

The Fmr 1 -KO mouse, lacks the fragile X mental {{retardation}} protein (FMRP), and is used as a model of the syndrome. The core behavioral deficits of autism may be conceptualized either as excessive adherence to patterns as seen in repetitive actions and aberrant language, or as insensitivity to subtle but socially important changes in patterns.

To gain more insight into the physiological function of FMRP and the neuronal mechanisms underlying fragile X syndrome, we examined the electrophysiological response of the hippocampus to pair pulse stimulation as a measure of patterned information processing and how it is affected in the Fmr 1 -KO mouse. Methods: In this study, we used paired-pulse stimulation of the afferent perforant path and recorded from the CA 1 region of the hippocampus. Two-month-old FVB/NJ male mice and age-matched Fmr 1 -KO mice were used in this study.

40|$|The HIDEEP survey (Minchin et al. 2003) {{was done}} {{in an attempt to}} find objects having low {{inferred}} neutral hydrogen column densities, yet they found a distribution which was strongly peaked at 10 ^ 20. 65 cm^- 2. In an attempt to understand this distribution and similar survey results, we model HI profiles of gas discs and use simple simulations of objects having a wide range of HI properties in the presence of an ionizing background. We find that inferred column density (N_HI^o) values, which are found by averaging total HI masses over some disc area, do not vary strongly with central column density (N_max) for detectable objects, so that even a population having a wide range of N_max values will give rise to a strongly peaked distribution of N_HI^o values. We find that populations of objects, having a wide range of model parameters, give rise to inferred column density distributions around 10 ^ 20. 6 +/- 0. 3 cm^- 2. However, populations of fairly massive objects having a wide range of central column densities work best in reproducing the HIDEEP data, and these populations are also consistent with observed Lyman limit absorber counts. It may be necessary to look two orders of magnitude fainter than HIDEEP limits to detect ionized objects having central column densities < 10 ^ 20 cm^- 2, but the inferred column densities of already detected objects might be lower if their radii could be estimated more accurately.

They are variations of directional (DIR), geographic distance (GEDIR) or progress-based (MFR) routing methods. In DIR methods each node A (the source or intermediate node) transmits a message m to several neighbors whose direction is closest to the direction of D. In MFR (most forward progress within radius), and GEDIR (GEographic DIstance Routing) methods, when node A wants to send m to node D, it forwards m neighbor C whose protection or distance (respectively) is closest to D among all neighbors of A.
