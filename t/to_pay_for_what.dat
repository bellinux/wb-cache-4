5|$|Hours after Isabel made landfall, President George W. Bush {{issued a}} major {{disaster}} declaration for 26 North Carolina counties, which allowed {{the use of}} federal personnel, equipment and lifesaving systems and the delivery of heavy-duty generators, plastic sheeting, tents, cots, food, water, medical aid and other essential supplies and materials for sustaining human life. The declaration also allocated federal funds for the long-term recovery of hurricane-stricken residents and business owners, {{as well as providing}} federal funds for the state and local governments to pay 75 percent of the eligible cost for debris removal and emergency services related to the hurricane, including requested emergency work undertaken by the federal government. By four days after the emergency declaration, assistance checks were mailed and used by residents <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> was not covered by their insurance.|$|E
25|$|At some point, McCroskey used {{a digital}} camera to record a video of himself, {{according}} to Ennis. In the video, he indicated that {{he knew he had}} <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> he had done and contemplated suicide, Ennis said.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The New York Times, he explained that [...] "I don't believe in redistribution of wealth {{for the sake of}} redistributing wealth. But I am concerned about how we can afford <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> we as a nation need to do [...] for what we need in order to be safe and productive. As Oliver Wendell Holmes once wrote, 'taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, at {{approximately}} 4:15–4:20 pm, {{a group of}} people approached the Pay-Less Liquor and Deli on Florence Avenue just west of Normandie. A gang member in an interview explains that the group [...] "just decided they weren’t going <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> they were getting." [...] The store owner's son was hit with a bottle of beer, and two other youths smashed the glass front door of the store. Two officers from the 77th Street Division of the LAPD responded to this incident and, finding that the instigators had already left, completed a report.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Fox {{was accused}} of {{illegally}} enriching himself after photos of Fox and his wife surfaced in the popular Mexican magazine Quien. The photos appeared to show Fox's ranch as newly renovated. Soon after, columnists and radio hosts began to question how Fox was able <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> appeared to be extensive renovations on his house. Fox denounced the allegations {{as part of a}} smear campaign against him. He also claimed that he purchased his ranch in 1999, before he was elected president of Mexico. In 2012, the Procuraduría General de la República reopened the investigation, but there has since been no update as to the status of the investigation.|$|E
2500|$|Summer and Ed join in {{with the}} {{argument}} {{and there is a}} lot of shouting. Lucas explained [...] "Summer's aware they've overloaded the car, so she wants to keep calm. She can sense Chris is getting stressed by all the yelling, so she's very tense." [...] As Chris tries to concentrate on the road, Andrew accidentally bumps his arm and he suddenly loses control of the car, which swerves, hits an embankment and flips over before coming to a stop. Sophie is critically injured after being thrown from the vehicle, while Andrew has a serious head injury and Ed is also in a bad way. Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber) comes across the scene and puts his own life at risk to start [...] "frantic" [...] rescue efforts. He cuts his hand in the process, but refuses to get it looked when the emergency services arrive. Rhys eventually finds Sophie and when she reaches the hospital, she is rushed into surgery. A writer for Soap World commented that [...] "a terrified" [...] Natasha is worried Ed will not wake up, before she can tell him she loves him. Mason stated that Chris is wracked with guilt and worried for his friends. Things become worse for him when Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) arrives at the hospital and, after learning his son and niece are in a serious condition, threatens to sue him. Mason revealed that Paul is angry and wants someone <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> happened, while Dennis explained [...] "Yes, it's typical Paul - someone has to pay and he decides that Chris should take all of the blame before he knows the full story." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Hope they'll like it," [...] his {{neighbour}} remarked, sardonically. [...] "Plenty {{of glory}} {{and a good}} price <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> it. <b>What</b> licks me is that every one seems to imagine that this Tariff Bill {{is going to give}} the working-classes a leg-up.

5000|$|... vCloud Hybrid Service was rebranded to vCloud Air on August 21, 2014. vCloud Air {{provides}} a hybrid cloud—a public IaaS that functions {{as an extension}} of existing data centers running VMware vSphere, with common management and networking.

50|$|With a look {{considered}} modern for its time, {{the building}} consisted of nine stories of office space, a rooftop garden including a 600-seat venue for outdoor performances, and a four-story observation tower, the distinctive feature which also gave the building its name. Electricity and gas lighting {{was provided to}} all tenants. Access to the tower was provided <b>to</b> <b>paying</b> customers <b>for</b> <b>what</b> {{was at the time}} an almost unique view of the city. The installation of a beacon that would shine over the city nightly added further to the buildings uniqueness.|$|R

5000|$|Justice Douglas, {{with whom}} Justices Black, Vinson, and Reed concurred, dissented from the {{majority}} decision, and asserted that the majority decision forced the United States <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> not <b>for</b> <b>what</b> it gets, but <b>for</b> <b>what</b> the owner loses. Warning that the majority decision [...] "forged new constitutional doctrine," [...] the dissent argued that government was only required <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> just compensation <b>for</b> the property that it actually receives. That the trade routes were of no use to the government was particularly persuasive to the dissenting Justices, and they argued that if the business was destroyed, the destruction was an unintended incident of the taking of land, and thus not compensable.|$|R
50|$|Gwydion, Fflewddur, and Gurgi {{have entered}} the halls as well, {{and they have the}} better of a {{struggle}} with Magg and some guards, but the appearance of Achren and Eilonwy everything.

Achren turns to Taran and offers <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> him <b>for</b> <b>what</b> he knows: she will restore Eilonwy's memories of him and allow them to wed. Gwydion interrupts the torment by revealing the cache and Magg retrieves the magical implements.|$|R

60|$|That night Toby took supper {{with the}} {{skeleton}} and his wife, and {{he enjoyed the}} meal, {{even though it was}} made from what had been left of the turkey that served as the noonday feast, more than he did the state dinner, where he was obliged <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> he ate by the torture of making a speech.|$|E

40|$|More {{and more}} Americans {{are looking for}} {{opportunities}} to exert some measure of control over where and how they die. In this program, veteran PBS journalist Bill Moyers unravels the complexities underlying the many choices {{at the end of}} life, including the bitter debate over physician-assisted suicide.
