5|$|Phips {{arrived back}} in Boston {{in the summer}} of 1688 and was welcomed back as a hero. His wife seemed very happy to see him. He was celebrated in sermons and at the Harvard college {{commencement}} he was compared to Jason fetching the Golden Fleece. Andros and Randolph were not so happy to see him and it seems <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>was</b> mutual. Almost all of New England was unified in their opposition to Andros and Randolph. It is interesting to note here that Phips, despite having been captain of Randolph's gunship in '83-4, {{does not seem to have}} carried an association with Randolph in the minds of the people of Massachusetts Bay.|$|E
25|$|Away from Hollywood and {{the culture}} of celebrity, Monroe's life became more normal; she began cooking, keeping house and giving Miller more {{attention}} and affection than he had been used to. His children, aged twelve and nine, adored her and were reluctant to return to their mother when the weekend was over. As she was also fond of older people, she got along well with his parents, and <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>was</b> mutual.|$|E
500|$|Early on, Billy Cox {{believed}} that the primary goal was to resolve the matter with Chalpin. Later, he commented, [...] "Overall, <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>was,</b> 'What the heck, the album doesn't belong to us anyway. [...] Let's just move on and forget it'". [...] Already past the 1969 deadline, Hendrix summed it up: ...|$|E
5000|$|Yolanda, {{the object}} of Jamaal's fawning affection. <b>The</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> only {{somewhat}} reciprocated.|$|R
50|$|Jemima- A snobbish girl on whom Preston has a crush. <b>The</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> not returned.|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps another helpful {{analogy to}} Berry's Paradox {{would be the}} phrase, [...] "indescribable feeling". [...] If <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> indeed indescribable, then no {{description}} of <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> would <b>be</b> true. But if the word [...] "indescribable" [...] communicates something about <b>the</b> <b>feeling,</b> then it may be considered a description: this is self-contradictory.|$|R
500|$|David Hayter, Stan Lee, and Tom DeSanto make cameo appearances. George Buza, {{the voice}} of Beast in , {{appeared}} as the truck driver who drops Rogue off at the bar at which Wolverine fights. Other cameo appearances include Sumela Kay as Kitty Pryde, Katrina Florece as Jubilee, Donald MacKinnon as a young Colossus sketching a picture in one scene, and Alexander Burton as Pyro. Gambit was considered {{for one of the}} students at the X-Mansion. Singer remembered, [...] "We thought about Gambit as the young boy on the basketball field, but <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>was</b> that if he has the basketball and then releases it and it exploded, [...] people would be like 'What's wrong with those basketballs?'" [...] Kevin Feige had a cameo as a Weapon X tech, but his scenes did not make the final cut of the film.|$|E
500|$|Newspaper reports {{throughout}} the period combined real evidence, unsubstantiated rumors, and journalistic speculation. Dinnerstein wrote, [...] "Characterized by innuendo, misrepresentation, and distortion, the yellow journalism account of Mary Phagan's death aroused an anxious city, {{and within a}} few days, a shocked state." [...] Different segments of the population focused on different aspects. Atlanta's working class saw Frank as [...] "a defiler of young girls", while the German-Jewish community saw him as [...] "an exemplary man and loyal husband." [...] Albert Lindemann, author of The Jew Accused, opined that [...] "ordinary people" [...] may have had difficulty evaluating the often unreliable information and in [...] "suspend judgment {{over a long period of}} time" [...] while the case developed. As the press shaped public opinion, much of the public's attention was directed at the police and the prosecution, whom they expected to bring Phagan's killer to justice. The prosecutor, Hugh Dorsey, had recently lost two high-profile murder cases; one state newspaper wrote that [...] "another defeat, and in a case where <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>was</b> so intense, would have been, in all likelihood, the end of Mr. Dorsey, as solicitor." ...|$|E
500|$|Ripken {{was drafted}} by the Baltimore Orioles {{in the second round}} of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft 48th overall. Despite a story written by SABR, Ripken was {{selected}} with the Orioles' predetermined draft pick, not through a forfeited pick from the Boston Red Sox after the Sox selected Dick Drago in the 1977 re-entry draft. The Orioles would select catcher Cecil Whitehead with the pick they received from Boston two picks after Ripken. On deciding to go straight from high school to the professional level, he said, [...] "When the colleges started coming around, Dad and I talked about mostly whether I was going to pursue a career in baseball. If I had the ability, <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>was</b> to get on with it, and if it didn't work out, start over again in college at 25 or 26." [...] Ripken played both pitcher and shortstop in high school; in fact, the Orioles were the only team not just interested in his pitching ability. The Orioles decided to start him playing shortstop in the minor leagues, deciding it would be easier for him to transition back to pitching if necessary than it would be for him to start hitting again.|$|E

500|$|The Nobel Laureate Hans Bethe speculated: [...] "I have {{sometimes}} wondered whether a brain like von Neumann's {{does not indicate}} a species superior to that of man". Eugene Wigner wrote that, seeing von Neumann's mind at work, [...] "one had {{the impression of a}} perfect instrument whose gears were machined to mesh accurately to a thousandth of an inch." [...] Paul Halmos states that [...] "von Neumann's speed was awe-inspiring." [...] Israel Halperin said: [...] "Keeping up with him was... impossible. <b>The</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>was</b> you were on a tricycle chasing a racing car." [...] Edward Teller admitted that he [...] "never could keep up with him". Teller also said [...] "von Neumann would carry on a conversation with my 3-year-old son, {{and the two of them}} would talk as equals, and I sometimes wondered if he used the same principle when he talked to the rest of us." [...] When George Dantzig brought von Neumann an unsolved problem in linear programming [...] "as I would to an ordinary mortal", on which there had been no published literature, he was astonished when von Neumann said [...] "Oh, that!", before offhandedly giving a lecture of over an hour, explaining how to solve the problem using the hitherto unconceived theory of duality.|$|E
500|$|Halfpenny {{revealed}} that Amy genuinely liked David and thought <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>was</b> mutual. [...] "She wouldn't {{do it to}} embarrass herself; {{i think that is}} one of Amy's biggest fears being embarrassed." [...] When David tracks Amy down; she blackmails him in return for the truth but David exposes her to Eric. Halfpenny said Amy was hurt by David's deception because she trusted him and despite their problems had a [...] "good relationship". Eric tries to convince Amy to return home to lead the life she had always wanted, because [...] "deep down he really cares about her." [...] The strict parenting role is played once again with Eric, and Halfpenny branded the moment as Amy [...] "meeting her match." [...] As [...] "nothing is straight forward with Amy", she returns home but finds telling the truth hard. Amy settles into village life until Jared Haynes (Philip Hill-Pearson) arrives and blackmails Amy. An Emmerdale spokesperson {{revealed that}} Amy had an affair with Jared's father and ruined his family. [...] "She’s got herself in a mess and this is just the start of her problems." [...] Amy steals from Val and Eric to pay Jared off. At this point in the story Val and Eric [...] "are sick of Amy's bad behaviour." [...] Val refuses to give her any more help.|$|E
2500|$|Anglos {{often viewed}} the Mexicans as foreigners and intruders. <b>The</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>was</b> often returned; Rafael Antonio Manchola, {{son-in-law}} of empresario Martín De León, {{served as the}} commander of the presidio at La Bahia from 1828 to 1830 and then as the alcalde of Goliad. He warned the military commander for Texas that ...|$|E

2500|$|Their {{marriage}} {{would prove to}} be an unhappy one; though Franz Joseph was passionately in love with his wife, [...] <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>was</b> not mutual and Sisi never truly acclimatised to life at court, frequently having disagreements with the imperial family. Their first daughter Sophie died as an infant, and their only son Rudolf died by suicide in 1889 in the infamous Mayerling Incident.|$|E
2500|$|Symonds' daughter, Madge Vaughan, was {{probably}} writer Virginia Woolf's first same-sex crush, {{though there is}} no evidence that <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>was</b> mutual. Woolf was the cousin of her husband William Wyamar Vaughan. Another daughter, Charlotte Symonds, married the classicist Walter Leaf. Henry James used some details of Symonds' life, especially the relationship between him and his wife, as the starting-point for the short story [...] "The Author of Beltraffio" [...] (1884).|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{pain was}} unbelievable, it snapped like a breadstick. It sounded like two muzzled gunshots off my left shoulder. Pow, pow!" [...] Theismann {{said during a}} 2005 interview. [...] "It was at that point, I also found out what a {{magnificent}} machine the human body is. Almost immediately, from the knee down, all <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>was</b> gone in my right leg. The endorphins had kicked in, and I was not in pain." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "One {{effect of}} outside resentment upon Winfield itself was to solidify {{sentiment}} among the inhabitants against their neighbors. [...] If their neighbors didn't like Winfield, <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>was</b> definitely mutual. [...] Another effect {{was to make}} the early Winfield settlers suspicious of all bureaucracy, including their own elected officers. [...] In this respect, the trying experiences and disillusionment attending the early days of Winfield have made its citizens even more sensitive than usual to rumors respecting changes in the community structures." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} {{is an example of}} this type of experience: ‘My husband died in June 1945, and 26 years afterwards when I was at Church, I felt him standing beside me during the singing of a hymn. I felt I would see him if I turned my head. <b>The</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>was</b> so strong I was reduced to tears. I had not been thinking of him before I felt his presence. I had not had this feeling before that day, neither has it happened since then.’ ...|$|E

2500|$|The McLain {{trade was}} {{made over the}} strenuous {{objections}} of Senators manager Ted Williams, who had little patience for McLain's high living. [...] <b>The</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>was</b> mutual; early in the 1971 season, he became a charter member of the [...] "Underminers' Club", a group of five players dedicated to getting Williams fired. They {{spent much of the}} season feuding over Williams' use of a then-unusual five-man rotation for his starters. Senators broadcaster Shelby Whitfield later told Rob Neyer that when Williams yanked McLain early from a July 5 game against the Cleveland Indians, McLain threatened to call Senators owner Bob Short and have him get rid of Williams.|$|E
2500|$|In early 2007, it was {{announced}} the Queen had signed an exclusive contract to release Sentimiento. [...] "I’m super-proud {{to be a part}} of Univision Music Group. I’ve always felt like I was part of a family with them, because they handled my last album and they did an excellent job. They are a strong and important company who always respects its artists."

2500|$|After her death, several poems {{appeared}} in the Guatemalan press as a posthumous tribute, where the authors confess the admiration that she had awakened in them. José María Izaguirre, for example, proposed to strengthen the myth of death for love: [...] "When Martí returned with Carmen he {{did not return to}} the general's house, for <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>was</b> deeply rooted in María's soul, and she was of those that easily forget. Her passion was locked in this dilemma: be satisfied, or die. Unable to get the first, he had only the second option left.
