500|$|Endorsed by meat {{production}} company Oscar Mayer, [...] "Sisters at Heart" [...] is a half-hour, color episode that aired on December 24, 1970, as the 213th episode of Bewitched to be aired. As an introduction and conclusion to the episode, Montgomery briefly {{spoke to the}} camera about the episode, saying that it [...] "was created in the true spirit of Christmas ... conceived {{in the image of}} innocence and filled with truth." [...] ABC aired the episode only once more, in December 1971. Unlike many of the other episodes in the season, it was neither a remake of an episode from a previous season nor part of the Salem, Massachusetts, story arc that was filmed in the area where the 17th-century Salem witch trials took place. Don Marshall, who made a guest appearance in [...] "Sisters at Heart" [...] as Keith Wilson, was known for his role in Land of the Giants, while Janee Michelle, who portrayed Dorothy Wilson in [...] "Sisters at Heart", later became best known for her role in the 1974 horror film The House on Skull Mountain. [...] "Sisters at Heart" [...] was Montgomery's favorite episode of the series. Reflecting on the episode in 1989, she said, [...] "Yeah, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> Bewitched to be all about." [...] Sony Pictures Home Entertainment eventually released the episode on a VHS collection called A Bewitched Christmas 2. On June 16, 2005, the episode was screened in Salem as the first entry in [...] "The Art and Politics of Elizabeth Montgomery", a film-watching and discussion group that met at First Church in Salem.|$|E

2500|$|Bow Wow had {{publicly}} {{announced his}} interpretation of the song's meaning as he stated {{in an interview with}} MTV: [...] "Basically the song is me talking to a girl and telling her, 'These are the things I can do for you.

I'm just really talking to the ladies. The song is really special to me, and I love that song." [...] The collaboration began when Bow Wow was talking with producer Jermaine Dupri about the song and how he suggested on getting Omarion to appear on the track.|$|E

It was to be her final acting role and she was honored posthumously with a second Emmy Award for Best Actress. [...] Her daughter, Isabella, described Bergman's surprise at being offered the part and the producer {{trying to explain to}} her, [...] "People believe you and trust you, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want,</b> because Golda Meir had the trust of the people." [...] Isabella adds, [...] "Now that was interesting to Mother." [...] She was also persuaded that Golda was a [...] "grand-scale person," [...] one that people would assume was much taller than she actually was. Chandler notes that the role [...] "also had a special significance for her, as during World War II, Ingrid felt guilty because she had so misjudged the situation in Germany." ...|$|E

We always had the feeling that they were on our side. I don't know but I think we were right." [...] NME commented on Slade's legacy in a review of a greatest hits album, [...] "They embodied the glorious absurdity of the greatest pop, in the sideburns, the mirrored top hat and Dave Hill's pudding bowl haircut. As such they were the simplest, most effective possible, riposte to prog rock's bloated pretensions and pseudo-intellect." [...] In 1981, Adam and the Ants' lead guitarist and co-songwriter Marco Pirroni stated that he was greatly influenced by the first gig he ever attended which was Slade at Wembley Pool in 1973.|$|E

There is more money in the country than there has ever been, but there are just the same number of real and fancied diseases. Mankind is, if possible, more credulous to-day than at any epoch during our history. There are millions who will snatch at the slightest chance of getting rid of some real or fancied ailment.

Perhaps those who have faced it and come back again to tell of their {{experiences}} {{have been a little}} hysterical--the horror of it has carried them away. They may not have adopted the most effectual means of making the world understand, but it is there. I have seen it. A thousandth part of this misery in a country with which we had nothing to do, and no business to interfere, and we should be having mass meetings at Exeter Hall, and making general asses of ourselves all over the country, shrieking for intervention, wasting a whole dictionary of rhetoric, and probably getting well snubbed for our pains. And because the murders are by slow poison instead of with steel, because they are in our own cities and amongst our own people, we accept them with a sort of placid satisfaction. You, Lord Redford, speak of character and enunciate social laws, and Borrowdean will argue that after all the trade of the country is not so bad as it might be, and will make an epigram on the importation of sentimentality into politics. In plain words, Lord Redford, we, as a party, are asleep to what is going on. One statesman has recognized it, and proposed a startling and drastic remedy. We attack the remedy tooth and nail, but we place forward no counter proposition. It is as though a dying man were attended by two doctors, one of whom has prepared a remedy which the other declines to administer without suggesting one of his own. It is not a logical position. The medicine may not cure, but let the man have his chance of life." ...|$|E
6000|$|And yet the Scripture {{does most}} {{certainly}} {{speak of the}} Lord's coming out of His place to visit--of the Son of Man coming, and not coming to men--of His visiting us at one time and not at another. How does that agree with what I have just said? My dear friends, we shall see that it agrees perfectly with what I have said, if we will only just remember {{that we are not}} beasts, but men. It may seem a strange thing to have to remind people of, but it is just what they are always forgetting. My friends, we are not animals, we are not spiders to do nothing but spin, or birds only to build nests for ourselves, much less swine to do nothing but dig after roots and fruits, and get what we can out of the clods of the ground. We are the children of the Most High God; we have immortal souls within us; nay, more, we are our souls: our bodies are our husk--our shell--our clothes--our house--changing day by day, and year by year upon us, one day to drop off us till the Resurrection. But WE are our SOULS, and when God visits, it is our souls He visits, not merely our bodies. There is the whole secret. People forget God, and therefore they are glad to fancy that He has forgotten them, and {{has nothing to do with}} this world of His which they are misusing for their own selfish ends; and then God in His mercy visits them. He knocks at the door of their hearts, saying: [...] "See! I was close to you all the while." [...] He forces them to see Him and to confess that He is there whether they choose or not. God is not away from the world. He is away from people's hearts, because He has given people free wills, and with free wills the power of keeping Him out of their hearts or letting Him in. And when God visits He forces Himself on our attention. He knocks at the door of our hard hearts so loudly and sharply that He forces all to confess that He is there--all who are not utterly reprobate and spiritually dead. In blessings as well as in curses, God knocks at our hearts. By sudden good fortune, as well as by sudden mishap; by a great deliverance from enemies, by an abundant harvest, as well as by famine and pestilence. Therefore this cholera has been a true visitation of God. The poor had fancied that they might be as dirty, the rich had fancied that they might be as careless, as they chose; in short, that they might break God's laws of cleanliness and brotherly care without His troubling Himself about the matter. And lo! He has visited us; and shown us that He does care about the matter by taking it into His own hands with a vengeance. He who cannot see God's hand in the cholera must be as blind--as blind as who?--as blind as he that cannot see God's hand when there is no cholera; as blind as he who cannot see God's hand in every meal he eats, and every breath he draws; for that man is stone blind--he can be no blinder. The cholera came; everyone ought to see that it did not come by blind chance, but by the will of some wise and righteous Person; for in the first place God gave us fair warning. The cholera came from India at a steady pace. We knew to a month when it would arrive here. And it came, too, by no blind necessity, as if it was forced to take people whether it liked or not. Just as it was in the fever here, so it was in the cholera, [...] "One shall be taken and another left." [...] It took one of a street and left another; took one person in a family and left another: it took the rich man who fancied he was safe, as well as the poor man who did not care whether he was safe or not. The respectable man walking home to his comfortable house, passed by some untrapped drain, and then poisonous gas struck him and he died. The rich physician who had been curing others, could not save himself from the poison of the crowded graveyard which had been allowed to remain at the back of his house. By all sorts of strange and unfathomable judgments the cholera showed itself to be working, not by a blind necessity, but at the will of a thinking Person, of a living God, whose ways are not as our own ways, and His paths are in the great deep. And yet the cholera showed--and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to make you feel--that it was working at the will of the same God in whom we live and move and have our being, who sends the food we eat, the water in which we wash, the air we breathe, and who has ordained for all these things natural laws, according to which they work, and which He never breaks, nor allows us to break them. For every case of cholera could be traced to some breaking of these laws--foul air--foul food--foul water, or careless and dirty contact with infected persons; so that by this God showed that He and not chance ruled the world, and that he was indeed the living and willing God. He showed at the same time that He was the wise God of order and of law; and that gas and earth, wind and vapour, fulfil His word, without His having to break His laws, or visit us by moving, as people fancy, out of a Heaven where He was, down to an earth, where He was not.|$|E
