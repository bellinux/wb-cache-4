500|$|The Big 12 Championship Game {{is held by}} the Big 12 Conference each year. The {{championship}} game pits the Big 12 North Division champion against the South Division champion in a game held after the regular season has been completed. Despite losing {{the last two games}} of the regular season, Colorado retained {{the best record in the}} North Division of the Big 12 Conference. Prior to the game, Colorado head coach Gary Barnett said, [...] "I do not think anybody expects us <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> and beat Texas." [...] His team lost the game 70–3, the most lopsided score in any college football conference championship to date.|$|E

[...] Well, the Roseland is still standing". Compared to the reigning band of Fletcher Henderson, Basie's band lacked polish and presentation.|$|E

2500|$|After {{splitting}} {{his time}} in the 2013 season between the Fightin Phils and the Lehigh Valley Iron Pigs (Class AAA – International League), Buchanan attended a Prospect Education Program hosted by the Phillies organization in January 2014. At the time, {{he was the only one}} of the eight attendees who had not been invited to major league camp at spring training, however after taking a [...] "leadership role" [...] at the program, Joe Jordan (the Phillies' director of player development) and manager Ryne Sandberg tendered Buchanan an invitation to big league camp. He entered camp competing for a spot in the Phillies rotation, and impressed the Phillies' staff, ultimately becoming a finalist for the position with Jeff Manship. He did not make the opening day roster despite his strong performance, but would remain in consideration for promotion during the 2014 season, particularly as a spot starter or even the Phillies' fifth starter if needed due to injury. Buchanan commented, [...] "I wanted <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> and make an impression and open us some eyes and I feel like I did that. I feel like I proved myself that I am ready for the next level. I had a blast every day in camp." ...|$|E
