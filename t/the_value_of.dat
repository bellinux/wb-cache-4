5|$|Federal Reconstruction in Mobile {{began after}} the Civil War and {{effectively}} ended in 1874 {{when the local}} Democrats gained control of the city government.

One example can be provided by <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> Mobile's exports during this period of depression. <b>The</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> exports leaving the city fell from $9 million in 1878 to $3million in 1882.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have been}} trapped since the 18th century. They have been popular with trappers due to <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> their fur, {{which has been}} used for scarves and neck pieces.

They are easily trapped, and <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> their fur was a particular incentive for catching this species.|$|E

5|$|After {{winning the}} bidding, TETCO raised {{the money to}} pay the {{government}} through a combination of bonds and share issues. A further government enquiry was required before the sale was allowed to go through, which was complicated by the reluctance of the state of Pennsylvania to allow the pipelines to be used to pump gas east through its territory. The government of Pennsylvania was influenced by the coal industry, who feared they would lose sales, but it eventually relented and the sale of the pipelines to TETCO was finally completed on November 1. <b>The</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the company soared, and the original investors saw <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> their holdings increase 63-fold.|$|E

As the grid lines are {{parallel to the}} coordinate axes and <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> zare exactly known on the boundary, this implies that the successive tangential partial derivatives of z are known exactly on the boundary.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, agriculture, timber, and {{ranching}} were the leading economic engines of Texas. This was changed by the boom, which led to rapid industrialization. Though refineries were initially concentrated around the Beaumont and Houston areas, refining operations gradually grew throughout the state {{by the end of the}} 1920s. By 1940, <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> petroleum and natural gas produced in Texas exceeded <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> all agricultural products in the state. The state's GDP grew from approximately $119 million ($ in today's terms) in 1900 to approximately $29 billion ($ in today's terms), a more than 240-fold increase. The U.S. GDP as a whole grew by less than 24 times during the same period.|$|E
