5|$|The orchard {{contains}} {{fruit trees}} such as quinces, medlars, crab {{apples and pears}} are underplanted with spring-flowering meadow plants such as snakeshead fritillaries, camassias, narcissus, cowslips and lady's smock. The orchard is crossed by wide mown paths meeting at a central sundial. Originally four weeping elms were situated at {{the four corners of}} the garden, but they succumbed to Dutch elm disease in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>seventies</b> and were replaced in 1973 by four weeping ash trees which make inviting 'houses'. The orchard can be viewed from the raised walk on its east side, another idea copied from Avebury Manor. A main path known as the Long walk is based on the Long Walk at Hidcote Manor Garden in Gloucestershire, although it is on a smaller scale. It is a plain grassed walkway connecting the Raised Walk with the Pond Garden.|$|E

25|$|Despite postwar affluence, however, many Belgians {{continued}} to live in poverty. An organisation of several poverty action groups, known as the National Action for Security of Subsistence, claimed that more than 900,000 Belgians (about 10% of the population) lived in poverty in 1967, while in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>Seventies,</b> a group of social scientists called the Working Group on Alternative Economics estimated that about 14.5% of the Belgian population lived in poverty.|$|E
25|$|Yoweri Museveni, {{president}} of Uganda, lived in Dar es Salaam for many years, {{first as a}} student and later as a political refugee.

25|$|The modern {{mounting}} system arose in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>seventies,</b> when touring ballets {{came into contact}} with synthetic rope used by the military. Initially, the synthetic rope was used to replace the twisted cowhide strips. However, the rope could now be tightened {{to the point where it}} tore through the skin; in response, drum makers started using steel rings instead of twisted cowhide to hold the skin in place. Despite objections from many djembefolas, the modern {{mounting system}} gradually displaced the traditional one and, by 1991 had completely replaced it.|$|E

25|$|With six-foot four-inch {{players such}} as England {{international}} back row David Gay, Peter Heindorff, Sibley had players with physique to impose this style of play. With the mercurial John Horton and the incisive Mike Beese, the side continued to develop Bath's reputation in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>Seventies</b> with wins over the top Welsh sides. However, the revolution began {{with the arrival of}} coach Jack Rowell in 1978. Rowell transformed the ethos of a club that had traditionally drawn its players from the immediate locality. When formalised competitions started in the 1980s Jack Rowell brought premature professionalism to Bath and began to assemble a side with power and precision. The power, provided by Gareth Chilcott and Roger Spurrell was complemented by the precision of John Horton and winger David Trick.|$|E
25|$|In {{the recent}} decade's general elections, {{political}} commentators positioned D66 at {{the centre of}} the political spectrum and that most inclined to progressive reform. This offers the party a lot of possibilities for co-operation with others in the Dutch political landscape. Historically, D66 has co-operated in cabinets with the Labour Party (PvdA). They were in four cabinets together (Den Uyl, Van Agt II, Kok I and Kok II); and they formed a shadow cabinet during <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>seventies.</b> The relations with the PvdA came under heavy tension three times: in 1981 when D66 decided to continue to govern with the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), after the PvdA ministers had left the first Van Agt cabinet; in 1989 when PvdA formed a third Lubbers cabinet without D66; and 2003 when D66 joined the second Balkenende cabinet.|$|E
25|$|Ernő Zórád {{ended his}} {{professional}} relationship with Tibor Cs. Horváth and wrote his own comic scripts. Luckily Zórád {{was not just}} a great artist, but also a talented storyteller: these comics came much closer to the medium's own language. He also made experimental collage comics in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>seventies</b> attracting international attention. These works were invited to the Salone Internazionale del Comics festival in 1970 but his portfolio – due to Hungarian bureaucracy – has arrived late. Furthermore, the works has been stolen from the festival. By the late seventies the classic trio of Hungarian comics creators disappeared: Korcsmáros died in 1975, Sebők died in 1980 and Zórád retired temporarily. Since young talents were not introduced during the preceding three decades (except for Attila Fazekas), many mark these years the end of Hungarian comics' golden age.|$|E
50|$|In 1950, the UK {{standard}} of living was higher than in any EEC country apart from Belgium. It was 50% higher than the West German {{standard of}} living, and {{twice as high as}} the Italian {{standard of living}}. By <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>Seventies,</b> however, <b>the</b> UK standard of living was lower than all EEC countries apart from Italy (which, according to one calculation, was roughly equal to Britain). In 1951, the average weekly earnings of men over the age of 21 stood at £8 6s 0d, and nearly doubled a decade later to £15 7s 0d. By 1966, average weekly earnings stood at £20 6s 0d. Between 1964 and 1968, the percentage of households with a television set rose from 80.5% to 85.5%, a washing machine from 54% to 63%, a refrigerator from 35% to 55%, a car from 38% to 49%, a telephone from 21.5% to 28%, and central heating from 13% to 23%.|$|R

50|$|Apart {{from its}} main publication, Het Parool {{published}} magazines and local {{newspapers in the}} Netherlands. A string of locally-based newspapers appeared alongside Het Parool, including Het Rotterdamsch Parool (1947-1971), Nieuw Utrechtsch Dagblad, Haagsch Dagblad, and Het Flevoparool (1982-1988).

25|$|Folk {{religions}} and animists {{with a deep}} concern {{for the preservation of}} their traditional ancestor religions declared their religion to be Hinduism, considering it a more flexible option than Islam, in the outer islands. In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>seventies,</b> the Toraja people of Sulawesi were the first to realize this opportunity by seeking shelter for their indigenous ancestor religion under the broad umbrella of 'Hinduism', followed by the Karo Batak of Sumatra in 1977. In central and southern Kalimantan, a large Hindu movement has grown among the local indigenous Dayak population which lead to a mass declaration of 'Hinduism' on this island in 1980. However, this was different from the Javanese case, in that conversions followed a clear ethnic division. Indigenous Dayak were confronted with a mostly Muslim population of government-sponsored (and predominantly Madurese) migrants and officials, and deeply resentful at the dispossession of their land and its natural resources.|$|E
25|$|From within Naples' Poggioreale prison Cutolo {{built a new}} organisation: the Nuova Camorra Organizzata (NCO). He {{began by}} befriending young inmates {{unfamiliar}} with jail, giving {{them a sense of}} identity and worth, so much so that when they were released they would send Cutolo ‘flowers’ (i.e. money), which enabled him to increase his network. He helped poorer prisoners by buying food for them from the jail store, or arranging for food to be sent in from outside. In such ways Cutolo created many ‘debts’ or ‘rain cheques’ which he would cash at the opportune moment. As his following grew, he also began to exercise a monopoly of violence within a number of prisons, thus increasing his power. By <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>seventies,</b> Cutolo had become so powerful {{that he was able to}} decide which of his followers would be moved to which jails, use a prison governor's telephone to make calls anywhere in the world, and allegedly even slap the prison governor on one occasion for daring to search his cell. Another key bond Cutolo created was regular payments to the families of NCO members sent to prison, thereby guaranteeing the allegiance of both prisoners and their families.|$|E
