Despite the lack of specificity, the term remains in use {{in the literature of}} chemistry.|$|E
5|$|According to Yager Development, 2K never {{discussed}} {{the chance of}} developing a sequel during the game's development. Timo Ullman, managing director of Yager stated that the game failed to compete with other shooters, and that market for games like Spec Ops: The Line is too small. As a result, the team would {{not return to the}} franchise. Team members expressed a desire to move on and develop a game <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> much lighter tone.|$|E

5|$|The Roksan Xerxes {{transcription}} turntable (often shortened to Xerxes) is {{a record}} player named after the Persian king Xerxes I and produced by London-based Roksan Audio. Designed by Roksan co-founder, Touraj Moghaddam, the Xerxes is a belt-driven turntable <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> solid plinth. Launched in 1985, the sound quality of the product positioned it as a strong competitor against the established industry leader, the Linn Sondek LP12. Many reviewers use the Xerxes as a reference turntable.|$|E
5|$|The {{compound}} polyozellin—a chemical {{which can}} be isolated and purified from P.multiplex—inhibits prolyl endopeptidase (PEP), an enzyme <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> role in processing proteins (specifically, amyloid precursor protein) in Alzheimer's disease. Chemicals that inhibit PEP have attracted research interest due to their potential therapeutic effects. Further analyses of extracts from P.multiplex revealed similar dibenzofuranyl derivatives of polyozellin, each with different chemical properties, including kynapcin-12, kynapcin-13 and -28, and -24. A total synthesis of kynapcin-24 was achieved in 2009.|$|E
