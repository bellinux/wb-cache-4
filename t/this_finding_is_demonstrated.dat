40|$|International audienceOur {{laboratory}} {{has previously}} shown that apelin is mitogenic for endothelial cells. We have postulated that apelin represents an angiogenic factor secreted by tumour cells {{in order to}} promote the formation of new vessels necessary for tumour growth. We first demonstrate that apelin and its receptor are not expressed by the mouse TS/A mammary carcinoma cells. We therefore established clones of this tumoral cell type stably overexpressing the apelin cDNA (TS/A-apelin clones). Comparison of the in vitro proliferation rates between TS/A-mock and TS/A-apelin cells did not reveal any difference and confirmed the lack of receptor expression by tumour cells. On the other hand, apelin overexpression clearly increased the in vivo tumour growth and this increase was associated with an earlier onset of tumour development. In tumours derived from TS/A-apelin clones, the expression of the endothelial marker CD 31 was increased and revealed the formation of large intratumoral vessels lined with CD 31 positive cells. These data suggest that apelin behaves as a potent activator of tumour neoangiogenesis by a paracrine effect on host vessels. The pathological relevance of <b>this</b> <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by hypoxia-induced upregulation of apelin gene and its overexpression in one-third of human tumours...|$|E

40|$|New {{acquisition}} {{methods have}} increased the availability of surface prop-erty data that capture location-dependent data on feature surfaces. However, these data are not supported as fully in the geovisualization of the Digital City as established data categories such as feature attributes, 2 D rasters, or geometry. Consequently, 3 D surface properties are largely excluded from the information extraction and knowledge creation process of geovisualization despite their potential for being an effective tool in many such tasks. To overcome this situation, this paper examines {{the benefits of a}} better inte-gration into geovisualization systems in terms of two examples and discusses technological foundations for surface property support.

40|$|Volatile {{exchange}} rates {{and how to}} manage them are a contentious topic whenever economic policymakers gather in international meetings. This book examines the broad parameters of exchange rate policy in light of both high-powered theory and real-world experience. What are {{the costs and benefits}} of flexible versus fixed {{exchange rates}}? How much of a role should the exchange rate play in monetary policy? Why don't volatile exchange rates destabilize inflation and output? The principal finding of this book is that using monetary policy to fight exchange rate volatility, including through the adoption of a fixed exchange rate regime, leads to greater volatility of employment, output, and inflation. In other words, the "cure" for exchange rate volatility is worse than the disease. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> in economic models, in historical case studies, and in statistical analysis of the data. The book devotes considerable attention to understanding the reasons why volatile exchange rates do not destabilize inflation and output. The book concludes that many countries would benefit from allowing greater flexibility of their exchange rates in order to target monetary policy at stabilization of their domestic economies. Few, if any, countries would benefit from a move in the opposite direction. ...|$|E
40|$|The Ski {{oncogene}} has dramatic {{effects on}} the differentiation of several different cell types. It induces the differentiation of quail embryo cells into myoblasts and arrests the differentiation of chicken hematopoietic cells. The mechanism that Ski uses to carry out these disparate biological activities is unknown. However, we were struck by the similarity of these effects to those of certain members of the nuclear hormone receptor family. Both Ski and the thyroid hormone receptor-derived oncogene v-ErbA can arrest the differentiation of avian erythroblasts, and v-Ski-transformed avian multipotent progenitor cells resemble murine hematopoietic cells that express a dominant-negative form of the retinoic acid receptor, RARα. In this paper, we have tested the hypothesis that v-Ski and its cellular homologue c-Ski exert their effects by interfering with nuclear hormone receptor-induced transcription. We demonstrate that Ski associates with the RAR complex and can repress transcription from a retinoic acid response element. The physiological significance of <b>this</b> <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by the ability of high concentrations of a RARα-specific ligand to abolish v-Ski-induced transformation of the multipotent progenitors. These results strongly suggest that the ability of Ski to alter cell differentiation is caused {{in part by the}} modulation of RAR signaling pathways...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the issue of drone strikes as a means of {{targeted}} killing of high value targets suspected of terrorist activities or affiliations. The United States of America has been using this method of elimination since the year 2001 as part of the Global War on Terrorism. However this practice raises a series of moral questions. It creates a new environment of alienation of the target and the person pulling the trigger. This thesis examines the compliance of drone strikes and the Global War on Terrorism as such with the Just War Theory.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of hydraulic transmissivity of permeable fracture reservoirs {{is a very}} important task in the exploration of water resources and hydrocarbons. Previ-ous studies that model the permeable structure as a single fluid-filled fracture failed to explain the observed significant Stoneley wave attenuation across the permeable struc-ture. In this paper, the structure is modeled as a permeable fracture zone and synthetic Stoneley wave seismograms {{in the vicinity of the}} structure are calculated. The results show that Stoneley waves can be strongly attenuated or even eliminated without sig-nificant reflection, because of the dissipation of wave energy into the permeable zone. Several field cases are also modeled and the theoretical results are compared with the field data. It is shown that low- and medium-frequency Stoneley waves (1 kHz data from Moodus, Conneticut, and 5 kHz data from Monitoba, Canada) are very sensitive to the permeability of the fractures and can be used to assess permeability from in-situ logging data, if the fracture porosity and zone thickness can be measured. At high frequencies, however, Stoneley waves are not very sensitive to permeability but are mainly affected by the sum of the fracture openings expressed as the product of fracture zone thickness 44 Tang et al. and porosity in the fracture zone. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by a logging data set (Monitoba, Canada) obtained using high-frequency Stoneley waves at 34 kHz...|$|E

Two manipulative experiments were designed to study the effects of overgrowth of invasive species on juvenile colonies of the Mediterranean gorgonian Paramuricea clavata, an important structural species in coralligenous assemblages.

40|$|AbstractElectrophoresis of {{a mixture}} of NaCl and CaCl 2 in a {{lysozyme}} crystal is investigated using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Upon exposure to an electric field, the stability of lysozyme is found to decrease slightly. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by increases in the root mean-square deviations of the heavy atoms of lysozyme, in the solvent-accessible surface area of hydrophobic residues, and {{in the number of}} hydrogen bonds between lysozyme and water. The solvent-accessible surface area of hydrophilic residues changes marginally, and the number of hydrogen bonds between lysozyme molecules decreases. Water molecules tend to align preferentially parallel to the electric field, and the dipole moment along the pore axis increases linearly with increasing field strength. Two pronounced layered structures are observed for Na+ and Ca 2 + in the vicinity of protein surface, but only one enriched layer is observed for Cl−. The number distributions of all ions are nearly independent of the electric field. The water coordination numbers of all ions are smaller in the crystal than in aqueous bulk solution; however, the reverse is found for the Cl− coordination numbers of cations. Both the water and the Cl− coordination numbers are insensitive to the electric field. Ion diffusivities in the crystal are ∼ 2 orders of magnitude smaller than those in aqueous bulk solution. The drift velocities of ions increase proportionally to the electric field, particularly at high strengths, and depend on ionic charge and coordination with oppositely charged ions. Electrical current exhibits a linear relationship with the field strength. The zero-field electrical conductivity is estimated to be 0. 56 S/m, which is very close to 0. 61 S/m as predicted by the Nernst-Einstein equation...|$|E
40|$|Através da análise das relações existentes entre as medidas de risco e as medidas de eficiência de testes de diagnóstico ou triagem, são discutidos os problemas e limitações concernentes ao uso de fatores de risco na predição da distribuição de efeitos (infecção, doença, cura) em uma população. Para ilustrar o tema, foi utilizada a associação, em crianças, entre a questão "você já tomou banhos em rios?", muito utilizada em anamneses clínicas ensinadas em diversas escolas médicas do Brasil, e a infecção pelo Schistosoma mansoni. A história de banhos em rios, enquanto um importante fator de risco, mostrou-se mau preditor da ocorrência da infecção esquistossomótica. A análise demonstrou que este achado é, em grande parte, devido a baixa freqüência de história negativa de banhos em rios. Porém, a possibilidade da utilização de fatores de risco isoladamente ou agrupados, com o objetivo de predição de efeitos, é possível e desejável.

The {{analysis}} {{of the relationship between}} those parameters used to measure risk and those used to measure efficiency of diagnostic or screening tests is used, in this paper, to demonstrate the limitations of the use of risk factors as predictors of outcomes distribution in a population. The issue was illustrated by the study of the association, in children, of reported bathing in rivers by asking children if they bathed in rivers and the occurrence of Schistosoma mansoni infection.

40|$|Base processes’ is {{the central}} concept of this research. ‘Base processes’ is the term I coined to refer to {{underlying}} workings in the ocean environment that are expressed through movements, cycles and forces. The key finding in this overall research: As an artist, {{it is possible to}} visualize and perceive phenomena in the ocean environment as though seeing it for the first time, as an assemblage of ‘base processes’ that describe the underlying workings of nature. Further to this, during my field research I witnessed impacts of climate change. It is envisaged that climate change will increasingly degrade the ocean environment. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> through my ‘sculptural assemblages’. I extend the parameters of sculptural ceramic practice. ‘Sculptural assemblage’ refers to my installation practice, that includes ceramics, mixed media, video and spatial concepts. This methodology offers the viewer a visual, physical, conceptual, and tactile experience. The three core areas in this research investigation are: sculptural form, material qualities and ‘climate change’ concepts. This is an art practice led research project. Exegesis documentation outlines field research investigations and studio explorations. Field research is my fundamental research methodology to investigate ‘base processes’. This approach offers: first–hand observation and knowledge, spatial perceptions, and close–up visualization of physical and intangible phenomena. My research focuses on underwater reefs, intertidal zones, icebergs and glacial environments. Ocean phenomena are mostly investigated through their movements rather than their stationary appearance. Changeable ocean processes and phenomena are observed, imaged and made concrete through ‘sculptural assemblages’. As part of research into ‘base processes’, I examine the interactions between water, earth, fire and air as foundational elements of life. This is interpreted through clay and glaze materials that are transformed through studio ‘making’ and firing processes into a tangible expression of ‘base processes’. My artworks celebrate the wonder of the ocean environment, but also draw attention to impacts from ocean acidification, coral bleaching and global warming and to the bio–diversity that may be lost. Transformational states represented through my sculptural forms imply natural processes that have gone awry due to climate change. My documentation references scientific data on climate change impacts. The two major ‘sculptural assemblages’ produced during this project are Reef Lab 2012 and Melt 2012. My artworks are visually–poetic expressions of ‘base processes’. ‘Other world’ is a term I use in my research to refer to unfamiliar, enigmatic phenomena that I experience in this world.

40|$|AbstractThe liver {{has been}} {{suspected}} {{to be one}} of the major targets of dengue virus infection. Here, we detected increasing secretion of the chemokine RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), which functions to recruit the immune cells, in dengue-virus-infected liver cells and patients. Three luciferase reporter genes with various deletions at the 5 ′-end of the RANTES promoter were constructed to explore the RANTES activation mechanism in human liver cells. The reporter gene was optimally activated by dengue- 2 virus when the RANTES promoter contains the region from the transcription starting site (+ 1) to the nucleotide at the − 181 position. NF-IL- 6 and an undefined factor forming DNA–protein complexes in the RANTES promoter E and A/B regions in the infected cells <b>were</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Further analysis showed that oxidative stress was an upstream inducer of NF-IL- 6 and RANTES signaling in dengue-virus-infected liver cells. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by three antioxidants (N-acetyl-l-cysteine, nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate) used to suppress the activation. In contrast, the DNA binding activity of the undefined factor was not affected by the antioxidant treatment, indicating the existence of an oxidant-independent pathway. We hypothesize that dengue virus infection of the liver cells may trigger both an oxidant-dependent and an oxidant-independent pathway to up-regulate RANTES mRNA expression through activating NF-IL- 6 and an undefined factor, respectively. In conclusion, the present study suggests a new direction for the study of liver pathogenesis involving RANTES in host immune responses during dengue virus infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this project has been to {{evaluate}} and compare {{the effect of the}} intrinsic differences between cobalt (Co) and iron (Fe) catalysts for Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis using coal-derived syngas. Crude oil, especially heavy, high-sulfur crude, is no longer the appropriate source for the additional, or marginal, amounts of middle-distillate fuels needed to meet growing US and world demand for diesel and jet fuels. Only about 1 / 3 of the marginal crude oil barrel can be made into diesel and jet fuels. The remaining 2 / 3 contributes further to global surpluses of by-products. FT can produce these needed marginal, low-sulfur middle-distillate fuels more efficiently, with less environmental impact, and from abundant US domestic resources. Cobalt FT catalyst is more efficient, and less expensive overall, than iron FT catalyst. Mechanisms of cobalt FT catalyst functioning, and poisoning, have been elucidated. Each of these primary findings is amplified by several secondary findings, and these are presented, and verified in detail. The most effective step the United States can take to begin building toward improved long-term national energy security, and to reduce dependence, over time, on imported crude oil from unfriendly and increasingly unstable areas of the world, is to begin producing additional, or marginal amounts of, middle-distillate-type fuels, such as ultralow sulfur diesel (ULSD) and jet fuel (not gasoline) from US domestic resources other than petroleum. FT synthesis of these middle distillate fuels offers the advantage of being able to use abundant and affordable US coal and biomass as the primary feedstocks. Use of the cobalt FT catalyst system has been shown conclusively to be more effective and less expensive than the use of iron FT catalyst with syngas derived from coal, or from coal and biomass combined. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> in detail for the initial case of a relatively small FT plant of about 2000 barrels per day based upon coal and biomass. The primary feature of such a plant, in the current situation in which no commercial FT plants are operating in the US, is that it requires a relatively modest capital investment, meaning that such a plant could actually be built, operated, and replicated in the near term. This is in contrast to the several-billion dollar investment, and accompanying risk, that would be required for a plant of more than an order of magnitude greater capacity, which has been referred to in the technical literature on fuel production as the capacity required to be considered "commercial-scale. " The effects of more than ten different potential poisons for cobalt FT catalyst have been studied extensively and in detail using laboratory continuous-stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) and bottled laboratory syngas "spiked" with precisely controlled amounts of the poisons, typically at the levels of 10 s or 100 s of parts per billion. This data set has been generated and interpreted by world-renowned experts on FT catalysis at the University of Kentucky Center for Applied Energy Research (UK-CAER), and has enabled unprecedented insight regarding the many molecular-scale mechanisms that can {{play a role in the}} "poisoning" of cobalt FT catalyst...|$|E

In this study, a framework for the longitudinal analysis of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) -based mapping {{was applied to the}} assessment of predefined white matter tracts in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as an example for a rapid progressive neurodegenerative disease. Methods: DTI was performed every 3 months in six patients with ALS (mean (M) = 7. 7; range 3 to 15 scans) and in six controls (M = 3; range 2 – 5 scans) with the identical scanning protocol, resulting in a total of 65 longitudinal DTI datasets. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axonal diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and the ratio AD/RD were studied to analyze alterations within the corticospinal tract (CST) which is a prominently affected tract structure in ALS and the tract correlating with Braak’s neuropathological stage 1. A correlation analysis was performed between progression rates based on DTI metrics and the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALS-FRS-R). Results: Patients with ALS showed an FA and AD/RD decline along the CST, while DTI metrics of controls did not change in longitudinal DTI scans. The FA and AD/RD decrease progression correlated significantly with ALS-FRS-R decrease progression. Conclusion: On the basis of the longitudinal assessment, DTI-based metrics can be considered as a possible noninvasive follow-up marker for disease progression in neurodegeneration. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> here for ALS as a fast progressing neurodegenerative disease...|$|R

Using a protein microarray, we identified PIM 1 as the downstream partner of GBP 1, recruited into the cytoskeleton under hypoxic conditions. The clinical value of these observations was tested by performing an archive study of 98 ovarian cancer patients, which demonstrated that the βIII-tubulin -/PIM 1 - cohort responded to treatment, exhibiting long overall survival (OS), while βIII-tubulin +/PIM+ patients experienced poor outcomes and OS times similar to patients receiving palliation alone. βIII-tubulin expression is commonly believed responsible for paclitaxel resistance due to its enhancement of the dynamic instability of microtubules, which counteracts the activity of taxanes. In contrast, our research reveals that βIII-tubulin behaves as a gateway for prosurvival signals, such as PIM 1, {{to move into the}} cytoskeleton. When cells are exposed to microenvironmental stressors, they activate this pathway by telling the cytoskeleton to incorporate PIM 1 through GBP 1 and βIII-tubulin, which ultimately leads to drug resistance. This discovery reveals that βIII-tubulin does not act alone but requires partners to play its role. The discovery of such protein:protein interactions underlying this prosurvival cascade makes feasible the development of therapeutic approaches using novel compounds that are capable of inhibiting the transmission of prosurvival signals into the cytoskeleton...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a new adaptive forecasting model using a knowledge guided {{artificial neural network}} (KGANN) structure for efficient prediction of exchange rate. The new structure has two parallel systems. The first system is a least mean square (LMS) trained adaptive linear combiner, whereas the second system employs an adaptive FLANN model to supplement the knowledge base with an objective to improve its performance value. The output of a trained LMS model is added to an adaptive FLANN model {{to provide a more}} accurate exchange rate compared to that predicted by either a simple LMS or a FLANN model. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> has <b>been</b> <b>demonstrated</b> through an exhausting computer simulation study and using real life data. Thus the proposed KGANN is an efficient forecasting model for exchange rate prediction...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to increase teacher awareness of the possible relationships of learning style and locus of control on student achievement, to contribute to research in business education relating to both learning style and locus of control, to describe students' learning styles and locus of control attitudes, to provide a planned approach to using learning style and locus of control instruments, and to develop procedures for diagnosing learning style and locus of control attitudes. The population studied consisted of 74 students enrolled in Word Processing I instruction at the Hinds Junior College District in Mississippi. All of the respondents were females. The predictor variable was performance based on numerical final grade in the course. The control variables were (1) learning style which is derived from 20 learning style indicator scores using the Canfield Learning Styles Inventory and (2) locus of control which is based on one score from the Rotter Internal-External Locus of Control Scale. Five hypotheses were tested. Pearson product-moment correlations, multiple correlations, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedures were used to study the hypotheses. All tests of significance were at the. 050 level of confidence. The best variable for predicting performance in Word Processing I instruction was locus of control. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by using the stepwise selection of control variables in the multiple regression model. The four learning style indicators which significantly related to performance in Word Processing I instruction were Authority, Competition, Independence, and Expectancy Score D. No difference was found between performance and the two methods of instruction (individualized versus a combination of methods) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIsoprene is emitted {{in large}} {{quantities}} by vegetation, exhaled by human beings and released in small quantities by road traffic. As {{a result of its}} high reactivity, isoprene is an important ozone precursor in the troposphere and can {{play a key role in}} atmospheric chemistry. Measurements of isoprene in urban areas in Central Europe are scarce. Thus, in Essen, Germany, the isoprene concentration was measured at various sites during different seasons using two compact online GC-PID systems. Isoprene concentrations were compared with those of benzene and toluene, which represent typical anthropogenic VOCs. In the summer, the diurnal variation in isoprene concentration was dependent on the biogenic emissions in the city. It was found that its maximum concentration occurred during the day, in contrast to the benzene and toluene concentrations. During the measurement period in the summer of 2012, the average hourly isoprene concentrations reached 0. 13 to 0. 17 ppb between 10 and 20 LST. At high air temperatures, the isoprene concentration exceeded the benzene and toluene concentrations at many of the sites. Isoprene became more important than toluene with regard to ozone formation in the city area during the afternoon hours of summer days with high air temperatures. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by the contributions to OH reactivity and ozone-forming potential. It contradicts the results of other studies, which were based on daily or seasonal average values. With an isoprene/benzene ratio of 0. 02, the contribution of anthropogenic isoprene decreased substantially to a very low level during the last 20 years in Central Europe due to a strong reduction in road traffic emissions. In the vicinity of many people, isoprene concentrations of up to 0. 54 ppb and isoprene/benzene ratios of up to 1. 34 were found in the atmosphere due to isoprene exhaled by humans...|$|R
40|$|Some of the antigens {{that are}} capable of {{producing}} strain-related immunity to gono-coccal infection in the guinea pig are located on the outer membrane of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> has <b>been</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by immunization of guinea pigs with isolated outer membranes from two different strains of N. gonorrhoeae prior to challenge. Isolated principal outer membrane protein complex proved a better protective immunogen than purified pili from the same strain of N. gonorrhoeae. Principal outer membrane protein appears to react in antibody-complement-medi-ated killing of gonococci, whereas antibodies to pili are only weakly bactericidal. Pili-mediated attachment of N. gonorrhoeae to human cells is inhibited by anti-bodies to pili, and maximal inhibition occurs when antibodies are directed at pili antigenically identical to the pili mediating the attachment.

40|$|About {{one-third of}} acromegalics are {{resistant}} to the clinically available somatostatin analogs (SA). The resistance is related to density reduction or different expression of somatostatin receptor subtypes (SSTR). This study analyzes SSTR`s expression in somatotrophinomas, comparing to SA response, hormonal levels, and tumor volume. We analyzed 39 somatotrophinomas; 49 % were treated with SA. The most expressed SSTR was SSTR 5, SSTR 3, SSTR 2, SSTR 1, and SSTR 4, respectively. SSTR 1 and SSTR 2 had higher expression in patients that had normalized GH and IGF-I. SSTR 3 was more expressed in patients with tumor reduction. There was {{a positive correlation between}} the percentage of tumor reduction and SSTR 1, SSTR 2 and SSTR 3 expression. Also, a positive correlation between SSTR 2 mRNA expression and the immunohistochemical reactivity of SSTR 2 was found. Our study confirmed the association between the SA response to GH and IGF-I and the SSTR 2. Additionally, <b>this</b> <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> also <b>demonstrated</b> in relation to SSTR 1...|$|R
40|$|Apoptosis in glomerular sclerosis. Glomerulosclerosis is {{characterized}} by progressive extracellular matrix accumulation and glomerular cell loss. The role of glomerular cell apoptosis in glomerulosclerosis was investigated in the rat remnant kidney model and in human glomerular diseases. We identified apoptotic cells in the glomeruli, tubules and interstitium in the remnant kidney by electron microscopy. DNA fragmentation, which is a biochemical characteristic of apoptosis, was detected by in situ nick end-labeling of fragmented DNA with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and biotinylated deoxyuridine triphosphate. Fragmented DNA in the glomeruli and tubules increased with the progression of glomerulosclerosis in the remnant kidney model. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> also <b>demonstrated</b> in other glomerular sclerotic lesions such as IgA and lupus nephritis. The number of cells positive for nick end-labeling in the glomerulus significantly correlated with the degree of glomerulosclerosis and the deterioration of renal function. These results indicate that apoptosis is, at least in part, involved in the cell deletion of various glomerular diseases leading to sclerosis...|$|R
40|$|Generalized {{capillary}} dysfunction is a morbid {{element in}} the metabolic syndrome, {{and it is likely}} involved in its complications. We tested the hypothesis that vast amounts of serum albumin previously observed in kidneys of rats with the metabolic syndrome were caused, in part, by leakage from renal peritubular capillaries. We report herein large scale leaks of plasma fluid in peritubular capillaries of rats with the metabolic syndrome. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> directly <b>demonstrated</b> in vivo, and the presence of leftover albumin residue confirmed the leak in post-mortem kidney specimens. Moreover, renal interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy were found in a distribution similar to the leaked renal albumin in obese rats. We suggest that there is an important link between peritubular capillary damage and interstitial fibrosis, represented as tubulo-interstitial disease in the metabolic syndrome. We propose that maintenance of the peritubular microcirculation may improve renal outcomes in diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Page 3 of 35...|$|R
40|$|Reasoning {{from all}} {{knowledge}} and belief is an adaptive approach {{to thinking about}} the world. It has been robustly shown that conditional ‘if then’ reasoning with everyday content {{is influenced by the}} background knowledge an individual has available. If we are presented with the statement ‘if it rains, then John will get wet’ then we are told that it is raining and asked if John will get wet, we may consider a number of possibilities before answering the question; perhaps John has an umbrella or is sheltered from the rain. Hence, when engaged in conditional reasoning of this sort people typically draw on background knowledge to arrive at an informed response. People with autism tend not to process information in context. There is a wealth of evidence indicating that these individuals have a piecemeal rather than an integrative processing style. It was therefore hypothesised that adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) would be less influenced by background knowledge when engaged in conditional reasoning with everyday content. Adolescents with ASD showed a weak or absent effect of available background knowledge on reasoning outcomes compared to a typically developing control group. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> in two separate conditional reasoning tasks. These results were not explained by a failure to generate background knowledge or by differences in the beliefs held by the two groups regarding problem content. Within the typical population a lack of contextualised reasoning was also found among participants with high scores on one particular autistic trait, attention to detail. The ability to integrate all relevant information during conditional reasoning was also found to be dependent on available working memory resources. These results extend the known domains which demonstrate a lack of contextualised processing in autism. They also show that for individuals with autism reasoning without regard for background knowledge stems from a failure to integrate information. The <b>findings</b> suggest that <b>this</b> failure is related to the cognitive demands of the task and the processing style of the individual.
