5|$|A bodyline {{delivery}} was {{one where}} the cricket ball was bowled at {{the body of the}} batsman, in the hope that when he defended himself with his bat, a resulting deflection could be caught by one of several fielders standing close by. This was considered by critics to be intimidatory and physically threatening, {{to the point of being}} unfair in a game <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> uphold gentlemanly traditions.|$|E

The first twelve died while working on a pier foundation when a caisson <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> hold back the river water flooded, drowning the workers. Another four men died a few months after that when a wooden beam broke while working on a different pier caisson.|$|E

5|$|An {{attempt to}} obtain {{information}} for Operation Dexterity, the attack on New Britain, with a joint Army-Navy reconnaissance team raised issues of inter-service cooperation. The Navy was mainly interested in gathering hydrographic data rather than information {{on the state of}} the Japanese defenders. Because of a breakdown in communications, the PT boat <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> collect the team was unable to rendezvous with it, and the team had to spend eleven more days on the island. Finally, the Navy tried to prevent the Army commander from briefing Alamo Force headquarters on what had occurred.|$|E
5|$|Andersen {{was accused}} of crimes on several {{occasions}} in the post-war years, but was most often acquitted in court. Amongst the crimes {{of which he was}} charged but acquitted in court was the theft of building materials in 1954. Another time he was tricked into lending his car to two people who broke into a goldsmith's shop in Tønsberg. Strongly intoxicated {{at the time of the}} crime, he was charged but fully acquitted. In 1955 he was, however, convicted and sentenced to 36days in prison for selling 30bottles of denatured alcohol, alcohol <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> have been used at his factory.|$|E

The left wing of the Grande Armée would move from Hanover in northern Germany and Utrecht in the Netherland to fall on Württemberg; the right and center, troops from the Channel coast, would concentrate along the Middle Rhine around cities like Mannheim and Strasbourg. While Murat was making demonstrations across the Black Forest, other French forces would then invade the German heartland and swing towards the southeast by capturing Augsburg, a move <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> isolate Mack and interrupt the Austrian lines of communication.|$|E
5|$|The {{term for}} the {{president}} is five years, but due to a 1996 referendum, the election <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> occur in 1999 was pushed back to 2001. Under the 1994 constitution, the president could only serve for two terms as president, but due {{to a change in}} the constitution, term limits were eliminated. During the course of the office, elections were held in 1994, 2001, 2006, 2010 and on 11 October 2015. Alexander Lukashenko has been the only person who has served as president since the elections in 1994.|$|E

5|$|Life for the blue-collar men of {{the port}} is {{increasingly}} hard and work is scarce. As union leader, Sobotka has taken it on himself to reinvigorate the port by lobbying politicians to support much-needed infrastructure improvement initiatives. Lacking the funds needed {{for this kind of}} influence, Sobotka has become involved with a smuggling ring. Around him, his son and nephew also turn to crime, as they have few other opportunities to earn money. It becomes clear to the Sobotka detail that the dead girls are related to their investigation, as they were in a container <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be smuggled through the port. They again use wiretaps to infiltrate the crime ring and slowly work their way up the chain towards The Greek, the mysterious man in charge. But Valchek, upset that their focus has moved beyond Sobotka, gets the FBI involved. The Greek has a mole inside the FBI and starts severing his ties to Baltimore when he learns about the investigation.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at 09:35, two USAF F-15C fighter {{aircraft}} {{from the}} 53d Fighter Squadron, piloted by Captain Eric Wickson and Lieutenant Colonel Randy W. May, departed Incirlik AB. Their {{mission was to}} perform an initial fighter sweep of the TAOR to clear the area of any hostile aircraft prior to the entry of coalition forces. The air tasking order (ATO) <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> list all scheduled coalition aircraft missions for that day and which the two pilots reviewed before takeoff, mentioned that U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters would be operating in the TAOR that day but did not list takeoff times, routes, or flight durations for them. At 10:15, Wickson radioed Martin on the AWACS {{and asked if he}} had any information to pass to them to which Martin replied in the negative.|$|E
5|$|With Đính and the Ngô family's {{increasing}} {{focus on}} the political usage of the army, the military situation in the III Corps deteriorated badly {{in the second half}} of 1963, as personnel were redeployed into the cities. In August, he moved a unit away from Bến Tượng, which had been portrayed as a model settlement in the Strategic Hamlet Program <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> isolate peasants into fortified villages to keep the Viet Cong out. While the unit was in Saigon cracking down on the Buddhists, the communists overran Bến Tượng. A year earlier, the American media contingent had been invited to the opening ceremony of the settlement, which was supposed to be the flagship of the hamlet program. As Đính spent most of October in the capital plotting instead of inspecting the countryside, the communists began to systematically dismantle the strategic hamlets.|$|E

5|$|Following the public's {{positive}} {{reaction to the}} graphics of the Final Fantasy VII Technical Demo for PS3 presented at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 2005, {{it was decided to}} release the role-playing video game Final Fantasy XIII on the PlayStation 3 rather than the PlayStation 2 as originally planned. In August 2005, the Technology Division began working on the White Engine, a PlayStation 3 engine <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be exclusively used for Final Fantasy XIII. Eight months later, however, it was decided to repurpose the engine to further make it compatible with other projects such as the action RPG Final Fantasy Versus XIII (later rebranded and repurposed into Final Fantasy XV) and the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) Final Fantasy XIV. In order for the company to stay competitive in a multi-platform environment, support of the engine was extended from the PlayStation 3 to the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows, both of which were successful in Western markets. This marked the official development start of a company-wide engine for whose purpose the Technology Division was expanded into the Research and Development Division in September 2006. Murata remained the division's general manager with a full-time staff at his disposal.|$|E
5|$|Records {{indicate}} that the alignment of PA371 was first constructed as a cut from the Delaware River to the community of Great Bend, Pennsylvania, in1791 through Wayne and Susquehanna Counties. In1801, the state legislature of New York and Pennsylvania brought up the proposal for the Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike (later the Great Bend and Newburgh Turnpike) to connect the Hudson River to the Delaware River. Although the route was finished in New York, the portion in Pennsylvania was not legislated until March29,1804. Construction through Wayne and Susquehanna Counties commenced in1806, with completion of the roadway coming in1811. At that point, the turnpike was extended onto the cut in Pennsylvania to the Susquehanna River. The turnpike was used for transportation of farmers' goods and stock along with a route for pioneers to use for heading westward. After construction of the original CochectonDamascus Bridge in 1817 (and later in 1821), {{the area around the}} bridge became a bustling community. The alignment of what is now PA371 eventually became littered with a large rate of development, with nineteenth-century style buildings constructed in Damascus. The turnpike itself fared poorly later on, and was abandoned in1853. Although the roadway itself was abandoned, the turnpike corporation <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> maintain the roadway remained intact until 1868, when it was dissolved. Even afterwards, the roadway remained the only physical route in the area until at least the1890s.|$|E
5|$|When {{the state}} sign route system {{was created in}} 1934, Sign Route 190 was {{assigned}} to the portion of Route 127 west of Death Valley Junction, while the remainder to Baker became part of Sign Route 127. However, the highway was not continuous, with the roadway from Tipton (which had been built by Tulare County) ending at Quaking Aspen (east of Camp Nelson) and that from Death Valley ending southwest of Lone Pine. In 1923, Tulare County businessmen had begun to push for a new trans-Sierra highway connecting Porterville with Lone Pine, but were set back by a lack of state aid, as the road was not a state highway. The first piece, which {{would turn out to be}} the only one built, opened in early July 1931 to Quaking Aspen (and became a state highway in 1933). Grading of the 15-mile (24km) Western Divide Highway, a county road <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> continue south to State Route 155 at Greenhorn Summit, was completed from Quaking Aspen south to near Johnsondale in July 1962. A new road from Johnsondale across Sherman Pass, maintained by the United States Forest Service and Tulare and Inyo Counties (the latter as County Route J41), was completed in 1976, allowing traffic on the western segment of SR 190 to reach US 395, though via a longer route than the proposed SR 190.|$|E
