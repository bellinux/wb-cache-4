50|$|Managed futures {{accounts}} may {{be traded}} using {{any number of}} strategies, {{the most common of}} which is <b>trend</b> following. <b>Trend</b> following involves buying in markets that are <b>trending</b> higher and selling short in markets that are <b>trending</b> lower. Variations in <b>trend</b> following managers include duration of <b>trend</b> captured (short term, medium term, long term) as well as definition of <b>trend</b> (i.e. what is considered a new high or new low) and the money management/risk management techniques. Other strategies employed by managed futures managers include discretionary strategies, fundamental strategies, option writing, pattern recognition, and arbitrage strategies, among others. However, <b>trend</b> following and variations of <b>trend</b> following are the predominant strategy.|$|R
50|$|<b>Trend</b> {{lines are}} used {{in many ways by}} traders. If a stock price is moving between support and {{resistance}} <b>trend</b> lines, then a basic investment strategy commonly used by traders, is to buy a stock at support and sell at resistance, then short at resistance and cover the short at support. The logic behind this, is that when the price returns to an existing principal <b>trend</b> line it may be an opportunity to open new positions {{in the direction of the}} <b>trend,</b> in the belief that the <b>trend</b> line will hold and the <b>trend</b> will continue further. A second way is that when price action breaks through the principal <b>trend</b> line of an existing <b>trend,</b> it is evidence that the <b>trend</b> may be going to fail, and a trader may consider trading in the opposite direction to the existing <b>trend,</b> or exiting positions in the direction of the <b>trend.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Trend</b> {{recognition}} and <b>trend</b> forecasting {{are very important}} and relevant issues in many Business Intelligence applications. Semantic Web, which is becoming a powerful technology, allows {{the creation of new}} efficient solutions for many corporate problems. The use of Semantic Web technologies to support <b>trend</b> {{recognition and}} <b>trend</b> forecasting in a business context could evidentially enhance the efficiency of corporate decisions. In this paper, we describe the possibilities of applying Semantic Web to <b>trend</b> mining in two business areas: financial markets and market research. We analyze the requirements of these business fields regarding the <b>trend</b> mining aspect. Furthermore, we reflect on <b>trend</b> recognition and <b>trend</b> forecasting methodology using ontologies. We describe TREMA 1, a prototypical BI platform for <b>trend</b> mining, analysis and fusion of multimodal data...|$|R

I show that the <b>trend</b> in the global area-weighted average surface air temperature is different in key details from the population-weighted <b>trend.</b> I extend the index to include urbanization and the urban heat island effect. This substantially changes the <b>trend</b> again. I further extend the index to include international migration, but this has a minor impact on the <b>trend...</b>|$|R

50|$|This {{concept of}} a <b>trend</b> {{is one of the}} primary {{concepts}} in technical analysis. A <b>trend</b> is either up or down and for the complete neophyte observing a market, an upwards <b>trend</b> can be described simply as a period of time over which the price has moved up. An upwards <b>trend</b> is also known as a bull <b>trend,</b> or a rally. A bear <b>trend</b> or downwards <b>trend</b> or sell-off (or crash) is where the market moves downwards. The definition is as simple as the analysis is varied and complex. The assumption is of serial correlation, i.e. once in a <b>trend,</b> the market is likely to continue in that direction.|$|R
40|$|Between 1950 and 2012, boreal summer (rainy season) {{rainfall}} in the Sahel {{changed from}} a multi-decadal decreasing <b>trend</b> to an increasing <b>trend</b> (positive <b>trend</b> shift) in the mid- 1980 s. We found that this <b>trend</b> shift was synchronous with similar <b>trend</b> shifts in global oceanic evaporation and in land precipitation on all continents except the Americas. The <b>trend</b> shift in oceanic evaporation occurred mainly in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) and the subtropical oceans of the Northern Hemisphere (NH). Because increased oceanic evaporation strengthens the atmospheric moisture transport toward land areas, the synchrony of oceanic evaporation and land precipitation is reasonable. Surface scalar winds over the SH oceans also displayed a positive <b>trend</b> shift. Sea surface temperature (SST) displayed a <b>trend</b> shift in the mid- 1980 s that was negative (increasing, then decreasing) in the SH and positive in the NH. Although SST had opposite <b>trend</b> shifts in both hemispheres, the <b>trend</b> shift in evaporation was positive in both hemispheres. We infer that because strong winds promote evaporative cooling, the <b>trend</b> shift in SH winds strengthened the <b>trend</b> shifts in both SST and evaporation in the SH. Because high SST promotes evaporation, the <b>trend</b> shift in NH SST strengthened the NH <b>trend</b> shift in evaporation. Thus differing oceanic roles in the SH and NH generated the positive <b>trend</b> shift in evaporation; however, the details of moisture transport toward the Sahel are still unclear, or perhaps {{there is no single}} determining influence...|$|R

50|$|At {{the start}} of what a trader is hoping is a bull <b>trend,</b> after the first higher low, a <b>trend</b> line {{can be drawn from}} the low at {{the start of}} the <b>trend</b> to the higher low and then extended. When the market moves across this <b>trend</b> line, it has {{generated}} a <b>trend</b> line break for the trader, who is given several considerations from this point on. If the market moved with a particular rhythm to-and-fro from the <b>trend</b> line with regularity, the trader will give the <b>trend</b> line added weight. Any significant <b>trend</b> line that sees a significant <b>trend</b> line break represents a shift in the balance of the market and is interpreted as the first sign that the countertrend traders are able to assert some control.|$|R

30|$|The ADX {{does not}} {{indicate}} <b>trend</b> direction or momentum. It only measures <b>trend</b> strength. It is a lagging indicator {{in a sense that}} a <b>trend</b> must have established firmly before the ADX will generate a signal that a <b>trend</b> is under way. The ADX varies between 0 and 100. Generally, ADX readings below 20 indicate <b>trend</b> weakness and readings above 40 and 50 indicate a strong <b>trend</b> and an extremely strong <b>trend,</b> respectively. However, one major problem with the ADX is that it is too volatile. The ADXR improves over the ADX on this respect by using the average instead of a single number. In general, ADXR less than 20 indicates a trendless market, while ADXR greater than 25 indicates a <b>trending</b> market.|$|R
