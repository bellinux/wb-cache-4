The penalty for all these offences is life imprisonment. However, in the latter situation, a person will not be convicted if he or she voluntarily provides full information of the offence to a police officer before being accused of or charged with the offence.|$|E
5|$|Nickell {{continued}} {{to maintain her}} innocence after her trial. An appeal based on jury-tampering and judicial misconduct issues {{was rejected by the}} United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in August 1989. A second appeal, beginning in 2001 was filed by Nickell's new attorney, Carl Park Colbert, based on evidence obtained by private detectives Al Farr and Paul Ciolino, requesting a new trial on the basis of new evidence having been discovered that the FBI may have withheld documents from the defense. The appeal was denied, though Nickell and her team continue to assert her innocence. She claimed that her daughter Cynthia lied about Nickell's involvement in the case in order to reap the $300,000 of reward money being offered. Cynthia Hamilton eventually collected $250,000 of that money. Nickell also alleges, among other things, that the evidence actually points <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>person</b> as the killer, and that the testimony about various smaller details in the case, such as the store owner who testified about her having purchased Algae Destroyer, was influenced by promises of payment.|$|E

5|$|Buddhist traditions provide {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} how this transfer proceeds. Transferring merit <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>person,</b> usually deceased relatives, is simply done by a mental wish. Despite the word transfer, the merit of the giver {{is in no way}} decreased during such an act, just like a candle used to light another candle does not diminish. The merit transferred cannot always be received, however. The dead relatives must also be able to sympathize with the meritorious act. If the relatives do not receive the merit, the act of transferring merit will still be beneficial for the giver himself. The transfer of merit is thus connected with the idea of rejoicing. The other person who rejoices in one's meritorious deeds, in that way also receives merit, if he approves of the merit done. Thus, rejoicing in others' merits, apart from being one of the ten meritorious acts mentioned, is also a prerequisite for the transferring of merit to occur. The purposes for merit transfer differ. In many Buddhist countries, transferring merit is connected to the notion of an intermediate state. The merit that is transferred to the deceased will help them to cross over safely to the next rebirth. Some Mahāyāna traditions believe that it can help deceased relatives to attain the Pure Land. Another way of transferring merit, apart from helping the deceased, is to dedicate it to the devas (deities), since it is believed that these are not able to make merits themselves. In this way it is believed their favor can be obtained. Finally, many Buddhists transfer merits to resolve a bond of revenge that may exist between people, as it is believed that someone else's vengefulness may create harm in one's life.|$|E

25|$|The initial {{connection}} <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>person</b> {{in a professional}} setting usually starts off with a touch, specifically a handshake. A person's handshake can speak volumes about them and their personality. Chiarella (2006) wrote an article for Esquire magazine explaining to the predominantly male readership how handshakes differ {{from person to person}} and how they send nonverbal messages. He mentioned that holding the grip longer than two seconds will result in a stop in the verbal conversation, thus the nonverbal will override the verbal communication.|$|E

25|$|Genealogical DNA {{tests have}} become {{popular due to}} the ease of testing at home and their {{usefulness}} in supplementing genealogical research.

DNA tests are perceived as more scientific, conclusive and expeditious than searching the civil records. However, they are limited by restrictions on lines that may be studied.

25|$|Kovel {{focuses on}} a {{modified}} version of the notion of ‘Usufruct’ to replace capitalist private property arrangements. As a legal term, Usufruct refers to the legal right to use and derive profit or benefit from property that belongs <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>person,</b> as long as the property is not damaged. According to Kovel, a modern interpretation of the idea is “where one uses, enjoys – and through that, improves – another’s property”, as its Latin etymology “condenses the two meanings of use – as in use-value, and enjoyment – and as in the gratification expressed in freely associated labour”. The idea, according to Kovel, has roots in the Code of Hammurabi and was first mentioned in Roman law “where it applied to ambiguities between masters and slaves with respect to property”; it also features in Islamic Sharia law, Aztec law and the Napoleonic Code.|$|E
