40|$|The {{past two}} decades have seen a {{worldwide}} resurgence in infections caused by Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum, <b>the</b> <b>syphilis</b> spirochete. <b>The</b> well-recognized capacity of <b>the</b> <b>syphilis</b> spirochete for early dissemination and immune evasion has earned it the designation 'the stealth pathogen'. Despite the many hurdles to studying syphilis pathogenesis, most notably the inability to culture and to genetically manipulate T. pallidum, in recent years, considerable {{progress has been made}} in elucidating the structural, physiological, and regulatory facets of T. pallidum pathogenicity.

40|$|Enzyme {{immunoassay}} (EIA) is {{an ideal}} method for screening large numbers of patients for syphilis. We evaluated a novel immune-capture EIA (ICE Syphilis; Murex Diagnostics) that uses three recombinant Treponema pallidum antigens (TpN 15, TpN 17, and TpN 47) and compared the results with those obtained by the native T. pallidum antigen EIA (Captia SelectSyph-G; Centocor) that we currently use for <b>the</b> serodiagnosis of <b>syphilis.</b> Specificity was evaluated by screening 1, 184 unselected serum specimens in parallel by <b>the</b> ICE <b>Syphilis</b> and SelectSyph-G assays, while sensitivity was tested with a panel of 101 serum specimens containing antitreponemal antibodies (treated and untreated) from patients with various stages of infection. The specificity of <b>the</b> ICE <b>Syphilis</b> EIA (99. 8 %) on screening was significantly higher (P < 0. 02) {{than that of the}} SelectSyph-G EIA (99. 2 %). The sensitivity of <b>the</b> ICE <b>Syphilis</b> EIA was significantly higher (P < 0. 01) than that of the SelectSyph-G EIA on both initial (99 versus 91. 4 %) and repeat (100 versus 92. 4 %) testing. <b>The</b> ICE <b>Syphilis</b> EIA was also significantly more sensitive (P < 0. 01) than the fluorescent treponemal antibody-abs (92. 4 %) but not the T. pallidum hemagglutination assay (97. 1 %). Sera containing antitreponemal antibodies gave a much higher antibody index (absorbance of test serum/kit cutoff) by <b>the</b> ICE <b>Syphilis</b> EIA than by the SelectSyph-G EIA. This combined with the overall high sensitivity makes <b>the</b> ICE <b>Syphilis</b> EIA an ideal test for excluding or detecting treponemal infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected patients. <b>The</b> ICE <b>Syphilis</b> EIA was positive with sera from all 15 HIV-infected patients in the study, whereas sera from 3 HIV-infected patients were negative by the SelectSyph-G EIA.

40|$|<b>The</b> Tuskegee <b>Syphilis</b> Study, like <b>the</b> {{traditional}} {{recounting of}} the event, failed {{to acknowledge the}} direct impact of untreated syphilis in women. Arguably, the most infamous biomedical research study ever performed by the United States government is <b>the</b> Tuskegee <b>Syphilis</b> Study, which occurred between 1932 and 1972 in Macon County, Alabama. The stated purpose of <b>the</b> Tuskegee <b>Syphilis</b> Study {{was to determine the}} effects of untreated syphilis on Black men in Macon County, Alabama. Accordingly, historical and legal accounts have primarily told the stories of the male participants of the Study.

To date, there have not been consistent and adequate substantive challenges to the omission of the women affected by the study, whether in historical accounts or contemporary bioethical discourse.

40|$|To {{compare the}} {{clinical}} outcomes of infertile patients {{with and without}} syphilis after in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET), in this case-control study, 320 infertile couples were enrolled and divided into syphilis (n = 160) and control groups (n = 160).

All <b>syphilis</b> patients received <b>the</b> standard anti-syphilis treatment before undergoing IVF/ICSI.
