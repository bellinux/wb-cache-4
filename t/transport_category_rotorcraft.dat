50|$|This part {{contains}} airworthiness {{standards for}} rotorcraft in the <b>transport</b> <b>category.</b> <b>Rotorcraft</b> {{with more than}} 7000 lb maximum takeoff weight and 10 or more passengers are type certified in this part. Rotorcraft with more than 20000 lb maximum takeoff weight must be certified to additional Category A standards defined in this part.|$|E
40|$|The work {{provides}} a methodological {{approach to the}} safety assessment process of a Fly-By-Wire/Flight Control System of a <b>transport</b> <b>category</b> <b>rotorcraft.</b> Starting from {{the review of the}} documents forming the guidelines for the safety assessment process for airborne systems and equipments, the phases of the process are described and practically applied giving an example. The attention is focused on the first phases of the safety assessment process. Once the rotorcraft-level and the system-level functional requirements are defined, a rotorcraft-level Functional Hazard Assessment is carried out for a particular function involving the Flight Control System. A system-level FHA is then carried out pointing out the failure conditions for two different Flight Control System architectures. To give an example about how to conduct the Preliminary System Safety Assessment, a Fault Tree Analysis for a particular system-level functional failure is performed on both architectures, pointing out the effects of different design choices on the safety and operative requirement...|$|E

50|$|A <b>transport</b> <b>category</b> {{helicopter}} {{is permitted}} to have only one main rotor head, and may have only one engine. If a <b>transport</b> <b>category</b> helicopter has only one engine it is only eligible to be a Class B (or Performance Group 2) helicopter. An example of a <b>transport</b> <b>category</b> helicopter with only one engine is the Bell 204/205.|$|R

50|$|A {{principle}} behind <b>transport</b> <b>category</b> {{design standards}} {{is that any}} element in an airplane or helicopter can fail, but the risk of such a failure causing an accident should be extremely low. Consequently <b>transport</b> <b>category</b> airplanes and helicopters have duplicated elements wherever failure of one element is likely to cause an accident. For example, <b>transport</b> <b>category</b> airplanes must {{have at least two}} engines and be flown by at least two pilots. The loads on the wings and tailplanes are usually carried by multiple load paths. If one element of the primary structure fails due to metal fatigue or corrosion the remaining sound elements of the structure must carry the loads until the failed structural element is discovered in routine maintenance. This fail-safe principle is not necessary in airplanes and helicopters that are not certificated in the <b>transport</b> <b>category.</b>|$|R

50|$|If {{an element}} in a <b>transport</b> <b>category</b> {{airplane}} or helicopter is not highly critical, or if its failure is relatively benign, {{it is possible for}} that element not to be duplicated. For example, most <b>transport</b> <b>category</b> airplanes do not have duplicated nosewheel assemblies; and some do not have duplicated wheels on each main undercarriage.|$|R
50|$|The {{airworthiness}} requirements for <b>transport</b> <b>category</b> airplanes {{are contained in}} Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 25 (commonly referred to as part 25 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR)). Manufacturers of <b>transport</b> <b>category</b> airplanes must show that each airplane they produce of a given type design complies with the relevant standards of part 25.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{ergonomics}} {{design of}} <b>transport</b> <b>category</b> airplane cockpit {{is of great}} importance to the efficiency of flight crew operation and has {{a major impact on}} the flight safety. In this work, the ergonomics design elements in the cockpit are analyzed. The elements are collected from airworthiness regulations, industry standards, features of new generation airplane cockpit and the interaction process analysis results. Using hierarchical cluster approach, the ergonomics design elements are clustered, and the ergonomics design elements for <b>transport</b> <b>category</b> airplane cockpit are determined. The cockpit design process is presented on the basis of axiomatic design theory and a framework for ergonomics design of <b>transport</b> <b>category</b> airplane cockpit...|$|R
