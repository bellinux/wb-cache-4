5|$|Most {{judgment}} calls made by {{the official}} scorer under this rule occur in three situations: when an infielder, pitcher, or catcher attempts <b>to</b> <b>put</b> out an unforced preceding runner who is attempting to advance one base, when any fielder attempts and fails <b>to</b> <b>put</b> out a forced preceding runner, and when any fielder attempts and fails <b>to</b> <b>put</b> out an unforced preceding runner who returns to their original base. In these situations, the official scorer is required {{to determine whether the}} batter-runner would have safely reached first base if the defense made an ordinary effort <b>to</b> <b>put</b> him out. If the defense could not be reasonably expected to make the play, the batter is credited with a hit, otherwise he is ruled to have reached by fielder's choice. If an error is made on the attempt <b>to</b> <b>put</b> out a preceding runner, that has no impact on this decision. It is instead noted to have occurred in addition to the hit or fielder's choice.|$|E
