40|$|Kentucky {{bluegrass}} (Poa pratensis L.) is {{a widely}} used, high-quality, sod-producing turfgrass. To maintain an {{acceptable level of quality}} and function requires irrigation in the semiarid regions of the western United States. Landscape water use, however, is coming under increased scrutiny, and reducing water inputs is a goal of many municipalities. To identify Poa germplasm that maintains green color under deficit irrigation over summer seasons, {{this study was designed to}} evaluate the percent of <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> of 24 Kentucky bluegrass cultivars, accessions (including core collections), and other Poa species. Cultivars generally had a higher percent <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> in spring and fall, while several accessions and old U. S. cultivars showed higher <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> during summer months. Other Poa species did not have percent <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> values above any cultivars and as a group consistently performed the lowest. Core collections of Kentucky bluegrass, aimed at representing overall variability of the species with fewer accessions, had variance estimates equal to or higher than the overall group of accessions. Seven cultivars and accessions consistently had higher percent <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> than the Midnight cultivar check during the August data collection dates, highlighting the potential to improve Kentucky bluegrass <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> over summer seasons under deficit irrigation...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{green spaces}} {{with a wide}} variety of {{functions}} to ameliorate the urban environment have been decreased and fragmented in the urban fringe areas of Southeast Asian cities. In order to elaborate practical and efficient plans to conserve urban green spaces, and to monitor them continuously. From this view point, we inspected <b>green</b> <b>cover,</b> land-use and landholding, and their correlations in the urban fringe of Bangkok using GIS. As a result, the following four facts are revealed. First, urbanization has been proceeding together with land fragmentation, and <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> is finally diminished after the construction of a new house on a subdivided vacant plot. Second, rural land-uses sustain high <b>green</b> <b>cover,</b> while urban land-uses have relatively low <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> with a several range depending on the type of housing. Third, rural land-use is tied to a canal, whereas urban land-use is linked with a road; besides these development patterns influence on the distribution of green spaces.

40|$|Eleven sites, {{representing}} different urban morphologies across central Beijing, {{are used}} to simulate urban heat island effects and explore the relationship between urban planning indicators and climate indicators such as daily maximum and minimum surface temperatures. The results indicate that mesoscale urban planning indicators can explain {{the majority of the}} urban climate differences among the sites. For example, <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> ratio and floor area ratio can explain 94. 47 - 98. 57 % of the variance for daily maximum surface temperature, <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> ratio and building height can explain 98. 94 - 99. 12 % of the variance for daily minimum surface temperature, and floor area ratio, <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> ratio and building density together can explain 99. 49 - 99. 69 % of the variance for time of peak surface temperature. Furthermore, <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> ratio is identified as the most significant urban planning indicator affecting the urban thermal environment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|A {{portable}} dual-camera {{video system}} {{was used to}} evaluate the potential for using total projected <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> as an indirect measure of weed infestations in a wheat crop during early growth stages. The video system would have applications in mapping weed infestations to assist precision farming operations. The two cameras provided a real-time composite image of reflected light measured in red (640 nm), and near-infrared (860 nm) wavelengths. A simple ratio of reflected light intensity in each wavelength was used to isolate the growing plants from the background. Software was developed to automatically adjust for varying ambient light conditions and calculate the percentage of the image occupied by growing plants. Total <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> was measured at randomly selected sites prior to direct seeding wheat and at four growth stages following wheat emergence. The portion of <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> observed was compared to crop and weed dry matter at each location. Weed infestations at each location were estimated by measuring the total <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> and subtracting the projected <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> due to the crop alone. A minimum weed dry matter of 20 g/m 2 and 30 g/m 2 could be detected by the video system at the 3 -leaf and 5 -leaf growth stages, respectively. Weed dry matter less than 20 g/m 2 could not be detected reliably due to the variability of the wheat crop. Detection of weeds within the crop beyond the 5 -leaf stage using this method was difficult due to crop canopy closure...|$|R

40|$|Nature’s {{services}} provided by <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> are important to environmental conditions in cities {{and their ability to}} adapt to climate change. Researchers using geospatial technologies have dramatically increased the spatial and temporal resolution of knowledge about the distribution of tree and shrub cover in cities. Much of the current research on tree cover in cities has concentrated on individual preferences and associations between socioeconomic characteristics and environmental conditions. To complement existing research and provide planners with the practical tools they need to maintain the benefits of urban nature, this study focuses on the public policy factors that influence tree and other <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> at the lot and neighbourhood scales, concentrating on single family neighbourhoods. <b>Green</b> <b>cover</b> is classified using an object-oriented method with high spatial-resolution aerial imagery and GIS techniques. Landscape and property information were extracted from Los Angeles County Assessor Office files at a parcel scale for 20 cities in Los Angeles County. The extracted variables included lot size, floor-area ratio, residential landscape standards, tree protection ordinances, and street tree programs and were used along with average temperature and rainfall information in multiple regression models to explain the distribution and character of <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> across different neighbourhoods. 1...|$|R

40|$|Soil {{management}} {{is one of}} the key practices that influence vegetative and reproductive activity of the olive tree. Tillage, <b>green</b> <b>covers</b> (permanent or <b>temporary),</b> herbicide applications and mulching are all used in olive growing, although tillage is still the preferred method worldwide. Tillage allows to remove weeds, supply fertilizers easily, store precipitation water, and favours mineralization of organic matter. Yet, tillage promotes erosion in sloping areas with considerable soil losses. <b>Green</b> <b>covers</b> reduce erosion and ease trafficking of machinery when the soil is moist, as it often happens at harvesting. However, permanent <b>green</b> <b>covers</b> increase water consumption and this may be detrimental in arid climates. Herbicide applications and mulching are no so common as tillage or <b>green</b> <b>covers</b> in Italian olive orchards. Herbicides eliminate weeds but have a greater environmental impact than other methods of soil management. Herbicides are often used only along the tree row-combined with intercropping or tillage in the inter-row to reduce chemical inputs in the orchard. Mulching with polyethylene sheets is mainly limited by the cost and difficulty of disposing plastic sheets, whereas mulching with organic material is limited to family-run olive orchards because of shortage of mulching material.
