40|$|Appointment {{scheduling}} {{systems are}} utilized mainly by specialty care clinics to manage access to service providers {{as well as}} by hospitals to schedule patient appointments.

Timely availability of doctors is critical whenever <b>a</b> patient needs <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> specialist <b>doctor</b> for treatment and a serious bottleneck lies in the application of appropriate technology techniques to enhance appointment scheduling.

40|$|Care {{is better}} coordinated when doctors have {{personal}} responsibility for their patients. Continuity {{and a sense of}} personal responsibility are becoming more difficult to provide in hospitals, {{in part because of the}} European Working Time Directive. However, in many countries general practitioners are self-employed and able to organise their practices as they wish. In the UK, they increasingly do so in ways that make it difficult for patients to get continuity of care. This is despite most patients being clear that they want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> regular <b>doctor,</b> and professional bodies in primary care consistently promoting continuity as a core value. General practitioners need to decide whether continuity of care matters. If it does, then they need to take a lead in ensuring that care is organised so that patients who want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> regular <b>doctor</b> are able to do so. Suggestions are included for how contemporary practice can be organised to promote this traditional but still highly relevant value. </p...|$|R

Twenty-five percent of men aged 45 to 60 do not have a personal physician, increasing their risk of death from heart disease.

40|$|Background Medical {{abortion}} (mifepristone and misoprostol) has {{the potential}} to contribute to reduced maternal mortality but {{little is known about the}} provision or quality of advice for medical abortion through the private retail sector. We examined the availability of medical abortion and the practices of pharmacists in India, where abortion has been legal since 1972. Methods We interviewed 591 pharmacists in 60 local markets in city, town and rural areas of Madhya Pradesh. One month later, we returned to 359 pharmacists with undercover patients who presented themselves unannounced as genuine customers seeking a medical abortion. Results Medical abortion was offered to undercover patients by 256 (71. 3 %) pharmacists and 24 dif-ferent brands were identified. Two thirds (68. 5 %) of pharmacists stated that abortion was il-legal in India.

25|$|In {{the sixth}} year of her {{confinement}} in the sanatorium Madonna’s younger brother Orby, {{who also had}} tuberculosis, died. He had begged his sister to have their parents take him home from the sanatorium {{so that he could}} die at home. He was taken home and died later the same day. After being denied the opportunity to attend her brother’s funeral, and the thought of dying in the sanatorium added to Madonna’s desire to leave, which she did without permission and returned to her family home. Facing the threat of quarantine her father refused to return Madonna to the Indian sanatorium. Instead he wrote to an old school friend, Henry Standing Bear, who advised them <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> in Pierre and gain admittance to the “white” TB sanatorium, Sanator at Custer, SD. This was not simple, again due to discrimination because they were Indians the authorities denied her admittance to Sanator, telling them that they {{had to go back to}} the Sioux San. Madonna’s father James Hart Swan would not accept this denial and he gained an audience with the governor of South Dakota, Judge Sigurd Anderson. James Swam explained their situation and the governor, who considered himself somewhat of a pioneer for human rights, understood that American Indians were not treated fairly, arranged for Madonna to be admitted to Sanator.|$|E
