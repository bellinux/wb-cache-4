Farmers with optimum sowing and optimum harvest were <b>technically</b> more <b>efficient</b> than the farmers with late sowing. In all farms technical efficiency was much higher for the farmers who use sandy loam soil for wheat production than the farmers who did not use sandy loam soil. There was a positive relationship between the educational level and technical efficiency of wheat practicing farmers.

Therefore, maintaining of optimum sowing and harvesting time, use of sandy loam soil, high level of farming experience and education are important factors for obtaining maximum achievable yield.

Rogers' five stages (steps): awareness, interest, evaluation, trial, and adoption are integral to this theory. An individual might reject an innovation at any time during or after the adoption process. Abrahamson examined this process critically by posing questions such as: How do technically inefficient innovations diffuse and what impedes <b>technically</b> <b>efficient</b> innovations from catching on? Abrahamson makes suggestions for how organizational scientists can more comprehensively evaluate the spread of innovations. In later editions of Diffusion of Innovation, Rogers changes his terminology of the five stages to: knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{efficiency}} gap between {{foreign and domestic}} firms and its implication for technology spillover has found that although foreign firms are generally found to be <b>technically</b> more <b>efficient</b> the evidence on technology spillover is less conclusive in developing countries. This {{could be due to}} the fact that foreign firms, whose parent companies are in the developed countries, are using a technology which may not be appropriate for the domestic firms. We examine this inappropriate technology hypothesis by estimating measures of allocative efficiency for both domestic and foreign firms in eleven 3 -digit manufacturing industries of India during 1990 - 2000. We use stochastic frontier (econometric approach) as well as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA, linear programming) to measure efficiency of the firms. Assuming a Cobb-Douglas technology, we have estimated Stochastic Production Frontier and Stochastic Cost Frontier in each industry to measure technical efficiency and cost efficiency of each firm and get some inference on allocative efficiency. Using DEA we decompose total cost efficiency into technical and allocative efficiency. Our results indicate that generally foreign firms are <b>technically</b> more <b>efficient</b> but there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that these foreign firms are allocatively inefficient compared to the domestic firms...|$|R

Moreover, elimination of these inefficiencies could result in considerable gains; the cotton farmers examined could reduce production costs by 46. 0 %, by becoming both <b>technically</b> and scale <b>efficient.</b> Additionally, we estimate that if cotton farms in the area examined were <b>technically</b> and scale <b>efficient</b> the intervention price reductions (co-responsibility levy) imposed by the EU for excessive cotton production would be smaller for all Greek cotton growers. ...|$|R

Weber enumerated a number of principles of bureaucratic organization including: a formal organizational hierarchy, management by rules, organization by functional specialty, selecting people based on their skills and technical qualifications, an [...] "up-focused" [...] (to organization's board or shareholders) or [...] "in-focused" [...] (to the organization itself) mission, and a purposefully impersonal environment (e.g., applying the same rules and structures to {{all members of the}} organization). These rules reflect Weberian [...] "ideal types," [...] and how they are enacted in organizations varies according to local conditions. Charles Perrow extended Weber's work, arguing that all organizations can be understood in terms of bureaucracy and that organizational failures are more often a result of insufficient application of bureaucratic principles.|$|E
50|$|An ideal cost curve assumes {{technical}} efficiency, since a firm {{always has}} {{an incentive to}} be as <b>technically</b> <b>efficient</b> as possible. In general, firms {{have a variety of}} methods of using various amounts of inputs, and they select the lowest total cost method for any given amount of output (quantity produced). For example, if you wanted to make a few pins, the cheapest way to accomplish this might be by hiring one jack-of-all-trades and buying a scrap of metal and having him work on it in your home. But if you wished to produce thousands of pins, the lowest total cost might be achieved by renting a factory, buying specialized equipment and hiring an assembly line of factory workers to perform specialized actions at each stage of producing the pin. In the short run, you might not have time to rent a factory, or buy specialized tools, or hire factory workers. Then you would be able to achieve short run minimum costs, but you know the long run costs would be much less. The increase in choices available of how to produce in the long run means that long run costs are always equal to or less than the short run costs, ceteris paribus.|$|E

Subsequently, negotiations between Iran and three European states started at Saadabad in Tehran and continued in later months in Brussels, Geneva and Paris.Rouhani and his team, whose members had been introduced by Velayati and Kharazi as the best diplomats in the Iranian Foreign Ministry, based their efforts on dialogue and confidence building due to political and security conditions. As a first step, they prevented further escalation of accusations against Iran in order to prevent reporting Iran's nuclear case to the United Nations Security Council. Therefore, and for the purpose of confidence building, certain parts of Iran's nuclear activities were voluntarily suspended at several junctures.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate how data envelopment analysis (DEA) and production function analysis are combined to evaluate the input usage decisions of technically inefficient maize producers and to estimate potential yield gains from reallocating inputs. The data for this research originates from a production cost survey. Two distinct quadratic production functions were estimated for DEA-determined <b>technically</b> <b>efficient</b> and inefficient farmers using a dummy variable approach. Results indicate that the yield gains are large if farmers are able to produce in a <b>technically</b> <b>efficient</b> manner while maintaining current input levels. Results further indicate that even though a producer may be technically inefficient, yield gains and therefore increased profits are possible if such farmers adjust nitrogen application rates. The conclusion is that failure to recognise the fact that DEA-determined <b>technically</b> <b>efficient</b> and inefficient producers ’ production processes are characterised by two distinct production functions renders uniform input recommendations inappropriate.

This study employs the stochastic frontier production function methodology for panel data to measure the technical efficiency (TE) of coal-based thermal power plants in India during 1994 - 1995 to 2001 - 2002. Efficiency varies widely across plants and regions, while the TE is time-invariant. The average TE is approximately 73 %, indicating a substantial scope for increasing thermal power generation in the country, with improved application of existing technology and without employment of additional resources.

40|$|For {{estimating}} the relative efficiency of banks, income statement data {{as well as}} balance sheet data are used. Monthly balance sheet data are readily available from the DI 900 reports published {{by the department of}} Bank Supervision on the web site of the South African Reserve Bank. Monthly income statement data, on the other hand, are not readily available as banks regard it as confidential. Because of the unavailability of monthly income statement data, only monthly balance sheet data were used to estimate the relative efficiency of the four largest banks in South Africa. These four banks handle about 85. 17 % (March 2005) of the banking business in South Africa. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is applied to estimate the monthly technical and scale efficiency for the four banks over a period of 36 months. DEA is used because it lends itself more easily to the analysis of multiple-output firms. Bank B appears to be the most <b>technically</b> <b>efficient</b> bank. For fifteen months during the sample period the bank could be regarded as fully <b>technically</b> <b>efficient.</b> However this bank operated mainly in the region of increasing return to scale, implying that it was operating at a scale that is too small.
