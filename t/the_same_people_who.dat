5|$|With these changes, {{a special}} session of the {{legislature}} met August 5 until August 20 in Oregon City. On August 11, 1845 at the introduction of Jesse Applegate the body passed a law against dueling within a half hour that Governor Abernethy also signed within 30 minutes of the bill's introduction. A new legislature met beginning on December 2, with Robert Newell serving as {{the speaker of the}} body through December 10 and Henry A. G. Lee assuming the post until the conclusion of the session on December 19. Polk District was created during the session, with the bill passed on December 19. John E. Long served as the recorder and Theophilus R. Magruder as the sergeant at arms for the group. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> served in the summer session also served in the December session.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2000 former Serbian President Ivan Stambolić was kidnapped; his {{body was found in}} 2003 and Milošević was charged with {{ordering}} his murder. In 2005, several members of the Serbian secret police and criminal gangs were convicted in Belgrade for a number of murders, including Stambolić's. These were <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> arrested Milošević in April 2001. Later, Interior Minister Dušan Mihajlović denied that Milošević had been involved in Stambolić's death at Fruška Gora.|$|E
25|$|During Reconstruction, Congress enacted race-conscious {{programs}} {{primarily to}} assist newly freed slaves who had personally been denied many advantages earlier in their lives. Such legislation was enacted {{by many of}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> framed the Equal Protection Clause, though that clause {{did not apply to}} such federal legislation, and instead only applied to state legislation. Likewise, the Equal Protection Clause does not apply to private universities and other private businesses, which are free to practice affirmative action unless prohibited by federal statute or state law.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the success}} of the movie of Fight Club, {{interest}} began to build about adapting Survivor to film. The film rights to Survivor were sold in early 2001, but no movie studio had committed to filming the novel. After the attacks on The Pentagon and World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, movie studios apparently deemed the novel too controversial to film because it includes the hijacking and crashing of a civilian airplane. In mid-2004, however, 20th Century Fox committed to adapting Palahniuk's novel. Palahniuk has said that <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> made the film Constantine will be working on this film.|$|E
25|$|Paul's dreams, visualized by Brenna in 1780s, materialized in Saint Michael's Castle – the emperor's {{principal}} Saint Petersburg residence {{intended to}} replace the Winter Palace associated with Catherine's reign. The site chosen for the castle was highly significant to Paul: it housed the wooden Summer Palace of empress Elisabeth, it was Paul's birthplace, but also a place where his dreaded mother was proclaimed empress by <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> killed his father. Paul {{said that he had}} a vision of Archangel Michael who instructed him to erect a church on his birthplace, and indeed the castle designed by Brenna had a prominent church integrated in its western facade. Authorized immediately after Catherine's death, the castle was completed by Brenna in four years and occupied by the royal family shortly before Paul's own death. It had a strong Baroque styling clearly contrary to Catherinian palladianism.|$|E
500|$|David John, who {{had also}} worked on {{expansion}} packs for the original Neverwinter Nights, composed the score for Mysteries of Westgate, which took several months. In an interview soon after the game's release, Scull said [...] "Some of [...] tracks are so good, I actually listen to them alongside my usual eclectic mix." [...] Mysteries of Westgate's voice acting was recorded in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, with over 12,000 words of new voice-over material. [...] The cast included some of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> previously acted in [...] and other BioWare games.

500|$|Along with Weinstein, Oakley was {{to serve}} as an {{executive}} producer on the Fox television series Sit Down, Shut Up in 2009. Oakley ended his involvement with the show due to a contract dispute between the staff and Sony Pictures. Sony refused to offer a contract which operated under the complete terms of the Writers Guild of America. Weinstein continued working on the show. His two subsequent projects have been without Weinstein. In late 2009, NBC commissioned a pilot for Oakley's sitcom about [...] "the youngest judge in a circuit courthouse." [...] He wrote the 2010 episode of The Cleveland Show [...] "Gone with the Wind". Amongst other projects, Oakley planned a live-action show where the characters are all robots, which would be made by <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> produce the children's show Yo Gabba Gabba!.|$|E
500|$|While {{speaking}} of the Serbsky Center, Yuri Savenko alleges that [...] "practically nothing has changed. They have no shame at the institute about their role with the Communists. They are the same people, {{and they do not}} want to apologize for all their actions in the past." [...] Attorney Karen Nersisyan agrees: [...] "Serbsky is not an organ of medicine. It's an organ of power." [...] According to human rights activist and former psychiatrist Sofia Dorinskaya, the system of Soviet psychiatry has not been destroyed, the Serbsky Institute is standing where it did, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> worked in the Soviet system are working there. She says we have a situation like after the defeat of fascism in Germany, when fascism officially collapsed, but all governors of acres, judges and all people remained after the fascist regime.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} {{on the special}} {{was similar to that}} of the other episodes, with the hospital scenes being shot in the usual locations (the Northwick Park Hospital in Middlesex and the North Hampshire Hospital in Basingstoke). The script was written by the usual eight-person team led by Victoria Pile, and produced and directed by <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> recorded all the previous episodes. The special was recorded at the same time as the second series. The exterior scenes were harder to shoot. In the beginning funeral scene, one of the mourners is Alan Yentob, who had been filming an episode of the BBC One documentary series Imagine. Stephen Mangan said that Martin's mime during the funeral was one of his favourite moments in Green Wing. The opening titles of the episode differ from the others as it does not use the normal theme tune, [...] "Last Week", (as it is named in the [...] ) and instead uses the track, [...] "Camel".|$|E
5000|$|The Marquis St. Evrémonde is {{referred}} to as [...] "Monseigneur" [...] and [...] "Monsieur."

5000|$|Kondratyev {{not only}} denied accusations {{that he was}} ever {{personally}} engaged in Soviet abuses of psychiatry; he stated publicly that {{the very concept of}} Soviet-era [...] "punitive psychiatry" [...] was nothing more than: [...] "the fantasy vymysel of <b>the</b> very <b>same</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are now defending totalitarian sects. This is slander, which was previously used for anti-Soviet ends, but is now being used for anti-Russian ends." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2014, Cruz {{spoke at}} an event held by the group In Defense of Christians (IDC). He was booed by the group after making {{statements}} considered pro-Israel. Cruz left the stage after telling the audience, [...] "Those who hate Israel hate America. Those who hate Jews hate Christians. If those in this room will not recognize that, then my heart weeps. If you hate the Jewish people you are not reflecting the teachings of Christ. And <b>the</b> very <b>same</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> persecute and murder Christians right now, who crucify Christians, who behead children, are <b>the</b> very <b>same</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> target Jews for their faith, for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> reason". Some commentators {{believe there is a}} divide in the conservative movement between those who sided with Cruz and Israel, and those who sided with Middle Eastern Christians and some arguing that Cruz's comments were out-of-bounds. [...] Others who criticized Cruz included Mollie Hemingway and Ross Douthat. [...] Cruz apologized for questioning the motives of his critics and said that all should be united in speaking out against persecution of religious minorities.|$|R
500|$|Conversely, {{in recent}} times Cosby's {{controversial}} history with women has caused some contemporary critics to question his intentions behind creating a character like Clair {{in the wake of}} a series of sexual assault allegations made against the comedian. In 2014, The Crunk Feminist Collective famously published an article entitled [...] "Clair Huxtable is Dead: On Slaying the Cosbys" [...] in which the author dismissed the character's progressive gender politics as [...] "a sham", arguing that Clair must forgotten to allow for a new generation of television heroines. Nico Lang of The Daily Dot defended the character against such critics, writing that the show's legacy remains significant [...] "to the Clair Huxtables of the world, both the real women she inspired and a generation of characters who owe a debt to her." [...] Writing for Paste, in 2014 Shannon M. Houston maintains that Clair remains beloved as a [...] "feminist hero" [...] by <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> now try to disassociate themselves from both Cosby and The Cosby Show. Kirthana Ramisetti of the New York Daily News agreed that Cosby [...] "can’t detract from Clair’s enduring legacy." [...] John Teti, contributing to The A. V. Club, agreed that [...] "Clair Huxtable’s legacy remains intact" [...] despite [...] "the snowballing disgrace of its star has made The Cosby Show less of a wholesome memory than it once was".|$|E

25|$|The {{official}} theory also ignored some historical sources, {{like the}} account of Constantine VII, and considered that the Croats and Serbs were <b>the</b> <b>same</b> Slavic <b>people</b> <b>who</b> arrived in one and <b>the</b> <b>same</b> migration, and unwilling to consider foreign elements in those separate societies. There were Yugoslavian scholars like Ferdo Šišić and Nada Klaić who allowed limited non-Slavic origin of certain elements in Croatian ethnogenesis, and they were usually connected with the Avars and Bulgars.|$|R
2500|$|Strong {{emphasis}} {{on the importance of}} personal contact in organizing. Union officials are, according to Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon, [...] "paid," [...] as opposed to being volunteers from the union itself. These are <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> <b>who,</b> had they been employing the service model in their union, would have been offering services to the members, but instead they focus their efforts on organizing the union members to act on their own behalf, rather than simply offering them services.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} film's premiere, Cameron and video editor Ed Marsh created a longer video cut of The Abyss {{for their own}} use that {{incorporated}} dailies. With the tremendous success of Cameron's [...] in 1991, Lightstorm Entertainment secured a five-year, $500 million financing deal with 20th Century Fox for films produced, directed or written by Cameron. The contract allocated roughly $500,000 of the amount to complete The Abyss.

2500|$|... – The attack {{has been}} {{condemned}} by the Pakistani president, Asif Ali Zardari, and prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gillani. Governor Salmaan Taseer stated that <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> executed the 2008 Mumbai attacks {{were responsible for}} this attack. Following the attack Pakistan's interior minister Rehman Malik declared that Pakistan is [...] "in a state of war". Pakistani officials were also quick to blame one of its neighbours, India, of covert involvement, citing long standing enmity between the two South Asian countries. These claims were largely seen as an exercise in diverting {{attention away from the}} crisis.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that a person’s {{relative}} income – compared to a reference group – has a negative impact on self-reported happiness. This suggests that <b>people</b> <b>who</b> aim at increasing their happiness should try to find a better-paid job if their relative income is low. In this paper we study this hypothesis by estimating the effect of relative income on job mobility, using a dataset containing information on roughly four million Dutch employees. We consider three different reference groups: <b>people</b> <b>who</b> live in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> neighborhood, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> work for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> employer, and <b>people</b> <b>who</b> share certain demographic characteristics. Our findings suggest that workers compare their own income to that of their neighbors, and low relative income is associated with higher job mobility. We conclude that low relative income (compared to the neighbors) reduces workers’ happiness, and workers react to this by finding a new job which may offer the prospect of higher pay. ...|$|R

2500|$|Gladstone {{wanted to}} {{maintain}} a balance between direct and indirect taxation and to abolish income tax. He knew that its abolition depended on a considerable retrenchment in government expenditure. He therefore {{increased the number of}} people eligible to pay it by lowering the threshold from £150 to £100. The more people that paid income tax, Gladstone believed, the more the public would pressure the government into abolishing it. Gladstone argued that the £100 line was [...] "the dividing line ... between the educated and the labouring part of the community" [...] and that therefore the income tax payers and the electorate were to be <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> would then vote to cut government expenditure.|$|E

[...] Unfortunately, the very educators who want these children to challenge themselves and to embrace their gifts and talents are often <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are forced to discourage them in a mixed-ability classroom, through mechanisms like refusing to call on the talented student in class so that typical students have an opportunity to participate.|$|E
