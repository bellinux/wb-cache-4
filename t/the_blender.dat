5|$|Using {{a program}} called Blendanal, similar to <b>the</b> <b>Blender</b> {{technique}} used to verify the planets discovered by Kepler, the astronomers observing HAT-P-33 hoped to rule out false positive alternatives that could explain the planet-like signal seen in HAT-P-33's light curve and radial velocity. The use of Blendanal ruled out the possibilities that the signal was caused by that of a hierarchical triple star or a mixture between a bright star and a binary star in the background. The possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star whose secondary companion is too dim to be distinguishable from the brighter star could not be ruled out. However, the data indicated that the planet HAT-P-33b did indeed exist.|$|E
5|$|With {{a greater}} degree of {{certainty}} established, the Kepler team compared the models formed using Blender to the photometric observations collected by the Kepler satellite. <b>The</b> <b>Blender</b> technique allowed the Kepler team to rule out the majority of the alternatives including, notably, that of triple star systems. Blender then allowed the Kepler team to determine that although all models representing hierarchical triple stars (a binary system between a single star and a double star) can resemble the light curve of Kepler-10, the aforementioned follow-up observations would have detected them all. The only possible blends remaining after ruling out hierarchical triple stars was that of determining if the curve is caused by interference from a background star, or if it is indeed caused by the orbit of a transiting planet.|$|E
25|$|A blender is an upright, {{stationary}} kitchen appliance used to mix {{alcoholic beverages}} and puree food. Blenders {{are also used}} to prepare emulsions, such as mayonnaise, and cream soups. In 1919, Polish-American Stephen J. Poplawski of Racine, Wisconsin invented, designed, and manufactured beverage mixers used in preparation for malted milk served at soda fountains. It consisted of a spinning blade on a long rod extending down into a cup. Poplawski patented his invention of <b>the</b> <b>blender</b> in 1922.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Blenders</b> {{spent their}} early years, {{beginning}} in the '90s, touring hundreds {{of colleges and universities}} across <b>the</b> country. <b>The</b> <b>Blenders</b> found international success with a number one hit in a handful of European countries with a remake of Dean Friedman's quirky song, [...] "(I am in Love With the) McDonald's Girl." [...] Although their influences stretch far and wide, <b>The</b> <b>Blenders</b> find a common bond in vocal music - from R&B and Jazz, to Pop and Rock, their focus is on tight unmistakable, smooth vocal harmonies. In 1994 and 1995, <b>The</b> <b>Blenders</b> received <b>the</b> Contemporary Artist of the Year award by the National Association for Campus Activities. They have been cited as a strong influence by many of the vocal groups that formed in the 90's and are garnering attention today.|$|R

25|$|Blended whisky is {{made from}} a mixture of {{different}} types of whisky. A blend may contain whisky from many distilleries so that <b>the</b> <b>blender</b> can produce a flavour consistent with the brand. The brand name may, therefore, omit the name of a distillery. Most Scotch, Irish and Canadian whisky is sold as part of a blend, even when the spirits are the product of one distillery, as is common in Canada. American blended whisky may contain neutral spirits.|$|E
25|$|Single {{malt whisky}} is whisky {{from a single}} {{distillery}} made from a mash that uses only one particular malted grain. Unless the whisky is described as single-cask, it contains whisky from many casks, and different years, so <b>the</b> <b>blender</b> can achieve a taste recognisable as typical of the distillery. In most cases, single malts bear {{the name of the}} distillery, with an age statement and perhaps some indication of some special treatments such as maturation in a port wine cask.|$|E

500|$|George Smith died in 1871 {{and his son}} John Gordon Smith {{inherited}} the distillery. The quality of the product from their distillery had resulted in the other distilleries in the area renaming their products to [...] "Glenlivet" [...] {{and by the time}} of George's death, several distillers were doing so. J.G. Smith decided to take legal action and tried to claim ownership on The Glenlivet name, this legal action was only partially successful - the verdict forced other distillers in the area to stop calling their whisky Glenlivet and gave J.G. Smith and <b>the</b> <b>blender</b> Andrew Usher sole permission to use the brand, but permitted other distilleries to hyphenate their distillery name with the [...] "Glenlivet" [...] name, which resulted in new distillery names such as The Glen Moray-Glenlivet Distillery, a distillery which is situated nearby.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Ripley {{announced}} {{that she would be}} writing a cookbook about family food.

[...] Fay's Family Food was published by Michael Joseph, an imprint of Penguin Books, in April 2009 and was selected by Marie-Claire Digby of The Irish Times as a [...] "summer read". Ripley's second book, entitled What's For Dinner, was published in April 2012. Since the release of her first book, she has resisted offers from television production companies to make her own cookery series. In November 2016, Ripley guest presented an episode of The One Show with Alex Jones. She guest presented an episode with Angela Scanlon in January 2017.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} positive reception from critics. In <b>the</b> <b>Blender</b> magazine {{review of}} the album, critic Andy Greenwald, wrote: [...] "The title track , bursting with buzzing distortion, builds into a satisfying anti-glitz rant." [...] Tom Beajour of Entertainment Weekly reported that the song [...] "crams all of the genre's essential tropes — distorted power chords, abrupt dynamic shifts, and singsong melodies — into {{three and a half}} minutes of radio-friendly fire." [...] Chris Saunders of MusicOMH noted that the song is laden with [...] "memorable hooks, quiet/loud dynamics and emotive lyrics which will no doubt cut through to many a disenchanted youth: 'They gave you the end but not the where to start / not how to build, how to tear it apart.'" [...] Saunders concluded that the song [...] "is as lively and rousing as most of their best tracks." [...] Sputnikmusic wrote: [...] "The adventure is only on the second track [...] and the guys of Yellowcard are just getting started. This is by far the best tune on the album." [...] Bart Gottula of The Clarion wrote: [...] "The album's single and title cut, 'Light's and Sounds', follows with an amazing performance by every band member. The song provides a quick, hard-hitting beat that brings back Yellowcard's hybrid punk and emo music that the band explored in its previous single, 'Way Away'." ...|$|E
