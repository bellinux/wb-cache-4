5|$|Weapon turrets were {{mounted at}} {{the nose and}} the middle of {{aircraft}} underbelly. The nose turret could rotate +/- 100° from the aircraft's centerline and could mount either a 40mm (1.57in) grenade launcher, or a 7.62mm (0.308in) minigun. <b>The</b> <b>belly</b> turret included a 30mm (1.18in) automatic cannon with 360° of rotation. Mechanical stops prevented <b>the</b> <b>belly</b> turret from aiming at {{any part of the}} helicopter.|$|E
5|$|A. c. woodwardi Mathews, 1912 – {{southwest}} and south-central Australia {{west of the}} Mount Lofty Ranges. This subspecies is a little smaller than the nominate subspecies and has shorter wings. Its plumage is similar though the yellow patch on <b>the</b> <b>belly</b> is more prominent.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{the snake}} is subcylindrical, and is taller than it is wide. It has an upper surface that is {{typically}} a shade of blueish gray, while <b>the</b> <b>belly</b> is yellowish, with wide ventral scales that stretch from a third to {{more than half of}} the width of the body. Black rings of about uniform width are present throughout the length of the snake, but the rings narrow or are interrupted at <b>the</b> <b>belly.</b> The midbody is covered with 21 to 25 longitudinal rows of imbricate (overlapping) dorsal scales. The tail of the snake is paddle-shaped and adapted to swimming.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{occipital}} <b>belly</b> originates on <b>the</b> lateral {{two-thirds of}} the superior nuchal line, and on the mastoid process of the temporal bone. Inserted into the galea aponeurotica, or epicranial aponeurosis, <b>the</b> occipital <b>belly</b> communicates with <b>the</b> frontal <b>belly</b> by an intermediate tendon. From the aponeurosis, <b>the</b> frontal <b>belly</b> is inserted in the fascia of the facial muscles and in the skin above the eyes and nose.|$|R

5|$|This bird is glossy {{black with}} a wide fork to the tail. Adults usually have a small white spot {{at the base of}} the gape. The iris is dark brown (not crimson as in the similar ashy drongo). The sexes cannot be told apart in the field. Juveniles are {{brownish}} and may have some white barring or speckling towards <b>the</b> <b>belly</b> and vent, and can be mistaken for the white-bellied drongo. First-year birds have white tips to the feathers of <b>the</b> <b>belly,</b> while second-years have these white-tipped feathers restricted to the vent.|$|E
5|$|A {{thin layer}} of horn is glued onto what will be <b>the</b> <b>belly</b> of the bow, the side facing the archer. Water buffalo horn is very suitable, as is horn of several antelopes such as gemsbok, oryx, ibex, and that of Hungarian grey cattle. Goat and sheep horn can also be used. Most forms of cow horn are not suitable, as they soon {{delaminate}} with use. The horn can store more energy than wood in compression.|$|E
5|$|ARCHER is {{a daytime}} {{non-invasive}} technology, which works by analyzing an object’s reflected light. It cannot detect objects at night, underwater, under dense cover, underground, under snow or inside buildings. The system uses a special camera facing down through a quartz glass portal in <b>the</b> <b>belly</b> of the aircraft, which is typically flown at a standard mission altitude of 2500feet (800meters) and 100 knots (50meters/second) ground speed.|$|E

5|$|According to Human Rights Watch, the abdomens {{of three}} {{pregnant}} women were cut {{open and the}} foetus removed and thrown into a fire. In an incident that came to light in 2007, Suresh Dedawala (Richard) alias Langado was caught on camera in a Tehelka sting operation talking to Bajarangi about slitting <b>the</b> <b>belly</b> of pregnant Muslim Kausar Banu, removing her foetus and killing it with a sword.|$|E
5|$|Dogs {{were tied}} with strings around <b>the</b> <b>belly</b> {{and kept in}} the house where they were raised as a food source {{alongside}} domesticated pigs. Seen as a delicacy, they were served during feasts and to the high chiefs. Dogs were less abundant than pigs in the islands, possibly because they were killed while they were young. European visitors noticed the native women, especially those who lost their own children, would often breastfeed puppies and small pigs.|$|E
5|$|Immature red wattlebirds are {{generally}} less flamboyant. Juveniles have much less prominent wattles, brown irises, a pale crown {{and much less}} yellow on <b>the</b> <b>belly.</b> They moult into first immature plumage {{within a few months}} of leaving the nest. First immature birds are more similar to adults overall, having red irises with brown rings, wattles larger but still smaller than adults, and a greyish pink gape.|$|E
50|$|The occipitofrontalis muscle {{receives}} {{blood from}} several arteries. <b>The</b> frontal <b>belly</b> receives {{blood from the}} supraorbital and supratrochlear arteries, while <b>the</b> occipital <b>belly</b> receives blood from the occipital artery.The occipitofrontalis muscle is innervated by the facial nerve.|$|R
50|$|The {{females and}} juveniles of all {{subspecies}} of P. intermedius have black scales, with white stripes on their backs. <b>The</b> <b>bellies</b> are brown, but the outer edges are white. Adult males have different colorations for each subspecies.|$|R
5000|$|Marinus van Dam, product {{developer}} and plant {{manager for the}} company, oversaw the development of Jelly Belly jelly beans. By the 1980s, many flavors had been developed.

5|$|Juvenile {{birds of}} both sexes have less {{extensive}} blue on their faces, the coloration not extending past the eye. The upperparts resemble those of the adult female. Both sexes have the white wing-stripe, which disappears with maturity in males. The immature male has a red patch on the wing and may also have an orange wash on <b>the</b> <b>belly.</b>|$|E
5|$|More specifically, the {{nominate}} subspecies has a grey forehead, crown, nape, ear-coverts {{and throat}} {{with the face}} a darker grey-black. The feathers of the throat are longer, giving rise to hackles there. The upperparts and underparts are a brownish-grey and become more brown with age. Towards <b>the</b> <b>belly,</b> the feathers are a paler grey. The wings are grey-brown, and the blackish primaries have white edges which merge to form the prominent white wing markings.|$|E
5|$|Other less {{satisfactory}} materials than horn {{have been}} used for <b>the</b> <b>belly</b> of the bow (the part facing the archer when shooting), including bone, antler, or compression-resistant woods such as osage orange, hornbeam, or yew. Materials that are strong under tension, such as silk, or tough wood, like hickory, {{have been used}} {{on the back of the}} bow (the part facing away from the archer when shooting).|$|E

5|$|Studies by Phil Senter in 2007 {{conducted}} on P. neimongoliensis and P. mongoliensis {{concluded that the}} forelimbs of these taxa (and likely those of other Psittacosaurus species) were too short (only about 58% {{as long as the}} hindlimbs) to reach the ground, and their range of motion indicates they could neither be pronated nor generate propulsive force for locomotion, suggesting that Psittacosaurus was entirely bipedal. The forelimbs were also too short to be used in digging or bringing food to the mouth, and Senter suggested that if Psittacosaurus needed to dig depressions in the ground it may have used its hindlimbs instead. The forelimbs could be used for two-handed grasping of objects or scratching the body, but due to their extremely limited flexibility and reach, they could have only been used to grasp objects very close to <b>the</b> <b>belly</b> or sides of the animal and could have scratched only <b>the</b> <b>belly,</b> flank and knees. Even though the hands could not reach the mouth, Psittacosaurus could have still used them to carry nesting material or food to a desired location.|$|E
5|$|The B-52C's fuel {{capacity}} (and range) was increased to 41,700USgallons by adding larger 3000USgallon underwing fuel tanks. The gross weight was increased by 30,000pounds (13,605kg) to 450,000pounds. A new fire control system, the MD-9, was introduced on this model. <b>The</b> <b>belly</b> {{of the aircraft}} was painted with antiflash white paint, which was intended to reflect thermal radiation away after a nuclear detonation.|$|E
5|$|The Qum-Darya bow was {{superseded}} in {{the modern}} area of Hungary by an 'Avar' type, with more and differently-shaped laths. The grip laths stayed essentially the same except that a fourth piece was sometimes glued {{to the back of}} the handle enclosing it with bone on all four faces. <b>The</b> <b>belly</b> lath was often parallel-sided with splayed ends. The siyah laths became much wider in profile above the nock and less rounded, giving a bulbous aspect. The nock was often further away from the upper end of the siyah than on Qum-Darya type examples. Additional laths were usually added to <b>the</b> <b>belly</b> and back of the siyah thus enclosing both ends of the stave on four faces. This made a total of up to 12 laths on an asymmetrical bow with stiff, set back handle. Examples measured in situ suggest bow lengths of 120–140cm. When unstrung the siyahs reversed sharply forward at an angle of 50-60 degrees.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{anterior}} <b>belly</b> of <b>the</b> digastric muscle varies {{greatly in}} shape and size. In this report, two cases of anomalies in the digastric muscle found in necropsy material belonging to the Institute of Anatomy are described. In the first case, we found a bilateral anomaly – a lateral widening of <b>the</b> muscle <b>belly</b> as an adaptation; this was shown by separation of <b>the</b> anterior muscle <b>belly</b> of digastric muscle into a medial and lateral head. The latter of which passing through the intermediate tendon and fixing partially on the hyoid bone. In the second case, a bilateral asymmetrical anomaly of <b>the</b> anterior <b>belly</b> was described. This involved the separation of <b>the</b> anterior <b>belly</b> into medial and lateral parts and the occurrence of accessory bundles; these bundles run from the left part of the mandible to the intermediate tendon of {{the right side of}} digastric muscle and to the hyoid bone...|$|R
50|$|The occipitofrontalis muscle (epicranius muscle) is {{a muscle}} which covers {{parts of the}} skull. It {{consists}} of two parts or bellies: <b>The</b> occipital <b>belly,</b> near <b>the</b> occipital bone, and <b>the</b> frontal <b>belly,</b> near <b>the</b> frontal bone. In humans, the occipitofrontalis only serves for facial expressions.|$|R
5|$|The back of {{the fish}} is {{iridescent}} and blue-green in color, with many yellow and gold spots. <b>The</b> <b>belly</b> is white.

Their pectoral fins are a light tone of sepia, and {{the margin of the}} anal fin is a purplish-blue color.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of the}} long-toed {{salamander}} is dusky black with a dorsal stripe of tan, yellow, or olive-green. This stripe can also be broken up {{into a series of}} spots. The sides of the body can have fine white or pale blue flecks. <b>The</b> <b>belly</b> is dark-brown or sooty in color with white flecks. Root tubercles are present, but they are not quite as developed as other species, such as the tiger salamander.|$|E
5|$|The breed is {{described}} as swimming and diving {{as well as the}} ducks themselves; and they are intelligent enough to avoid being lured away from the nesting places.
