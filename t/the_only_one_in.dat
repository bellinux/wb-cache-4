More controversially he maintained that it was unlikely that other stars in the galaxy could have planets with the necessary properties (the existence of other galaxies not having been proved at the time).|$|E

5|$|As a child, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana {{was sent}} {{to live in a}} village that his father named Ambohimanga. As a young man, his father granted him the region of Avaradrano {{surrounding}} the village, and while his father still lived he managed the daily affairs of state in Avaradrano without taking the title of king. He declared Ambohimanga the capital of the region, building numerous structures on the site and adding its first set of defensive walls, ditches and gates. The site's historic and cultural significance was recognized in 2001 when UNESCO declared it a World Heritage Site, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the cultural category in Madagascar.

5|$|As {{the storm}} {{crossed over the}} Florida panhandle and southeastern Georgia, the winds {{weakened}} to , although it still produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds in Savannah, Georgia.

Several ships reported strong winds and rough seas. On October6, the storm restrengthened to its peak intensity before becoming an extratropical cyclone about 200mi (320km) southeast of Cape Cod; however, one meteorologist assessed it as acquiring extratropical characteristics after it exited Georgia into the western Atlantic. As an extratropical storm, it reached winds of 80mph (130km/h), based on a ship report south of Atlantic Canada. Late on October7, the storm was last observed to the south of Newfoundland. The storm was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the season not to attain hurricane status.|$|E
