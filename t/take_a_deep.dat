25|$|I {{never did}} {{know exactly what}} was meant by the term 'The Beats', but let's say that the {{original}} meeting, association, comradeship of Allen , myself, Michael , Lawrence , Philip Whalen, who's not here, Lew Welch, who's dead, Gregory , for me, to a somewhat lesser extent (I never knew Gregory {{as well as the}} others) did embody a criticism and a vision which we shared in various ways, and then went our own ways for many years. Where we began to come really close together again, in the late '60s, and gradually working toward this point, it seems to me, was when Allen began to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in Oriental thought and then in Buddhism which added another dimension to our levels of agreement; and later through Allen's influence, Lawrence began to draw toward that; and from another angle, Michael and I after the lapse of some years of contact, found our heads very much in the same place, and it's very curious and interesting now; and Lawrence went off in a very political direction for a while, which none of us had any objection with, except that wasn't my main focus. It's very interesting that we find ourselves so much on the same ground again, after having explored divergent paths; and find ourselves united on this position of powerful environmental concern, critique of the future of the individual state, and an essentially shared poetics, and only half-stated but in the background very powerfully there, a basic agreement on some Buddhist type psychological views of human nature and human possibilities.|$|E

Romney's television advertisements {{in the early}} primary states prominently featured her [...] and by the close of 2007, {{she was the most}} visible of all the Republican candidates' wives in campaigning. [...] Regarding having to witness criticism of her husband, she later acknowledged that she sometimes wanted to [...] "come out of my seat and clock somebody [...] you learn to just <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath." [...] By the time he ended his campaign in February 2008, she had become openly distasteful of the whole process.|$|E

2500|$|The {{shortness}} of breath is often described by PPCM patients as the inability to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> or full breath or to get enough air into the lungs. [...] Also, patients often describe the need to prop themselves up overnight by using two or more pillows in order to breathe better. [...] These symptoms, swelling, and/or cough may be indications of pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs) resulting from acute heart failure and PPCM.|$|E

[...] "I have never met President Gee, {{but it is clear}} from what I read that what he said was made in jest. Was it dumb? ... yes. But context and tone matter, as does the frequency of what may be considered an offensive remark: a real bigot is someone who repeatedly, and maliciously, attacks others. Gee is not such a man. Political correctness has gone too far." ...|$|E

6000|$|Possibly, in some sense, Clifford {{may have}} been right.

60|$|Anderson {{paused to}} <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath. Then {{he began to}} curse Neuman.

Every vile name that had ever been used by cowboy, outlaw, gambler, leaped to Anderson's stinging tongue. All the keen, hard epithets common to the modern day he flung into Neuman's face. And he ended with a profanity that was as individual in character as its delivery was intense.|$|E
