50|$|The {{distinction}} between Stanislavski's 'experiencing the role' and Coquelin's 'representing the part' {{turns on the}} relationship that <b>the</b> <b>actor</b> establishes with their character during the performance.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>actors</b> {{began working}} on the game in 2010. Their {{performances}} were mostly recorded using motion capture technology.

40|$|Two {{components}} of lay observers’ calculus of moral judgment are proximal intent (<b>the</b> <b>actor’s</b> mind {{is focused on}} performing the action) and distal intent (<b>the</b> <b>actor’s</b> mind {{is focused on the}} broader goal). What causes observers to prioritize one form of intent over the other? The authors observed whether construal level (Studies 1 - 2) and beliefs about free will (Studies 3 - 4) would influence participants’ sensitivity to <b>the</b> <b>actor’s</b> proximal versus distal intent. In four studies, participants read scenarios in which <b>the</b> <b>actor’s</b> proximal and distal intent were independently manipulated. In Study 1, when only distal intent was present in <b>the</b> <b>actor’s</b> mind, participants rated <b>the</b> psychologically distant <b>actor</b> more responsible than <b>the</b> psychologically near <b>actor.</b> In Study 2, when only distal intent was in <b>the</b> <b>actor’s</b> mind, participants with a chronic high level of action identification rated <b>the</b> <b>actor</b> more responsible than did those with a low level of action identification. In both studies, when only proximal intent was in <b>the</b> <b>actor’s</b> mind, construal level did not predict judgments of responsibility. In Study 3, when only proximal intent was present in <b>the</b> <b>actor’s</b> mind, <b>the</b> more participants believed in free will, the more they rated <b>the</b> <b>actor</b> responsible. When only distal intent was in <b>the</b> <b>actor’s</b> mind, free will belief did not influence ratings of responsibility. In Study 4, the same pattern emerged when free will / determinism beliefs were manipulated and <b>the</b> <b>actor</b> performed a positive (life-saving) act.

40|$|Employees often {{assess whether}} {{the social context}} is {{favorable}} for them to speak out, yet little research has investigated how the target's mood might influence <b>the</b> <b>actor's</b> voice behavior. From an affect-associal-information perspective, we explored such potential effects of the target's mood on <b>the</b> <b>actor's</b> promotive voice in 2 empirical studies. In a scenario-based study with 142 MBA students (Study 1), the target's positive mood was positively associated with <b>the</b> <b>actor's</b> intentions to engage in promotive voice toward that target, mediated by <b>the</b> <b>actor's</b> perceived psychological safety.

40|$|Encoding {{observed}} action {{according to}} its hierarchical, goal-subgoal structure {{makes it easier to}} learn, and leads learners to orient objects and actions from <b>the</b> <b>actor’s</b> spatial perspective. <b>The</b> present pair of studies tested whether adopting <b>the</b> <b>actor’s</b> perspective during encoding leads observers to encode actions more hierarchically.

50|$|When {{an actor}} commits a crime (primary deviance), however mild, the {{institution}} will bring social penalties down on <b>the</b> <b>actor.</b> However, punishment {{does not necessarily}} stop crime, so <b>the</b> <b>actor</b> might commit <b>the</b> same primary deviance again, bringing even harsher reactions from the institutions.
