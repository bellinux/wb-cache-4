40|$|Optimization of X-ray beam <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> (kVp) in {{radiological}} examinations can minimize patient dose. This research aims {{to investigate}} the effect of <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> variation on gonad doses to patients during posteroanterior (PA) chest radiography examinations. This study was carried out using a Toshiba general purpose X-ray unit and a Rando phantom. Dose measuring equipment included an ion chamber system, a dose-area product (DAP) meter and a thermoluminescent dosemeter (TLD) reader system with high sensitivity TLD pellets of LiF:Mg,Cu,P for low level gonad dose measurement. PA chest exposures of the phantom to produce a constant exit dose were made using a standard low <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> (range 60 - 100 kVp) non-grid technique and a high <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> (range 95 - 150 kVp) grid technique. Entrance surface doses (ESDs) and DAPs were {{also included in the}} measurements. Effective doses (EDs) were computed from ESD and DAP measurements using NRPB-SR 262 and Xdose software. Results show that with the low <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> technique both ovary dose and testes dose increase with increasing tube potential; statistically significant correlations of r= 0. 994 (p= 0. 0006) and r= 0. 998 (p= 0. 001), respectively, were found. For both organs, doses increase at a rate of approximately 2 % per kVp. With the high <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> technique there is insignificant correlation between gonad doses and <b>tube</b> <b>potential.</b> When comparing patient doses from typical exposures made at 70 kVp (low <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> non-grid technique) with doses from exposures made at 120 kVp (high <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> grid technique), the high <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> technique delivers significantly higher values for ESD, and ovary, testes and effective doses by factors of 1. 7, 5. 2, 5. 5 and 2. 7, respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} prospectively, {{in patients}} with testicular cancer, the radiation dose-saving potential and image quality of contrast-enhanced chest and abdominal CT with automated <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> selection. METHODS: Forty consecutive patients with testicular cancer underwent contrast-enhanced arterio-venous chest and portal-venous abdominal CT with automated <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> selection (protocol B; <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> 80 - 140  kVp), {{which is based on}} the attenuation of the CT topogram. All had a first CT at 120  kVp (protocol A) using the same 64 -section CT machine and similar settings. Image quality was assessed; dose information (CTDI(vol)) was noted. RESULTS: Image noise and attenuation in the liver and spleen were significantly higher for protocol B (P[*]<[*] 0. 05 each), whereas attenuation in the deltoid and erector spinae muscles was similar. In protocol B, <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> was reduced to 100  kVp in 18 chest and 33 abdominal examinations, and to 80  kVp in 5 abdominal CT examinations; it increased to 140  kVp in one patient. Image quality of examinations using both CT protocols was rated as diagnostic. CTDI(vol) was significantly lower for protocol B compared to protocol A (reduction by 12 %, P[*]<[*] 0. 01). CONCLUSION: In patients with testicular cancer, radiation dose of chest and abdominal CT can be reduced with automated <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> selection, while image quality is preserved...|$|E

Methods: A total of 110 (59 men, 51 women) patients underwent chest-abdomen-pelvis CT examinations; 55 using a fixed <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> of 120 kV/current of 210 Reference mAs (using CareDose 4 D), and 55 using automated attenuation-based <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> selection (CAREkV) also using a current of 210 Reference mAs.

40|$|PURPOSE:: To {{introduce}} a novel algorithm of automated attenuation-based <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> selection {{and to assess}} its impact on image quality and radiation dose of body computed tomography angiography (CTA). MATERIALS AND METHODS:: In all, 40 patients (mean age 71 ± 11. 8 years, body mass index (BMI) 25. 7 ± 3. 8 kg/m, range 18. 8 - 33. 8 kg/m) underwent 64 -slice thoracoabdominal CTA (contrast material: 80 mL, 5 mL/s) using an automated <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> selection algorithm (CAREkV), which optimizes tube-potential (70 - 140 kV) and tube-current (138. 8 ± 18. 6 effective mAs, range 106 - 177 mAs) based on the attenuation profile of the topogram and on the diagnostic task. Image quality was semiquantitatively assessed by 2 blinded and independent readers (scores 1 : excellent to 5 : nondiagnostic). Attenuation and noise were measured by another 2 blinded and independent readers. Contrast-to-noise ratio was calculated. The CT dose index (CTDIvol) was recorded and compared with the estimated CTDIvol of a standard 120 kV protocol without using the algorithm in each patient. Selected tube potentials were correlated with BMI and attenuation of the topogram. RESULTS:: Diagnostic image quality was obtained in all patients (excellent: 14; good: 21; moderate: 5; interreader agreement: κ = 0. 78). Mean attenuation, noise, and contrast-to-noise ratio were 260. 8 ± 63. 5 Hounsfield units, 15. 5 ± 3. 3 Hounsfield units, and 14 ± 4. 2, respectively, with good to excellent agreement between readers (r = 0. 50 - 0. 99, P < 0. 01 each). Automated attenuation-based <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> selection resulted in a kV-reduction from 120 to 100 kV in 23 patients and to 80 kV in 1 patient, whereas <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> increased to 140 kV in 1 patient. Automatically selected <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> showed a significant correlation with both BMI (r = 0. 427, P < 0. 05) and attenuation of the topogram (r = 0. 831, P < 0. 001). CTDIvol (7. 95 ± 2. 6 mGy) was significantly lower when using the algorithm compared with the standard 120 kV protocol (10. 59 ± 1. 8 mGy, P < 0. 001), corresponding to an overall dose reduction of 25. 1 %.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> on radiation dose and image quality of third-generation dual-source coronary CT angiography (CTA) in a phantom simulating an obese patient. A thoracic phantom was equipped with tubular inserts containing iodine solution and water. A soft-tissue-equivalent ring around the phantom simulated an obese patient. Images were acquired at tube potentials of 80, 100, 120 and 140 kV with second-generation dual-source CT (DSCT) and 70 - 150 kV (in 10 -kV increments) with third-generation DSCT. Contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was calculated and CT dose index was recorded. With second-generation DSCT, CNR was highest for 120 kV (19. 0) and decreased with lower <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> (12. 0 at 80 kV) owing to disproportionately increased image noise. With third-generation DSCT, 70 - and 80 -kV acquisitions showed a smaller increase in noise. CNRs for third-generation DSCT were highest for 70 and 80 kV (21. 1 and 21. 2, respectively). Compared to 120 kV, radiation dose was 68 % and 49 % lower at 70 kV and 80 kV, respectively. Third-generation DSCT enables one to perform coronary CTA at 70 - 80 kV in obese patients without compromising CNR and thus reduces radiation dose by 49 - 68 %. • Low <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> CT angiography is currently not suitable for obese patients. • Third-generation DSCT offers substantially increased tube power at low <b>tube</b> <b>potential.</b> • This enables one to perform coronary CT angiography at 70 - 80 kV in obese patients. • Signal-to-noise ratio is maintained owing to increased tube current. • This approach {{can be expected to}} reduce radiation dose by 49 - 68 %...|$|E

The lung, heart, and mediastinum regions were simulated by 10 mm x 10 mm x 0. 5 mm, 10 mm x 10 mm x 0. 5 mm and 10 mm x 10 mm x 1 mm copper plates, respectively. A test object of 100 mm x 100 mm and 0. 2 mm thick copper was positioned to each region for CNR measurements. The phantom was exposed to x-rays generated by different <b>tube</b> <b>potentials</b> that covered settings in clinical use: 110 - 120 kVp (HVL= 4. 26 - 4. 66 mm Al) at a source image distance (SID) of 180 cm.

During X-ray beam irradiation, the scintillating light and IR signals were measured simultaneously using a dosimeter probe of the FOD and a thermometer probe of the FOT. The probes were placed in a beaker with water {{on the center of}} a hotplate, under variation of the <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> of a digital radiography system or the temperature of the water in the beaker.

The numbers of perceptible holes in each experimental condition (TSs) were statistically analyzed through use of analysis of variance. Intraobserver and interobserver agree-ment was also measured. Results: Vistascan ex-hibited the most extended useful exposure range, followed by RVG 6000 and Insight. RVG 6000 exhibited the largest TS values in all <b>tube</b> <b>potential</b> settings except 70 kV where the Vistascan performed better. Insight performed better than Vistascan only at 60 and 63 kV.

For dose measurements, an Alderson-Rando phantom equipped with thermoluminescent dosimeters was used. The effective dose was calculated according to ICRP 103. Exposure {{was performed on}} a second-generation dual-source scanner (SOMATOM Definition Flash, Siemens Medical Solutions, Germany). The following scan parameters were used: 320 [*]mAs per rotation, 100 and 120 [*]kV, pitch 3. 4 for prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch CTCA, scan range of 13. 5 [*]cm, collimation 64 × 2 × 0. 6 [*]mm with z-flying focal spot, gantry rotation time 280 [*]ms, and simulated heart rate of 60 beats per minute. Results. Depending on the applied <b>tube</b> <b>potential,</b> the effective whole-body dose of the cardiac scan ranged from 1. 1 [*]mSv to 1. 6 [*]mSv and from 1. 2 to 1. 8 [*]mSv for males and females, respectively. The radiosensitive breast tissue {{in the range of}} the primary beam caused an increased female-specific effective dose of 8. 6 %± 0. 3 % compared to males. Decreasing the <b>tube</b> <b>potential,</b> a significant reduction of the effective dose of 35. 8 % and 36. 0 % can be achieved for males and females, respectively (< 0. 001). Conclusion. The radiologist and the CT technician should be aware of this new dose-saving strategy to keep the radiation exposure as low as reasonablly achievable...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} the benefits in image contrast enhancement using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) compared to conventional iodinated contrast media. Materials and methods: Gold nanoparticles and iodinated contrast media were evaluated for contrast enhancement at various X-ray <b>tube</b> <b>potentials</b> in an imaging phantom. Iopromide and AuNP suspension were equalized according to molar concentration of radiopaque element (0. 5077 Mol/L). Contrast-to-noise ratio {{is used to}} quantify contrast enhancement. Both projectional radiographic (40 - 80 kVp) and computed tomography (CT) (80 - 140 kVp) imaging modalities were examined. Results and conclusions: Findings indicate 89 % improvement in CNR at low energies near the mammographic range (40 kVp). However, as expected {{no significant difference in}} enhancement was observed at potentials commonly used for angiography (around 80 kVp) probably due to the k-edge influence for iodine. At the highest energies typically available in computed tomography, significant improvement in contrast enhancement using gold nanoparticles is obtained, 114 % greater CNR than that produced by iodine at 140 kVp. Experimental findings for 70 - 120 kVp spectra correlate well with the theoretical calculations based on linear attenuation coefficients. Superior attenuation of gold nanoparticles at low and high kVp potentials support their further (pre) clinical evaluation...|$|R
40|$|In this work, a Monte Carlo {{code was}} used to {{investigate}} the performance of different x-ray spectra in digital mammography, through a figure of merit (FOM), defined as FOM = CNR 2 /(D) over bar (g), with CNR being the contrast-to-noise ratio in image and (D) over bar (g) being the average glandular dose. The FOM was studied for breasts with different thicknesses t (2 cm = 6 cm, they also depend on breast glandularity. Particularly for thick and dense breasts, a W anode combined with K-edge filters can greatly improve the digital technique, with the values of FOM up to 200 % greater than that obtained with the anode/filter combinations and <b>tube</b> <b>potentials</b> traditionally employed in mammography. For breasts with t < 4 cm, a general good performance was obtained with the W anode combined with 60 mu m of the Mo filter at 24 - 25 kVp, while 60 mu m of the Pd filter provided a general good performance at 24 - 26 kVp for t = 4 cm, and at 28 - 30 and 29 - 31 kVp for t = 6 and 8 cm, respectively...|$|R
