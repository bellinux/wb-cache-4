5000|$|It {{is clear}} that Lord Steyn {{intended}} that a virtual or moral certainty test should necessarily lead to a finding of intention. But by phrasing the guidelines {{in terms of what}} <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>are</b> not entitled to do, the clarity of the direction is compromised. He may have felt that <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>are</b> entitled to indirectly infer but not directly find intention. It would have been better expressed as a positive; i.e. [...] "if <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>are</b> sure that <b>the</b> defendant foresaw death or grievous bodily harm as a virtual certainty this equals intention". Nevertheless, it seems that [...] "a result foreseen as virtually certain is an intended result",It is not clear that Lord Steyn intended the above meaning. Parliament required that <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> not <b>be</b> directed to find intention, and Lord Steyn cannot have intended to contravene Parliament's wishes. Where <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>are</b> sure that <b>the</b> defendant foresaw the required level of harm to be a virtual certainty this <b>is</b> evidence which <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> may consider in consideration of whether the defendant personally intended this harm.|$|R
5|$|Barton Fink premiered in May 1991 at the Cannes Film Festival. Beating {{competition}} {{which included}} Jacques Rivette's La Belle Noiseuse, Spike Lee's Jungle Fever, and David Mamet's Homicide, the Coen brothers' film won three awards: Best Director, Best Actor, {{and the top}} prize Palme d'Or. This sweep of awards in major categories at Cannes was extremely rare, and some critics felt <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>was</b> too generous {{to the exclusion of}} other worthy entries. Worried that the triple victory could set a precedent which would undervalue other films, Cannes decided after the 1991 festival to limit each movie to a maximum of two awards.|$|E
5|$|The {{court also}} ruled that {{evidence}} against Andrew Wilson, regarding other matters {{for which the}} police wanted him, was incorrectly admitted at his trial on murder charges. His case was remanded to the lower court for retrial. Andrew Wilson was convicted at his second trial in June 1988. But, after five days of deliberation, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>was</b> unable to agree on Wilson's eligibility for the death penalty; ten women {{were in favor of}} imposing this sentence and two men opposed it. The following month Andrew Wilson was sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|The prosecution's {{theory of}} the case, as told in its opening {{statement}} to <b>the</b> <b>jury,</b> <b>was</b> that Thornton, having failed {{in his attempt to}} seduce Ashford, lay in wait for her in the field near the pit. He knew she would have to cross the field on her return from Erdington. On perceiving him, she attempted to elude him, but he caught her and got her to accompany him into the next field. There, he threw her down and ravished her. The post-mortem showed that she had not eaten in 24hours, and according to the prosecuting counsel, she was unable to resist and fainted. Fearing the consequences were he to be caught with an unconscious woman whom he had treated in such a manner, Thornton threw her into the pit, where she drowned. At that time, defence counsel were not permitted to address the jury, and the matter proceeded with the prosecution case.|$|E

5|$|The {{use of a}} {{military}} tribunal provoked criticism from Edward Bates and Gideon Welles, who believed that a civil court should have presided; but Attorney General James Speed pointed to the military nature of the conspiracy and the facts that the defendants acted as enemy combatants and that martial law was in force {{at the time in}} the District of Columbia. (In 1866, in Ex parte Milligan, the United States Supreme Court banned the use of military tribunals in places where civil courts were operational.) Only a simple majority of <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>was</b> required for a guilty verdict, and a two-thirds for a death sentence. There was no route for appeal other than to President Johnson.|$|E
5|$|In post-trial analyses, {{blame for}} the outcome varied. Mamie Till Bradley was criticized for not crying enough on the stand. <b>The</b> <b>jury</b> <b>was</b> noted to have been picked almost {{exclusively}} from the hill country section of Tallahatchie County, which, due to its poorer economic make-up, found whites and blacks competing for land and other agrarian opportunities. Unlike the population living closer to the river (and thus closer to Bryant and Milam in Leflore County), who possessed a noblesse oblige toward blacks, according to historian Stephen Whitaker, those {{in the eastern part}} of the county were virulent in their racism. The prosecution was criticized for dismissing any potential juror who knew Milam or Bryant, for the fear that such a juror would vote to acquit. Afterward, Whitaker noted that this was a mistake, as anyone who had personally known the defendants usually disliked them. One juror voted twice to convict, but on the third discussion, acquiesced and voted with the rest of the jury to acquit. In later interviews, the jurors acknowledged that they knew Bryant and Milam were guilty, but simply did not believe that life imprisonment or the death penalty were fit punishment for whites who had killed a black man. But two jurors said as late as 2005 that they believed the defense's case. They said that the prosecution had not proved that Till had died, nor that it was his body that was removed from the river.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{was determined to}} give the soldiers a fair trial so {{there could be no}} grounds for retaliation from the British and so moderates would not be alienated from the Patriot cause. After several lawyers with Loyalist leanings refused to defend him, Preston sent a request to John Adams, pleading for him to work on the case. Adams, who was already a leading Patriot and who was contemplating a run for public office, agreed to help, in the interest of ensuring a fair trial. Adams was joined by Josiah Quincy II after the latter was assured that the Sons of Liberty would not oppose his appointment, and by Robert Auchmuty, a Loyalist. They were assisted by Sampson Salter Blowers, whose chief duty was to investigate the jury pool, and Paul Revere, who drew a detailed map of the bodies {{to be used in the}} trial of the British soldiers held responsible. Massachusetts Solicitor General Samuel Quincy and private attorney Robert Treat Paine, hired by the town of Boston, handled the prosecution. Preston was tried separately in late October 1770. He was acquitted after <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>was</b> convinced that he had not ordered the troops to fire.|$|E

5|$|The lawyers {{argued the}} case before the Appellate Division in Brooklyn on October 21, 1927. On December 9, the Appellate Division affirmed the trial court's judgment, 3–2. Albert H. F. Seeger wrote the {{majority}} opinion for the five justices hearing the case, and was joined by Justices William F. Hagarty and William B. Carswell. Seeger {{had been born in}} Stuttgart and came to the United States as a child; he had been elected to the Supreme Court in 1917 and was elevated to the Appellate Division by Governor Al Smith in 1926. Aged 68 at the time of Palsgraf, he could serve only two more years before mandatory retirement. Justice Seeger ruled that the finding of negligence by <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>was</b> supported by the evidence, and speculated that the jury might have found that helping a passenger board a moving train was a negligent act. He wrote that while the set of facts might be novel, the case was no different in principle from well-known court decisions on causation, such as the Squib case, in which an explosive (a squib) was lit and thrown, then was hurled away repeatedly by people not wanting to be hurt until it exploded near the plaintiff, injuring him; his suit against the man who had set the squib in motion was upheld. The majority also focused on the high degree of duty of care that the LIRR owed to Palsgraf, one of its customers.|$|E
5|$|The trial, Illinois vs. August Spies et al., {{began on}} June 21, 1886, {{and went on}} until August 11. The trial was {{conducted}} {{in an atmosphere of}} extreme prejudice by both public and media toward the defendants. It was presided over by Judge Joseph Gary. Judge Gary displayed open hostility to the defendants, consistently ruled for the prosecution, and failed to maintain decorum. A motion to try the defendants separately was denied. The defense counsel included Sigmund Zeisler, William Perkins Black, William Foster, and Moses Salomon. Selection of <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>was</b> extraordinarily difficult, lasting three weeks, and nearly one thousand people called. All union members and anyone who expressed sympathy toward socialism were dismissed. In the end a jury of 12 was seated, most of whom confessed prejudice towards the defendants. Despite their professions of prejudice Judge Gary seated those who declared that despite their prejudices they would acquit if the evidence supported it, refusing to dismiss for prejudice. Eventually the peremptory challenges of the defense were exhausted. Frustrated by the hundreds of jurors who were being dismissed, a bailiff was appointed who selected jurors rather than calling them at random. The bailiff proved prejudiced himself and selected jurors who seemed likely to convict based on their social position and attitudes toward the defendants. The prosecution, led by Julius Grinnell, argued that since the defendants had not actively discouraged the person who had thrown the bomb, they were therefore equally responsible as conspirators. The jury heard the testimony of 118 people, including 54 members of the Chicago Police Department and the defendants Fielden, Schwab, Spies and Parsons. Albert Parsons' brother claimed there was evidence linking the Pinkertons to the bomb. This reflected a widespread belief among the strikers.|$|E
