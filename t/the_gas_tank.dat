Afterwards, {{the two of them}} go back to waking up at the crash site. This time, Riki and Rin work together to save everyone at the crash scene. Kyousuke, who sneaked onto the bus (as a third year he was not allowed to go), managed to block the leak hole on <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>tank</b> to delay the explosion, despite his injuries being far greater than anyone else. Everyone in the bus recovers from their injuries, although Kyousuke's recovery takes longer due to extensive injuries. Finally, after Kyousuke returns, he rents a minibus, {{and the members of the}} Little Busters set out for a trip to the ocean.|$|E

50|$|Built between 1910 and 1921, <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>tanks</b> {{were built}} to hold <b>gas.</b> Until <b>the</b> 1960s, <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>tanks</b> had been {{maintained}} by an inspector using a rowboat.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>gas</b> <b>tanks</b> {{which are}} <b>the</b> most {{prominent}} features of any Gas Works, {{were to be}} of the ‘disappearing type’ that is only visible {{to the extent to which}} they are inflated and moreover they were to be placed upon the lower level of the site, which would be planted to almost completely screen the structures. The idea to make <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>tanks</b> as inconspicuous as possible seems to have been abandoned later as <b>the</b> other three <b>gas</b> <b>tanks</b> were added and, though they were also, ‘of the disappearing kind’, they were much higher than the first two and were more visible from <b>the</b> road. <b>The</b> <b>gas</b> <b>tanks</b> have become part of the skyline of the city and, rather than be an eyesore as the city anticipated in 1927, they are now regarded as a heritage landmark.|$|R

Until 2006, the effects included a damaged gas tank firing a large flame approximately every 10 minutes, but <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>tank</b> no longer operates because the cylinders that were used to fuel the flame were removed {{to make way for the}} construction of Stealth. The other effects are also currently nonoperational and have been out of order for several years.|$|E

Due to the bulky tank rear cargo space was considerably reduced. Drivers could choose whether their car should run on petrol or CNG {{at the touch of}} a button. On Bi-Fuel models the temperature gauge in the instrument cluster was replaced by a level gauge for <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>tank.</b> Several options, such as a trip computer and sports suspension, were not available for Bi-Fuel models.|$|E

25|$|At one point, <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>tank</b> exploded, {{which put}} out the store’s gaslights. The men worked on by candlelight and the glow from the {{approaching}} flames. The employees got enough steam up to operate the store’s powerful pumps in the basement, and volunteers went to the roof and used the store's fire hoses to wet down the roof and the wall {{on the side of}} the oncoming fire. Early in the following morning however, the city's waterworks burned, thus ending the water supply and making further efforts useless. The last employee had scarcely made it out of the building when it burst into flames, shooting fire from every window.|$|E
25|$|On Monday, October 7, 1985, four PLF militants hijacked Achille Lauro off Egypt. The hijackers {{had been}} {{surprised}} by a crew member and acted prematurely. The Palestinians had hidden their weapons in <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>tank</b> of a car parked in Italian in preparation for boarding the ship. Their smuggled weapons still with gasoline residue on them, gave off a smell that the crew had noticed but had not acted on. A cabin steward, with the hijackers' stateroom in his responsibilities, surprised the four Palestinians (as {{they were trying to}} use a hairdryer to clean the residue off their weapons) by entering the unlocked door to their room in order to deliver complimentary fruit. The hijackers plan to launch an attack on Ashdod, Israel was put aside as the terrorists panicked and moved to hijack the ship instead.|$|E

500|$|... "18 Miles Out" [...] was {{directed}} by Ernest Dickerson and co-written by Scott M. Gimple and showrunner Glen Mazzara. The storyline between Rick Grimes and Shane Walsh reaches a climax in [...] "18 Miles Out", {{in which the two}} men get into a heated argument, ultimately engaging in a physical confrontation. Gimple conceived and wrote the scene into the episode's script. In the fight scene, the moves were choreographed. Dickerson collaborated with Lonnie Smith, Jr. who served as the stunt coordinator. Smith cast two stuntmen to demonstrate and act out the scene for Lincoln and Bernthal so they could duplicate the choreography. Jeremy Connors portrayed Rick, while Trent Bry played the role of Shane. In the fight sequence, Shane topples a motorcycle onto Rick's legs, temporarily immobilizing him. The motorcycle weighed an estimated 800 pounds; in order to decrease the weight of the vehicle, Dickerson and his team emptied <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>tank.</b> This was rehearsed at the series' production studios. Scalan Backus, The Walking Deads special effects technician, rigged the vehicle's footpeg to prevent it from sliding and making contact with the actors' legs. Backus also added a rod with a secure stable so it would give further clearance to the actors and increase the motorcycle's height from the ground. The cameramen filmed the shots at an angle, creating the illusion that the vehicle did hit the actors' legs. Writer Robert Kirkman summated on the aftermath of the confrontation: ...|$|E

Billy Lane hand-fabricated <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>tank,</b> among the other contributions made by the team to build the bike (a vintage Pontiac car hood ornament of an Indian chief's bust was incorporated into the design of <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>tank).</b> Robert Pradke of Eastford, Connecticut applied purple paint with green flames.|$|E

40|$|A {{lightweight}} Unitized Regenerative Fuel Cell (URFC) Energy Storage System {{concept is}} being developed at the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC). This Unitized Regenerative Fuel Cell System (URFCS) is unique in that it uses Regenerative Gas Dryers/Humidifiers (RGD/H) that are mounted {{on the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> storage <b>tanks</b> that act as the radiators for thermal control of the Unitized Regenerative Fuel Cell System (URFCS). As <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> storage <b>tanks</b> cool down during URFCS charging the RGD/H dry the hydrogen and oxygen gases produced by electrolysis. As <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> storage <b>tanks</b> heat up during URFCS discharging, the RGD/H humidify the hydrogen and oxygen <b>gases</b> used by <b>the</b> fuel cell. An analytical model was developed to simulate the URFCS RGD/H. The model {{is in the form of}} a Microsoft (registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation) Excel worksheet that allows the investigation of the RGD/H performance. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) modeling of the RGD/H and <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> storage <b>tank</b> wall was also done to analyze spatial temperature distribution within the RGD/H and the localized tank wall. Test results obtained from the testing of the RGD/H in a thermal vacuum environment were used to corroborate the analyses...|$|R
