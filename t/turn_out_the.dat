25|$|By the 1960s, Lowe {{had made}} the {{transition}} to television and landed a regular role as draper/lay preacher Leonard Swindley in the northern drama series Coronation Street (1960–65). His character became sufficiently popular with viewers for him {{to appear in the}} spin-off series, Pardon the Expression (1966) and its sequel <b>Turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Lights (1967). Leonard Swindley was not a role Lowe relished and he longed to move on. During the months he was not playing Swindley, he was busy on stage or making one-off guest appearances in other TV series such as Z-Cars (1962) and The Avengers (1967).|$|E
25|$|Detective Tom (Sean Patrick Flanery) and {{his partner}} Ryan Alba (Greg Serano) {{have spent the last}} three years unsuccessfully trying to locate the Lion (Joe Pantoliano), an {{international}} hitman that has always eluded their grasp. They believe that they've found his location via a tipster but instead find Tom’s wife Kelly (Michelle Greathouse) tied up in a basement filled with explosives, surrounded by a black outline. The Lion calls Tom and commands him to kill Kelly or risk the entire house blowing up and killing everyone inside. Any attempt to evacuate the house or rescue Kelly will result in everyone getting blown up and the Lion will not accept any substitutions, as he wants Tom to suffer for messing up the Lion's network in the Southwestern United States. His only mercy is that Tom may <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> lights in the basement. With no other option, Tom has the lights turned off and he shoots and kills Kelly.|$|E

TISM's songs {{frequently}} satirised modern culture, celebrities and the entertainment industry, classic literature and art, current affairs, politics and sport. The titles of their songs were often wordplays created by juxtaposing pop culture references with more intellectual ones (for example, [...] "Would the Last Person to Leave Please <b>Turn</b> <b>Out</b> <b>the</b> Enlightenment?", [...] "Jung Talent Time" [...] and the album Machiavelli and the Four Seasons).|$|E

500|$|While storyboarding the episode, Castuera focused her {{attention}} on physical comedy. Moynihan, {{on the other}} hand, concentrated more on the emotional interactions between the characters, having been inspired by a past experience at couple's therapy. Together with other episodes of Cartoon Network programming, this episode helped make the network the number one television destination for boys aged 2–11, 6-11, and 9-14 on Monday nights. The episode received largely positive reviews from critics, with Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club and Mike Lechevaillier of Slate magazine praising [...] "Web Weirdos" [...] for its themes. On the other hand, Moynihan has expressed some disdain for the episode, reasoning {{that it did not}} <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> way he intended.|$|E

[...] Regarding a potential audience, Hubbard said, [...] "My music is for intelligent listeners, who don't mind if I change chords, and are willing to see what happens next." [...] Explaining why written text did not accompany the songs, Hubbard said, [...] "I wrote lots of poetry. But somehow it didn't feel right to have lyrics with the pieces – I'd rather leave that slot open for the listener." ...|$|E

The war dispersed the city's numerous Japanese-American businessmen {{due to the}} Japanese American internment. After the war, the local economy dipped. It rose again with Boeing's growing dominance in the commercial airliner market. Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, {{at a time when}} Boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises, loss of Government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the Boeing 747. Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading [...] "Will the last person leaving Seattle – <b>Turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> lights." ...|$|E

500|$|Louis Dow {{had died}} in 1944, with Frances Hand at his side. The Hands' {{marriage}} then entered its final, happiest phase, in which they rediscovered their first love. Former law clerks have provided intimate details of Hand's character {{during the last decade}} of his life. Legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin recalls that Hand, scrupulous about public economy, used to <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> lights in all the offices {{at the end of each}} day. For the same reason, he refused Dworkin the customary month's paid vacation at the end of his service. Shortly afterward, to Dworkin's surprise, Hand wrote him a personal check for an extra month's pay as a wedding present. Hand was known for his explosive temper. Gunther remembers him throwing a paperweight in his direction which narrowly missed. Hand had a habit of turning his seat 180° on lawyers whose arguments annoyed him, and he could be bitingly sarcastic. In a typical memo, he wrote, [...] "This is the most miserable of cases, but we must dispose of it as though it had been presented by actual lawyers." [...] Despite such outbursts, Hand was deeply insecure throughout his life, as he fully recognized. In his 80s, he still fretted about his rejection by the elite social clubs at Harvard College. He was convinced that his wife had rescued him from a life as a [...] "melancholic, a failure [...] I should have thought myself so, and probably single and hopelessly hypochondriac".|$|E
500|$|Egan meanwhile, wrote [...] "Folding Man", [...] "Nubbins", [...] "Edward", [...] "Warriors", and {{the first}} part of [...] "Revelations". He also co-wrote [...] "Sanctuary for All" [...] with Kindler. Egan liked to include the Rashomon effect in some of his scripts, a plot device which interprets scenes from {{different}} points of view. After writing [...] "Folding Man", Egan realized that he inadvertently based it on an episode of The X-Files. [...] "Nubbins" [...] was inspired by the [...] episode [...] "The Trouble With Tribbles". [...] "Edward" [...] was inspired by Egan hearing of a young English man with savant syndrome, who flew over a city he had not visited before, and was able to accurately draw the city on a mural some 20 feet wide. Because the episode involved an abnormal, Egan wanted the boy to draw much faster. In writing [...] "Warriors", Egan wanted to reintroduce Magnus' father Gregory Magnus from the webisodes; there were plans to introduce him in [...] "Fata Morgana", but the idea did not make it to the final episode. Gregory was written not to have the longevity of his daughter. Egan decided not to include a full explanation of how he survived a hundred years without aging, but wanted to hint to the audience that he was in fact cryogenically frozen by the Cabal. The intention behind [...] "Revelations" [...] was to tie some of the previous episodes together, particularly involving the Cabal, and then set them up for the second season. The main issue with writing the finale was showing Ashley being interrogated, where in fact she was experimented on to turn her to the Cabal. Because Kindler wrote his script quickly, he believed that the misdirect did not <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> way he hoped.|$|E
500|$|While {{the album}} was {{immersed}} further into mainstream R territory, Carey included some of her classic ballads and tender love songs on the album, working with writers and producers such as David Foster and Diane Warren. The idea to work with Warren was suggested by Foster, who thought that the two {{would be able to}} [...] "hammer out one hell of a ballad" [...] together. The two wrote and produced the song titled [...] "After Tonight." [...] Carey felt the song was a perfect metaphor for her relationship with Miguel, describing their romance in Capri. While the song was deemed a success by both parties, they described their working relationship with mixed feelings. According to Foster, who was involved in the writing session, Carey and Warren would not always agree on the lyrics and melodious structure of the song. He described it as a [...] "give and take relationship"; Warren would offer lyrics and Carey would not like them; she wanted something more intricate and detailed. Carey would produce a hook or lyrics that Warren did not feel were a perfect fit. In the end, Foster felt that they worked [...] "well together". After recording the song, Carey invited Miguel to record the song with her as a duet. However, after recording his verses several times, Foster and Carey realized that the song would not <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> way they planned. Foster said the song's key was [...] "too high for him"; the voices did not harmonize well. Carey did not have time to re-record her vocals in a lower key to accommodate Miguel's verses. Miguel, furious over the failed collaboration, later sent a cut-up tape of the demo to Foster. Carey, Warren, and Foster also wrote [...] "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)," [...] one of the other ballads featured on Rainbow.|$|E
