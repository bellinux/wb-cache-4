The first step was the telomerization of <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> {{in the presence of}} thioglycolic acid. Different molecular weights were obtained with different ratios of the monomer to the transfer agent.

The transfer constant of <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> with thioglycolic acid was assessed (chain-transfer constant 0. 6). In the second step, the terminal unsaturation of the oligomers was obtained by the reaction of the terminal acid groups with 2 -isocyanatoethyl methacrylate to yield the macromono-mers of <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>acrylate.</b> In the last step, the <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> groups were hydro-lyzed in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid at room temperature.

Various homogeneous asymmetric transformations, were investigated using these four complexes, viz., aldol, and Baylis-Hillman reactions, aza-Michael addition of piperidine to the Baylis-Hillman adducts, epoxidation, and ketone and imine reduction.

In the present study, methyl salicylate acrylate, salicyl <b>acrylate,</b> and <b>tert-butyl</b> salicylate <b>acrylate</b> monomers were polymerized yielding three novel reactive precursors suitable for the postpolymerization modification with primary and secondary amines. The reactivities of poly(pentafluorophenyl acrylate), poly(methyl salicylate acrylic ester), and poly(salicyl acrylate) toward amines were compared by kinetic studies and revealed the practical applicability of salicylic acid based derivatives for efficient postpolymerization modifications. In addition, in vitro cytotoxicity of water-soluble leaving groups, pentafluorophenol and salicylic acid, as well as water-soluble polymers containing the respective activated ester groups were investigated using HeLa cells. In short, compared to the frequently used poly(pentafluorophenyl acrylate), poly(salicyl acrylate) activated ester feature a lower reactivity, but exhibit less cytotoxicity.

Proximity effects of thermally conductive substrates for supported thin polymer films on the calibrated probe tip-sample interface temperature for heated AFM probes are elaborated. Having established the basic needs for the development of SThL in terms of heatable AFM probes, the well established polystyrene-block-poly(tert-butyl acrylate) (PS-b-PtBA) polymer film platform was explored for utilization in thermochemical surface activation reactions, starting with Reactive Imprint Lithography (RIL) at the macroscopic length scale. RIL comprises the topographical patterning and the simultaneous thermal deprotection of the tert-butyl ester protected carboxylic acid groups in the PtBA block. The successful thermal chemical functionalization followed by the wet chemical surface derivatization with e. g. poly(ethylene glycol), was followed by the introduction of SThL on the PS-b-PtBA film platforms to enable thermal chemical surface functionalization at the sub-micrometer length scale. Disadvantage of the block copolymer film platform were the observed thermomechanical surface deformations, exceeding 400 nm in diameter, after SThL. Therefore crosslinked <b>tert-butyl</b> (meth) <b>acrylate</b> polymer films were prepared and their thermal decomposition mechanism was analyzed in detail followed by their utilization in SThL.

According to the calculations, the reaction proceeds via five steps: (1) oxidative addition of hydrosilane, (2) hydride migration to carbon-carbon double bond of <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>acrylate,</b> which determines the chirality at C 2, (3) tautomerization from rhodium bound C-enolate to rhodium bound O-enolate, (4) intramolecular aldol reaction, which determines the chirality at C 3 and consequently the anti/syn-selectivity, and (5) reductive elimination to release aldol product. The hydride migration is the rate-determining step with a calculated activation energy of 23. 3 kcal mol(- 1). In good agreement with experimental results, the formation of anti-aldolates is found to be the most favorable pathway. The observed Si-facial selectivity in both hydride migration and aldol reaction are well-rationalized by analyzing crucial transition structures.

This is the first example of a CoPt 3 based polymer nanocomposite showing ferromagnetic behaviour at room temperature. Each nanocomposite particle contains a magnetic core composed of CoPt 3 nanoparticles (d ∼ 7 nm, a 0 = 3. 848 A°) encapsulated by poly(t-butyl acrylate). The CoPt 3 /PtBA latexes contain polyester groups that can be readily hydrolysed, rendering the surface with carboxylic functionalities and hence allowing bioconjugation. Complementary to such surface modification experiments, we report that bovine IgG antibodies can bind to the magnetic latexes, and {{the potential of the}} nanocomposites for in vitro specific bioapplications is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{connection}} with synthetic applications, we have foreseen {{to study the}} reactivity of the poorly reactive <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> electrophile with chiral imines of unsymmetrical ketones, using conventional or microwave flash heating under carefully controlled reaction conditions {{in order to develop}} a selective and efficient access to the corresponding Michael adducts in which a created stereogenic quaternary carbon center was fully stereocontrolled. Depending on the conditions, either a keto ester or a lactam were obtained. A good correlation was obtained between experiment and theoretical calculations. The stereoselectivity of the process (e> 95 %) was determined using natural abundance 13 C-{ 1 H} NMR in a chiral polypeptide liquid crystal. The scope of the reaction was screened using a set of electrophilic alkenes giving Michae...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of a GSK 2 nd generation inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus, by enantioselective 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition between a leucine derived iminoester and <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>acrylate,</b> was studied. The comparison between silver(I) and gold(I) catalysts in this reaction {{was established by}} working with chiral phosphoramidites or with chiral BINAP. The best reaction conditions {{were used for the}} total {{synthesis of}} the hepatitis C virus inhibitor by a four step procedure affording this product in 99 % ee and in 63 % overall yield. The origin of the enantioselectivity of the chiral gold(I) catalyst was justified according to DFT calculations, the stabilizing coulombic interaction between the nitrogen atom of the thiazole moiety and one of the gold atoms being crucial...|$|E
40|$|To {{combine the}} {{advantages}} of poly(2 -oxazoline) s (POx) and controlled radical polymerization (CRP) techniques, the cationic ring-opening polymerization (CROP) of 2 -methyl- 2 -oxazoline (MeOx), 2 -ethyl- 2 -oxazoline (EtOx), and 2 -n-nonyl- 2 -oxazoline (NonOx) were terminated with a carboxylic acid functionalized chain transfer agent (CTA). The obtained PEtOx {{with a high degree}} of functionalization (DF) was used as macro-CTA for the reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of various vinylic monomers (styrene (St), methyl acrylate (MA), <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> (tBuA), acrylic acid (AA), N,N-dimethyl acrylamide (DMAAm), and N,N-dimethylaminoethylacrylate (DMAEA)) resulting in well-defined block copolymers. Thus, in this work we report a versatile route to combine poly(2 -oxazoline) s prepared via Crop with RAFT polymerization for the synthesis of novel block copolymers...|$|E
40|$|PolyHIPE {{have proven}} to be useful in a large variety of {{applications}} included column filtration/separation, supported organic chemistry, as media for tissue engineering and 3 D cell culture. [1] We developed a new pHIPE platform by incorporation of a polymerizable monomer with amino group into the HIPE available for different post polymerizations. [2] The pHIPE with amino groups on the surface (pHIPE-NH 2) can be directly used for the ring opening polymerization of amino acids N-carboxyanhydrates (NCAs) to obtain pHIPE-g- polypeptides or easily converted to an atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) initiator for activators generated electron transfer (AGET) ATRP of <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>acrylate.</b> The polymers grafted were deprotected to form or pHIPE-g-poly(acrylic acid) with reactive groups {{on the surface of the}} pHIPE, available for bioconjugation of fluorescent proteins such as enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP...|$|E
40|$|Poly(methyl methacrylate) -b-poly(tert-butyl acrylate) (PMMA-b-PtBA) {{copolymers}} {{have been}} successfully synthesized by the sequential anionic polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> (tBA) in THF at - 78 -degrees-C. Although the order of monomer addition makes a difference on the initiation efficiency, it has no {{significant effect on the}} final achievement. Mono- and bifunctional initiators based on alkali metals can be used. When the initiators are modified by LiCl as a ligand, the polymerization of each block appears to be living, the molecular weight and composition can be predicted, and the molecular weight distribution is narrow. Size exclusion chromatography supports the absence of homo-PtBA in the PtBA-b-PMMA samples. The PtBA blocks can be quantitatively hydrolyzed into polyacid ones as supported by titration and H- 1 NMR analysis. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Three controlled/living {{polymerization}} processes, namely atom transfer {{radical polymerization}} (ATRP), ring opening polymerization (ROP) and iniferter polymerization, and photoinduced radical coupling reaction were combined for {{the preparation of}} ABCBD-type H-shaped complex copolymer. First, a-benzophenone functional polystyrene (BP-PS) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (BP-PMMA) were prepared independently by ATRP. The resulting polymers were irradiated to form ketyl radicals by hydrogen abstraction of the excited benzophenone moieties present at each chain end. Coupling of these radicals resulted {{in the formation of}} polystyrene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) with benzpinacole structure at the junction point possessing both hydroxyl and iniferter functionalities. ROP of e-caprolactone (CL) by using PS-b-PMMA as bifunctional initiator, in the presence of stannous octoate yielded the corresponding tetrablock copolymer, PCL-PSPMMA- PCL. Finally, the polymerization of <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> (tBA) via iniferter process gave the targeted H-shaped block copolyme...|$|E
30|$|In this work, {{we tried}} to {{fabricate}} a novel type of water-dispersible BIC using the double hydrophilic poly(acrylic acid)-b-poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(acrylic acid) (PAA-b-PEO-b-PAA) triblock copolymer and cationic surfactant DTAB. The BIC formed the core–shell structure nanoparticles with the core consisting of the DTAB neutralized PAA blocks and the thin shell of looped PEO blocks. The looped PEO blocks in the shell hindered the further neutralization of the PAA blocks with cationic DTAB, resulting in that the zeta-potential of the nanoparticles remained negative over the whole DN range. The PAA-b-PEO-b-PAA triblock copolymer with well-defined structure was synthesized via ATRP of <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> (t-BA) and followed by selective acidolysis of the Pt BA block. The nanoparticles of PAA-b-PEO-b-PAA were formed by binding oppositely charged surfactant (DTAB) in aqueous solution has been investigated using turbidimetry, dynamic light scattering (DSL), zeta-potential, and atomic force microscope (AFM).|$|E
