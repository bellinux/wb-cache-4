5|$|In 2012, an Atari Jaguar port of Another World was {{confirmed}} {{and approved by}} Chahi. It was released as a limited collector's item in cartridge form, complete with a box and manual published by the association Retro-gaming Connexion (RGC) in 2013. The game engine was rewritten especially for the Atari Jaguar <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> console's several processors: the GPU and blitter perform polygon rendering; the GPU performs on-the-fly data decompression; the DSP plays stereo music and sound effects; and the 68000 CPU performs JIT compilation and execution of the scripts. The Jaguar version is playable in the original graphics 16-color mode and Deluxe 15th Anniversary graphics 256-color mode. It can be played in normal and speed-run modes. It supports five languages: English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish.|$|E
5|$|In October, Diederichs {{planned to}} rotate his ships through repair {{facilities}} in the region for periodic maintenance; Prinzess Wilhelm was scheduled to dock in Shanghai.

Diederichs was able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> murder {{of a pair of}} German priests on 6 November in Shangtung, however, to justify his move against Kiaochou. At the time, the only ships available for the attack were Prinzess Wilhelm and Kaiser. Cormoran joined the two ships after a few days, and by 10 November, the ships were ready. Prinzess Wilhelm left port on the 11th, to rendezvous with Kaiser and Cormoran at sea.|$|E

5|$|Joe Law of GameFocus {{criticized the}} Rage Gage system, stating {{that it had}} been done better in other games. However he cited the game's overall length a good thing as he felt the game had no replay value. Nick Valentino of GameZone praised the game, calling it the best RPG <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dragon Ball label, and the game was the perfect {{introduction}} into the franchise. Mike Moehnke of RPGamer cited the games as not being perfect, but was superior to the Super Famicom game Legend of the Super Saiyan. Kat Bailey of 1UP.com felt the game was made with children in mind, stating that the vibrant colors and the fast-paced gameplay would keep kids interested in the game.|$|E
5|$|The quick pace {{of change}} meant that many ships were {{obsolete}} {{as soon as they}} were finished, and that naval tactics were in a state of flux. Many ironclads were built <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ram or the torpedo, which a number of naval designers considered the important weapons of naval combat. There is no clear end to the ironclad period, but towards the end of the 1890s the term ironclad dropped out of use. New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or armored cruisers.|$|E
5|$|After {{the victory}} over Mattau the {{governor}} decided <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soldiers to cow other recalcitrant villages, starting with Taccariang, {{who had previously}} killed both VOC employees and Sinkan villagers. The villagers first fought with the Sinkanders who were acting as a vanguard, but on receiving a volley from the Dutch musketeers the Taccariang warriors turned and fled. The VOC forces entered the village unopposed, and burnt it to the ground. From Taccariang they moved on to Soulang, where they arrested warriors {{who had participated in}} the 1629 massacre of sixty Dutch soldiers and torched their houses. The last stop on the campaign trail was Tevorang, which had previously sheltered wanted men from other villages. This time the governor decided to use diplomacy, offering gifts and assurances of friendship, with the consequences of resistance left implicit. The Tevorangans took the hint, and offered no opposition to Dutch rule.|$|E

5|$|Arriving at Batavia in the {{aftermath}} of the engagement, Linois was the subject of criticism from the Dutch governors for his failure to defeat the China convoy. They also refused his requests <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dutch squadron stationed in port for future operations. Rejoined by Atalante, Linois sold two captured country ships and resupplied his squadron, before sailing for Isle de France, Marengo arriving on 2 April. During the return journey, Linois had detached his frigates and they captured a number of valuable merchant ships sailing independently before joining the admiral at Port Louis, which Decaen had renamed Port Napoleon. On his arrival, Linois was questioned by Decaen about the engagement with the China Fleet and when Decaen found his answers unsatisfactory the governor wrote a scathing letter to Napoleon, which he despatched to France on Berceau. Linois remained at Isle de France for the next two and a half months, eventually departing with Marengo, Atalante and SÃ©millante in late June, while Belle Poule was detached to cruise independently.|$|E
5|$|As the game's {{dialogue}} {{consists of}} a lot of wordplay and misunderstandings, Smith would analyze scenes before writing them: he would see what the scenes were trying to accomplish, and where the beats in them were. After he had the structure of a scene in his head, he would write it; at times he was able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original Japanese dialogue, {{but most of the time}} he had to come up with new ideas himself. At several points, the English wordplay was inspired by the wordplay in the Japanese version. At some points, it was not possible to do wordplay in the same places as in the Japanese version, so Smith would change the structure of the scene slightly. At other points, Smith came up with a joke or funny line, and changed the scene to make the joke work. Around half of the jokes were rewritten based on the characters present in the scene, rather than being translations of the Japanese jokes.|$|E
5|$|As word of {{the massacres}} got out, many Jews fled; in Ukraine, 70 to 90 per cent of the Jews ran away. This was seen by the leader of Einsatzkommando VI as beneficial, as it would save the regime the costs of deporting the victims further east over the Urals. In other areas the {{invasion}} was so successful that the Einsatzgruppen had insufficient forces to immediately kill all the Jews in the conquered territories. A situation report from Einsatzgruppe C in September 1941 noted that not all Jews {{were members of the}} Bolshevist apparatus, and suggested that the total elimination of Jewry would {{have a negative impact on}} the economy and the food supply. The Nazis began to round their victims up into concentration camps and ghettos and rural districts were for the most part rendered Judenfrei (free of Jews). Jewish councils were set up in major cities and forced labour gangs were established <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jews as slave labour until they were totally eliminated, a goal that was postponed until 1942.|$|E

5|$|Following the Norman {{conquest of}} England in 1066, William the Conqueror subdued {{the north of}} the country in a {{sequence}} of harsh campaigns, and the north-west region became a contested border territory between the Normans and the Scottish kings. William's son, William Rufus, invaded the north-west in 1091 and built Brough Castle around 1092, placing it in the north part of the old Roman fort in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing earthworks, in a similar way to nearby Brougham and Lancaster. The north side of the site overlooks the River Eden. This castle {{appears to have been a}} motte and bailey design; the keep had stone foundations and a main structure built from timber, while the rest of the former fort was turned into a palisaded bailey. The village of Church Brough was created alongside the castle at around the same time, in the form of a planned settlement, part of the Norman colonisation of the low-lands in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{decided to}} return to a gameplay style similar to the original Genesis Sonic games, which producer Yuji Naka felt was refreshing. Despite this, they also included concepts that were incorporated in the Dreamcast games, such as the ability to grind on rails and and the modernized character designs by Yuji Uekawa. As the Sonic games released for the Dreamcast allowed players to download the Chao Garden minigame onto the VMU, the development team decided to expand upon this idea by implementing a similar minigame that was compatible with the GameCube's GBA link cable, thus making Sonic Advance one of the first games <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cable. It also makes use of graphical techniques such as rotation effects and Mode 7. The game's musical score was composed by Yutaka Minobe and Tatsuyuki Maeda.|$|E
5|$|While Keats had {{remained}} with his prize Saumarez {{had led the}} remainder of the squadron forward, although Audacious had been left far behind the rest of the British force. The French and Spanish ships had scattered as Superb attacked the rearguard and during the night each made their way separately to the rendezvous off Cadiz harbour. As dawn broke at 04:00 on 13 July, lookouts on the leading British ship of the line Venerable under Captain Samuel Hood spotted the French ship Formidable, under the command of Captain Amable Troude in the absence of Linois, to the north. Formidable was trailing the rest of the squadron, close to the shore in Conil Bay to the south of Cadiz and north of Cape Trafalgar. The wind was light and coming from the land and so Caesar and Spencer, the latter being a long way behind the others, were unable to approach the French ship and it was left to Venerable and Thames, both inshore and therefore better able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wind, to lead the attack. Formidable had only jury topmasts following the battle on 6 July, and so Hood was able to rapidly approach the French ship, coming under fire from Troude's stern guns at 05:15, Hood holding off from replying until 05:20 so as to not delay his progress. The light breeze was at that point in Hood's favour, and Venerable was able to come close alongside Formidable and open fire with a full broadside. Off Cadiz, the remnants of Moreno's squadron formed up with the intention of sailing to Formidables aid, but were struck by a calm and could only watch the battle to the south.|$|E
