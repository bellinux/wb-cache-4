5|$|Because the {{fireball}} {{was recorded}} by two cameras of the European Fireball Network, {{it was possible}} to calculate the trajectory of its flight through the atmosphere, and afterward also the characteristics of both its pre- and post-encounter orbit in the Solar System. <b>The</b> <b>calculations</b> were published by Czech astronomers Pavel Spurný, Zdeněk Ceplecha, and Jiří Borovička of the Ondřejov Observatory, who specialize in meteor observations. They demonstrated that the swing by the earth significantly altered the meteoroid's orbit. Its aphelion (the farthest it travels from the Sun) and orbital period were lowered to almost half of their original values. The object was initially in a highly inclined orbit (71°) and ended in an orbit with a slightly higher inclination (74°).|$|E

5|$|Bethe {{continued}} to do research on supernovae, neutron stars, black holes, and other problems in theoretical astrophysics into his late nineties. In doing this, he collaborated with Gerald E. Brown of Stony Brook University. In 1978, Brown proposed that they collaborate on supernovae. These were reasonably well understood by this time, but <b>the</b> <b>calculations</b> were still a problem. Using techniques honed from decades of working with nuclear physics, and some experience with calculations involving nuclear explosions, Bethe tackled the problems involved in stellar gravitational collapse, {{and the way in}} which various factors affected a supernova explosion. Once again, he was able to reduce the problem to a set of differential equations, and solve them.|$|E
5|$|Bethe {{managed to}} work it out on the train from New York to Schenectady. He arrived at a value of 1040MHz, {{extremely}} close to that obtained experimentally by Lamb and Retherford. He did so by realising that it was a non-relativistic process, which greatly simplified <b>the</b> <b>calculations.</b> His paper, published in the Physical Review in August 1947 was only two pages long and contained just 12 mathematical equations, but was enormously influential. Hitherto, it had been assumed that the infinities meant that QED was fundamentally flawed, and that a new, radical theory was required. Bethe demonstrated that this was not necessary.|$|E

30|$|This paper mainly replies to the {{discussion}} by Li et al (2009) on <b>the</b> <b>calculation</b> of <b>the</b> detachment depths in the Kuqa Depression.

However, {{it does not mean that}} <b>the</b> <b>calculation</b> method loses effectiveness in the study area. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>calculation</b> results are still relatively believable.|$|R

5|$|Prior to this burst, astronomers had {{not reached}} {{consensus}} regarding {{how far away}} GRBs occur from Earth. Although the isotropic distribution of bursts suggested {{that they do not}} occur within the disk of the Milky Way, some astronomers supported the idea that they occur within the Milky Way's halo, concluding that the bursts are visibly faint because they are not highly energetic. Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and that they can be detected because they are extremely energetic. The distance measurement and <b>the</b> <b>calculations</b> of the burst's total energy release unequivocally supported the latter theory, effectively ending the debate.|$|E
5|$|Richardson {{envisioned a}} large {{auditorium}} {{of thousands of}} people performing <b>the</b> <b>calculations</b> and passing them to others. However, the sheer number of calculations required was too large to be completed without the use of computers, {{and the size of the}} grid and time steps led to unrealistic results in deepening systems. It was later found, through numerical analysis, that this was due to numerical instability. The first computerised weather forecast was performed by a team composed of American meteorologists Jule Charney, Philip Thompson, Larry Gates, and Norwegian meteorologist Ragnar Fjørtoft, applied mathematician John von Neumann, and ENIAC programmer Klara Dan von Neumann. Practical use of numerical weather prediction began in 1955, spurred by the development of programmable electronic computers.|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} to the above assumptions, we prescribe constraints on <b>the</b> <b>calculation</b> time for one re-planning.

On {{the basis of this}} knowledge, <b>the</b> <b>calculation</b> time was limited to five minutes in a previous study that addressed rearrangement planning [6]. Re-planning modules may be required several times. Therefore, <b>the</b> selected <b>calculation</b> time for one re-planning module should be shorter than <b>the</b> <b>calculation</b> time for off-line planning. In this paper, the selected time limit for one re-planning module is one minute.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>calculations</b> that {{purported to}} show that {{bumblebees}} cannot fly are based upon a simplified linear treatment of oscillating aerofoils. The method assumes small amplitude oscillations without flow separation. This ignores the effect of dynamic stall (an airflow separation inducing a large vortex above the wing), which briefly produces several times the lift of the aerofoil in regular flight. More sophisticated aerodynamic analysis shows the bumblebee can fly because its wings encounter dynamic stall in every oscillation cycle.|$|E
