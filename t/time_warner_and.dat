5|$|Portland Monthly (also {{referred}} to as Portland Monthly Magazine) is a monthly news and general interest magazine which covers events and culture in Portland, Oregon. The magazine was co-founded in 2003 by siblings Nicole and Scott Vogel. Nicole had previously worked for Cendant Corporation and <b>Time</b> <b>Warner,</b> <b>and</b> Scott had been a journalist at The New York Times. Though the magazine had some trouble with funding in its first year, it grew to a stable circulation of 56,000 and by 2006 was the seventh-largest city magazine in the United States.|$|E
5|$|After the article's publication, the Church of Scientology {{mounted a}} public {{relations}} campaign to address issues in the piece. It took out advertisements in USA Today for twelve weeks, and Church leader David Miscavige was interviewed by Ted Koppel on Nightline about what he {{considered to be an}} objective bias by the article's author. Miscavige alleged that the article was actually driven by the company Eli Lilly, because of Scientology's efforts against the drug Prozac. The Church of Scientology brought a libel suit against <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> <b>and</b> Behar, and sued Reader's Digest in multiple countries in Europe in an attempt to stop the article's publication there. The suit against Time Warner was dismissed in 1996, and the Church of Scientology's petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States was denied in 2001.|$|E

50|$|<b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> faces {{industry}} {{competition from}} traditional media {{companies such as}} Sony, CBS Corporation, 21st Century Fox, Viacom, The Walt Disney Company, <b>and</b> Comcast. <b>Time</b> <b>Warner's</b> <b>and</b> many of their competitions' business may be severely impacted by the increasing viewership of feature films, television programming and other content online with low ad-income, which decreases company revenues.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to Adelphia's coverage being divided up, Time Warner Cable and Comcast {{also agreed to}} exchange {{some of their own}} subscribers in order to consolidate key regions. An example of this is the Los Angeles market, which was mostly covered by Comcast and Adelphia (and some areas of the region already served by TWC), is now under Time Warner Cable. Philadelphia had been split between <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> <b>and</b> Comcast, with the majority of cable subscribers belonging to Comcast. Time Warner subscribers in Philadelphia were swapped with Comcast in early 2007. Similarly, the Houston area, which was under Time Warner, was swapped to Comcast, while the Dallas metro area was changed to Time Warner (RR). In the Twin Cities, Minneapolis was <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> <b>and</b> Saint Paul was Comcast. That whole market is now Comcast.|$|E

25|$|In June 2014, Murdoch's 21st Century Fox made {{a bid for}} Time Warner at $85 {{per share}} in stock and cash ($80 billion total) which Time Warner's board of {{directors}} turned down in July. Warner's CNN unit would have been sold to ease antitrust issues of the purchase. On 5 August 2014 the company announced it had withdrawn its offer for <b>Time</b> <b>Warner,</b> <b>and</b> said it would spend $6 billion buying back its own shares over the following 12 months.|$|E

The two companies paid a total of $17.6billion in the deal that was finalized {{in the second quarter}} of 2006—after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) completed a seven-month investigation without raising an objection. Time Warner Cable became the second-largest cable provider in the U.S., ranking behind Comcast. As part of the deal, <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> <b>and</b> Comcast traded existing subscribers in order to consolidate them into larger geographic clusters.|$|E

25|$|As a DC Comics-based show, the Super Friends {{franchise}} {{was owned}} by DC's parent company Warner Bros., who later put the series into syndication. Thus, Cartoon Network, which had the rights to air {{most of the rest}} of the Hanna-Barbera library from its inception in 1992, was not able to air Super Friends until after the merger of Warner Bros. parent company <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> <b>and</b> Cartoon Network parent company Turner Broadcasting System was completed in 1996. This merger also led to Warner Bros. taking control of Hanna-Barbera and all of its other assets as well. The series {{was owned by}} Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, DC Entertainment and Warner Bros.

25|$|With the 2004 {{acquisition}} of Universal Studios by General Electric and merging with GE's NBC, Universal Music Group was cast under separate management from the eponymous film studio. This {{is the second}} time a music company has done so, the first being the separation of <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> <b>and</b> Warner Music Group. In February 2006, the label became 100% owned by French media conglomerate Vivendi when Vivendi purchased the last 20% from Matsushita (renamed as Panasonic Corporation in 2008), the group's sole owner from 1990 to 1995 and co-owner from 1995 to 2006. On June 25, 2007, Vivendi completed its €1.63billion ($2.4billion) purchase of BMG Music Publishing, after receiving European Union regulatory approval, having announced the acquisition on September 6, 2006.|$|E
25|$|With Scooby-Doo's {{restored}} {{popularity in}} reruns on Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation and Hanna-Barbera (by then {{a subsidiary of}} Warner Bros. following the merger of <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> <b>and</b> Turner Entertainment in 1996) began producing one new Scooby-Doo direct-to-video movie a year beginning in 1998. These movies featured a slightly older version of the original five-character cast from the Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! days. The first four DTV entries were Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island (1998), Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost (1999), Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders (2000), and Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase (2001). Frank Welker was the only original voice cast member to return for these productions. Don Messick had died in 1997 and Casey Kasem, a strict vegetarian, relinquished the role of Shaggy after having to provide the voice for a 1995 Burger King commercial. Therefore, Scott Innes took over as both Scooby-Doo and Shaggy (Billy West voiced Shaggy in Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island). B.J. Ward took over as Velma, and Mary Kay Bergman voiced Daphne until her death in November 1999, {{and was replaced by}} Grey DeLisle.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} White House's complaint, CNN chairman, president, and CEO Tom Johnson {{announced}} {{he believed that}} in hindsight {{it was a mistake}} to allow 13 members of CNN's on-air staff (including Larry King and Bernard Shaw) to appear in the film, even though both CNN and Warner Bros. are owned by Time Warner. Johnson added that, for Contact, the CNN presence [...] "creates the impression that we're manipulated by <b>Time</b> <b>Warner,</b> <b>and</b> it blurs the line." [...] CNN then changed their policies for future films, which now requires potential appearances to be cleared through their ethics group.|$|E

500|$|The Church {{brought a}} libel lawsuit against <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> <b>and</b> Behar, seeking damages of $416million. The Church alleged false and {{defamatory}} statements were made concerning the Church of Scientology International in the Time article. More specifically, the Church of Scientology's court statements claimed that Behar had been refining an anti-Scientology focus since his 1986 article in Forbes, which included gathering negative materials about Scientology, and [...] "never accepting anything a Scientologist said and uniformly ignoring anything positive {{he learned about}} the Church". In its initial complaint filing, the Church quoted portions of the Behar article that it alleged were false and defamatory, including the quote from Cynthia Kisser, and Behar's own assertion that Scientology was a [...] "global racket" [...] that intimidated individuals in a [...] "Mafia-like manner".|$|E
500|$|Because of {{the history}} of {{conflict}} between Reader's Digest and Scientology, the writer of a 2005 cover story on Tom Cruise agreed to certain demands, including giving Scientology issues equal play in the writer's profile of Cruise, submitting questions for Cruise to Church of Scientology handlers, and sending the writer of the article to a one-day Church immersion course. Also in 2005, an article in Salon questioned whether the tactics of the Church's litigation and private investigations of <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> <b>and</b> other media sources had succeeded in decreasing the amount of investigative journalism pieces on Scientology in the press. A 2005 article in The Sunday Times cited the article, and came to the determination that the Church of Scientology's lawsuit against Time Warner [...] "served to warn off other potential investigations", and that [...] "The chill evidently lingers still".|$|E

The game's producer, Algy Williams, hired puzzle expert Chris Maslanka, whose output he called [...] "fiendishly difficult", to design the game's puzzles together with John Morris. Williams also employed sculptor Greg Boulton, who had previously worked on the Peter Gabriel video [...] "Sledgehammer". Drowned God music was written and performed by an ambient music duo operating under the name Miasma. William S. Burroughs was originally scheduled to narrate the game, but died just before he could begin recording. McGaw and Williams later founded the company Babel Media, which specializes in video game localization.|$|E

500|$|In late 1996, while {{developing}} {{the project on}} its way through, the studio saw the film as a perfect vehicle for Brad Bird, {{who at the time}} was working for Turner Feature Animation developing Ray Gunn. Turner Entertainment had recently merged with Warner Bros. parent company <b>Time</b> <b>Warner,</b> <b>and</b> Bird was allowed to transfer to the Warner Bros. Animation studio to direct The Iron Giant. After reading the original Iron Man book by Hughes, Bird was impressed with the mythology of the story and in addition, was given an unusual amount of creative control by Warner Bros. This creative control involved introducing two new characters not present in the original book, Dean and Kent, setting the film in America, and discarding Townshend's musical ambitions (who did not care either way, reportedly remarking, [...] "Well, whatever, I got paid"). Bird's pitch to Warner Bros. was based around the idea [...] "What if a gun had a soul?" [...] He expanded upon his desire to set the film in America in the 1950s in a later interview: ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power" [...] {{continues}} to be used today by journalists in the media, as a reference for historical information on the Church of Scientology. In April 2007, CNN anchor Anderson Cooper interviewed former Office of Special Affairs director Mike Rinder, in a live piece on Anderson Cooper 360° titled [...] "Inside Scientology". The CNN story was prompted by the May 2007 airing of a BBC Panorama investigative program, [...] "Scientology and Me". In the interview, Anderson Cooper quoted directly from [...] "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power" [...] article, when asking Rinder {{about the history of}} Operation Snow White, and if those tactics were currently used by the Church. Rinder answered by stating that the individuals involved with Operation Snow White were no longer involved in Church of Scientology activities, and that the incident was [...] "ancient history". Cooper then again referenced the Time magazine article noting that Behar asserted that he was illegally investigated by Scientology contacts during research for his article. Cooper questioned Rinder on the dismissed lawsuit against <b>Time</b> <b>Warner,</b> <b>and</b> Rinder acknowledged that all of the Church of Scientology's appeals against Time Warner were eventually rejected.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Madonna founded her own {{multi-media}} entertainment company, Maverick, {{consisting of}} a record company (Maverick Records), a film production company (Maverick Films), and associated music publishing, television broadcasting, book publishing and merchandising divisions. The deal was {{a joint venture with}} <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> <b>and</b> paid Madonna an advance of $60million. It gave her 20% royalties from the music proceedings, one of the highest rates in the industry, equaled at that time only by Michael Jackson's royalty rate established a year earlier with Sony. Madonna said that she envisioned the company as an [...] "artistic think tank" [...] and likened it to a cross between the Bauhaus, the innovative German arts institute formed in Weimar in 1919, and Andy Warhol's New York-based Factory of artists and assistants. She stated: [...] "It started as a desire to have more control. There's a group of writers, photographers, directors and editors that I've met along the way in my career who I want to take with me everywhere I go. I want to incorporate them into my little factory of ideas. I also come in contact with a lot of young talent that I feel entrepreneurial about."
