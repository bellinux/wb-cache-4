It also has regular bus service on Eglinton Ave. E. and Bayview Ave. The easy access to public transportation and the proximity to the Downtown core, results in {{a higher percentage of}} residents using public <b>transit</b> <b>and</b> self-propulsion (walking/biking). Davisville's transportation mode shows that 46.5% of residents use public <b>transit</b> <b>and</b> 11.9% walked <b>or</b> biked to their destination, compared to the City of Toronto's transportation mode which shows that only 34.4% of residents use public <b>transit</b> <b>and</b> 8.8% walk <b>or</b> bike. The 2006 census data also shows that Davisville neighbourhood has a lower percentage of vehicle users than the city of Toronto. 40.1% of residents in Davisville use car, trucks, vans, and/or motorcycles to get to their destination compared to Toronto's 55.8%.|$|R

50|$|The {{acceptable}} trade-off between loss {{of audio}} quality <b>and</b> transmission <b>or</b> <b>storage</b> size {{depends upon the}} application. For example, one 640MB compact disc (CD) holds approximately one hour of uncompressed high fidelity music, less than 2 hours of music compressed losslessly, or 7 hours of music compressed in the MP3 format at a medium bit rate. A digital sound recorder can typically store around 200 hours of clearly intelligible speech in 640MB.|$|R

25|$|Carbon capture, utilization, <b>and</b> {{sequestration}} (<b>or</b> <b>storage)</b> {{is increasingly}} being utilized in modern coal gasification projects {{to address the}} greenhouse gas emissions concern {{associated with the use}} of coal and carbonaceous fuels. In this respect, gasification has a significant advantage over conventional coal combustion, in which CO2 resulting from combustion is considerably diluted by nitrogen and residual oxygen in the near-ambient pressure combustion exhaust, making it relatively difficult, energy-intensive, and expensive to capture the CO2 (this is known as “post-combustion” CO2 capture).|$|R
40|$|Carbon capture <b>and</b> {{sequestration}} (<b>or</b> <b>storage)</b> - {{known as}} CCS - has attracted interest {{as a measure}} for mitigating global climate change because large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO 2) emitted from fossil fuel use in the United States are potentially available to be captured <b>and</b> stored underground <b>or</b> prevented from reaching the atmosphere.
