5|$|More than {{a hundred}} {{languages}} are spoken in Winnipeg, of which the most common is English: 99 percent of Winnipeggers are fluent English speakers, 88 percent speak only English, and 0.1 percent speak only French (Canada's other official language). 10 percent speak both English and French, while 1.3 percent speak neither. Other languages spoken as a mother <b>tongue</b> <b>in</b> Winnipeg include Tagalog (5.0%), German (2.5%), and Punjabi and Ukrainian (both 1.4%). Several Aboriginal languages are also spoken, such as Ojibwe (0.3%) and Cree (0.2%).|$|E
5|$|Nerve-endings {{similar to}} the Pacinian corpuscle, found in the mucous {{membrane}} of the <b>tongue,</b> <b>in</b> pits on the beak and {{in other parts of}} the bodies of birds. They differ from Pacinian corpuscles in being smaller and more elongated, in having thinner and more closely placed capsules and in that the axis-cylinder in the central clear space is encircled by a continuous row of nuclei.|$|E
5|$|A rigid {{structure}} {{called the}} plica mediana or lytta {{runs from the}} front to the back, {{down the center of}} the sublingua to give it support. The plica mediana is usually made of cartilage and attaches the sublingua to the underside of the <b>tongue.</b> <b>In</b> lemuriforms, the sublingua mostly consists of two plicae fimbriatae (singular: plica fimbriata), which run along the sides of the plica mediana and end in comb-like serrated edges that are hardened with keratin. The plicae fimbriatae move freely over a limited range. The plica sublingualis, which is found in all primates, but is particularly small in lemuriforms, attaches the tongue and sublingua to the floor of the mouth. Tarsiers have a large but highly generalized sublingua, but their closest living relatives, monkeys and apes, lack one.|$|E

5|$|In {{all human}} {{cultures}} premastication/kiss-feeding or kissing {{between mother and}} infant has been observed in all with kissing {{believed to be a}} socially ritualized form of feeding premasticated food. There is high similarity in the execution of kiss-feeding and human kisses (e.g. French kiss); in the former, the tongue is used to push food from mother to child with the child receiving both the mother's food and <b>tongue</b> <b>in</b> sucking movements, and the latter simply forgoes the premasticated food. In fact, observations across various species and cultures confirms that the act of kissing and premastication have most likely evolved from the similar relationship-based feeding behaviours.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} career, after scoring a goal, Del Piero often celebrated by {{running to the}} touchline {{in front of the}} fans with his arms out-stretched, and {{sticking}} out his <b>tongue,</b> <b>in</b> a similar manner to Michael Jordan, also frequently leaping into the air with a raised fist towards the sky, or sliding onto his knees whilst passionately chanting to the crowd. Del Piero also performed a back-flip goal celebration in a 2008 UEFA Champions League match against Zenit, and he also pointed up at the sky after scoring on certain occasions, to dedicate a goal to his late father, such as when he scored against Bari during the 2000–01 season, and Mexico at the 2002 World Cup.|$|E

5|$|In this way, the Quenya {{language}} was {{symbolic of the}} high status of the Elves, the firstborn of the races of Middle-earth, because of their close connection to Valinor, and its decreasing use also became symbolic of the slowly declining Elven culture in Middle-earth. In the Second Age of Middle-earth's chronology the Men of Númenor learnt the Quenya <b>tongue.</b> <b>In</b> the Third Age, {{the time of the}} setting of The Lord of the Rings, Quenya was learnt as a second language by all Elves of Noldorin origin, and it continued to be used in spoken and written form, but their mother-tongue was the Sindarin of the Grey-elves. As the Noldor remained in Middle-earth, their Noldorin dialect of Quenya also gradually diverged from the Vanyarin dialect spoken in Valinor, undergoing both sound changes and grammatical changes.|$|E
5|$|Mucinous, clear {{secretions}} may collect {{within these}} cysts to form either spherical masses or fusiform swellings, rarely larger than 2 to 3cm in diameter. These {{are present in}} the midline of the neck anterior to the trachea. Segments of the duct and cysts that occur high in the neck are lined by stratified squamous epithelium, which is essentially identical to that covering the posterior portion of the <b>tongue</b> <b>in</b> the region of the foramen cecum. The disorders that occur in the lower neck more proximal to the thyroid gland are lined by epithelium resembling the thyroidal acinar epithelium. Characteristically, next to the lining epithelium, there is an intense lymphocytic infiltrate. Superimposed infection may convert these lesions into abscess cavities, and rarely, give rise to cancers.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie {{visit the}} local Quahog bank so that Brian can deposit holiday {{money in his}} safe deposit box. Stewie then {{wants to go to}} a store to return a $3,000 Thom Browne sweater. While they are still inside the vault, the door closes {{at the end of the}} work day and locks them inside until the next morning. Frightened, Stewie soils his diaper. Worried he will get a rash from the dirty diaper, Stewie desperately tries to make Brian eat his feces by {{threatening}} him with a gun that Brian had stored in his deposit box. They discover that Stewie has a cellphone in his pocket, but there's only enough charge in the battery for one short phone call. Unfortunately, Stewie uses the last of the phone's battery charge to call the clothing store rather than for help. Enraged, Brian hits Stewie, throws his phone on the ground (thus breaking the phone), and yells at Stewie, making him cry. Instantly remorseful and wanting to repair his relationship with Stewie, Brian reluctantly agrees to eat Stewie's feces in order to provide him with a clean diaper and make up for making Stewie cry. While watching Brian eating, Stewie becomes nauseated and throws up; Stewie then convinces Brian to eat his puke, correctly pointing out that Brian likes the taste of vomit. Realizing that he has nothing to clean his bottom with, Stewie manages to convince Brian to clean his bottom with his <b>tongue</b> <b>in</b> order to avoid infection, much to Stewie's pleasure. Afterward, they both decide to take a nap, but soon they realize that the next day is Sunday, meaning that they will have to wait another day before they can be released from the vault.|$|E

5|$|The armies met on 21 June in Lochaber and Alexander, {{suffering}} the defection of Clan Chattan (the MacKintoshes) and Clan Cameron, was heavily defeated. Alexander escaped probably to Islay but James continued his {{assault on the}} Lordship by taking the strongholds of Dingwall and Urquhart castles in July. The king pushed home his advantage when an army reinforced with artillery was dispatched to the isles. Alexander probably realised that his position was hopeless and tried to negotiate terms of surrender but James demanded and received his total submission. From August 1429 the king delegated royal authority to Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar for the keeping of the peace {{in the north and}} west. The Islesmen rose again in September 1431 and inflicted two important defeats on the king's men – Mar's army was beaten at Inverlochy and Angus Moray's in a fierce battle near <b>Tongue</b> <b>in</b> Caithness. This was a serious setback for James and his credibility was adversely affected. In 1431, before the September uprising, the king had arrested two of his nephews, John Kennedy of Carrick and Archibald, Earl of Douglas possibly {{as a result of a}} conflict between John and his uncle, Thomas Kennedy in which Douglas may have become involved. Douglas's arrest had raised tensions in the country and James acted to reduce the unrest by freeing the earl on 29 September – it was quite likely that the king made the earl's release conditional on support at the forthcoming parliament at Perth at which James intended to push for further funding for the campaign against the Lordship. Parliament was in no mood to allow James unconditional backing – he was allowed a tax to fund his Highland campaign but parliament retained full control over the levy. The rules parliament attached to the taxation indicated a robust stand against further conflict in the north and probably led to the turnaround that took place on 22 October when the king 'forgave the offence of each earl, namely Douglas and Ross '. For Douglas this was a formal acknowledgement of his having already been freed three weeks earlier but for Alexander this was a total reversal of crown policy towards the Lordship. Four summer campaigns against the Lordship were now officially at an end with James's wishes having effectively been blocked by parliament.|$|E
