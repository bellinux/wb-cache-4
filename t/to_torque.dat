25|$|All {{four of the}} innermost, rocky planets of the Solar System {{may have}} had large {{variations}} of their obliquity in the past. Since obliquity is the angle between the axis of rotation and the direction perpendicular to the orbital plane, it changes as the orbital plane changes due {{to the influence of}} other planets. But the axis of rotation can also move (axial precession), due <b>to</b> <b>torque</b> exerted by the sun on a planet's equatorial bulge. Like Earth, all of the rocky planets show axial precession. If the precession rate were very fast the obliquity would actually remain fairly constant even as the orbital plane changes. The rate varies due to tidal dissipation and core-mantle interaction, among other things. When a planet's precession rate approaches certain values, orbital resonances may cause large changes in obliquity. The amplitude of the contribution having one of the resonant rates is divided by the difference between the resonant rate and the precession rate, so it becomes large when the two are similar. Mercury and Venus have most likely been stabilized by the tidal dissipation of the Sun. Earth was stabilized by the Moon, as mentioned above, but before its capture, Earth, too, could have passed through times of instability. Mars's obliquity is quite variable over millions of years and may be in a chaotic state; it varies as much as 0° to 60° over some millions of years, depending on perturbations of the planets. Some authors dispute that Mars's obliquity is chaotic, and show that tidal dissipation and viscous core-mantle coupling are adequate for it to have reached a fully damped state, similar to Mercury and Venus.|$|E
2500|$|A Super trim of the LaCrosse debuted for 2008. The LaCrosse Super was {{positioned}} as a higher-performance {{model of the}} sedan with revised front end styling, {{as well as a}} return of displaying four Ventiports under the hood, a rear spoiler, projector beam fog lights, Magnasteer, larger brakes, and revised suspension tuning with standard Stabilitrak. Interior changes included special Super badged cluster with blue face, a wood grain shift knob, and dream weave leather seating. [...] Interior colors for the Super were Platinum and Mocha Brown, while exterior color choices were Mocha Brown Metallic, Black Onyx, Red Jewel Tincoat, and Platinum Metallic. [...] Power came from the 5.3L LS4 small-block V8 engine featuring Active Fuel Management technology, which is routed to the front wheels. The combination of a V8 and front-wheel drive are not often utilized due <b>to</b> <b>torque</b> steer which is present in any front-wheel-drive car. [...] This powertrain was also found on the Grand Prix GXP, Impala SS, and Monte Carlo SS. The Super model was one of the fastest modern production Buicks ever built, with a factory top speed of , and 0–60mph times of 5.7 seconds. Only the 1987 Buick GNX offered a similar level of performance ratings until the Super was introduced. The LaCrosse Super was discontinued in 2009.|$|E

Two gyros {{stabilize}} the stable platform {{and provide for}} various compensations to be introduced, keeping the stable platform level with respect to earth instead of inertial space, and providing a coordinate reference system of three axes. The gyros each have two degrees of freedom, and are oriented so that the spin axes are 90 degrees apart. The upper gyro has its spin axis oriented along the north-south grid coordinate axis and is sensitive <b>to</b> <b>torques</b> (airplane rotations) about the east-west and vertical coordinate axes. The lower gyro has its spin axis oriented along the east-west grid axis and is sensitive <b>to</b> <b>torques</b> about the north-south and vertical axes. Therefore the two gyros control all three axes.|$|R
