40|$|Ultra high {{temperature}} ceramic based Zirconium composite “Wedge” was fabricated with suitable dimensions required for high speed combustor using centrifugal <b>thermit</b> <b>process.</b> The wedges are normally {{used in the}} application of the ‘flame holding’ and ‘fuel injection’ of the combustor. The basic requirement of the wedge is that it has to have a very high thermal shock resistance along with near erosion free control surface in un-cooled conditions. Also it has to withstand ultra {{high temperature}}s of the order of 2000 K under extreme heat flux of 10 MW/m 2 and high velocity of gas injection. Wedge shaped strut was machined with special techniques to get the required shape. It was fastened inside the water cooled rectangular duct using tungsten carbide dowel pins. The wedge was tested at the High Speed Combustor Test Facility (HSCTF), with the air flow conditions of 5 bar pressure and with an average temperature of 1900 K. The flow velocity was at Mach number 2 for the duration of 20 seconds. Experiments were repeated many times with the same inlet flow conditions. Thermal shock conditions were created by abruptly bringing down the flow temperature from 1900 K to 300 K with in short duration of 5 seconds. The strut was intact even after several repeated tests except for oxidation coating. The mechanical properties and microstructure characteristics of fuel strut specimens after the combustor test have been investigated and compared with just fabricated material before the test. X-ray radiography also corroborates the flaw less condition of the strut. These results have been discussed in light of the integrity and surface micro structure mechanisms involved in the evaluation process...|$|E
50|$|The long rails {{could be}} {{conveyed}} to site {{by a special}} train, and unloaded on to the ground (by chaining the end in position and pulling the train out from underneath the rails). The long rails had to be welded together (or to adjacent track) using a site welding process; and, after initial experimentation, the proprietary <b>Thermit</b> welding <b>process</b> was used. This was an alumino-thermic process in which a powder 'portion' was ignited; the aluminium was the fuel and a metallurgically appropriate composition of molten steel descended into {{the gap between the}} rail ends, contained in refractory moulds.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this paper}} general {{concepts}} about the centrifugal <b>thermit</b> (C-T) <b>process</b> with few illustrative examples are presented. Thermit reactions {{are carried out}} under the effect of centrifugal force. The application of centrifugal force in these processes helps in the quick separation of {{the products of the}} thermit reaction, if they are of different densities and produced in molten state. If the magnitude of the centrifugal force is inadequate, the products are produced as mixtures. A detailed description of the process carried out such as synthesizing the required product phases, insitu consolidation and castings of aerospace components are reviewed. The advantages and limitations of these methods have been analyzed by considering the property versus degree of conversion dependencies of several reactant systems. A brief introduction to the applications of combustion-synthesized products is followed by a discussion of the methods for fabrication. A few novel techniques based on C-T process, used in aerospace applications are elaborated. 1...|$|R

With the laying of the track the 357, 5 m lengths are temporarily fishboulded together, then a team of two men do the final thermit weld. The bold is taken off, a piece of track is cut out, a mould is formed around the gap and with intense heat a thermit weld fills this gap. Basically, a little urn is placed above the mould, thermit is poured in powder form, heated and it flows in to the gap. You see Marty hitting away the mould. A new mould is used for every new weld.
