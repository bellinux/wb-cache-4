5|$|Batman Returns was {{released}} on June 19, 1992. The film was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Makeup, {{as well as two}} BAFTA awards. Its budget was $80 million and it grossed $266.8 million worldwide, making the film a financial success. The film received generally positive reviews for its action sequences, acting, Danny Elfman's score, effects, and villains, though the dark and depressing <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> heavily criticized.|$|E
5|$|Before {{and during}} their marriage, Crawford worked to promote Tone's Hollywood career, but <b>Tone</b> <b>was</b> {{ultimately}} {{not interested in}} being a movie star and Crawford eventually wearied of the effort. After Tone reportedly began drinking and becoming physically abusive, she filed for divorce, which was granted in 1939. Crawford and Tone much later rekindled their friendship and Tone even proposed in 1964 that they remarry. When he died in 1968, Crawford arranged {{for him to be}} cremated and his ashes scattered at Muskoka Lakes, Canada.|$|E
5|$|Flooding of {{adjacent}} moor {{land was}} partially addressed during the 13thcentury by {{the construction of}} a number of embankment walls to contain the Parrett. They included Southlake Wall, Burrow Wall, and Lake Wall. The River <b>Tone</b> <b>was</b> also diverted by the Abbot of Athelney and other land owners into a new embanked channel, joining the Parrett upstream from its original confluence.|$|E
50|$|High <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> {{indicated}} with {{an acute}} accent. Low <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> unmarked. Falling <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> indicated by {{a sequence of}} acute-accented vowel and an unmarked vowel.|$|R
5000|$|As {{in other}} Kru languages, <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> {{extremely}} important. For instance, né {{with a high}} (or high-mid) <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> the first-person pronoun [...] "I", while nè with a low <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> [...] "you" [...] singular.|$|R

5|$|The book {{became a}} bestseller and was well {{received}} by {{graduates of the}} est training. Reviewers generally commented that the book was favorable to Erhard, {{and a number of}} critics felt that it was unduly so, or lacked objectivity, citing Bartley's close relationship to Erhard. Responses to the writing were mixed; while some reviewers found it well written and entertaining, others felt the <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> too slick, promotional, or hagiographic.|$|E
5|$|ILM was {{tasked with}} imagining what the {{immediate}} assimilation of an Enterprise crewmember would look like. Jaeger {{came up with}} a set of cables that sprang from the Borg's knuckles and buried themselves in the crewmember's neck. Wormlike tubes would course through the victim's body and mechanical devices break the skin. The entire transformation was created using computer-generated imagery. The wormlike geometry was animated over the actor's face, then blended in {{with the addition of a}} skin texture over the animation. The gradual change in skin <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> simulated with shaders.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} influences on History of a Six Weeks' Tour was Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark (1796), written by Mary Shelley's mother Mary Wollstonecraft. A travel narrative that reflects on topography, politics, society, aesthetics, and the author's personal feelings, it provided a model for Mary Shelley's work. Like her mother, Mary Shelley revealed her liberalism by boldly discussing politics; however, this political <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> unusual for travel works at the time and was considered inappropriate for women writers. Like Wollstonecraft's Letters, History of a Six Weeks' Tour blurs the line between private and public spheres by using intimate genres such as the journal and the letter, allowing Mary Shelley to present political opinions through personal anecdote and the picturesque.|$|E
50|$|In poems, <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> the {{expression}} of attitude. <b>Tone</b> <b>is</b> also linked with poetic voice.|$|R

50|$|The tone {{contours}} of the Sichuanese dialects are highly and quite {{different from those of}} Beijing Mandarin. In Sichuanese, the first tone (dark level <b>tone)</b> <b>is</b> a high level tone (like Beijing), the second tone (light level <b>tone)</b> <b>is</b> a low falling tone (the mirror image of Beijing), the third <b>tone</b> (rising <b>tone)</b> <b>is</b> a high falling tone and the fourth <b>tone</b> (departing <b>tone)</b> <b>is</b> a low or mid rising tone (interchanged compared to Beijing) and the fifth <b>tone</b> (entering <b>tone)</b> <b>is</b> mid or high if it's not merged, as shown in the chart below.|$|R
5|$|Savary's {{return to}} port {{marked the end of}} the last attempt by a {{continental}} nation to land troops in Ireland. French losses in the operation were so severe that a repeat effort was never seriously contemplated. Similarly, the huge Irish losses during the rebellion, combined with British reprisals against the Irish populace, ended any hopes of reigniting the uprising in the near future. Most serious of all for the United Irishmen was the arrest of Wolfe Tone himself, who was discovered among the prisoners taken from Hoche at Buncrana. <b>Tone</b> <b>was</b> charged with treason and sentenced to death, though he committed suicide in Dublin before the sentence could be carried out.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{marked the}} last {{attempt by the}} French Navy to launch an {{invasion}} of {{any part of the}} British Isles. It also ended the last hopes the United Irishmen had of obtaining outside support in their struggle with the British. After the action, <b>Tone</b> <b>was</b> recognised aboard the captured French flagship and arrested. He was brought ashore by the British at Buncrana, on the Inishowen Peninsula. He was later tried for treason, convicted, and committed suicide while in prison in Dublin, hours before he was to be hanged.|$|E
5|$|As Zwingli {{was working}} on {{establishing}} these political alliances, Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, invited Protestants to the Augsburg Diet to present their views {{so that he could}} make a verdict on the issue of faith. The Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession. Under the leadership of Martin Bucer, the cities of Strasbourg, Constance, Memmingen, and Lindau produced the Tetrapolitan Confession. This document attempted to take a middle position between the Lutherans and Zwinglians. It was too late for the Burgrecht cities to produce a confession of their own. Zwingli then produced his own private confession, Fidei ratio (Account of Faith) in which he explained his faith in twelve articles conforming to the articles of the Apostles' Creed. The <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> strongly anti-Catholic as well as anti-Lutheran. The Lutherans did not react officially, but criticised it privately. Zwingli's and Luther's old opponent, Johann Eck, counter-attacked with a publication, Refutation of the Articles Zwingli Submitted to the Emperor.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Tones</b> <b>are</b> {{sometimes}} {{indicated in}} writing, and sometimes not.

5|$|By mid-1826, the Canal Company had {{insufficient}} funds {{to complete the}} work, and a special meeting authorised the taking out of a mortgage to cover the £15,000 deficit. The canal was an obvious competitor to the River Tone Navigation, which was managed by the Conservators of the River Tone, a legal body created for that purpose by Act of Parliament in 1699. There was animosity between the Company and the Conservators, with the Company maintaining {{that they had a}} right to use the Tone to reach the centre of Taunton, and the Conservators maintaining that they did not. The canal was scheduled to be opened on 1 January 1827, but the opening was delayed until 3 January, as the connection to the River <b>Tone</b> <b>was</b> not made until 2 January. The opening celebrations were hampered by snow and bitter cold weather.|$|E
5|$|In Ireland, {{the failure}} of the French expeditionary force was the source of great frustration: Wolfe Tone, who was aboard Indomptable {{throughout}} the voyage, reported that he felt that he could have touched either side of the bay with both hands. Postponing the uprising, Tone continued to rally support in Europe, raising a fleet in the Netherlands for an attempted invasion that ended in destruction at the Battle of Camperdown. In May 1798, a British crackdown arrested the leaders of the United Irishmen in Ireland and provoked the Irish Rebellion. By the time the French had managed to gather a small force and reach Ireland in August, the rebellion was almost over and the inadequate French army, led by Jean Humbert, surrendered in September at the Battle of Ballinamuck. A subsequent invasion attempt the following month also ended in failure, when the invasion squadron was intercepted and defeated at the Battle of Tory Island. Wolfe <b>Tone</b> <b>was</b> captured at the action off Tory Island and committed suicide in prison. His death, combined with military defeat and reprisals against the Irish rebels, ended both the Society of United Irishmen and French invasion plans.|$|E
5|$|Michael Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American {{singer who}} spent over four {{decades in the}} public eye, first as a child star with The Jackson 5, and later as a solo artist, during which time he went through various image changes. Starting in the mid-1980s, {{it became clear that}} Jackson's {{appearance}} was changing dramatically. The shape of his face, particularly his nose, triggered widespread speculation of extensive cosmetic surgery. His skin tone became much lighter. Although Jackson, a black man, was diagnosed with the skin disorder vitiligo, which results in white patches on the skin, and said that he had not purposely bleached his skin but had used makeup to even out his skin tone, it was also widely suggested that his lighter skin <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> partly due to skin bleaching.|$|E
5000|$|The tonal {{system is}} however marginal. Trager {{describes}} the tones as being distinguished by pitch differences. The mid <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> {{by the most}} commonly occurring tone; high <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> limited to a few stems and suffixes; the low <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> relatively common in stem syllables. The high <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> described as [...] "higher and sharper" [...] than the mid tone while the low <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> [...] "distinctly lower and drawling". Many words are distinguished solely by tonal differences as in the following minimal pairs which demonstrate {{the contrast between the}} mid tone and the low tone in stressed syllables: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{physical}} {{characteristics of the}} transmitted sequence of <b>tones</b> <b>is</b> tightly controlled. Each <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> generated for a predefined period, {{in the order of}} tens of milliseconds. Each subsequent <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> transmitted immediately after the preceding one for the same period, until the sequence is complete.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tones</b> <b>are</b> high, mid, low, rising, falling. They {{are written}} as in IPA, apart from low, {{which is not}} written: á ā a ǎ â. Falling <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> largely {{confined}} to suffixes, and rising <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> rare, found only on a few nouns such as tǎ 'father'.|$|R

25|$|In {{terms of}} tone and style, Reformation propaganda, while {{sometimes}} serious in <b>tone,</b> <b>was</b> often satirical, featuring word-play and sarcasm. In this it developed earlier medieval traditions of religious satire. One {{example of this}} would be Martin Luther's commentary on the Life of John Chrysostom in his Die Lügend von S. Johanne Chrysostomo.|$|E

50|$|Isochronic <b>tones</b> <b>are</b> regular beats of {{a single}} <b>tone</b> that <b>are</b> used {{alongside}} monaural beats and binaural beats in the process called brainwave entrainment. At its simplest level, an isochronic <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> a <b>tone</b> that <b>is</b> being turned on and off rapidly. They create sharp, distinctive pulses of sound.|$|R
50|$|The rising <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> {{marked with}} a {{trailing}} X, the departing tone with a trailing H. The level and entering <b>tones</b> <b>are</b> unmarked.|$|R
25|$|He was baptised as Theobald Wolfe Tone {{in honour of}} his godfather, Theobald Wolfe of Blackhall, County Kildare, a {{first cousin}} of Arthur Wolfe, 1st Viscount Kilwarden. However, it was widely {{believed}} that <b>Tone</b> <b>was</b> the son of Theobald Wolfe, which if true made him a half-brother of the poet Charles Wolfe.|$|E
25|$|The StingRay {{also found}} itself {{especially}} popular with shoegazing {{artists of the}} early 90s, likely because its <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> so effective at cutting through the multilayered distortion characteristic of the genre. Steve Queralt of Ride, Nick Chaplin of Slowdive, Russell Barrett of Chapterhouse, and Fernando Gatillo Belazaras of CAMION, all found their sound in the StingRay, among others.|$|E
25|$|His godfather, {{a cousin}} of Arthur Wolfe, Lord Kilwarden, who {{according}} to local gossip was Tone's father, warned Tone to leave Ireland in 1795. Then when <b>Tone</b> <b>was</b> arrested and brought to Dublin in 1798, and facing certain execution, it was Kilwarden (a senior judge) who granted two orders for Habeas Corpus for his release. This was a remarkable act, given that the rebellion had just occurred with great loss of life, and one that could never be enlarged upon as Kilwarden was killed {{at the beginning of}} Emmet's revolt in 1803. The suggestion is that the Wolfes knew that <b>Tone</b> <b>was</b> a cousin. As a pillar of the Protestant Ascendancy and notorious at the time for his prosecution of United Irishman William Orr, Kilwarden had no apparent motive for trying to assist Tone in 1795 and 1798. Portraits of Wolfe around 1800 arguably show a resemblance to Wolfe Tone.|$|E
5000|$|The {{language}} has four basic tones: high, low, strong mid, and weak mid. While {{the high and}} low <b>tones</b> <b>are</b> unremarkable, the two mid <b>tones</b> <b>are</b> only differentiated by differences in their behavior when referencing tone rules, and not by their pitch. These unusual mid <b>tones</b> <b>are</b> found in all northern Senufo languages but not in central Senufo languages, which only have three tones. * high <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> indicated by an acute accent: á é ɛ́ í ó ɔ́ ú; ...|$|R
5000|$|Also called fifth tone or zeroth tone (in Chinese [...] qīng shēng, literal meaning: [...] "light tone"), neutral <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} {{thought of}} as a lack of <b>tone.</b> It <b>is</b> associated with weak syllables, which are generally somewhat shorter than tonic syllables. The pitch of a syllable with neutral <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> determined by the tone of the preceding syllable. The following table shows the pitch at which the neutral <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> pronounced in Standard Chinese after each of the four main tones. The situation differs by dialect, and in some regions, notably Taiwan, the neutral <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> relatively uncommon.|$|R
5000|$|Karlgren {{interpreted}} {{the names of}} the first three tones literally as level, rising and falling pitch contours, respectively.However, the pitch contours of modern reflexes of these categories vary so widely {{that it is impossible to}} reconstruct Middle Chinese contours.The oldest known description of the <b>tones</b> <b>is</b> found in a Song dynasty quotation from the early 9th century Yuanhe Yunpu [...] (no longer extant): [...] "Level <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> sad and stable. Rising <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> strident and rising. Departing <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> clear and distant. Entering <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> straight and abrupt."In 880, the Japanese monk Annen described the even tone as [...] "straight and low", the rising tone as [...] "straight and high", and the departing tone as [...] "slightly drawn out".|$|R
