5|$|With {{investment}} subsidies, {{the financial}} burden falls upon the taxpayer, while with feed-in tariffs the extra cost is distributed across the utilities' customer bases. While the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer, the main argument in favour of feed-in tariffs is the encouragement of quality. Investment subsidies are paid out {{as a function of}} the nameplate capacity of the installed system and are independent of its actual power yield over time, thus rewarding the overstatement of power and tolerating poor durability and maintenance. Some electric companies offer rebates to <b>their</b> <b>customers,</b> such as Austin Energy in Texas, which offers $2.50/watt installed up to $15,000.|$|E
5|$|In Greco-Roman times saffron {{was widely}} traded across the Mediterranean by the Phoenicians. <b>Their</b> <b>customers</b> {{ranged from the}} perfumers of Rosetta, in Egypt, to {{physicians}} in Gaza to townsfolk in Rhodes, who wore pouches of saffron in order to mask the presence of malodorous fellow citizens during outings to the theatre. For the Greeks, saffron was widely associated with professional courtesans and retainers known as the hetaerae. Large dye works operating in Sidon and Tyre used saffron baths as a substitute; there, royal robes were triple-dipped in deep purple dyes; for the robes of royal pretenders and commoners, the last two dips were replaced with a saffron dip, which gave a less intense purple hue.|$|E
5|$|Quebec is the {{regional}} market leader in Canada, with about 11,000 plug-in electric cars registered , of which, 55% are plug-in hybrids. Registrations {{in the province}} totaled 3,100 units in 2015, representing a market share of 0.7% of new car sales, and 45% of total Canadian plug-in electric car sales that year. In October 2016, the National Assembly of Quebec passed a new zero emission vehicle legislation that obliges major automakers selling cars in the Canadian province to offer <b>their</b> <b>customers</b> a minimum number of plug-in hybrid and all-electric models. Under the new law, 3.5% {{of the total number}} of autos sold by carmakers in Quebec have to be zero emissions vehicles starting in 2018, rising to 15.5% in 2020. A tradable credit system was created for those carmakers not fulfilling their quotas to avoid financial penalties. Quebec aims to have 100,000 zero emission vehicles on the road by 2020.|$|E

5|$|Service design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of service design. It is the activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication, and material components of a service. The aim {{is to improve the}} quality of the service, the interaction between the service provider and its customers, and the customer's experience. The increasing importance and size of the service sector in terms of people employed and economic importance requires that services should be well-designed in order to remain competitive and to continue to attract customers. Design management traditionally focuses in the design and development of manufactured products; service design managers can apply many of the same theoretical and methodological approaches. Systematic and strategic management of service design helps the business gain competitive advantages and conquer new markets. Companies that proactively identify the interests of <b>their</b> <b>customers</b> and use this information to develop services that create good experiences for the customer will open up new and profitable business opportunities.|$|E
5|$|Trucking {{companies}} (motor carriers) {{can also}} play a role in HOS violations. Certain carriers may choose to knowingly ignore HOS violations made by their drivers, or even encourage their drivers to do so. Allowing drivers to violate the HOS is an effective cost-cutting measure used mostly by non-union, long haul carriers. Permitting HOS violations allows a carrier to hire fewer drivers, and run on fewer trucks than a company which follows the rules. To comply with the HOS, these companies would have to hire more drivers (possibly driving up wages) and purchase additional trucks and trailers. Making a change to comply with the law is complicated by competition with carriers that already comply with HOS regulations. Due to this competition, carriers who choose to switch from non-compliance could not pass on all of their increased costs associated with HOS compliance to <b>their</b> <b>customers.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{investigating}} a murder involving a hitman, Howard (Melissa Leo) and Felton (Daniel Baldwin) question Miles Stradinger (Paul Schulze), {{who serves as}} an arbitrator between hitmen and <b>their</b> <b>customers.</b> Stradinger gives up several of his clients, including Calpurnia Church (Mary Jefferson), a woman suspected of murdering five husbands for insurance money. Although Church denies killing anybody, the detectives find enough evidence to close many outstanding cases. Lewis, who had previously been investigating the Church case, believes his prayer with Crosetti led to her arrest. This is further upheld when Crosetti receives an anonymous call claiming a man named Alfred Smith shot Thormann. While searching for Smith, Crosetti meets a man named Charles Flavin (Larry E. Hull) who said he saw Smith shoot Thormann and will testify to it in court. The episode ends with Crosetti sitting with an unconscious Thormann {{in the hospital and}} listening to jazz music, which the two friends used to discuss frequently.|$|E

5|$|The Western Han capital at Chang'an {{was divided}} into one hundred and sixty walled {{residential}} wards. Affairs of each ward were overseen by a low-ranking official. Influential families within the wards usually maintained social order. Historians are still unsure as to how many government-controlled marketplaces existed in Chang'an. Although there are claims of nine markets, {{it is possible that}} seven of them were actually divisible parts of two main markets: the East Market and West Market. Both the East Market and West Market had a two-story government office with a flag and drum placed on the roof. A market chief and deputy were headquartered in each of these buildings, yet not much is known about their involvement in the marketplace. In the Eastern Han capital of Luoyang, the market chief's office employed thirty-six sub-officers who ventured into the marketplace daily to maintain law and order. They also collected taxes on commercial goods, assigned standard prices for specific commodities on the basis of monthly reviews, and authorized contracts between merchants and <b>their</b> <b>customers</b> or clients. Besides merchants engaging in marketplace violations, other crimes were committed by adolescent street gangs who often wore clothes distinguishing their gang. The maintenance of law and order outside the market and in slum areas was conducted by constables; Han officials sometimes argued for increasing their salaries which they assumed would encourage them to reject bribes from criminals.|$|E

25|$|When the United States {{began to}} expand {{to the west}} {{and other parts of the}} country, so did the {{distance}} of businesses to <b>their</b> <b>customers.</b> When businesses were close to those who purchased goods or services from them, it was easy for the merchants to extend credit to them, due to their proximity and the fact that merchants knew <b>their</b> <b>customers</b> personally and knew whether or not they would be able to pay them back. As trading distances increased, merchants no longer personally knew <b>their</b> <b>customers</b> and became leery of extending credit to people who they did not know in fear of them not being able to pay them back. Business owners' hesitation to extend credit to new customers led to the birth of the credit reporting industry.|$|E
