The scientific research balloons used by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) use internal caps. A NASA cap placement specification does not exist since no empirical information exisits concerning cap placement. To develop a cap placement specification, NASA has completed two in-hangar inflation tests comparing the structural contributions of internal caps and external caps. The tests used small scale <b>test</b> <b>balloons</b> designed to develop the highest possible stresses within the constraints of the hangar and balloon materials. An externally capped <b>test</b> <b>balloon</b> and an internally capped <b>test</b> <b>balloon</b> were designed, built, inflated and simulated to determine the structural contributions and benefits of each.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The study aimed on the {{catheter}} interventional {{treatment of}} congenital portosystemic venous shunt (CPSVS) in childhood {{and the impact}} on vascular growth of hypoplastic portal veins. Clinical course and follow up of partial or complete closure of CPSVS are described. BACKGROUND: CPSVS is a very rare vascular malformation of the portal venous drainage resulting in potentially life threatening abdominal, pulmonary, cerebral, and cardiac complications. The anatomic type, clinical course, and diagnosis must be determined for optimal management. METHODS: Single centre case series. RESULTS: Eight (6 female) children with extrahepatic (n[*]=[*] 5) and intrahepatic (n[*]=[*] 3) CPSVS were diagnosed invasively by catheterization, including <b>test</b> <b>balloon</b> occlusion of the shunt and simultaneous retrograde angiography, and treated by catheter interventions (n[*]=[*] 5) with partial (n[*]=[*] 2) and complete (n[*]=[*] 3) occlusion of CPSVS at a median age of 3. 9 years (range 0. 7 - 21). Congenital heart disease (CHD) was the most frequent associated organ manifestation (n[*]=[*] 5) followed by mild to severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (n[*]=[*] 4), hepatopulmonary syndrome (n[*]=[*] 2), and portosystemic encephalopathy (n[*]=[*] 1). CHD was simple (n[*]=[*] 3) or complex type (n[*]=[*] 2). Three patients were untreated so far, {{because they were in}} excellent clinical condition at an age < 1 year, refused treatment, or planned for later treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate invasive diagnosis of CPSVS with <b>test</b> <b>balloon</b> occlusion of the shunt is mandatory to depict the anatomic situation. Catheter interventional treatment of CPSVS offers a feasible and safe approach with complete or partial closure of the vascular malformation inducing potentially significant vascular growth of a former hypoplastic portal venous system. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

When data obtained under all tested conditions {{for each type of}} balloon were pooled and normalized according to the parameters in each corresponding regression equation (Eq. 1), the dimensionless variable (balloon volume − a)/b was fitted closely with (balloon pressure − c)/d along the standard sigmoid curve (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1).

30|$|A {{three-way}} stopcock {{was connected}} to the balloon lumen of the catheter. Mechanical ventilation was not terminated during balloon manipulation to mimic an actual clinical scenario. The balloon was first deflated by generating a negative pressure, followed by opening the balloon to the atmosphere for 3  min to standardize the residual volume remaining in the balloon and the catheter lumen. The balloon was then progressively inflated in 0.5 -ml increments to a volume that resulted in a deviation in the balloon pressure from the chamber pressure that exceeded 1  cmH 2 O. Balloon inflation was performed at end-expiration. At each <b>tested</b> <b>balloon</b> volume, after 3 -min equilibration period, end-expiratory and end-inspiratory occlusion was performed (each for 10  s), and balloon pressure and chamber pressure were simultaneously measured during the last second.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the risk of}} temporary or permanent internal carotid artery occlusion. METHODS: In 156 patients intraarterial <b>balloon</b> <b>test</b> occlusion in combination with a stable xenon-enhanced CT cerebral blood flow study was performed before radiologic or surgical treatment. All 156 patients passed the clinical <b>balloon</b> <b>test</b> occlusion and underwent a xenon study in combination with a second <b>balloon</b> <b>test.</b> Quantitative flow data were analyzed for absolute changes as well as changes in symmetry. RESULTS: Fourteen patients exhibited reduced flow values between 20 and 30 mL / 100 g per minute, an absolute decrease in flow, and significant asymmetry in the middle cerebral artery territory during <b>balloon</b> <b>test</b> occlusion. These patients would be considered {{at high risk for}} cerebral infarction if internal carotid artery occlusion were to be performed. With one exception they belonged to a group (class I) of 61 patients who showed bilateral or ipsilateral flow decrease and significant asymmetry with lower flow on the side of occlusion. The other 95 patients, who showed a variety of cerebral blood flow response patterns including ipsilateral or bilateral flow increase, were at moderate (class II) or low (class Ill) stroke risk. In contrast to these findings, exclusively qualitative flow analysis failed to identify the patients at high risk: a threshold with an asymmetry index of 10 % revealed only 16 % specificity whereas an asymmetry index of 45 % showed only 61 % sensitivity for detection of low flow areas (< 30 mL/ 1 00 g per minute).

40|$|Gamma-ray {{astronomy}} in the MeV range {{suffers from}} weak fluxes from sources and high {{background in the}} nuclear energy range. The background comes primarily from neutron-induced gamma rays, with the neutrons being produced by cosmic-ray interactions in the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s atmosphere, the spacecraft, and the instrument. Compton telescope designs often suppress this background by requiring coincidences in multiple detectors and a narrow time-of-flight (ToF) acceptance window. The COMPTEL experience on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory shows that a 1. 9 -ns ToF resolution is insufficiently narrow to achieve the required low background count rate. Furthermore, neutron interactions in the detectors themselves generate an irreducible background. By employing LaBr 3 scintillators for the calorimeter, one {{can take advantage of}} the unique speed and resolving power of the material to improve the instrument sensitivity and simultaneously enhance its spectroscopic performance and thus its imaging performance. We present a concept for a balloon- or space-borne Compton telescope that employs deuterated liquid in the scattering detector and LaBr 3 as a calorimeter and estimate the improvement in sensitivity over past realizations of Compton telescopes. We show initial laboratory test results from a small prototype, including energy and timing resolution. Finally, we describe our plan to fly this prototype on a <b>test</b> <b>balloon</b> flight to directly validate our background predictions and guide the development of a full-scale instrument...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} whether a continuous time estimation task during test occlusions of either internal carotid artery would increase the ability to detect the earliest signs of cerebral ischaemia in the anterior circulation. METHODS [...] Four patients were involved in real time measurement of their timing accuracy before, during, and after each test occlusion. While under each test condition, patients were instructed to press a mouse button connected to a computer and then to press it again no sooner than 10 seconds from the previous response but no longer than 13 seconds later. While being given automated feedback on accuracy, patients were instructed to continually press the mouse on the target schedule to maximise correct responses until told to stop. RESULTS [...] The data showed deterioration of timing accuracy during carotid occlusion (P < 0. 05), which always preceded the onset of physical signs and correlated in one patient {{with the presence of}} reduced regional cerebral blood flow. CONCLUSION [...] Decline of sustained attention under conditions of <b>test</b> <b>balloon</b> occlusion of either internal carotid artery was an indicator of failure to maintain adequate cerebral blood flow to sustain normal neurological function. The demonstration of the behavioural effects of early cerebral ischaemia shows the feasibility of an experimental model for the study of human brain function, and may now make it possible to quantify more precisely the time course of acute ischaemic events...|$|R
