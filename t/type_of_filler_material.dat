40|$|Abstract. Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) is {{the welding}} process which {{requires}} high heating input during the process. The high heating input {{coupled with a}} non-uniform temperature gradient during the cooling down process causes the occurrence of residual stresses. The residual stresses have a direct effect on the fatigue life of the material. The residual stresses can be measured non-destructively by an X-ray diffraction (XRD) method, or using a strain gage of drilled hole {{in the case of}} a destructive measurement. A numerical method of constructing a finite element analysis (FEA) model can be used for predicting the residual stress level on the workpiece surface, obtaining from the welding process. This paper selected TIG welding conditions which can provide the highest level of tensile strength for stainless steel 304, obtained from previous study, as a condition for constructing the FEA model. The residual stresses results from the FEA predictive model and the results from XRD method were compared. In the FEA model, the workpiece, heat affected zone (HAZ), and filler metal assumed to be the same. The results showed consistent residual profile obtained from the model and the actual measurement from the XRD method, but there was some discrepancy of the magnitude of residual stress which can be due to the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> that was used...|$|E

While other pavement properties are relatively easy to acquire using field instruments, thermal conductivity needs to be obtained using laboratory measurements. A method to measure the thermal conductivity was developed by Arizona State University (ASU). In this study, this method which utilizes cylindrical specimen geometry was validated for its feasibility and accuracy. However, the effectiveness of the thermal interface <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> used to fill the air gap between the heat source and testing pavement materials has not been thoroughly evaluated. Four different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> were selected and evaluated: high pressure lithium grease, Moly-lithium grease, petroleum jelly, and Omega paste. The test results indicate that Omega paste, a silicone-based thermal grease commonly used in electronic devices, gave the highest thermal conductivity of the asphalt and concrete samples tested. This is due to its higher thermal conductivity (2. 3 W/m-K) as compared to the other three <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> tested even though the workability of Omega paste was not as good as the other three.

40|$|Soy flour (SF), a {{by-product}} of the soybean oil extraction processing, was investigated for its application in soy-polypropylene composites for interior automotive applications. The emphasis of this work was the understanding of this new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> and the contribution of its major constituents to its thermal stability and impact properties. For this reason, reference materials were selected to represent the protein (soy protein isolate (SPI)) and carbohydrate (soy hulls (SH)) constituents of the soy flour. Additional materials were also investigated: the residue obtained after the protein removal from the soy flour which was called insoluble soy (IS), and the remaining liquid solution after acid precipitation of the proteins, containing mostly sugars and minerals, which was called soluble sugar extract (SSE). Two treatments, potassium permanganate and autoclave, were analyzed for their potential to modify {{the properties of the}} soy composite materials. An acid treatment with sulfuric acid conducted on soy flour was also considered. The soy materials were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under isothermal (in air) and dynamic (in nitrogen) conditions. SPI had the highest thermal stability and SSE the lowest thermal stability for the early stage of the heating process. Those two materials had the highest amount of residual mass {{at the end of the}} dynamic TGA in nitrogen. The two treatments showed minimal effect on the isothermal thermal stability of the soy materials at 200 Â°C. A minor improvement was observed for the autoclave treated soy materials. Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy indicated that the chemical surface composition differed according to type of the soy materials but no difference could be observed for the treatments within one type of soy material. Contact angle analysis and surface energy estimation indicated differences of the surface hydrophobicity of the soy materials according to type of material and treatment. The initial water contact angle ranged from 57 Â° for SF to 85 Â° for SH. The rate of water absorption increased dramatically after the autoclave treatment for IS and SPI. Both materials showed the highest increase in the polar surface energy fraction. In general, the major change of the surface energy was associated with change of the polar fraction. After KMnO 4 treatment, the polar surface energy of SF, IS and SPI decreased while SH showed a slight increase after KMnO 4 treatment. A relationship between protein content and polar surface energy was observed and seen to be more pronounced when high protein containing soy materials were treated with KMnO 4 and autoclave. Based on the polar surface energy results, the most suitable soy materials for polypropylene compounding are SPI (KMnO 4), SH, and IS (KMnO 4) because their polar surface energy are the lowest which should make them more compatible with non-polar polymers such as polypropylene. The soy materials were compounded as 30 wt-% material loading with an injection moulding grade polypropylene blend for different combinations of soy material treatment and coupling agents. Notched Izod impact and flexural strength as well as flexural modulus estimates indicated that the mechanical properties of the autoclaved SF decreased when compared to untreated soy flour while the potassium permanganate treated SF improved in impact and flexural properties. Combinations of the two treatments and two selected (maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene) coupling agents showed improved impact and flexural properties for the autoclaved soy flour but decreased properties for the potassium permanganate treated soy flour. Scanning electron microscopy of the fractured section, obtained after impact testing of the composite material, revealed different crack propagation mechanisms for the treated SF. Autoclaved SF had a poor interface with large gaps between the material and the polypropylene matrix. After the addition of a maleic anhydride coupling agent to the autoclaved SF and polypropylene formulation, the SF was fully embedded in the polymer matrix. Potassium permanganate treated SF showed partial bonding between the material and the polymer matrix but some of the material showed poor bonding to the matrix. The acid treated SF showed cracks through the dispersed phase and completely broken components that did not bind to the polypropylene matrix. In conclusion, the two most promising soy materials in terms of impact and flexural properties improvement of soy polypropylene composites were potassium permanganate treated SF and the autoclaved SF combined with maleic anhydride coupling agent formulation. 1 yea...|$|E

Due to their unique thermal, electronic, magnetic and optical properties metal nanoparticles and carbon nanostructures catch copious applications in several fields either as individual units or as dispersed media into a matrix or host materials and polymer nanocomposites. Efforts are being made to search the most well suited material for a number of applications. Though nanoparticles and nanocomposites have answered many of the problems of the modern era, yet there is an unfulfilled pursuit in this field, resulting in the invention and development of newer material each day. The present study is yet another effort to add some useful material to the nanoscience and technology which may serve as a Ã¢â‚¬Å¾problem solver [...] Nanoparticles of silver and copper were synthesized successfully by the chemical reduction method. Three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> were used to synthesize nanocomposites; silver nanoparticles, copper nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes. Using these nanomaterials, various nanocomposites were prepared with poly (vinyl alcohol) as polymer matrix. Three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> were used in different combinations in order to obtain seven different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> composites systems. Each system was prepared with five different concentrations of the composites. Composites were synthesized in solution form and films were grown, of these newly developed nanocomposites. The detail characterization of the nanoparticles was carried out using AC Impedance Spectroscopy, Tensile testing (Tensile Strength, Young. s Modulus, Elongation at Break), X Ray Diffraction (XRD), Differential Thermal Analysis, Thermal Gravimetric Analysis / (TG/DTA), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Ionic conductivity of the nanocomposites was determined from impedance spectroscopy. All the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> prepared materials were found to conduct ionic conductivity in varying range. Nanocomposites of CNT exhibited lowest ionic conductivity while those with copper nanoparticles showed highest ionic conductivity. Overall range of ionic conductivity was found out to be of the order of 10 - 8 to 10 - 4 Scm- 1. Tensile properties were determined using Universal Testing Machine. Three important tensile properties were studied; tensile strength, Young. s modulus and elongation at break. These properties displayed an enhancing behavior with an increase in the higher concentrations <b>of</b> the <b>filler</b> in most <b>of</b> the composites. Elongation at break showed most pronounced change. XRD was used to figure out the structural changes in the prepared composites. It was revealed that most of the nanocomposites exhibited a gradual transformation from semi crystalline to amorphous nature with the addition <b>of</b> the <b>filler.</b> Thermal gravimetery was conducted in order to figure out thermal properties. The graphs of TG/DTA showed a regular pattern of decrease in mass with an increase in the temperature.

40|$|M. Ing. This {{research}} project was initiated by a well-known international company (MAKRO SA), which had experienced floor joint problems occurring in their industrial floors. Floor joint problems i. e. joint damage and spalling {{of the joint}} area result, {{from a combination of}} construction workmanship and quality control problems, as well as from operational hard wheeled vehicle loading conditions. Damaging and spalling of joint edges are general problems occurring on warehouse floor slabs because of hard wheeled loads trafficking joints. In addition, joint filler detachment from the joint wall surface looks aesthetically poor and leaves the possibility of hygienic problems developing. In the case of MAKRO SA stores, the above problems are not acceptable and should be avoided at all costs. The objective of the report is to investigate solutions {{to solve the problem of}} joint damage in industrial floors due to problems occurring in practice, as described below. Floor joint edge problems are a result of three main reasons. First, subsoil quality. The quality of the subsoil is determined by the compaction effort and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> used, which in turn determine the amount of deflection that will be detected at joint edges. Subgrade quality determines whether deflection of the top concrete layer will occur. Poor compaction and <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> contributes to excessive deflection occurring due to inadequate support of the concrete floor slabs. Water penetration through the floor slab results in the fines of the subsoil being eroded or washed out, resulting in a less dense material, which will deflect under large vehicle and store racking loads. It is concluded that good quality subsoil conditions will result in less deflection and level irregularities of the top concrete floor slab, resulting in less joint damage and spalling. Secondly, the effect of floor and joint workmanship on damage and joint edge spalling. Level irregularities occur due to poor troweling or floating efforts at the joint area. Poor joint edge workmanship results from incorrect formwork removal from the joint wall resulting in a damaged joint edge and additional spalling of the joint to that occurring from wheel load impact. Joints undergo damage as forklifts traffic the joint area as wheel load and energ...|$|R

In contrary to this, the flat lamellar geometry of the precipitated calcium carbonate resulted in the worst fluidisation behaviour, as the aeration energy was 2. 5 Ã— higher in comparison to the spherical particles.

40|$|Composite electrolytes, {{consisting}} of an organic lithium electrolyte with dispersed <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> therein, were experimentally studied concerning their electrochemical behavior. The influence <b>of</b> added <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> (isolating particles) on a liquid lithium electrolyte, especially boundary layer phenomena, {{the influence of}} surface charge, viscosity trends and electrochemical stability were evaluated. Hence, different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> silica <b>filler</b> <b>material,</b> mesoporous and surface designed silica as well as commercially available silica, were systematically deployed {{with a range of}} pore geometry, pore size and specific surface area. The crucial role of the chemical composition <b>of</b> the <b>filler</b> surface exposed to an electrolyte of 1 M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF 6) in a solvent mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethylene carbonate (DEC) at the ratio 3 : 7 was investigated. Besides different measurements (conductivity, zeta potential, viscosity, electrochemical window) and material variations, some formal considerations were done like the calculation of the conductivity decrease with volume exclusion assumptions and estimation of activation energies for the movement of the ions in solution or the number of possible adsorption sites on the silica surfaces. These formal considerations were only helpful to a certain extent. The conductivities varied much between the systems and therefore, they differed more or less from the theoretical volume exclusion assumptions. The characteristics of the calculated activation energies could hardly be linked with the measured conductivities. Most of the dispersions had the same activation energy as the pure electrolyte, when taking measurement deviations into account. The calculation of silica surface sites showed, that the number density of ions in the used 1 M electrolyte is one order of magnitude higher than the number density of possible adsorption positions on the silica surfaces in the dispersions. The conductivity decreased with addition <b>of</b> silica <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> but varied considerably for the different fillers. Due to the sedimentation of the silica, stirring was necessary whereby no particulate network was formed. Several materials showed deviations from the the conductivity trend expected from calculation of volume exclusion. Hence, boundary layer effects or interaction of electrolyte ions with the silica surface (<b>filler</b> <b>material)</b> are assumed. Accordingly, zeta potential measurements showed partially trapping of Li + ions on the silica surface dependent on the surface functionalization and therefore the surface charge. As the Li + ions are the essential charge carrier in lithium electrolytes this adsorption reaction is unfavorable. Viscosity studies showed mainly Newtonian behavior of the composite dispersions with a liquid organic electrolyte, which again proves that no attractive particle network was formed. However, the mechanical properties of the electrolytes changed significantly in some systems with the amount <b>of</b> <b>filler</b> <b>material,</b> with only little change of the conductivity. Determination of the electrochemical window showed a slight widening for one system, maybe due to special morphology of the silica material Cab-O-Sil in this work, whereby most of the dispersions exhibited the same electro-chemical window as the pure electrolyte. Within all the measurements and results no clear trend for the behavior and characteristics <b>of</b> silica <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> in a liquid lithium electrolyte could be observed. The conductivities varied between the composite electrolytes, but showed a conductivity decrease, which was stronger than the expected decrease with volume exclusion assumptions. With the used silica materials no particle network was formed, but different influences depending on the characteristics of the silica materials could be observed. Hence, one can conclude that the surface chemistry and morphology <b>of</b> the silica <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> influence the electrochemical behavior of liquid lithium electrolytes, which can be positive as well as negative. Improvement of good liquid lithium electrolytes with addition <b>of</b> silica as <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> did only lead to marginal changes in this work.

In order to get composite resin restoration with appropriate modulus of elasticity the necessary knowledge about the effect <b>of</b> different <b>filler</b> particle is required...|$|R

40|$|This paper treats welding of {{tailored}} blanks made {{of different}} materials. In general, fusion welding and welding with pressure, practically without fusion, are described. Fusion welding may {{be carried out}} {{with or without the}} addition <b>of</b> <b>filler</b> <b>material.</b> In Section 3, general characteristics of tailored blanks are described. In Section 4, MIG welding and laser welding of austenitic stainless steel with ferrite non-stainless steel are described. After welding, hardness of the welded joints was measured. The welded joints were subjected to deep drawing. At the end, conclusions are stated. Investigations have shown that tailored blanks of high-alloy stainless steel cannot be laser or TIG welded to those of low-alloyed ferrite steel without the addition <b>of</b> <b>filler</b> <b>material.</b> A suitable process and <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> should be selected. The purpose <b>of</b> the <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> is to compensate for the differences in chemical and physical properties of both materials...|$|R
40|$|A {{strategy}} {{to increase the}} amount of materials available for additive manufacturing platforms such as material extrusion 3 D printing (ME 3 DP) is the creation of printable thermoplastic composites. Potential limiters to the incorporation <b>of</b> <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> into a thermoplastic resin include agglomeration <b>of</b> the <b>filler</b> <b>materials,</b> which can compromise the mechanical properties of the material system and a static morphology <b>of</b> the <b>filler</b> <b>material.</b> A potential solution to these issues is the use <b>of</b> <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> with low glass transition temperatures allowing for a change in morphology during the extrusion process. Here, we successfully demonstrate the drawing of phosphate glass particles into a wire-like morphology within two polymeric systems: (1) a rubberized acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) blend and (2) polylactic acid (PLA). After applying a normalization process to account for the effect of air gap within the 3 D printed test specimens, an enhancement in the mechanical properties was demonstrated where an increase in strength was as high as 21 % over baseline specimens. Scanning electron microanalysis was used to characterize the fracture surface and wire drawing efficacy. Factors affecting the ability to achieve wire drawing such as polymer viscosity and print temperature are also highlighted...|$|R
