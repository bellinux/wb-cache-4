5|$|The Anglo-American {{immigrants}} {{residing in}} newly-independent Texas overwhelmingly desired immediate annexation by the United States. But, despite his {{strong support for}} Texas independence from Mexico, then-President Andrew Jackson delayed recognizing the new republic until {{the last day of}} his presidency to avoid raising the issue during the 1836 general election.

5|$|The {{success of}} the 2004 team and the efforts during the {{off-season}} fueled anticipation by sports writers <b>that</b> <b>Texas</b> would play for the national championship if they could win their away game against Ohio State University and end their five-game losing streak against Oklahoma.

5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1843 Sam Houston's Texas {{administration}} had returned to negotiations with the Mexican government to consider a rapprochement that would permit Texas self-governance, possibly as a state of Mexico, with Great Britain acting as mediator. Texas officials felt compelled {{by the fact that}} the Tyler administration appeared unequipped to mount an effective campaign for Texas annexation. With the 1844 general election in the United States approaching, the leadership in both the Democratic and Whig parties remained unequivocally anti-Texas. Texas-Mexico treaty options under consideration included an autonomous Texas within Mexico's borders, or an independent republic with the provision <b>that</b> <b>Texas</b> should emancipate its slaves upon recognition.|$|E

5|$|France {{formally}} relinquished {{its claim}} to its region of Texas in 1762, when French Louisiana was ceded to the Spanish Empire. The inclusion of Spanish Louisiana into New Spain meant <b>that</b> <b>Texas</b> was no longer essentially a buffer province. The easternmost Texas settlements were disbanded, with the population relocating to San Antonio. However, in 1799 Spain gave Louisiana back to France, and in 1803 Napoléon Bonaparte (and France) sold the territory, known as the Louisiana Purchase, to the United States. U.S. President Thomas Jefferson insisted that the purchase included all land {{to the east of}} the Rocky Mountains and {{to the north of the}} Rio Grande, although its large southwestern expanse was within New Spain. The dispute was not resolved until the Adams–Onís Treaty compromise in 1819, when Spain ceded Spanish Florida to the United States in return for recognition of the Sabine River as the eastern boundary of Spanish Texas and western boundary of the Missouri Territory. The U.S. claims on the vast Spanish territories west of the Sabine River into Santa Fe de Nuevo México province (New Mexico).|$|E

25|$|By residents, {{the state}} is {{generally}} divided into North Texas, East Texas, Central Texas, South Texas, West Texas (and sometimes the Panhandle), {{but according to the}} Texas Almanac, Texas has four major physical regions: Gulf Coastal Plains, Interior Lowlands, Great Plains, and Basin and Range Province.

25|$|In fiveof {{the first}} sevenseasons under Brown, the Longhorns {{were all but}} {{eliminated}} from either of these two goals due to losses in October to Big 12 rival Oklahoma. Since the twoteams played in the same division of the Big 12, a loss by Texas to Oklahoma meant <b>that</b> <b>Texas</b> could not win the south division of the conference unless Oklahoma lost at least two conference games. However, in 1999 Brown led Texas to their second Big 12 title game where they were beaten by a higher ranked Nebraska team that they had beaten earlier in the year. In 2001, Brown took Texas to their 3rd Big 12 title game. In that year's campaign, the Longhorns lost to the Sooners, but were given another chance when the Sooners lost to both Nebraska and Oklahoma State. Texas lost the Big 12 Championship Game to Colorado, a school they had beaten by a substantial margin earlier in the year. Many felt <b>that</b> <b>Texas</b> would have played in the BCS Championship game had they beaten Colorado. A similar opportunity presented itself in 2002. After Oklahoma beat Texas, they lost to Texas A and Oklahoma State. However, Texas suffered a loss to Texas Tech, so they {{did not make the}} championship game.|$|E
