5|$|The lack {{of flight}} {{recorder}} data for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> {{minutes of the}} flight added significant complexity to the investigation and was {{a major factor in}} its lengthy duration. The Transportation Safety Board team had to reconstruct <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> minutes of flight entirely from the physical evidence. As the aircraft was broken into 2 million pieces by the impact, this process was time-consuming and tedious. The investigation became the largest and most expensive transport accident investigation in Canadian history, costing C$57 million (US$48.5 million) over five years.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{failed to}} qualify for the first two UEFA European Championships in 1984 and 1987.

5|$|The {{first film}} has around 540 effect shots, the second 799, {{and the third}} 1,488 (2,730 in total). The total {{increases}} to 3,420 with the extended editions. 260 visual effect artists began work on the series, and the number doubled by The Two Towers. The crew, led by Jim Rygiel and Randy Cook, worked long hours, often overnight, to produce special effects within a short space of time. Jackson's active imagination was a driving force. For example, several major shots of Helm's Deep were produced within <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> weeks of post-production of The Two Towers, and the same happened again within <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> weeks on The Return of the King.|$|E

During the extra period Wigan took a 2–1 lead, but Gillingham scored two goals in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> minutes through substitutes Steve Butler and Andy Thomson to win 3–2. Gillingham thus gained promotion to the second tier of English football for the first time in the club's 107-year history, in what proved to be manager Peter Taylor's final match in charge.|$|E

Smith recorded 24receptions for 336yards and twotouchdowns. In its midseason report, The Baltimore Sun credited Smith for often giving an inconsistent Maryland team good field position with his long kick returns.|$|E
5|$|The Gita {{consists}} of 18 chapters and 700 shlokas (verses), with each chapter named as a different yoga, thus delineating eighteen different yogas. Some scholars divide the Gita into three sections, {{with the first}} six chapters with 280 shlokas dealing with Karma yoga, the middle six containing 209 shlokas with Bhakti yoga, and <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> chapters with 211 shlokas as Jnana yoga; however, this is rough because elements of karma, bhakti and jnana are found in all chapters.|$|E

5|$|This {{was the end}} of U.S. air support, {{the last}} American {{aircraft}} departing Cambodian airspace on 15 August.

5|$|A {{key feature}} of the Cadet Nurse Corps program was its {{accelerated}} training curricula. Participating schools of nursing were required to compress the traditional nursing program of 36 months to 30 months. They were also bound to provide the students with the four clinical experiences of medical, surgical, obstetrics, and pediatrics. The students became senior cadets in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> months before graduation, requiring them to serve in a federal or civilian hospital. They rendered full-time service equivalent {{to that of a}} graduate nurse. During their first nine months of service, the cadets were protected by regulation from working on the wards for more than 24 hours each week. Junior cadets typically worked between 40 and 48 hours each week, including classes. Senior cadets were free of classes. All State Boards of Nursing modified their regulations to agree with the accelerated program.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{was traded}} to the St. Louis Browns in August 1888, having already {{registered}} 14 wins for the Colonels that year. He earned 11 more wins in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> weeks of the season. He struck out 176 batters and registered a 2.19 earned run average that season, good for fifth among the league's pitchers. The Browns finished 1888 with a fourth consecutive league pennant. However, not long after Chamberlain joined the club, pitcher Nat Hudson left the team to get married. In the World Series, the Browns had only Chamberlain and pitcher Silver King to face a trio of New York Giants pitchers that included future Hall of Famer Tim Keefe.|$|E

Pollard's best season statistically was in 1952, when, in 12 games, he rushed for 186 yards and his sole touchdown in the NFL, received eight passes for 59 yards, recovered three fumbles, and returned 28 kickoffs for 528 yards. In 1953, he played in 12 games which saw him rush for 44 yards and receive for 33, recover three fumbles, gain 106 yards in 20 punt returns, and gain 150 yards in 13 kickoff returns.|$|E

5|$|Four county matches {{remained}} {{before the}} Tests, giving the players more chances to press their claims for selection. Johnston was recalled for Australia'a first non-victory of the tour, which was against Lancashire. After {{the first day}} was washed out, Johnston made 24 in a 25-run ninth-wicket partnership with wicket-keeper Ron Saggers, which took Australia from 8/170 to 9/195. The tourists were eventually bowled out for 204. During his innings, Johnston swung lustily and hit three sixes. In reply, Lancashire reached 4/144 before Johnston took five of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> wickets to help dismiss the home side for 182, securing a slender lead for the tourists. Johnston ended with 5/49 from 29 overs, the most {{by any of the}} Australians, and was not required to bat in the second innings.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the trade}} proved highly {{beneficial}} for Robertson. After being stuck with an under-performing team <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> years, he now was paired with the young Lew Alcindor, who would years later become the all-time NBA scoring leader as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. With Alcindor in the low post and Robertson running the backcourt, the Bucks charged to a league-best 66–16 record, including a then-record 20-game win streak, a dominating 12–2 record in the playoffs, and crowned their season with the NBA title by sweeping the Baltimore Bullets 4–0 in the 1971 NBA Finals. For {{the first time in}} his career, Robertson had won an NBA championship.|$|E
