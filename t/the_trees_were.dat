5|$|In May 2000, twenty {{trees were}} planted, {{one for each}} boys who attended. During the {{planting}} ceremony, the Scout Chief Commissioner for England, along {{with representatives of the}} Scouts and the Guides, planted the trees on the seaward side of the original site. <b>The</b> <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> designed to act as a permanent memorial to the camp, as well as providing a series of future windbreaks against coastal winds.|$|E
5|$|Emerald ash borer {{primarily}} infest and {{can cause}} significant damage to ash species including green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), black ash (Fraxinus nigra), white ash (Fraxinus americana), and blue ash (Fraxinus quadrangulata) in North America. In Europe, Fraxinus excelsior is the main ash species colonized by EAB. Ash susceptibility can vary due to the attractiveness of chemical volatiles to adults, or the ability of larvae to detoxify phenolic compounds. Emerald ash borer has also been found infesting white fringe tree in North America, which is a non-ash host, but {{it is unclear whether}} <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> healthy when first infested, or were already in decline due to drought.|$|E
5|$|On January 12, 1999, the {{spotlights}} {{surrounding the}} Peace Candle were accidentally turned on, {{and the heat}} from the lights ignited a fire among several of the Christmas trees surrounding the structure. Several residents called police and sprayed the flames with fire extinguishers until city firefighters arrived to put out the blaze. Although flames reached as high as 30 feet, only <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> damaged and the Peace Candle itself was undamaged. The incident spurred discussion about removing the trees altogether, but Easton officials insisted the fire was just a fluke accident. New spotlights were installed in 2000, which lit the candle from top to bottom and focused on the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E
5000|$|Hyperion was {{discovered}} August 25, 2006, by naturalists Chris Atkins and Michael Taylor. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> verified as standing 115.55 m tall by Stephen Sillett. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> {{found in a}} remote area of Redwood National and State Parks purchased in 1978. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> located at 41.20491 N and 124.01556 W, near Tom McDonald Creek and is accessible from <b>the</b> Tall <b>Trees</b> trailhead. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> estimated to contain [...] of wood. Sillett estimates <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> to <b>be</b> 600 years old while others report it to be roughly 700-800 years old.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> {{listed in}} <b>the</b> National Register of Historic Places under Criterion A, with NRIS number 76001576. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> {{placed in a}} Historic Preservation Zone at 18th Street and Cheyenne Avenue in Tulsa, Oklahoma in January, 1992. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> still living in 2014.|$|R
50|$|Another {{example is}} of a birds nest in a <b>tree.</b> <b>The</b> bird <b>is</b> benefitting because <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> giving <b>the</b> bird shelter and <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> not getting {{anything}} in return.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the centuries}} the frescoes were greatly altered and damaged. In 1746 the upper levels were painted {{over by the}} artist Vincenzo Meucci, {{covering}} up most of Masolino's work. Then, in 1771, the church was ruined by fire. The Brancacci Chapel, though structurally undamaged by the fire, suffered great damages to its frescoes. It {{was not until the}} years 1981–1990 that a full-scale restoration of the chapel was undertaken, restoring the frescoes to approximately their original state. The paintings had suffered some irreparable damage though, particularly the parts that were painted a secco: in The Tribute Money, the leaves on <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> gone, while Christ's robe had lost much of its original azure brilliance.|$|E
5|$|Frederick's army became {{bogged down}} in the Reppen Forest. The day was already hot and sultry, and the men were already tired. <b>The</b> <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> thick and the ground was {{unstable}} and oozy in some parts, which made {{the movement of the}} heavy guns difficult. Delay after delay slowed them down. The carriages pulling the biggest guns, traveling with the bulk of the army, were too wide to cross the narrow forest bridges and the columns had to be reshuffled in the woods. The Russians could hear them, but thought they were scouting parties, albeit noisy ones; they calculated Finck's column was the primary force. Between 5:00 am. and 6:00 am., only Finck's demonstrating corps, to the north by Trettin, were visible to the Russians. Finck's right wing moved out of the hills toward the mill on Hühner Fleiss; more Prussians from Finck's left and center prepared to attack the Walkberge. Finck's artillery awaited Frederick's signal, but the bulk of Frederick's army still crashed about in the woods.|$|E
5|$|In June 2007, {{they shot}} the bridge battle near Bovec in the Soča Valley, Slovenia. The {{location}} {{was chosen for}} its resemblance to New Zealand. A large bridge was built, which was modelled on the one Julius Caesar built to cross the Rhine. Whereas Caesar supposedly built his bridge in ten days, the filmmakers had around forty. The schedule was short though, but the authorities would only allow them this build time to not completely disrupt normal summer activities on the lake. The filmmakers made a trench to change the river's course, so they could deepen the drained sides of the riverbed so it looked like one could drown in it. The crew also cut down 100 trees for shots of the Telmarines building the bridge; <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> moved to another {{side of the river}} for decoration. The bridge stood for two months before being dismantled. As part of the clean-up, the cut-down trees and parts of the bridge were sent to a recycling plant, while other portions of the bridge were sent to the studio for close-ups shot against bluescreen.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> {{variously}} rich in tannins {{that are}} of some antimicrobial interest. Some parts of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>are</b> used in regional traditional medicine.|$|R
5000|$|In the 20th century, {{during the}} {{construction}} boom in Bratislava, {{the area of}} <b>the</b> linden <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> endangered. In 1982, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> proclaimed to <b>be</b> a preserved <b>tree.</b> <b>The</b> area <b>was</b> protected by fencing which enabled huge boughs to grow. Today the holes in <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> evidence of it. <b>The</b> linden <b>tree</b> however deprecated and today survived just as a remainder. In the 1990s its protection was cancelled. In 2003, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> designated as <b>the</b> <b>Tree</b> - <b>the</b> Hero of the year 2003. <b>The</b> Bratislava <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> being {{referred to as the}} [...] "Palffy´s tree" [...] because it was displayed so in one masterpiece from 18th century. Referring to existing historical documents, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> can <b>be</b> proven to be at least 236 years old. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> could <b>be</b> even older because no data is kept to prove whether <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> not in <b>the</b> past a <b>tree</b> connected and being part of [...] "Prepost" [...] gardens and maybe even the remainder of the original primeval forests of the Small Carpathian Mountains.|$|R
5|$|The cyclone inflicted heavy citrus losses, {{and one-third}} of <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> uprooted in many groves. Agricultural losses reached $20 million (1949 USD), {{including}} 14 million boxes of fruit. Wind gusts of 75mph (120km/h) affected Clermont, and numerous central Florida communities reported severe {{damage from the}} winds. The observation station at Archbold Biological Station reported peak wind gusts of 110mph (175km/h); the town of Sebring reported 125mph (205km/h) gusts, which caused damage to trees and severe structural damage to buildings. Estimations of property damage reached $100,000 (1949 USD) in the town, and local citrus groves estimated losses near $2,000,000 (1949 USD). Buildings received considerable damage in the Lake Placid area, and telegraph, telephone, rail, and bus services were disrupted. Flooding affected Georgia and the Carolinas, although the rains alleviated drought conditions in Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, and New England. Charleston, South Carolina reported a wind gust of 80mph (129km/h), and power lines were damaged. In Maryland, damage was minimal, although trees were prostrated and electrical services were down. Two {{people were killed in}} Florida, but advance warnings prevented a higher death toll.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, actress Jane Seymour {{bought the}} house with her then husband David Flynn for £350,000. After {{spending}} £3 million on refurbishments, they undertook renovation of the house. They brought purchased furniture from Littlecote House, owned by Sir Seton Wills, as he was selling his house and there was little furniture at St Catherine's. Seymour spent summers at the house. After her divorce from Flynn and marriage to American film producer James Keach, Seymour rented out the manor as a film set, recording studio and latterly country house estate/hotel for corporate events and weddings. The English band The Cure recorded their album Wild Mood Swings there in end of 1994 and 1995; they came back {{in the autumn of}} 1998 to record most of their 2000 album Bloodflowers. The rock band Radiohead recorded most of their 1997 album OK Computer there. English Rock/Electronic Band New Order also recorded part of their 2005 album Waiting for the Sirens' Call at St Catherine's Court. The property was also rented by Robbie Williams, as seen in the first episode of MTV Cribs. In May 2007, Seymour was granted a 24-hour alcohol and entertainment licence under new UK regulations, by Bath and North East Somerset council. Neighbours complained the access lane was too narrow and the noise excessive. Seymour won the court battle, but sold the house in November 2007 to an unknown buyer. In 2009 a planning application for a two-storey extension, including a swimming pool was submitted to the local council. This was on the site of a previous orchard from which <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> transplanted. The house is now available for catered rental and weddings.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair {{took up the}} {{environmental}} cause of her birthplace, the Lord Howe Island, in 1982, when it was listed as an UNESCO World Heritage Site. Though the islanders were pleased with the heritage status accorded to the island, Sinclair was unhappy {{with many of the}} planning and management actions initiated by the Government of Australia to conserve the newly accorded heritage status, as it affected the basic rights of the islanders. Her objections were to the cutting of pine trees planted in the 19th century; she considered these trees (though not indigenous) as part of the island's heritage. When <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> being felled she threatened to lie down between the trees to stop the tree cutters. Her argument was that the trees added to the aesthetic beauty of the island. She also objected to the neglect of maintenance of embankments that were built to extend the airport on the island, as the embankments were eroding. She objected to the garbage that was being dumped in the lagoon of the island as it was causing health hazards. The management plan proposed by the government to preserve the island's heritage status envisaged restricting the tourist accommodation to about 400 and limiting the number of cars on the island to 100, which she objected for the reason that it was limiting the opportunities to the islanders who had lived there for many years. Another of her protests was on the creation of an aquatic reserve {{in a part of the}} island. She considered this action as detrimental to the fishing rights of the local people who had fished in the area for several years. All her objections resulted in the Ministry of Planning and Environment agreeing to address the issues she had raised. In 1967, she worked in the Prime Minister's Department and dealt with public relations and facilitated the Montreal Expo.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> {{not known}} (2016) {{to be in}} {{cultivation}} beyond the Netherlands. It <b>is</b> claimed <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> able to 'grow easily in all soils'.|$|R
5000|$|The {{leaves are}} used for {{ornamental}} decoration during festivals. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> a main attraction in gardens throughout India. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> can <b>be</b> cut into various shapes and maintained in required sizes. In past, the flexible, straight and light-weight trunks {{were used in the}} making of masts for sailing ships. That <b>is</b> why <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> also known as <b>the</b> Mast <b>Tree.</b> Today, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> mostly used for manufacturing small articles such as pencils, boxes, matchsticks, etc.|$|R
25|$|Norman's son Thomas Frederick born 2 June 1958 (great-grandson of Henry Nicholas) and {{his family}} still grow and sell coffee on a farm {{adjacent}} to the original homestead. Some of <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> planted in 1903 by Elizabeth Caroline Greenwell.|$|E
25|$|After {{the site}} was closed in 1920, {{the site was}} forested during the 1920s and when <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> felled in the 1960s and 1970s it was {{discovered}} that some of the buildings still remained. The chimneys and entrance pillars were demolished in 1966 as the structures were thought to be unsafe.|$|E
25|$|The tomb {{was heavily}} damaged during {{the rule of}} the Sikh Empire. Lahore's first Sikh rules, Gujjar Singh, Lahna Singh, and Subha Singh, are noted to have damaged the tomb, and planted large pipal trees next to the shrine that {{obstructed}} views of it. <b>The</b> <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> removed only in the British era.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> a major tourist {{attraction}} for {{fans of the}} film, although located on private property at Malabar Farm. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> part of [...] "The Shawshank Trail" [...] which features many of the film's iconic locations and attracts up to 35,000 visitors annually. The farm where <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> located sometimes is a venue for weddings.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> an acacia, {{lying on}} a small mound on a promontory. Despite its small size, due to its remoteness, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> an {{important}} landmark.|$|R
5000|$|In 1857 it {{was noted}} that the [...] "top half" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> broken off at about 150 feet, and that <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> hollow.|$|R
25|$|Maiden's Walk (or Lime Walk) is {{a raised}} {{embankment}} near the barns lined with lime trees starting with stone steps by the driveway {{in front of}} the house towards the woodland.

25|$|During the war, professors John Carter and Nathan Green, Jr. fought as Confederate officers. Carter was killed, but Green {{survived the}} war. The campus did not. <b>The</b> <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> cut down and fences {{destroyed}} and burned. The Confederate Army burned the University buildings, apparently because a Confederate major was offended that Black Union soldiers had used them as barracks.|$|E
25|$|Though <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> {{the hardest}} hit by their immobility, trees were afforded special status, such as the tree of life, ability to heal, homes to certain spiritual {{entities}} and ability to hear humans beings even the Pangool. They are the object of respect in Serer society. Deforestation in Serer country is almost unheard of.|$|E
50|$|Parts of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>are</b> {{used for}} dyestuff; <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> used for fodder; the foliage and seed pods make good forage for {{livestock}} and <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> stands up well to this use.|$|R

25|$|On March 30, 1908, {{following}} a proclamation by Virginia Governor Claude A. Swanson, Miss Randolph founded the first Arbor Day Program in Virginia. She and her students planted twelve sycamore trees. Some {{of the trees}} remain standing as living monuments, but over the years, some of <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> lost to disease. In 1976, the remaining ones were named the first notable trees in Virginia by the National Park Service.|$|E
25|$|The {{main cause}} for the {{founding}} and subsequent development of Saginaw was the large demand for lumber as the United States expanded westward. A virgin growth forest principally consisting of white pine trees covered most of Michigan. The convenient access to transportation provided by the Saginaw River and its numerous tributaries fueled a massive expansion in population and economic activity. As <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> being cut down in the region, logs were floated down the rivers to sawmills located in Saginaw, destined to be loaded onto ships and later railroad cars.|$|E
