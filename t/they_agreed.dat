5|$|By January 1831 Balzac had {{generated}} enough {{interest in}} his idea to secure a contract with publishers Charles Gosselin and Urbain Canel. <b>They</b> <b>agreed</b> on 750copies of an octavo edition, with a fee of 1,125francs paid to the author upon receipt of the manuscript– by mid-February. Balzac delivered the novel in July.|$|E
5|$|Francis, {{convinced}} that he would regain his freedom if he could obtain a personal audience with Charles, pressed d'Avalos and Lannoy, who had intended to transport the king to the Castel Nuovo in Naples, {{to send him to}} Spain instead. Concerned by Bourbon's scheming, <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> and Francis arrived in Barcelona on 12 June.|$|E
5|$|He {{also ordered}} the {{destruction}} of any remaining pagan idols in Eastern Arabia. The last city to hold out against the Muslims in Western Arabia was Taif.

50|$|The next day, Peter {{takes his}} {{observations}} to Lois who dismisses his concerns {{since he was}} bitten.

5|$|Set {{to become}} {{unrestricted}} free agents on 1 July 2009, Daniel and Henrik began {{negotiating with the}} Canucks in the off-season and {{were reported to have}} asked for 12-year, $63 million contracts in mid-June. With free agency looming, Canucks General Manager Mike Gillis visited the Sedins in Sweden, where <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> on identical five-year, $30.5 million contracts on 1 July.|$|E
5|$|The Convention {{agreed on}} several principles. Most importantly, <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> that the Convention should go beyond its mandate merely {{to amend the}} Articles of Confederation, and instead should produce a new {{constitution}} outright. While some delegates thought this illegal, the Articles of Confederation were closer to a treaty between sovereign states than they were to a national constitution, so the genuine legal problems were limited. Another principle <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> on was that the new government would have all {{the powers of the}} Confederation Congress, plus additional powers over the states. Once agreeing on these principles, the Convention voted on the Virginia plan and signaled their approval for it. Once this was done, they began modifying it.|$|E
5|$|The Soviets {{ultimately}} sentenced Powers to {{a decade}} in prison. Working with lawyer James B. Donovan, Miskovsky negotiated with Soviet representatives. Eventually, <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> upon a trade: Gary Powers would be released in exchange for Soviet spy Rudolf Abel held by the United States. Both sides agreed and Powers was released in 1962.|$|E
2500|$|The treaty {{holds that}} {{subjects}} of the two nations are permitted to trade in territories of British India, Ceylon and modern-day Indonesia and Malaysia {{on the basis of}} [...] "most favoured nation" [...] but must obey local regulations.

5|$|The Young {{brothers}} {{decided to}} abandon the glam rock image which had already been adopted by Melbourne band The Skyhooks and pursue a harder blues-rock sound. To this end <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> that Evans was not a suitable frontman for the group. Around this time, they also moved their base to Melbourne, where they frequently played at the Hard Rock.|$|E
5|$|A less {{contentious}} standoff {{also occurred}} when settlers sent by William Penn sought to establish {{what is now}} Burlington, New Jersey. Andros insisted they {{had no right to}} settle there without the duke's permission, but agreed to allow their settlement after <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> to receive commissions falling under the authority of the New York gubernatorial administration. This situation was permanently resolved in 1680 when York renounced in favor of Penn his remaining claims to West Jersey.|$|E
5|$|According to Ian Smith's memoirs, Van der Byl {{organised}} {{a meeting}} between Ian Smith and Lieutenant-General Peter Walls, Commander of the Rhodesian Army, shortly before the first Zimbabwean elections in February 1980, where <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> a strategy to prevent Robert Mugabe winning. They met again on 26 February the day before polling began in the Common Roll election. The consensus at this meeting was that Abel Muzorewa's interim government would win enough seats, when put together with the 20 seats reserved for whites which were all Rhodesian Front, to deny Mugabe victory. However, the early election results in March dented this confidence.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, three doctors {{involved}} in Smith's treatment during her incarceration challenged {{the expansion of}} the inquest to include events that took place outside the province of Ontario. Presiding Coroner Dr. Carlisle dismissed this motion {{at the same time as}} that of the Correctional Service of Canada motion, but subsequently granted the out-of-province doctors standing at the inquest when <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> to testify voluntarily at the inquest proceedings.|$|E
5|$|After more arguing {{between the}} senior officers, <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> that Khánh, Minh, and Khiêm would rule as a triumvirate for two months, {{until a new}} {{civilian}} government could be formed. However, because of their disunity, the trio did little. Khánh dominated the decision-making and sidelined Khiêm and Minh. The US military commander in Vietnam William Westmoreland deplored the concessions Khánh made to political opponents and lobbied Washington for permission to attack North Vietnam, saying that Khánh could not survive without it.|$|E
5|$|Around 376BC, Timanoridas of Corinth and Eukrates of Lefkada paid thirty minae to {{purchase}} Neaira from Nikarete, {{at the high}} end of prices for hetaerae. When the men married, <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> to let Neaira buy her freedom for twenty minae, which, with the aid of gifts and loans from her former customers, she did. As part of this deal, Neaira agreed to no longer work as a prostitute in Corinth, and so left the city for Athens with Phrynion, who had helped her buy her freedom.|$|E

5|$|As both Manchester United and Bayern Munich {{traditionally}} wore red {{as their}} primary kit colour, UEFA regulations would normally have required both teams to wear their change kits. However, the two clubs felt {{it would have been}} a shame for neither to wear their traditional colours, and <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> to toss a coin to see who would have first choice. Manchester United won the toss and therefore wore their usual European colours of red shirts, white shorts and white socks, while Bayern wore silver shirts, shorts and socks, all with maroon trim.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} February, Bothwell was {{generally}} believed to be guilty of Darnley's assassination. Lennox, Darnley's father, demanded that Bothwell be tried before the Estates of Parliament, to which Mary agreed, but Lennox's request for a delay to gather evidence was denied. In the absence of Lennox, and with no evidence presented, Bothwell was acquitted after a seven-hour trial on 12 April. A week later, Bothwell managed to convince {{more than two dozen}} lords and bishops to sign the Ainslie Tavern Bond, in which <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> to support his aim to marry the queen.|$|E
5|$|Director Michael Mayer {{heard the}} album and {{expressed}} an interest in adapting it for the stage. When he approached the band regarding a collaboration, <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> to work with him. The band also gave Mayer a wide latitude for his adaptation after seeing his earlier work in Spring Awakening. Though additional songs were included from the Green Day catalog, Mayer added very little dialogue to the show. He felt instead that the music and lyrics were expressive enough on their own, and even removed some of the dialogue {{that was part of the}} Berkeley production before the show moved to Broadway.|$|E
