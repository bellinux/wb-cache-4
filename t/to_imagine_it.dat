500|$|The episode also {{received}} positive reviews in the United States. The Chicago Sun-Times summarised it as [...] "gay and playful sci-fi fun" [...] and compared it with Buffy the Vampire Slayers [...] "good and efficient wit", and theorised that its rising quality made it [...] "not hard <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>it</b> could be must-watch TV by season four", the Orlando Sentinel stated it was [...] "a bracing mix of campy comedy, chilling twists and sexual surprises" [...] and commented that it [...] "enlivens Saturdays", and the Sci Fi Channel, who syndicate Doctor Who, called the script [...] "excellent", commented that [...] "Marsters and Barrowman's chemistry is just terrific", and lamented {{that the show}} only airs thirteen episodes per series, {{as opposed to the}} American standard of 24.|$|E
500|$|Traditional Chinese {{literary}} criticism emphasized {{the life of}} the author when interpreting a work, a practice which Burton Watson attributes to [...] "the close links that traditional Chinese thought posits between art and morality". Since many of Du Fu's poems feature morality and history, this practice is particularly important. Another reason, identified by the Chinese historian William Hung, is that Chinese poems are typically concise, omitting context that might be relevant, but which an informed contemporary could be assumed to know. For modern Western readers, [...] "The less accurately we know the time, the place and the circumstances in the background, the more liable we are <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>it</b> incorrectly, and the result will be that we either misunderstand the poem or fail to understand it altogether". [...] Stephen Owen suggests a third factor particular to Du Fu, arguing that the variety of the poet's work required consideration of his whole life, rather than the [...] "reductive" [...] categorizations used for more limited poets.|$|E
2500|$|Christopher Shea {{wrote for}} The Washington Post that [...] "In the end, {{it must be}} said, the profusion of {{proposals}} in Nudge, however worthy, and the countless summaries of studies supporting them grow a bit wearisome. As influential as the book is likely to be, it's hard <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>it</b> pushing its way alongside Malcolm Gladwell's Blink (inferior social science, far breezier style) on the bestseller list".|$|E

2500|$|Darwin's speculations in his {{notebooks}} deepened as {{he wondered}} how instincts and mental traits were passed on to offspring; [...] "Thought (or desires more properly) being hereditary it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>it</b> anything but structure of brain hereditary, analogy points out to this. – love of the deity effect of organization, oh you materialist!", and reminded himself to read Barclay [...] "on organization!!" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "All {{the pages}} in Hecht’s papers are gripping, but the {{material}} from April 1964 is phenomenal, and it’s easy <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>it</b> {{as the basis}} for a classic Bond adventure. Hecht’s treatment of the romance element is powerful and convincing, even with the throwaway ending, {{but there is also a}} distinctly adult feel to the story. It has all the excitement and glamour you would expect from a Bond film, but is more suspenseful, and the violence is brutal rather than cartoonish." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are cases}} where, {{if the child}} is returned, the {{abductor}} will not or cannot return with the child out of safety concerns. One of the crucial problems is that, upon return to the foreign country, abducting parents lack resources to hire a lawyer to obtain protective measures against domestic violence. Another concern regarding signing the treaty is the possibility that implementing it would, in practice, [...] "tear the child away from a parent", as a primary caregiver would be unable to accompany the children to countries which have criminalized parental abduction. Colin Jones, a law professor of Doshisha University, commented that [...] "hatever the law says, it is very hard <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>it</b> being {{in the interests of the}} police and prosecutors to be seen taking crying half-Japanese children away from distraught Japanese mothers." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} {{idea of the}} company was to jump on trends raised by the major studios and start production of animation with {{two to three years}} in advance.

2500|$|Tommy Jones, {{a former}} member of the Royal Military Police special {{investigations}} branch, became well known as a guide for Western journalists and visitors to the inner German border. Although he escorted around 4,000-5,000 visitors a year along the border, he averred that he [...] "never [...] frustrated. It is important to show people this border. It is impossible <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>it</b> or to describe it." [...] Jones arrived in Germany in 1945 during the British advance to the Elbe in the closing months of the Second World War and remained there for the next 45 years. He joined the BFS in 1960, moved to Helmstedt in 1974 and became the head of the BFS in 1983, by which time it had only four personnel left. In January 1990, he was awarded an MBE and retired to become a Chelsea Pensioner. His departure was noted not just by the West Germans with whom he had worked for so long, but by the East German border guards as well; as he put it, [...] "For 16 years at Helmstedt, the East German border guards never spoke to me... All they did was take pictures of me from behind bushes. When the border was opened, suddenly the East German guards decided they wanted to try and shake my hand. But I didn't feel like shaking their hands." ...|$|E
2500|$|Darwin {{had already}} {{wondered}} about the materialism implied by his ideas, noting in his transmutation notebook [...] "Thought (or desires more properly) being hereditary it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>it</b> anything but structure of brain hereditary, analogy points out to this. – love of the deity effect of organization, oh you materialist!" [...] The letter shows Emma's tension between her fears that differences of belief would separate them, and her desire to be close and openly share ideas. Emma cherished {{a belief in the}} afterlife, and was concerned that they should [...] "belong to each other" [...] for eternity. The Gospel of John says [...] "Love one another" [...] (13:34), then describes Jesus as the Word Incarnate saying [...] "I am the way, the truth and the life: no man comes to the Father, except through me." [...] (14:6). Desmond and Moore note that the section continues [...] "Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and burned"(15:6). As disbelief later gradually crept over Darwin, he could [...] "hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of the text seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would include my Father, Brother and almost all my best friends, will be everlastingly punished. And this is a damnable doctrine." ...|$|E

50|$|Most serious, perhaps, was the {{attitude}} of the northern faction to the party's Twenty-Five Point Programme, which indisputably was intellectually confused and often half-baked. Considering the circumstances in which it was written, <b>it</b> is hard <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> that <b>it</b> could be otherwise. To Strasser and Goebbels, men with intellectual and ideological bents, the absence of intellectual rigor was a serious defect.|$|R

Respondents were asked to write all messages and information they remember concerning the stimuli newly viewed.|$|R

6000|$|The {{first part}} of this speech {{comprised}} his whole store of maledictory expression, and was uttered with a slight snarl easy <b>to</b> <b>imagine.</b> But <b>it</b> would be difficult to convey to those who never heard him utter the word [...] "business," [...] the peculiar tone of fervid veneration, of religious regard, in which he wrapped it, as a consecrated symbol is wrapped in its gold-fringed linen.|$|R
