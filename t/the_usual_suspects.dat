5|$|After {{the success}} of the first two Broken Sword games on the PlayStation, Sony {{contacted}} Revolution Software to develop a game to be released initially on the console. Revolution wanted {{to move away from the}} style of its previous projects, making a game with a secret agent theme and set in an action environment. Director Charles Cecil stated that the game was inspired by crime films such as Pulp Fiction and <b>The</b> <b>Usual</b> <b>Suspects.</b> The game engine was written specifically for the title. It was released to average reviews from critics, who praised the game's story, puzzles and graphics, but criticized its controls, action scenes and animation.|$|E
30|$|The other feature measured, {{which is}} <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> <b>suspect</b> of causing visual annoyance, is the window {{violation}}. Window violation occurs when an object with negative parallax {{does not fit}} the screen and, therefore, is cut by the screen edges.

Revolution wanted {{to move away from the}} style of its previous projects, making a game with a secret agent theme and set in an action environment. According to executive producer Charles Cecil, the game was inspired by crime films Pulp Fiction and <b>The</b> <b>Usual</b> <b>Suspects.</b> The game engine was written specifically for the title. In Cold Blood was released on 14 July and 10 October 2000 in Europe, and on 25 March and 30 May 2001 in North America for the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows. While the PlayStation version is no longer available for purchase, the PC version can be purchased at GOG.com.|$|E
5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} collaborations with Bryan Singer on <b>The</b> <b>Usual</b> <b>Suspects,</b> Superman Returns and X2, editor and composer John Ottman edited the film without a temp track, noting if {{the film was}} working well without music, it was becoming a strong product. Since Valkyrie drew its inspirations from previous World War II films like The Great Escape (1963), Where Eagles Dare (1968), Patton (1970), and Midway (1976), filmmakers initially had a cut where title cards introduced characters and their roles. When the cut was test screened with an American audience, the title cards were removed due to complaints that {{there were too many}} characters to follow.|$|E
5|$|Fox, who had {{projected}} {{the budget}} at $75 million, rejected the treatment which they estimated {{would have cost}} $5 million more. Beast, Nightcrawler, Pyro, and the Danger Room had to be deleted before the studio greenlighted X-Men. Fox head Thomas Rothman argued that this would enhance the story, and Singer concurred that removing the Danger Room allowed him to focus on other scenes he preferred. Elements of Beast, particularly his medical expertise, were transferred to Jean Grey. Singer and DeSanto brought Christopher McQuarrie from <b>The</b> <b>Usual</b> <b>Suspects,</b> and together did another rewrite. David Hayter simultaneously rewrote the screenplay, receiving solo screenplay credit from the Writers Guild of America, while Singer and DeSanto were given story credit. The WGA offered McQuarrie a credit, but he voluntarily took his name off when the final version was {{more in line with}} Hayter's script than his.|$|E

40|$|Viewing {{technology}} shocks as {{the primary}} source of business cycles has resulted in many "puzzles" or counter-factual predictions of general equilibrium theory with respect to international movements of output, consumption, investment, employment, and net exports (Backus, Kehoe and Kydland, JPE 1992). There are few puzzles, however, when aggregate demand rather than aggregate supply is the source of uncertainty. In particular, the stylized openeconomy business cycle regularities are what standard general equilibrium theory predicts once <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> <b>suspect</b> [...] fickle consumers [...] is held responsible for the business cycle. The finding that preference shocks explain both domestic and international business cycles suggests the possibility of a unified explanation of the business cycle and the seasonal cycle, as both types of fluctuations share a common source: recurrent shifts in preferences. ...|$|R
5|$|Trainspotting {{director}} Danny Boyle was the producers' {{first choice}} {{to direct the}} film. Boyle and his producer met with effects supervisors to discuss the film, {{but he was not}} interested in pursuing the project and went on to make A Life Less Ordinary instead. Peter Jackson was also approached, but declined as he could not get excited about an Alien film. In 1995, after the release of <b>The</b> <b>Usual</b> <b>Suspects,</b> 20th Century Fox approached Bryan Singer to direct. Jean-Pierre Jeunet was asked to direct, as the film's producers believed he had a unique visual style. Jeunet had just completed the script to Amélie and was surprised he was offered the job for Alien Resurrection, as he thought the franchise had finished with Alien 3 and believed that making a sequel was a bad idea. Jeunet, however, accepted the project with a budget of $70 million. He required an interpreter as he did not speak much English when filming began.|$|E

30|$|For example, {{the trend}} towards {{integration}} between diagnostic and therapeutic {{functions in the}} same medical device was {{discussed in terms of}} the required changes in the skills of doctors, with deep implications in terms of patients’ attitudes (trust), administrative procedures, doctors’ status, liability and insurance issues, and the like. From the user perspective, there will be great advantages (in the same session the disease is identified and cured), but also sources of anxiety (there is no longer a time interval between diagnosis and therapy, which could be used by the patient and her family to make an informed decision, or to take a second opinion). The identification of these problems in functional terms, as opposed to extrapolation of existing devices (with associated conflict of interests of industry involved) helped to frame the discussion in a transparent way, reducing <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> <b>suspect</b> of vested interests from the industry side, or manipulation from hospitals.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{the album}} was an {{improvement}} on the charts over their last album Rated G, peaking at 180 on the Billboard 200 and 26 on <b>the</b> R&B/Hip-Hop charts, <b>Usual</b> <b>Suspects</b> was less well received. Allmusic called it an [...] "unoriginal effort" [...] and said [...] "Usual Suspects demonstrated that in 1997 there were still many rappers who were content to offer one tired, worn-out gangsta rap cliché after another." ...|$|R
25|$|The 1995 film <b>The</b> <b>Usual</b> <b>Suspects</b> {{reveals that}} the narrator had been deceiving another character, and hence the audience, by inventing stories and {{characters}} from whole cloth.

40|$|The two {{dominant}} {{approaches to}} immigrant assimilation, segmented assimilation and "new" assimilation theories, {{have been successful}} at reporting and analyzing between-group differences in assimilation patterns. However, studies of assimilation generally do not address differences at the individual level. Current theories of assimilation cannot answer the simple question that gets {{to the heart of}} individual-level differences: how do you account for siblings in the same family assimilating in different ways? <b>The</b> <b>usual</b> <b>suspect</b> variables – parents’ educational attainment, income and occupational status, nationality/religion, context of reception and experiences of discrimination for the group in the host country – cannot address this question because these factors are the same within a family. So if those variables ultimately do not explain assimilation at the individual level, what does? We argue that peers will significantly affect variations in cultural and economic assimilation. We examine data from The Integration of the European Second Generation (TIES) survey, looking specifically at second-generation Turks across Western Europe. We find peer effects substantially affect cultural and economic assimilation, effects not predicted by either dominant theory of immigrant assimilation. We suggest that future researchers of second-generation immigrant assimilation take more seriously the effects of past and present peers. keywords - assimilation; integration; second-generation; peers; Turkish Muslims; Western Europ...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on the correlation between exports and economic development runs deep {{into the history of}} economic thought and permeates policy debates. This paper studies the microeconomic structure of export growth in Costa Rica, with special emphasis on the extensive margin of trade, encompassing new exporting firms, new products, and new export markets, as well as the unit values of new versus incumbent products. The data suggest that few new firms survive the test of exporting [...] more than 40 percent of firms exit export activities after one year [...] and this firm turnover is associated with a steady deterioration of export unit values (prices). Furthermore, most new export products are associated with product switching by incumbent exporting firms. The typical new product introduced by incumbent firms tended to be priced at about 90 percent of the unit values of incumbent products. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> <b>suspected</b> obstacles to export growth, such as the inability of small firms to enter exporting activities or to grow their exports, appear to be important sources of export growth. In fact, the smallest exporting firms experienced the fastest growth in their export values. Some of these results are compared with those from other countries that have been examined in related literature.
