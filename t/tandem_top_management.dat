40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} the study is to examine the role of <b>top</b> <b>management</b> in {{effective}} key account management (KAM) relationships, making a distinction between <b>top</b> <b>management</b> commitment and <b>top</b> <b>management</b> involvement. Design/methodology/approach – The study uses data from 304 suppliers from different sectors to test the research model and hypotheses developed. Data were collected by means of personal interviews. The survey instrument was a structured questionnaire. Findings – Results show that <b>top</b> <b>management</b> commitment positively affects <b>top</b> <b>management</b> involvement. In addition, <b>top</b> <b>management</b> involvement totally mediates the relationship between <b>top</b> <b>management</b> commitment and relationship quality. Finally, relationship quality positively relates to financial performance. Research limitations/implications – The study focuses on the role of <b>top</b> <b>management</b> in KAM. Future research that considers the <b>top</b> <b>management’s</b> role simultaneously with other internal or external factors would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the antecedents of effective KAM. Future studies can also examine the potential detrimental impact of <b>top</b> <b>management</b> involvement in KAM. Practical implications – Top managers should get actively involved in KAM. The study provides managers with guidance concerning how <b>top</b> <b>management</b> can have the greatest effect on KAM effectiveness. Originality/value – The study adds {{to our understanding of the}} role of <b>top</b> <b>management</b> in KAM. The study provides an integrative empirical examination of the influence of <b>top</b> <b>management</b> in KAM and offer insights on which ways <b>top</b> <b>management</b> determines KAM success...|$|R

This study aims to examine the effect of <b>top</b> <b>management</b> succession on share price. Past studies, which used the event-study methodology to evaluate immediate investors’ reactions towards <b>top</b> <b>management</b> succession had their observations done over limited time frame (window periods). Succession may impact the share price beyond the window period because the investors may use information obtained from financial statements to evaluate new <b>top</b> <b>management</b> capabilities. This study contributes to the literature by examining the effects of <b>top</b> <b>management</b> succession on share price at the end of financial years. Book value of equity per share (BE) and earnings per share (EPS) on share price is regressed at three different points of time; year of <b>top</b> <b>management</b> change (TMC), a year after <b>top</b> <b>management</b> change (TMC_ 1) and post occurrence years of <b>top</b> <b>management</b> change (TMC_C). Findings indicate that BE and EPS are value relevant.

Research also shows that the composition of the <b>top</b> <b>management</b> team is a key determinant as to how team members utilize prior firm acquisition experience. <b>Top</b> <b>management</b> team tenure and educational heterogeneity have been shown to reduce the likelihood of mis-transferring lessons from prior acquisitions and aid managers to optimize lessons from acquisition experience (Nadolska and Barkema 2014). Specifically, diversity among <b>top</b> <b>management</b> teams allows for sharing of different ideas and viewpoints, thorough evaluation of multiple alternatives, and effective problem detection and solution (Cox et al. 1991; Wiersema and Bantel 1992), which leads to improved team effectiveness (Gruenfeld et al. 1996). As a result, a diverse <b>top</b> <b>management</b> team can comprehensively compare various acquisitions, diligently identify the differences between them, and correctly transfer skills and experiences from prior acquisitions to current ones. Indeed, <b>top</b> <b>management</b> team diversity positively moderates the impact of prior acquisition experience on acquisition success.
