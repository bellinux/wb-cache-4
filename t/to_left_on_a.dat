50|$|After all the {{students}} are seated again the principal makes a speech.

At junior high school an underclassmen may give a speech thanking the graduating students for things like being good senpai. And this is followed by a student speech from the student president. Students may give set group speeches, as if a dialogue between the lower class and upper class.

With two down, the game was hanging in the balance as Okamoto pitched to Cabrera, even though it was only the 7th inning. Cabrera responded with a towering home run <b>to</b> <b>left</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 1-1 pitch that was hit out of Seibu Dome. It was Cabrera's second home run of the day, and it was also the second grand slam of the day in total. The slam gave Seibu a 10-6 lead going into the 8th.|$|E
