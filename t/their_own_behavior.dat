50|$|Arguably, when {{examining}} Festinger’s and Bem’s theories, Miller (1995) addresses a few curious questions: “How closely and accurately do people actually examine <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>behaviors?</b> Are both theories comparable in the degree, accuracy or level of self-awareness they require? How necessary is self-evaluation on a conscious level for {{either or both}} theories?”(p. 8).|$|R

25|$|Other early {{theories}} of cognitive inhibition focused on its central developmental mechanisms and were founded by Luria and Vygotsky, two Russian psychologists.

30|$|A key {{aspect of}} {{engagement}} is facilitating {{the individual to}} self-disclose; however {{this is a very}} natural process online, with the internet promoting higher levels of self disclosure [23]. Furthermore, online users are generally more uninhibited [23], making them increasingly subject to forms of power. Specifically, this allows individuals to better self monitor and regulate <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>behaviors</b> using self subjectification [4]. Here individuals can compare <b>their</b> <b>own</b> frameworks against those of the extremist or terrorist group.|$|R
25|$|An unusual kind {{of social}} {{influence}} is the self-fulfilling prophecy. This is a prediction that, in being made, actually causes itself to become true. For example, in the stock market, if {{it is widely believed}} that a crash is imminent, investors may lose confidence, sell most of their stock, and thus actually cause the crash. Similarly, people may expect hostility in others and actually induce this hostility by <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>behavior.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{theories}} on {{the perception of}} our own behavior. Daryl Bem's (1972) self-perception theory claims that when internal cues are difficult to interpret, people gain self-insight by observing <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>behavior.</b> Leon Festinger's 1954 social comparison theory is that people evaluate their own abilities and opinions by comparing themselves to others when they are uncertain of their own ability or opinions. There is also the facial feedback hypothesis: that changes in facial expression can lead to corresponding changes in emotion.|$|E
25|$|Emily Pronin {{has argued}} that the {{subjective}} experience of free will is supported by the introspection illusion. This is the tendency for people to trust the reliability of their own introspections while distrusting the introspections of other people. The theory implies that people will more readily attribute free will to themselves rather than others. This prediction has been confirmed by three of Pronin and Kugler's experiments. When college students were asked about personal decisions in their own and their roommate's lives, they regarded their own choices as less predictable. Staff at a restaurant described their co-workers' lives as more determined (having fewer future possibilities) than their own lives. When weighing up the influence of different factors on behavior, students gave desires and intentions the strongest weight for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>behavior,</b> but rated personality traits as most predictive of other people.|$|E

25|$|The APSAC Task Force {{describes}} how the conceptual focus of these treatments is the child's individual internal pathology and past caregivers rather than current parent-child relationships or current environment. If the child is well-behaved outside the home this is seen as successful manipulation of outsiders, rather than as evidence of {{a problem in the}} current home or current parent-child relationship. The APSAC Task Force noted that this perspective has its attractions because it relieves the caregivers of responsibility to change aspects of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>behavior</b> and aspirations. Proponents believe that traditional therapies fail to help children with attachment problems because it is impossible to establish a trusting relationship with them. They believe this is because children with attachment problems actively avoid forming genuine relationships. Proponents emphasize the child's resistance to attachment and the need to break it down. In rebirthing and similar approaches, protests of distress from the child are considered to be resistance that must be overcome by more coercion.|$|E

Peaking in the 7th-9th grades, the personality traits adolescents use to describe themselves refer to specific contexts, and therefore may contradict one another. The recognition of inconsistent content in the self-concept is a common source of distress in these years (see Cognitive dissonance), but this distress may benefit adolescents by encouraging structural development.|$|E

In Study 1, subjects' judgments of how many anagrams they were given assimilated to numerical anchors. Subjects' judgments of how many math problems they correctly solved and how many stairs they had just walked up were also influenced by numerical anchors (Studies 2 A and 3 A), and this occurred even when the anchors were extreme and nonsensical (Studies 2 B and 3 B). Thus, our first five studies showed that anchors can affect people's judgments of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> recent <b>behavior.</b> Finally, in Study 4, we tested the hypothesis that self-knowledge, despite not eliminating anchoring effects, does still attenuate anchoring. However, we found no evidence that self-knowledge reduced anchoring: subjects' judgments of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> recent <b>behavior</b> and subjects' judgments of other people's recent behavior were equally influenced by anchors. We discuss implications of these findings for research on domain knowledge and anchoring, as well as for research on the malleability of memory...|$|R

2500|$|In ancient Rome, human {{sacrifice}} was infrequent but documented. Roman authors often contrast <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>behavior</b> {{with that of}} people who would commit the heinous act of {{human sacrifice}}. These authors make it clear that such practices were from a much more uncivilized time in the past, far removed. It is thought that many ritualistic celebrations and dedications to gods used to involve human sacrifice, but have now been replaced with symbolic offerings. Dionysius of Halicarnassus says that the ritual of the Argei, in which straw figures were tossed into the Tiber river, may have been a substitute for an original offering of elderly men. Cicero claims that puppets thrown from the Pons Suplicius by the Vestal Virgins in a processional ceremony were substitutes for the past sacrifice of old men. After the Roman defeat at Cannae, two Gauls and two Greeks in male-female couples were buried under the Forum Boarium, in a stone chamber used for the purpose at least once before. In Livy's description of these sacrifices, he distances the practice from Roman tradition and asserts that the past human sacrifices evident in the same location were “wholly alien to the Roman spirit." [...] The rite was apparently repeated in 113 BCE, preparatory to an invasion of Gaul. They buried both the Greeks and the two Gauls alive as a plea to the Gods to save Rome from destruction at the hands of Hannibal. When the Romans conquered the Celts in Gaul, they tortured the people by cutting off their hands and feet and leaving them to die. The Romans justified their actions by also accusing the Celts of practicing human sacrifice.|$|E

Instead, they use the Bible to support <b>their</b> <b>own</b> misguided ideals of Christianity and to excuse <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>behaviors.</b> I plan to demonstrate that both Cartwright and Trollope—as do many people—manipulate and misquote the text repeatedly to further <b>their</b> <b>own</b> goals...|$|R
