Despite its title, The Art of War addresses strategy in a broad fashion, touching upon public administration and planning.

5|$|The {{production}} team envisioned Japanese cities as entities, who require physical agents to execute their will and regulate the activities within them. The concept behind <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> city {{is based on}} traditional Chinese medicine in which the smooth flow of a body's fluids nourishes its internal organs. The team equates yōkai with qi, humans with water, and agents of the city (karas) with blood. They integrated Celtic mythology into their concept for further symbolisms, treating the city as the male (yang); and , the manifestation of its will as female (yin). In contrast, their theory treats the humans and agents as {{the children of the}} city and its will, and classifies them as the reproduction system's five major organs. Following the team's vision, the mikuras (evil yōkai) represent the five elements in this system. This idea forms the basis of the relationship between cities and their inhabitants in the show.|$|E
5|$|The river {{flows through}} the South Downs, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and since 2011, a {{designated}} national park. There are two large aquifers in the area, one consisting of chalk, {{to the south of}} the river valley, and the other the Lower Greensand Group, underlying the whole of the river. The aquifers are separated by a Gault Formation, which consists of clay. At {{the western edge of the}} region, both the chalk and the gault turn to the north, creating a scarp slope. The base flow of the river consists of water from the Lower Greensand aquifer, and from springs along the bottom of the chalk scarp slope. These help to maintain the flows in the river during the summer months, although there have been significant periods where flows have been low, notably in the drought of the early 1990s, and again in 1995/96. These led to declines in the populations of the macro-invertebrates which are used to measure <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> river, but these have subsequently recovered. In order to monitor the hydrology, the Environment Agency has a series of observation boreholes along the valley, and maintains gauging stations at Princes Marsh, close to the source, at Iping Mill, at Halfway Bridge on the River Lod just above its junction with the Rother, and at Hardham, just before the river joins the Arun.|$|E

50|$|An {{indicator}} species has <b>a</b> narrow set <b>of</b> ecological requirements, therefore they become useful targets for observing <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ecosystem.

Indicator species are monitored in an effort to capture environmental degradation through pollution or some other link to proximate human activities. Monitoring an {{indicator species}} is a measure to determine if there is a significant environmental impact that can serve to advise or modify practice, such as through different forest silviculture treatments and management scenarios, or to measure the degree <b>of</b> harm that <b>a</b> pesticide may impart on <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ecosystem.|$|R
500|$|Women's {{experience}} {{of health and}} disease {{differ from those of}} men, due to unique biological, social and behavioural conditions.

In the United States, {{there are only two}} obligatory days of fast – Ash Wednesday and Good Friday. The Fridays of Lent are days of abstinence: eating meat is not allowed. Pastoral teachings since 1966 have urged voluntary fasting during Lent and voluntary abstinence on the other Fridays of the year.

2500|$|The {{only known}} {{example of an}} actual {{inter-state}} conflict over water took place between 2500 and 2350 BC between the Sumerian states of Lagash and Umma.

[...] Areas such as the lower regions of China's Yellow River or the Chao Phraya River in Thailand, for example, have already been experiencing water stress for several years.
