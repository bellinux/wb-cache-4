5|$|Chatwin {{enrolled}} in October 1966 at the University of Edinburgh to study Archaeology. He had regretted not attending Oxford {{and had been}} contemplating going to university for a few years. A visit in December 1965 to the Hermitage in Leningrad sparked {{his interest in the}} field of archaeology. Despite winning the Wardrop Prize for the best first year's work, he found the rigour of academic archaeology <b>tiresome,</b> and he left after two years without taking a degree.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{served as}} {{a federal judge in}} the Southern District of New York from 1909 to 1924. He dealt with fields of common law, {{including}} torts, contracts, and copyright, and admiralty law. His initial unfamiliarity with some of these specialties, along with his limited courtroom experience, caused him anxiety at first. Most of Hand's early cases concerned bankruptcy issues, which he found <b>tiresome,</b> and patent law, which fascinated him.|$|E
5|$|In June 1933 Massey {{became an}} {{independent}} lecturer in Mathematical Physics at the Queen's University of Belfast. He {{was the only}} member of the department until R. A. Buckingham arrived in 1934. Despite having to give nine lectures a week, he found time to write his second book, Negative Ions (1938), and began working on upper atmospheric physics. Frustrated with the <b>tiresome</b> and time-consuming process of calculation, he had his physics workshop superintendent, John Wylie, build him a small-scale differential analyzer, an analog computer that could solve differential equations, for just £50. This was used to solve problems related to low temperature helium, and the photo-ionisation of oxygen in the upper atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his Shakespearean commitments, Hordern joined the St Pancras People's Theatre, a London-based company partly funded by the theatrical manager Lilian Baylis. Hordern enjoyed his time there, despite the <b>tiresome</b> commute between Sussex and London, and stayed with the company for five years. By the end of 1936 {{he had left his}} sales job in Beaconsfield to pursue a full-time acting career. He moved into a small flat at Marble Arch and became one of the many jobbing actors eager {{to make a name for}} themselves on the London stage.|$|E
5|$|Prior to federation, {{the various}} Australian colonies could, and often did, charge tariffs on goods {{from the other}} colonies, ostensibly for the {{protection}} of their domestic manufacturing industries, mainly based in the larger cities such as Sydney and Melbourne. For a border community such as the southern Riverina, these tariffs were a sore burden, making goods purchased from Melbourne, the closest large city, more expensive and reducing the competitiveness of these towns supplying the Melbourne and Adelaide markets. In addition, crossing the border on the Murray River was a <b>tiresome</b> experience as each border crossing had customs posts inspecting goods and luggage to ensure all duty was paid and to reduce smuggling, a popular activity. Another item of concern was the lack of adequate river crossings. Along the Riverina the Murray was—and remains—part of New South Wales, who had no interest in assisting border residents to access goods and services in Victoria that may otherwise have been sourced from Sydney.|$|E
25|$|Another running joke is Scrooge reminiscing {{about his}} adventures while gold {{prospecting}} in the Klondike much to Donald and the nephews' chagrin at hearing the never-ending and <b>tiresome</b> stories.|$|E
25|$|In Buchwald's later years, {{his detractors}} {{characterized}} the column as hackneyed, <b>tiresome</b> and not funny. When the Dallas Times Herald canceled it in 1989, the editors {{did not receive}} a single letter of protest. By contrast, when the paper cancelled the comic strip Zippy the Pinhead, so many readers complained that the editors were compelled to bring it back.|$|E
25|$|Hitler found Ribbentrop {{increasingly}} <b>tiresome</b> {{and started}} to avoid him. The Foreign Minister's pleas for permission to seek peace with {{at least some of}} Germany's enemies — the Soviet Union in particular — played a role in their estrangement. As his influence declined, Ribbentrop spent his time feuding with other Nazi leaders over control of anti-Semitic policies to curry Hitler's favour.|$|E
25|$|Vila Restal, {{played by}} Michael Keating (series 1–4). Vila is a skilled thief, lock-picker and conjurer {{and is usually}} {{reluctant}} to risk his life. His behaviour is often cowardly, and although other crew members regard him as <b>tiresome,</b> he has a high IQ. He has weaknesses for alcohol and women, and apparently talks to himself at times. Vila is the only character to appear in every episode of the series.|$|E
25|$|His trills, shakes and quavers are, {{like those}} {{of all the other}} great singers, <b>tiresome</b> to me; but his pure melody, the simple song clearly articulated, is equal to {{anything}} I ever heard. His song was acted as well as sung delightfully; I think Braham a fine actor while singing; he throws his soul into his throat, but his whole frame is animated, and his gestures and looks are equally impassioned.|$|E
25|$|Near the {{southern}} end of Zermatt, the Matterhorn Express gondola transports passengers up to the interchange station at Furi. From here there is access to Schwarzsee via a gondola to the right, a cable car that leads on to the Trockener Steg midstation (and then on to the Klein Matterhorn), and a new gondola, opened on 18 December 2006, links Furi to Riffelberg on the Gornergrat mountain. This lift addresses one of the most persistent criticisms of Zermatt: that {{it is very difficult to}} ski the two sides of the valley without a <b>tiresome</b> trek through Zermatt between the Gornergratbahn and the Matterhorn Express at opposite ends of the town.|$|E
25|$|As for the ultra-orthodox Cubists such as M. Gleizes, {{they are}} {{becoming}} very <b>tiresome.</b> Someone who knows M. Eugène Figuière assured me that he saw a strong resemblance in M. Gleizes's portrait of that eminent publisher, who must, in that case, be made of gun-metal or some similar substance. It may be my stupidity, but I cannot understand what {{this sort of thing}} means or what the artist is driving at. There are a few other paintings which may, presumably, be called Cubist in default of any better name, which are merely patterns in bright colours, such as M. Picabia's and M. Metzinger's. One of M. Metzinger's pictures is a puzzle made up of a leg, an arm, a hat, a parasol, and various other objects, and is called En Canot. These patterns have certain decorative qualities and might do for a carpet or a hanging, but they are absurd in frames, and it is a mere affectation to give them titles.|$|E
25|$|The critics {{generally}} {{agreed on the}} improved quality for the third year, but the overall ratings fell notably from previous seasons. Due to complications from her pregnancy, Marcia Cross was put on bed rest. After filming one episode from her own personal bedroom {{she was forced to}} take maternity leave with eight episodes of season three still remaining. It was predicted that the ratings would be down by over 25% since the premiere year. However, for the last three episodes of the season, the rating turned somewhat, and the season ended up with 17.5 million viewers, falling from number four to number ten on the list of most watched shows. While Cross' departure allowed for the much-underused Edie to have more story, fans noticed a decline in the stories during Cross' departure. Stories such as Lynette's emotional affair with restaurant manager Rick, proved unpopular. Furthermore, Susan's contrived triangle with Ian and Mike seemed <b>tiresome</b> to many viewers, particularly in an episode where Susan is lost in the woods. Notable, however, was that the show's rating among viewers age 18–24 increased from the previous season.|$|E
25|$|An elderly cultivator, {{with several}} wives and likely several young male children, {{benefits}} {{from having a}} much larger workforce within his household. By the combined efforts of his young sons and young wives, he may gradually expand his cultivation and become more prosperous. A man with a single wife has less help in cultivation {{and is likely to}} have little or no help for felling trees. According to Boserup's historical data, women living in such a structure also welcome one or more co-wives to share with them the burden of daily labor. However, the second wife will usually do the most <b>tiresome</b> work, almost {{as if she were a}} servant to the first wife, and will be inferior to the first wife in status. A 1930s study of the Mende in the west African state of Sierra Leone concluded that a plurality of wives is an agricultural asset, since a large number of women makes it unnecessary to employ wage laborers. Polygyny is considered an economic advantage in many rural areas. In some cases, the economic role of the additional wife enables the husband to enjoy more leisure.|$|E

500|$|For {{the seventh}} season, 61% of Rotten Tomatoes' 11 critic reviews rated it positively, {{with an average}} score of 6.97/10. The site's {{consensus}} is, [...] "Increased character depth and effective world-building helps The Walking Dead overcome a <b>tiresome</b> reliance on excessive, gratuitous violence." ...|$|E
500|$|Diddy Seibels scored first. Sewanee's {{next run}} from {{scrimmage}} was another Seibels touchdown. Rex Kilpatrick had one score, and Sewanee managed three further touchdowns. One account reads: [...] "In {{spite of their}} long, <b>tiresome</b> trip, the Sewanee men were lively as school boys out for a day off." ...|$|E
500|$|Aristotle still {{represented}} {{the enemy of}} true science into the 20th century. Leroi noted that in 1985, Peter Medawar stated in [...] "pure seventeenth century" [...] tones that Aristotle had assembled [...] "a strange and generally speaking rather <b>tiresome</b> farrago of hearsay, imperfect observation, wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility".|$|E
500|$|Many years later, Thrud the Barbarian becomes Thrud the King, but {{finds the}} mundane duties of kingship <b>tiresome</b> without {{opportunities}} to fight. To put {{a halt to}} Thrud's constant mutterings of, [...] "Kill! Death! Maim! Mutilate! Destroy!", the wise men of his kingdom collect stories of heroism from around the land and read them to him long into the night.|$|E
500|$|It {{was during}} these early rehearsals that the {{nickname}} [...] "Bruce Bruce" [...] came about, derived from Monty Python's [...] "Bruces sketch". The name became very <b>tiresome</b> as the band's management continually wrote dud cheques, made payable to [...] "Bruce Bruce", as a joke. Dickinson later commented {{that he did}} not like it but considered it [...] "a sort of stage name" [...] and accepted it.|$|E
500|$|Other critics {{hailed the}} {{environmental}} perspective. Chauncey Mabe of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel calls the book [...] "one {{of the most}} satisfying environmental books of recent memory, one devoid of self-righteousness, alarmism or <b>tiresome</b> doomsaying". Tom Spears of the CanWest News Service concludes [...] "it's more a portrait of ourselves, taken through an odd lens" [...] and [...] "ometimes an obituary is the best biography".|$|E
500|$|However, some of {{the reviews}} were more negative. PALGN's Jeremy Jastrzab opined that [...] "Darkwatch gives vampires, undead, cowboys and plenty of bullets to fire. But that's about it. Otherwise, Darkwatch is a fairly {{standard}} affair that's worth a rental." [...] According to Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine, [...] "Darkwatch doesn't amount to much more than your run-of-the mill first-person shooter." [...] Eurogamer's Martin Coxall called it [...] "a generic and quickly <b>tiresome</b> shooter, with a contrived premise which, unfortunately, does nothing to elevate it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{performance}} of the song, {{along with the rest}} of the first quarter of the show, was praised by Jim Harrington of San Jose Mercury News for giving the show a strong beginning, and Gaga's vocal performance was also complimented. Mikael Wood of Rolling Stone was rather critical of the performance; Wood claimed that it grew <b>tiresome</b> quickly but praised Gaga for her energy. Whitney Pastorek of Entertainment Weekly praised Gaga's [...] "strong" [...] singing voice, adding, [...] "The girl can, and does, sing." ...|$|E
500|$|The Face magazine's witness {{wrote that}} [...] "The {{accusation}} {{that this is}} a <b>tiresome</b> Situationist gag with a whoopee cushion pay-off belittles the K Foundation's distracted message. They are not mocking any of the artists involved in the Turner or their work so much as the whole tired institution of awards themselves.... By telling us to [...] "use our critical faculties or our innate prejudice" [...] to vote, the Ks are asking: [...] "Who decides who decides?""s witness as Cliff Jones and quoted further praise from him.|$|E
500|$|In the NME, Bob Woffinden denigrated [...] "Simply Shady" [...] as [...] " [...] all the faults that clog the album". Woffinden continued: [...] "George's vocals are <b>tiresome,</b> his voice, nasal and toneless, {{seems to}} be slowing down the song; the lyrics are {{straightforward}} and dull. Also the familiar cloying punches that Harrison's own production pulls are evident. Nothing ever happens – the sound is dense, viscid..." [...] In an otherwise favourable review, Brian Harrigan of Melody Maker praised the musicianship of Harrison and the L.A. Express, and Harrison's singing on the album, but said that the song [...] "really drags on".|$|E
500|$|Some {{media outlets}} were more {{critical}} of the show. Chicago Tribune television critic Steve Johnson lamented that Goldberg [...] "settled into bland script reading that made one long for David Letterman's cranky unpredictability in the role last year." [...] He also stated that the [...] "Best Costume Design fashion show" [...] was the silliest opening Oscar production number since Rob Lowe and Snow White sang [...] "Proud Mary" [...] in 1989. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly bemoaned that the dominance of Best Picture winner Braveheart {{and the lack of}} fashion glamour [...] "had the makings of a <b>tiresome</b> evening." ...|$|E
500|$|Once warmly social with her, in the 1880s Ambrose Bierce {{turned his}} caustic pen to {{criticism}} of Coolbrith's work, and thus lost {{her as a}} friend. In 1883, he wrote that her finely-wrought poem [...] "Our Poets" [...] should have been made a dirge, as the great poets of California were dead. He wrote that the periodical she worked for should be named the Warmed-Overland Monthly because it delivered nothing new. Regarding her poem [...] "Unattained", Bierce complained of [...] "this dainty writer's <b>tiresome</b> [...]" [...] In response, Coolbrith sided with those who said his incessant needling led local writer David Lesser Lezinsky to suicide.|$|E
500|$|One {{television}} critic briefly {{said that}} What It's Like Being Alone is a [...] "weird show," [...] and simply advised individual viewers {{to see it}} for themselves. [...] If they [...] "relate" [...] to it, the critic added, [...] "a 'Yikes!' is in order." [...] Bill Brioux of the Toronto Sun commented that in combining a feel one would usually expect from Tim Burton with elements of Sesame Street, What It's Like Being Alone would probably not appeal fully to any demographic, despite its originality. [...] Additionally, he felt Princess Lucy would be <b>tiresome,</b> {{and said he had}} hoped the show were more amusing.|$|E
500|$|Gold {{hoped to}} print stories that were {{superior}} {{to what he}} described as [...] "flakes of literary dandruff" [...] about [...] "thinking machines that go insane when asked {{to solve the problem of}} man's survival ... humorless wisecrackers, hard-lipped Space Patrolmen, nymphomaniacal heroines who are snowy pure" [...] that Galaxy usually received. War and apocalyptic disaster was an especially common theme; Gold reported that [...] "Over 90% of stories submitted still nag away at ... If it weren't so <b>tiresome,</b> it might be funny to see our transitory political rivalries carried into the remotest futures". He told prospective authors, [...] "To save their time and ours, here is a partial list of overworked ideas that should be strenuously avoided": ...|$|E
500|$|The remix {{has also}} {{garnered}} positive reviews; Lowe noted that [...] "Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, and Pusha T {{make an appearance}} on a somewhat more enjoyable remixed version of [...] ", which added a [...] "nice outside perspective to the otherwise <b>tiresome</b> track". Tom Breihan of The Village Voice called the remix [...] "pretty great" [...] compared to the [...] "horrible hammering" [...] of the original song. He criticized West's lyrics, saying he was [...] "back to talking about girls on his verse again [...] {{without any of the}} humane warmth he used to sometimes bring." [...] The song was number 32 on Rolling Stones list of the 100 Best Songs of 2008.|$|E
500|$|Certain reviewers criticized {{aspects of}} the {{gameplay}} {{that had not been}} fixed or altered from previous Myst titles. Computer Gaming World, for example, complained about having to hunt for the small hotspots that allowed actions to occur. A reviewer for The Houston Chronicle judged the method of traveling from node to node as <b>tiresome</b> to navigate. Another complaint was that the slow cursor animations made searching for actions occasionally tedious. Many publications noted the rather steep computer requirements; in addition to requiring a DVD-ROM drive, the game took up more than 7gigabytes when fully installed. Charles Herold of The New York Times, the only mainstream critic with a negative view of Revelation's music, dismissed the score as [...] "tediously literal".|$|E
500|$|Based on six reviews,Truth Serum {{received}} an average score of 3.2/5.0 on website Kritiker, which assigns a normalised rating out of 5.0 to reviews from mainstream critics across Sweden. Camila Astorga Díaz of the Swedish edition of Gaffa wrote that Truth Serum [...] "fulfils {{its role as}} background music while traveling", but considered that it lacks [...] "that one thing that {{makes you want to}} play repeat". Peter Carlsson of Allehanda called it a strong debut but stated that it did not help Lo to stand out from other pop artists. Svenska Dagbladets Sara-Märta Höglund compared the EP to Katy Perry's Prism (2013) and stated that, [...] "though Lo knows how to make a hit, I have wished she had ventured out on a more stripped-down production and dropped the <b>tiresome</b> drug romanticism".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. TV Squad's Michael Sciannamea gave the episode a largely positive review wrote that Michael is [...] "totally taken with himself", but still [...] "has shown us his vulnerabilities". Sciannamea noted that, by showing the audience Michael's humanity, the writers were making [...] "this sitcom so compelling". Sciannamea, however, did {{point out that}} this is the second week in a row that [...] "Pam is offended by something Jim has said or done", which in his mind [...] "will get <b>tiresome</b> quickly if it continues". [...] "Miss Alli" [...] of Television Without Pity graded the episode with a [...] "B+". Rolling Stone named the scene wherein the employees read Threat Level: Midnight as the tenth funniest in The Office's first three seasons.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the show}} did {{come in for}} some criticism. San Jose Mercury News criticized the plot and the casting saying that [...] "the storylines usually involve the {{obligatory}} three-episode-arc drug problems or lost virginity with dialogue designed to keep a dog up to speed", and that [...] "Whoever at FOX thought Benjamin McKenzie (Ryan on [...] "The O.C.") could pass for anything younger than 25 should be fired". A DVD review was critical of the repetitive plot stating that [...] "the Ryan-Marissa fol-de-rol gets <b>tiresome</b> as it devolves into relentless bad timing", while Entertainment Weekly did not think the acting was always up to scratch, stating [...] "it's unfortunate to have all this potential for arm-flinging drama invested in Barton, an actress who can be as flat as a paper doll". It was also denounced for excessive brawling and glamorizing underage drinking.|$|E
500|$|The story often {{appears to}} assume that readers are {{familiar}} with the geography and history of Earthsea, a technique which allowed Le Guin to avoid exposition: a reviewer wrote that this method [...] "gives Le Guin's world the mysterious depths of Tolkien's, but without his <b>tiresome</b> back-stories and versifying". In keeping with the notion of an epic, the narration switches from looking ahead into Ged's future and looking back into the past of Earthsea. At the same time, Slusser described the mood of the novel as [...] "strange and dreamlike", fluctuating between objective reality and the thoughts in Ged's mind; some of Ged's adversaries are real, while others are phantoms. This narrative technique, which Cadden characterizes as [...] "free indirect discourse" [...] makes the narrator of the book seem sympathetic to the protagonist, and does not distance his thoughts from the reader.|$|E
500|$|On {{the book}} Michael Jackson A Life In Music: A Life in Music, by writer Geoff Brown {{focusing}} on Jackson's brother Michael, {{he noted that}} like her brother, she can focus on problems as shown on the song, but she offers no solutions to them. The New Rolling Stone Album Guide commented that [...] "heartfelt pleas for racial unity and cloudy musings on the 'State of the World' don't obscure the pulsating beat of other songs" [...] from the album. Jonathan Van Meter from Spin was critical of the song, saying that [...] "State of the World", [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] and [...] "The Knowledge" [...] formed [...] "a Spike Lee-esque trilogy made even less convincing by a <b>tiresome</b> house music back-beat and that unfortunate, outdated beat on every fourth count". AllMusic's editor Alex Henderson called the song [...] "disturbing".|$|E
