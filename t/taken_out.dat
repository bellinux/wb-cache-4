Results showed attentional demands for the draw and <b>take</b> <b>out</b> were highest at the beginning of the delivery. Compared to the draw, a significant rise of RT was shown at the end of the <b>take</b> <b>out</b> shot. Shot success was significantly higher for the <b>take</b> <b>out</b> condition in expert compared to novice curlers...|$|R
