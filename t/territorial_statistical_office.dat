In view of the inaccuracy of recorded data from censuses and surveys several methods of estimation are used. This period was chosen because a census was taken in 1982 (Central <b>Statistical</b> <b>Office,</b> 1985) and a reproductive health survey was conducted in 1984 (Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council, 1985). The data from this period can be compared with those from 1969, when a population census was taken (Central <b>Statistical</b> <b>Office,</b> 1969), with those from 1987 when an intercensal demographic survey was conducted (Central <b>Statistical</b> <b>Office,</b> 1991), and with those from 1988 when a demographic health survey was undertaken (Central <b>Statistical</b> <b>Office,</b> 1989). I then consider fertility trends over a 20 -year period (1969 - 88).
