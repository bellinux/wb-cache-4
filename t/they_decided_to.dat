5|$|A Nightmare on Elm Street was {{originally}} {{going to follow}} the same design as Platinum Dunes' other remake, Friday the 13th, with the writers taking what they thought were the best elements {{from each of the}} films and creating a single storyline with them. Eventually, <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> use Craven's original storyline, and try to create a scarier film. That being, <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> remove the one-line quipping Freddy, who had become less scary and more comical over the years, and bring him back to a darker nature; this included developing the character as a true child molester, something that Craven wanted to do originally in 1984 but changed to a child killer instead.|$|E

But during the production of the finale <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> test that assumption, approached the network and found them supportive up to a certain limit. <b>They</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> change the final scene from Korra and Asami only holding hands to also facing each other in a pose referencing the marriage scene a few minutes prior.|$|E
