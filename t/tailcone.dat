5|$|Experiments {{showed the}} need for {{only a small number}} of design changes, mainly {{involving}} the wing profile and positioning. To improve high-alpha performance, the leading edge of the wing was drooped, especially on outer sections, a dog-tooth was introduced at about half-span to control spanwise flow, and the entire wing given a slight negative camber which helped control trim drag and pitch-up. The area rule principle, made public in 1952, was also applied to the design. This resulted in several changes including the addition of a <b>tailcone,</b> sharpening the radar nose profile, thinning the intake lips, and reducing the cross-sectional area of the fuselage below the canopy.|$|E
25|$|The captain {{escaped from}} the {{aircraft}} through the left sliding window. 18 people {{escaped from the}} aircraft from the left overwing exit. 13 persons got out through the left main boarding door. 4 people jumped from the right service door. The rear jumpseat flight attendant and a passenger died from smoke inhalation in the DC-9's tailcone; the <b>tailcone</b> release was not activated, and later investigation determined that the <b>tailcone</b> release mechanism was mechanically inoperable.|$|E
25|$|On August 12, 1977, {{the space}} shuttle Enterprise flew on its own for the first time. Enterprise {{underwent}} four more free flights where the craft separated from the SCA and was landed under astronaut control. These tests verified the flight characteristics of the orbiter design and were carried out under several aerodynamic and weight configurations. The first three flights were flown with a <b>tailcone</b> placed {{at the end of}} Enterprise aft fuselage, which reduced drag and turbulence when mated to the SCA. The final two flights saw the <b>tailcone</b> removed and mockup main engines installed. On the fifth and final glider flight, pilot-induced oscillation problems were revealed, which had to be addressed before the first orbital launch occurred.|$|E
5000|$|CA-29 Production {{sub-contract}} for wings, fins, rudders, <b>tailcones</b> and {{engines of}} GAF-built variant of Mirage IIIE; 101 airframe shipsets and 140 engines built.|$|R
40|$|The orbiter/SCA {{separation}} {{operational limits}} {{for the current}} target conditions of ALT free flights 1 through 5 are analyzed. The separation operational limits are used to verify that no separation design constraints are violated. The operational limits represent the acceptable dispersions in attainment of separation target conditions which assure safe separation. Safe separation is based on satisfying all specified separation design criteria except orbiter altitude at ALT interface airspeed. Separation operational limits are defined {{for each of the}} five orbiter <b>tailcones</b> on ALT free flight missions based upon preflight aerodynamics. The effect of carrier pilot steering compensation due to off-nominal flight conditions is determined to be within the separation operational limits...|$|R
25|$|The single {{retractable}} {{main undercarriage}} wheel is supported on a tall leg assembly which was originally built with electric actuation, {{but after a}} field landing with a flat battery caused a wheels-up landing a manual system was fitted. A rubber tail skid, capped with hardened steel, under the rear fuselage completes the undercarriage. In the original fuselage a braking parachute, used for approach control, was housed at the extreme rear, but this feature was not carried through to the replacement <b>tailcone</b> during its rebuild.|$|E
25|$|Three Nimrod {{aircraft}} {{were adapted}} for the signals intelligence role, replacing the Comet C2s and Canberras of No. 51 Squadron in May 1974. The R1 was visually {{distinguished from the}} MR2 {{by the lack of}} a MAD boom. It was fitted with an array of rotating dish aerials in the aircraft's bomb bay, with further dish aerials in the <b>tailcone</b> and {{at the front of the}} wing-mounted fuel tanks. It had a flight crew of four (two pilots, a flight engineer and one navigator) and up to 25 crew operating the SIGINT equipment.|$|E
25|$|On 3 March 2001, a C-23B Sherpa {{belonging}} to the 171st Aviation Regiment of the Florida Army National Guard was carrying 18 construction workers from Hurlburt Field (Florida) to Naval Air Station Oceana (Virginia). The pilot left the flight deck to use the aft bathroom. His weight in the <b>tailcone</b> shifted {{the center of gravity}} sufficiently (later calculations determined that the aircraft had been loaded outside its operating envelope {{at the start of the}} flight) that the airplane became unstable when a patch of severe turbulence was encountered. The violent g-force shifts then encountered rendered the crew unconscious and caused the breakup of the aircraft in flight near Unadilla, Georgia, killing the 21 persons on board.|$|E
500|$|The {{aircraft}} was designed around a French-made 12-cylinder Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs engine with a Hispano-Suiza HS.404 [...] autocannon mounted between the cylinder {{banks of the}} engine and firing through the propeller hub. This powerful [...] engine combined with the hub-firing cannon mandated {{the use of a}} metal fuselage. Other armament consisted of two synchronised French-made [...] Darne machine guns, mounted under and to each side of the engine. The wing was braced with two struts {{on each side of the}} fuselage; the fixed conventional landing gear was spatted and mounted off the wing struts. [...] The fixed tailwheel was also spatted. [...] The enclosed cockpit was located behind the wing. The horizontal stabilizer on each side was braced from below with two rigid braces from the lower <b>tailcone,</b> and tied from above with two flying wires from the vertical stabilizer. The three-bladed propeller was manually adjustable in pitch.|$|E
500|$|The OKO, {{along with}} all other {{aircraft}} designers, had been directed to use the Shvetsov ASh-82 radial engine as a backup engine for their products in May 1941, but the evacuation disrupted the production of this version, known internally as the IT {{and it was not}} built until the autumn of 1942. Aside from the engines, it differed from the T in small respects. Its <b>tailcone</b> was split vertically to use as an air brake and the armament was revised to consist of two VYa cannon in the undernose pod with 150 rounds each and four Berezin UBK machine guns mounted in the wing roots. It made its first flight on 28 January 1943 and demonstrated a top speed of [...] and a time to 5,000 meters of 6.3 minutes. Flight testing was stopped on 10 February when the floatless carburetors had to be sent to TsIAM (Tsentrahl'nyy Institoot Aviatsionnovo Motorostroyeniyaâ€”Central Institute of Aviation Motors) for adjustment. There were continuous problems with these and they delayed the entire project until it was cancelled in October 1943.|$|E
2500|$|NTSB {{investigators}} {{examined and}} tested the antiskid, autobrake, and thrust reverser systems on the aircraft. The autobrake selector switch {{in the cockpit}} {{was found in the}} [...] "max" [...] position. The <b>tailcone</b> handle in the main cabin had been actuated, presumably for evacuation purposes, and the rear <b>tailcone</b> had detached.|$|E
2500|$|CL-605: Introduced {{in early}} 2006 as an {{avionics}} and structural upgrade of the 604 design. Structural improvements include larger cabin windows. [...] Cockpit instrumentation updated with the Collins Proline 21 avionics and [...] "electronic flight bag" [...] capability. It can be visually identified by a new, rounded <b>tailcone.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Trident was a jet {{airliner}} of all-metal construction with a T-tail and a low-mounted wing with a quarter-chord sweepback of 35 degrees. It {{had three}} rear-mounted engines: two in side-fuselage pods, {{and the third}} in the fuselage <b>tailcone,</b> aspirating through an S-shaped duct. One version, the 3B, had a fourth [...] "boost" [...] engine aspirated through a separate intake duct above the main S-duct. All versions were powered by versions of the Rolls-Royce Spey, while the boost engine was also by Rolls-Royce: the RB.162, originally intended as a lift engine for VTOL applications.|$|E
2500|$|The Alpha {{fuselage}} is {{made from}} wood, with some fiberglass components incorporated. The fuselage uses a circular cross-section from nose to tail, with the diameter varying from the [...] diameter at the tail to a [...] diameter at the cockpit. The HP-11 wing is of all-metal and features a 26:1 aspect ratio, a [...] wingspan and a NACA 65 (3)-618 airfoil. The v-tail is removable by first removing the <b>tailcone</b> and then withdrawing two pins. The controls are adapted from a Piper PA-24 Comanche. The landing gear is a retractable monowheel and a tail skid. The tail skid was later replaced with a tail wheel.|$|E
2500|$|The first Type 508 {{made its}} maiden flight from Boscombe Down {{airfield}} on 31 August 1951, with the aircraft carrying out carrier trials aboard HMS Eagle in May 1952. The second aircraft had significant differences, carrying a cannon armament and was different enough in detail to be renamed the Type 529, flying {{for the first}} time on 29 August 1952. One unusual modification was the larger <b>tailcone</b> for a proposed tail-warning radar. The maximum speed of the straight-winged Type 508 and 529 was relatively modest, with the Type 529 reaching 607mph (977km/h) and it had already been decided when the Type 508 first flew, to redesign the third prototype with swept wings to improve performance. The resulting Type 525 also featured conventional swept tail surfaces as well as blown flaps to reduce the aircraft's landing speed and first flew on 27 April 1954. [...] It later crashed but the basic design had already proved sound enough to proceed with an outwardly fairly similar looking aircraft, the Type 544, to specification N.113. A total of 100 were ordered, although the Royal Navy had changed the specification to a low level strike aircraft with nuclear capability rather than a fighter.|$|E
50|$|Another unique type of {{evacuation}} slide is found on certain DC-9, MD-80 and Boeing 717 aircraft. This type of slide {{is in the}} aircraft's <b>tailcone,</b> and deploys after the <b>tailcone</b> is jettisoned by flight attendants, allowing for evacuation through {{the rear of the}} airframe. The procedure to use this exit may involve removing a plug-type pressure bulkhead, or a swing type door that leads directly to a walkway. At the end of the walkway is the slide pack and a manual <b>tailcone</b> jettison handle for use if the <b>tailcone</b> has not already been automatically jettisoned by opening the walkway entrance.|$|E

50|$|On the B-52 SRAMs {{were carried}} {{externally}} on two wing pylons (six missiles on each pylon) and internally on an eight-round rotary launcher {{mounted in the}} bomb bay; maximum load-out was 20 missiles. The capacity of the B-1B was eight missiles on up to three rotary launchers (one in each of its three stores bays) for a maximum loadout of 24 missiles, all internal. The smaller FB-111A could carry two missiles internally and four more missiles under the aircraft's swing-wing. The externally mounted missiles required {{the addition of a}} <b>tailcone</b> to reduce aerodynamic drag during supersonic flight of the aircraft. Upon rocket motor ignition, the missile <b>tailcone</b> was blown away by the exhaust plume.|$|E

50|$|The Cygnet was {{designed}} at Slough by C.W. Aircraft Limited in 1936. It {{was the first}} all-metal stressed-skin lightplane to be built and flown in the United Kingdom. It was first flown in May 1937 at London Air Park, Hanworth. Only one prototype was constructed by C.W. Aircraft. It had a tailwheel undercarriage. It had a low cantilever wing, the outer panel of which was tapered and had dihedral. Two persons {{sat side by side}} in an enclosed cabin. The metal airframe employed a semi-monocoque <b>tailcone.</b> Atop the <b>tailcone</b> sat a one-piece tailplane, with dual fins at the tailplane's ends. The inverted piston engine drove a two-blade propeller.During that period C.W. Aircraft had invested heavily in another design, the C.W. Swan. Overextended, it became insolvent and sold all rights for the Cygnet to General Aircraft Ltd in 1938.|$|E
50|$|The DG-400 {{uses the}} wings and most systems of the DG-202. It has a {{modified}} fuselage with a slightly enlarged <b>tailcone</b> and carbon fibre reinforcements to accommodate the engine, which is a relatively large unit with electric starter and electric retraction. This powerful installation, with a user-friendly engine control unit, made the DG-400 easier to operate than other self-launching gliders.|$|E
50|$|Distinctly {{identified}} by the antennae arrays on the fuselage chin, <b>tailcone,</b> and wing tips, three RC-135C aircraft were converted to RC-135U (63-9792, 64-14847, & 64-14849) in the early 1970s. 63-9792 was later converted into a Rivet Joint in 1978, and all aircraft remain in service based at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. Minimum crew requirements are 2 pilots, 2 navigators, 3 systems engineers, 10 electronic warfare officers, and 6 area specialists.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{structure}} is welded chromoly steel tubing. The forward fuselage {{is made of}} fiberglass and aluminum with a Plexiglas canopy. The <b>tailcone</b> and vertical and horizontal stabilizers are aluminum. It has an enclosed cabin with side-by-side seating for a pilot and passenger. The doors may be removed for flight, as is often done for photographic flights, interior cooling in high temperatures, or a 10.4 lb weight saving.|$|E
50|$|The Nimrod R1 was {{primarily}} based around the standard Nimrod MR1 airframe, {{with the only}} significant visual differences being {{the absence of the}} MAD boom projection from the aircraft's tail, and the presence of radomes {{on the front of the}} external wing fuel tanks and on the <b>tailcone.</b> The bulk of the aircraft's detection equipment was installed in the weapons bay, with a total crew of 25, plus five flight crew.|$|E
