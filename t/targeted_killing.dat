5|$|Nils Melzer {{presents}} an historical, legal and moral examination of <b>targeted</b> <b>killing.</b> The author observes that after September 11, the Western world grew {{more supportive of}} <b>targeted</b> <b>killing</b> than ever before. The book recounts in depth how state-sanctioned <b>targeted</b> <b>killing</b> is perceived in other countries. He defines <b>targeted</b> <b>killing</b> as the premeditated selection of an individual person not yet in custody for elimination by force. Melzer analyzes {{all areas of the}} topic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Targeted</b> <b>Killing</b> in International Law is a {{book about}} the {{legality}} of <b>targeted</b> <b>killing,</b> written by Nils Melzer. It was first published by Oxford University Press in May 2008. The book explores the history of <b>targeted</b> <b>killing</b> as a government strategy by multiple countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Switzerland and Germany; for both military and law enforcement purposes. Melzer argues that directly after the September 11 attacks in the United States, perceptions of the tactic became more positive.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} of the book for the journal International Criminal Justice Review, Robert M. Worley of Penn State Altoona {{comments}} favorably on the comprehensive nature of Melzer's research and his descriptions of the differences of the practice of <b>targeted</b> <b>killing</b> in varying countries. Worley comments on the relevance of the book to scholars in various fields, including history, law, law enforcement, and terrorism analysis. Worley concludes his review by recommending the book for those with a fascination in researching criminal justice or the law. William Abresch comments favorably on <b>Targeted</b> <b>Killing</b> in International Law, in a review for the European Journal of International Law. He writes that the book is an important addition to the field of scholarship regarding how international law governs the practice of <b>targeted</b> <b>killing.</b> Abresch calls the author's writing style logical, and praises the book's organizational structure including its separate sections on use of targeted in war contrasted with use by police.|$|E

We find, however, that intended Palestinian violence is increasing at low levels of <b>targeted</b> <b>killings,</b> but decreasing at higher levels. There is little {{evidence to suggest that}} suicide bombings against Israelis reduce the number of subsequent Palestinian fatalities. Rather, we find that suicide attacks that kill at least one Israeli lead to subsequent increased incidence and levels of Palestinian fatalities.

5|$|Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World {{begins with}} an {{introduction}} by Andrew Altman. This is followed by eighteen essays broken into five sections arranged by topic. The work says that after the Al-Qaeda attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, the US and other countries {{began to see the}} tactic of <b>targeted</b> <b>killing</b> differently. The practice of <b>targeted</b> <b>killing</b> had previously been accepted in situations of self-defense in military settings; after the attacks it was used to kill non-combatants and those not directly involved in a particular armed force.|$|E
5|$|Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World is a non-fiction {{compilation}} {{book about}} <b>targeted</b> <b>killing</b> edited by Claire Finkelstein, Jens David Ohlin, and Andrew Altman. It {{was published by}} Oxford University Press in 2012. The book grew out of contributions by the authors to a conference in April 2011 at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Targeted Killings features eighteen essays in five sections arranged by topic.

5|$|A {{review of}} the book in the Leiden Journal of International Law by Tamás Hoffmann {{recommends}} the work to multiple potential readers, including those who engage in targeting killing, academics, and students. Hoffmann calls it a well-researched monograph and helpful reference work on the subject. The review places the book {{within the context of}} addressing legal issues inherent in debating the murky concept of <b>targeted</b> <b>killing.</b> Hoffmann states the book furthers prior attempts to come to a resolution {{on the question of the}} practice's legality. Helen Durhan praises the writing quality of Melzer's work, in a review for the Australian Year Book of International Law. Durhan writes the work is organized in an easily readable format and covers the topic with neutrality. She goes on to call the book a work representing the need for concerned discussion prior to implementing any policy involved in eliminating people. Of the author's focus throughout the work, Durhan observes that the author handles discussion of the legality of <b>targeted</b> <b>killing</b> in a clear and precise manner. The review concludes Melzer's thorough analysis goes a long way towards furthering scholars' impressions of legal issues surrounding when it is permitted for sovereign governments to kill people.|$|E
40|$|Are <b>targeted</b> <b>killings</b> an {{effective}} strategy for combating militant groups? I {{add to the}} literature by accounting for variation in militant group structure and competition among militant groups as conditioning effects on the likely effectiveness of <b>targeted</b> <b>killings.</b> I do this cross-nationally by examining four cases: Colombia, Israel, Russia, and the United States (in the Afghanistan- Pakistan theater of operations). A dataset was constructed for each state’s program, containing information on militant attacks, <b>targeted</b> <b>killings,</b> and other relevant variables. Each case was examined between the years 2004 and 2011, using the day as {{the unit of analysis}} (N of 2922 observations in each case), and zero-inflated negative binomial regression (ZINB) as the statistical test. I found that the effectiveness of <b>targeted</b> <b>killings</b> was dependent upon the structure of militant groups and the existence of competition among militant groups (on the same side of a conflict). Specifically, <b>targeted</b> <b>killings</b> were less effective against decentralized organizations and under the conditions of inter-militant group competition; while <b>targeted</b> <b>killings</b> {{were more likely to be}} effective against centralized organizations that did not face competition. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent decades}} we can watch heated debates {{on the legal}} and moral {{permissibility}} of State-sponsored <b>targeted</b> <b>killings</b> involving representatives from Governments, academic circles, military and police forces, intelligence services, human rights groups, humanitarian institutions, intergovernmental organizations a and the mass media. These debates are even more intense after the killing of Osama bin Laden, leader of the terrorist group Al Qaeda, in May 2011. The aim of the thesis is to answer to the question: Are <b>targeted</b> <b>killings</b> a permissible method of fight against terrorism? The legality of <b>targeted</b> <b>killings</b> is analyzed in term of lex lata international law, namely under human rights law, international humanitarian law and law of international security. The thesis is composed of six chapters. Chapter One defines basic terminology used in the thesis. The Chapter is subdivided into two parts. Part One defines the concept of <b>targeted</b> <b>killings.</b> Part Two defines the notion of terrorism. Chapter Two examines the legality of <b>targeted</b> <b>killings</b> in term of law of international security. Chapter Three describes the parallel application of human rights law and international humanitarian law. Chapter Four analyzes the legality of <b>targeted</b> <b>killings</b> under human rights law. The Chapter is subdivided into two [...] ...|$|R
