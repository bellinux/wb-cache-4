5|$|In {{the medieval}} Japan, heian gentleman {{were not very}} {{interested}} in a woman's physical beauty and rarely {{had an opportunity to}} see it. The only physical attribute of interest was a woman's hair, which had to be thick and longer than she was tall. <b>The</b> <b>fascination</b> with long hair was one reason why a woman's becoming a nun was regarded with such seriousness— it could never again grow to its full length. This explains why Genji refuses to let Murasaki (his de facto wife in the classical Japanese novel The Tale of Genji) take the tonsure when she is ill.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergency}} room {{is filled with}} victims from a chain car accident, one of whom is admitted in the department of neurosurgery, under the care of Shepherd and Yang. As the physicians soon discover that he has been internally decapitated, they {{come to the conclusion that}} even a minor move would result in irreparable damage. A pregnant woman is admitted in plastic surgery, after having her arm severed. Meredith is assigned to work for Sloan during the day, and is immediately told to find the arm, much to <b>the</b> <b>fascination</b> of her interns. Despite trying to deal with her trainees in a strict manner, Stevens is looked upon as unprofessional by the interns she was assigned to. Her image is further deteriorated when she decides to abandon her hospital duties, in order to perform surgery on a deer, once again letting her emotional involvement interfere with her career. Meredith and Shepherd discuss the repercussions of their breakup, and realize that they cannot reconcile. However, the two engage in sexual intercourse, as a manner to express their mutual feelings for the last time. O'Malley comes to the realization of his love for Stevens, and quickly discloses to her that he shares her romantic feelings.|$|E

25|$|One {{could say}} that the anxious search for the origins of Life and Mind; <b>the</b> <b>fascination</b> in the 'mysteries of Nature'; the urge to {{penetrate}} and decipher the inner structure of Matter—all these longings and drives denote a sort of nostalgia for the primordial, for the original universal matrix.

25|$|Materials {{reduced to}} the {{nanoscale}} can show different properties compared to what they exhibit on a macroscale, enabling unique applications. For instance, opaque substances can become transparent (copper); stable materials can turn combustible (aluminium); insoluble materials may become soluble (gold). A material such as gold, which is chemically inert at normal scales, {{can serve as a}} potent chemical catalyst at nanoscales. Much of <b>the</b> <b>fascination</b> with nanotechnology stems from these quantum and surface phenomena that matter exhibits at the nanoscale.|$|E
25|$|Hovhaness was {{interested}} in music from a very early age, writing his first composition, a cantata in the early Italian style, {{at the age of}} four after being inspired by hearing a song of Franz Schubert.

25|$|Mobile oceanic {{species such}} as tuna can be {{captured}} by travelling long distances in large fishing vessels. A simpler alternative is to leverage off <b>the</b> <b>fascination</b> fish have with floating objects. When fishermen use such objects, they are called fish aggregating devices (FADs). FADs are anchored rafts or objects of any type, floating on the surface or just below it. Fishermen in the Pacific and Indian oceans set up floating FADs, assembled from all sorts of debris, around tropical islands, and then use purse seines to capture the fish attracted to them.|$|E
25|$|Carlo Gesualdo da Venosa (30 March 1566 – 8 September 1613) was Prince of Venosa and Count of Conza. As a {{musician}} {{he is best}} known for writing intensely expressive madrigals and pieces of sacred music that use a chromatic language not heard again until the late 19th century. He is also known for his cruelty and lewdness: the best known fact of his life is his gruesome killing of his first wife and her lover upon finding them in flagrante delicto. <b>The</b> <b>fascination</b> for his extraordinary music and for his shocking acts have gone hand in hand.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of the}} {{swastika}} {{was incorporated}} by Nazi theorists with their conjecture of Aryan cultural descent of the German people. <b>The</b> <b>fascination</b> of the German people with Aryanism arose when artifacts with swastikas on them were found near the Trojan city of Troy by Heinrich Schliemann. The Nazi party {{was looking for the}} symbol that would preferably catch the attention of all of Germany and the swastika had that potential. It became a symbol to unify the German people, to a conjecture about their ancestors, Aryan identity and nationalistic pride. It also allowed the Nazi party to establish their anti-Semitic views, as well as terrify Jews and the enemies of the Nazi state.|$|E

25|$|As <b>the</b> <b>fascination</b> with six-day races {{spread across}} the Atlantic from its origins in the United Kingdom, their appeal to base {{instincts}} attracted large crowds. The more spectators who paid at the gate, the bigger the prizes, which provided riders with the incentive to stay awake–or be kept awake–in order to ride the greatest distance. To prepare for the event, Taylor went to Brooklyn, where he {{became a member of}} the South Brooklyn Wheelmen. An estimated crowd of 6,000 spectators attended the final day of the Madison Square Garden races in December 1896. During these long, grueling races, riders suffered delusions and hallucinations, which may have been caused by exhaustion, lack of sleep, or perhaps use of drugs.|$|E
25|$|According to the musicologists, the Lacanist {{psychoanalysis}} of the subculture {{indicate that}} <b>the</b> <b>fascination</b> to the singer's voice (the {{lack of understanding}} amplifies the effect), as well ineffable and unfulfillable desire, are what attracts most of the (predominantly female) fans to the groups on international scale. The female fans (bangyaru) show a behavioral pattern while attending the concerts, as there several furi (movements) like tesensu (arm fan), gyakudai (reversed dive), hedoban (headbang), saku (spread hands in the air). The explicit fan fiction, and homoerotic acts on the stage by some musicians called fan sabisu (fan service; a sexual term borrowed from manga culture), {{are related to the}} Lacanian man's type of desire (to be recognized by the other, desire of the other), i.e. the female fans do not desire the musician himself, but his desire, kind of cultural social training ground for the inescapable process of learning how to desire.|$|E
25|$|Acetylcholine, once released, is {{degraded}} in the extracellular {{space by}} acetylcholinesterase, which faces that space. In the case the catecholamines, however, the enzymes of degradation monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyl transferase, like the enzymes of synthesis, are intracellular. Not metabolism but uptake through cell membranes therefore {{is the primary}} means of their clearance from the extracellular space. The mechanisms were deciphered beginning in 1959. Axelrod’s group in Bethesda wished to clarify the in vivo fate of catecholamines using radioactively labelled catecholamines of high specific activity, which had just become available. 3H-adrenaline and 3H-noradrenaline given intravenously to cats were partly O-methylated, but another part was taken up in the tissues and stored unchanged.-epinephrine and its metabolite metanephrine|journal = Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics|volume =127 |pages = 251–256}}-norepinephrine in animals |journal = Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics |volume =132 |pages = 193–201|pmid=13784801 }} Erich Muscholl (born 1926) in Mainz, {{who had worked with}} Marthe Vogt in Edinburgh, wished to know how cocaine sensitized tissues to catecholamines – a fundamental mechanism of action of cocaine discovered by Otto Loewi and Alfred Fröhlich in 1910 in Vienna. Intravenous noradrenaline was taken up into the heart and spleen of rats, and cocaine prevented the uptake, ″thus increasing the amount of noradrenaline available for combination with the adrenergic receptors″. The uptake of 3H-noradrenaline was severely impaired after sympathectomy, indicating that it occurred mainly into sympathetic nerve terminals. In support of this, Axelrod and Georg Hertting (born 1925) showed that freshly incorporated 3H-noradrenaline was re-released from the cat spleen when the sympathetic nerves were stimulated. A few years later, Leslie Iversen (born 1937) in Cambridge found that other cells also took up catecholamines. He called uptake into noradrenergic neurones, which were cocaine-sensitive, uptake1 and uptake into other cells, which were cocaine-resistant, uptake2. With the reserpine-sensitive uptake from the cytoplasm into the storage vesicles there were thus three catecholamine membrane passage mechanisms. Iversen’s book of 1967 “The Uptake and Storage of Noradrenaline in Sympathetic Nerves” was successful, showing <b>the</b> <b>fascination</b> of the field and its rich pharmacology.|$|E

500|$|Contrasting {{with his}} June olives with their blue-green color and coolness of tone, the vibrant oranges and yellows in Olive Trees with Yellow Sky and Sun (F710) evoke the fall season.

500|$|Auden's {{literary}} executor and biographer Edward Mendelson and others interpret the poem as an allegory {{of the human}} body, whose characteristics correspond {{to those of the}} limestone landscape. The poet recognises that this landscape, like the body, is not witness to great historical events, but exists at a scale most suitable to humans. [...] "Limestone" [...] questions the valuation of that which exists on a scale different from the body—politics, <b>the</b> <b>fascination</b> with consciousness, and other abstractions. The poem's ending lines, which justify the landscape in theological terms, are also a theological statement of the body's sacred significance. The poem is thus an argument against Platonic and idealistic theologies in which the body is inherently fallen and inferior to the spirit. This interpretation is consistent with Auden's many prose statements about the theological importance of the body.|$|E
