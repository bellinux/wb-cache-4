25|$|Basis risk {{is a major}} {{disadvantage}} of index-based insurance. It is <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> an individual experiences a loss without receiving payment or vice versa. Basis risk {{is a direct result}} of the strength of the relation between the index that estimates the average loss by the insured group and the loss of insured assets by an individual. The weaker this relation the higher the basis risk. It is obvious that high basis risk undermines the willingness of potential clients to purchase insurance. It thus challenges insurance companies to design insurances such as to minimize basis risk.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the {{responses}} of university students in social anxiety situations in order to create a psychological counselling program with a structured group based on Cognitive Behavioural and Existential Approaches. These responses involve the behaviour and thoughts of the university students in <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> they experience or anticipate social anxiety. The semi-structured interview form developed by the researchers was used in the study during the face-to-face interviews with fifty-one 4 th year students from the Guidance and Psychological Counselling (GPC) and Pre-School Teaching (PST) departments. The scope of the interview form includes <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> 1) students experience social anxiety in the school setting and their thoughts and behaviours regarding these <b>situations,</b> 2) <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> they anticipate social anxiety in their future profession, and 3) <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> they experience social anxiety in their daily lives. Our aim was to collect data from these areas. The data collected were analysed through content analysis.

25|$|An RCD {{does not}} provide {{protection}} against unexpected or dangerously high current (called spikes or surges) when current is in the usual wires in the circuit, therefore it cannot replace a fuse or protect against overheating or fire risk due to overcurrent (overload) or short circuits if the fault {{does not lead to}} current leakage. Therefore, RCDs are often used or integrated as a single product along with some kind of circuit breaker, such as a fuse or miniature circuit breaker (MCB), which adds protection in the event of excessive current in the circuit (the resulting RCD with overcurrent protection called an RCBO). RCDs also cannot detect <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> a human accidentally touches both conductors at the same time, since the current through an expected device, an unexpected route, or a human, are indistinguishable if the current returns through the expected conductor.|$|E
25|$|Even {{with this}} rule in effect, {{there was no}} {{guarantee}} that {{a repeat of the}} 2002 situation would not occur; to avoid future ties due to lack of available players, managers have been instructed to (and have voluntarily) hold back a few select position players and pitchers. This has resulted in some fan dissatisfaction and controversy when these players are never actually used in the game, for example Tim Wakefield in the 2009 All-Star Game. Such a move has resulted in calls to allow limited re-entry of players who have been replaced during the game (in addition to catchers, which is already allowed), thereby giving the freedom to use all the players on the roster without leaving teams with <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> no players are available, {{as was the case in}} 2002. Starting with the 2010 game, each league's manager is allowed to designate one position player who can re-enter the game to replace an injured or ejected player at any position, in addition to the existing rule covering catchers.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1950s {{there was}} an {{increasing}} demand for a diesel-engined Land Rover. Diesel technology had improved, making small-capacity high-speed engines practical. Diesel power had also become prominent in industrial and agricultural uses throughout the world, and fleet users of Land Rovers were often in <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> their Land Rovers were the only petrol-engined vehicles in their fleet, making spares, servicing and fuel supply more complex. The Rover Motor Company was in talks with Standard-Triumph in 1954, {{with the possibility of}} a merger. Standard were Britain's pioneers of road-going small diesel engines with the 20C engine fitted to Ferguson tractors and the Standard Vanguard car (Britain's first diesel car). Rover engineers were able to study Standard's diesel designs as part of these. The merger was called off, but Rover had gained vital experience and knowledge in developing small diesel engines. The result was a wet-liner 4-cylinder engine. Fuel injection equipment was from CAV, and the engine used Ricardo's Comet swirl chambers, but with Rover-developed dimples to produce quieter and smoother running. Heater plugs were fitted to each combustion chamber to improve starting. The engine was launched in the Land Rover in 1957. The vehicle had to have an extra 2inches let into the chassis in the engine bay to enable the new engine to fit. The engine's power output and speed range was close enough to the existing petrol engine to allow the same transmission unit to be used on all vehicles.|$|E

30|$|Hansen (1972) categorizes {{consumption}} situations into deliberation situations, exposure situations, {{and response}} situations. Response situations {{are easier to}} observe {{compared to the other}} two categories of situations. Response situations can be segmented into three subcategories, including communication situations, purchase situations, and usage situations. Engel et al. (1993) further define these subcategories and clarify their respective effects on consumers’ buying decisions. Communication <b>situations</b> are <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> consumers communicate with people or media. Communication with people refers to exchanging information with other people, such as salespersons, friends, and relatives. Communication with media refers to being exposed to media that stimulates buying, such as advertisements, media reports, and posters. Purchase <b>situations</b> are <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> consumers are buying a product or service. Each situation consists of three elements, including the information environment, retail environment, and influence of time. Information environment refers to all the information about the product desired by the consumer. Retail environment is the store environment of the retailer. Hence, it is also called “store atmosphere”. Influence of time refers to the influence caused by time and stress. Usage <b>situations</b> are <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> purchased product is used. Products are usually used only when necessary. Hence, the environment where a product is purchased and the environment where it is used may differ.|$|R
