5|$|A musical {{instrument}} is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound {{can be considered}} a {{musical instrument}}—it is through purpose <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> becomes a musical instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications.|$|E
5|$|The {{throwing}} events involve hurling {{an implement}} (such as a heavy weight, javelin or discus) from a set point, with athletes being judged on the distance <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> is thrown. Combined events involve {{the same group}} of athletes contesting a number of different track and field events. Points are given for their performance in each event and the athlete with the greatest points total at the end of all events is the winner.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its small}} size and {{location}} {{away from the}} plane of the Milky Way, Caelum is rather devoid of deep-sky objects, and contains no Messier objects. The only deep-sky object in Caelum to receive much attention is HE0450-2958, an unusual Seyfert galaxy. Originally, the jet's host galaxy proved elusive to find, and this jet appeared to be emanating from nothing. Although it has been suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> is an ejected supermassive black hole, the host is now agreed to be a small galaxy that is difficult to see due to light from the jet and a nearby starburst galaxy.|$|E

5|$|Hale {{had spent}} many {{hundreds}} of hours searching for comets without success, and was tracking known comets from his driveway in New Mexico when he chanced upon Hale–Bopp just after midnight. The comet had an apparent magnitude of 10.5 and lay near the globular cluster M70 in the constellation of Sagittarius. Hale first established {{that there was no}} other deep-sky object near M70, and then consulted a directory of known comets, finding that none were known to be in this area of the sky. Once he had established <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> was moving relative to the background stars, he emailed the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, the clearing house for astronomical discoveries.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Professor Bernard Quatermass (Andrew Keir) is dismayed {{to learn}} that {{his plans for the}} {{colonisation}} of the Moon are to be taken over by the military. He gives a cold reception to Colonel Breen (Julian Glover), who has been assigned to join Quatermass's British Experimental Rocket Group. When the bomb disposal team call for Breen's assistance, Quatermass accompanies him to the site. Breen concludes it is a V-weapon, but Quatermass disagrees. When another skeleton is found in an inner chamber, Quatermass and Roney realise <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> must also be five million years old. Quatermass suspects it is of alien origin, but Roney is certain the apemen are terrestrial.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to past entries in the series. The player, as Alex, explores the various environments and locales, searching for clues to advance the plot, such as photographs, drawings and other items which are placed inside Alex's journal, which the player may read at any time. To assist the player, Alex will turn his head towards items and clues to inform the player <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> may be picked up; other recurring items include weapons and ammunition, which give off a glow as a visual cue to the player, and health drinks. Puzzle elements also {{play a part in}} the game, and Alex's journal may be used to refer to photographs and other items that can help the player decipher such puzzles as keypad entries. For {{the first time in the}} series, the player may select responses when engaging in dialogue with other characters encountered in the game, which in turn may affect how the player sees the plot unfold.|$|E
25|$|Steuart Campbell {{has said}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> Arnold {{reported}} {{could have been}} mirages of several snow-capped peaks in Cascade Range. Campbell's calculation of the objects' speed determined that they were travelling {{at roughly the same}} speed as Arnold's plane, indicating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> were in fact stationary. Mirages could have been caused by temperature inversions over several deep valleys in the line of sight.|$|R

5|$|Passive constructions {{also use}} {{auxiliary}} verbs. A passive construction rephrases an active construction {{in such a}} way <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase, and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase. They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb to be or to get, although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with get. For example, putting the sentence she sees him into the passive becomes he is seen (by her), or he gets seen (by her).|$|E
5|$|Roney {{calls in}} his friend Professor Bernard Quatermass of the British Rocket Group {{to prevent the}} {{military}} from disturbing what he believes to be an archaeological find. Quatermass and Colonel Breen, recently appointed to lead the Rocket Group over Quatermass's objections, become intrigued by the site. As more of the artefact is uncovered additional fossils are found, which Roney dates to five million years, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> is at least that old. The interior is empty, and a symbol of five intersecting circles, which Roney identifies as the occult pentacle, is etched on a wall that appears to conceal an inner chamber.|$|E
5|$|The Asgardian Loki {{encounters}} the Other, {{the leader}} of an extraterrestrial race known as the Chitauri. In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. Nick Fury, director of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., and his lieutenant Agent Maria Hill arrive at a remote research facility during an evacuation, where physicist Dr. Erik Selvig is leading a research team experimenting on the Tesseract. Agent Phil Coulson explains <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> has begun radiating an unusual form of energy. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a wormhole, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki takes the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig {{and a couple of}} other agents, including Clint Barton, to aid him in his getaway.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two broad}} conceptions about what [...] "world" [...] is studied by metaphysics. The strong, {{classical}} view assumes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> studied by metaphysics exist independently of any observer, so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> subject {{is the most}} fundamental of all sciences. The weaker, more modern view assumes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> studied by metaphysics exist inside the mind of an observer, so the subject becomes a form of introspection and conceptual analysis. Some philosophers, notably Kant, discuss both of these [...] "worlds" [...] {{and what can be}} inferred about each one.|$|R
50|$|Detailed {{analytical}} and numerical studies of Neptune’s resonances have shown <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> {{must have a}} relatively precise range of energies. If <b>the</b> <b>object's</b> semi-major axis is outside these narrow ranges, the orbit becomes chaotic, with widely changing orbital elements.|$|R

5|$|The {{next night}} at 1945 hrs, a craft {{similar to the}} one the night before {{approached}} the base. In addition to being tracked on radar, it hovered around the area for 30 minutes, with characteristics of movement similar to a helicopter. Additionally, it hovered above the weapons storage area at the same altitude as the night before. At this time, possibly another object (it is unclear if it was the same one as the over the weapons storage area, but it is possible) was spotted over the flightline. The cigar-shaped object was described as hovering in mid-air, jerking around, and turning on and off its lights once. During the blackout, it traveled from the flightline, to the northern end of the runway. According to one service member, the object was chased, and eventually discovered to be hovering five feet off the ground. During this time, it was determined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> was four car lengths long.|$|E
5|$|The serial {{continues}} the loose chronology of the Quatermass adventures. Workmen excavating {{a site in}} Knightsbridge, London, discover a strange skull and what at first {{appears to be an}} unexploded bomb. Quatermass and his newly appointed military superior at the British Experimental Rocket Group, Colonel Breen, become involved in the investigation when it becomes apparent <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> is an alien spacecraft. The ship and its contents have a powerful and malign influence over many of those who come in contact with it, including Quatermass. It becomes obvious to him that the aliens, probably from Mars, had been abducting pre-humans and modifying them to give them psychic abilities much like their own before returning them to Earth, a genetic legacy responsible for much of the war and strife in the world.|$|E
5|$|The storyline, {{which is}} largely {{faithful}} to the original television production, centres on {{the discovery of a}} mysterious object buried at the site of an extension to the London Underground. Also uncovered nearby are the remains of early human ancestors more than five million years old. Realising <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> is in fact an ancient Martian spacecraft, Quatermass deduces that the aliens have influenced human evolution and the development of human intelligence. The spacecraft has an intelligence of its own, and once uncovered begins to exert a malign influence, resurrecting Martian memories and instincts buried deep within the human psyche.|$|E

5|$|A giant {{meteoroid}} {{approaches the}} earth, spotted from an observatory by Professor Decimus Phostle, while a self-proclaimed prophet, Philippulus, predicts {{the end of}} the world. The meteoroid misses the earth, but a fragment of it plunges into the Arctic Ocean. Phostle determines <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> is made of a new material which he names Phostlite, and sets off to find it with a crew of European scientists. Accompanied by Tintin and Snowy, their ship, the Aurora, is helmed by Tintin's friend Captain Haddock. Meanwhile, another team has set out aboard the polar expedition ship Peary, backed by the financier Mr. Bohlwinkel; wherefore, the expedition becomes a race to land on the meteorite. On the day of departure, Bohlwinkel has a henchman plant a stick of dynamite on the Aurora, but it is found and thrown overboard. In the North Sea, the Aurora is almost rammed by another of Bohlwinkel's ships, but Haddock steers out of the way. Further setbacks occur at the Icelandic port of Akureyri, when Haddock is informed that there is no fuel available. He and Tintin then come across an old friend of his, Captain Chester, who reveals that there is plenty of fuel and that the Golden Oil Company (which has a fuel monopoly) is owned by Bohlwinkel. The three then secretly run a hose from Chester's ship, Sirius, to the Aurora, and thus trick Golden Oil into providing the fuel they need.|$|E
5|$|Preservation of the Mary Rose and her {{contents}} was {{an essential}} part of the project from the start. Though many artefacts, especially those that were buried in silt, had been preserved, the long exposure to an underwater environment had rendered most of them sensitive to exposure to air after recovery. Archaeologists and conservators had to work in tandem from the start to prevent deterioration of the artefacts. After recovery, finds were placed in so-called passive storage, which would prevent any immediate deterioration before the active conservation which would allow them to be stored in an open-air environment. Passive storage depended on the type of material <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> was made of, and could vary considerably. Smaller objects from the most common material, wood, were sealed in polyethylene bags to preserve moisture. Timbers and other objects that were too large to be wrapped were stored in unsealed water tanks. Growth of fungi and microbes that could degrade wood were controlled by various techniques, including low-temperature storage, chemicals, and in the case of large objects, common pond snails that consumed wood-degrading organisms but not the wood itself.|$|E
5|$|President Lincoln {{called a}} special session of Congress to convene July 4, 1861, and Kentucky held special {{elections}} in June to select congressmen for the special session. Crittenden had expressed his desire to retire from public service and initially refused pleas to become a candidate, but he finally consented to run in late May. He was elected over secessionist candidate William E. Simms; in all, nine of Kentucky's ten congressional districts selected Unionist candidates in the special election. Upon taking his seat, {{he was assigned to}} the Committee on Foreign Affairs. On July 10, 1861, he accompanied Simon B. Buckner on a visit to President Lincoln to secure a renewed commitment from Lincoln to respect Kentucky's neutrality; Lincoln agreed only to issue a declaration that he had no present designs on Kentucky but would not commit to restrict his future actions. In order to calm the fears of border state citizens concerned about the Union's objectives in the war, he introduced the Crittenden–Johnson Resolution, which blamed the secessionist states for the war and stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> of the war was not the subjugation of those states, but the defense of the Constitution and the preservation of the Union. When those ends were achieved, the resolution stated, the war should cease. Kentucky Representative Henry C. Burnett asked that the question be divided. Burnett was one of only two votes against the portion of the resolution blaming the Southern states for the war; the only dissent on the remaining portion came from Wisconsin's John F. Potter and Ohio's Albert G. Riddle. In the Senate, the resolution passed 30–5, with Kentucky senators Breckinridge and Powell voting in the minority. In December 1861 the House refused, by a vote of 76–65, to reaffirm the resolution.|$|E
