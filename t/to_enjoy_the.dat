Extensive pleasure gardens were built within the castle and older parts redesigned to allow visitors <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>the</b> resulting views.

Burnell was also responsible for the decision to force the Court of Chancery to settle in London, rather than following the king and his court around the country. A Chancery memorandum of 1280 records that the chancellor, {{along with the other}} ministers, now had the duty of sorting the many petitions that came into the government and only passing on the most urgent to the king.|$|E
