5|$|Though Rosolie stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>special</b> was {{intended}} {{to draw attention to}} wildlife conservation and the destruction of the Amazon, the special was condemned prior to its premiere by critics and the animal rights group PETA as an inhumane publicity stunt oriented towards shock value, resulting in calls for Discovery Channel to pull the special.|$|E
5|$|During the {{airing of}} The Making of Frozen: Return to Arendelle on ABC, it was {{announced}} that a holiday special titled Olaf's Frozen Adventure is currently under production and slated for release in winter 2017.

5|$|On May 16, 2017, ABC {{announced}} that it planned to air a special broadcast of the film, The Wonderful World of Disney: The Little Mermaid Live, on October 3, 2017. The special was to feature a presentation of the film intertwined with live performances of its songs by guest musicians, {{in a similar fashion}} to the Hollywood Bowl concerts. However, on August 3, 2017, it was announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>special</b> was postponed due to budget constraints.|$|E
5|$|The {{special purpose}} {{entities}} {{were used for}} more than just circumventing accounting conventions. As a result of one violation, Enron's balance sheet understated its liabilities and overstated its equity, and its earnings were overstated. Enron disclosed to its shareholders that it had hedged downside risk in its own illiquid investments using special purpose entities. However, investors were oblivious to the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>special</b> purpose entities were actually using the company's own stock and financial guarantees to finance these hedges. This prevented Enron from being protected from the downside risk. Notable examples of special purpose entities that Enron employed were JEDI, Chewco, Whitewing, and LJM.|$|E
5|$|As August ended, {{production}} {{continued to}} slip farther behind schedule. Koenig learned {{that rather than}} being released in 14 days after his scenes were completed, his last day would be on October 26—eight weeks later than expected. The next bridge scenes to be filmed after the wormhole sequence, Enterprises approach to V'Ger and the machine's resulting attack, were postponed for two weeks so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>special</b> effects for the scene could be planned and implemented, and the engine room scenes could be shot. Chekov's burns sustained in V'Ger's attack were difficult to film; though the incident took only minutes on film, Weldon spent hours preparing the effect. A piece of aluminum foil was placed around Koenig's arm, covered by a protective pad and then hidden by the uniform sleeve. Weldon prepared an ammonia and acetic acid solution that was touched to Koenig's sleeve, causing it to smoke. Difficulties resulted in the scene being shot ten times; it was especially uncomfortable for the actor, whose arm was slightly burned {{when some of the}} solution leaked through to his arm.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Jeunet {{included}} an alternate {{version of the}} film on the Alien Quadrilogy DVD box set with different opening and closing credits, which were originally cut due to budget restrictions. The deleted scenes included references to the character Newt from Aliens, Vriess making a joke to Call, Ripley's clone {{waking up in the}} middle of her operation, an extended conversation in the mess hall that reveals the details of Ripley's former employers, Weyland-Yutani, an extended dialogue between Call and Ripley's clone in the chapel and scenes of the Betty landing on Earth and the planet's landscape during the final dialogue between Ripley and Call, as they view the ruins of Paris. The special edition restores 13 minutes and 5 seconds worth of footage (including the new opening and ending), and is 7 minutes longer than theatrical version. Jeunet has stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>special</b> edition is not a director's cut as his preferred version is the theatrical cut.|$|E

25|$|During the Buddhist crisis, he and Neil Sheehan debunked {{the claim}} by the Diệm regime that the Army of the Republic of Vietnam regular forces had perpetrated the brutal raids on Buddhist temples, which the American {{authorities}} had initially believed, but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Special</b> Forces, loyal to Diệm's brother and strategist Nhu, {{had done so}} to frame the army generals. He was also involved in a scuffle with Nhu's secret police after they punched fellow journalist Peter Arnett while the pressmen were covering a Buddhist protest.|$|E
25|$|In response, {{the seven}} {{directors}} claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>special</b> general meeting was invalid by claiming the Forum meeting {{used to call}} the special general meeting itself was invalid, and issued guidelines to the staff of the society. They asked the Supreme Court of British Columbia to declare the impeachments invalid. The bank account of the SFSS was frozen due to the controversy over who were the legitimate directors of the SFSS. This issue was resolved on November 23, 2006 with a court order enforcing an agreement between the impeached directors and the remaining directors.|$|E

25|$|A {{few days}} after Comey's dismissal, the FBI {{reportedly}} widened its investigation to examine whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice. Many FBI insiders believed the real reason Comey was fired was because he had refused to end the investigation into Russian connections to the election. In his June testimony Comey said that Trump never asked him to stop the Russia investigation. The special counsel's office took over the investigation. ABC News later clarified <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>special</b> counsel is gathering preliminary information about possible obstruction of justice, but a full-scale investigation {{has not yet been}} launched.|$|E

The parliament elected Najib Mikati, the candidate for the Hezbollah-led March 8 Alliance, Prime Minister of Lebanon, making him responsible for forming a new government. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah insists that Israel {{was responsible for the}} assassination of Hariri. A report leaked by the Al-Akhbar newspaper in November 2010 stated that Hezbollah has drafted plans for a takeover of the country in the event <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Special</b> Tribunal for Lebanon issues an indictment against its members.|$|E

Perkins subsequently in an email to the Reverend Kris Chenier, the pastor of the Trinity Heights Baptist Church in Shreveport and the chairman of the special LC panel, questioned why the committee had implied that the decision to clear Aguillard had been unanimous, rather than by the margin of a single vote.|$|E

25|$|Gentzen {{asserted}} a sharp {{distinction between}} his single-output natural deduction systems (NK and NJ) and his multiple-output sequent calculus systems (LK and LJ). He {{wrote that the}} intuitionistic natural deduction system NJ was somewhat ugly. He said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>special</b> role of the excluded middle in the classical natural deduction system NK is removed in the classical sequent calculus system LK. He said that the sequent calculus LJ gave more symmetry than natural deduction NJ {{in the case of}} intuitionistic logic, as also in the case of classical logic (LK versus NK). Then he said that in addition to these reasons, the sequent calculus with multiple succedent formulas is intended particularly for his principal theorem ("Hauptsatz").|$|E
