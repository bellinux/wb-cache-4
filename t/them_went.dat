5|$|Vaughan Williams {{was born}} at Down Ampney, Gloucestershire, the third child and younger son of the vicar, the Reverend Arthur Vaughan Williams (1834–1875) and his wife, Margaret, née Wedgwood (1842–1937). His {{paternal}} forebears were of mixed English and Welsh descent; many of <b>them</b> <b>went</b> into the law or the Church. The judges Sir Edward and Sir Roland Vaughan Williams were respectively Arthur's father and brother. Margaret Vaughan Williams was a great-granddaughter of Josiah Wedgwood and niece of Charles Darwin.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 13 May 1915, Blamey, in his {{capacity}} as 1st Division intelligence officer, led a patrol consisting of himself, Sergeant J. H. Will and Bombardier A. A. Orchard, behind the Turkish lines in an effort to locate the Olive Grove guns that had been harassing the beach. Near Pine Ridge, an enemy party of eight Turks approached; when one of <b>them</b> <b>went</b> to bayonet Orchard, Blamey shot the Turk with his revolver. In the action that followed, six Turks were killed. He withdrew his patrol back to the Australian lines without locating the guns. For this action, he was mentioned in despatches.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{negotiated}} a truce, {{under the terms}} of which the Malagasy undertook to spare the lives of the surviving crew members. In exchange it was agreed that Meermin would return to Madagascar, where the Malagasy would be released. But gambling on the Malagasy's ignorance of navigation, the wounded Muller instead ordered his crew to head for the coast of southern Africa. After making landfall at Struisbaai, in the Cape Colony, which the Malagasy were assured was their homeland, 50–70 of <b>them</b> <b>went</b> ashore. Their intention was to signal to the others still on board Meermin if it was safe for them to follow, but the shore party soon found themselves confronted by a militia of farmers formed in response to Meermins arrival; the farmers had understood that as the ship was flying no flags, it was in distress.|$|E

5|$|Soon after {{fighting}} {{broke out}} between ZANLA and ZIPRA {{members of a}} recently integrated Zimbabwe National Army battalion at Ntabazinduna, just north-east of Bulawayo, the two guerrilla camps at Entumbane began exchanging rifle, machine gun and mortar fire at about 20:00 on 11 February. Dyck, at the Alamo, reported that both sides were also attacking his position. He radioed Brigade HQ for instructions and was told to pull out; he replied that this was impossible as he was surrounded. At Shute's orders, McKenna mobilised {{the rest of the}} battalion at an airfield near Brady Barracks within an hour. Meanwhile, a detachment of ZIPRA armoured vehicles left Essexvale for Bulawayo, and was spotted on the road by one of McKenna's observation posts. Devine was sent with his Elands to intercept them, supported by 12 1RAR men under Major Tony Husher. At an intersection {{on the outskirts of the}} city, Devine encountered a ZIPRA BTR-152 APC and impacted it with a single high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) round, killing all 20 combatants inside. McKenna then told Devine to advance to the city limits, where he and Husher set up an ambush on the road. Husher's men shot out all nearby overhead street lights, and some of <b>them</b> <b>went</b> to scout ahead; Devine positioned two of his Elands on each of the two lanes of the road under cover of darkness.|$|E
5|$|Trésor {{represented}} France {{only once}} afterward and his 65-cap output was subsequently passed by defender Maxime Bossis and midfielder Michel Platini. Bossis surpassed Trésor during qualifying for the 1986 FIFA World Cup, while Platini {{went beyond the}} former Marseille and Bordeaux player at the tournament itself, in which France finished in third place. Both players retired within months of each other as Bossis finished his career occupying the record, which was now at 76 caps, four more than Platini. After appearing at the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Bossis acquired the record of appearing in the most FIFA World Cup matches for France. He was surpassed by goalkeeper Fabien Barthez in 2006. Bossis was passed just six years later by former international teammate Manuel Amoros, who finished his international career with 82 appearances. The 1992–93 UEFA Champions League winner was eventually equaled or outperformed by 12 different players. Of the 12 players, 11 of them played on the team that won the 1998 FIFA World Cup and six of <b>them</b> <b>went</b> on to become members of the FIFA Century Club, which consists of association football players who have accumulated 100 or more caps. Following the conclusion of UEFA Euro 2004, the record for France national team appearances was held by Marcel Desailly. As a result, Desailly became the first player not born in France or the overseas departments and territories to occupy the record. The current record holder for appearances with the national team is Lilian Thuram, who made 142 total competitive appearances for the team between 1994 and 2008. Thuram broke Desailly's record at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in the team's final group stage match against Togo. He is the second player born in an overseas department to hold the record, the first being Trésor. Both players were born in Guadeloupe.|$|E

25|$|In 691, {{war with}} the Arabs resumed and Justinian began {{increasing}} taxes in order to finance the conflict. However, {{in the face of}} these extortionate requisitions some 20,000 Slavic soldiers deserted to the Arabs— with <b>them</b> <b>went</b> Armenia to the enemy. Enraged, Justinian ordered the extermination of all Slavs in Bithynia— countless men, women and children were put to the sword in rage.|$|E
25|$|Australia then flew to Trinidad and Tobago, beating {{that side}} {{in first class}} match by six wickets.

25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of migration from Ireland is recorded since early Medieval times, {{but it is}} only possible to quantify it from around 1700: since then between 9 and 10 million people born in Ireland have emigrated. This is more than the population of Ireland at its historical peak in the 1840s of 8.5 million. The poorest of <b>them</b> <b>went</b> to Great Britain, especially Liverpool; those who could afford it went further, including almost 5 million to the United States.|$|E
25|$|Many Irish {{who fled}} their {{homeland}} {{because of the}} Potato Famine of the 1840s (over one million people {{died as a result}} of this famine) immigrated to the United States. A significant number of <b>them</b> <b>went</b> to Puerto Rico after being turned away at American ports because of epidemic outbreaks onboard the ships on which they sailed. Many of these Irish settlers were instrumental in the development of the island's hugely successful sugar industry. Said industry was vital to the growing local economy.|$|E
