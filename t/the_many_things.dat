5|$|Early in 197BC, Flamininus summoned Attalus to {{join him}} at Elateia (now in Roman hands) and from there they {{traveled}} together to attend a Boeotian council in Thebes to discuss which side Boeotia would take in the war. At the council Attalus spoke first, reminding the Boeotians of <b>the</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> he and his ancestors had done for them, but during his address he stopped talking and collapsed, with {{one side of his}} body paralyzed. Attalus was taken back to Pergamon, where he died {{around the time of the}} Battle of Cynoscephalae, which brought about the end of the Second Macedonian War.|$|E

25|$|Alexei's {{haemophilia}} was {{integral to}} the rise of Grigori Rasputin. One of <b>the</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> Rasputin did that unintentionally facilitated the fall of the Romanovs was to tell the Tsar that the war would be won once he (Tsar Nicholas II) took command of the Russian Army. Following this advice was a serious mistake as the Tsar had no military experience. The Tsarina, Empress Alexandra, a deeply religious woman, came to rely upon Rasputin and believe in his ability to help Alexei where conventional doctors had failed. This theme is explored in Robert K. Massie's Nicholas and Alexandra. It is possible that if Alexei had not suffered so terribly, Rasputin could never have gained such influence over Russian politics during World War I, which is generally seen to have at least hastened the collapse of Romanov rule.|$|E

She writes, [...] "I just wish this special had the balls to call itself 'I Am…Mine' and admit that among <b>the</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> we admire about Beyonce is that she's not ours.

He decided to officially become a Catholic when he saw Pope Benedict XVI, during the Pope's visit to the United States in 2008: [...] "Catching a glimpse of Pope Benedict that day, I was struck by the happiness and peacefulness he exuded. The joyful and radiating presence of the Holy Father was a moment of confirmation about <b>the</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> I had been thinking and experiencing for several years."

500|$|The two French sailors {{that reached}} Leander {{immediately}} began a systematic pillaging of the British officers' personal effects. Rather than tossing the men into the sea, as historian William James suggests {{they should have}} done, Thompson instead ordered one of the British boats to be repaired and launched to transport him to the French ship and bring back Captain Lejoille {{in the belief that}} he would end the looting. However, when the French captain arrived he immediately joined his officers, commandeering all but two of Captain Thompson's shirts and the wounded officer's cot. When Captain Berry complained that a pair of ornamental pistols had been stolen from him, Lejoille summoned the thief to the quarterdeck and took them for himself. The sailors who accompanied Lejoille were equally voracious: among <b>the</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> taken were the ship surgeon Mr Mulberry's operating tools, stolen {{in the middle of an}} operation. Without the correct equipment, the surgeon could not assist the many wounded, including Captain Thompson, who had a musket ball still embedded deeply in his arm. When Captain Berry complained, Lejoille replied [...] "J'en suis fâché, mais le fait est, que les Français sont bons au pillage" [...] ("I'm sorry, but the fact is, that the French are good at plunder").|$|E

2500|$|Reviewing {{the first}} six episodes of the season, Daniel Fienberg for The Hollywood Reporter had {{negative}} thoughts, calling Iron Fist Marvel and Netflix's [...] "first big misstep" [...] adding, [...] "Iron Fist feels like a step backward on every level, a major disappointment that already suffers from storytelling issues through {{the first six}} episodes... and would probably be mercifully skippable in its entirety if it weren't the bridge into the long awaited Defenders crossover series." [...] Fienberg noted <b>the</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> lacking in the season from previous Marvel Netflix series, including: [...] "street-level authenticity"; [...] "subtext" [...] as [...] "There's no specificity to Danny's experience other than the most generic of identity crises...and Jones is far too placid a leading man to give any sense of Danny's internal torment," [...] which leads him to come across like [...] "a spoiled frat boy"; and [...] "a worthy adversary to our hero", which added to the [...] "baffling" [...] number of basic character archetypes missing in the season, as there was also [...] "no comic relief or voice of wise authority and well-delivered exposition." [...] He called the season's fights [...] "weakly staged and all-too-brief, without any effort to even pretend that the show's leading man is doing any of his own stunts" [...] and felt [...] "Danny's strength and his enhanced abilities are barely explained and inconsistently depicted." [...] Fienberg also felt of Dawson's appearance, that [...] "after five seasons of four Marvel-Netflix shows, nobody has yet figured out what [...] role in this universe is other than 'continuity'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Musically, A Girl like Me reveals {{new types}} of musical genres {{compared}} to Rihanna's light and uptempo debut effort, Music of the Sun. Her goal on the album was to find songs that express <b>the</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> young women want to say, but might not know how. In an interview, Rihanna said: [...] "Now I'm singing about experiences that I've gone through and stuff that other 18-year-old girls go through, so it's all about progression." [...] Reggae music, present in her debut album, subsequently continues into A Girl like Me. For the album, Rihanna used influences of different music genres, including rock music, while keeping the roots of her previous album, which where reggae and dancehall. The new effort also presents Rihanna's new side with some balladic elements. Although the album mostly follows the disco-ish mode of its predecessor, it was noted for its introduction of the rock genre to Rihanna's music, mostly represented by the rock and reggae mash-up [...] "Kisses Don't Lie", though Rihanna herself stated that the album is not overall driven by rock influence. In an interview, Rihanna commented: [...] "Growing up in Barbados, I wasn't exposed {{to a lot of}} rock music. We really love reggae and soca music and hip-hop. But when I moved to the United States last year, I was exposed to a lot of different types of music, rock being one of them, and I fell in love with it. [...] I love rock music." [...] Celia SanMiguel of Vibe [...] magazine wrote that A Girl like Me is [...] "a pop album, one informed but not bounded by Rihanna's Caribbean roots", and that it [...] "dispels any lingering notions of her as a dancehall-meets-R ambassador." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine called the album [...] "a record that almost identically" [...] veered between [...] "sunny dancehall/dub-pop", [...] "hip-hop-infused club bangers", and [...] "adult-oriented ballads".|$|E
