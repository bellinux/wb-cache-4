Representatives denied these allegations by showing a video that showed an untampered signal during the Armenian performance.

Early in the game Lindsay was expected to pull off another career high. Only seven minutes after Lindsay was in the game she was caught elbowing {{a player in the}} face. The referee had then decided called a foul on Lindsay. She was sent off the court after playing for only seven minutes and 51 seconds. Because she was only on the court for such {{a short period of time}} she was only able to make just 2 points and 2 rebounds and no blocks.

The cabinet also includes a number of sub-cabinet positions. In total, within the executive branch are between 30–40 appointed and paid cabinet members that oversee everything from university policies to tracking the state's Legislature. These positions are subject to confirmation by a majority vote of the Senate. The president also has the authority <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>and</b> preside over meetings of the SGA, {{to call for a}} referendum of the student body (with two-thirds concurrence vote of the Senate), and to veto legislation passed by the Senate. The Senate may override a presidential veto with a two-thirds vote.

25|$|Jack Aubrey and Sophia Williams {{are married}} {{and the parents}} of twin girls. They live at Ashgrove Cottage on his half-pay, not enough to support fellow navy men in the household. Sophia's mother lost her money, {{including}} Sophia's portion, and now lives with them. They have Cecelia, Sophia's young niece in their household as well. As much as he loves Sophia, Aubrey {{is ready to go}} to sea again. Stephen Maturin comes <b>to</b> <b>call,</b> <b>and</b> soon after Aubrey's orders are delivered from the port Admiral. He is given command of the 38-gun frigate HMS Boadicea. At Plymouth, he picks up orders and Mr R T Farquhar, a political gentleman. He is to sail to the station at Cape Town where the ships of a convoy will meet. Not long away from home, they meet with the French ship Hébé which is escorting a captured merchant ship. The Boadicea captures both ships. He sends the prizes to Gibraltar. The timely capture allows the ship to send letters home, gain a French cook and the Hébé's English prisoners, able seamen. The long journey in the Atlantic gives Aubrey time to bring the crew of the Boadicea up to his standards of efficiency in gunnery, and gives Maturin and Farquhar time to develop strategies.|$|E

Her father was Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and her mother was Princess Louise of Hesse-Kassel. Although she was of royal blood, her family lived a comparatively normal life. They did not possess great wealth; her father's income from an army commission was about £800 per year and their house was a rent-free grace and favour property.

They waited three days for the Beastie Boys <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>and</b> say they were willing to record but eventually gave up and returned to the studios in Los Angeles. The audio tracks were recorded later. Adam [...] "MCA" [...] Yauch was unavailable {{at the time of the}} recording so only Adam [...] "King Adrock" [...] Horovitz and Michael [...] "Mike D" [...] Diamond voice themselves in the episode, with Horovitz also voicing Yauch. The Beastie Boys perform three songs in the episode: their 1998 hit single [...] "Intergalactic", [...] "Super Disco Breakin", and a brief a capella version of [...] "Sabotage". It was initially requested that they perform [...] "Fight for Your Right" [...] but they declined. The episode also contains Futuramas first original musical number. The lyrics to [...] "Welcome to Robot Hell" [...] were written by Kaplan and Keeler and the music was written by Keeler and Christopher Tyng. When praised for his performance in the audio commentary, John DiMaggio, the voice of Bender, noted that the most difficult part of the performance was singing in a lower octave rather than keeping up with the song's fast pace.|$|E
500|$|Australian activist Julian Assange—the {{founder of}} WikiLeaks—appeared as himself. Many of his lines {{were written by}} Australian author Kathy Lette, {{who is one of}} Assange's friends. According to Lette, [...] "Julian and The Simpsons {{producers}} asked me to rewrite his scene and dialogue. I guess they just wanted me to add a little Aussie irony to the script. Julian does not suffer from an irony deficiency! I used to write a sitcom for Columbia Pictures, the long-running series The Facts of Life, so the producers knew I could fire off a quip or two." [...] In 2010, Swedish authorities issued a European Arrest Warrant to extradite Assange from Britain to Sweden for questioning in relation to sexual assault allegations made against him there. Assange was arrested in England, before being freed on conditional bail until a decision would be made {{as to whether or not}} he should be extradited to Sweden. Assange recorded his lines over the phone while under house arrest in England. Jean, who directed Assange's performance from Los Angeles, only acquired a phone number <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>and</b> received no information about the whereabouts of the activist. According to Jean in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening had found out through a rumor that Assange wanted to appear on the show. Casting director Bonnie Pietila was therefore given the task to contact Assange and make sure the guest appearance could happen. The episode features no reference to Assange's legal situation at the time of his recording. Jean commented that he is [...] "a controversial figure, and there's a good reason he's controversial. There was discussion internally whether or not to have him on the show, but ultimately we went ahead and did it." [...] Groening has said in an interview that [...] "We [...] dare ourselves to do things and Julian Assange was a dare." ...|$|E

I doubt that there's a Netflix play for it." [...] She also added that ABC wanted some sort of conclusion to the series, and so the writers and producers {{would find a way}} to conclude the lingering plot threads in some form if the series was not renewed. On May 12, 2016, ABC canceled the series. Loeb said he did not understand the decision, as [...] "there were no conversations" [...] regarding the series, with Marvel only receiving a call from ABC saying Agent Carter was canceled. He added that since the networks decide what content they would like from Marvel Television, [...] "if someone wants <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>and</b> say, 'We want a two-hour Agent Carter [...] for May 2017,' [...] We'll put together the greatest Agent Carter movie we can.” Atwell added that she was also not part of the conversation to cancel the series and called it [...] "a network political thing" [...] since ABC wanted Atwell to headline the more [...] "mainstream" [...] drama Conviction [...] "to get their ratings up" [...] instead of staying on Agent Carter, which Atwell felt had gained a [...] "cult following". After speculation regarding a revival for the series by Netflix, chief content officer Ted Sarandos stated the streaming service passed on reviving Agent Carter because it is [...] "looking for truly original brands to own and in that Marvel space we already have" [...] original Marvel series. He also added that due to existing international broadcasting [...] "deal complexities" [...] for the series, Netflix would not have been able to air Agent Carter globally, as [...] "Some of those output partners still had it on the air, so they would argue its covered by their output [...] Unfortunately, it was a business decision more than a creative one." ...|$|E
