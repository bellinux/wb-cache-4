2500|$|Born in England, Hutchings {{immigrated to}} the U.S. in 1848, then went to California in 1849 during the Gold Rush. He became wealthy as a miner, lost it all in a bank failure, then became wealthy again from publishing. [...] On July 5, 1855 James Hutchings set out on what {{would be one of}} the most {{historic}} trips to the region, leading the second <b>tourist</b> <b>party</b> into Yosemite. (The first <b>tourist</b> <b>party,</b> in 1854, was led by Robert C. Lamon, but no account of the trip is known to be written.) He then became one of the first settlers in Yosemite Valley. Hutchings published an illustrated magazine, Hutchings' Illustrated California Magazine that told the world about Yosemite and the Sierra. It was said [...] "...upon the return of Hutchings' party, the descriptions staggered the skeptics and silenced the croakers. From this time forward can be considered the commencement of the visits of tourists." [...] He was a tireless promoter, of himself and Yosemite. After Yosemite Valley was dedicated as State Park in 1864, Hutchings, through his interpretation of existing preemption laws, believed he was entitled to 160 acres (647,000 m²) of land in the Valley. He sued, unsuccessfully, to have those acres deeded to himself. He did, however, get a generous payment from the state to help compensate for loss of land use. In 1875, he was banished from Yosemite Valley because of his constant challenging of the law prohibiting the construction of buildings on public lands.|$|E

Walters had insisted on two guides; prospectors, used to the rocks, who now and then took a <b>tourist</b> <b>party</b> out. The glacier brought us up some height, but after a time the surface began to be broken by big crevasses. We spent two hours picking our way across and at noon saw we must find another route. The slope on the right would take us off our line; on the left there were high, icy rocks that would puzzle {{a member of the}} Alpine club." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} in household income attributed to expenditures by Utah motor vehicle tourists from June 15 to September 5, 1969, was estimated using income multipliers from input-output analysis. Tourist expenditures were gathered through {{the distribution of}} postage-paid diaries to non-residents entering Utah. Expenditures were also segregated for Cache County, Utah. The income multipliers from state and county input-output models were used to estimate the impact of applying the state model to county data. Approximately 927, 250 <b>tourist</b> <b>parties</b> to Utah spent an estimated $ 37, 842, 81 increasing household income $ 65, 018, 557. Likewise, approximately 67, 709 <b>tourist</b> <b>parties</b> spent an estimated $ 798, 966 in Cache County. The income multipliers from the county model indicated a $ 1, 063, 728 {{increase in}} household income in Cache County, while the state model estimated this increase to be 44 percent greater...|$|R

He made extra money singing and playing his guitar at dances, performing for <b>tourist</b> <b>parties,</b> and traveling throughout the Canadian Rockies. It was during this time that he developed his own yodelling style, sometimes called an [...] "echo yodel" [...] or a [...] "three-in-one".|$|R
40|$|As {{the most}} participated British sport, fishing {{has a huge}} {{popularity}} that continues to increase. In recent {{years there has been}} a significant growth in sea fishing with local clubs, <b>tourist</b> <b>parties</b> and private groups. A similar trend has also occurred throughout Ireland, particularly with the recent developments in Anglo-Irish politics. This has made way for the potential for more vessels in the tourist growth regions. A prime example is the Dingle Bay area of west Ireland that has a huge American and German clientele. This dissertation is the preliminary design for a vessel to fulfil this valuable market...|$|R

At Cambridge I discovered that I was by temperament a scholar. The reason why at school I took no interest in learning was because learning was, of set purpose, made as uninteresting as possible. Like a Cook's <b>tourist</b> <b>party</b> through a picture gallery, we were rushed through education; the object being not that we should see and understand, but that {{we should be able to}} say that we had done it. At college I chose my own subjects, studied them in my own way. I fed on knowledge, was not stuffed with it like a Strassburg goose." ...|$|E

50|$|Commercial {{airliner}} flights on the Polar routes may pass within {{viewing distance}} of the North Pole. For example, the flight from Chicago to Beijing may come close as latitude 89° N, though because of prevailing winds return journeys go over the Bering Strait. In recent years journeys to the North Pole by air (landing by helicopter or on a runway prepared on the ice) or by icebreaker have become relatively routine, and are even available to small groups of tourists through adventure holiday companies. Parachute jumps have frequently been made onto the North Pole in recent years. The temporary seasonal Russian camp of Barneo has been established by air {{a short distance from}} the Pole annually since 2002, and caters for scientific researchers as well as <b>tourist</b> <b>parties.</b> Trips from the camp to the Pole itself may be arranged overland or by helicopter.|$|R

50|$|It is {{believed}} that a <b>tourist</b> <b>party</b> visited the caves in 1834 but the Caves were not 'officially' discovered until 1842 by Surveyor W. R. Davidson. Surveyor Wells discovered the Koh-i-noor, Bushranger, Long Tunnel, and Cathedral caves and the Hall of Terpsichore (The Dance Hall) in 1843. Explorer William Wentworth and Governor Charles Fitzroy visited Abercrombie Caves in 1844.|$|E

60|$|I {{have had}} {{dealings}} {{with some very}} bad couriers; but I have also had dealings with one who might fairly be called perfection. He was a young Polander, named Joseph N. Verey. He spoke eight languages, {{and seemed to be}} equally at home in all of them; he was shrewd, prompt, posted, and punctual; he was fertile in resources, and singularly gifted in the matter of overcoming difficulties; he not only knew how to do everything in his line, but he knew the best ways and the quickest; he was handy with children and invalids; all his employer needed to do was to take life easy and leave everything to the courier. His address is, care of Messrs. Gay & Son, Strand, London; he was formerly a conductor of Gay's <b>tourist</b> <b>parties.</b> Excellent couriers are somewhat rare; if the reader is about to travel, he will find it to his advantage to make a note of this one.|$|R

50|$|A modern <b>tourist</b> <b>party</b> bike usually {{features}} open {{seating for}} eight or more riders in a sociable configuration. These vehicles are often {{designed to look}} like early 20th century trolley cars and have side seating for the pedalers, a bench seat in the rear, rack-and-pinion steering, and a canopy top. A few manufacturers offer an electric assist motor to aid the riders on hilly terrain. Modern party bikes are typically fifteen to twenty feet long, seven feet wide and eight feet tall. Because they are driven on municipal streets, some have headlights, tail lights, and turn signals, as well as lighting for use at night.|$|E

Brought together by a company then called Mountain Travel (now called Mountain Travel-Sobek), the group first met Norgay in India before beginning the trek. The official trek began in Paro, northern Bhutan and included a visit to Tiger's Nest (Paro Taktsang), the ancient Buddhist monastery, before returning to India via Nepal and Sikkim. Norgay even introduced his group to the King of Sikkim (the last king of Sikkim, as Sikkim is now a part of India) and brought them {{to his home in}} India for a farewell celebration.|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of tourists visiting Utah that are pertinent to defining target markets for {{the direction of}} state promotion programs were studied and analyzed {{during the summer of}} 1966. Five significant geographical-party composition target markets were identified as prospective tourist markets. These were California families, East-Wes t North Central families, Western families, East- West North Central couples, and California couples. Target markets of enroute tourist parties were also identified for instate promotional efforts. The markets identified were divided on their relative degree of vacation planning and willingness to deviate from a planned route to visit additional attractions. Significant differences among parties found in different regions of the State were identified. Some of the differential variables studied were education, income, occupation, and <b>tourist</b> <b>party</b> vacation area suggesters and decision makers...|$|E

40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1985. Bibliography: leaves 81 - 87. Microfilm. vii, 87 leaves, bound 29 cmThe {{purpose of}} this study is to test two hypotheses: (1) that tax deductibility and the joint benefit nature of goods on the business-pleasure {{borderline}} increases the demand for business travel and (2) that deductibility and jointness decreases price elasticity. The methodology of the study is a comparison of the expenditure behavior of business travelers with that of pleasure travelers. The Linear Expenditure System allocation model is applied to tourist expenditures on individual travel goods at a particular destination. Six different classes of goods are analyzed: (1) food, (2) lodging, (3) recreation, (4) local transportation, (5) clothing and (6) other. Budget data for <b>tourist</b> <b>parties</b> are from the Hawaii Visitors Bureau expenditure surveys for 1974, 1977, and 1980. Business travelers are shown to have higher expenditures than pleasure travelers for food, lodging, and local transportation. The LES minimum demanded quantities also appear to be higher for business travelers. The uncompensated price elasticities of business travelers are significantly smaller than that of pleasure travelers for (1) local transportation, (2) clothing and (3) other, and appear to be smaller across all categories of goods. Compensated own and cross price elasticities are insignificant for the business traveler...|$|R
50|$|Jeff Gordon {{bought the}} vessel in 2007, {{providing}} {{the funds to}} complete the project. The deck steelwork was replaced and her steering and engine controls were reinstated. In June 2007 Lady Cutler sailed to Portland, where she was slipped and her hull surveyed. On the return voyage she encountered gale force winds and large seas in the Bass Strait. Her engine broke down and she was towed to her berth. She completed her refurbishment in Melbourne in December 2007 and the following month was recommissioned by Lady Joan Cutler, Sir Roden Cutler's 2nd wife. Lady Cutler entered service as a <b>tourist</b> and <b>party</b> boat, branded as Melbourne Showboat.|$|R

40|$|A human {{dimensions}} {{investigation into}} tourist anglers in a coastal recreational fishing hotspot in northern Australia is presented. Tourist anglers target one species, javelin grunter, Pomadasys kaakan (Cuvier), raising {{concerns about the}} sustainability of the fishery. Data from a survey of 427 <b>tourist</b> angling <b>parties</b> that fished in the coastal water off Karumba (Queensland) were analysed. Exploratory factor analysis was performed on angler target species and motivation for fishing to establish a typology of fishing intentions, with fishing for food {{found to be the}} principal factor. Anglers with high fishing for food factor scores were more consumptive, lower spending (per day) and more averse to any potential measures that might reduce legal possession (creel) limits or impose a cost of fishing. It was concluded that a combination of tourism and fisheries management interventions is required to safeguard Karumba’s iconic javelin grunter fishery into the future. Diversification of tourist activity options can reduce the tourism industry’s current reliance on high-consumptive tourist anglers and increase the destination’s appeal to non-fishing tourists and low-consumptive anglers. Modification of angler behaviour can be achieved through reduced possession limits for javelin grunter and possibly other target species, improved monitoring and law enforcement efforts, and targeted education and information.
