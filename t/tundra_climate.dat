25|$|Grytviken has a <b>tundra</b> <b>climate</b> (Köppen ETf).|$|E
50|$|<b>Tundra</b> <b>climates</b> are {{characterized}} by sub-freezing mean annual temperatures, large annual temperature ranges, and moderately low precipitation.|$|R
50|$|Above 3000 metres {{is where}} cold, subpolar climates {{dominate}} and where frost and occasional snow become more commonplace. The subpolar oceanic climate (Köppen Cfc), existing between 3000 and 3500 metres, {{can be found}} on the mountain slopes of Indonesia's highest peaks, and serves as a transition between oceanic <b>climates</b> and <b>tundra</b> <b>climates.</b> <b>Tundra</b> <b>climates</b> (Köppen ET), are found anywhere above 3500 metres on the highest peaks of Indonesia, including the permanently snow-capped peaks in Papua. In this climate regime, average monthly temperatures are all below 10 °C, and monthly precipitation is uniform.|$|R

25|$|Aasiaat has a <b>tundra</b> <b>climate</b> (ET) with a July mean of only 5.7.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate is}} classed as subpolar oceanic climate {{according}} to the Köppen climate classification: Cfc, with areas having a <b>tundra</b> <b>climate,</b> especially in the mountains, although some coastal or low-lying areas can have very mild-winter versions of a <b>tundra</b> <b>climate.</b> The overall character of the islands' climate {{is influenced by the}} strong warming influence of the Atlantic Ocean, which produces the North Atlantic Current. This, together with the remoteness of any source of warm airflows, ensures that winters are mild (mean temperature 3.0 to 4.0nbsp&°C or 37 to 39nbsp&°F) while summers are cool (mean temperature 9.5 to 10.5nbsp&°C or 49 to 51nbsp&°F).|$|E
25|$|The {{province}} {{has been}} divided into six climate types, but broadly Newfoundland has a cool summer subtype of a humid continental climate, which is {{greatly influenced by}} the sea since {{no part of the}} island is more than 100km (62mi) from the ocean. Northern Labrador is classified as a polar <b>tundra</b> <b>climate,</b> southern Labrador has a subarctic climate.|$|E
50|$|While {{the coastal}} cities of Maracaibo, Barcelona, Porlamar and Maiquetia can get {{extremely}} hot, cities located at valleys such as Mérida, Caracas, Los Teques and San Cristobal have cooler climates, {{and the highest}} towns of Mucuchies and Apartaderos have cold (<b>tundra)</b> <b>climates.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Permafrost, the {{dominant}} natural {{phenomenon of the}} tundra is of fundamental significance for this unique ecosystem, as it commands the <b>tundra's</b> <b>climate,</b> wild life, ecology, drainage and soils.

25|$|The {{southern}} and by far most populous regions of Scandinavia have a temperate climate. Scandinavia extends {{north of the}} Arctic Circle, but has relatively mild weather for its latitude due to the Gulf Stream. Much of the Scandinavian mountains have an alpine <b>tundra</b> <b>climate.</b> There are many lakes and moraines, legacies of the last glacial period, which ended about ten millennia ago.|$|E
25|$|The north-south {{extent of}} the {{province}} (46°36′N to 60°22′N), prevalent westerly winds, cold ocean currents and local factors such as mountains and coastline combine to create the various climates of the province. Northern Labrador is classified as a polar <b>tundra</b> <b>climate,</b> southern Labrador has a subarctic climate, while most of Newfoundland has a humid continental climate (Dfb under the Köppen climate classification system): cool summer subtype.|$|E
25|$|Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The {{interior}} {{consists of}} a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence keep summers chilly, {{with most of the}} archipelago having a <b>tundra</b> <b>climate.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fungi {{and other}} organisms that gain their biomass from {{oxidizing}} organic materials are called decomposers {{and are not}} primary producers. However, lichens located in <b>tundra</b> <b>climates</b> are an exceptional example of a primary producer that, by mutualistic symbiosis, combine photosynthesis by algae (or additionally nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria) with the protection of a decomposer fungus.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tundra</b> <b>climates</b> ordinarily fit the Köppen climate {{classification}} ET, signifying a {{local climate}} in which at least one month has an average temperature high enough to melt snow (0 C), but no month with an average temperature in excess of 10 C. The cold limit generally meets the EF climates of permanent ice and snows; the warm-summer limit generally corresponds with the poleward or altitudinal limit of trees, where they grade into the subarctic climates designated Dfd, Dwd and Dsd (extreme winters as in parts of Siberia), Dfc typical in Alaska, Canada, parts of Scandinavia, European Russia, and Western Siberia (cold winters with months of freezing), or even Cfc (no month colder than -3 C as in parts of Iceland and southernmost South America). <b>Tundra</b> <b>climates</b> as a rule are hostile to woody vegetation even where the winters are comparatively mild by polar standards, as in Iceland.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from these}} main types, other sub-types can be found, like the desertic climate {{in parts of}} southeastern Spain, like in coastal Almería. Humid continental, alpine and <b>tundra</b> <b>climates</b> in the Pyrenees and Sierra Nevada, and a typical {{subtropical}} climate in the Canary Islands, varying from humid subtropical climates to desertic climates {{in most of the}} islands, and a tropical hot semi-arid climate in coastal parts, such as Tenerife or Gran Canaria.|$|R
25|$|During {{the last}} ice age, the Netherlands had a <b>tundra</b> <b>climate</b> with scarce {{vegetation}} and the inhabitants survived as hunter-gatherers. After {{the end of the}} ice age, various Paleolithic groups inhabited the area. It is known that around 8000 BC a Mesolithic tribe resided near Burgumer Mar (Friesland). Another group residing elsewhere is known to have made canoes. The oldest recovered canoe in the world is the Pesse canoe. According to C14 dating analysis it was constructed somewhere between 8200 BC and 7600 BC. This canoe is exhibited in the Drents Museum in Assen.|$|E
25|$|Norway {{lies between}} latitudes 57° and 81° N, and longitudes 4° and 32° E. The land is mostly made of hard granite and gneiss rock, but slate, sandstone, and {{limestone}} are also common, {{and the lowest}} elevations contain marine deposits. Because of the Gulf Stream and prevailing westerlies, Norway experiences higher temperatures and more precipitation than expected at such northern latitudes, especially along the coast. The mainland experiences four distinct seasons, with colder winters and less precipitation inland. The northernmost part has a mostly maritime Subarctic climate, while Svalbard has an Arctic <b>tundra</b> <b>climate.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most of Yukon has a subarctic climate (Köppen climate {{classification}} Dfc), {{characterized by}} long cold winters and brief warm summers. The airstrip at Snag, 25 kilometres east of Beaver Creek near the Alaska border, experienced the lowest ever temperature measured in North America, -63.0°C (-81.4°F) on February 3, 1947. The Arctic Ocean coast has a <b>Tundra</b> <b>climate</b> (ET). The climate is generally very dry, with little precipitation, but is considerably wetter in the southeast. Precipitation {{is much greater}} in the mountains, and the snowpack continues to melt well into the summer, resulting in high water in July or August.|$|E
50|$|In the Köppen climate classification, the Swiss Plateau is classed as Maritime Temperate or Oceanic climate (Cfb) and the Alps are {{considered}} <b>Tundra</b> <b>climates</b> or (ET). A maritime temperate area will have changeable, often overcast weather. Summers are cool due to cloud cover and winters are milder than expected due to latitude. The Jura will be slightly cooler due to higher altitude. Within the Alps, temperatures and snow fall correlate to altitude.|$|R
25|$|According to the Koppen Climate Classification Austria has the {{following}} climate types: Oceanic (Cfb), Cool/Warm-summer humid continental (Dfb), Subarctic/Subalpine (Dfc), Tundra/Alpine (ET) and Ice-Cap (EF). Its {{important to note}} though that Austria in general does not get very cold in winter but rather cool in summer at higher altitudes. The subarctic and <b>tundra</b> <b>climates</b> seen around the Alps are much warmer in winter than what is normal elsewhere {{due in part to}} the Oceanic influence on this part of Europe.|$|R
50|$|Bolívar is a {{province}} in Ecuador. The capital is Guaranda. Much {{of the province}} has a cool, 'sierra' climate, but the part in the lower foothills has a cold, <b>tundra</b> like <b>climate.</b>|$|R

50|$|North America {{extends to}} within 10° of {{latitude}} {{of both the}} equator and the North Pole. It embraces every climatic zone, from tropical rain forest and savanna on the lowlands of Central America to areas of permanent ice cap in central Greenland. Subarctic and <b>tundra</b> <b>climates</b> prevail in north Canada and north Alaska, and desert and semiarid conditions are found in interior regions cut off by high mountains from rain-bearing westerly winds. However, most of the continent has temperate climates very favorable to settlement and agriculture. Prairies, or vast grasslands cover a huge amount in mountain ranges.|$|R
5000|$|The country {{falls into}} four {{horizontal}} temperature zones {{based primarily on}} elevation, having tropical, dry, temperate with dry winters, and polar (alpine <b>tundra)</b> <b>climates,</b> amongst others.

50|$|The weather on Attu is {{typically}} cloudy, rainy, and foggy. High winds occur occasionally. Five or {{six days a}} week are likely to be rainy, and there are only about eight or ten clear days a year. The rest of the time, even if rain is not falling, fog of varying density is the rule rather than the exception. There are 39 - 49 in of annual rainfall and other precipitation, with the heaviest rains in the autumn and early winter. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Attu has a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) with effects similar to <b>tundra</b> <b>climates.</b> For its latitude the climate is exceptionally chilly, with temperatures averaging mid-50's in summer.|$|R
2500|$|Macquarie Island's {{climate is}} moderated by the sea, and all months {{have an average}} {{temperature}} above freezing although snow is common between June and October and may even occur in Macquarie Island's [...] "summer".

50|$|Like {{the rest}} of the Antarctic Peninsula, the base has a polar climate {{characterized}} by strong winds that descend downwards from Antarctic ice sheet. These winds can exceed 250 km/h, leading to blowing snow and reduced visibility. The presence of two months with temperature means just barely above freezing means the climate is classified as a polar <b>tundra</b> (ET) <b>climate</b> in the Köppen system.|$|R
25|$|Arctic <b>tundra</b> (Köppen <b>climate</b> {{classification}} ET) covers {{virtually all}} of Nunavut, the only exceptions being the area roughly between the Four Corners and Ennadai and Nueltin Lakes, where a marginal taiga forest exists, and small zones of permanent ice caps, found {{on some of the}} larger Arctic Islands (especially Baffin, Devon and Ellesmere) at sites having a relatively high elevation. Nunavut's vegetation is partially composed of rare berries, lichens, Arctic Willows, moss, tough grass, and small willow shrubs.|$|R
2500|$|The coastal {{climate of}} Norway is {{exceptionally}} mild compared with areas on similar latitudes {{elsewhere in the}} world, with the Gulf Stream passing directly offshore the northern areas of the Atlantic coast, continuously warming {{the region in the}} winter. Temperature anomalies found in coastal locations are exceptional, with Røst and Værøy lacking a meteorological winter in spite of being north of the Arctic Circle. The Gulf Stream has this effect only on the northern parts of Norway, not in the south, despite what is commonly believed. The northern coast of Norway would thus be ice-covered if not for the Gulf Stream. As a side-effect, the Scandinavian Mountains prevent continental winds from reaching the coastline, causing very cool summers throughout Atlantic Norway. Oslo has more of a continental climate, similar to Sweden's. The mountain ranges have subarctic and <b>tundra</b> <b>climates.</b> There is also very high rainfall in areas exposed to the Atlantic, such as Bergen. Oslo, in comparison, is dry, being in a rain shadow. Skjåk in Oppland county is also in the rain shadow {{and is one of the}} driest places with [...] precipitation annually.
