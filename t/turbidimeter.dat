50|$|A {{more popular}} term for this {{instrument}} in water quality testing is a <b>turbidimeter.</b> However, {{there can be}} differences between models of turbidimeters, depending upon the arrangement (geometry) of the source beam and the detector. A nephelometric <b>turbidimeter</b> always monitors light reflected off the particles and not attenuation due to cloudiness. In the United States environmental monitoring the turbidity standard unit is called Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU), while the international standard unit is called Formazin Nephelometric Unit (FNU). The most generally applicable unit is Formazin Turbidity Unit (FTU), although different measurement methods can give quite different values as reported in FTU (see below).|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to present}} {{a review of the}} design and {{development}} of the <b>turbidimeter</b> for measuring the turbidity level in water. Monitoring the turbidity level of water is important because it is related to public health. Design/methodology/approach - A precise and reliable <b>turbidimeter</b> can provide vital data that reveals the water condition level. Several <b>turbidimeter</b> units are discussed briefly. Three types of <b>turbidimeter</b> design - single beam, ratio and modulated four beams - are elaborated with some illustrations of the design concept. Various improvements and innovations for upgrading <b>turbidimeter</b> design are also discussed. Findings - This paper elaborated on a new method of estimating the water turbidity level in water samples using an optical tomography system based on the independent component analysis method. The results showed that a tomography-based <b>turbidimeter</b> can measure slight changes in the level of turbidity when the volume of contaminants is changed slightly. The <b>turbidimeter</b> can also provide a profile of the distribution of the turbidity in the water sample.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{influx of}} sediments carried by rivers can be {{measured}} continuously using a <b>turbidimeter</b> through the indirect relationship between turbidity and suspended sediment concentration (SSC). However, this process is dependent on obtaining water samples with suspended sediments to calibrate the <b>turbidimeter.</b> Sampling {{can be carried out}} through different methods, resulting in errors and uncertainties in estimating the SSC. Four different possibilities for the composition of the calibration curve were tested in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the <b>turbidimeter</b> calibration for different sampling strategies. The study was conducted in 2012 and 2013 in two catchments in southern Brazil that had a strong sediment yield impact. The results indicate that sampling during rainfall events generate a significant and representative SSC for the <b>turbidimeter</b> calibration. The use of an integrating sampler for synthetic samples provides an effective calibration, but overestimates SSC compared to calibration from rainfall event sampling. The samples collected at fixed intervals - weekly and daily - generated an insufficient amount of data and are not representative of real sediment concentrations of the catchments...|$|E
40|$|The {{goals of}} the April 30 -May 2, 2002, Federal Interagency Subcommittee on Sedimentation Workshop on “Turbidity and Other Sediment Surrogates, ” were to (1) propose a {{technically}} supportable, unambiguous definition of turbidity, and (2) describe the proper use, capabilities, and limitations of <b>turbidimeters</b> and other instruments for providing reliable surrogate data to characterize selected properties of suspended sediment, and for sediment-flux computations. There is considerable ambiguity in the definition, meter calibration, and measurement of turbidity. Turbidity measurements can be unreliable and relatively inaccurate. A new standard method for measurement of the optical properties of natural water and wastewater is recommended. Standard and reliable procedures are needed for measuring and storing data on water clarity and suspended sediment, and for computing sediment fluxes...|$|R
50|$|Formazine is {{very poorly}} {{soluble in water}} and when {{directly}} synthesized in aqueous solution, by simply mixing its two highly soluble precursors, it forms small size colloidal particles. These organic colloids are responsible of the light scattering of the formazine suspensions in all the directions. Optical properties of colloidal suspensions depend on the suspended particles size and size distribution. Because formazine is a stable synthetic material with uniform particle size {{it is commonly used}} as a standard to calibrate <b>turbidimeters</b> and to control the reproducibility of their measurements. Formazin use was first proposed by Kingsbury et al. (1926) for the rapid standardization of turbidity measurements of albumin in urine. The unit is called Formazin Turbidity Unit (FTU).

40|$|The {{physical}} {{removal of}} colloidal particles, microorganisms and other particu-late material {{is an important}} objective for drinking water utilities.

The research describes a survey of particle removal at four water treatment plants in Nova Scotia. Turbidity and particle counts were analyzed in both raw and fil-tered water. The treatment processes of the four plants was compared using par-ticle count data.

In this work the use of a nephelometric probe for the investigation on crystallization kinetics is reported. An experimental investigation on the nucleation of potassium sulphate crystals from aqueous solution was carried out by applying the isothermal method. The nephelometer allowed detecting the nuclei appearance. Moreover the recorded signal during the first period of time after nucleation can be related to the increase of the crystal mass in suspension, which accounts for nucleation and crystal growth processes...|$|R
40|$|Two {{mooring lines}} {{equipped}} with near-bottom sediment traps were {{deployed in the}} axis of the Nazare submarine canyon at similar to 1600 and similar to 3300 m depth, respectively. We studied time-series of particle flux, composition (biogenic silica, carbonates, organic matter and lithogenic fractions), granulometry, mineralogy and Pb- 210 concentration of particulate matter over five sediment trap deployments between October 2002 and December 2004. Current meters equipped with <b>turbidimeters</b> were also deployed at trap depths to monitor the water flow, temperature, salinity and suspended particle concentration. The composition of the collected particles was fairly constant year-round, dominated by the lithogenic fraction and with OC/N ratios in the range 11 - 21, suggesting an important terrigenous influence inside the canyon. The results show contrasting dynamic environments in the upper (1600 m depth) and middle (3300 m depth) canyon. High current speeds (spring tides up to 80 cm s(- 1)) and high apparent mass fluxes of particulate matter (mean 65 g m(- 2) d(- 1); maximum 265 g m(- 2) d(- 1)) are permanent at the shallowest station. At the deepest site, fluxes were below 10 g m(- 2) d(- 1) {{most of the time}} and the annual flux was governed by events of sharp flux increase. Storms affecting the continental shelf during autumn and winter are a major driver of down-canyon dispersal of sediments to the middle canyon and beyond. Important nepheloid activity developed inside the canyon in response to storms with significant wave heights between 4 and 6 m, as testified by <b>turbidimeters</b> deployed in midwater and near the seabed at 1600 m water depth. On three occasions during the study period, significant wave heights of incident storms surpassed 7 m, leading to notable episodes of down-canyon transport that were clearly observed in the middle canyon. During one of these stormy periods (January 2003) a sediment gravity flow transporting unusual quantities of sand and coastal plant debris was observed at 3200 m. However, a storm with significant wave heights as low as 5 m was apparently able to trigger a sediment gravity flow reaching beyond the middle canyon. The role of storms in the offshore dispersal of sediments is clearly relevant but seems to be modulated by synergic factors such as river flooding...|$|R

40|$|Turbidimeters operate {{based on}} the optical {{phenomena}} that occur when incident light through water body is scattered by the existence of foreign particles which are suspended within it. This review paper elaborates on the standards and factors that may influence the measurement of turbidity. The discussion also focuses on the optical fiber sensor technologies that have been applied within the lab and field environment and have been implemented in the measurement of water turbidity and concentration of particles. This paper also discusses and compares results from three different <b>turbidimeter</b> designs that use various optical components. Mohd Zubir and Bashah and Daraigan have introduced a design which has simple configurations.

40|$|The main {{characteristics}} of a crystal population from a crystallizer to be controlled are, in order of importance, the amount of fine crystals and the average size of the overall crystal product. Therefore a suitable control strategy may be based, firstly, on a feedback control loop of the magma density of fines and, secondly, on a correction of the set-point of the fines magma density {{in order to obtain}} a more convenient value of the average crystal size. The on-line measurement of the magma density can be provided by quite simple instruments, like as <b>turbidimeters</b> based on laser-light diffraction, whereas the on-line measurements of the average crystal size is a difficult and expansive task. Thus the estimation of this latter variable by means of a Projection to Latent Structures (PLS) algorithm is proposed in this work, in the frame of an inferential cascade control strategy. The investigated system has been a cooling crystallizer of potassium sulphate from aqueous solutions at bench pilot scale.

It was also noted that on the terraces of the reservoir flushing was not very effective since they were covered with water hyacinths which had trapped the sediments.

40|$|Abstract: Badlands are {{important}} in terms of sediment yield, particularly in mountain areas having subhumid and humid climatic conditions. Various studies concerning erosion and hydrological processes have demonstrated that suspended sediment transport is probably the main process in sediment export from badland areas. In the Araguás catchment (central Pyrenees) there is a statistically significant positive linear relationship between maximum discharge and the maximum suspended sediment concentration (SSC). The high frequency of hyper-concentrated fluxes of SSC (> 500 g l- 1) recorded at two gauging stations close to badland areas in the Pyrenees (Araguás) and the Alps (Draix) indicates that these fluxes are not uncommon, and suggests that they may transport relatively large suspended particles, especially during extreme floods. In a study involving sampling during two moderate floods (August 2006 and February 2007) in the Araguás catchment it was observed that the mean suspended sediment particle size was significantly greater during the highest SSC conditions. The results showed the great heterogeneity of particle sizes that can affect suspended sediment transport, which is usually estimated from concentration determined from turbidity values obtained using infrared devices and associated with the corresponding discharge value.

We demonstrated that there is only a moderate concordance between the two FLC assays.

40|$|Traditional {{sampling}} methods are restrictive for {{spatial and temporal}} monitoring of suspended sediment in river. Application of these methods is simple but labour intensive to collect and process. For this reason, the use of new technological methods has recently gained importance. These methods are commonly based on the scattering of sound or light in water. Acoustic methods involve propagating sound at around the Megahertz frequency range through the water column. Short bursts of high frequency sound are transmitted from a transducer and directed towards the measurement water sample. Sediment in suspension will scatter {{a part of this}} sound back to the transducer. Another method, laser scattering, directs a laser beam through the sample of water where particles in suspension will scatter, absorb and reflect the beam. The scattered laser beam is received by a ring detector that allows measurement of the scattering angle of the beam. Particle size and volumetric concentration can be calculated from knowledge of this angle. In addition to these methods, optical <b>turbidimeters</b> supply an estimate for suspended sediment concentration through measuring either the backscatter of the light or the attenuation of a light beam passing through a water sample.
