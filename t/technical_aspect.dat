5|$|In {{the context}} of the {{commercial}} dance industry, hip-hop (or new style hip-hop for dancers in France and Japan) is choreographed urban party dancing with studio technique added to it. From a <b>technical</b> <b>aspect,</b> it is characterized as hard-hitting involving flexibility and isolations—moving a specific body part independently from others. The feet are grounded, the chest is down, the posture is hunched, and the body is kept loose so that dancers can easily alternate between hitting the beat or moving through the beat. Like African dance, new style hip-hop is very rhythmic and involves a lot of footwork and radial movement of the hips. In addition, emphasis is placed on musicality—how sensitive your movements are to the music—and being able to freestyle (improvise). As long as dancers keep the foundational movements, they can add their own (free)style and have a performance that is still hip-hop.|$|E

25|$|In {{compliance}} with the Supreme Court order of 15 April 2013, the Ministry of Environment and Forests has constituted a panel for deciding {{the best course of}} action in translocation of animals to Gir. The panel comprises 12 members including member secretary National Tiger Conservation Authority, the Chief Wildlife Wardens of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, member Wildlife Institute of India, and scientists Drs Ravi Chellam, Y.V. Jhala, NK Ranjeet Singh and PR Sinha. The panel will advice both the states on <b>technical</b> <b>aspect</b> of transloction, decide the composition of animals to be translocated, select the prides and animals, supervise the translocation, monitor it and periodically report to the Ministry. During the first deliberations on 29 July 2013, the panel acceded the need to follow the recent IUCN translocation guidelines but brushed aside Gujarat's objections against the process. A two-member team comprising Dr Ravi Chellam and Dr Y.V. Jhala has been set up to decide the translocation protocol and report within six weeks.|$|E

500|$|Having {{sold about}} 25 million units worldwide, Megadeth {{is one of}} the few bands from the 1980s American {{underground}} metal scene to have achieved mass commercial success. Along with contemporaries Metallica, Slayer, and Anthrax, Megadeth is regarded as one of the core founding groups of thrash metal. These bands are often referred to as the [...] "big four" [...] of thrash metal, responsible for the genre's development and popularization. Loudwire ranked Megadeth the third best thrash metal band of all time, praising the group's [...] "provoking lyrics and mind-warping virtuosity". CMJ New Music Report called the band's debut album a seminal release and a representative of [...] "the golden age of speed metal". Similarly, Billboard called the band's second album Peace Sells... but Who's Buying? a [...] "landmark of the thrash movement" [...] whose lyrics it found still relevant. MTV also recognized the band as an influential metal act, highlighting the <b>technical</b> <b>aspect</b> of the early albums.|$|E

In December 2016, Kotakus Patricia Hernandez wrote about his stylistic changes, explaining that [...] "over the last year, the PewDiePie channel {{has also had}} an underlying friction, as Kjellberg slowly distances himself {{from many of the}} things that made him famous. He's doing fewer Let's Plays of horror games like Amnesia," [...] and adding, [...] "the PewDiePie of 2016 can still be immature, sure, but [...] a defining aspect of recent PewDiePie videos is existential angst, as he describes the bleak reality of making content for a machine he cannot fully control or understand." [...] On the <b>technical</b> <b>aspect</b> of his videos, PewDiePie spoke about how his early videos would feature raw footage, although he later began to dedicate time to edit his videos.|$|E
500|$|This comment {{illustrates}} {{well the}} general nature of Szigeti's reception by both critics and fellow musicians: while his musical insights, intellect, {{and depth of}} interpretation were almost universally lauded, the purely <b>technical</b> <b>aspect</b> of his playing was awarded a more mixed reaction. His tone in particular {{seems to have been}} occasionally uneven from performance to performance. A 1926 recital review in The New York Times, for example, laments that ... his performance was stiff and dry in its observance of letter and its absence of spirit ... Mr. Szigeti was not only inclined to dryness of tone and angularity of phrase, but there were also passages of poor intonation. In contrast, a review from the previous year in the same journal remarked after a performance of the Beethoven concerto that Mr. Szigeti has a rather small but beautiful tone, elegance, finish. He played with a quiet sincerity which grew upon the audience, though not with the virility and sweep that other violinists find ... it is clear that Mr. Szigeti is a player to command esteem and respect for his musicianship, for the genuineness of his interpretations, and his artistic style.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{praised the}} {{performances}} of the lead pair, their chemistry, {{the music and the}} production design, particularly the re-creation of 1960s Mumbai, but were disappointed with the story's predictability. Calling the film [...] "uncomplicated and charming", Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama gave the film a rating of 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Not the usual romantic fare, this one presents three different stories in three different eras without getting theatrical or melodramatic. Thanks to its innovative storytelling, it comes across as the perfect date movie, holding tremendous appeal for the Facebook Gen. Teri Meri Kahaani is pleasurable and fascinating in equal measures." [...] He said that the chemistry between the lead actors was what made the film work, and noted the production design as [...] "impressive" [...] and the cinematography as [...] "top notch". Sonia Chopra of Sify gave it 3 out of 5 stars, concluding, [...] "Teri Meri Kahaani holds your attention whether it's the writing, storytelling, or the <b>technical</b> <b>aspect.</b> It's a popcorn cruncher, but that's also fairly intelligent and hearty." [...] She added that the two leads [...] "sparkle with earnestness and zing," [...] with Kapoor [...] "sure to increase his fan-following several fold" [...] and Chopra [...] "easily slipping in-and-out of the layered characters with dexterity." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{their book}} on the history and legacy of the Moog synthesizer, Trevor Pinch and Frank Trocco cite Harrison's use of Krause's studio {{demonstration}} {{as an example of}} the difficulties faced by [...] "Moogists" [...] such as Beaver and Krause in gaining acceptance for their efforts. The authors write that the perception in the recording industry during the late 1960s was typically that, because of the highly <b>technical</b> <b>aspect</b> of the Moog modular system, these pioneers were simply engineers rather than artists or musicians. Pinch and Trocco highlight Mort Garson's The Wozard of Iz and Mason Williams' The Mason Williams Ear Show as further examples; in the case of the latter album, Beaver was credited as being [...] "in charge of plugging and unplugging".|$|E
