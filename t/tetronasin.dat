The {{effects of}} <b>tetronasin</b> on ruminal protein metabolism were investigated in vitro using ruminal fluid from cattle receiving <b>tetronasin</b> in the diet, ovine ruminal fluid from animals not receiving <b>tetronasin</b> and pure cultures of proteolytic ruminal bacteria.

The effect of deamination disappeared after 84 d, although the proteolytic activity remained lower (P less than. 10) than that of controls. When <b>tetronasin</b> was added in vitro to ruminal fluid from sheep not receiving the ionophore, proteolytic activity (14 C-labeled casein hydrolysis) was unaffected, but the rate of ammonia production from amino acids was decreased by 87 % (P less than. 01).

Potentiation by metal ions of the {{efficacy}} of the ionophores, monensin and <b>tetronasin,</b> towards four species of ruminal bacteria. FEMS Microbiology Letters, 338 (2), 161 - 167. Concentrations of Na(+), K(+) and Ca(2 +) in the growth medium were varied within limits normally found in vivo to determine how cation concentrations affect the sensitivity of ruminal bacteria to the ionophores, monensin (a Na(+) /H(+) and K(+) /H(+) exchanger) and <b>tetronasin</b> (Ca(2 +) /H(+)). High [Na(+) ] (172 ?mM cf. 137 ?mM in control medium) enhanced {{the efficacy}} of monensin towards Eubacterium ruminantium 2388, Streptococcus bovis C 277, Lactobacillus casei LB 17 and Prevotella albensis M 384. High [K(+) ] (35 ?mM cf. 19 ?mM) alone caused a decreased potency of both ionophores, except with L. ?casei. Added Ca(2 +) (7. 4 cf. 2. 8 ?mM) increased the potency of <b>tetronasin</b> when [Na(+) ] was low.

The resulting culture, B. ruminicola M 384 /Tn(R), was then maintained in medium containing 0. 1 -mu-g tetronasin/ml. Growth of the parent strain was eliminated by the addition of 0. 1 -mu-g tetronasin/ml, but the growth rate of B. ruminicola M 384 /Tn(R), which grew more slowly than the parent strain, was unaffected by adding <b>tetronasin.</b> Bacteroides ruminicola M 384 /Tn(R) retained its resistance to <b>tetronasin</b> even after repeated subculture {{in the absence of the}} ionophore, suggesting that a mutation had occurred. The absence of plasmids in individual colonies of B. ruminicola M 384 /Tn(R) implied that the mutation was chromosomal. Bacteroides ruminicola M 384 /Tn(R) was also more resistant to the ionophores monensin and lasalocid and, to a lesser degree, to the antibiotic avoparcin than B. ruminicola M 384. Binding of [C- 14]tetronasin to B. ruminicola M 384 /Tn(R) was lower than binding of the ionophore to the parent stain, and this difference was eliminated by washing cells with EDTA. The peptidolytic activity of B. ruminicola M 384 towards triphenylalanine (M(r) = 460) was unaffected in B. ruminicola M 384 /Tn(R), but the rate of breakdown of tetraphenylalanine (M(r) = 607) was decreased. This difference was also abolished by EDTA. It was concluded that growth of B. ruminicola in the presence of <b>tetronasin</b> resulted in a mutation affecting the permeability of the cell envelope, such that permeation of <b>tetronasin</b> and molecules of a similar size (M(r) = 628) was decreased.

Journal of Agricultural Science, 115 (2), 285 - 290. Ionophores and inhibitors of bacterial energy metabolism {{were added to}} mixed rumen bacteria prepared from sheep receiving grass hay plus concentrate diets, and their influence on the rate of metabolism of alanine (Ala) peptides was determined. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) had no influence on the rate of breakdown of Ala 2, Ala 3, Ala 4 or Ala 5, indicating that the metabolism of these peptides did not require ATP. The protonophores tetrachlorosalicylanilide (TCS) and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone (CCCP) inhibited peptide breakdown to a minor extent (< 15 %), whereas the ionophores monensin and <b>tetronasin</b> had greater, but still small (12 ? 31 %), inhibitory effects. Toluene stimulated peptide breakdown, consistent with a permeability barrier having been removed. Thus, at least some peptide metabolism depends on transport into bacteria; transport appears not to be ATP-linked, and may well be coupled to the uptake of mineral cations rather than protons. Rumen fluid from sheep receiving a similar diet with added monensin (33 mg/kg) or <b>tetronasin</b> (10 mg/kg) hydrolysed Ala 3 and Ala 4 at rates that {{did not differ significantly}} from controls.

The {{final step}} in the {{conversion}} of protein to amino acids by the common Gram-negative rumen bacterium, Prevotella (formerly Bacteroides) ruminicola, is the cleavage of di- and tripeptides. Dipeptidase and tripeptidase activities were predominantly cytoplasmic, and toluene treatment increased the rate of Ala(2) and Ala(3) hydrolysis by whole cells, suggesting that transport limited the rate of hydrolysis of extracellular di- and tripeptides. The hydrolysis of Ala(2) and Ala(3) by whole cells was not affected by protonophores, ionophores or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, but Ala(2) hydrolysis by EDTA-treated cells was inhibited by the Ca 2 +/H+ ionophore, <b>tetronasin.</b> Ala(3) hydrolysis was not affected by protonophores or ionophores in EDTA-treated cells. The dipeptidase of strain M 384 was inhibited > 99 % by 1, 10 -phenanthroline and 39 % by EDTA but not other protease inhibitors, consistent with the enzyme being a metalloprotease. Tripeptidase was insensitive to protease inhibitors, except for a 33 % inhibition by EDTA. Cleavage of tripeptides occurred at the bond adjacent to the N-terminal amino acid. Distinct di-, tri and oligopeptidase peaks were obtained by anion-exchange Liquid chromatography of disrupted cells. Banding patterns on native PAGE using activity staining also indicated that P. ruminicola M 384 had separate single dipeptidase and tripeptidase enzymes which hydrolysed a range of peptides. The dipeptidase of strain M 384 was different from other strains of P. ruminicola: strains GA 33 and B(1) 4 had activities which ran at the same R(f); strain GA 33 had another band of lower activity; strain 23 had two bands {{different from those of}} the other strains. The tripeptidases ran at the same R(f) for the different strains. Dipeptidase activity of all strains was inhibited by 1, 10 -phenanthroline on gels. Gel permeation chromatography indicated that the M(r) of the dipeptidases from strains M 384 and B(1) 4 were 115 000 and 114 500 respectively, and 112 500 and 121 500 for the corresponding tripeptidases. Thus the metabolism of small peptides by P. ruminicola involves separate permeases and intracellular peptidases for di- and tripeptides. (C) 1995 Academic PressPeer reviewe...|$|E
