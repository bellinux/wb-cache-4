5|$|Philip {{began the}} siege, but was {{frustrated}} {{in his attempt}} to <b>take</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> the siege dragged on for nearly a year. During this time, there were two failed Athenian attempts to relieve the city. Philip was to lose an eye during the siege when he was hit by an arrow. Despite the injury inflicted on him by the defenders, he eventually agreed terms with the citizens of Methone, allowing them all to depart with one garment each. Buckler suggests that this lenient settlement may have been the result of the Thessalian request to intervene in the Sacred War (see below); anxious not to miss this opportunity, Philip sought to end the siege as quickly as possible.|$|E
5|$|Power, the {{defending}} champion of the Honda Indy Edmonton, won the pole position by posting the fastest lap in qualifying. In the race, Power maintained the first position {{throughout most of the}} event but was passed by teammate Hélio Castroneves with eighteen laps remaining. On the race's final restart on lap 92, Power attempted to reclaim the lead from Castroneves but the latter defended his position and was issued with a drive-through penalty. He chose not to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> was demoted to tenth and the victory was awarded to Dixon.|$|E
5|$|So {{direction}} 0 {{indicates the}} worm continues to travel straight ahead, direction 1 indicates the worm {{will make a}} right turn of 60° and similarly for the other directions. The worm cannot travel in direction 3 {{because that is the}} gridline it has just traversed. Thus a worm with rule {1,0,5,1} decides to travel in direction 1 the first time it has to make a choice, in direction 0 the next time it has to make a choice and so on. If there is only one available gridline, the worm {{has no choice but to}} <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> this is usually not explicitly listed.|$|E

5|$|In 991 he {{provided}} military {{assistance to the}} Hamdanid emir of Aleppo, Sa'd al-Dawla, which enabled the latter to defeat the rebel Bakjur, who with Fatimid help tried to seize Aleppo. Early in the next year, a Fatimid army under Manjutakin advanced on Aleppo. Manjutakin sent a messenger to Bourtzes, claiming that his conflict was with Aleppo, and did not involve the Byzantines, but Bourtzes had the messenger arrested. After defeating the Hamdanids in battle near Apamea, Manjutakin laid siege to Aleppo for 33 days, after which he left part of his forces behind and led the rest to confront Bourtzes, who was marching to the city's aid. At the ensuing battle at Siderophygon (Arabic Jisr al-Hadith) Bourtzes and his men were defeated. Manjutakin followed up his success by capturing the fortress of Imm, commanded by Bourtzes' nephew, and taking him and 300 troops prisoner, before embarking on a plundering raid through Byzantine territory as far as Germanikeia (Ar. Mar'ash). The Fatimid general returned to Aleppo, {{but was unable to}} <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> withdrew later in the year. At about the same time, the Muslim population of Laodicea, Antioch's seaport, rose in revolt, but Bourtzes was able to put it down and deported the populace to the interior of Byzantine territory in Asia Minor.|$|E
5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E
5|$|The Mint then struck silver or gold in {{response}} to deposits by those holding bullion, and made little profit from those transactions. By the 1840s, profits, or seignorage, from monetizing copper into cents helped fund the Mint. In 1849, copper prices rose sharply, causing the Department of the Treasury to investigate possible alternatives to the large one-cent pieces. The cent was unpopular in trade; as {{it was not a}} legal tender, nobody had to <b>take</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> banks and merchants often refused it. The cent was disliked for its large size as well. In 1837, the eccentric New York chemist Lewis Feuchtwanger had experimented with a smaller cent size in making model coins as part of a plan to sell his alloy (similar to base-metal German silver) to the government for use in coinage. His pieces circulated as hard times tokens in the recession years of the late 1830s and early 1840s.|$|E

The rushing water nearly drowns him, but Homer arrives and pulls {{him out of the}} water, saving Mr. Burns's life. To reward him, Mr. Burns offers to take Homer out to dinner. Homer says he likes Chicago deep dish pizza, so Mr. Burns takes him to Chicago on his private plane. On the plane, Homer is treated with luxury and gets serenaded by Lionel Richie. Homer has the time of his life in Chicago, but he becomes depressed on the return trip because he does not have the plane. Back in Springfield, Homer tells Marge that he is tired of being a normal person and becomes depressed. Marge, pitying for Homer, decides to help and hires him a life coach named Colby Kraus (Stephen Colbert), who will help with Homer's dream. Colby starts right away in his treatment with Homer by videotaping his every move. At the bowling alley and after watching Homer's daily habits for a few days, Colby realizes that bowling is the one thing Homer is good at and enjoys doing. He instructs Homer to wear his bowling shoes everywhere he goes to help instill confidence in everything he does. The bowling shoes work, Homer becomes a new man, and as a result he receives numerous new job offers. Homer decides to only go for an interview at Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing because he would be required to fly in the company jet as part of his new job, however, the Rich Texan does not hire him.|$|E

25|$|The Siege of Corfu (1537) was {{the first}} great siege by the Ottomans. It began on 29 August 1537, with 25,000 {{soldiers}} from the Ottoman fleet landing and pillaging the island and taking 20,000 hostages as slaves. Despite the destruction wrought on the countryside, the city castle held out in spite of repeated attempts over twelve days to <b>take</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> the Turks left the island unsuccessfully because of poor logistics and an epidemic that decimated their ranks.|$|E

25|$|The other quarter-final {{followed}} after with Nicole Vaidišová beating compatriot Lucie Šafářová 6–1, 6–4 to {{make her}} second major semi-final after the 2006 French Open. Vaidišová completely overpowered her fellow Czech in the first set, needing just thirty minutes to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> compiling a 14–4 winner to unforced error ratio. Although Šafářová gave more of a battle in the second set, Vaidišová was still too good for her and managed to close out the one hour eleven-minute match with ease. In the semi-finals she will face Serena Williams, the first meeting between the pair.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} Lombard {{contingent}} had left Nicomedia, a separate force under William II of Nevers arrived at Constantinople. He had crossed into Byzantine territory over the Adriatic Sea from Bari, and the march to Constantinople {{was free of}} incident, an unusual occurrence for a crusade army. He quickly marched out to meet the others, but in fact never caught up with them, although the two armies must have been {{close to each other}} on numerous occasions. William briefly besieged Iconium (Konya) but could not <b>take</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> he was soon ambushed at Heraclea Cybistra by Kilij Arslan, who had just defeated the Lombards at Mersivan and was eager to stamp out these new armies as soon as possible. At Heraclea almost the entire contingent from Nevers was wiped out, except for the count himself and a few of his men.|$|E
25|$|At the World Grand Prix in October, King {{reached his}} first major final in two years. In his first round match against Terry Jenkins, King survived five missed match darts from his {{opponent}} to edge the game 2–1 in sets, and then saw off Dave Chisnall (3–1) and Robert Thornton (3–0 in 31 minutes) to meet home favourite Brendan Dolan in the semi-finals. King came back from 0–2 down in the first set to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> from there was {{in control of the}} match as he won 5–2 and met Michael van Gerwen in the final. King led 3–0 and 4–1 in the final, but from there on only won three more legs as he lost the match 4–6. King afterwards blamed the crowd for his collapse, as they were loudly booing his starting and finishing doubles, but the £40,000 runner-up prize saw him climb to 13th in the world.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Lothair's {{contemplated}} attack upon Roger {{had gained}} {{the backing of}} Pisa, Genoa, and the Byzantine emperor John II, each of whom feared {{the growth of a}} powerful Norman kingdom. A Pisan fleet led by the exiled prince of Capua dropped anchor off Naples in 1135. Ranulf joined Robert and Sergius there, encouraged by news coming from Sicily that Roger was fatally ill or even already dead. The important fortress of Aversa, among others, passed to the rebels and only Capua resisted, under the royal chancellor, Guarin. On June 5, however, Roger disembarked in Salerno, much to the surprise of all the mainland provinces. The royal army, split into several forces, easily conquered Aversa and even Alife, the base of the natural rebel leader, Ranulf. Most of the rebels took refuge in Naples, which was besieged in July, but despite poor health conditions within the city, Roger was not able to <b>take</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> returned to Messina late in the year.|$|E
25|$|In Tutrakan the {{citizens}} allowed the Turks {{to install a}} small garrison but then they killed the Turkish soldiers and prepared for siege. Ali Pasha immediately burned the surrounding fields and soon the starving town had to surrender. After this success they advanced to the west towards Nicopolis, {{one of the strongest}} Bulgarian fortresses along the Danube. The defence was organized by Ivan Shishman who was currently in the town. Although the Ottomans had nearly 30,000 men they could not <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> Ali Pasha had to seek reinforcements from Murad himself. According to Seadeddin the Sultan marched to Nikopol with an enormous army firmly decided to seize the town at all costs. When Ivan Shishman faced the new enemy he sought a truce. Murad agreed and the Bulgarians saved Nikopol but were forced to cede another key Danubian fortress, Dorostolon. However, when Ali Pasha reached Silistra, the Bulgarians refused to surrender the town. Murad besieged Nikopol for a second time and this time Ivan Shishman agreed to the Ottoman conditions and a Turkish garrison was installed in Silistra.|$|E
25|$|In {{the opening}} leg, Lyon, at the onset, quickly forced a strong attacking pace {{into the game}} {{catching}} an unexpected Belgian side off guard. In just the 8th minute, Lyon were awarded a free kick and it was easily converted by Miralem Pjanić, his first ever goal with the club. The home side continued their attack forcing the Belgians to hold off their attack and focus more on defending. Despite Anderlecht's intent, in the 14th minute, Lyon were awarded a penalty by referee Wolfgang Stark after Lisandro López, on a breakaway, was taken down in the box by Anderlecht goalkeeper Silvio Proto. Having won the penalty, López stepped up to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> converted giving Lyon a 2–0 lead in just 15 minutes of play. Throughout the first half, Lyon continued to control the match, at one point, having 65% of the possession. Their continued attack paid off with an amazing left-footed rocket shot from Michel Bastos in the 39th minute. Just three minutes later, Lyon converted again through Bafétimbi Gomis on an easy shot {{just in front of}} goal following a nice pass from López. The goal gave Lyon a 4–0 heading into the halftime. Lyon came out for the second half in completely opposite fashion compared to the first. This allowed Anderlecht to finally get some play on the ball. Just 14 minutes into the second half, Anderlecht got their first goal from the Argentine Matías Suárez, who beat both Mathieu Bodmer and Hugo Lloris to the ball and eventually pushed it {{into the back of the}} net. Just five minutes later, however, Lyon would regain their four-goal lead with Gomis scoring his second of the match following the Belgian goalkeeper Proto's mistake of leaving his net open by attempting to beat the Frenchman to a passing ball from Michel Bastos. Despite numerous chances from substitute César Delgado, Lyon could not add to their defining lead and headed to Brussels with a 5–1 aggregate lead.|$|E

500|$|After unsuccessfully {{trying to}} persuade the referee to change his {{decision}} about the penalty, Fowler took it tamely and Seaman saved. However, Seaman failed {{to hold on to}} the ball and Jason McAteer scored from the rebound. Although many people believe that he deliberately took the penalty kick poorly for reasons of fair play, Fowler said at the time: [...] "As a goalscorer it's part of my job to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> I wanted to score it. I tried to score. I never missed on purpose. It just happened, it was a bad penalty." ...|$|E

[...] I felt all of a sudden so embarrassed. I closed my notebook and went to the elevator. He ran after me. He pulled me back; he sat down in his chair, and I in mine, and he began weeping.... And then, at the end, without saying anything, he simply said, [...] "You know, maybe you should talk about it." ...|$|E
500|$|London-born, New York-based {{producer}} Dorothy Berwin {{was initially}} {{attached to the}} project in 1996, owning {{the rights to the}} novel. She enlisted then-playwright Phyllis Nagy to write the screenplay at the recommendation of her London agent. Nagy, who was a friend of Highsmith, wrote the first draft of the script in 1997. Highsmith had suggested to Nagy she adapt one of her novels. According to Nagy, Highsmith was not confident that the novel could be made into a [...] "satisfying" [...] film because of its [...] "intense, subjective point of view". Nagy decided to adapt the script to ensure its fidelity to the source material, remarking, [...] "I felt a strange responsibility to <b>take</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> {{to make sure that it}} wasn't screwed up in some fundamental way, because she so disliked many of the screen adaptations of her work." ...|$|E
