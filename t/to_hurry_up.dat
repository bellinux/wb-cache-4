25|$|The British {{liaison officer}} Edward Spears later wrote that Lanrezac's {{reputation}} as an academic lecturer made him “the star turn” of the French Army. The British commander Sir John French, at his meeting with Joffre on 16 August, was advised <b>to</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>up</b> and join in Lanrezac’s offensive, as he would not {{wait for him to}} catch up. On 16 August, in exchange for the loss of XI Corps, Joffre transferred XVIII Corps to Lanrezac. Lanrezac received three reserve divisions, containing men from Bordeaux, Gascony and the Basque Country, and two extra divisions of French settlers from Algeria.|$|E
25|$|York {{realized}} his column was badly exposed because of Bussche's defeat and Kinsky's lack of progress. He appealed to Emperor Francis to allow his column {{to pull back}} to Lannoy. Permission was denied. Instead, Mack ordered Charles <b>to</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>up</b> and assumed Kinsky would do the same. In fact, Charles had an epileptic seizure and his staff refused to disturb him. In the night, Mack sent Charles orders to drop off 10 battalions and 20 squadrons to observe Lille and move with Kinsky to Lannoy so as to cover York's left flank. In the absence of their army commander Jean-Charles Pichegru, the French generals - Souham, Souham's chief of staff Jean Reynier, Moreau and Jacques MacDonald - met the crisis resolutely. Acting commander Souham instructed Moreau to hold off Clerfayt while his own and Bonnaud's divisions counterattacked the Coalition columns under Otto and York. Meanwhile, André Drut's division near Douai was asked to mount a diversion against Charles' column.|$|E

25|$|Mary {{surrendered}} at the Battle of Carberry Hill on 15 June 1567, {{was imprisoned}} at Lochleven Castle, and on 24 July 1567 abdicated. Her infant son was crowned as James VI of Scotland on 29 July 1567 and Moray was made Regent of Scotland. At this time rumours spread that Mary had abdicated {{because of the}} discovery of letters which incriminated her. At the end of July 1567, the Earl of Moray, who was in London, told Guzman de Silva, Spanish ambassador to England, that he had heard of the finding of a letter in Mary's own handwriting to Bothwell which implicated her in the murder of Lord Darnley. He had not revealed this to Queen Elizabeth. By the end of August 1567, Edmund Grindal, Bishop of London, had heard that letters in Mary's handwriting urging Bothwell <b>to</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>up</b> with the killing of Darnley had been found in a box of Bothwell's papers, and the Bishop sent this news to the Reformer Henry Bullinger in Geneva.|$|E
500|$|In November2007, Usher {{hoped to}} release his fifth album, titled Here I Stand, but [...] "issues in his {{personal}} life" [...] delayed the album. According to reports, Usher has {{to spend more time}} with his then-pregnant wife. The expected November release date was booked to coincide with that of Usher's fragrance line. Released on May13,2008. The continually changing release dates became frustrating for Usher; Dupri said to Billboard, [...] "The last couple [...] times I've been around , you could tell he's got the bug <b>to</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>up</b> and put this record out. He wants to get back out here and give the people that. He's got that itch." [...] Here I Stand was first released by LaFace Records in Mexico and several European countries on May13,2008; releases in other countries followed.|$|E
500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Deep, Deep Trouble" [...] {{illustrates}} the things Bart raps {{about in the}} song, showing how he is forced by Homer to mow the lawn after throwing a buzzing alarm clock at his father in his sleep. When Homer tells Bart <b>to</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>up,</b> Bart accidentally runs over the sprinkler {{and as a result}} he has to stay at home when the family goes to see a boat show. After they leave, Bart decides to throw a party and invites his friends. They make a mess in the house and when Homer and Marge return home, Bart realizes he is in deep trouble. Joanne Ostrow of The Denver Post thought the video was not [...] "nearly as clever as the cartoon" [...] and that it had [...] "'promotional gimmick' written all over it." [...] "Then again, I never thought the video of the dance rap 'Do the Bartman' would be a ratings hit when it aired in December. So what do I know?", she added.|$|E

500|$|Jonathan Davis said {{regarding}} {{the writing of}} the album [...] "Right after we got done touring with Ozzy Osbourne, Ross [...] hooked up with us. We went into a rehearsal studio and started writing. It was faster and thrashier. It was us reacting the vibe that we had <b>to</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>up</b> and get this done. We thought, [...] "Let's do something great, but let's not take a year on it." [...] James [...] "Munky" [...] Shaffer collaborated [...] "Some of the songs and riffs from the first record had been lingering around for years. When it was time to write Life Is Peachy, we went back into the rehearsal studio and we wanted to take the elements that the fans liked and we liked about Korn and elaborate on some of those like Jonathan freaking out. [...] "Twist" [...] came to life. There was that dissonant guitar playing. There was more of a punk rock feel and attitude that the band had. I think a lot of that came from touring so much and the energy of the crowds. We wanted to create a really angry album." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Rural Juror" [...] {{was filmed}} in early November 2006. Regarding the episode's title, Tina Fey {{explained}} that [...] "it {{came out of}} a discussion in the writers' room" [...] when she asked, [...] "you know what two words I cannot pronounce properly?" [...] After a few abortive efforts by Fey's co-writers, who also made [...] "rural juror" [...] sound akin to [...] "ruhhr-juhhrr," [...] everyone was so pleased that [...] " [...] wanted <b>to</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>up</b> and get it on the air before someone else did." [...] Jenna's film, The Rural Juror, was first mentioned three episodes earlier, in [...] "Tracy Does Conan", and referenced several times later. A running joke throughout the series was the difficulty in pronouncing the film's title, so that everyone thought it was called something different. Throughout the episode, the film was called [...] "Roar Her, Gem Her" [...] by Liz; and also [...] "Oral Germ Whore" [...] and [...] "Roaring Junior" [...] by Pete. This episode also features the first mention of Mitch Lemon (Andy Richter), Liz's brother. Mitch has a form of amnesia, named Trauma Induced Niveaphasia, due to a skiing accident in December 1985.|$|E
500|$|By this time, the 9th Division {{was about}} [...] East of Lae, while the 7th Division was [...] away and [...] "it {{appeared}} an odds-on {{bet that the}} 9th would reach Lae first". The 7th Division resumed its advance at dawn on 16 September. The last ten Japanese troops facing the 2/33rd Infantry Battalion were killed and the 2/25th Infantry Battalion passed through its position and headed for Lae. As they moved down the Markham Valley Road, they occasionally encountered sick Japanese soldiers who held the column momentarily. Brigadier Eather came up in his jeep and started urging the diggers <b>to</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>up.</b> They were unimpressed. Eather, armed with a pistol, then acted as leading scout, with his troops following in a column of route behind him. The column entered Lae unopposed by the Japanese but aircraft of the Fifth Air Force strafed the 2/33rd Infantry Battalion and dropped parachute fragmentation bombs, wounding two men. Whitehead soon received a message sent in the clear from Vasey that read: [...] "Only the Fifth Air Force bombers are preventing me from entering Lae." [...] By early afternoon, the 2/31st Infantry Battalion reached the Lae airfield where it killed 15 Japanese soldiers and captured one. The 25th Infantry Brigade then came under fire from the 9th Division's 25-pounders, wounding one soldier. Vasey and Eather tried every available means to inform Wootten of the situation. A message eventually reached him through RAAF channels at 14:25 and the artillery was silenced.|$|E
