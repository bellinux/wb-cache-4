40|$|PURPOSE: Evaluate {{the initial}} {{experience}} of laparoscopic <b>ureteral</b> reimplant <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stenosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2004 to June 2008, 10 patients underwent 11 laparoscopic reconstruction surgeries <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stenosis. Seven cases of stenosis of the distal ureter, {{two at the}} level of iliac vessels, a case of bilateral distal stenosis and one in the medium third. Eight ureteroneocystotomies were performed by extravesical technique with anti-reflux mechanism, two cases of vesical reimplant with Boari technique and one case using the psoas hitch technique. RESULTS: The average surgical time was 166 minutes (115 - 245 min), mean blood loss was 162 mL (100 - 210 mL) and the average hospital stay was 2. 9 days (2 - 4 days). There were two complications: a lesion of the sigmoid colon identified peroperatively and treated with laparoscopic sutures with good evolution, and a case of ureteral stone obstruction at the 30 th day postoperative, treated by laser ureterolitotripsy. All patients had resolution of the stenosis at an average follow-up period of 18 months (3 - 54 months).

40|$|Background: There {{are many}} options for urologists to treat {{ureteral}} stones {{that range from}} 8 mm to 15 mm, including ESWL and ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy. While both ESWL and ureteroscopy are effective and minimally invasive procedures, there is still controversy over {{which one is more}} suitable <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stones. Objective: To perform a retrospective study to compare the efficiency, safety and complications using ESWL vs. ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy in management of ureteral stones. Methods: Between October 2010 and October 2012, 160 patients who underwent ESWL or ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy at Suzhou municipal hospital for a single radiopaque ureteral stone (the size 8 – 15 mm) were evaluated. All patients were followed up with ultrasonography for six months. Stone clearance rate, costs and complications were compared. Results: Similarity in stone clearance rate and treatment time between the two procedures; overall procedural time, analgesia requirement and total cost were significantly different. Renal colic and gross hematuria were more frequent with ESWL while voiding symptoms were more frequent with ureteroscopy. Both procedures used <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stones ranging from 8 to 15 mm were safe and minimally invasive. Conclusion: ESWL remains first line therapy <b>for</b> proximal <b>ureteral</b> stones while ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy cost...|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} of ureteral stones in children {{is becoming more}} {{similar to that in}} adults. A number of factors {{must be taken into account}} when selecting one′s choice of therapy <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stone in children such as the size of the stone, its location, its composition, and urinary tract anatomy. Endoscopic lithotripsy in children has gradually become a major technique for the treatment of ureteral stones. The stone-free rate following urteroscopic lithotripsy <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stones has been reported in as high as 98. 5 - 100 %. The safety and efficacy of Holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy make it the intracorporeal lithotriptor of choice. Given its minimally invasive features, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) has become a primary mode of treatment for the pediatric patients with reno-ureteral stones. Stone-free rates have been reported from 59 % to 91 % although some patients will require more than one treatment session for stone clearance. It appears that the first-line of therapy in the child with distal and mid-ureteral stones should be ureteroscopic lithotripsy. While ESWL is still widely considered the first-line therapy <b>for</b> proximal <b>ureteral</b> calculi, there is an increasing body of evidence that shows that endoscopic or ESWL are equally safe and efficacious in those clinical scenarios. Familiarity with the full spectrum of endourological techniques facilitates a minimally invasive approach to pediatric ureteral stones...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{report the}} procedure, {{postoperative}} outcome and complications {{of a new}} technique <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> implantation {{by means of a}} three-stitch ureteroneocystostomy in dogs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical records of dogs requiring ureteral implantation between April 2007 and June 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Data retrieved included signalment, preoperative biochemistry results, details of the surgical procedure, perioperative and postoperative complications, postoperative biochemistry results and outcome. RESULTS: Nine dogs fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Follow-up times ranged from 10 to 79 months (median 30 months), with 8 of 9 dogs having an excellent long-term outcome and no major postoperative complications. One dog with follicular cystitis as a comorbidity developed obstruction from inflammatory granuloma and required revision surgery. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The three-stitch technique <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> implantation compares favourably to previously documented techniques in terms of outcome and complication rates. Reduced tissue handling and a decreased volume of suture material may be beneficial for healing. The technique is also faster than previously described options, which may be of benefit in unstable patients requiring ureteral implantation due to traumatic injury or rupture...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} patients' characteristics, {{surgical procedure}} data, and outcomes of ureterorenoscopy (URS) stone treatment {{in patients with}} a horseshoe kidney (HSK), ectopic kidney (EK), and malrotated kidney (MK). MATERIALS AND METHODS This study is a subanalysis of the Clinical Research Office of the Endourological Society URS Global Study, which was a prospective multicenter observational study, collecting data on URS stone treatment from consecutive patients over a 1 -year period. A total of 114 centers in 32 countries participated. This analysis acuminated on URS stone treatment in the specified renal anomalies: HSK, EK, and MK. For each group, patient characteristics, operation data, and treatment outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS Of the 11, 885 patients included in the Clinical Research Office of the Endourological Society URS study, 43 patients had HSK, 27 EK, and 16 MK. The stone-free rate (SFR) in the HSK group was 77 % for renal stones and 85 % <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stones. In the HSK group, the intraoperative complication rate was 11. 6 % and the postoperative complication rate was 7 %, including 1 Clavien grade IIIa and 1 IIIb complication. In the EK group, the SFR was 20 % for renal stones and 94 % <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stones, with an intraoperative complication rate of 14. 8 % and a postoperative complication rate of 7. 4 %. One Clavien IVa complication was reported. In the MK group, the SFR was 71 % for renal stones and 88 % <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stones, with an intraoperative complication rate of 6. 3 %. No postoperative complications occurred in this group. CONCLUSION URS is an effective and safe treatment modality to remove ureteral and renal stones in patients with HSK and MK. The effectiveness of URS for renal stones in EK was low. (C) 2017 Elsevier In...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives: The holmium laser has a short {{absorption}} {{depth in}} tissue and possesses excellent properties both in ablation and hemostasis. We have performed endoscopic incision <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stricture using the holmium laser through a small-caliber ureteroscope. Methods: This method was used on five patients and seven ureters. The etiology of the stricture was stone scar in two patients, ureteroenteroanastomosis of Indiana urinary pouch in two, and primary in one. We used an 8 F semi-rigid or 6. 9 F flexible ureteroscope. No prior procedures, such as balloon dilation, were necessary {{in any of}} the cases. The stricture was incised with the holmium laser using a 365 -µm fiber through the working channel of the ureteroscope. The holmium laser operated at a wavelength of 2100 nm, with an output of 1. 0 J/pulse at a rate of 10 Hz. After completion of the incision, a 12 F Double-J catheter was left in for six weeks. Results: The mean operative time was 89 minutes. The stricture resolved completely in all cases at an average follow-up of 8. 6 months. Conclusions: The holmium laser incision <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stricture using a small-caliber ureteroscope is an easy-toperform, safe and effective procedure...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{an earlier}} study we {{demonstrated}} the feasibility to create tissue engineered venous scaffolds in vitro and in vivo. In this study we investigated the use of tissue engineered constructs <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> replacement {{in a long term}} orthotopic minipig model. In many different projects well functional ureretal tissue was established using tissue engineering in animals with short-time follow up (12 weeks). Therefore urothelial cells were harvested from the bladder, cultured, expanded in vitro, labelled with fluorescence and seeded onto the autologous veins, which were harvested from animals during a second surgery. Three days after cell seeding the right ureter was replaced with the cell-seeded matrices in six animals, while further 6 animals received an unseeded vein <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> replacement. The animals were sacrificed 12, 24, and 48 weeks after implantation. Gross examination, intravenous pyelogram (IVP), H&E staining, Trichrome Masson's Staining, and immunohistochemistry with pancytokeratin AE 1 /AE 3, smooth muscle alpha actin, and von Willebrand factor were performed in retrieved specimens. Results: The IVP and gross examination demonstrated that no animals with tissue engineered ureters and all animals of the control group presented with hydronephrosis after 12 weeks. In the 24 -week group, one tissue engineered and one unseeded vein revealed hydronephrosis. After 48 weeks all tissue engineered animals and none of the control group showed hydronephrosis on the treated side. Histochemistry and immunohistochemistry revealed a multilayer of urothelial cells attached to the seeded venous grafts. Comclusions: Venous grafts may be a potential source <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> reconstruction. The results of so far published ureteral tissue engineering projects reveal data up to 12 weeks after implantation. Even if the animal numbers of this study are small, there is an increasing rate of hydronephrosis revealing failure of ureteral tissue engineering with autologous matrices in time points longer than 3 months after implantation. Further investigations have to prove adequate clinical outcome and appropriate functional long-term results...|$|R

40|$|Purpose To {{describe}} stone-free {{rates and}} complications of ureteroscopic treatment for impacted compared with non-impacted ureteral stones and evaluate predictive variables for impaction. Methods The Clinical Research Office of the Endouro-logical Society prospectively collected 1 consecutive year {{of data from}} 114 centers worldwide. Patients eligible for inclusion were patients treated with ureteroscopy <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stones. Patient characteristics, treatment details, and outcomes were compared with regard to stone impaction. Logistic regression {{analyses were conducted to}} explorepredictive variables <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stone impaction and to analyse the effect of impaction on outcomes. Results Of the 8543 treated patients, 2650 (31 %) had impacted and 5893 (69 %) non-impacted stones. The stone-free rate was 87. 1 % for impacted stones, which is lower compared with 92. 7 % for non-impacted stones (p 1, prior stone treatment, positive preoperative urine culture, and larger stones showed to be predictive variables for stone impaction. Conclusions Ureteroscopic treatment for impacted stones is associated with lower stone-free rates and higher intraoperative complication rates compared with treatment for non-impacted stones. The predictive variables for the presence of stone impaction may contribute to the identification of stone impaction during the diagnostic process.
