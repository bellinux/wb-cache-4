5|$|Consensus has {{determined}} sea turtles, including E. imbricata to be, {{at the very}} least, threatened species because of their slow growth and maturity, and slow reproductive rates. Many adult turtles {{have been killed by}} humans, both accidentally and deliberately. Their existence is threatened due to pollution and loss of nesting areas because of coastal development. Biologist guess that the hawkbill population has declined 80 percent in the past hundred years. Human and animal encroachment threatens nesting sites, and small mammals dig up the eggs <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> US Virgin Islands, mongooses raid hawksbill nests (along with those of other sea turtles, such as Dermochelys coriacea) right after they are laid.|$|E

5|$|The station’s first {{expansion}} came in 1850 {{when the}} new East Lancashire line used new platforms staffed and managed by the East Lancashire Railway, with their own entrance and booking office in Butler Street. From 1863, trains between London and Scotland, having no dining cars, were scheduled to allow 20 minutes at Preston for passengers <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> station’s dining room. The pressure on catering staff was increased when northbound and southbound trains would often arrive about the same time. The condition of the station deteriorated {{to the extent that}} on 18 August 1866 part of the roof on the East Lancashire side collapsed injuring three people, one seriously. By then, 150 trains a day passed through the station.|$|E
5|$|The next day, {{the court}} {{sentenced him to}} {{imprisonment}} and confiscation of goods; that was challenged by Rejtan. Eventually, on 21 April, most of the deputies had signed the act of the confederation, which was accepted by the king. Troops {{made it difficult for}} the other deputies to be present in the Sejm chambers, although a dwindling number of deputies, including Rejtan, still were present. To finish forming the confederation and elect Poniński its marshal, some confederation deputies entered the Chambers, passed a motion, and were attempting to leave. This is when Rejtan, in a dramatic gesture, is said to have bared his chest and laid himself down in a doorway, blocking the way with his own body in a dramatic attempt to stop the other members from leaving the chamber where the debate was being held (leaving of the chamber signified the end of the discussion, and the acceptance of the motion). Others tried to block the passage too. Their gesture was dramatic but futile, as the leaving deputies just stepped over Rejtan, and in a commotion pushed through the others. Eventually, just a few deputies, including Rejtan, were left inside; they refused to leave, hoping to be removed by foreign troops, which would be a symbol of the foreign intervention. Around 22 April, Rejtan and the remaining colleagues left the Sejm chamber after about 36 hours of having little sleep and food (Rejtan is said to have refused <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sejm chamber, saying it would disrespect it). Eventually however, they left in return for a guarantee from the foreign diplomats that the sentence passed on him would be nullified, and no other repercussions would be carried out.|$|E
500|$|A {{station was}} first opened on this site by the North Union Railway in 1838.

500|$|Admiral Howe sent a noisy {{demonstration}} of Royal Navy ships up the Hudson River {{early on the}} morning of September 15, but Washington and his aides determined that it was a diversion and maintained their forces {{at the north end of}} the island. Five hundred Connecticut militia under the command of Colonel William Douglas had erected a crude breastwork on the American line at Kip's Bay, but many of these farmers and shopkeepers were inexperienced and had no muskets. They carried instead homemade pikes constructed of scythe blades attached to poles. After having been awake all night, and having had little or nothing <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous twenty-four hours, at dawn they looked over their meager redoubt to see five British warships in the East River near their position. As the militia at Kip's Bay lay in their ditches, the British ships, anchored [...] offshore, also lay quiet. The day was oppressively hot. At about 10 am, General Sir Henry Clinton, to whom Howe had given the task of making the landing, ordered the crossing to begin. [...] A first wave of more than eighty flatboats carried 4,000 British and Hessian soldiers, standing shoulder to shoulder, left Newtown Cove and entered the waters of the East River, heading towards Kip's Bay.|$|E
500|$|In monasteries, {{the basic}} {{structure}} of the diet was laid down by the Rule of Saint Benedict in the 7th century and tightened by Pope Benedict XII in 1336, but (as mentioned above) monks were adept at [...] "working around" [...] these rules. Wine was restricted to about [...] per day, but there was no corresponding limit on beer, and, at Westminster Abbey, each monk was given an allowance of [...] of beer per day. Meat of [...] "four-footed animals" [...] was prohibited altogether, year-round, for everyone but the very weak and the sick. This was circumvented in part by declaring that offal, and various processed foods such as bacon, were not meat. Secondly, Benedictine monasteries contained a room called the misericord, where the Rule of Saint Benedict did not apply, and where a large number of monks ate. Each monk would be regularly sent either to the misericord or to the refectory. When Pope Benedict XII ruled that at least half of all monks should be required <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> refectory on any given day, monks responded by excluding the sick and those invited to the abbot's table from the reckoning. Overall, a monk at Westminster Abbey in the late 15th century would have been allowed [...] of bread per day; 5 eggs per day, except on Fridays and in Lent; [...] of meat per day, 4 days/week (excluding Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday), except in Advent and Lent; and [...] of fish per day, 3 days/week and every day during Advent and Lent. This caloric structure partly reflected the high-class status of late Medieval monasteries in England, and partly that of Westminster Abbey, {{which was one of the}} richest monasteries in the country; diets of monks in other monasteries may have been more modest.|$|E

2500|$|Eating in the sukkah {{does not}} cause a {{parallel}} problem because many people simply enjoy eating outdoors {{in the shade of}} a sukkah.

2500|$|The {{first report}} associating it with {{megaloblastic}} anemia came in 1954 from Drs. Chalmers and Boheimer. [...] Between 1954 and 1957, twenty-one cases of megaloblastic anemia associated with primidone and/or phenytoin were reported. Most cases {{were due to}} folic acid deficiency; however, there was one that only responded to B12 therapy and one that required Vitamin C. Some cases were associated with deficient diets; one patient ate mostly bread and butter, another ate bread, buns, and hard candy, and another could rarely be persuaded <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hospital. The idea that folic acid deficiency could cause megaloblastic anemia was not new. What was new {{was the idea that}} drugs could cause this in well-nourished people with no intestinal abnormalities. In many cases, it was not clear which drug had caused it. It was speculated that this might be related to the structural similarity between folic acid, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone. Folic acid had been found to alleviate the symptoms of megaloblastic anemia in the 1940s, not long after it was discovered, but the typical patient only made a full recoverycessation of CNS and PNS symptoms as well as anemiaon B12 therapy. Five years earlier, folic acid deficiency was linked to birth defects in rats. Primidone was seen by some as too valuable to withhold based on the slight possibility of this rare side effect and by others as dangerous enough to be withheld unless phenobarbital or some other barbiturate failed to work for this and other reasons (i.e., reports of permanent psychosis.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Eliezer {{taught that}} during the seven days of Sukkot, one must eat 14 meals in a sukkah — one on each day and one on each night. The Sages of the Mishnah, however, taught that one is not {{required}} to eat a fixed number of meals a sukkah, except that one must eat a meal in a sukkah on the first night of Sukkot. Rabbi Eliezer said in addition that if one did not eat in a sukkah on the first night of Sukkot, one may make up for it on the last night of the Festival. The Sages of the Mishnah, however, taught that there is no making up for this, and of this [...] said: [...] "That which is crooked cannot be made straight, and that which is wanting cannot be numbered." [...] The Gemara explained that Rabbi Eliezer said that one needs to eat 14 meals because the words of [...] "You shall dwell," [...] imply that one should dwell just as one normally dwells. And so, just as in a normal dwelling, one has one meal by day and one by night, so in the sukkah, one should have one meal by day and one by night. And the Gemara explained that the Sages taught that [...] "You shall dwell," [...] implies that just as in one's dwelling, one eats if one wishes, and does not eat if one does not wish, so also with a sukkah one eats only if one wishes. But if so, the Gemara asked, why is the meal on the first night mandatory? Rabbi Johanan answered in the name of Rabbi Simeon ben Jehozadak that with regard to Sukkot, [...] says [...] "the fifteenth," [...] just as [...] says [...] "the fifteenth" [...] with regard to Passover (implying similarity in the laws for the two Festivals). And for Passover, [...] says, [...] "At evening you shall eat unleavened bread," [...] indicatiung that only the first night is obligatory (to eat unleavened bread). So also for Sukkot, the only first night is also obligatory (<b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sukkah). The Gemara then reported that Bira said in the name of Rabbi Ammi that Rabbi Eliezer recanted his statement that one is obliged to eat 14 meals in the sukkah, and changed his position to agree with the Sages. The Gemara taught that a desert later in the holiday may be regarded as a compensating meal to fulfill one's obligation to eat the first meal.|$|E

50|$|Dosages vary {{according}} to the age groups and the individual condition of the person, body weight and compliance to the medication and diet. Other predictors of the required dosage are sex, BMI, deiodinase activity (SPINA-GD) and etiology of hypothyroidism. Annual or semiannual clinical evaluations and TSH monitoring are appropriate after dosing has been established. Levothyroxine is taken on an empty stomach approximately half an hour to an hour before meals.
