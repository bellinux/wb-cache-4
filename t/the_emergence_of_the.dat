5|$|After Wollstonecraft's death, her widower {{published}} a Memoir (1798) of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which inadvertently destroyed her reputation {{for almost a}} century. However, with <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feminist movement {{at the turn of}} the twentieth century, Wollstonecraft's advocacy of women's equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important. Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers, and feminists often cite both her life and work as important influences.|$|E

5|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holiness {{movement}} in the mid-19th century and Pentecostalism in the early 20th century, most denominations believed that Christians received the baptism with the Holy Spirit either upon conversion and regeneration or through rites of Christian initiation, such as water baptism and confirmation. Since the growth and spread of Pentecostal and charismatic churches, however, {{the belief that the}} baptism with the Holy Spirit is an experience distinct from Christian initiation has come into increasing prominence.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{published}} {{his theory of}} evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species, overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of transmutation of species. By the 1870s, the scientific community {{and much of the}} general public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing explanations and it was not until <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} with <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second Bulgarian Empire, the Kingdom of Hungary also persuaded an active expansionist {{policy in the}} Balkan Peninsula {{from the end of}} the 12th century. To that end, Oltenia was put under the control of a Hungarian governor, who received the title of ban. The centre of the new province (the Banate of Severin) was Fort Severin (now Drobeta-Turnu Severin, Romania), on the Danube, in the vicinity of the Iron Gates. Its first ban, Luke, was mentioned in 1233.|$|E

5|$|Jogaila was {{the last}} pagan ruler of medieval Lithuania. After he became King of Poland, {{as a result of}} the Union of Krewo, the newly formed Polish-Lithuanian union confronted the growing power of the Teutonic Knights. The allied victory at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, {{followed}} by the Peace of Thorn, secured the Polish and Lithuanian borders and marked <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish–Lithuanian alliance as a significant force in Europe. The reign of Władysław II Jagiełło extended Polish frontiers and is often considered the beginning of Poland's Golden Age.|$|E
5|$|Religious peace {{came with}} <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Macedonian dynasty in 867, {{as well as}} a strong and unified Byzantine leadership; while the Abassid empire had {{splintered}} into many factions after 861. Basil I revived the Byzantine Empire into a regional power, during a period of territorial expansion, making the Empire the strongest power in Europe, with an ecclesiastical policy marked by good relations with Rome. Basil allied with the Holy Roman Emperor Louis II against the Arabs, and his fleet cleared the Adriatic Sea of their raids.|$|E

5|$|The Swiss {{historian}} Jacob Burckhardt (1818–1897) in his The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy (1860), by contrast, {{defined the}} Renaissance as {{the period between}} Giotto and Michelangelo in Italy, that is, the 14th to mid-16th centuries. He saw in the Renaissance <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern spirit of individuality, which the Middle Ages had stifled. His book was widely read and became influential {{in the development of}} the modern interpretation of the Italian Renaissance. However, Buckhardt has been accused of setting forth a linear Whiggish view of history in seeing the Renaissance as the origin of the modern world.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the elevator was also essential to <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early skyscrapers, as office buildings taller than around six stories would have been impractical without them. Powered elevators were first installed in England during the 1830s and spread to U.S. factories and hotels by the 1840s. Elevators using hoist ropes, however, could only function effectively in low-rise buildings, and this limitation encouraged {{the introduction of the}} hydraulic elevator in 1870, even though early models contained dangerous design flaws. By 1876 these problems had been resolved, providing a solution for servicing the early skyscrapers.|$|E
5|$|The genus Equus {{was first}} {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. It {{is the only}} recognized extant genus in the family Equidae. The first equids were small, dog-sized mammals (e.g. Eohippus) adapted for browsing on shrubs during the Eocene, around 54 million years ago (mya). These animals had three toes on the hind feet and four on the front feet with small hooves in place of claws but also had soft pads. Equids developed into larger, three-toed animals (e.g. Mesohippus) during the Oligocene and Miocene. From there, the tridactyl toes became progressively smaller through the Pleistocene until <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> single-toed Equus.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} {{occupation}} at Gedi has been extrapolated {{as a result}} of excavations and historical documents pertaining to its material culture, architecture, and the known history of trade linking the Swahili Coast with the regions adjoining the Indian Ocean. The settlement of Gedi occurred long after <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earliest settlements along the Swahili Coast with the intensification of trade in the sixth century. The earliest evidence for occupation at Gedi is a grave marker that has been radiocarbon dated to between 1041 to 1278, placing the original settlement of the site sometime in the eleventh or early twelfth century.|$|E
5|$|The larger islands {{have been}} {{continuously}} inhabited since Neolithic times, {{were influenced by}} <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kingdom of Dál Riata from 500 AD and then absorbed into the emerging Kingdom of Alba under Kenneth MacAlpin. They experienced Norse incursions during the early Middle Ages and then {{became part of the}} Kingdom of Scotland in the 13th century. There is a diversity of wildlife, including three species of rare endemic tree.|$|E
5|$|The most basal theropods {{have five}} digits on the hand.

Traditionally, it has been hypothesized that the digits lost were the two outermost digits, i.e. digits IV V), in {{a process known as}} Lateral Digit Reduction (LDR).|$|E
