40|$|Purpose/objective: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the influence of the 2008 xenophobic events on the structure of earnings of street traders in inner-city Johannesburg and to provide recommendations to policymakers. Problem investigated: The xenophobic events of 2008 are well documented, but absent from the literature is the potential influence on the earnings of foreign street traders. This study investigates this influence through analysis of data from before and after the events. Design and methodology: The study applies an exploratory cross-sectional research design using data from three different samples. Mann-Whitney and Chi-squared measures are applied together with exploratory multiple linear regression analysis to generate insight into the relationships between earnings and differences by origin. Findings and implications: In 2009 the earnings structure of the sector changed. In 2008 and 2010, the earnings of foreign traders are higher, whereas in 2009 these traders earned less than local traders. It is argued that the xenophobic events might have resulted in a <b>temporary</b> <b>restructuring</b> of earnings. Originality or value of the research: This study makes a contribution through exploratory findings that document a change in the structure of earnings of foreign street traders. Conclusion: A change in the structure of earnings of foreign street traders occurred after the xenophobic events of 2008. Although association cannot ascribe causality, it is argued that this change may be related to these events. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the evaluation of}} the Enterprise <b>Restructuring</b> <b>Support</b> Program in Argentina. The aim of the program was to increase the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises by cofinancing technical assistance that can be classified as either support for process innovation or support for product innovation. Although these types of programs do not primarily aim to create jobs, they are implemented assuming that they do, or at least that they do not destroy jobs. This paper tests this assumption. It compares the impact of each type of support on employment and the type of employment measured by the wages paid by firms to their employees. To control for self-selection into the program, propensity score matching and difference in differences were combined. The study found that by supporting both process and product innovation-related activities, the program was able to create more and better jobs. The effect on wages was also found to be higher when supporting product innovation activities. ...|$|R

Congregations are mostly located in Kentucky, North and South Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee, and Texas. Ministers and laity may also refer to themselves as Disciples of Christ reflecting roots in the Restoration Movement.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of software systems and system landscapes towards service-oriented architectures {{is a widely}} discussed topic. Flexibility is a frequently named goal in this context. To reach this goal, complex information systems that are transfered to service-orientation have to be restructured. In practice the restructuring requires a high manual effort for understanding the existing system and the defintion of a mapping of its elements to a target architecture. Our model-based <b>restructuring</b> approach <b>supports</b> reengineers by semi-automating this task. In this paper we describe how this approach can be applied {{in the context of}} the evolution towards a serviceoriented architecture. ...|$|R

40|$|Labor {{markets in}} the {{transition}} economies of Central and Eastern Europe underwent a dramatic transformation. Notably, this transformation took place within just a few years. Until the mid- 2000 s job opportunities were scarce and unemployment was high. But since then labor demand has picked up and unemployment has dropped substantially. In contrast to the earlier period of weak labor demand, {{it is now the}} supply side of the labor market that constrains job creation. These spectacular improvements can hardly be attributed to the greater labor market flexibility or to the more efficient matching of workers with jobs because no major reforms to labor market institutions were recently implemented in the region. Instead, the main cause was a strong increase in labor demand, as evidenced by the increase in the job vacancy rates and real wages. The surge in labor demand is likely to reflect successful enterprise <b>restructuring</b> <b>supported</b> by the improvements in the investment climate and access to global markets associated with the EU accession. For a long time enterprises in transition economies were improving competitiveness by shedding of redundant labor. Now they use productivity gains to invest, expand output and hire more workers. However, the emerging skills shortages may constrain firm growth. Thus the transition economies face a challenge of mobilizing effective labor supply. This requires improving labor supply incentives and investing in education. This paper documents the recent changes in labor market conditions in the transition economies, suggests tentative explanations, and finally suggests policies to address the emerging challenges...|$|R
50|$|After {{several years}} of speculation, the Association's second {{division}} was dissolved for the 1989 season and competition was re-combined into a single division, ending 28 years of partitioned competition. The future of Division 2 had been uncertain {{for most of the}} 1980s, and both the <b>temporary</b> competition <b>restructure</b> of 1982, and the proposals of the FORT review of December 1986 had sought to remove promotion and relegation between the divisions because the gap in both on-field performances and off-field viability between the strongest and weakest teams had widened. Talk of the imminent demise of Division 2 began following the folding of Waverley in March 1988, at which point the size of the Association had reduced to 17 teams; Mordialloc's withdrawal a month later reduced the size to sixteen. By the end of the year, president Brook Andersen confirmed that the 1989 season would operate as a single division; and, that while his preference was for a twelve- or fourteen-team competition, all sixteen teams would {{be given the opportunity to}} justify their positions in the competition.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} provide a {{theoretical}} explanation to the contradictory results found by the empirical literature concerning the effects of recent workplace organizational changes on job stability.

We then study the evolution of job stability during {{the transition from a}} tayloristic to a holistic organization. Our results point towards the importance of the <b>restructuring</b> costs <b>supported</b> by firms during the modernizing trajectory as the main factor responsible for the variations in job stability.

30|$|On the one hand, {{the lack}} of policy {{implementation}} ability {{is one of the}} obstacles to the active participation of private capital [61]. Some of those industrial policies failed to execute the policy function at the actual operational level, although the Chinese government offers unwavering financial support for renewable energy generators even as other countries scale back or <b>restructure</b> similar <b>support</b> programs. Therefore, the bottleneck of policy and financing is the most difficult aspect for Chinese private capital entering the market. In addition, excessive reliance on industry support policies created more problems for the renewables than they have solved. This itself puts pressure on the Government. Although great efforts have been continually made in this regard, the demand-supply gap of renewables subsidies was as much as 8.75 billion dollars by the end of 2016.|$|R

Nonetheless, we find evidence that the banking problems {{have contributed to the}} extended malaise of the Japanese economy during the subsequent decade. Just as the banks were slow to <b>restructure,</b> bank <b>support</b> for troubled and noncompetitive firms prevented the needed restructuring of nonfinancial firms from occurring. Thus, the strong borrower-lender relationships in Japan insulated Japanese firms from market forces and prevented a credit crunch.

Many different methods are employed to overcome these problems, ranging from vibrators and nitrogen cannons to manually hammering silos. The walls of the converging section of the silo must be steep enough to allow the flow of material {{in contact with the}} wall to achieve a compact and consistent discharge. Although existing silos could be redesigned and <b>restructured</b> to <b>support</b> reliable flow, this seldom is an economically viable alternative. When an inverted insert is correctly designed and positioned within a silo that would otherwise discharge in a core flow pattern, the distribution of forces is modified allowing movement in vicinity of the wall and therefore an even draw of material, converting the flow pattern...|$|R
