5|$|At a given {{temperature}} a {{lipid bilayer}} can exist in either a liquid or a gel (solid) phase. All lipids have a characteristic temperature at which they transition (melt) from <b>the</b> <b>gel</b> to liquid phase. In both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer, but in liquid phase bilayers a given lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second. This random walk exchange allows lipid to diffuse and thus wander {{across the surface of}} the membrane. Unlike liquid phase bilayers, the lipids in a gel phase bilayer have less mobility.|$|E
5|$|Most natural {{membranes}} are {{a complex}} mixture of different lipid molecules. If {{some of the}} components are liquid at a given temperature while others are in <b>the</b> <b>gel</b> phase, the two phases can coexist in spatially separated regions, rather like an iceberg floating in the ocean. This phase separation plays {{a critical role in}} biochemical phenomena because membrane components such as proteins can partition into one or the other phase and thus be locally concentrated or activated. One particularly important component of many mixed phase systems is cholesterol, which modulates bilayer permeability, mechanical strength, and biochemical interactions.|$|E
5|$|The episode filmed {{for eight}} days. In one sequence, Carl Grimes sparks up a {{cigarette}} lighter and drops {{it onto a}} horde of walkers after Rick creates a diversion to distract the walkers. Greg Nicotero, the special effect director for The Walking Dead, used black panels to capture {{the elements of the}} fire; this enabled them to edit the flames onto the walkers. To reduce the chances of getting burned, the stuntmen put on several layers of flame retardant suits. The first layer consisted of a dry Nomex undergarment; this was followed by several layers of Nomex clothing that were gelled. Since the sequence was conducted on multiple occasions, the stuntmen were coated with gel containing cationic polymers. The last layer was a raincoat, which would separate <b>the</b> <b>gel</b> from the stuntmen's clothing and allowed them to be engulfed in flames for several seconds without injury.|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{the present}} study were to {{characterize}} the flow behavior and thixotropic properties of sodium alginate-magnesium aluminum silicate (SA-MAS) composite gels with various ratios of SA and MAS, and to investigate the drug diffusivity and microviscosity of <b>the</b> composite <b>gels.</b> Moreover, interaction of SA and MAS in the form of dry composite was examined by using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), and a possible structure model of SA-MAS composite gel was illustrated. Incorporating MAS into <b>the</b> SA <b>gels</b> provided higher viscosity and changed the flow behavior from Newtonian to pseudoplastic with thixotropy. This was due to the formation of electrostatic force and inter-molecular hydrogen bonding between SA and MAS, leading to a denser matrix structure of <b>the</b> composite <b>gels.</b> Increasing <b>the</b> content of MAS decreased the drug diffusivity but increased the microviscosity of <b>the</b> composite <b>gels.</b> <b>The</b> denser matrix structure of <b>the</b> composite <b>gels</b> had a higher tortuosity, resulting in slower drug diffusion through water-filled channels in <b>the</b> <b>gels.</b> This finding suggested that incorporating MAS into <b>the</b> SA <b>gels</b> could improve <b>the</b> flow behavior and sustain drug release from <b>the</b> <b>gels</b> because of <b>the</b> formation of a matrix structure between SA and MAS in <b>the</b> <b>gels...</b>|$|R

25|$|In simple terms, {{electrophoresis}} is {{a process}} which enables the sorting of molecules based on size. Using an electric field, molecules (such as DNA) {{can be made to}} move through a gel made of agar or polyacrylamide. The electric field consists of a negative charge at one end which pushes the molecules through <b>the</b> <b>gel,</b> and a positive charge at the other end that pulls the molecules through <b>the</b> <b>gel.</b> The molecules being sorted are dispensed into a well in <b>the</b> <b>gel</b> material. <b>The</b> <b>gel</b> is placed in an electrophoresis chamber, which is then connected to a power source. When the electric current is applied, the larger molecules move more slowly through <b>the</b> <b>gel</b> while the smaller molecules move faster. The different sized molecules form distinct bands on <b>the</b> <b>gel.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following electrophoresis, <b>the</b> <b>gel</b> may be stained (for proteins, most {{commonly}} with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or autoradiography; for nucleic acids, ethidium bromide; or for either, silver stain), allowing visualization of the separated proteins, or processed further (e.g. Western blot).

The salts exhibited independent effects on gel properties. NaCl mainly altered breaking strength in <b>the</b> <b>gels</b> made with iota-carrageenan, the yellowness (b*) value in <b>the</b> <b>gels</b> made with kappa-carrageenan, and adhesiveness in <b>the</b> <b>gels</b> made with sodium alginate.

The effect of CaCl 2 in all the formulations was mainly to increase elasticity and lightness and decrease the rest of the properties considered. Combined action of the salts did reveal certain significant interactions, such as the interaction between sodium and calcium which affected the folding test value in <b>the</b> <b>gels</b> made with alginate and breaking strength in <b>the</b> <b>gels</b> made with iota-carrageenan, or the interaction between potassium and sodium which affected the redness (a*) value in <b>the</b> <b>gels</b> made with iota-carrageenan. Factor analysis showed the main trends in the variables tested, calcium being the salt that exerted the primary influence and contributed to the first two factors in each of the factor analyses. Each of the salts contributed to a separate factor, the only exception being the mixture of CaCl 2 and KCl in the formulations that contained iota-carrageenan, in which both salts contributed to factor 1. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
