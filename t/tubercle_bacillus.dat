500|$|Tuberculosis {{has been}} known by many names from the {{technical}} to the familiar. Phthisis (Φθισις) is a Greek word for consumption, an old term for pulmonary tuberculosis; around 460 BCE, Hippocrates described phthisis as a disease of dry seasons. The abbreviation [...] "TB" [...] is short for <b>tubercle</b> <b>bacillus.</b> [...] "Consumption" [...] {{was the most common}} nineteenth century English word for the disease. The Latin root [...] "con" [...] meaning [...] "completely" [...] is linked to [...] "sumere" [...] meaning [...] "to take up from under." [...] In The Life and Death of Mr. Badman by John Bunyan, the author calls consumption [...] "the captain of all these men of death." [...] "Great white plague" [...] has also been used.|$|E
2500|$|Tuberculin is a {{glycerol}} extract of the <b>tubercle</b> <b>bacillus.</b> [...] Purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin is a precipitate of species-nonspecific molecules {{obtained from}} filtrates of sterilized, concentrated cultures.

2500|$|Albert Calmette, a French {{physician}} and bacteriologist, {{and his assistant}} and later colleague, Camille Guérin, a veterinarian, were working at the Institut Pasteur de Lille (Lille, France) in 1908. [...] Their work included subculturing virulent strains of the <b>tubercle</b> <b>bacillus</b> and testing different culture media. They noted a glycerin-bile-potato mixture grew bacilli that seemed less virulent, and {{changed the course of}} their research to see if repeated subculturing would produce a strain that was attenuated enough to be considered for use as a vaccine. The BCG strain was isolated after subculturing 239 times during 13 years from virulent strain on glycerine potato medium. [...] The research continued throughout World War I until 1919, when the now avirulent bacilli were unable to cause tuberculosis disease in research animals.

60|$|In {{the first}} frenzy of microbe killing, {{surgical}} instruments were dipped in carbolic oil, {{which was a}} great improvement on not dipping them in anything at all and simply using them dirty; but as microbes are so fond of carbolic oil that they swarm in it, {{it was not a}} success from the anti-microbe point of view. Formalin was squirted into the circulation of consumptives until it was discovered that formalin nourishes the <b>tubercle</b> <b>bacillus</b> handsomely and kills men. The popular theory of disease is the common medical theory: namely, that every disease had its microbe duly created in the garden of Eden, and has been steadily propagating itself and producing widening circles of malignant disease ever since. It was plain from the first that if this had been even approximately true, the whole human race would have been wiped out by the plague long ago, and that every epidemic, instead of fading out as mysteriously as it rushed in, would spread over the whole world. It was also evident that the characteristic microbe of a disease might be a symptom instead of a cause. An unpunctual man is always in a hurry; but it does not follow that hurry is the cause of unpunctuality: on the contrary, what is the matter with the patient is sloth. When Florence Nightingale said bluntly that if you overcrowded your soldiers in dirty quarters there would be an outbreak of smallpox among them, she was snubbed as an ignorant female who did not know that smallpox can be produced only by the importation of its specific microbe.|$|E

5000|$|In 1943, as a 23-year-old {{postgraduate}} {{research assistant}} {{working in the}} university's soil microbiology laboratory {{under the direction of}} Selman Waksman, Schatz volunteered to search for soil-born microorganisms that would kill or inhibit the growth of penicillin-resistant bacteria including <b>tubercle</b> <b>bacillus,</b> the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB).

5000|$|On {{his return}} to Waksman's lab in 1943, Schatz offered {{to take on the}} search for an {{antibiotic}} effective against <b>tubercle</b> <b>bacillus</b> (the bacterium that causes TB) and Gram-negative bacteria responsible for other penicillin-resistant diseases. Within three and a half months he had identified two related strains of bacteria in the phylum Actinomycetes which stopped the growth of <b>tubercle</b> <b>bacillus</b> and several Gram-negative bacteria. One strain came from a mouth swab from a healthy chicken, the other from soil outside his lab. He named the antibiotic derived from these bacteria [...] "streptomycin." ...|$|E

5000|$|... “If {{we could}} only abolish the <b>tubercle</b> <b>bacillus</b> in these islands we would get rid of tuberculous disease, but we should {{at the same time}} raise up a race peculiarly {{susceptible}} to this infection—a race of hothouse plants which would not flourish in any other environment. We would thus increase at an even greater rate than we are doing at present, nervous instability, the numbers of insane and feeble-minded. Nature, on the other hand, weeds out those who have not got the innate power of recovery from disease, and by means of the <b>tubercle</b> <b>bacillus</b> and other pathogenic organisms she frequently does this before the reproductive age, so that a check is put on the multiplication of idiots and the feeble-minded.

50|$|Etiological {{discovery}} in medicine {{has a history}} in Robert Koch's demonstration that the <b>tubercle</b> <b>bacillus</b> (Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex) causes the disease tuberculosis, Bacillus anthracis causes anthrax, and Vibrio cholerae causes cholera.

5000|$|Leprosy {{was still}} a major concern during {{the early part of}} the 20th century. However, work on leprosy was {{frustrated}} by the inability to culture the leprosy bacillus in the laboratory. Twort suspected that the leprosy bacillus had a 'close relationship' with the <b>tubercle</b> <b>bacillus,</b> a species that was culturable. Twort wrote, [...] "It appeared highly probable that these two organisms would require the same chemical substances for building up their protoplasm, which could be elaborated from the ordinary media onlyby the tubercle bacillus." [...] Twort therefore incorporated dead tubercle bacilli in the growth medium and succeeded in culturing leprosy. The essential substance supplied by the <b>tubercle</b> <b>bacillus</b> that was missing from the medium turned out to be vitamin K. Twort's experiment is important as a demonstration of an organism growing only when supplied with a substance elaborated by another. This is the essential feature of all growth factor investigations and the basis of all studies of bacterial nutrition. However, this work, too, was ignored for several decades.|$|E

50|$|Robert Koch {{discovered}} the <b>tubercle</b> <b>bacillus</b> in 1882 and {{this led to}} a period of 40 years in which the medical professions debated the means of transmission and tried to assimilate this new knowledge into existing practice.

It was in 1899 that Hermann Biggs, the chief medical officer for New York City determined that transmission was caused by dust or close physical contact.|$|E

50|$|At {{the time}} Dr. Ferguson {{began his career}} at Fort Qu'Appelle, BCG {{vaccination}} was, controversial.

The idea of introducing live tubercle into the human body was considered dubious from perspectives of both health and morality. However, the reality in 1926 was that natives were ten times more likely than non-natives to die from tuberculosis. And the risk of BCG vaccination was theoretical; not proven. Dr. Ferguson felt it was justified. He was so convinced of the value of BCG vaccination that to prove its safety he vaccinated his own children, before vaccinating anyone else.|$|E
5000|$|Nikolay Nikolaevich Anichkov (Никола́й Никола́евич Ани́чков, often spelled Anitschkow in German literature) (1885, Saint Petersburg - 1964) was a {{prominent}} pathologist of Russian heritage.

In 1958, in an editorial in Annals of Internal Medicine, William Dock compared {{the significance of the}} classic work of Anichkov to that of the discovery of the <b>tubercle</b> <b>bacillus</b> by Robert Koch. American biochemist D. Steinberg wrote: [...] "If the full significance of his findings had been appreciated at the time, we might have saved more than 30 years in the long struggle to settle the cholesterol controversy and Anitschkow might have won a Nobel Prize".

5000|$|In [...] "Tuberculosis, Heredity and Environment", Pearson {{said that}} the [...] "importance of the {{discovery}} of Koch the <b>tubercle</b> <b>bacillus</b> cannot be overrated," [...] but {{he went on to say}} that this had led to a focus on infection as the cause of tuberculosis. His view was that there should have been a proper scientific inquiry as to the relative importance of the hereditary and environmental factors and of the liability to infection in the cause of the disease. Pearson had previously asserted that [...] "the influence of environment is not one-fifth of heredity, and quite possibly not one-tenth of it," [...] so he felt that by focussing on infection, the significant cause, heredity, was being ignored. Towards the end of his lecture, Pearson outlined the political ramifications of his findings: ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1882, Koch {{reported}} {{identification of}} the <b>tubercle</b> <b>bacillus</b> {{as the cause of}} tuberculosis, cementing germ theory. Koch took his research into a new direction—applied research—to develop a tuberculosis treatment and use the profits to found his own research institute, autonomous from government. In 1890 Koch introduced the intended drug, tuberculin, but it soon proved ineffective, and accounts of deaths followed in new press. Amid Koch's reluctance to disclose tuberculin's formula, Koch's reputation sustained damage, but Koch retained lasting acclaim and received the 1905 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine [...] "for his investigations and discoveries in relation to tuberculosis". Koch accepted government's offer to direct the Institute for Infectious Diseases (1891), in Berlin, a prestigious position but not the kind of institute that Koch had sought. It was later renamed the Robert Koch Institute, which remains a government organization.|$|E

5000|$|While {{trying to}} isolate the {{bacterial}} toxin responsible for tuberculosis, W.G. Ruppel isolated a novel nucleic acid named tuberculinic acid in 1898 from <b>Tubercle</b> <b>bacillus.</b> The nucleic acid {{was found to be}} unusual, in that it contained in addition to thymine, guanine and cytosine, a methylated nucleotide. In 1925, Johnson and Coghill successfully detected a minor amount of a methylated cytosine derivative as a product of hydrolysis of tuberculinic acid with sulfuric acid. This report was severely criticized because their identification based solely on the optical properties of the crystalline picrate, and other scientists failed to reproduce the same result. [...] But its existence was ultimately proven in 1948, when Hotchkiss separated the nucleic acids of DNA from calf thymus using paper chromatography, by which he detected a unique methylated cytosine, quite distinct from conventional cytosine and uracil. After seven decades, it turned out that it is also a common feature in different RNA molecules, although the precise role is uncertain.|$|E
50|$|It {{was early}} {{in the twentieth century}} that Dr. Novy began the study of trypanosomes and spirochetes, for which work he is best known.

Among his other work, he performed studies of anaerobic bacteria, investigated an outbreak of the bubonic plague in San Francisco during 1900, researched anaphylotoxin, and studied the metabolism of microorganisms—especially the <b>tubercle</b> <b>bacillus.</b> In 1905, he was selected for membership on the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Association, a position he would retain until 1930. He was the Henry L. Russell Lecturer at the University of Michigan in 1927, then in 1931 the George M. Kober Lecturer at Georgetown University.

50|$|Calmette's main {{scientific}} work, {{which was}} to bring him worldwide fame and his name permanently attached {{to the history of}} medicine was the attempt to develop a vaccine against tuberculosis, which, at the time, was a major cause of death. The German microbiologist Robert Koch had discovered, in 1882, that the <b>tubercle</b> <b>bacillus,</b> Mycobacterium tuberculosis, was its pathogenic agent, and Louis Pasteur became interested in it too. In 1906, a veterinarian and immunologist, Camille Guérin, had established that immunity against tuberculosis was associated with the living tubercle bacilli in the blood. Using Pasteur's approach, Calmette investigated how immunity would develop in response to attenuated bovine bacilli injected in animals. This preparation received the name of its two discoverers (Bacillum Calmette-Guérin, or BCG, for short). Attenuation was achieved by cultivating them in a bile-containing substrate, based on idea given by a Norwegian researcher, Kristian Feyer Andvord (1855-1934). From 1908 to 1921, Guérin and Calmette strived to produce less and less virulent strains of the bacillus, by transferring them to successive cultures. Finally, in 1921, they used BCG to successfully vaccine newborn infants in the Charité in Paris.|$|E
