40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} a new method for the automated segmentation and extraction of cardiac MRI <b>tagging</b> <b>lines.</b> Our method {{is based on}} the novel use of a 2 D Gabor filter bank. By convolving the tagged input image with our Gabor filters, the <b>tagging</b> <b>lines</b> are automatically enhanced and segmented out. We design the Gabor filter bank based on the input image’s spatial and frequency characteristics. The final result is a combination of each filter’s response in the Gabor filter bank. We demonstrate that compared to bandpass filter methods such as HARP, this method results in robust and accurate segmentation of the <b>tagging</b> <b>lines.</b> Keywords—Gabor filter bank, <b>tagging</b> <b>line</b> segmentation, <b>tagged</b> MRI images I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of our framework for the automated segmentation and motion analysis of cardiac motion from MRI <b>tagging</b> <b>lines.</b> It consists {{of a series of}} novel methods which utilize theory from image processing, deformable models and finite elements. Our framework consists of several steps. In the first step we use Gabor Filter banks and deformable models for the automatic segmentation of <b>tagging</b> <b>lines</b> and cardiac boundaries. The extracted <b>tagging</b> <b>lines</b> and boundaries are then used as input to a volumetric deformable model for the heart's motion estimation analysis. In this step we first extract parameters that can determine the difference between a normal and a pathologic heart motion. Second, using an Expectation-Maximization methodology (EM) we are able to determine a given heart's stress-strain relationship and fiber orientation. Our hypothesis is that the 3 D shape and motion analysis of the heart will allow the faster and timely diagnosis of heart disease compared to traditional 2 D methods. We present a series of segmentation, shape, motion and tissue property analysis results.

25|$|Aliens in the Attic is a 2009 American family {{science fiction}} comedy film {{produced}} by 20th Century Fox and Regency Enterprises and starring Carter Jenkins, Austin Butler, Ashley Tisdale, Gillian Vigman, Andy Richter, Doris Roberts, Robert Hoffman, Kevin Nealon, Tim Meadows, Henri Young, Regan Young, Josh Peck, J.

The plot {{revolves around the}} children in the Pearson family having to defend their vacation house against a group of aliens planning an invasion of Earth until one of the aliens betrayed them and join the Pearson children in battle. The film was previously titled They Came from Upstairs, which is instead used as the film's <b>tag</b> <b>line.</b> A video game of the same name was released as well. Aliens in the Attic received mixed reviews from film critics but was a minor box office success. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a rating of 31/100%. The film was directed by John Schultz.|$|E
