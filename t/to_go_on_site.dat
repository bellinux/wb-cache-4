5000|$|The {{first record}} of a school in Balerno refers to one set up in 1814. Its purpose was to teach English. There were 75 pupils and the teacher was paid £25 per year. In 1872 {{elementary}} education became compulsory and a new school was needed. In 1877 what is currently the Dean Park Primary School 'annexe' became Dean Park Primary School itself (the school has since moved to a different site in Balerno) and the red brick building, now Jigsaw Nursery School, was the teacher's house. Balerno was also served by St Mungo's Episcopal School. Until the 1970s, secondary education involved Balerno, Ratho and Kirknewton children travelling long distances. With the rapid population growth in the Balerno area (1000 people in 1960, 15,000 in 1995), plans were drawn up for a £4,600,000 community school and builders prepared <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>site</b> in April 1980. The Edinburgh Evening News reported a [...] "shock rethink" [...] as late as January 1980 which would [...] "examine the consequences of not proceeding with the project". The Council even considered the feasibility of expanding places at nearby Currie and Firrhill High Schools. Balerno Community High School was opened to pupils from first to third years in August 1983. The school has since expanded to accommodate first to sixth year pupils.|$|E

Community groups had also made an unsuccessful attempt to have the building's 623-foot height decreased, although Trump had initially planned for a larger building <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the <b>site,</b> and decided against including a five-screen movie theater on the property.|$|R

40|$|International audienceOur {{research}} {{deals with}} {{the development of a new}} type of game‐based learning environment: (M) MORPG based on mixed reality, applied in the archaeological domain. In this paper, we propose a learning scenario that enhances players' motivation thanks to individual, collaborative and social activities and that offers a continuous experience between the virtual environment and real places (archaeological sites, museum). After describing the challenge to a rich multidisciplinary approach involving both computer scientists and archaeologists, we present two types of game: multiplayer online role‐playing games and mixed reality games. We build on the specificities of these games to make the design choices described in the paper. The proposed approach aims at raising awareness among people on the scientific approach in Archaeology, by providing them information in the virtual environment and encouraging them <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> real <b>sites.</b> We finally discuss the issues raised by this work, such as the tensions between the perceived individual, team and community utilities, as well as the choice of the entering point in the learning scenario (real or virtual) for the players' involvement in the game...|$|R

While social media tools are available to anyone with access to Internet and a computer or mobile device, due to the digital divide, the poorest segment of the population lacks access to the Internet and computer. Low-income people may have more access to traditional media (TV, radio, etc.), as an inexpensive TV and aerial or radio costs much less than an inexpensive computer or mobile device. Moreover, in many regions, TV or radio owners can tune into free over the air programming; computer or mobile device owners need Internet access <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> social media <b>sites.</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} Wellington's Waitangi Park, through the {{specifics}} of the Chaffers Park Design Competition, in order to explore the repercussions mistrust can have on social vision and political response. In examining aspects of this competition over a piece of public land, and comparing various accounts of events leading up to it, an interpretative impasse is reached that factual explanations alone cannot minimise. Because the search for truth proves elusive, other forms of evidence must be relied upon as sources of knowledge. In this instance, an analysis of experiences demonstrates the effect differing expectations has on human interaction, ones that are shown to {{have a significant impact on}} placemaking processes and organizational structures. When debates over public land degenerate into power struggles, the issue of control is brought to the forefront of attention. It raises questions concerning who owns public land, whether it properly belongs to local authorities or the public itself. Who gets to designate how these spaces are used, and select what ought and ought not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> these <b>sites?</b> Here, the issue of representation is troublesome because so many different groups claim to speak for the public's interest, leaving the reader wondering whose interpretation to believe and place trust in. Where the perception is that democratic rights are being undermined, then doubt in the principles underpinning consultation processes soon emerges. And once mistrust becomes entrenched, organizational tinkering is not sufficient in itself to reverse a negative state of affairs; only joint satisfaction will do. But if satisfaction proves unforthcoming, then a withdrawal from engagement can be anticipated as committed individuals quit the field in disillusionment. This in turn causes a narrowing of vision and leads to uncreative political responses traits associated with acts of obliviousness...|$|R
40|$|Application of Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) {{technology}} in the Architectural Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry is gaining popularity because the technology uniquely offers the means to create as-built three-dimensional (3 D) models of existing facilities, and conduct construction project progress and dimensional quality measurements. An open challenge {{with regard to the}} use TLS for such applications is to efficiently generate effective scanning plans that satisfy pre-defined point cloud quality specifications. Two such specifications are currently commonly used: Level of Accuracy (LOA) that focuses on individual point precision, and Level of Detail (LOD) that focuses on point density. Given such specifications, current practice sees professionals manually prepare scanning plans using existing 2 D CAD drawings, some ad-hoc rules (of thumb), and their experience. Yet, it is difficult to manually generate and analyse laser scanning plans to ensure they satisfy scanning quality specifications such as those above. Manually-defined plans may easily lead to over-scanning, or worse under-scanning with incomplete data (which may require the team <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>on</b> <b>site</b> <b>to</b> acquire complementary data). To minimize the risk of producing inadequate scanning plans, some semi-automated and automated methods have been proposed by researchers that use the 3 D (BIM) model generated during the design stage. These methods take consideration for LOA and LOD. However, these are point-based specifications that do not guarantee that a sufficient amount of the surface of each object is covered by the acquired data, despite this aspect being important to many of the applications for which TLS is employed (e. g. modelling existing facilities). Therefore, this research uniquely proposes a novel planning for scanning quality specification, called Level of Surface Completeness (LOC) that assesses point cloud quality in terms of surface completeness. In addition, an approach is proposed for automatic planning for scanning in the AEC industry that takes both LOA and LOC specifications into account. The approach is ‘generic’ {{in the sense that it}} can be employed for any type of project. It is designed to generate automatic laser scanning plans using as input: (1) the facility’s 3 D BIM model; (2) the scanner’s characteristics; and (3) the LOA and LOC specifications. The output is the smallest set of scanning locations necessary to achieve those requirements. The optimal solution is found by formulating the problem as a binary integer programming optimization problem, which is easily solved using a branch-and-cut algorithm. To assess the performance of the approach, experiments are conducted using a simple concrete structural model, a more complex structural model, and a section of the latter extended with Mechanical Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) components. The overall performance of the proposed approach for automatic planning for scanning is encouraging, showing that it is possible to take surface-based specifications into account in automated planning-for-scanning algorithms. However, the experimental results also highlight a significant weakness of the approach presented here which is that it does not take into account the overlapping of surfaces covered from different scanning locations and thus may inaccurately assess covered surfaces...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{multifunctionality}} of fisheries is emerging, as fishery activities do not only providecommodity goods but have others functions (territorial and social). The capacity of fishing activities to attractvisitors in tourist areas {{is one of}} the most believable functions with respect to the multifunctionality of fisheries:Visitors like to see boats in the ports and fishes in the markets. People are sensitive to aesthetic, social,cultural and heritage amenities related to fishing activities (presence of boats and fishermen, fish landings and selling). Here, we have to deal with an almost pure public good, for which the degree of jointness inthe production of marketed goods and services depends on the type of the activity (probably stronger forsmall-scale fisheries and direct sales than for deep-sea fishing and sales auction). We tried to see if theamenities produced by commercial fisheries are valued by visitors. Do fishing activities contribute to theattractiveness of the coast? We assume that the individual choices <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> a <b>site</b> <b>on</b> the coast are a functionof attributes describing this site. Attributes selected include recreational activities, amenities of the seasideand amenities produced by fishing activities: coastal trails, marina, beach, architectural heritage, fishing boatsand direct sales of seafood caught by local fishermen. Furthermore, we used a distance attribute as a proxyof cost. We used choice experiments to study individuals stated preferences for these various attributes. Fromthe individual choices of virtual sites (built by mixing the different attributes and their levels), we analyzedthe individual trade-off between attributes. During the summer 2013, a large survey was conducted in theneighboring departments of the Channel and the North sea coasts in France, in United-Kingdom and inBelgium, on a sample of 2 000 people. A random parameter logit model (mixed logit) was used to analyzeindividual choices, enabling to avoid limitations of a standard logit model and allowing for random taste variation. We supposed heterogeneous preferences between individuals for all attributes of sites (including thecost attribute). As each surveyed people perform several choices, our data set is a panel. The analysis of thedistribution for the estimated parameters shows that for all the investigated population, every attribute contributes positively to the utility. All the selected attributes are relevant to explain the choice of <b>sites</b> <b>on</b> seaside. Estimations show the preferences for the attributes of interest (“fishing boat” and “direct sale”) are especially heterogeneous between the individuals. We used a lognormal distribution for the random parameters that enables us to calculate the moments for the distribution of willingness to pay (WTP). The estimated means of willingness to pay for the characteristics of sites are all positive. Even if respondents prefer much better the "beach” and “coastal paths” attributes, the “fishing boats” attribute is the fourth higher mean of WTP, very close behind the “architectural heritage” one. Besides, the analysis of the distribution for the WTP for the presence of fishing boats shows that for a part of the sample, the mean of the “fishing boats” WTP is reallyhigh. Surveyed people having a link with fishing (professional, recreational, family, etc.) in France, or beingnative of the seaside in United Kingdom, have also stronger WTP for the “fishing boats” and “direct sales”attributes than other people. Then, according to our econometric results, we can conclude that individualslike to see fishing boats on the coastline and that fresh fish caught by local fishermen landed and directly soldon the ports or in local open markets is also an attraction for visitors. These attributes are positive externalitiesproduced by inshore fisheries...|$|R
