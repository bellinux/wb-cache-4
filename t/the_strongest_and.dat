The poets William Blake, Wordsworth and Coleridge were amongst the pioneers of Romanticism in literature. Other Romantic writers that followed these figure further enhanced the profile of Romanticism in Europe, such as John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron. Later periods like the Victorian Era saw a further flourishing of British writing, including Charles Dickens and William Thackeray.|$|E

5|$|Harald {{was born}} in Ringerike, Norway in 1015 (or {{possibly}} 1016) to Åsta Gudbrandsdatter and her second husband Sigurd Syr. Sigurd was a petty king of Ringerike, and among <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> <b>and</b> wealthiest chieftains in the Uplands. Through his mother Åsta, Harald {{was the youngest of}} King Olaf Haraldsson's (later Saint Olaf) three half-brothers. In his youth, Harald displayed traits of a typical rebel with big ambitions, and admired Olaf as his role model. He thus differed from his two older brothers, who were more similar to their father, down-to-earth and mostly concerned with maintaining the farm.|$|E

5|$|There {{are four}} types of thunderstorms: single-cell, {{multi-cell}} cluster, multi-cell lines, and supercells. Supercell thunderstorms are <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> <b>and</b> most severe. Mesoscale convective systems formed by favorable vertical wind shear within the tropics and subtropics can {{be responsible for the}} development of hurricanes. Dry thunderstorms, with no precipitation, can cause the outbreak of wildfires from the heat generated from the cloud-to-ground lightning that accompanies them. Several means are used to study thunderstorms: weather radar, weather stations, and video photography. Past civilizations held various myths concerning thunderstorms and their development as late as the 18th century. Beyond the Earth's atmosphere, thunderstorms have also been observed on the planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and, probably, Venus.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Vera, {{also known}} as the , was an {{exceptionally}} intense tropical cyclone that struck Japan in September1959, becoming <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> <b>and</b> deadliest typhoon on record to make landfall on the country. The storm's intensity resulted in damage of unparalleled severity and extent, and was a major setback to the Japanese economy, which was still recovering from World War II. In the aftermath of Vera, Japan's disaster management and relief systems were significantly reformed, and the typhoon's effects would set a benchmark for future storms striking the country.|$|E
5|$|Women {{were among}} the most ardent.

For the Fasci the women abandoned the Church, but not the religious sentiment, to protest against the priests, who had tried to frighten them and isolate them with the threat of excommunication. In Piana the women organised a boycott of annual religious procession in protest of the priest’s opposition to the movement in 1893.|$|E

The team entered the competition in the second stage, and was drawn into Group 3, together with Argentine club Arsenal de Sarandí, Bolivia's <b>The</b> <b>Strongest,</b> <b>and</b> São Paulo once again. With a squad composed of Ronaldinho, Jô, Diego Tardelli, Bernard and a returning Gilberto Silva, Atlético dominated the group, winning its first five matches. São Paulo inflicted the team's only loss in the last match, but Atlético had already secured the best performance of the competition's group stage, which meant the second legs in further rounds would be played at home. São Paulo, as the worst runner-up of the group stage, was also the team's opponent in the round of 16. Atlético won the first leg, played at the Morumbi, after a 21 comeback; in the second leg, played at the Estádio Independência (the club's new first-choice home ground since the previous year), the team won 41 with a hat-trick by Jô to advance.|$|E
5|$|As {{expected}} from periodic trends, lanthanum {{has the largest}} atomic radius of the lanthanides and the stable group 3 elements. Hence, {{it is the most}} reactive among them, tarnishing slowly in air and burning readily to form lanthanum(III) oxide, La2O3, which is almost as basic as calcium oxide. A centimeter-sized sample of lanthanum will corrode completely in a year as its oxide spalls off like iron rust, instead of forming a protective oxide coating like aluminium and lanthanum's lighter congeners scandium and yttrium. Lanthanum reacts with the halogens at room temperature to form the trihalides, and upon warming will form binary compounds with the nonmetals nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, boron, selenium, silicon and arsenic. Lanthanum reacts slowly with water to form lanthanum(III) hydroxide, La(OH)3. In dilute sulfuric acid, lanthanum readily forms the aquated tripositive ion : this is colorless in aqueous solution since La3+ has no f electrons. Lanthanum is <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> <b>and</b> hardest base among the lanthanides and group 3 elements, which is again {{expected from}} its being the largest of them.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} of June24, Hurricane Celia {{intensified}} into a powerful Category5 storm, further solidifying it as the strongest of the 2010 Pacific hurricane season. At its peak, the cyclone attained winds of 160mph (260km/h) along with a minimum pressure of 921mbar (hPa; 27.2inHg). This ranks it as the second-strongest June hurricane on record, {{as well as the}} eleventh-strongest in the basin, and the second known Category5 to develop during the month on record. <b>The</b> <b>strongest</b> <b>and</b> first known storm of this intensity in June was Hurricane Ava in 1973. Additionally, it also marked the first time on record that two consecutive seasons featured Category5 hurricanes, with Hurricane Rick in October 2009 reaching this intensity, the second time two consecutive seasons had a category 5 hurricane was when hurricanes Marie and Patricia formed in 2014 and 2015 respectively. In the National Hurricane Center's monthly tropical weather summary for June 2010, it was stated that the accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) for the month was the highest on record, most of which is attributed to Hurricane Celia.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Betsy was <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> <b>and</b> {{most devastating}} storm of the season. Extensive damage from Betsy was {{reported}} in the Bahamas, Florida, and Louisiana, particularly the New Orleans area. It was the first hurricane {{in the history of the}} United States to result in at least $1billion (1965USD) in losses. Hurricane Carol meandered in the eastern Atlantic for over two weeks from mid-September to very early October. Impact on land from Carol was minimal. In late September, Tropical Storm Debbie developed in the northwestern Caribbean Sea and moved slowly across the region, before later reaching the Gulf of Mexico. The storm dissipated just offshore of Louisiana, which resulted in only minor impact along the Gulf Coast of the United States. The final tropical cyclone, Hurricane Elena, formed on October12. Elena remained at sea for nearly a week and caused no damage on land. Collectively, the storms of the 1965Atlantic hurricane season caused 76fatalities and $1.45billion in damage, almost entirely due to Hurricane Betsy.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Fox was <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> <b>and</b> deadliest {{tropical}} cyclone of the below average 1952 Atlantic hurricane season. The seventh tropical storm, sixth Atlantic hurricane, {{and the third}} major hurricane of the season, Fox was a small and intense Caribbean storm that developed northwest of Cartagena, Colombia, in the southern Caribbean Sea. It moved steadily northwest, intensifying to a tropical storm on October 21. The next day, it rapidly strengthened into a hurricane and turned north. The cyclone attained peak winds of 150mph (240km/h) as it struck Cayo Guano del Este {{off the coast of}} Cienfuegos. Fox made landfall on Cuba at maximum intensity, producing peak gusts of 170–180mph (275–290km/h). It weakened over land, but it re-strengthened as it turned east over the Bahamas. On October 26, it weakened and took an erratic path, dissipating west-southwest of Bermuda on October 28.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kenneth was <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> <b>and</b> longest-tracked {{hurricane}} of the 2005 Pacific hurricane season. The eleventh named {{storm and}} fifth hurricane of the season, Kenneth developed from a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone {{to the southwest}} of Mexico on September 14. It quickly attained peak winds of 135mph (215km/h) on September 18, before weakening due to increased wind shear and turning to a southwest drift. After weakening to tropical storm status, Kenneth attained a steady west-northwest motion and encountered favorable enough conditions for it to gain power and attain hurricane status on September 25. The cyclone again weakened as its motion halted, and on September 30 Kenneth dissipated a short distance off the Big Island of Hawaii. The remnants of Kenneth produced {{one of the highest}} rainfall totals in Hawaii, reaching up to 12inches (305mm) on Oahu. The rainfall caused flooding, though no major damage was reported.|$|E

5|$|In late September, Tropical Storm Gilda killed 29people after {{drenching}} northern Honduras. A {{tropical depression}} in early October {{was captured by}} a high-altitude photograph on a rocket, thus producing the first large-scale image of a tropical cyclone. <b>The</b> <b>strongest</b> <b>and</b> deadliest hurricane of the season was Hurricane Hazel, which killed thousands in Haiti before striking near the North Carolina/South Carolina border in October. It caused heavy damage in the United States before becoming extratropical and affecting Ontario. Intense rainfall affected Toronto with severe flooding, leaving significant damage. The season officially ended on November15, although another hurricane named Alice developed on December30 to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles; it lasted until January6 of the following year. In total, there were 16tropical storms, 7hurricanes, and 3major hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{tropical}} storms impacted land {{during the}} season, {{some of which}} caused many fatalities and left destruction. The second storm caused severe flooding and mudslides in Mexico, leaving at least 48dead and 43others missing. In September, <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> <b>and</b> costliest hurricane of the season, the Fort Lauderdale hurricane, left severe damage in Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi due to strong winds, heavy rainfall, and abnormally high tides. There were 51fatalities and about $160.2million (1947USD) in damage. The ninth storm, {{also known as the}} Cape Sable hurricane, caused additional flooding in South Florida and left wind damage in Georgia and South Carolina. The storm left about $20million in damage. Overall, the systems of the season caused about $184.2million in damage and at least 101fatalities.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the three}} lifeboats, the James Caird was deemed <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> <b>and</b> {{most likely to}} survive the journey. Shackleton had named it after Sir James Key Caird, a Dundee jute-manufacturer and philanthropist, whose {{sponsorship}} had helped finance the expedition. Before its voyage, the ship's carpenter Harry McNish strengthened and adapted the boat to withstand the mighty seas of the Southern Ocean. Surviving a series of dangers, including a near capsizing, the boat reached the southern coast of South Georgia after a voyage lasting 16days. Shackleton and two companions then crossed the island's mountainous interior to reach a whaling station on the northern side. Here he organised the relief of the Elephant Island party, {{and the return of}} his men home without loss of life. After the end of the First World War in 1918, the James Caird was brought back from South Georgia to England in 1919 and put on permanent display at Shackleton's old school, Dulwich College from 1922.|$|E
