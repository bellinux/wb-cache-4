25|$|<b>The</b> <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> the speeder bike {{engines in}} Return of the Jedi was partly {{achieved}} by recording the engine noise of a P-38, combined {{with that of}} a North American P-51 Mustang.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Larkin made audio {{recordings}} (in studio conditions) of each of his three mature collections, and separate recordings of [...] groups of poems {{for a number of}} audio anthologies, he somehow gained a reputation as a poet who was reluctant to make recordings in which he read his own work. While Larkin did express a dislike of the sound of his own voice ("I come from Coventry, between the sloppiness of Leicester and <b>the</b> <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> Birmingham, you know—and sometimes it comes out"), the evidence indicates that this influenced more his preference not to give public readings of his own work, than his willingness to make audio recordings of his poems.|$|E
2500|$|Ellison {{published}} {{two stories}} in the Cleveland News during 1949, and he sold a story to EC Comics early in the 1950s. Ellison moved to New York City in 1955 to pursue a writing career, primarily in science fiction. Over the next two years, he published more than 100 short stories and articles. He married Charlotte Stein in 1956, but they divorced four years later. He said of the marriage, [...] "four years of hell as sustained as <b>the</b> <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> a generator." ...|$|E
60|$|The frost rushed in, taking {{form and}} {{substance}} {{in the heat of}} the room, while through the open door came <b>the</b> <b>whining</b> <b>of</b> dogs that decreased rapidly with distance.|$|R
60|$|Smoke was {{permitted}} to question the witnesses, {{and he was in}} the middle of the cross-examination of Harding when from without came <b>the</b> <b>whining</b> <b>of</b> dogs in harness, and the grind and churn of sled-runners. Somebody near the door peeped out.|$|R
50|$|The {{system was}} less than popular in the Designs Department laboratory, due to the clatter of the Muirhead facsimile, and <b>the</b> <b>whining</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> printer, so the project was shelved. Messrs Larkby & Pyatt went on to propose several {{improvements}} using digital technology, but the electro-mechanical system was finally scrapped in 1970.|$|R
2500|$|Edward Kienholz died {{suddenly}} in Idaho on June 10, 1994, {{from a heart}} attack after hiking in the mountains near their home. He was a chronic smoker who had been struggling with diabetes, which progressively impaired use of his extremities. He was buried in an authentic Kienholz installation; Robert Hughes wrote, [...] "is corpulent, embalmed body was wedged into the front seat of a brown 1940 Packard coupe. There was a dollar and a deck of cards in his pocket, a bottle of 1931 Chianti beside him and the ashes of his dog Smash in the back. He was set for the afterlife. To <b>the</b> <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> bagpipes, the Packard, steered by his widow Nancy Reddin Kienholz, rolled like a funeral barge into the big hole." ...|$|E
60|$|She heard <b>the</b> <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> {{his voice}} pattering the Latin of the mass, {{which he was}} reciting {{backwards}} from the last gospel; and occasionally she heard responses muttered by her mother, who with Mademoiselle Desceillets was beyond Marguerite's narrow range of vision.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! I {{knew you}} to be a man, and I thought I knew <b>the</b> <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> the hound, too," [...] she {{answered}} hastily, as if willing to explain she knew not what, and then checking herself, like one fearful of having already said too much.|$|E
50|$|On 25 February 1621, Pompeius {{was murdered}} in the {{presence}} of his daughter Lucretia at Rietberg Castle in Domleschg by a group led by his opponent Jörg Jenatsch. Planta had allegedly hidden with his dog above the fireplace in the tower, where <b>the</b> <b>whining</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dog gave his position away. According to tradition, his heart was removed from his body.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Westfront 1918 (1930) {{was celebrated}} for its {{expressive}} re-creation of battlefield sounds, like <b>the</b> doomful <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> an unseen grenade in flight.|$|R
60|$|MATTHEW [instantly {{dropping}} into <b>the</b> old <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tenant]. I'm afeerd I can't afford the price, sir. [He follows Cornelius into the house].|$|R
60|$|Then {{one sees}} an enemy shell drop among the little patch of {{trees on the}} crest to the right, and kick up a great red-black mass of smoke and dust. We see it, and then we hear <b>the</b> <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> its arrival and at last the bang. The Germans are blind now, they have lost the air, they are firing by {{guesswork}} and {{their knowledge of the}} abandoned territory.|$|E
60|$|Beyond {{the last}} line of {{sentinels}} Tarzan moved quickly in the direction of Numa, the lion. The beast was lying down as Tarzan approached, but he rose as the ape-man reached his side. A low whine escaped his muzzled lips. Tarzan smiled for he recognized in the new note almost a supplication--it was more like <b>the</b> <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> a hungry dog begging for food than the voice of the proud king of beasts.|$|E
6000|$|One {{from the}} ends of the earth--gifts at an open door-- [...] Treason has much, but we, Mother, thy sons have more! [...] From <b>the</b> <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> a dying man, from the snarl of a wolf-pack freed, [...] Turn, and the world is thine. Mother, be proud of thy seed! [...] Count, are we feeble or few? Hear, is our speech so rude? [...] Look, are we poor in the land? Judge, are we men of The Blood? ...|$|E
500|$|Sight & Sound magazine, {{published}} by the British Film Institute, described Somewhere as [...] "going round in circles" [...] and noted that many viewers would [...] "write off Coppola's film as <b>the</b> <b>whining</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> privileged", but also acknowledged [...] "a delicate portrait of a still-maturing pre-teen daughter". During the 2010 National Board of Review Awards, Sofia Coppola was given the Special Filmmaking Achievement Award for writing, directing and producing Somewhere.|$|R
60|$|It was the she-wolf who {{had first}} caught {{the sound of}} men's voices and <b>the</b> <b>whining</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sled-dogs; {{and it was the}} she-wolf who was first to spring away from the cornered man in his circle of dying flame. The pack had been loath to forego the kill it had hunted down, and it lingered for several minutes, making sure of the sounds, and then it, too, sprang away on the trail made by the she-wolf.|$|R
60|$|He {{sang the}} praises of the gracious and graceful Queen Mary Beatrice, and derided 'the dried-up Orange stick,' as he called {{the hope of the}} Protestants; nor did he scruple to {{pronounce}} Popery the faith of chivalrous gentlemen, far preferable to <b>the</b> <b>whining</b> <b>of</b> sullen Whiggery. No one could tell how far all this was genuine opinion, or simply delight in contradiction, especially of his father, who was {{in a constant state of}} irritation at the son whom he could so little manage.|$|R
60|$|A man in cuffless shirt-sleeves {{with pink}} arm-garters, wearing a linen collar but no tie, yawned {{his way from}} Dyer's Drug Store across to the hotel. He leaned against the wall, {{scratched}} a while, sighed, and in a bored way gossiped with a man tilted back in a chair. A lumber-wagon, its long green box filled with large spools of barbed-wire fencing, creaked down the block. A Ford, in reverse, sounded {{as though it were}} shaking to pieces, then recovered and rattled away. In the Greek candy-store was <b>the</b> <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> a peanut-roaster, and the oily smell of nuts.|$|E
60|$|The {{immediate}} obstruction {{in his way}} {{having been}} removed, Tarzan was for setting out {{in search of the}} spoor of the girl and Smith-Oldwick, that he might discover their fate. He suddenly found himself tremendously hungry and as he circled about over the sandy bottom searching among the tangled network of innumerable tracks for those of his proteges, there broke from his lips involuntarily <b>the</b> <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> a hungry beast. Immediately Numa of the pit pricked up his ears and, regarding the ape-man steadily for a moment, he answered the call of hunger and started briskly off toward the south, stopping occasionally to see if Tarzan was following.|$|E
60|$|He was {{conscious}} of a queer lightness in his head, but he suffered no pain. His garments were dripping with blood. He {{did not know how}} much of it was his, or the Indian's. Instinct rather than sight was his guide. He grew weaker and weaker; his head began to whirl, yet he kept on, knowing that life and freedom were his if he found Whispering Winds. He gained the top of the ridge; his eyes were blurred, his strength gone. He called aloud, and then plunged forward on his face. He heard dimly, as though the sound were afar off, <b>the</b> <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> a dog. He felt something soft and wet on his face. Then consciousness left him.|$|E
60|$|Crack! {{heard the}} {{familiar}} {{music of the}} dog whip, <b>the</b> <b>whining</b> howl <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Malemutes, and the crunch of a sled as it drew up to the cabin. Conversation languished while they waited the issue.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} {{something}} happened which took his {{attention away from}} his discovery with painful suddenness. From beneath him came <b>the</b> muffled <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> a dog. He listened, holding his breath. No, he was not mistaken. <b>The</b> dog <b>whined</b> again, and broke into an excited bark. Somebody {{at the foot of}} the tree began to speak.|$|R
60|$|In the {{darkness}} Madeline {{could not see}} how many escorts her party was to have. She heard low voices, the champing of bits and thumping of hoofs, and she recognized Stewart when he led up Majesty for her to mount. Then came a pattering of soft feet and <b>the</b> <b>whining</b> <b>of</b> dogs. Cold noses touched her hands, and she saw the long, gray, shaggy shapes of her pack of Russian wolf-hounds. That Stewart meant {{to let them go}} with her was indicative of how he studied her pleasure. She loved to be out with the hounds and her horse.|$|R
6000|$|... "If faith {{were always}} equal, where would be its merit? Thou hast never been hotly chased by an infidel, Master Roderigo, or thou would'st {{know how the}} mind of man can change from hope to fear, from the big voice to the humble prayer! I {{remember}} once, in the confusion and hurry of baffling winds and whistling shot, having always turbans before the eye, and the bastinado in mind, to have beseeched St. Stefano in some such voice as one would use to a dog, and to have bullied the men with <b>the</b> <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> a young kitten. Corpo di Bacco! One hath need of experience in these affairs, Signor Roderigo, to know even his own merits." ...|$|E
60|$|Although she {{had never}} been a {{participant}} in any of the sorceries practised by her mother, yet Marguerite was fully aware of their extent, and more than guessed what horrors were taking place beyond the closed doors of the chapel. The very thought of them filled her with loathing and disgust as she sat waiting, huddled {{in a corner of the}} settle. And yet when presently through the closed doors came the drone of the voice of that unclean celebrant, to blend with <b>the</b> <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> the wind in the chimney, Marguerite, urged by a morbid curiosity she could not conquer, crept shuddering to the door, which directly faced the altar, and going down on her knees applied her eye to the keyhole.|$|E
6000|$|Miles Bjornstam, the pariah [...] "Red Swede," [...] {{had brought}} his {{circular}} saw and portable gasoline engine to the house, {{to cut the}} cords of poplar for the kitchen range. Kennicott had given the order; Carol knew nothing of it till she heard the ringing of the saw, and glanced out to see Bjornstam, in black leather jacket and enormous ragged purple mittens, pressing sticks against the whirling blade, and flinging the stove-lengths to one side. The red irritable motor kept up a red irritable [...] "tip-tip-tip-tip-tip-tip." [...] <b>The</b> <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> the saw rose till it simulated the shriek of a fire-alarm whistle at night, but always at the end it gave a lively metallic clang, and in the stillness she heard the flump of the cut stick falling on the pile.|$|E

Caption: "As a wreath floated majestically,seemingly in {{complete}} silence despite <b>the</b> accompanying <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> airplne propellors,to <b>the</b> exact center of the park in front of the capitol,fellow airmen of Wiley Post paid him the sky's last tribute Thursday. ...|$|R
60|$|Beeton remained, beaming, {{while the}} child wailed {{his way through}} a song of some eight eight-line verses in <b>the</b> usual <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> a young Cockney, and, after compliments, left him to read Dick the foreign telegrams. Ten minutes later Alf {{returned}} to his parents rather pale and scared.|$|R
60|$|While {{climbing}} a fence, I heard <b>the</b> low, eager <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> a dog, apparently from {{within a couple}} of feet of me; but on looking about me I saw nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Brother Martin," [...] he said, {{in a voice}} capitally disguised, and {{suited to}} his monkish robe, [...] "let us enter and seek alms from these poor sinners. Pax vobiscum! Ay," [...] he added, in his own voice, [...] "'tis as I feared: I have {{somewhat}} lost <b>the</b> <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> it; and by your leave, good Master Shelton, ye must suffer me to practise in these country places, before that I risk my fat neck by entering Sir Daniel's. But look ye a little, what an excellent thing {{it is to be}} a Jack-of-all-trades! An I had not been a shipman, ye had infallibly gone down in the Good Hope; an I had not been a thief, I could not have painted me your face; and but that I had been a Grey Friar, and sung loud in the choir, and ate hearty at the board, I could not have carried this disguise, but the very dogs would have spied us out and barked at us for shams." ...|$|E
60|$|Jolly {{was tired}} {{to death of}} dreams. They had left him now too wan and weak to dream again; left him to lie torpid, faintly remembering far-off things; just able to turn his eyes and gaze through the window near his cot at the trickle of river running by in the sands, at the straggling milk-bush of the Karoo beyond. He knew what the Karoo was now, {{even if he had}} not seen a Boer roll over like a rabbit, or heard <b>the</b> <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> flying bullets. This pestilence had sneaked on him before he had smelled powder. A thirsty day and a rash drink, or perhaps a tainted fruit--who knew? Not he, who had not even {{strength}} left to grudge the evil thing its victory--just enough to know that there were many lying here with him, that he was sore with frenzied dreaming; just enough to watch that thread of river and be able to remember faintly those far-away things....|$|E
6000|$|... "Stand still!" [...] he said; [...] "I {{have you}} covered." [...] It is {{possible}} that the man did not believe him, and made a swift calculation of the chances against him. In any case, he vanished incontinently, and it was a moment or two too late when Gallwey's rifle flashed. He felt the jar of the butt on his shoulder, but, as usual, heard no report. He was listening for <b>the</b> <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> the bullet and the thud which would tell him whether it had reached its mark. He did not hear that either, and, slamming down the slide, fired again at a venture. Then he heard a drumming of hoofs, and rose to his feet. It would be Leland's turn now, and he fancied his comrade would, at least, have endeavoured to place the man between himself and the fire. It was certain that {{there was nothing to be}} gained by running after a man upon a horse.|$|E
60|$|Cavanagh's {{outburst}} was {{prevented by}} <b>the</b> scratching and <b>whining</b> <b>of</b> a dog at his door. For {{a moment he}} wondered at this; his perturbed mind had dropped {{the memory of the}} loyal collie.|$|R
5000|$|Some viewers find <b>the</b> {{high pitch}} <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> color wheel {{to be an}} annoyance. However, the drive system can be {{engineered}} to be silent and some projectors don't produce any audible color wheel noise.|$|R
2500|$|Some Ukrainian-Canadian {{members of}} the riding {{association}} objected to the nomination, citing a perceived anti-Ukrainian sentiment in Blood and Belonging, where Ignatieff said: [...] "I have reasons to take the Ukraine seriously indeed. But, to be honest, I'm having trouble. Ukrainian independence conjures up images of peasants in embroidered shirts, <b>the</b> nasal <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> ethnic instruments, phony Cossacks in cloaks and boots..." ...|$|R
