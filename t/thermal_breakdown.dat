2500|$|Oil is {{generally}} {{a product of}} <b>thermal</b> <b>breakdown</b> of type I and type II kerogen during catagenesis. The deuterium content should reflect the source kerogen signal, generation fractionation, isotopic exchange and other maturation effects. The thermal maturation at the oil window can erase much of the primary signals of hydrogen isotopes. The formation of oil involves breaking C-C and C-H bonds, resulting in depletion of 13C and D in the products and enrichment in the residual reactants due to kinetic isotope effects. Yongchun Tang and his colleagues modeled this process based on laboratory-calibrated kinetics data {{and found that the}} frequency factor ratio for D/H is 1.07. Moreover, oil is also affected by the isotope fractionation from phase-change. However, the behavior of oil gas-liquid fractionation differs from water as the vapor phase of oil is enriched in D. This will deplete residual oil as it gets evaporated. Biological degradation of oil is also expected to fractionate hydrogen isotopes, as enzymatic breaking of C-H bond have a normal kinetic isotope effect. Several degradation experiments show that this fractionation {{is generally}} mild, ranging from -11‰ to -79‰. This process should also enrich partially degraded oil. Finally, oil stored in a reservoir often had migrated through subsurface (also known as [...] "geochromatography") from another source region, interacting with water. No data has been published to confirm the fractionation associated with migration, yet theoretical prediction shows that this is likely to be very small.|$|E

Detection of failures and defects,especially in early production steps, would significantlyreduce repetition of quite expensive cryogenic RF testsand retreatments of the cavities. Inspection of the innercavity surface by an optical system is an inexpensive anduseful means for surface control and identification ofdangerous or suspicious features [1, 2]. It does notprovide, however, information about material content inthe defect region, which is required for sorting out thecavities with foreign inclusions and for the localisation ofa contamination source in the production cycle. Preliminary diagnostic is usually performed during theQC of niobium sheets resorting to several non-destructivetechniques, e. g. eddy current scanning [3]. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis is widely used forelemental and chemical analyses, particularly in theinvestigation of metals. This technique, already employedduring the QC of niobium sheets [4], appears to beentitled for development of a diagnostic tool for thedetection of trace element inclusions on the cavitysurface.

40|$|The {{development}} and use of high voltage surge generating equipment are described in this thesis. Impulse equipment capable of producing and recording standard test surges up to 2, 000, 000 volts for both research and commercial testing have been developed. The present status of insulation coordination shows the need for more data on the impulse characteristics of large oil gaps. A new type of oil test tank has been constructed which permits less gap field distortion and better conditioning of oil and electrodes than was formerly possible for large gaps at high voltage. The impulse characteristics of oil gaps having spacings ranging from one-half to eight inches formed by circular brass rods with spherical ends from one-fourth to two inches in diameter have been determined. It is found that such gaps have impulse strengths which are greatly affected by slight changes in conditions of both the oil and electrode surfaces. Their impulse values are much higher than their 60 -cycle strengths and are functions of the wave shape of the surge.

50|$|Thermal {{degradation}} of polymers is molecular deterioration {{as a result of}} overheating. At high temperatures the components of the long chain backbone of the polymer can begin to be broken (chain scission) and react with one another to change the properties of the polymer. Thermal degradation can present an upper limit to the service temperature of plastics as much as the possibility of mechanical property loss. Indeed unless correctly prevented, significant thermal degradation can occur at temperatures much lower than those at which mechanical failure is likely to occur. The chemical reactions involved in thermal degradation lead to physical and optical property changes relative to the initially specified properties. Thermal degradation generally involves changes to the molecular weight (and molecular weight distribution) of the polymer and typical property changes include reduced ductility and embrittlement, chalking, color changes, cracking, general reduction in most other desirable physical properties. <b>Thermal</b> <b>breakdown</b> products may include a complex mixture of compounds, including but not limited to carbon monoxide, ammonia, aliphatic amines, ketones, nitriles, and hydrogen cyanide, which may be flammable, toxic and/or irritating.

Semilog plots of thiamin retention versus heating time at 75, 85, and 95 °C for model systems and ground pork gave straight lines with high coefficients of determination (r[superscript] 2 = 0. 95 - 0. 99) for every combination of processing parameters, which indicated that the rates of thiamin degradation were adequately described by a first order reaction rate model. The Arrhenius activation energy values indicated that thiamin in pork (85 - 93 kJ/Mole) was less temperature dependent than that in aqueous buffered model systems (100 - 140 kJ/Mole). The relatively constant activation energy over the temperature range from 75 to 95 °C, which was proved by high coefficients of determination (r[superscript] 2 = 0. 84 - 0. 99), {{is an indication that}} the degradation pathway remained the same over the investigated range;Temperature was the most important factor influencing thiamin stability. At high temperatures and above neutral pH, thiamin was very unstable and easily destroyed during thermal processing. An increase in thiamin concentration retarded the thiamin degradation rate. Reducing water activity of the aqueous model to 0. 90 by adding glycerol adversely affected thiamin retention. One of the main interests in this study was to confirm the effect of the browning reaction between thiamin and reducing sugars on thiamin breakdown.
