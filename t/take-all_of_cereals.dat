40|$|The {{suitability}} of randomly amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPD) for differentiation at the varietal and intravarietal level was tested on several hundred isolates of the Gaeumannomyces-Phialophora (G-P) complex from different geographic locations and host plants. Amplification products obtained using two decamer primers allowed differentiation between Gaeumannomyces graminis and Gaeumannomyces cylindrosporus {{and between the}} three varieties of Gaeumannomyces graminis, as well as further division at the intravarietal level. Thus, isolates of the causal agent <b>of</b> <b>take-all</b> on <b>cereals,</b> Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici were divided into six subgroups by amplification with these two primers.

40|$|International audienceWeeds {{are both}} harmful for {{agricultural}} production and {{an essential component}} of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Therefore, new cropping systems aiming at both maximising weed-related biodiversity and minimising weed harmfulness are needed. New cropping systems are now increasingly designed with weed dynamics models but these usually only consider weed densities or crop yield losses. The present paper proposed a set of indicators for assessing the impact on crop production and biodiversity of weed communities simulated with a cropping system model. Five harmfulness indicators were developed to take account of the criteria most frequently listed by farmers via an internet survey: (1) crop yield loss, (2) harvest pollution by weed seeds, stems and leaves, (3) harvesting problems due to green weed biomass blocking the combine, and (4) field infestation represented by weed biomass averaged over cropping seasons. A fifth indicator was added, i. e. (5) the increase in crop disease (i. e. <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>cereals)</b> in the presence of weeds. The biodiversity indicators were chosen in collaboration with ecologists. Two indicators reflect the weed contribution to vegetal biodiversity: (1) species richness and (2) Pielou's index for species equitability. Three other indicators were developed to assess weeds as a trophic resource for other organisms in the agro-ecosystems: (3) the number of weed seeds present on soil surface in autumn and winter to feed field birds, (4) lipid-rich seeds on soil surface in summer to feed insects such as carabids, and (5) weed flowers in spring and summer to feed domestic bees. These indicators were tested in a series of contrasted cropping systems identified in farm surveys and simulated with FwaSYs. Analyses of variance showed that the cropping system and the crop sequence presented the highest impact on indicator values. Weather scenario and pedoclimate had little effect. Antagonisms and synergies between weed-related harmfulness and biodiversity were identified with Spearman correlations. Harmfulness indicators were all positively correlated, except for additional disease risk which was at best poorly correlated with other indicators. Most weed-related biodiversity indicators were also positively correlated, except species richness which was negatively correlated with species equitability, bird resource and insect resource. Weed harmfulness generally increased with increasing weed-related biodiversity. These correlations were though weak, and others were negative, showing that increased biodiversity could occur with decreased harmfulness (e. g. trophic resource for insects vs. yield loss or field infestation). Consequently, there are cropping systems that reconcile agricultural production and biodiversity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Microbiology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. Take-all is {{the name}} given to the disease caused by a soilborne fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis (Sacc.) von Arx and Olivier var. tritici Walker (Ggt), an ascomycete of the family Magnaportheaceae (Cook, 2003). This fungus is an {{aggressive}} soil-borne pathogen causing root rot of wheat (primary host), barley and rye crops (secondary host). The flowering, seedling, and vegetative growth stages can {{be affected by the}} infection of the whole plant, leaves, roots, and stems. Infections of roots result in losses in crop yield and quality primarily due to a lowering in nutrient uptake. Take-all is most common in regions where wheat is cultivated without adequate crop rotation. Crop rotation allows time between the planting dates of susceptible crops, which causes a decrease in the inoculum potential of soilborne plant pathogens to levels below an economic threshold by resident antagonistic soil microbial communities. Soilborne disease suppressiveness is an inherent characteristic of the physical, chemical, and/or biological structure of a particular soil which might be induced by agricultural practices and activities such as the cultivation of crops, or the addition of organisms or nutritional amendments, causing a change in the microfloral environment. Disturbances of soil ecosystems that impact on the normal functioning of microbial communities are potentially detrimental to soil formation, energy transfers, nutrient cycling, and long-term stability. In this regard, an overview of soil properties and processes indicated that the use of microbiological and biochemical soil properties, such as microbial biomass, the analysis of microbial functional diversity and microbial structural diversity by the quantification of community level physiological profiles and signature lipid biomarkers are useful as indicators of soil ecological stress or restoration properties because they are more responsive to small changes than physical and chemical characteristics. In this study, the relationship between physico-chemical characteristics, and different biological indicators of soil quality of agricultural soils conducive, suppressive, and neutral with respect to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> wheat as caused by the soilborne fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt), were investigated using various techniques. The effect of crop rotation on the functional and structural diversity of soils conducive to take-all disease was also investigated. Through the integration of quantitative and qualitative biological data as well as the physico-chemical characteristics of the various soils, the functional and structural diversity of microbial IV communities in the soils during different stadia <b>of</b> <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> wheat were characterised. All results were evaluated statistically and the predominant physical and chemical characteristics that influenced the microbiological and biochemical properties of the agricultural soils during different stadia <b>of</b> <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> wheat were identified using multivariate analyses. Although no significant difference @ > 0. 05) could be observed between the various soils using conventional microbiological enumeration techniques, the incidence of Gliocladium spp. in suppressive soils was increased. Significant differences @ < 0. 05) were observed between agricultural soils during different stadia <b>of</b> <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> wheat. Although no clear distinction could be made between soils suppressive and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> wheat, soils suppressive and conducive to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> wheat differed substantially in their community level physiological profiles (CLPPs). Soils suppressive / neutral to take-all disease were characterised by enhanced utilisation of carboxylic acids, amino acids, and carbohydrates, while conducive soils were characterised by enhanced utilisation of carbohydrates. Shifts in the functional diversity of the associated microbial communities were possibly caused by the presence of Ggt and associated antagonistic fungal and bacterial populations in the various soils. It was evident that the relationships amongst the functionality of the microbial communities within the various soils had undergone changes through the different stages <b>of</b> development <b>of</b> <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> wheat, thus implying different substrate utilisation capabilities of present soil microbial communities. Diversity indices were calculated as Shannon's diversity index (H') and substrate equitability (J) and were overall within the higher diversity range of 3. 6 and 0. 8, respectively, indicating the achievement of very high substrate diversity values in the various soils. A substantial percentage of the carbon sources were utilised, which contributed to the very high Shannon-Weaver substrate utilisation indices. Obtained substrate evenness (equitability) (J) indices indicated an existing high functional diversity. The functional diversity as observed during crop rotation, differed significantly (p < 0. 05) from each other, implying different substrate utilisation capabilities of present soil microbial communities, which could possibly be ascribed to the excretion of root exudates by sunflowers and soybeans. Using the Sorenson's index, a clear distinction could be made between the degrees of substrate utilisation between microbial populations in soils conducive, suppressive, and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> wheat, as well as during crop rotation. Furthermore, the various soils could also be differentiated {{on the basis of the}} microbial community structure as determined by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. Soil suppressive to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> wheat differed significantly (p < 0. 05) from soils conducive, and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> wheat, implying a shift in relationships amongst the structural diversity of microbial communities within the various soils. A positive association was observed between the microbial phospholipid fatty acid profiles, and dominant environmental variables of soils conducive, suppressive, and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> wheat. Soils conducive and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> wheat were characterised by high concentrations of manganese, as well as elevated concentrations of monounsaturated fatty acids, terminally branched saturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids which were indicative of Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria and micro eukaryotes (primarily fungi), respectively. These soils were also characterised by low concentrations of phosphorous, potassium, percentage organic carbon, and percentage organic nitrogen, as well as low soil pH. Soil suppressive to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> wheat was characterised by the elevated levels of estimated of biomass and elevated concentrations of normal saturated fatty acids, which is ubiquitous to micro-organisms. The concentration of normal saturated fatty acids in suppressive soils is indicative of a low structural diversity. This soil was also characterised by high concentrations of phosphorous, potassium, percentage organic carbon, and percentage organic nitrogen, as well as elevated soil pH. The relationship between PLFAs and agricultural soils was investigated using principal component analysis (PCA), redundancy analysis (RDA) and discriminant analysis (DA). Soil suppressive to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> wheat differed significantly (p < 0. 05) from soils conducive, and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> wheat, implying a shift in relationships amongst the structural diversity of microbial communities within the various soils. A positive association was observed between the microbial phospholipid fatty acid profiles, and dominant environmental variables of soils conducive, suppressive, and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> wheat. Hierarchical cluster analysis of the major phospholipid fatty acid groups indicated that the structural diversity differed significantly between soils conducive, suppressive, and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> wheat caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici. The results indicate that the microbial community functionality as well as the microbial community structure was significantly influenced by the presence <b>of</b> <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> wheat caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, and that the characterisation of microbial functional and structural diversity by analysis of community level physiological profiles and phospholipid fatty acid analysis, respectively, could be successfully used as an assessment criteria for the evaluation of agricultural soils conducive, suppressive, and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> wheat, as well as in crop rotation systems. This methodology might be of significant value in assisting in the management and evaluation of agricultural soils subject to the prevalence of other soilborne diseases. Master...|$|R

40|$|Natural suppressiveness <b>of</b> soils to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> wheat, {{referred}} to as take-all decline (TAD), occurs worldwide, It has been postulated that different microbial genera and mechanisms are responsible for TAD in soils from different geographical regions. In growth chamber experiments,,we demonstrated that fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. that produce the antibiotic 2, 4 -diacetylphloroglucinol (2, 4 -DAPG) {{play a key role}} in the natural suppressiveness of two Dutch TAD soils. First, 2, 4 -DAPG-producing fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. were present on roots of wheat grown in both of the TAD soils at densities at or above the threshold density required to control <b>take-all</b> <b>of</b> wheat; in a complementary take-all conducive soil, population densities of 2, 4 -DAPG-producing Pseudomonas spp. were below this threshold level. Second, introduction of 2, 4 -DAPG-producing strain SSB 17, a representative of the dominant geriotypic group found in the Dutch TAD soils, into the take-all conducive soil at population densities similar to the densities, of indigenous 2, 4 -DAPG producers found in TAD soils provided control <b>of</b> <b>take-all</b> similar to that observed in the TAD soil, Third, a mutant of strain SSB 17 deficient in 2, 4 -DAPG production was not able to control <b>take-all</b> <b>of</b> wheat, indicating that 2, 4 -DAPG is a key determinant in take-all suppression, These results show that in addition to the physicochemically different TAD soils from Washington State, 2, 4 -DAPG-producing fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. are also a key component of the natural suppressiveness found in Dutch TAD soils. Furthermore, it is the first time since the initial studies of Gerlagh (1968) that at least part of the mechanisms and microorganisms that operate in Dutch TAD soils are identified. Although quantitatively similar, the genotypic composition of 2, 4 -DAPG-producing Pseudomonas spp. varied between the Dutch TAD soils and the TAD soils from Washington State...|$|R
40|$|<b>Take-all</b> <b>of</b> wheat {{is caused}} by a soil-borne fungus (Gaeumannomvces gramlnls var. trltld), which attacks the roots and {{develops}} in patches, It {{is one of the most}} cammon wheat diseases, notably affecting second and third crops of wheat, leading to major yield losses. Its development depends on numerous factors linked to crop sequences, cultivation techniques, climate and soil type. So far, growers have limited options to prevent the severity of damage caused by take-all to winter wheat crops. Chemical control methods exist, based on the treatment of seeds but have partial efficacy only. Some cultivation techniques are known to reduce take-all incidence and severity and limit its impact on yield but none of them constitutes an efficient method of control on itself. To achieve economically Significant control of this disease, there is thus a need for combining appropriate techniques (cropping practices, fungicide treatment), although with partial efficacy, but showing complementary effects in order to achieve efficient management strategies. Up to now, no decision making tool has been developed to define such management strategy leading to integrated control <b>of</b> <b>take-all</b> <b>of</b> wheat. INRA scientists have used a database containing information from 2 S experiments where 2 to 24 cropping systems were tested between 1992 and 2003, to develop 16 models which could predict the incidence of the disease as a function of variables related to the cropping system, soil and climate. They finally chose only three of these models for practical use. These models were combined with a yield simulation module calculating yield loss as a function of the incidence <b>of</b> <b>take-all</b> <b>of</b> wheat. The full models were then used to illustrate a series of applications aimed at answering practical questions which would be of interest to technical institutes and crop protection advisors, such as: the planning of fungicide treatments, comparison of the impact of different crop sequences or crop management on Incidence of the disease and yield losses. These models simulate the dynamics of the disease at the field scale and enable identification of the combinations of farming practices which could limit the effects <b>of</b> <b>take-all,</b> even in a situation favourable to the disease.
