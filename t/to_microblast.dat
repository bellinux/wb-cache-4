40|$|In this {{contribution}} a novel {{powder coating}} processing technique (microblasting) for the fabrication of nickel oxide (NiOx) coatings is reported. ~ 1. 2 μm thick NiOx coatings are deposited at 20 mm 2 s− 1 by the bombardment of the NiOx powder onto a Ni sheet using an air jet {{at a speed}} of more than 180 m s− 1. Microblast deposited NiOx coatings can be prepared at a high processing rate, do not need further thermal treatment. Therefore, this scalable method is time and energy efficient. The mechano-chemical bonding between the powder particles and substrate results {{in the formation of}} strongly adherent NiOx coatings. Microstructural analyses were carried out using SEM, the chemical composition and coatings orientation were determined by XPS and XRD, respectively. The electroactivity of the microblast deposited NiOx coatings was compared with that of NiOx coatings obtained by sintering NiOx nanoparticles previously sprayed onto Ni sheets. In the absence of a redox mediator in the electrolyte, the reduction current of microblast deposited NiOx coatings, when analyzed in anhydrous environment, was two times larger than that produced by higher porosity NiOx nanoparticles coatings of the same thickness obtained through spray coating followed by sintering. Under analogous experimental conditions thin layers of NiOx obtained by using the sol–gel method, ultrasonic spray- and electro-deposition show generally lower current density with respect <b>to</b> <b>microblast</b> samples of the same thickness. The electrochemical reduction of NiOx coatings is controlled by the bulk characteristics of the oxide and the relatively ordered structure of microblast NiOx coatings with respect to sintered NiOx nanoparticles here considered, is expected to increase the electron mobility and ionic charge diffusion lengths in the microblast samples. Finally, the increased level of adhesion of the microblast film on the metallic substrate affords a good electrical contact at the metal/metal oxide interface, and constitutes another reason in support of the choice of microblast as low-cost and scalable deposition method for oxide layers to be employed in electrochemical applications...|$|E
40|$|Hydroxyapatite (HA) {{coating of}} hard tissue {{implants}} is widely employed for its biocompatible and osteoconductive properties {{as well as}} its improved mechanical properties. Plasma technology is the principal deposition process for coating HA on bioactive metals for this application. However, thermal decomposition of HA can occur during the plasma deposition process, resulting in coating variability in terms of purity, uniformity and crystallinity, which can lead to implant failure caused by aseptic loosening. In this study, CoBlastTM, a novel blasting process has been used to successfully modify a titanium (V) substrate with a HA treatment using a dopant/abrasive regime. The impact of a series of apatitic abrasives under the trade name MCD, was investigated to determine the effect of abrasive particle size on the surface properties of both microblast (abrasive only) and CoBlast (HA/abrasive) treatments. The resultant HA treated substrates were compared to substrates treated with abrasive only (microblasted) and an untreated Ti. The HA powder, apatitic abrasives and the treated substrates were characterized for chemical composition, coating coverage, crystallinity and topography including surface roughness. The results show that the surface roughness of the HA blasted modification was affected by the particle size of the apatitic abrasives used. The CoBlast process did not alter the chemistry of the crystalline HA during deposition. Cell proliferation on the HA surface was also assessed, which demonstrated enhanced osteo-viability compared <b>to</b> the <b>microblast</b> and blank Ti. This study demonstrates the ability of the CoBlast process to deposit HA coatings with a range of surface properties onto Ti substrates. The ability of the CoBlast technology to offer diversity in modifying surface topography offers exciting new prospects in tailoring the properties of medical devices for applications ranging from dental to orthopedic settings...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{deposition}} process named CoBlastTM, based on grit blasting technology, {{has been used}} to deposit hydroxyapatite (HA) onto titanium (Ti) metal using a dopant/abrasive regime. The various powders (HA powder, apatitic abrasives) and the treated substrates were characterised for chemical composition, coating coverage, crystallinity and topography including surface roughness. The surface roughness of the HA surfaces could be altered using apatitic abrasives of different particle sizes. Compared to the standard plasma spraying process, the CoBlast surface produced excellent coating adhesion, lower dissolution, higher levels of mechanical and chemical stability in stimulated body fluid (SBF). Enhanced viability of osteoblastic cells was also observed on the CoBlast HA surfaces compared <b>to</b> the <b>microblast</b> and untreated Ti as well as the plasma HA coating. CoBlast offers an alternative to the traditional methods of coating HA implants with added versatility. Apatites substituted with antimicrobial metals can also be deposited to add functionality to HA coatings without cytotoxicty. The potential use of these coatings as an infection preventing strategy for application on hard tissue implants was assessed in vitro and also in vivo. Surface physicochemical properties and morphology were determined in addition to surface cytocompatibility assessments using a MG- 63 osteoblast cell line. The antibacterial potential of the immobilised metal ion on the surface and the eluted ion to a lesser extent, contributed to the anticolonising behaviour of the surfaces against a standard bacteria strain (S. aureus) {{as well as a number}} of clinically relevant strains (MRSA, MSSA and S. epidermis). The results revealed that the surfaces coated with silver substituted apatites (AgA) outperformed the other apatites examined (apatites loaded with Zn, Sr and both Ag and Sr ions). Assessment of bacterial adherence on coated K-wires following subcutaneous implantation in a nude mouse infection model (S. aureus) for two days demonstrated that the 12 % wt surface outperformed the 5 % wt AgA coating. Lower inflammatory responses were activated with the insertion of the Ag loaded K-wires with a localised infection at the implantation site noted over the two day study period. These results indicated that the AgA coating on the surface of orthopaedic implants demonstrate good biocompatibility whilst inhibiting bacterial adhesion and colonising of the implant surface...|$|R
