5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> keep {{has been}} {{restored}} to its early 20th-century appearance as a barracks room. The second floor was redeveloped in the late 19th century to form another barracks room, with its ceiling incorporating additional early 20th-century girders and concrete to support the gun battery above it. The roof of the keep has two 12-pounder gun mounts with their original gun-lockers; there is a 12-pounder gun on display originally used on a Royal Naval vessel. The keep's roof would originally have been flat, with crenellations for artillery, but both the roof and crenellations were removed in the 1770s.|$|E

5|$|The {{suite of}} state rooms on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> east wing {{contains}} the long gallery, library, drawing room (great chamber), small drawing room and two bedrooms. All date originally from the Jacobean mansion, but {{are likely to}} have been significantly altered by John Crewe and then extensively reworked by Blore in neo-Jacobean style. They were restored to Barry's designs, usually with little attempt to reproduce the Jacobean appearance, probably because records of most of the original designs were lacking. Crace performed much of the decoration work in these rooms. All the state rooms contain elaborate plasterwork and stone chimneypieces, often flanked with Corinthian columns or pilasters.|$|E
