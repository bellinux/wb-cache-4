5|$|Studies {{conducted}} {{since the}} trans-Neptunian region was first charted {{have shown that}} the region now called the Kuiper belt is not the point of origin of short-period comets, but that they instead derive from a linked population called <b>the</b> <b>scattered</b> disc. <b>The</b> <b>scattered</b> disc was created when Neptune migrated outward into the proto-Kuiper belt, which at the time was much closer to the Sun, and left in its wake a population of dynamically stable objects that could never be affected by its orbit (the Kuiper belt proper), and a population whose perihelia are close enough that Neptune can still disturb them as it travels around the Sun (<b>the</b> <b>scattered</b> disc). Because <b>the</b> <b>scattered</b> disc is dynamically active and the Kuiper belt relatively dynamically stable, <b>the</b> <b>scattered</b> disc is now seen as the most likely point of origin for periodic comets.|$|E

40|$|A {{time-of-flight}} camera {{suffers from}} significant range distortion due to <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> artefact caused by secondary reflections occurring between the lens {{and the image}} plane. The reflected beam from the foreground objects undergoes multiple reflections within the camera device thereby introducing parasitic signals that bias the late-arrival, backscattered signals from the background targets. These additive signals cause degradation of the depth measurement for the background objects thus limiting the use of range imaging cameras for high precision close-range photogrammetric applications. So far <b>the</b> modelling of <b>scattering</b> distortion {{has been based on}} the linear system model using an inverse filtering approach. However, an experiment conducted for measuring the edgespread function using a two planar surfaces separated at some distance shows a non-linear and shift-variant behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> distortion. <b>The</b> non-linearity and the shift-variant behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> errors question <b>the</b> use of the linear shiftinvariant system for reversing <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> effect. Further experimentation using two planar surfaces at different distances with different surface areas of <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> object was conducted to heuristically quantify the range and amplitude biases caused by <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> artefact. <b>The</b> range and amplitude biases were analysed {{as a function of the}} distance of <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> object from <b>the</b> camera, the surface area of <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> object and <b>the</b> integration time.

5|$|Comets {{are thought}} to have two {{separate}} points of origin in the Solar System. Short-period comets (those with orbits of up to 200years) are generally accepted to have emerged from either the Kuiper belt or <b>the</b> <b>scattered</b> disc, which are two linked flat discs of icy debris beyond Neptune's orbit at 30AU and jointly extending out beyond 100AU from the Sun. Long-period comets, such as comet Hale–Bopp, whose orbits last for thousands of years, {{are thought to}} originate in the Oort cloud. The orbits within the Kuiper belt are relatively stable, and so very few comets are thought to originate there. <b>The</b> <b>scattered</b> disc, however, is dynamically active, and is far more likely to be the place of origin for comets.

5|$|Models by Julio Ángel Fernández {{suggest that}} <b>the</b> <b>scattered</b> disc, {{which is the}} main source for {{periodic}} comets in the Solar System, might also be the primary source for Oort cloud objects. According to the models, {{about half of the}} objects scattered travel outward toward the Oort cloud, whereas a quarter are shifted inward to Jupiter's orbit, and a quarter are ejected on hyperbolic orbits. <b>The</b> <b>scattered</b> disc might still be supplying the Oort cloud with material. A third of <b>the</b> <b>scattered</b> disc's population is likely to end up in the Oort cloud after 2.5billion years.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>scattered</b> disc is a sparsely {{populated}} region, overlapping with the Kuiper belt but extending to beyond 100 AU. Scattered disc objects (SDOs) have very elliptical orbits, often also very inclined to the ecliptic. Most models of Solar System formation show both KBOs and SDOs first forming in a primordial belt, with later gravitational interactions, particularly with Neptune, sending the objects outward, some into stable orbits (the KBOs) and some into unstable orbits, <b>the</b> <b>scattered</b> disc. Due to its unstable nature, <b>the</b> <b>scattered</b> disc is suspected {{to be the}} point of origin {{of many of the}} Solar System's short-period comets. Their dynamic orbits occasionally force them into the inner Solar System, first becoming centaurs, and then short-period comets.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{unstable}} nature, astronomers {{now consider}} <b>the</b> <b>scattered</b> disc {{to be the}} place of origin for most periodic comets in the Solar System, with the centaurs, a population of icy bodies between Jupiter and Neptune, being the intermediate stage in an object's migration from the disc to the inner Solar System. Eventually, perturbations from the giant planets send such objects towards the Sun, transforming them into periodic comets. Many Oort cloud objects are also thought to have originated in <b>the</b> <b>scattered</b> disc. Detached objects are not sharply distinct from scattered disc objects, and some such as Sedna have sometimes been considered {{to be included in}} this group.|$|E

5|$|Comets can loosely {{be divided}} into two categories: short-period and long-period—the latter being thought to {{originate}} in the Oort cloud. The two major categories of short-period comets are Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) and Halley-type comets.

5|$|One {{explanation}} is {{the exposure of}} whiter subsurface layers by impacts; another is that <b>the</b> <b>scattered</b> objects' greater distance from the Sun creates a composition gradient, analogous to the composition gradient of the terrestrial and gas giant planets.
