5|$|Zieliński {{left the}} company, and Kiciński headed the project. Although the game's {{development}} continued, the demo was abandoned. According to CD Projekt, the development team had different {{ideas for the}} game and lacked overall direction; as a result, it was returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board in 2003. The team, unfamiliar with video-game development, spent nearly two years organising production. They received assistance from BioWare, who helped promote the game at the 2004 Electronic Entertainment Expo by offering CD Projekt space in their booth next to Jade Empire. BioWare also licensed their Aurora game engine to the company.|$|E
25|$|These are {{intended}} for measuring spatial ability in children. With this test, an experimenter presents the participant with a drawing of a maze {{with a picture of}} a man in the centre. While the participant watches, the experimenter uses his or her finger to trace a pathway from the opening of the maze <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> of the man. The participant is then expected to replicate the demonstrated pathway through the maze <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> of the man. Mazes vary in complexity as difficulty increases.|$|E

25|$|Taking this success, Najwa {{got back}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board {{for a new}} album. Months were spent piecing {{together}} lyrics and arrangements, and by mid-2003, the album was ready for release. Rotana set up a large launch party in Downtown Beirut, where over fifteen thousand of Karam's fans packed the streets, waiting for Najwa to appear and sing her new material.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} Sri Lankan {{painting}} and sculpture can be traced {{as far back as}} to the 2nd or 3rd century BC. The earliest mention about the art of painting on Mahavamsa, is <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> of a palace on cloth using cinnabar in the 2nd century BC. The chronicles have description of various paintings in relic-chambers of Buddhist stupas, and in monastic residence.|$|E

25|$|After beating Williams twice by {{decision}}, he met Robinson with Robinson's world Welterweight title on the line. He {{lost his}} first title try, when Robinson won {{a decision in}} 15 rounds. Back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board, he beat Rocky Castellani, the then lightweight world champion Beau Jack, and Laurent Dauthuille (the latter of whom fought Gavilan in Montreal, Canada). All of them were beaten by decision in ten. In 1950, he went 10-4-1, beating Billy Graham, Sonny Horne, Robert Villemain, Eugene Hairston, and Tony Janiro among others.|$|E
25|$|The {{designers}} {{then went}} back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board and the aircraft emerged as the larger Type 700 with up to 48 passengers (53 in some configurations), and a cruising speed of 308mph (496km/h). The new prototype G-AMAV first flew from Brooklands on 28 August 1950, {{and served as a}} development aircraft for the type for several years. In late August 1950, BEA placed an order for 20 aircraft; further orders would come in the following year from operators such as Air France, Aer Lingus and Misrair. In 1953, the basic cost given for a Viscount was £235,000.|$|E
25|$|Mir was {{expected}} to face Cain Velasquez on May 25, 2012, at UFC 146. However, on April 20, 2012, Dana White announced that Mir would face Brazilian Junior dos Santos for the UFC Heavyweight Championship, replacing kickboxer Alistair Overeem. On May 11, 2012, UFC Primetime returned to promote the fight between Mir and dos Santos, and concluded on May 25. In their fight, Dos Santos {{was able to use}} superior foot work to strike in and out before Mir could mount any significant offense. Mir lost the fight via TKO in the second round and has since said he will go back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board and continue his career.|$|E

5000|$|A {{total of}} 100 teams {{played in the}} first {{qualifying}} round. Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> participating teams were placed in ten groups with five seeded and five unseeded teams, depending on their UEFA club coefficient.

25|$|However, the War Office {{judged the}} Tett turret {{to be too}} cramped and not {{bulletproof}} against heavy fire, its isolated nature did not allow adequate command and control and the open top was vulnerable to a well-thrown grenade. The most striking feature was {{that the only way}} in and out was through the top – {{there was no way to}} escape without being exposed to enemy fire – it was to be a fight to the death. Burbridge went back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board and came up with a new version that instead of being positioned over a pipe was placed on a concrete slab over an underground chamber of brick or concrete slabs. This allowed access from a tunnel or slit trench to the rear. The company's brochure shows a wooden seat suspended from the turret by a metal frame.|$|E
25|$|The eastward {{drawing room}} is adorned with themes from the Lohengrin legend. The furnituresofa, table, {{armchairs}} and seats in a northward alcoveis comfortable and homelike. Next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> {{room is a}} little artificial grotto that forms the passage to the study. The unusual room, originally equipped with an artificial waterfall and a so-called rainbow machine, is connected to a little conservatory. Depicting the Hörselberg grotto, it relates to Wagner's Tannhäuser, as does the décor of the adjacent study. In the park of Linderhof Palace the king had installed a similar grotto of greater dimensions. Opposite the study follows the dining room, adorned with themes of courtly love. Since the kitchen in Neuschwanstein is situated three stories below the dining room, {{it was impossible to}} install a wishing table (dining table disappearing by means of a mechanism) as at Linderhof Palace and Herrenchiemsee. Instead, the dining room was connected with the kitchen by means of a service lift.|$|E
25|$|After {{analyzing}} {{hundreds of}} designs, and finally {{coming up with}} what {{was believed to be}} the best design, Bostich finally released the nail in 2005 and labeled it the Sheather Plus. Even though the new nail was stronger than most nails, the barbs, which added the much needed strength to the nail's holding power, weakened the strength of the joint by opening the hole too far. This caused the joint to be sloppy and wobbly, so the team went back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board where the final feature was added to the nail. To compensate for the extra width of the nail hole, due to the ring shanks, Sutt decided to add a thicker screw-shank to the portion of the nail directly under the head. This addition thickened the top portion of the nail giving it a tighter joint, as well as enhancing its overall holding power.|$|E

25|$|Munroe {{had then}} made a {{business}} out of making lead pencils. He made the graphite formula for his pencils in secret, with only {{the help of his}} wife. The business was quite successful. By 1814 he had made nearly 175,000 pencils, which sold for about six thousand dollars, a very large amount of money at the time. When the war with England ended there were better pencils available from Europe and his profits were erased by these better imports. Munroe figured it was pointless to try to compete against these superior products so took up his normal trade of cabinet-making. He also made tooth brushes and watchmaker's brushes, also the first made in the United States. During this interim time he went back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board to do further experimenting with his secret lead pencil paste. One thing led to another until he came up with a powdered graphite paste product that would make its mark.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that Surrey may 'drop its opposition' after BAA offered to fund £11 million of transport improvements and a vote to provisionally drop their opposition was passed by the county's cabinet on 28 September 2010. This decision was due to be finalised by the full council in December 2010 but was deferred. The move was the subject of an 'extraordinary outburst' from Philip Hammond, the local MP, who at the time happened to be the Secretary of State for Transport. Hammond criticised the council for 'grabbing a bribe', a payment of £11 million towards mitigating some traffic problems in Egham entirely unconnected to Airtrack and went on to demand a more comprehensive solution, saying 'no solution, no scheme' and urging BAA to 'get back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board'. BAA had made a significant compromise in offering this payment as it had previously been consistent in arguing that traffic problems caused by Airtrack were not its responsibility, using the fact that Network Rail has no legal obligation to open level crossings at all or to consult on changes.|$|E
500|$|This plotline {{described}} above {{was not used}} in the final film, although it was carried out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> and cel stage, and several inspirational sketch pictures of the dungeon scenes were drawn by Ferdinand Hovarth. It is said that Disney [...] "knew that the Queen would have to look scary without being too scary." [...] Some skeletons are briefly featured in the finished film in {{the other parts of}} the dungeon, except in Australia's censored original theatrical release version. Similar motifs and scenes were later used in Sleeping Beauty and Aladdin. Elements of this sub-plot have also made their way into some other Disney's Snow White fiction and visitor attractions.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{starts a}} band after reading {{about how well}} {{one of his friends}} is doing in the music business. He manages to get Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) to join him in writing a song, with Andy singing an anti-war song from the {{perspective}} of a little girl in falsetto. The song is poorly received by the rest of the office, and Andy returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board. Seeing that Andy is dejected, Kevin and Darryl offer to stay and jam with him for a little extra time, and the trio come up with a lively song called [...] "Bullfrog In Love".|$|E
500|$|Pre-production of {{the game}} began in 2007. Electronic Arts {{approached}} Starbreeze Studios to revive the franchise because Electronic Arts {{was impressed with the}} quality of Starbreeze Studios' [...] previous games and believed they could add [...] "style" [...] to the series. The game was returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board after a year of development, and the co-operative multiplayer mode was added to the main game. The development team hoped the game would appeal to both newcomers and players of the original game; they maintained the theme of the original and drastically changed the gameplay. Richard K. Morgan was hired to write the story for the game.|$|E
500|$|The Banqueting Hall is [...] across with an [...] ceiling, and {{occupies}} {{the whole of}} {{the first floor of the}} Hall Block. Burges persuaded Bute and the antiquarian George Clark that the medieval hall would have stood on the first floor. His original plan saw access via one of two equally circuitous routes through the Well Tower or around the entire internal gallery to enter the hall through a passage next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Drawing</b> Room. Neither approach was acceptable to Bute and at a late stage, around 1878/9, the present entrance was created by expanding a window at the head of the internal gallery.|$|E
