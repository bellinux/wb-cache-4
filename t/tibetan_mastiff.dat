25|$|The breed is {{strikingly similar}} to the English Mastiff, with which it shares a common {{ancestor}} known as the Alpine Mastiff. The modern St. Bernard breed is radically different than the original dogs kept at the St. Bernard hospice, most notably by being much larger in size and build. Since the late 1800s, the St. Bernard breed has been ever refined and improved using many different large Molosser breeds, including the Newfoundland, Great Pyrenees, Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, Bernese Mountain Dog, Great Dane, English Mastiff, and possibly the <b>Tibetan</b> <b>Mastiff</b> and Caucasian Ovcharka. Other breeds such as the Rottweiler, Boxer, and English Bulldog {{may have contributed to}} the St. Bernard's bloodline as well. It is suspected that many of these large breeds were used to redevelop each other to combat the threat of their extinction after World War II, which may explain why all of them played a part in the creation of the St. Bernard as seen today.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Toxoplasma gondii is an amphixenosis {{which has}} {{extensive}} hosts. In recent years, {{the prevalence of}} T. gondii in China has been reported, while little is known on the survey of T. gondii infection in northwest China, especially in yaks (Bos grunniens) and <b>Tibetan</b> <b>mastiffs</b> (Canis lupus familiaris). The current study survey the infection of T. gondii in <b>Tibetan</b> <b>mastiffs</b> and yaks in Qinghai Province, China. Methods The indirect hemagglutination test (IHAT) {{was used to examine}} T. gondii antibodies in 1 795 serums, including 192 <b>Tibetan</b> <b>mastiffs</b> and 1603 yaks in Qinghai Province, China. Results In this study, the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection was 8. 52 %. Twenty (10. 42 %) of 192 serums of <b>Tibetan</b> <b>mastiffs</b> and 133 (8. 30 %) of 1603 serums of yaks were seropositive. The seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in <b>Tibetan</b> <b>mastiffs</b> in breeding farm (1. 08 %) was lower than that in the field (19. 19 %), and the difference was statistically significant (P T. gondii in yaks ranged from 5. 45 % to 13. 28 % among the four different areas. The seroprevalence in different age groups were determined with apparent association. Conclusions The results indicated that T. gondii infection was prevalent in <b>Tibetan</b> <b>mastiffs</b> and yaks, which have implications for public health in this region. To our knowledge, this is the first seroprevalence survey of <b>Tibetan</b> <b>mastiffs</b> infected by T. gondii in The People’s Republic of China. </p...|$|R

2500|$|In 2007, a mtDNA {{analysis}} of extinct eastern Beringian wolves showed that two ancient wolves from the Ukraine dated 30,000 YBP and 28,000 YBP and the 33,000 YBP Altai dog {{had the same}} sequence as six Beringian wolves, indicating a common maternal ancestor. In 2013, a DNA study of the Altai dog deposited the sequence in GenBank with a classification of Canis lupus familiaris (dog). [...] "The analyses revealed that the unique haplotype of the Altai dog is {{more closely related to}} modern dogs and prehistoric New World canids than it is to contemporary wolves... This preliminary analysis affirms the conclusion that the Altai specimen is likely an ancient dog with shallow divergence from ancient wolves. These results suggest a more ancient history of the dog outside of the Middle East or East Asia."

2500|$|The {{origin of}} this {{mountain}} dog conjoins {{the history of}} all the Iberian mastiffs, and its evolution {{is linked to the}} transhumance route on the Iberian Peninsula. In ancient times this molossus dog stood in the high regions of Portugal, in particular in Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro Province. The breed is used to improve pastoralism by developing it as a livestock guardian dog, particularly against Iberian wolf attacks, that are always prolific in the area. [...] The breed has evolved over time with improved genetics through selective breeding for the conditions of pastoral farming. [...] It is thought to have roots with the <b>Tibetan</b> <b>Mastiff.</b> It is an offshoot to the Rafeiro do Alentejo, the southern Portuguese cattle dog, which [...] "for many centuries" [...] would follow the cattle herd in their migrations within the country. [...] As those migrations were curtailed, the two breeds diverged. [...] The breed also shares [...] "some similarities with the short-haired Estrela Mountain Dog." ...|$|E

50|$|Like all flock {{guardian}} breeds, {{they are}} intelligent and stubborn to a fault, so obedience training is recommended (although {{it is only}} mildly successful with some individuals) {{since this is a}} strong-willed, powerful breed. Unless they are to be used exclusively as livestock guardians, socialization obedience training is also critical with this breed because of their reserved nature with strangers and guardian instincts. They are excellent family dogs — for the right family. Owners must understand canine psychology and be willing and able to assume the primary leadership position. Lack of consistent, rational discipline can result in the creation of dangerous, unpredictable dogs (although this is true of virtually every dog breed).
