6000|$|THE JUDGE. Didn't it {{occur to}} you that the only <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do was to confess to your employers, and restore the money? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Grizel," [...] he said impulsively, [...] "there's {{just one}} <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do. You have money, and you maun run away afore he comes!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's all right. Take your gripsack and get along. The <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{do is to}} go {{home and}} work the weather, John W. Merlin." ...|$|E
60|$|Before I wind up this discourse, I {{would lay}} down these few <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} of, and meditate upon.|$|R
6000|$|Sibyl ignored this reply. [...] "Please go and {{get your}} supper, and when you've had it come up here again. I've some <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{think so}} now, dear," [...] he said, [...] "but {{remember}} that you are very young. There are many <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> learn before <b>you</b> grow up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Cliff," [...] said she, {{when the}} other had finished, [...] "there is but one <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do: you must go to Europe with us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh it isn't, thank goodness, that she's in {{love with}} you. It's not, as I told you at first, the sort of <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> fear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There now, I {{never meant}} {{you to be}} there. You ought to be gone to bed, child. It is not a <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> know {{anything}} about.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{this is to}} be the arrangement, which Miss Starbrow has sanctioned. There {{are several}} <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> study, and Miss Churton will {{undertake}} them all except one. It will be <b>for</b> me <b>to</b> instruct <b>you</b> in religion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Meantime," [...] said Mary Louise, {{refusing to}} argue the point, [...] "here are some little <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> hide away, and <b>to</b> eat {{whenever}} <b>you</b> please," [...] and she took from the basket the canned goods she had bought and set them in an enticing row upon the table.|$|R

6000|$|... "That's a fine <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> say," [...] {{retorted}} Aunt Jane. [...] "Like as not she'll be fetching that hang-dog Joel Creech up {{here for}} you to support." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye, John," [...] said she, turning round. [...] "You {{know how}} sorry {{we are to}} lose you. But it's a great <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be going up to London." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} an evil <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> kill me," [...] he told the man. [...] "I have done you no wrong, nor have I done the Buli wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> settle that waiter for ever, {{and remove}} the last {{lingering}} doubt from his mind, the <b>thing</b> is <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be rude to me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, thank you," [...] she returned. [...] "I'm {{going out}} with Mary. We're going <b>to</b> buy some <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> boys <b>to</b> take along when <b>you</b> go <b>to</b> that {{boarding}} school." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Billali," [...] I said, [...] "once, thou knowest, I did save thy life. Now {{pay back}} the debt, my father, and save me mine and my friend's, the Lion's. It shall be a {{pleasant}} <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> think of when thine hour comes, and something to set in the scale against the evil doing of thy days, if perchance thou hast done any evil. Also, if thou be right, and if She doth but hide herself, surely when she comes again she shall reward thee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here is one <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> remember--that we {{are always}} to be true friends, from this time forward. If anyone annoys you, come to me, and I will protect you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O Frank," [...] Alice exclaimed, [...] "what a mad <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do. Oh! I am {{so pleased}} you did it--but oh, you do look cold! What will you do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you see, it is {{not very}} long since either of you left school, so I should think the best <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> wear are your school colors, {{whatever}} they were." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It would seem," [...] {{continued}} his father, in a pompous tone, as if still addressing the earth--"it would seem, most mighty planet, {{a very easy}} <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> release this single stone, for a few minutes, from the grasp with which thou holdest all things down upon thy surface. And by it I shall gain much, while thou wilt lose nothing; for, if thou wilt not willingly give up the stone, I must get three or four yoke of strong oxen, and, by main force, pull it away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are a lot}} of <b>things</b> still <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> believe," [...] says Mr. Evesham beaming. [...] "A lot of things! One's {{capacity}} increases. It grows with exercise. Justin {{will bear}} me out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not, indeed?" [...] he reechoed, sardonically. [...] "Then {{the safe}} <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> is <b>to</b> kill {{me on the}} spot. I would defend myself. But you may just as well know I am going about unarmed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, what a crack I got, when I fell over!" [...] he murmured, {{and then}} he added, gratefully: [...] "It was a fine <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> jump in after me, Dave!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{tell you}} it has not arrived!' she said, with some anger. 'I have not got a lover, and {{everybody}} knows I haven't, and it's an insinuating <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> say so!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nonsense!' said Ethelberta severely. 'We are all contriving {{how to live}} most comfortably, and it is by far {{the best}} <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> stay at the school. You used to be happy enough there.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{announcement}} was sociably, even though, after Waymarsh's wont, somewhat solemnly made; but Strether quickly felt {{other things in}} it than these light features. It was the first approach, from that quarter, to admitted consciousness; it quickened his pulse; it simply meant at last {{that he should have}} but himself to thank if he didn't know where he was. He had finished his breakfast; he pushed it away and was on his feet. There were plenty of elements of surprise, but only one of doubt. [...] "The <b>thing's</b> <b>for</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>to</b> keep here too?" [...] Waymarsh had been slightly ambiguous.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{if you are}} {{the gentleman}} I think you. I'm disappointed, but the girl can't help it, and the only <b>thing</b> left <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do is to go away for a time. Where will you go?" ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. PEARCE [coming back] Now, Eliza. The new <b>things</b> {{have come}} <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> try on.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. By the way, {{how did you}} get the situation? And what put it {{into your}} head to be a valet at all? It seems such a curious <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> think of doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} serve under any other chief. The best <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{do is to}} go out when I do. I think by keeping on that uniform {{you can get to}} the train with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{so far as}} I can see, {{the only}} <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do is to miss the ship this trip," [...] said the mate, without looking at him. [...] "I can take her out all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It don't make no {{difference}} what he SAID--that ain't the thing. The <b>thing</b> is <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> treat him KIND, and not be saying things to make him remember he ain't {{in his own country}} and amongst his own folks." ...|$|R
50|$|One segment {{early in}} the film serves to {{introduce}} several of the band's virtuoso musicians (yet those musicians are not credited by name). Another provides the audience {{with a chance to}} see the Rhythm Boys, already famous by sound but not sight because of their recordings and radio broadcasts, performing in a home-like setting. There are novelty and comedy numbers ranging from the mildly risqu√© (Ragamuffin Romeo, which features contortionistic dancing that provides an excuse for intimate views of frilly underwear) to the humorously sadomasochistic (the second chorus of I Like <b>to</b> Do <b>Things</b> <b>for</b> <b>You)</b> <b>to</b> the simply silly (I'm a Fisherman). There is a line of chorus girls, practically mandatory in early musicals, but in their featured spot the novelty is that they are seated.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} days after Hoover called King [...] "the most notorious liar in the country" [...] at a press conference, Sullivan wrote an {{anonymous}} letter to King calling him a [...] "filthy, abnormal animal" [...] and telling him that there [...] "is only one <b>thing</b> left <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do".|$|R
