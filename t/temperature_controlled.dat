5|$|Six {{versions}} of the 8-foot high vault were built, each with specific uses. One of the vaults was a façade built onto {{the front of a}} semitruck and was used for filming close shots of the vault destroying street cars. Another vault was a reinforced, four-wheel self-drive vehicle that was connected to 30-foot cables and dragged through the streets of San Juan by the two stunt Dodge Chargers. The four-ton vault was driven by stunt driver Henry Kingi, who had to wear a <b>temperature</b> <b>controlled</b> suit to compensate for the temperatures within that could exceed 100 degrees. A scene where the vault tumbled as the cars rounded a corner was a practical effect, and the result was more violent than the filmmakers had anticipated. Over 200 vehicles were destroyed by the vault during filming. Several stunts had to be cut including a final scene that would have seen the vault hanging {{over the edge of the}} Teodoro Moscoso Bridge. This stunt was abandoned when it was determined that even the powerful Chargers would not be able to support the vault's weight.|$|E

The formulation for gum base is proprietary information known to few individuals within each gum-producing company. Next, other ingredients such as nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners and flavors {{are added to}} the gum base until the warm mixture thickens like dough. The gum base mixture is heated during this mixing process in order to increase the entropy of the polymers to achieve a more uniform dispersion of ingredients. Then, extrusion technology is implemented to smooth, form, and shape the gum. Next, the gum goes through a shaping process that is determined by gum type and consumer demand. For example, cut and wrap (chunk or cube) pieces are severed straight out of the extruder using a vertical cutter. Sheeting is a technique often used for stick, slab and tab gums.

Because the quartz flexible accelerometer based on springy support technology is the core sensor in the strapdown airborne gravimeter and the magnet steel in the electromagnetic force equilibrium circuits of the quartz flexible accelerometer is greatly affected by temperature, in order to guarantee the <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> precision and minimize the effect of temperature on the gravimeter, the SGA-WZ <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> system adopts a three-level control method. Based on the design experience of the SGA-WZ- 01, the SGA-WZ- 02 <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> system came out with a further optimized design. In 1 st level <b>temperature</b> <b>control,</b> thermoelectric cooler is used to conquer temperature change caused by hot weather. The experiments show that the optimized stability of 1 st level <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> is about 0. 1 ˝C and the max cool down capability is about 10 ˝C.

40|$|Achieving an {{effective}} combination of various <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> measures {{is critical for}} <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> and crack prevention of concrete dams. This paper presents a procedure for optimizing the <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> scheme of roller compacted concrete (RCC) dams that couples the finite element method (FEM) with a sensitivity analysis method. In this study, seven <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> schemes are defined according to variations in three <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> measures: concrete placement temperature, water-pipe cooling time, and thermal insulation layer thickness. FEM is employed to simulate the equivalent temperature field and temperature stress field obtained under {{each of the seven}} designed <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> schemes for a typical overflow dam monolith based on the actual characteristics of a RCC dam located in southwestern China. A sensitivity analysis is subsequently conducted to investigate the degree of influence each of the three <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> measures has on the temperature field and temperature tensile stress field of the dam. Results show that the placement temperature has a substantial influence on the maximum temperature and tensile stress of the dam, and that the placement temperature cannot exceed 15 °C. The water-pipe cooling time and thermal insulation layer thickness have little influence on the maximum temperature, but both demonstrate a substantial influence on the maximum tensile stress of the dam. The thermal insulation thickness is significant for reducing the probability of cracking as a result of high thermal stress, and the maximum tensile stress can be controlled under the specification limit with a thermal insulation layer thickness of 10 cm. Finally, an optimized <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> scheme for crack prevention is obtained based on the analysis results...|$|R
