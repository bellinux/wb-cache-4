The Shogun writes an unequal contract with aliens which allows the aliens to enter the country and places a ban on carrying swords in public.

5|$|The calf nurses {{for three}} years, {{although}} lactation usually lasts longer, allowing for extensive mother-calf bonds. Short-finned pilot whale females will go though menopause, {{but this is}} not as common in females of long-finned pilot whales. Postreproductive females possibly play important roles in the survival of the young. Postreproductive females will continue to lactate and nurse young. Since <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> bear young of their own, these females invest in the current young. Short-finned pilot whales grow more slowly than long-finned pilot whales. For the short-finned pilot whale, females become sexually mature at 9 years old and males at about 13–16 years. For the long-finned pilot whale, females reach maturity at around eight years and males at around 12 years.|$|E
5|$|When {{a warrior}} is so old, or sustains an injury that means <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> serve their Clan, they retire to become elders. Elders live out the {{remainder}} of their life in general peace, {{using it as a}} time of rest and relaxation. They sleep in their own separate den, which is looked after by the apprentices. Elders are not expected to hunt or fight for their Clan, but are able to do so if the mood takes them. Their only expected duty is to carry the body of a deceased Clanmate to their grave. Every cat of the Clan respects and appreciates the elders, thanking them for the time they have spent upholding their roles as a warrior. Sadly, it is rare for a Clan to have more than three or four elders, as many warriors die before they can retire.|$|E

In EastEnders: E20, he helps his friend Mercy Olubunmi (Bunmi Mojekwu) with a project to encourage more young people to the church, but his ideas leave them both humiliated. They meet Leon Small (Sam Attwater) and ZsaZsa Carter (Emer Kenny) and start squatting in a flat. Fatboy tells ZsaZsa and Leon both his parents {{were killed in a}} drive-by shooting. He finds out Mercy is pregnant and accuses Leon of being the father. During an argument, Mercy reveals that Fatboy's parents are alive, angering ZsaZsa, who throws Fatboy's laptop out of the window. On their last night in the flat, he arranges a party but leaves before the police arrive.

Discovering this plot, Orlok is outraged at the proposed deception, believing that Dredd should be convicted or released, without regard for the Diktatorat's public image. Orlok is further disillusioned with his masters when they confess that the ten billion credit reward on Dredd's head was secretly funded by Nero Narcos, to eliminate Dredd before Operation Doomsday began. Tired of Orlok's protests, the Diktatorat dismiss him from their service, whereupon Orlok assassinates most of them and rescues Dredd from his cell.|$|E
25|$|VEP {{testing of}} acuity is {{somewhat}} similar to preferential looking in using {{a series of}} black and white stripes (sine wave gratings) or checkerboard patterns (which produce larger responses than stripes). Behavioral responses are not required and brain waves created by the presentation of the patterns are recorded instead. The patterns become finer and finer until the evoked brain wave just disappears, which is considered to be the endpoint measure of visual acuity. In adults and older, verbal children capable of paying attention and following instructions, the endpoint provided by the VEP corresponds very well to the psychophysical measure in the standard measurement (i.e. the perceptual endpoint determined by asking the subject when <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> see the pattern). There is an assumption that this correspondence also applies to much younger children and infants, though this does not necessarily have to be the case. Studies do show the evoked brain waves, as well as derived acuities, are very adult-like by one year of age.|$|E

25|$|The dam poses an impassable {{barrier to}} {{migrating}} salmonids which {{is significant because}} the San Francisquito Creek watershed hosts the most viable remaining native steelhead trout (coastal rainbow trout) (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus) population in the South San Francisco Bay.

25|$|Since 1979, it {{has been}} {{prohibited}} for federal funds to cover abortion costs for Peace Corps volunteers. Even in instances of life endangerment, rape and incest, volunteers are not financially covered. 433 Peace Corps volunteers were interviewed and {{it was reported that}} many thought the funding ban on abortion coverage should be removed. This was a two-month interview with no eligibility restrictions. Abortion is such a controversial topic that this just made it much more difficult for the Peace Corps to handle. Volunteers do receive health care, including prescription medications, routine examinations, and emergency care, free of charge. These services are provided in-country through a Peace Corps Medical Officer. Peace Corps volunteers don't make much money, which adds to this issue in the news. The abortion topic is very active in the Peace Corps, because when volunteers become pregnant for any reason, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be volunteers, and a significant number of them want to remain volunteers.

25|$|For Congolese, mining is {{the easiest}} source of income, because the work is consistent, albeit for only 1 dollar per day. It is laborious, as miners walk for days in the forest to the ore, scratch it with hand tools and pan it. About 90% of young men in Congo do this. Research {{revealed}} that many Congolese leave farming because they need money quickly and cannot wait for crops to grow. Farming also presents obstacles. For example, a lack of roads makes it extremely difficult to transport produce to markets, and the harvest can be taken by militias or the Congolese army. Once their food is taken away or <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> grow food, people resort to mining to sustain themselves. Organized mines are usually run by corrupt groups like militias. Congolese have few tools to mine coltan, and no safety procedures or experience in mining.

Miners consider coltan mining a way to provide for themselves {{in the face of}} widespread war and conflict and a government that has no concern for their welfare.|$|E

50|$|Apoptosis is an {{important}} mechanism in regulating K562 cells and can be induced by {{the changes in the}} metabolic state of the cells. There are many different cellular components involved in the cycle of apoptosis such as, BCR/ABL, Bcl-2, Bax protein, and cytochrome C. The tumor suppressor gene p53 is also important in the cell cycle regulation of K562 cells. This gene targets the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21, and causes cell differentiation, cell cycle arrest in G1, and ultimately apoptosis. When the levels of these components are thrown off, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> either <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> inhibit apoptosis of the cancer cells, a role fulfilled by BCR/ABL, or they cause apoptosis to be induced, in the same vein as Bax and cytochrome C. These components are key in the mitochondria, and due to this, it has been supported that apoptosis uses the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. The offset of these cellular components from their balance point causes morphological changes, which result in the K562 cells being arrested in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. This arrest leads to “shrinkage, blebbing, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensing” and other morphological changes that cause the cell to program death at this point.|$|R
