5000|$|... 1995 {{model year}} engines had three {{features}} that set {{them apart from}} later engines. The positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system utilized a plastic oil separator box that was vented directly to the block itself; the breather hose and PCV valve hoses attached to the box, and connected to the induction system. Later engines featured a PCV system that was molded to the cylinder head valve cover. The second feature was internal in nature - the crankshaft main bearings were keyed into the bedplate on the right rear of each <b>transverse</b> <b>web.</b> Later model years featured keys machined on the right front of each web. These considerations are important when considering a rebuild or replacement of this engine. The third feature would be a slightly bigger camshaft that was changed on 1996 and up SOHC vehicles due to a rough idle when the air conditioning was on. This 1995 model year cam is now being sold by dealers as a power upgrade for 1996 and up SOHC engines, {{but it can also}} easily be found at salvage yards for a low price.|$|E
40|$|Composite bridges in Sweden are {{commonly}} {{designed as a}} twin I-girder section. To stablizie the bridge during launching and concreting horizontal cross bracings are used. These are normally connected to a <b>transverse</b> <b>web</b> stiffener that is welded with a throat size of 5 mm regardless of {{the dimensions of the}} bridge. During an inspection of VÃ¥rby Bridge south of Stockholm in 2006 cracks were found in this weld between the <b>transverse</b> <b>web</b> stiffener and the top flange. After discovering of these problems the Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) wants the designer to present calculations for this weld. The aim of this thesis was to investigate and compare the stresses in the weld between the top flange and the transverse stiffener for different cross bracings. A finite element model of a typical composite bridge, with five different types of cross bracings, was investigated using the FE program Brigade Plus. A selection of loads including temperature-, traffic- and fatigue loads were considered. The thesis clearly shows that the design of cross bracings will affect the stress levels in the weld. ...|$|E

40|$|Deterioration in {{reinforced}} concrete structures {{is a major}} issue faced by the infrastructures and bridge industries all over the world. Since complete replacement of these structures requires high investment, strengthening has become the suitable solution to modify and improve {{the performance of the}} structures. Previously steel plates were used as external reinforcement to strengthen deficient RC structures, but in the last fifteen years or so on, FRP composites have been used to replace steel because of their superior properties. RC T-section is the most common shape of beams and girders in buildings and bridges. Shear failure of RC T-beams is identified as the most disastrous failure mode as it does not give any advance warning before failure. The shear strengthening of RC T-beams using externally bonded (EB) FRP composites has become a popular structural strengthening technique, due to the well-known advantages of FRP composites such as their high strength-to-weight ratio and excellent corrosion resistance. This study explores the result of an experimental investigation for enhancing the shear capacity of {{reinforced concrete}} (RC) T-beams with shear deficiencies, strengthened with Basalt Fiber Reinforced Polymer (BFRP) sheets which are a relatively new and economic alternative to more expensive fibers commonly used in strengthening of RC beams. A total of 22 numbers of concrete T-beams are tested and various sheet configurations and layouts are studied to determine their effects on the shear capacity of the beams. One beam of the beams is considered as control beam, while other beams are strengthened with externally bonded BFRP sheets/strips. To accommodate essential services like electricity cables, natural gas pipes, water and drainage pipes, air-conditioning, telephone lines, and computer network <b>transverse</b> <b>web</b> opening are necessary in modern building construction. Hence, the present study investigates the shear behaviour of RC T-beams with different types of <b>transverse</b> <b>web</b> openings. The various parameters investigated in this study included BFRP amount and distribution, bonded surface, number of layers of BFRP, fiber orientation, <b>transverse</b> <b>web</b> openings of different shape (i. e., circular versus square versus rectangular) and end anchor. The experimental results demonstrated that the use of the new mechanical anchorage scheme comprising of laminated composite plates increases the shear capacity of the beams significantly by preventing the debonding of BFRP sheets, so that the full strength of the BFRP sheets get utilized. An analytical study is also carried out to validate the experimental findings...|$|E
40|$|Aluminium is a {{material}} commonly used for smaller boats and high speed crafts {{due to its}} low weight. Traditionally the hull construction is performed {{in a similar manner}} as that of steel ships, with longitudinal stiffeners fitted through cut-outs in the <b>transverse</b> <b>web</b> frames and welded to the shell plating. This requires much fitting and welding, making the production of hulls a slow and expensive task due to the manual labour needed. An alternative method for construction of aluminium hulls is to extrude panels consisting of both the shell plating and stiffener. These pre-fabricated panels are then welded directly to the transverse frames, thus reducing the manual labour related to hull production significantly. This thesis continues the work previously performed by Jon Englund on floating panels. He found that the stresses will increase significantly in a floating frame structure compared to that of a traditional, fixed structure. It was discovered that the main challenge of a floating frame structure is out-of-plane bending stresses occurring in the stiffeners webs due to frame deflections. By use of finite element analyses and analytical calculations, a compartment of the JumboCat 60 is analysed, and proposals for achieving acceptable stresses are given. The stiffener stresses mentioned above are found to be drastically reduced by increasing the bending- and axial stiffness of the <b>transverse</b> <b>web</b> frames. Local stress concentrations are found in the intersection between stiffener and web frame. Nonlinear finite element analyses show that substantial strain-hardening can be achieved in the stiffeners webs through cyclic loading. The loss of strength due to welding may thus be partly recovered. </p...|$|E

40|$|Fatigue {{prediction}} of ships {{is always a}} challenge. For container ships, that which, by default, are sensitive to fatigue because of their large deck openings and because of their operating in the extreme conditions of the North Atlantic, this prediction is even harder to make. Further studies are trying {{to establish a new}} method that can predict possible material failure in a more effective way. This study aims at performing stochastic fatigue analyses using a finite element model of a 4, 400 TEU container ship according to the procedure of DNV software SESAM. These analyses could become a basis for the comparison of results between the standard method of fatigue prediction and a new simplified method. The analysis contains frequency domain hydrodynamic simulation, linear elastic structural analysis and stochastic fatigue analysis. The finite element (FE) model of the entire ship indicated several regions where severe fatigue damage is expected. One of these areas was chosen to be represented by a more detailed FE model. The bilge in the midship region was considered most critical because being under the waterline level, cracks are not easily noticed. This local submodel indicated that the highest fatigue damage is located at the connection of <b>transverse</b> <b>web</b> frames with the double side. A detailed FE model represents the double side with a <b>transverse</b> <b>web</b> frame and cut-outs for longitudinal stiffeners. From this analysis, the largest damage is expected at the cut-outs. The hotspot method, according to DNV recommendations, was used to obtain stress concentration factors at two points, which are then applied to the fatigue analysis of the global FE model of the entire ship. The stochastic fatigue analysis of the detailed FE model gives unrealistically high fatigue damage for some local areas. The assumptions and limitations {{of this study suggest that}} the resulting fatigue damage will be overestimated, although they cannot explain this extent of overestimation.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop mathematical tools for the reliability assessment of ship hulls subjected to the degrading effect of corrosion and of fatigue on the longitudinal members. The effect of corrosion {{is presented as a}} time dependent process with two states. In the first one, there is no corrosion due to existence of coating protection. Upon failure of the protection system general corrosion decreases plate thickness and affects the midship section modulus. The potential cracks are considered to occur in the connections between longitudinal stiffeners and <b>transverse</b> <b>web</b> frames. The model accounts for the crack growth process applying linear elastic fracture mechanics. It is considered that a ship hull girder is subjected to the simultaneous action of corrosion and of fatigue in longitudinal members. The effect of both phenomena on the section modulus is accounted for and it is used as the reference variable to measure the reliability of the ship hull against collapse. The effect of maintenance actions is modelled as a stochastic process and it is accounted for considering that the repaired elements are restored to a state as new. Different repair policies are studied and the approach {{can be used as a}} tool to plan the maintenance action based on reliability resultsAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

This type of syringomyelia is often termed idiopathic. Current literature has less than 10 reports of arachnoid webs to be the causative factor. We present our experience in the management of two cases of syringomyelia secondary to arachnoid webs. Both our patients presented with progressive neurological deterioration with MRI scans demonstrating cervical/thoracic syrinx without Chiari malformation or low-lying cord.

The study is motivated by the need for simple guidelines {{that can be used in}} practical design of girders in building and offshore structures. Simplicity of method is highly desireable because the value of any calculation decreases sharply if it is not completed before the design is frozen. The study comprises a review of existing load-carrying theories, including methods based on allowable stresses, strength criteria, simplified shear buckling, rotated stress fields,tension and stressed skin. 260 simulations of girders are performed by means of the non. linear finite element program ABAQUS. Results from experiments of large plate girders are used to calibrate the finite element models, in order to ensure that reliable models are used in the simulations. The simulations comprise girders with webs of height-thickness ratios from 63 to 333. The openings are circular, elongated circular, square and rectangular, with and without sleeves, doubler plates, vertical stiffeners and horizontal reinforcement. Opening sizes are 25 % and 50 % of girder heights. SIngle openings and two openings close together are included. The shear capacites and <b>transverse</b> <b>web</b> displacements in the various limit states are discussed. A new design procedure is proposed for girders with openings. Here, the calculation of the shear capacity in the ultimate limit state (ULS) is linked to the Eurocode 3 for girders without openings.

40|$|Failure of {{ballast tank}} {{coatings}} {{is an increasing}} problem in todayâs shipping industry. The consequences of coating failures (fracture) are corrosion of the steel {{which can lead to}} early occurrence of fatigue cracks and fast fatigue crack propagation. Inspections of coatings in water ballast tanks of ships have shown that fracture of many coatings occurs earlier than their design life (which is around 8 - 12 years), although the coatings have been maintained regularly and properly. From a financial perspective, maintenance and repair of a coating is very expensive (810 million USD for the US marine shipping industry in 2006) and should be reduced. This can be achieved by better methods that can assist in the identification of critical locations in water ballast tanks regarding coating failure. With such a method, the preparation for maintenance and repair procedures can be made more efficiently. The aim of this thesis is to suggest a method (simulation procedure) which can be used to identify local areas inside a ballast tank where coating fracture may occur as a result of large strains and ageing of the coatingâs mechanical properties. The methodology proposed is to use a finite element sub-modelling technique that involves full ship analysis to find local areas which thereafter are refined to better represent ballast tank areas and locations with high strain levels. These areas are then modelled into more detailed local models in order to perform non-linear finite element analyses where the ship steel is allowed to exceed its yield stress in e. g. cut-outs. Fracture of a coating is assumed to occur when the strain level of the ship steel exceeds the fracture strain of the aged coating. Different sea state conditions are simulated where the significant wave height, the wave heading angle and the shipâs speed are varied. Six different local areas are studied in detail with regard to the strain response of the steel (substrate). The computed strains in the substrate are compared against fracture strains of un-aged and aged water ballast tank coating samples from uniaxial tensile tests. The results show that the strain in the substrate exceeds the fracture strain of aged coatings in several locations, i. e. the coating will fracture. The most critical areas and locations of the case study vessel are {{at the bottom of the}} ballast tank, in the cut-outs that intersect a longitudinal stiffener and a <b>transverse</b> <b>web</b> frame. It is concluded that the method proposed is suitable for finding local areas where the strain of the substrate exceeds the fracture strain of the coating. It is also concluded that high mesh density in local details is necessary in this method in order to carry out realistic simulations and resolve the strain gradients in cut-out details and thereby be able to compare strains in the substrate with coating fracture strains...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The performance of thin-plate structural systems {{is known to be}} greatly influenced by the effect of buckling and post-buckling behaviour. The main factors, which affect the buckling, and post-bucking characteristics and consequently the ultimate performance of thin plate structural components, are noted to be structural geometry, material properties, loading and boundary conditions and geometric imperfections. Present day knowledge and understanding of the buckling and post-buckling behaviour of thin plate structures is at a fairly sophisticated level due to the intensive research that has been carried out over the years in this field of study. This is particularly true for the case of compressive loading whereby the collapse and unloading failure mechanics of thin plate structures has been well documented for this case. The same is not true for the case of shear loading and although much work has been carried out {{there is a lack of}} knowledge and in-depth understanding of shear post-ultimate conditions which essentially defines the initiation and progressive development of the plastic failure mechanisms of thin plate structural system. This thesis makes a contribution to the area of study by taking advantage of the developments in recent years of computational technology and computing power to develop finite element modelling strategies and solution procedures using the commercially available FE package PATRAN/NASTRAN to describe in detail the post-buckled shear failure of thin plate structural systems. The work of this thesis provides an in-depth understanding of the complex post-buckled failure mechanics associated with thin-plate structures subjected to in-plane shear displacement and combined shear and compression loading. Simply supported in-plane normal stress free and straight edge boundaries are employed to examine the shear performance as well as the failure mechanisms of thin and stocky web plates. Finite element modelling strategies are developed, which are able to describe the complete loading history from the onset of initial buckling through the nonlinear elastic post-buckling to initial material yielding and its further propagation throughout the structure leading to the development of an appropriate failure mechanism that causes final plastic collapse and subsequent load drop-off. The post-buckled failure response of the thin plate structures is determined with due consideration being given to the effects of geometric and material nonlinearities. The effect of stiffeners on structural performance is detailed for single and multiple asymmetrical and symmetrically attached stiffeners. The degrading influence on the structural performance of cut-outs as well as the considerable redeeming effect due to reinforcements attached at the cut-out boundaries is highlighted in this thesis. The work of the thesis covers the in-plane shear displacement loading of thin web plates, thin <b>web</b> plates with <b>transverse</b> stiffeners, <b>web</b> plates with cut-outs, web plates with stiffened cut-outs and the interactive shear and compressive loading of transversely stiffened web structures. The in-plane shear displacement loading of these structures using the multipoint constraint loading strategy in the finite element modelling procedures has shown to be highly successful in being able to provide an in-depth understanding of the failure mechanics of these structures to a level not to be found in the existing literature...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation was}} made to study the shear transfer between precast prestressed beams and in-situ concrete in a relatively new method of construction of continuous bridge decks where the ends of precast beams are connected to an integral in-situ crosshead away from the supports. Two series of tests were carried out. In the first series 1 / 3 scale models of the M. o. T, C&CA M- 8 sections were used, and these were modified in the second series to study {{the effect of the}} beam's top flanges within the connection. One of the most important mechanisms of shear transfer proved to be the top flanges of the precast beam. For the precast beams with top flanges (first series), and with a 300 mm beam embedment length, it was discovered that: a) The shear force is transferred from a small length {{at the end of the}} beam. b) The in-situ concrete nibs (concrete surrounding the web) can take this shear force without stirrups. c) There is no need either to project all the bars from the precast into the in-situ concrete or to prestress the connection transversely as a means of improving shear transfer. d) It was possible to transfer the whole shear force at the connection with a reduced embedment length of 100 mm with nib stirrups. For the precast beam without top flanges, the transfer of the shear force at the connection required other improving details. In this respect <b>transverse</b> prestressing and <b>web</b> shear connectors were utilized effectively. The effect of projecting bars was also examined. In the general behaviour of composite continuous beams subjected to shear a detailed comparison was made between different Code predictions for the web cracking shear and web crushing strength. A mathematical model is also proposed to predict the stirrup stress according to shear span, effective depth and stirrup ratio when failure is controlled by web crushing. Stirrup stress measurement in the vicinity of continuous support made it possible to predict the enhanced shear strength and a design method is proposed for the continuous beams. A comparion is also made between different Code predictions in this respect. To obtain more information about the strength of web shear connectors used in the secod series, a separate dowel shear specimen was designed. Different interface conditions including bond, dowel bar size and strength and the effect of shrinkage were examined. A design method is proposed together with a comparison with different Code predictions...|$|R
40|$|The LiteSteel Beam (LSB) {{is a new}} hollow flange {{channel section}} {{developed}} by OneSteel Australian Tube Mills using a patented Dual Electric Resistance Welding technique. The LSB has a unique geometry consisting of torsionally rigid rectangular hollow flanges and a relatively slender web. It is commonly used as rafters, floor joists and bearers and roof beams in residential, industrial and commercial buildings. It is on average 40 % lighter than traditional hot-rolled steel beams of equivalent performance. The LSB flexural members are subjected to a relatively new Lateral Distortional Buckling mode, which reduces the member moment capacity. Unlike the commonly observed lateral torsional buckling of steel beams, lateral distortional buckling of LSBs is characterised by simultaneous lateral deflection, twist and web distortion. Current member moment capacity design rules for lateral distortional buckling in AS/NZS 4600 (SA, 2005) {{do not include the}} effect of section geometry of hollow flange beams although its effect is considered to be important. Therefore detailed experimental and finite element analyses (FEA) were carried out to investigate the lateral distortional buckling behaviour of LSBs including the effect of section geometry. The results showed that the current design rules in AS/NZS 4600 (SA, 2005) are over-conservative in the inelastic lateral buckling region. New improved design rules were therefore developed for LSBs based on both FEA and experimental results. A geometrical parameter (K) defined as the ratio of the flange torsional rigidity to the major axis flexural rigidity of the web (GJf/EIxweb) was identified as the critical parameter affecting the lateral distortional buckling of hollow flange beams. The effect of section geometry was then included in the new design rules using the new parameter (K). The new design rule developed by including this parameter was found to be accurate in calculating the member moment capacities of not only LSBs, but also other types of hollow flange steel beams such as Hollow Flange Beams (HFBs), Monosymmetric Hollow Flange Beams (MHFBs) and Rectangular Hollow Flange Beams (RHFBs). The inelastic reserve bending capacity of LSBs has not been investigated yet although the section moment capacity tests of LSBs in the past revealed that inelastic reserve bending capacity is present in LSBs. However, the Australian and American cold-formed steel design codes limit them to the first yield moment. Therefore both experimental and FEA were carried out to investigate the section moment capacity behaviour of LSBs. A comparison of the section moment capacity results from FEA, experiments and current cold-formed steel design codes showed that compact and non-compact LSB sections classified based on AS 4100 (SA, 1998) have some inelastic reserve capacity while slender LSBs do not have any inelastic reserve capacity beyond their first yield moment. It was found that Shifferaw and Schaferâs (2008) proposed equations and Eurocode 3 Part 1. 3 (ECS, 2006) design equations can be used to include the inelastic bending capacities of compact and non-compact LSBs in design. As a simple design approach, the section moment capacity of compact LSB sections can be taken as 1. 10 times their first yield moment while it is the first yield moment for non-compact sections. For slender LSB sections, current cold-formed steel codes can be used to predict their section moment capacities. It was believed that the use of <b>transverse</b> <b>web</b> stiffeners could improve the lateral distortional buckling moment capacities of LSBs. However, currently there are no design equations to predict the elastic lateral distortional buckling and member moment capacities of LSBs with web stiffeners under uniform moment conditions. Therefore, a detailed study was conducted using FEA to simulate both experimental and ideal conditions of LSB flexural members. It was shown that the use of 3 to 5 mm steel plate stiffeners welded or screwed to the inner faces of the top and bottom flanges of LSBs at third span points and supports provided an optimum web stiffener arrangement. Suitable design rules were developed to calculate the improved elastic buckling and ultimate moment capacities of LSBs with these optimum web stiffeners. A design rule using the geometrical parameter K was also developed to improve the accuracy of ultimate moment capacity predictions. This thesis presents the details and results of the experimental and numerical studies of the section and member moment capacities of LSBs conducted in this research. It includes the recommendations made regarding the accuracy of current design rules as well as the new design rules for lateral distortional buckling. The new design rules include the effects of section geometry of hollow flange steel beams. This thesis also developed a method of using web stiffeners to reduce the lateral distortional buckling effects, and associated design rules to calculate the improved moment capacities...|$|E
40|$|LiteSteel Beam (LSB) {{is a new}} cold-formed {{steel beam}} {{produced}} by OneSteel Australian Tube Mills. The new beam is effectively a channel section with two rectangular hollow flanges and a slender web, and is manufactured using a combined cold-forming and electric resistance welding process. OneSteel Australian Tube Mills is promoting the use of LSBs as flexural members {{in a range of}} applications, such as floor bearers. When LSBs are used as back to back built-up sections, they are likely to improve their moment capacity and thus extend their applications further. However, the structural behaviour of built-up beams is not well understood. Many steel design codes include guidelines for connecting two channels to form a built-up I-section including the required longitudinal spacing of connections. But these rules were found to be inadequate in some applications. Currently the safe spans of builtup beams are determined based on twice the moment capacity of a single section. Research has shown that these guidelines are conservative. Therefore large scale lateral buckling tests and advanced numerical analyses were undertaken to investigate the flexural behaviour of back to back LSBs connected by fasteners (bolts) at various longitudinal spacings under uniform moment conditions. In this research an experimental investigation was first undertaken to study the flexural behaviour of back to back LSBs including its buckling characteristics. This experimental study included tensile coupon tests, initial geometric imperfection measurements and lateral buckling tests. The initial geometric imperfection measurements taken on several back to back LSB specimens showed that the back to back bolting process is not likely to alter the imperfections, and the measured imperfections are well below the fabrication tolerance limits. Twelve large scale lateral buckling tests were conducted to investigate the behaviour of back to back built-up LSBs with various longitudinal fastener spacings under uniform moment conditions. Tests also included two single LSB specimens. Test results showed that the back to back LSBs gave higher moment capacities in comparison with single LSBs, and the fastener spacing influenced the ultimate moment capacities. As the fastener spacing was reduced the ultimate moment capacities of back to back LSBs increased. Finite element models of back to back LSBs with varying fastener spacings were then developed to conduct a detailed parametric study on the flexural behaviour of back to back built-up LSBs. Two finite element models were developed, namely experimental and ideal finite element models. The models included the complex contact behaviour between LSB web elements and intermittently fastened bolted connections along the web elements. They were validated by comparing their results with experimental results and numerical results obtained from an established buckling analysis program called THIN-WALL. These comparisons showed that the developed models could accurately predict both the elastic lateral distortional buckling moments and the non-linear ultimate moment capacities of back to back LSBs. Therefore the ideal finite element models incorporating ideal simply supported boundary conditions and uniform moment conditions were used in a detailed parametric study on the flexural behaviour of back to back LSB members. In the detailed parametric study, both elastic buckling and nonlinear analyses of back to back LSBs were conducted for 13 LSB sections with varying spans and fastener spacings. Finite element analysis results confirmed that the current design rules in AS/NZS 4600 (SA, 2005) are very conservative while the new design rules developed by Anapayan and Mahendran (2009 a) for single LSB members were also found to be conservative. Thus new member capacity design rules were developed for back to back LSB members as a function of non-dimensional member slenderness. New empirical equations were also developed to aid in the calculation of elastic lateral distortional buckling moments of intermittently fastened back to back LSBs. Design guidelines were developed for the maximum fastener spacing of back to back LSBs in order to optimise the use of fasteners. A closer fastener spacing of span/ 6 was recommended for intermediate spans and some long spans where the influence of fastener spacing was found to be high. In the last phase of this research, a detailed investigation was conducted to investigate the potential use of different types of connections and stiffeners in improving the flexural strength of back to back LSB members. It was found that using <b>transverse</b> <b>web</b> stiffeners was the most cost-effective and simple strengthening method. It is recommended that web stiffeners are used at the supports and every third points within the span, and their thickness is in the range of 3 to 5 mm {{depending on the size of}} LSB section. The use of web stiffeners eliminated most of the lateral distortional buckling effects and hence improved the ultimate moment capacities. A suitable design equation was developed to calculate the elastic lateral buckling moments of back to back LSBs with the above recommended web stiffener configuration while the same design rules developed for unstiffened back to back LSBs were recommended to calculate the ultimate moment capacities...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{substantial}} increase in oil and gas activities in Polar areas the demand for ice strengthen vessel has increased greatly. This increase in demand has highlighted the importance of designing ice strengthened ship structures that are more producible and maintain adequate safety and integrity. In order to encounter these new challenges, the international association of classification societies (IACS) has developed unified regulations for the designing of ice strengthened ship. In addition to these requirements, most of the classification societies have their regulation for design of polar ships. Stiffened plates are the basic structural building blocks of ships. So, the study mainly explores the plastic response of stiffened plate subject to lateral ice loads. The Non Linear Finite Element Method (NLFEM) is extensively used to study the plastic behavior of stiffened plates. The Abaqus non linear finite element program is used in this study. The aims of the study are to investigate {{the validity of the}} limit state equation employed in the IACS new Unified Requirements for Polar Ships [6], investigate the membrane effect at large deformation, determine the ALS design load, and assess limit loads when fracture in plating likely to take place. The study also focuses on the warping effect of unsymmetrical sections and the effect of end brackets on the lateral load carrying capacity of the stiffener. The effect of mid-span tripping bracket on the load deflection behavior of L and T stiffeners is also studied. In particular, the study focuses on the behavior of inclined T and L stiffener. As ships move forward by crushing ice, sides of ships bow come across with ice initially. To design ice strengthen vessel, it s very important to understand the behavior of ships side structure subjected to ice loads. So, this study extensively focuses on the non-linear finite element analysis of ships side structure subjected to ice loads. Normally, ship design rules are based on the behavior of single frame subjected to loads. It s reasonable to consider frames singly under the uniform loading but in case of ice loading which is non uniform, the behavior of the structure obtained from single frame based design does not accurately represent the true behavior of the structure. The load-deflection characteristic of frames in isolation, frames as part of a Â½+ 1 +Â½ frames and frames as part of a grillage subjected to unsymmetrical loading is studied. As, stiffeners in the side structure of ships bow are not normally perpendicular with shell plate, the lateral capacity of frames as part of a Â½+ 1 +Â½ frames and as part of a grillage is obtained for inclined stiffener. The analyses in this study cover the full range of stiffener behavior from elastic, through yield, through the formation of initial mechanisms, through large deformations. The parameters considered for the analyses are: 	frame profile: Angle, Tee 	frame span 	load length: patch (<b>transverse),</b> uniform (longitudinal) 	<b>web</b> thickness 	end brackets: with, without 	Angle of inclination of stiffener web with the plate flange 	Tripping bracket at mid spa...|$|R
40|$|Based on a {{substantial}} amount of research on the seismic performance of reinforced concrete structural walls (shear walls), modern design provisions for mid-rise and high-rise shear wall buildings have been developed with the goal of achieving significant ductility in the event of strong earthquake ground shaking. Observations following recent earthquakes in Chile (2010) and New Zealand (2011) have demonstrated that shear wall buildings designed according to modern seismic design codes for tension-controlled action may be vulnerable to brittle compression failure. For walls designed to yield in compression, current reinforced concrete design standards in the United States (ACI 318 - 14) assume that ductility is ensured if code-prescribed confinement provisions are satisfied at wall boundaries; however, recent laboratory tests suggest that thin, code-compliant walls may be susceptible to compression failure prior to achieving the inelastic deformation capacity assumed by current U. S. design codes (i. e., ASCE 7 - 10, ASCE 41 - 13). Seven, approximately one-half scale, ACI 318 - 14 compliant wall specimens (designated WP 1 -WP 7) were subjected to reversed cyclic lateral loads and constant axial load. The specimens represented approximately the bottom 1. 5 stories of an eight story cantilever wall. The first phase of testing (WP 1 -WP 4) was conducted to identify potential deficiencies in current provisions. Test variables for the phase 1 specimens included the configuration of boundary longitudinal reinforcement, quantity and arrangement of boundary transverse reinforcement, and compression depth (influence by axial load, quantity of longitudinal reinforcement, and wall cross-section). For the second phase of testing (WP 5 -WP 7), walls were designed either with thicker cross-sections, improved boundary transverse reinforcement details (i. e., continuous transverse reinforcement detail rather than hoop and cross-tie detail), or both. Phase 2 specimens were constructed with improved web details whereby longitudinal reinforcement was placed inside of transverse reinforcement and, in some cases, cross-ties were used to provide lateral restraint to longitudinal reinforcement. Abrupt compression failures occurred at plastic rotations as low as 1. 1 % for the thinnest walls. Plastic rotations greater than 2. 5 % were observed for walls that were 25 % and 50 % thicker and/or constructed with more stringent confinement detailing than required by ACI 318 - 14. Based on experimental results, it is suggested to improve the deformation capacity of thin walls by avoiding the use of cross-tie confinement, and using overlapping hoops or continuous transverse reinforcement instead. Within the web region of walls, it is recommended to provide <b>transverse</b> reinforcement for <b>web</b> longitudinal reinforcement within the plastic hinge region. A lateral drift capacity prediction equation was developed in a displacement-based design format and was shown to agree with experimentally measured drift capacities for a small database of slender wall laboratory tests. It was demonstrated that, in addition to provided boundary transverse reinforcement, drift capacity of slender walls is most impacted by compression depth (c), wall thickness (b), and wall length (lw). Based on experimental data, drift capacities greater than 2 % may be expected for code compliant walls designed such that c/b 5. 0...|$|R
