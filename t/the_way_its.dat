500|$|The Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry Building was a {{chemistry}} laboratory and classroom {{building on the}} campus of Vassar College in the town of Poughkeepsie, New York. The [...] postmodern building stood on the north end of a cluster of other science buildings {{on the site of the}} school's first chemistry laboratory. It was completed in 1984 at a cost of $7.2 million after the college received money from a fund bequeathed to it in the will of California cardiologist and professor Seeley G. Mudd. The structure replaced Sanders Hall of Chemistry and included elements designed to be energy efficient, notably a large wall of glass blocks that designers hoped would passively heat the building. Reviews of the structure were positive when it opened with critics praising <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>its</b> form complemented nearby older buildings. By 2015, many aspects of the building had been evaluated as being in Fair or Poor condition and the building was demolished in April 2016 as part of the Science Center project, later replaced with an open green space.|$|E
500|$|Matt Norris of Cinema Blend {{stated that}} most of the events portrayed in the episode were unexpected, {{including}} Dualla's suicide, Starbuck finding her own supposed body, discovering the thirteenth tribe were Cylons, and that Ellen Tigh is the final model, but still thought the episode was among the top five Battlestar Galactica episodes in its run. Marc Bernardin of Entertainment Weekly stated that a lot had been going on in the episode, but criticised the writers' decision of having Ellen as the fifth Cylon. While Dualla's suicide was surprising for Bernardin, he was critical about the Adama scene after her suicide, stating it as [...] "some of Olmos' worst acting in the series", and that the answered questions for the episode raised more questions, but felt the episode was good overall. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger commented: [...] "What really grabs me about the show (as I discussed in today's column) is its humanity, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>its</b> characters react to situations the way you imagine real, contemporary people might" [...] and felt that [...] "as the stakes for the characters has risen, so has the intensity of [...] performances," [...] with even the extras in character.

Knowles remained as the lead vocalist in the group's final line-up as a trio, however, Rowland and Williams also took turns in singing lead {{for the majority of}} their songs. Destiny's Child cited R singer Janet Jackson as one of their influences. Ann Powers of The New York Times described Destiny's Child music as [...] "fresh and emotional... these ladies have the best mixes, the savviest samples and especially the most happening beats." [...] In the same publication, Jon Pareles noted that the sound that defines Destiny's Child, aside from Knowles' voice, [...] "is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>its</b> melodies jump in and out of double-time. Above brittle, syncopated rhythm tracks, quickly articulated verses alternate with smoother choruses." [...] The group usually harmonize their vocals in their songs, especially on the ballads. In most instances of their songs, each member sings one verse and chimes in at the chorus. In their third album Survivor (2001), each member sings lead in the majority of the songs. Knowles said, [...] "...everybody {{is a part of the}} music... Everybody is singing lead on every song, and it's so great—because now Destiny's Child is at the point vocally and mentally that it should be at." [...] Knowles, however, completely led songs like [...] "Brown Eyes" [...] and [...] "Dangerously in Love".

500|$|Beginning in 1988, Philip Morris funded a study {{investigating}} {{the air quality}} in the cabin of Scandinavian Airlines planes. Philip Morris then hired the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) to collect data for the study, though the industry, through CIAR, still controlled the study's conclusions and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>its</b> results were presented. Accordingly, CIAR subsequently asked TNO to remove 21 pages of analysis from the report, and TNO complied. In 1992, a CIAR-funded study conducted by Healthy Buildings International was published in Environment International. A Congressional inquiry subsequently found that 25% of the data may have been falsified, although the study's author has disputed this conclusion. Also in 1992, the CIAR awarded $72,760 to Antonio H. Miguel, Jari Cardoso, and Aquino Neto to study indoor air quality in offices and restaurants in the Brazilian cities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The CIAR also awarded Miguel additional funding in 1998 for another indoor air quality study, this time measuring air quality in Santiago, Chile, and Sao Paulo, Brazil. This study {{was based on the}} hypothesis that although both outdoor air and ETS could increase aerosol concentrations indoors, outdoor air was responsible for a significantly larger proportion of indoor aerosol concentrations than ETS was. The CIAR also funded research by Arthur Penn, of New York University, into the effects of exposure to tobacco smoke in chickens from 1990 to 1994. After some of his studies found that this exposure caused increased plaque buildup in the chickens' arteries, the CIAR refused to fund any more of his work. Another study funded by the CIAR was authored by Johns Hopkins researcher Genevieve Matanoski in 1995, and claimed that some cases of lung cancer previously attributed to passive smoking might actually be caused by other factors, such as diet. Another was the [...] "16 cities study", authored by Roger Jenkins and published in 1996, examining levels of second-hand smoke measured by subjects in sixteen different cities at work and at home. The study concluded that homes were a greater source of exposure to second-hand smoke than workplaces, which led the tobacco industry to use its conclusions to argue that workplace smoking restrictions were unnecessary. This study has been criticized for suffering from [...] "serious biases" [...] that led to low values of exposure being reported.|$|E
