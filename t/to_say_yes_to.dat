500|$|Although Drymon had a {{significant}} influence on SpongeBob SquarePants, he was not initially offered a role on the series. As a late recruit to Rocko's Modern Life, he had not established much of a relationship with Hillenburg before SpongeBobs conception. Hillenburg first sought out Drymon's storyboard partner, Mark O'Hare - but O'Hare had just created the soon-to-be syndicated comic strip, Citizen Dog, and while he would later join SpongeBob as a writer, lacked {{the time to get}} involved with both projects at the outset. Drymon has said, [...] "I remember Hillenburg's bringing it up to Mark in our office and asking him if he'd be interested in working on it...I was all ready <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>yes</b> <b>to</b> the offer, but Steve didn't ask; he just left the room. I was pretty desperate...so I ran into the hall after him and basically begged him for the job. He didn't jump at the chance." [...] Once Hillenburg had given it some thought and decided to bring Drymon on as creative director, the two began meeting at Hillenburg's house multiple times a week to develop the series. Drymon has identified this period as having begun in 1996, shortly after the end of Rocko's Modern Life.|$|E

[...] College visits (including overnight ones), interviews, attending College Fair days, comments in the essay, contacting college faculty members, answering and opening emails, place position of the college on the FAFSA form or its FAFSA position, and other indications of interest can be a factor for many colleges concerned about their yield—the percent of students who accept an offer of enrollment. According to Andover's college counseling director Sean Logan, {{it is important to have}} numerous contact points with colleges to show demonstrated interest: visiting, phone contact, emailing, visits to websites (including number of clicks as well as length of time on the website), whether a college visit included a tour and interview, and whether a college-recommended off-campus personal interview was done.

40|$|The {{writings}} of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche speak in countless voices about innumerable questions of life. In this paper a very tentative perspective is provided on a few phenomena related to human wisdom. After introducing Nietzsche's style, some of his comments on the function of knowledge are explored. The emphasis falls on the usefulness of insights, on intellectual arrangement and on historical consciousness. Moving from this, Nietzsche's critical approach to morality is highlighted, with tentative answers to questions {{on the nature of}} moral judgements, the difference between good and evil, modern moralities as being anti-natural, and negative moralistic inclinations to judge, to complain, to find guilt and to lay blame. In contrast to the previous exposition of moralism, the third section deals with Nietzsche's positive approach to rationality, the scientific method and truthfulness, and stresses the overcoming of passions and guilt feelings under the influence of increasing insight. It is argued that a genuine philosopher does not judge others indiscriminately, does not blame circumstances, but takes his stand beyond good and evil. He is spiritually strong enough for every kind of understanding, comprehending and approving. It is pointed out that, for Nietzsche, one of the crucial questions is to see whether the human race could transform itself from a moral to wise mankind, from laying blame <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> <b>yes</b> <b>to</b> life.

Response range. Pettigrew (1958) chose to call it category width. In most of the cases, it is independent of the direction of the items and Abstract Researchers who use surveys and long psychological instruments assume that response sets are constant over time. Data from three studies are presented that challenge this assumption. Questionnaires of different response formats, subjects, and topics were used. Correlations of the response sets across adjacent time periods formed a simplex, suggesting that the response sets across adjacent time periods were more similar than the response sets across distant time periods. The implications of the instability of response sets for the interpretation of social science findings obtained with long instruments are explored...|$|R
