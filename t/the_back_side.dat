5|$|The {{north side}} of the DeKalb County Courthouse is not as ornately {{decorated}} as the south face but each has its own distinctive qualities. The courthouse drive, entering from Exchange Street, crosses below a stone porte-cochere on the courthouse property. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> of the building features four pilasters with composite capitals which give the courthouse a temple appearance.|$|E
5|$|The font design {{featured}} on the front cover was created by Pizz, a graphic artist from Long Beach, who also designed album cover art for several other indie rock bands. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> of the album features a painting by bassist Emery, depicting a topless woman looking at herself through a hand mirror. On her chest is a red heart surrounded by arrows, and below, her ribs protrude from her sides, possibly a reference to anorexia and body image issues, a major theme of the album and its successor Live Through This.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} hypothesis {{suggested by}} Benoit et al. involves {{some kind of}} sensory organ occupying the maxillary fossa. Uniquely among therapsids, the canal within the maxilla is exposed on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> of the maxillary fossa, which implies that the canal, carrying the trigeminal nerve, would probably have extended across the fossa, outside of {{the outline of the}} skull. Benoit et al. hypothesized that the fossa may have supported a specialized sensory organ analogous to the pit organ of pit vipers and some other snakes, or alternatively a ganglion of nerve cells. It is also possible that this organ functioned as a replacement for the parietal eye in Euchambersia, like the pit organ does in pit vipers. However, such an expanded sensory organ would be unprecedented among tetrapods, and the few other therocephalians that also lack a parietal eye do not have a maxillary fossa either. Thus, Benoit et al. considered the venom hypothesis as being more plausible.|$|E

5|$|The upper incisors {{are small}} and flat-crowned and are weakly divided into two lobes. A single large cusp is present on C1, with a smaller shelf at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side.</b> P2 is very small and P4 {{contains}} a high cusp at the front, a smaller cusp before it on the inner (lingual) side, and a shelf behind the high cusp. The length of P4 averages 2.13mm, {{with a standard deviation}} (SD) of 0.104mm, and width is 2.52mm with an SD of 0.168mm. On the first upper molar (M1), the protofossa, a basin between cusps {{at the front of the}} tooth, is closed. The second molar (M2) is similar, but smaller and more squared. M3 is much smaller and has a reduced crown pattern resembling a W.|$|E
5|$|Until 2007, US-89 {{followed}} State Street to North Temple (100 North), {{two blocks}} from the capitol, but now it turns at 400 South, following the former alignment of SR-186 and SR-176 west and north on 300 West, and rejoining its pre-2007 route at North Temple. In this area, modern US-89 runs for one block with the UTA TRAX Red Line in its median before crossing the TRAX line in Main Street's median, then passing the Frank E. Moss United States Courthouse, Pioneer Park, the historic Warehouse District at Pierpont Avenue, Japantown, EnergySolutions Arena, the Arena TRAX station, the Triad Center, and West High School. As it leaves downtown, 300 West curves northwesterly and becomes Beck Street, meeting the modern terminus of SR-186 at Victory Road at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> of Capitol Hill.|$|E
5|$|Pipistrellus raceyi is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} pipistrelle. It is long-furred and the body is reddish above, with the head a trifle darker, and yellowish-brown below. The glandular swellings on the muzzle, next to the nose, are hairless. The dark, short, round ears bear three to five ridges. The crescent-shaped tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is about half as long as the ear and contains a slight constriction on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> of its base. The wings are dark. The third through fifth metacarpals (hand bones) are about equally long, but the first phalange (finger bone) on the third finger is short. P.endoi has a longer first phalange on the third metacarpal. P.raceyi has short tibiae (lower leg bones) and small feet and the tail is shorter than the head and body. Forearm length is 28.0 to 31.2mm (1.10 to 1.23in), tail length is 22.9 to 30.3mm (0.90 to 1.19in), hindfoot length is 5.3 to 7.5mm (0.21 to 0.30in), and ear length is 7.5 to 10.6mm (0.30 to 0.42in) in 13 measured specimens. Females average slightly larger than males.|$|E

5|$|The talonid {{contains}} a hypoconid, hypoconulid, and entoconid and is much {{wider than the}} trigonid because the hypoconid is displaced buccally. A cristid obliqua descends from the hypoconid and reaches the protoconid. Although a crest, the postmetacristid, descends from <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> of the metaconid, ending in a small cusp, the metastylid, it is separated from the entoconid by a notch. The living colugos lack such a strong postmetacristid. The hypoconulid is near the back lingual margin of the tooth, behind the entoconid. In D.major, this cusp is further to the back than in both D.chimaera and the Sunda colugo, while the two cusps are merged in the Philippine colugo. In D.chimaera, a low crest, the post-hypoconulid cristid, reaches from the hypoconulid to the back lingual corner of the tooth, where a small cuspule, the distocuspid, is located. A long crest, the postcristid, connects the distocuspid to the hypoconid along the posterior side of the tooth. The Philippine colugo is similar, but in D.major, both the distocuspid and the post-hypoconulid cristid are absent, and the Sunda colugo has a weaker distocuspid and a postcristid that does not reach further lingually than the hypoconulid.|$|E

50|$|Classical guitars are {{generally}} made with spruce or cedar tops and rosewood or mahogany <b>backs</b> and <b>sides</b> to enhance sustain. Flamenco guitars {{are generally}} made with spruce tops and cypress or sycamore for <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> and <b>sides</b> to enhance volume and emphasize the {{attack of the}} note. Nevertheless, other types of wood {{may be used for}} <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and <b>sides,</b> like rosewood, maple, koa, satinwood and caviuna.|$|R
50|$|The {{color of}} this species is variable, and can be brown, gray, green, or {{yellowish}} above, often with red blotches on the middle of <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> Usually there are between 9 and 13 dark crossbands on <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> <b>sides,</b> and tail, with adjacent white spots. These crossbands can be pronounced or covered with reddish or yellowish color.|$|R

25|$|The {{cross-sectional}} {{shape of the}} hob teeth are almost the same shape as teeth of a rack gear {{that would be used}} with the finished product. There are slight changes to the shape for generating purposes, such as extending the hob's tooth length to create a clearance in the gear's roots. Each hob tooth is relieved on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> to reduce friction.|$|E
25|$|The {{dream of}} a {{shipping}} canal connecting the Mississippi River to Lake Pontchartrain goes back to Spanish colonial times (1763â1803). The colonial era Carondelet Canal connected <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> of the French Quarter with the lake via Bayou St. John, {{but it was not}} extended to the river because of the differing levels of the river and the lake. Engineers confirmed that canal locks would be necessary.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the layers}} have been quilted, the edges must be {{finished}} and bound. There {{are many different}} ways to bind a quilt. One of the simplest involves sewing {{one side of a}} strip of fabric to the front side of the quilt, through all of the layers of fabric, then folding the strip over to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> of the fabric and hand stitching the binding closed.|$|E
25|$|The cello is {{typically}} made from carved wood, although other {{materials such as}} carbon fiber or aluminum may be used. A traditional cello has a spruce top, with maple for <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> <b>sides,</b> and neck. Other woods, such as poplar or willow, are sometimes used for <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and <b>sides.</b> Less expensive cellos frequently have tops and backs made of laminated wood. Laminated cellos are widely used in {{elementary and secondary school}} orchestras and youth orchestras, because they are much more durable than carved wood cellos (i.e., {{they are less likely to}} crack if bumped or dropped) and they are much less expensive.|$|R

50|$|The {{scales of}} E. multicarinata are keeled on <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> <b>sides,</b> and legs. There are 14 rows of scales across <b>the</b> <b>back</b> at <b>the</b> {{middle of the}} body. A band of smaller {{granular}} scales separates the larger scales on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and stomach, creating a fold along {{each side of the}} animal. These folds allow the body to expand to hold food or eggs.|$|R
25|$|Various {{artefacts}} {{of daily}} life are also clearly Hellenistic: sundials, ink wells, tableware. An almost life-sized dark green glass phallus with a small owl on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> and other treasures {{are said to have}} been discovered at Ai-Khanoum, possibly along with a stone with an inscription, which was not recovered. The artefacts have now been returned to the Kabul Museum after several years in Switzerland by Paul Bucherer-Dietschi, Director of the Swiss Afghanistan Institute.|$|E
25|$|Another ancient {{method of}} holding the work is the hold fast or {{holdfast}}. A holdfast looks like a shepherd's crook. The shank goes into {{a hole in the}} bench top and the tip of the hook is pressed against the work from above. The holdfast is set by rapping the top with a mallet, and released by hitting <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side.</b> A good holdfast works remarkably well, and is inexpensive and easy to install.|$|E
25|$|Isolated {{characters}} from the Byblos syllabary {{have also been}} found on various other objects, such as axes and pottery. Also, a spatula is known which has on the front side a Phoenician inscription and on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> traces of a Proto-Byblian inscriptionâabout half a dozen proto-Byblian characters are recognizable. The Phoenician inscription on this spatula is dated to the 10th century BC which suggests that Pseudo-hieroglyphs may have remained in use longer than is usually assumed.|$|E
