5|$|Generally, {{the player}} starts {{out with a}} Dungeon Heart and some Imps. The Dungeon Heart has the same purpose as the {{original}} game: it serves as the dungeon's life force. If destroyed, the player loses. In Dungeon Keeper 2, the heart has additional functions: regenerating mana (used to cast spells), doubling as a gold-storage area, producing Imps, and sending certain creatures to investigate threats it detects. Gold is <b>the</b> <b>currency</b> <b>used</b> to construct rooms, traps, and doors, and pay minions. Gold is obtained primarily by digging gold and gem seams, the latter providing an unlimited supply. This is performed by the Imps, the main workforce of the dungeon, who dig and claim tiles for the player to control. Another main task Imps perform is the fortification of walls adjacent to tiles owned by the player, although this no longer makes them impenetrable to enemies, but merely makes digging take longer.|$|E
5|$|The pound {{sterling}} is <b>the</b> <b>currency</b> <b>used</b> in Wales. Numerous Welsh banks issued their own banknotes in the 19th century. The last bank {{to do so}} closed in 1908; since then, although banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland continue {{to have the right}} to issue banknotes in their own countries, the Bank of England has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in Wales. The Commercial Bank of Wales, established in Cardiff by Sir Julian Hodge in 1971, was taken over by the Bank of Scotland in 1988 and absorbed into its parent company in 2002. The Royal Mint, who issue the coinage circulated through the whole of the UK, have been based at a single site in Llantrisant since 1980. Since decimalisation, in 1971, at least one of the coins in UK circulation has depicted a Welsh design, e.g. the 1995 and 2000 one Pound coin (above). However, Wales has not been represented on any coin minted from 2008.|$|E
25|$|Takeover paper. Convertibles have a {{place as}} <b>the</b> <b>currency</b> <b>used</b> in takeovers. The bidder can offer a higher income on a {{convertible}} than the dividend yield on a bid victim’s shares, without having to raise the dividend yield on all the bidder’s shares. This eases the process for a bidder with low-yield shares acquiring a company with higher-yielding shares. Perversely, the lower the yield on the bidder’s shares, {{the easier it is}} for the bidder to create a higher conversion premium on the convertible, with consequent benefits for the mathematics of the takeover. In the 1980s, UK domestic convertibles accounted for about 80pct of the European convertibles market, and over 80pct of these were issued either as takeover currency or as funding for takeovers. They had several cosmetic attractions.|$|E

25|$|The cost {{of heavy}} nectar also impacts <b>the</b> <b>currency</b> <b>used</b> by the bees. Unlike the {{starlings}} {{in the previous}} example, bees maximize energy efficiency (energy gained per energy spent) rather than net rate of energy gain (net energy gained per time). This is because the optimal load predicted by maximizing net rate of energy gain is too heavy for the bees and shortens their lifespan, decreasing their overall productivity for the hive, as explained earlier. By maximizing energy efficiency, the bees are able to avoid expending too much energy per trip {{and are able to}} live long enough to maximize their lifetime productivity for their hive. In a different paper, Schmid-Hempel showed that the observed relationship between load size and flight time is well correlated with the predictions based on maximizing energy efficiency, but very poorly correlated with the predictions based on maximizing net rate of energy gain.|$|E

2500|$|Anglo-Saxon silver pennies were <b>the</b> <b>currency</b> <b>used</b> {{to pay the}} Danegeld, {{essentially}} protection money paid to the Vikings so {{that they}} would go away and not ravage the land. As an illustration of how heavy a burden the Danegeld was, more Anglo-Saxon pennies from the decades around the first millennium have been found in Denmark than in England. In the reign of Ethelred the Unready (978–1016), some 40 million pennies were paid to the Danes, while King Canute (Knut) (1016–1035) paid off his invasion army with another 20 million pennies. This adds up to about [...] of silver, equivalent to £250,000 at the time, and worth about £10 million in [...] money (its purchasing power at that time may have exceeded £100 million and may have been as high as £1 billion in 2005).|$|E
2500|$|The Federal Reserve System is {{composed}} of several layers. It is governed by the presidentially appointed Board of Governors or Federal Reserve Board (FRB). Twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, located in cities throughout the nation, oversee the privately owned U.S. member banks. Nationally chartered commercial banks are required to hold stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of their region, which entitles them to elect some of their board members. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets monetary policy; it consists of all seven members of the Board of Governors and the twelve regional bank presidents, though only five bank presidents vote at any given time: {{the president of the}} New York Fed and four others who rotate through one-year terms. There are also various advisory councils. Thus, the Federal Reserve System has both public and private components. The structure is considered unique among central banks. It is also unusual in that the United States Department of the Treasury, an entity outside of the central bank, prints <b>the</b> <b>currency</b> <b>used.</b>|$|E
