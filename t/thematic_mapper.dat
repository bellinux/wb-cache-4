50|$|Landsat 6, {{equipped}} with upgraded {{versions of the}} instruments on Landsat 5, was designed to carry forward the Landsat program. It was launched on October 5, 1993 with a Titan II launch vehicle, but failed to reach orbit. Landsat 6 omitted the Multi-Spectral Scanner found on its predecessors, but carried an Enhanced <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper,</b> which improved on the previous <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> by adding a 15m-resolution panchromatic band.|$|E
50|$|OLI {{collects}} {{data from}} nine spectral bands. Seven {{of the nine}} bands {{are consistent with the}} <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> (TM) and Enhanced <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> Plus (ETM+) sensors found on earlier Landsat satellites, providing for compatibility with the historical Landsat data, while also improving measurement capabilities. Two new spectral bands, a deep blue coastal / aerosol band and a shortwave-infrared cirrus band, will be collected, allowing scientists to measure water quality and improve detection of high, thin clouds.|$|E
50|$|Landsat 4 {{carried an}} updated Multi-Spectral Scanner used on {{previous}} Landsat satellites, and a <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper.</b> It had a maximum 30 m resolution.|$|E
50|$|The {{accompanying}} Landsat <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> image shows a false-color infrared image {{looking down}} at the same area in 30-meter pixels, or picture elements, for the same coordinate points, pixel by pixel, as the elevation information.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> {{has become}} a useful tool {{in the study of}} albedo and its {{relationship}} to global warming and climate change. The TM on the Landsat 5 has proven useful in determining the amount of ice loss on glaciers due to melting.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the large}} size of wetlands, mapping is an {{effective}} tool to monitor wetlands. There are many remote sensing methods {{that can be used}} to map wetlands. Remote-sensing technology permits the acquisition of timely digital data on a repetitive basis. This repeat coverage allows wetlands, as well as the adjacent land-cover and land-use types, to be monitored seasonally and/or annually. Using digital data provides a standardized data-collection procedure and an opportunity for data integration within a geographic information system. Traditionally, Landsat 5 <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> Plus (ETM+), and the SPOT 4 and 5 satellite systems have been used for this purpose. More recently, however, multispectral IKONOS and QuickBird data, with spatial resolutions of 4 by 4 m and 2.44 by 2.44 m, respectively, have been shown to be excellent sources of data when mapping and monitoring smaller wetland habitats and vegetation communities.|$|E

5000|$|According {{to their}} interpretations of Landsat Enhanced <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> Plus (ETM + [...] ) images, Radarsat-1 data, and SRTM data, El-Baz and Ghoneim {{described}} this circular feature {{as having a}} central peak, an inner ring, and discontinuous outer rim. The hypothetical outer rim is 31 kilometres (19 mi) in diameter. This feature consists of well-cemented, coarse- and fine-grained sandstones of the Gilf Kebir and Wadi Malik formations.|$|E
50|$|A GIS {{was used}} to {{register}} and combine the two images to render the three-dimensional perspective view looking down the San Andreas Fault, using the <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> image pixels, but shaded using the elevation of the landforms. The GIS display depends on the viewing point of the observer and time of day of the display, to properly render the shadows created by the sun's rays at that latitude, longitude, and time of day.|$|E
50|$|Landsat 5 had {{a maximum}} {{transmission}} bandwidth of 85 Mbit/s. It was deployed {{at an altitude}} of 705.3 km, and it took about 16 days to scan the entire Earth. The satellite was an identical copy of Landsat 4 and was originally intended as a backup. Therefore, Landsat 5 carried the same instruments, including the <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> and Multi-Spectral Scanner. The Multi-Spectral Scanner was powered down in 1995, but reactivated again in 2012.|$|E
50|$|Presently, Parinacota is dormant, but future {{volcanic}} activity is possible. Explicit fumarolic activity {{has not been}} observed, but satellite imaging has shown the evidence of thermal anomalies {{on the scale of}} , and reports of sulfurous smells at the summit imply that a fumarole may exist in the summit area. The volcano is seismically active including one potential seismic swarm, but earthquake activity is less than Guallatiri farther south. Based on Landsat <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> images, it was considered a potentially active volcano in 1991.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> (TM) {{is one of}} the Earth observing sensors {{introduced}} in the Landsat program. The first was placed aboard Landsat 4 (decommissioned in 2001), and another was operational aboard Landsat 5 up to 2012. [...] TM sensors feature seven bands of image data (three in visible wavelengths, four in infrared) most of which have 30 metre spatial resolution. TM is a whisk broom scanner which takes multi-spectral images across its ground track. It does not directly produce a thematic map.|$|E
5000|$|Fumarole {{temperatures}} {{appear to}} be so low (less than 100 C) that in 1989 the exhalations could not be detected in the <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> infrared band of the Landsat satellite even during night. More recent satellite observations have shown the existence of hotspots of about the relatively poor visibility of the hotspots in satellite images contrasts with the good visibility of the fumarole {{from the ground and}} may reflect the relatively small surface area of the hotspots, which makes them difficult to isolate in satellite images.|$|E
50|$|Among {{tropical}} nations, Brazil {{probably has}} the world's best monitoring of deforestation activity. Estimates {{are produced by}} Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE) for the entire Brazilian Legal Amazon by visually interpreting satellite imagery from the Landsat <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper.</b> The relevance of the CBERS program does not limit itself only to applications of the satellite-generated images. The program also takes part in the Space Activities National Program (PNAE) which objective is {{to lead the country}} toward the autonomy of this technology, vital in a path to sustainable development.|$|E
50|$|To {{accurately}} map the Amazon's biomass {{and subsequent}} carbon related emissions, {{the classification of}} tree growth stages within {{different parts of the}} forest is crucial. In 2006 Tatiana Kuplich organized the trees of the Amazon into four categories: (1) mature forest, (2) regenerating forest than three years, (3) regenerating forest three and five years of regrowth, and (4) regenerating forest to eighteen years of continued development. The researcher used a combination of Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> (TM) to accurately place the different portions of the Amazon into one of the four classifications.|$|E
50|$|Landsat 7 was {{designed}} to last for five years, and {{has the capacity to}} collect and transmit up to 532 images per day. It is in a polar, sun-synchronous orbit, meaning it scans across the entire earth's surface. With an altitude of 705 kilometers +/- 5 kilometers, it takes 232 orbits, or 16 days, to do so. The satellite weighs 1973 kg, is 4.04 m long, and 2.74 m in diameter. Unlike its predecessors, Landsat 7 has a solid state memory of 378 gigabits (roughly 100 images). The main instrument on board Landsat 7 is the Enhanced <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> Plus (ETM+).|$|E
50|$|Landsat 4 was {{the first}} {{satellite}} in the Landsat program to incorporate the TM (<b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper)</b> sensor. The Landsat TM sensor is able to gather seven bands of data {{as opposed to the}} four bands of data collected from the MSS (Multispectral Scanner.) In addition to having three more bands of data to work with, scientists are able to view the TM data at a much higher resolution than with MSS. Bands 1-5 and 7 each have a spatial resolution of 30m while the MSS is only offered in a 57m by 79m resolution. Band 6 (which is a Thermal infrared band) has a maximum spatial resolution of 120m.|$|E
50|$|In August 1998, NASA {{contracted}} EarthSat {{to produce}} Landsat GeoCover (Geocover 2000 in NASA World Wind) — a positionally accurate orthorectified Landsat <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> and Multispectral Scanner imagery covering {{the majority of}} the Earth's land mass. The contract was part of the NASA Scientific Data Purchase which was administrated through NASA's John C. Stennis Space Center. GeoCover was later enhanced to EarthSat NaturalVue, a simulatednatural color Landsat 7 derived c. year 2000, orthorectified, mosaicked and color balanced digital image dataset. Other commercial simulated true color 15-meter global imagery products built from the NASA Landsat 7 imagery include TerraColor from Earthstar Geographics, TruEarth (found in Google Earth and Google Maps) from TerraMetrics, BrightEarth from ComputaMaps, simulated natural color from Atlogis and a product of i-cubed used in World Wind.|$|E
50|$|Selective logging {{or partial}} forest removal is the {{practice}} of cutting down one or two species of trees while leaving the rest intact. Selective logging is often considered a better alternative to clear cutting in which a large area of a forest is cut down, leaving little behind except wood debris and a deforested landscape.Selective logging in the Brazilian Amazon was recently shown in analyses of Landsat Enhanced <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> Plus data at high spatial resolution to be occurring at rates of about 12,000-20,000 km2 per year, thus indicating {{the central role of}} selective logging in tropical forest disturbance.Although selective logging has a far less impact on forest processes than deforestation, selectively logged sites experience higher rates of forest fires,tree fall, changes in microclimate, soil compaction and erosion, among other impacts.|$|E
50|$|His largest known body of {{research}} comes from the archaeology of the Maya site of Cerén, or Joya de Cerén, in the Zapotitan Valley of El Salvador which has been ongoing since its discovery in 1978. Cerén {{is known as the}} Pompeii of North America as it was preserved under hot volcanic ash from Loma Caldera’s eruption around the year 600 and provides a snapshot in time of the everyday village life of the ancient Maya. Sheets is the primary archaeologist for the University of Colorado’s excavations at Cerén. He has also done extensive work at Arenal in Costa Rica (also covered in volcanic ash) where he used remote sensing technology (including infrared photography, LiDAR, thermal infrared spectroscopy, synthetic aperture radar data, and spectral bands from Landsat's <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper)</b> in a jungle environment, developing one of the largest remote sensing databases used for archaeology at the time.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: False-color {{composite}} (processed {{to simulate}} true color) {{image of the}} island of Hawaii was constructed from data gathered between 1999 and 2001 by the Enhanced <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> plus (ETM+) instrument, flying aboard the Landsat 7 satellite. The Landsat data was processed by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to develop a landcover map. The black areas on the island (in this scene) that resemble a pair of sun-baked palm fronds are hardened lava flows formed by the active Mauna Loa Volcano. Just {{to the north of}} Mauna Loa is the dormant grayish Mauna Kea Volcano, which hasn’t erupted in an estimated 3,500 years. A thin greyish plume of smoke is visible near the island’s southeastern shore, rising from Kilauea—the most active volcano on Earth. Heavy rainfall and fertile volcanic soil have given rise to Hawaii’s lush tropical forests, which appear as solid dark green areas in the image. The light green, patchy areas near the coasts are likely sugar cane plantations, pineapple farms, and human settlements.|$|E
5000|$|Landsat {{missions}} 1 through 5 {{carried the}} Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS), while missions 4 and 5 used the Landsat <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> (TM) scanner. The Multispectral Scanner had a 230 mm (9 in) fused silica dinner-plate mirror epoxy bonded to three invar tangent bars mounted to {{base of a}} Ni/Au brazed Invar frame in a Serrurier truss that was arranged with four [...] "Hobbs-Links" [...] (conceived by Dr. Gregg Hobbs), crossing at mid-truss. This construct ensured the secondary mirror would simply oscillate about the primary optic axis to maintain focus despite vibration inherent from the 360 mm (14 in) beryllium scan mirror. This engineering solution allowed the United States to develop LANDSAT {{at least five years}} ahead of the French SPOT, which first used CCD arrays to stare without need for a scanner. However, LANDSAT data prices climbed from $250 per computer compatible data tape and $10 for black-and-white print to $4,400 for data tape and $2,700 for black-and-white print by 1984, making SPOT data a much more affordable option for satellite imaging data. This was {{a direct result of the}} commercialization efforts begun under the Carter administration, though finally completed under the Reagan administration.|$|E
5000|$|Soil {{surveys show}} that the {{location}} of the dam may have been near the city of Ubar. [...] "During mapping for the Wadi al Jubal Archaeological Project in Yemen, USGS Geologists Overstreet and Grolier mapped anthrosols of pre-Islamic age east of the Ma'rib dam site (15 degrees 24’N, 45 degrees 18’E). These soils were the result of agriculture supported by irrigation enabled by water impounded by the dam, areas which were abandoned after dam failure. During analysis of Landsat <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> satellite images of Yemen and Oman for the Mahra Archaeological Project, we noted that these anthrosols had a distinctive image expression. Many anthrosol sites were noted, most, but not all, of them previously documented. Undocumented possible anthrosol sites include an area east of Shisr in Oman, the archaeological site discovered by us to be responsible for some features of the Lost City of Ubar legends. Included in legendary accounts of the Ubar region are reports of fertile oases, and areas that have known the plow. Based on demonstrated reliability of aspects of carefully interpreted legendary accounts, we postulate that we may have located the area of desert agriculture that may have existed to support the frankincense caravansary of Ubar. The possible anthrosol area is located at approximately 18 degrees 10’N, 53 degrees 54’E, and will be the subject of study in a future expedition." ...|$|E
