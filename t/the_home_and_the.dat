5|$|In England, {{prior to}} the nineteenth century, common law {{considered}} children to be the property of their father. However, {{the economic and social}} changes that occurred during the nineteenth century lead to a shift in ideas about the dynamics of the family. Industrialization separated <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> workplace, keeping fathers away from their children in order to earn wages and provide for their family. Conversely, mothers were expected to stay in the home and care for the household and the children. Important social changes such as women's suffrage and child development theories allowed for ideas surrounding the importance of maternal care.|$|E
5|$|Robert Frank, a {{professor}} of child development at Oakton Community College in Illinois, conducted a study comparing households with a stay-at-home dad and households with a stay-at-home mom. His study concluded that women were still able to form a strong bond with their children despite working full-time outside the home. Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their children {{on a day-to-day basis}} than their male counterparts. His study concluded that in a family with a stay-at-home dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong. This contrasts with the more traditional family structure where the father works outside <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study found that both parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child.|$|E

Gitanjali (Song Offerings), Gora (Fair-Faced) and Ghare-Baire (<b>The</b> <b>Home</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> World) are his best-known works, and his verse, short stories, and novels were acclaimed—or panned—for their lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural contemplation. His compositions were chosen by two nations as national anthems: India's Jana Gana Mana and Bangladesh's Amar Shonar Bangla. The Sri Lankan national anthem {{was inspired by}} his work.|$|E

25|$|Any {{risk that}} can be {{quantified}} can potentially be insured. Specific kinds of risk that may give rise to claims are known as perils.

25|$|Women's {{historians have}} debated {{the effect of}} the Industrial Revolution and {{capitalism}} generally on the status of women. Taking a pessimistic side, Alice Clark argued that when capitalism arrived in 17th century England, it lowered the status of women as they lost much of their economic importance. Clark argues that in 16th century England, women were engaged in many aspects of industry and agriculture. The home was a central unit of production and women played a vital role in running farms, and in some trades and landed estates. Their useful economic roles gave them a sort of equality with their husbands. However, Clark argues, as capitalism expanded in the 17th century, there was more and more division of labour with the husband taking paid labour jobs outside <b>the</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wife reduced to unpaid household work. Middle- and upper-class women were confined to an idle domestic existence, supervising servants; lower-class women were forced to take poorly paid jobs. Capitalism, therefore, had a negative effect on powerful women.|$|E
