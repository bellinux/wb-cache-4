5|$|Both teams {{entered the}} tiebreaker with long {{histories}} {{of frustration and}} disappointment. California had won the AL West division title on 3 occasions (1979, 1982, and 1986), but failed to advance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Series</b> each time. In particular, the Angels blew a 2–0 series lead in the best-of-five 1982 ALCS to the Milwaukee Brewers, and were one strike away from defeating the Boston Red Sox in Game 5 of the 1986 ALCS but ended up losing that game and the next two to lose the best-of-seven series that they had led 3–1. They had not returned to the postseason since the 1986 loss.|$|E

In 1953, the team moved from Boston to Milwaukee, where it {{was known as the}} Milwaukee Braves. Its first manager in Milwaukee was Charlie Grimm, who managed the team from mid-season of 1952 to mid-season of 1956.

Alston {{received}} some media attention when he considered using Marshall as a starter. Marshall ended up appearing in all five games of the series and gave up one run in nine innings, {{but he did not}} start a game. The Dodgers lost the series four games to one. The 1975 and 1976 Dodgers won 88 and 92 games respectively, but they finished well out of first place in both seasons.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, West {{made his}} first World Series {{appearance}} when the Atlanta Braves faced the Toronto Blue Jays.

He worked another no-hitter on April 8, 1994, when Kent Mercker shut down the Los Angeles Dodgers. The 1995 NLDS was West’s first League Division Series. The following year West worked in the NLCS.
