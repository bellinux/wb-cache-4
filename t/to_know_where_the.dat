PaleyFest panel that the writers {{are able to}} read the screenplays for upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe films <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> universe is heading, which allowed them to form a plan for the show through the end of a third season. On May 8, 2014, the series was renewed for a second season of 22 episodes.|$|E
5|$|As {{opposed to}} film makers, virtual camera system creators {{have to deal}} with a world that is {{interactive}} and unpredictable. It is not possible <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> player's character {{is going to be in}} the next few seconds; therefore, it is not possible to plan the shots as a film maker would do. To solve this issue, the system relies on certain rules or artificial intelligence to select the most appropriate shots.|$|E
25|$|If {{there was}} a war going on nobody seemed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> front was. Nevertheless the general staff of the Zaire army was {{claiming}} to have begun a general offensive against the enemy and claimed to have surrounded the town of Mutshatsha.|$|E

25|$|Jennifer Van Bergen, a {{journalist}} with a law degree, {{responds to the}} comment that habeas corpus has never been afforded to foreign combatants with the suggestion that, using the current sweeping definition of {{war on terror and}} unlawful combatant, it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> battlefield is and who combatants are. Also, she notes that most of the detentions are already unlawful.|$|E
25|$|The {{fast moving}} {{frontline}} meant that army headquarters {{lost touch with}} its forward units. The collapse of communications deprived commanders and squadrons of orders, a situation exacerbated {{by the lack of}} a common radio frequency and by over-stretched logistics, which also forced them to scavenge enemy supply depots. Richthofen was the most affected. As early as 3 September, he noted in his diary that the army headquarters had ceased <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> frontline was, and he refused to respond to army requests for air support. Instead, he responded according to his own interpretation of the situation. This method did cause friendly fire incidents. On one occasion, Ju 87s knocked out a bridge across the Vistula river when a Panzer Division was about to cross.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrary}} to economic reasons described by India and Pakistan, common fishermen {{of both countries}} get trapped in conflict and their economic rights of earning get affected. It has seen that government of India and Pakistan regularly arrest fishermen of each other for crossing the boundary, however for a common fisherman, {{it is always a}} wonder <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> boundary starts and ends in sea. This unawareness are added with wind flow, waves and turbulence that push the boat in sea. While UN law advocates for minimum penalty for this offence and release of boats, but government of India and Pakistan catch these prisoners and keep them in prisons for long time. It is more unfortunate that their release happens through land boundary of India and Pakistan (Wagha border) and these poor fishermen come to their home country without their boats.|$|E

The series was renewed for that third season on May 7, 2015. By April 2015, Marvel had been developing a spinoff series to accompany the season, starring Adrianne Palicki and Nick Blood, but ABC opted not to go ahead with it, with entertainment president Paul Lee saying, [...] "We thought the right thing now is to leave [...] on S.H.I.E.L.D., because S.H.I.E.L.D. is so strong [...] the moment".|$|E
500|$|Derek Elley of Variety found The Hurt Locker to be [...] "gripping" [...] as {{a thriller}} but {{felt that the}} film was {{weakened}} by, [...] "its fuzzy (and hardly original) psychology." [...] Elley wrote that it was unclear <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> drama lay: [...] "These guys get by on old-fashioned guts and instinct rather than sissy hardware—but it's not a pure men-under-stress drama either." [...] The critic also felt that the script showed [...] "signs of artificially straining for character depth." [...] Anne Thompson, also writing for Variety, believed The Hurt Locker to be a contender for Best Picture, particularly based on the unique subject matter pursued by a female director and on being an exception to other films about the Iraq War, which had performed poorly.|$|E
500|$|Arthur Max {{designed}} the sets {{such as the}} alien world landscape and structures, and the vehicles, including the Prometheus and the Engineer's ship. Digital 3D models and miniature replicas of each set were built to allow the designers to envisage the connections between them and <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> CGI elements would be inserted. To better blend the practical and the digital, the design team took rock samples from the Iceland location so they could match the graphical textures with the real rocks. To create the Prometheus, Max researched NASA and European Space Agency spacecraft designs, and extended these concepts with his own ideas of how future space vehicles might look. He said that he wanted [...] "to do something that was state-of-the-art, which would represent a flagship spacecraft with every technology required to probe into the deepest corners of the galaxy." ...|$|E

500|$|Ravel then {{attempts}} to keep The Nameless One there by force. After the Nameless One {{and his party}} leave the maze, Ravel gets up, having actually survived the encounter. The Transcendent One appears, and, after a short conversation, kills Ravel. Following this, The Nameless One travels {{to the city of}} Curst, a gate town on the border of the Outlands and Carceri, to meet and free Trias. Through a tip from Trias, who claims not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>The</b> Nameless One's mortality lies, The Nameless One then visits the Outlands and Baator, where he learns that his mortality lies in the Fortress of Regrets and that only Trias knows how to access this place. Meanwhile, however, the city of Curst has [...] "slid" [...] from the border of the Outlands to the neighboring chaotic plane Carceri due to the chaos unleashed by Trias after The Nameless One freed him. After a fight, Trias tells The Nameless One that the portal to the Fortress of Regrets is located in Sigil's mortuary, in the very room where the game began.|$|E
500|$|Shawn and Gus {{return and}} inform Raylene that David {{is still alive}} and living at the cemetery. Shawn talks to detective Lassiter and tells him of his plan to put the criminals back in prison due to parole violations; Lassiter denies Shawn's idea, wanting to find the money {{and put an end}} to the case. Determined, Shawn and Gus visit the robber's hotel room, in order to find {{evidence}} to put them back in prison. However, they are caught in the process. In an attempt to save themselves, Shawn tells the men that David wants them <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> money is and that they shouldn't harm Raylene; the robbers inform them that Raylene was actually the mastermind of the plan. Shawn and Gus rush back to the cemetery to find Raylene threatening to shoot David if she doesn't get the money. Shawn stalls long enough for the robbers, Juliet, and Lassiter to show up, and David and Raylene are arrested. Shawn then [...] "psychically" [...] locates the money.|$|E
500|$|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. {{executive}} producer Jeffrey Bell revealed at the show's 2014 PaleyFest panel that the producers and writers {{are able to}} read the screenplays for upcoming MCU films <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> universe is heading. He noted that since the films have to be [...] "big" [...] and move [...] "quickly through a lot of huge pieces", it is beneficial for the films to have the television series fill in any [...] "gaps" [...] for them. His fellow {{executive producer}} Jed Whedon explained that each Marvel project is intended to standalone first before there is any interweaving, and noted that the series has {{to be aware of the}} film division's plans so as not to interfere when introducing someone or something to the universe. Bell said this was preferable so that people who do not watch the films can still follow the series, and vice versa. Joss Whedon noted that this process [...] "unfortunately just means the TV show gets, you know, leftovers." [...] He stated that, for example, the series' creative team initially wanted to use Loki's scepter from The Avengers but were unable due to his plans for it in [...]|$|E
50|$|PAMs {{were given}} a basic {{training}} in first aid and {{in the use of}} stirrup pumps.

60|$|Legree {{stepped out}} into a large entry, which went up stairs, by what had {{formerly}} been a superb winding staircase; but the passage-way was dirty and dreary, encumbered with boxes and unsightly litter. The stairs, uncarpeted, seemed winding up, in <b>the</b> gloom, <b>to</b> nobody <b>knew</b> <b>where!</b> <b>The</b> pale moonlight streamed through a shattered fanlight over the door; the air was unwholesome and chilly, {{like that of a}} vault.|$|R

500|$|The series {{initially}} gained {{interest from}} major terrestrial networks {{such as the}} BBC and ITV. However, Max Beesley and Philip Glenister grew frustrated with the comments from the commissioning teams from the networks. Glenister stated that [...] "the problem with the BBC and ITV is more people coming in and telling you what to do; we are grown up and big enough <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> boundaries are". They ultimately settled for Sky, as the network was [...] "the one that we believed would let us do what we wanted". In January 2012, Glenister believed their decision to go with Sky was [...] "vindicated", as the terrestrial networks would restrict its content, violence, and language. He stated that the restrictions would not make the series [...] "the show it is and it wouldn't be the show we wanted to make". Head of Sky Drama Elaine Pyke had an immediate interest in the project, as she was [...] "immediately grabbed by how thrilling, scary, and funny it is", believing it to be [...] "the perfect show for Sky1". In a separate interview, Beesley stated: [...] "Andy Harries basically put the show out to {{a few of the}} networks and Sky said, 'Here's the money, go and make it and we'll give you notes later on, but really do have the freedom to make it,' which is great, and there's not a lot of that happens nowadays." ...|$|E
2500|$|In baseball, {{a player}} {{correcting}} an umpire's call {{to his own}} team's detriment is unheard of, {{at least at the}} professional level. Individual responsibility and vigilance are part of the game's tradition. It is the umpire's responsibility to make the right call, and matters of judgment are final. Similarly, when a runner misses a base or leaves too early on a caught fly ball, the umpire keeps silent, as it is the fielder's responsibility <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> runners are and to make an appeal. When a fielder pretends not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> ball is (the [...] "hidden ball trick"), the umpire keeps silent, as it is the runner's responsibility <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> ball is.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{boats are}} bow-coxed or 'bowloaders' with the coxswain {{lying in the}} bow behind the bowman rather than stern-coxed or 'sternloader', with the coxswain sitting in the stern {{opposite}} the Stroke. [...] Bowloader eights are rare due {{to the length of}} the boat, this would make it difficult for the cox <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> stern is.|$|E
60|$|Never was a Family more insistent on {{learning}} one another's movements {{than were the}} Bunch.

Babbitt found himself explaining to Carrie or Fulton Bemis just {{what he had been}} doing that he should not have joined them till ten o'clock, and apologizing for having gone to dinner with a business acquaintance.|$|R
50|$|From the {{signalling}} system perspective, the first figure shows the total occupancy {{of the leading}} train by including the whole blocks which the train is located on. This {{is due to the}} fact that it is impossible for <b>the</b> system <b>to</b> <b>know</b> exactly <b>where</b> <b>the</b> train actually is within these blocks. Therefore, the fixed block system only allows the following train to move up to the last unoccupied block's border.|$|R

2500|$|The Cantometrics {{team also}} created a set of {{teaching}} tapes that {{make it easy to}} develop an understanding of world music and to create new song profiles. “Cantometrics helps you to break music down into its parts,” Roswell Rudd told Gideon D’Arcangelo. “You want to know how it’s put together and then you want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> parts came from. The Cantometrics teaching tapes are the best thing anybody can use who wants to understand world music, classical music, pop music, whatever.

2500|$|The Texians demanded <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> other captives were. The Penateka spokesman, Chief Muguara, {{responded that}} the other prisoners were held by various other bands of Comanche. He assured the Texians that he felt the other captives {{would be able to}} be ransomed, but that it would be in {{exchange}} for a great deal of supplies, including ammunition and blankets. He then finished his speech with the comment [...] "How do you like that answer?" [...] The Texian militia entered the courtroom and positioned themselves at intervals along the walls. When the Comanches would not, or could not, promise to return all captives immediately, the Texas officials said that the chiefs would be held hostage until the white captives were released.|$|E
2500|$|Much {{like other}} Barcelona youth {{products}} such as Pep Guardiola, Xavi and Iván de la Peña, Iniesta is a playmaker who relies on exceptional creative passing, intuition and inventiveness to control the midfield and dictate {{the ebb and flow}} of play. Iniesta has been praised for his understanding and interplay with Xavi; former Barcelona teammate Giovanni van Bronckhorst said of the pair, [...] "They have a special relationship, they always have, they just seem <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> other one is." [...] During his maturation as a player, he has gained a reputation for playing a part in important goals for club and country, specifically playing a leading role in the 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2015 UEFA Champions League finals, as well as the 2010 World Cup Final, Euro 2012 final and Euro 2008 semi-final.|$|E
