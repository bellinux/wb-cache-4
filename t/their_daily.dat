5|$|During the Japanese colonial era, Japanese {{settlers}} mainly used Japanese in <b>their</b> <b>daily</b> discourse, and Japanese was the {{lingua franca}} used for communication between Japanese and Palauans. English was also recognised as a co-official language along with Japanese, and many Japanese {{had at least}} some knowledge of the language as well. People of mixed Japanese-Palauan heritage were more competent in Japanese than to Palauan, especially those who attended mainstream primary schools. The Japanese also introduced {{the use of the}} Katakana script in Palauan, which was also used in informal settings. After the Japanese surrender, the use of Japanese was discouraged in place of Palauan and English. Most Japanese-Palauans use Palauan in <b>their</b> <b>daily</b> discourse in favour of Japanese or English, although Japanese was used more frequently among Japanese-Palauans than to those that do not have Japanese ancestry. As the number of Japanese tourists increased during the 1990s, Japanese was introduced as an elective subject to Palauan schools and in elections.|$|E

5|$|Feathers require {{maintenance}} and birds preen or groom them daily, spending {{an average of}} around 9% of <b>their</b> <b>daily</b> time on this. The bill is used to brush away foreign particles and to apply waxy secretions from the uropygial gland; these secretions protect the feathers' flexibility and act as an antimicrobial agent, inhibiting the growth of feather-degrading bacteria. This may be supplemented with the secretions of formic acid from ants, which birds receive through a behaviour known as anting, to remove feather parasites.|$|E
