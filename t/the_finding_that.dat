5|$|Evidence for grapheme-color synesthesia comes {{also from}} <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> <b>that</b> colors can be {{flexibly}} associated to graphemes, as new meanings become assigned to those graphemes.

5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> <b>that</b> the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, the amyloid {{hypothesis}} {{postulated that}} extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) deposits are the fundamental {{cause of the}} disease. Support for this postulate comes from {{the location of the}} gene for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21, together with the fact that people with trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) who have an extra gene copy almost universally exhibit at least the earliest symptoms of AD by 40years of age. Also, a specific isoform of apolipoprotein, APOE4, is a major genetic risk factor for AD. While apolipoproteins enhance the breakdown of beta amyloid, some isoforms are not very effective at this task (such as APOE4), leading to excess amyloid buildup in the brain. Further evidence comes from <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> <b>that</b> transgenic mice that express a mutant form of the human APP gene develop fibrillar amyloid plaques and Alzheimer's-like brain pathology with spatial learning deficits.|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus piperatus was the {{original}} type species of the genus Lactarius. However, after <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> <b>that</b> Lactarius actually represented more than one genus, the species Lactarius torminosus was conserved as type for that genus. Thus, L. piperatus is now the type species of Lactifluus, which was split from Lactarius and contains mainly tropical milk-caps, but also some species of the north temperate zone. Phylogenetic research showed that L. glaucescens, sometimes considered only a variety of L. piperatus, is a distinct species in Europe. Furthermore, the existence of at least ten lineages worldwide, with no overlap among continents, was shown for the group around L. piperatus, suggesting that populations in North America might actually be distinct species.|$|E

A persistent view, based ultimately on the Pythagorean notion of harmony in music, holds that everything was arranged by Number, that God is the geometer of the world, and that therefore the world's geometry is sacred, as seen in artworks such as William Blake's The Ancient of Days.|$|E

5|$|Knowledge of Western Chalukya {{history has}} come through {{examination}} of the numerous Kannada language inscriptions left by the kings (scholars Sheldon Pollock and Jan Houben have claimed 90 percent of the Chalukyan royal inscriptions are in Kannada), and {{from the study of}} important contemporary literary documents in Western Chalukya literature such as Gada Yuddha (982) in Kannada by Ranna and Vikramankadeva Charitam (1120) in Sanskrit by Bilhana. The earliest record is dated 957, during the rule of Tailapa II when the Western Chalukyas were still a feudatory of the Rashtrakutas and Tailapa II governed from Tardavadi in present-day Bijapur district, Karnataka. The genealogy of the kings of this empire is still debated.

5|$|The {{field is}} characterised by some key concepts, which took {{biologists}} by surprise. One is deep homology, <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> <b>that</b> dissimilar organs {{such as the}} eyes of insects, vertebrates and cephalopod molluscs, long thought to have evolved separately, are controlled by similar genes such as pax-6, from the evo-devo gene toolkit. These genes are ancient, being highly conserved among phyla; they generate the patterns {{in time and space}} which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Another is that species do not differ much in their structural genes, such as those coding for enzymes; what does differ is the way that gene expression is regulated by the toolkit genes. These genes are reused, unchanged, many times {{in different parts of the}} embryo and at different stages of development, forming a complex cascade of control, switching other regulatory genes as well as structural genes on and off in a precise pattern. This multiple pleiotropic reuse explains why these genes are highly conserved, as any change would have many adverse consequences which natural selection would oppose.|$|E

40|$|Purpose This paper {{investigates the}} growth-corruption {{relationship}} {{in a sample}} of 146 countries for the period 1984 - 2009. While negative effects of corruption on growth have drawn economists’ interest in recent years, our main contribution is to examine the effects by employing the hierarchical polynomial regression to evaluate the relationship after controlling economic and institutional factors. Design/methodology/approach The results are estimated using panel generalized methods of moments. <b>Findings</b> <b>The</b> results challenge some of <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>that</b> negative growth-corruption association in the literature, but also provide some new inferences. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> reflect <b>that</b> corruption is not always growth-inhibitory, for some countries it is growth-enhancing which supports the “greasing-the-wheels” hypothesis. Originality/value The paper investigates the growth-corruption relationship using panel generalised methods of moments. Our results suggest that a cubic function best fitted <b>the</b> data. <b>The</b> <b>finding</b> suggests <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> medium corrupt countries corruption stimulates growth by reducing red-tape...|$|R
