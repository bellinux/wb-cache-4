40|$|Abstract — Upper {{and lower}} bounds are derived on <b>the</b> {{capacity}} and <b>fading</b> number of multi-antenna systems operating over flat <b>fading</b> channels. <b>The</b> <b>fading</b> process may exhibit memory, and the receiver {{is assumed to}} have access to some incomplete (possibly null) side information related to <b>the</b> <b>fading</b> realization.

40|$|The {{solution}} of space-fractional advection-dispersion equations (fADE) by random walks {{depends on the}} analogy between <b>the</b> <b>fADE</b> and <b>the</b> forward equation for the asso-ciated Markov process. The forward equation, which provides a Lagrangian description of particles moving under specific Markov processes, is derived here by the adjoint method. <b>The</b> <b>fADE,</b> however, provides an Eulerian description of solute fluxes. There are two forms of <b>the</b> <b>fADE,</b> based on fractional-flux (FF-ADE) and fractional divergence (FD-ADE). The FF-ADE is derived by taking the integer-order mass conservation of non-local diffusive flux, while the FD-ADE is derived by taking the fractional-order mass conservation of local diffusive flux. The analogy between <b>the</b> <b>fADE</b> and <b>the</b> for-ward equation depends on which form of <b>the</b> <b>fADE</b> is used and on the spatial variability of the dispersion coefficient D in <b>the</b> <b>fADE.</b> If D does not vary in space, then <b>the</b> <b>fADEs</b> can be solved by tracking particles following a Markov process with a simple drift and an α-stable Lévy noise with index α that corresponds to the fractional order of <b>the</b> <b>fADE.</b> If D varies smoothly in space and the solute concentration at the upstream boundary remains zero, the FD-ADE can be solved by simulating a Markov proces...|$|R

For example, when {{a part of the}} channel bandwidth fades, frequency interleaving ensures that the bit errors that would result from those subcarriers in <b>the</b> <b>faded</b> part of the bandwidth are spread out in the bit-stream rather than being concentrated. Similarly, time interleaving ensures that bits that are originally close together in the bit-stream are transmitted far apart in time, thus mitigating against severe fading as would happen when travelling at high speed.|$|E
