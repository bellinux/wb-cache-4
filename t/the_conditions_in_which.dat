5|$|A {{habitat is}} made up of {{physical}} factors such as soil, moisture, range of temperature, and light intensity as well as biotic factors such as the availability of food and {{the presence or absence of}} predators. Every organism has certain habitat needs for <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it will thrive, but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements. A habitat is not necessarily a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of moss, and for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host, part of the host's body such as the digestive tract, or a single cell within the host's body.|$|E
5|$|Most {{stars are}} {{observed}} {{to be members}} of binary star systems, and the properties of those binaries are the result of <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they formed. A gas cloud must lose its angular momentum in order to collapse and form a star. The fragmentation of the cloud into multiple stars distributes some of that angular momentum. The primordial binaries transfer some angular momentum by gravitational interactions during close encounters with other stars in young stellar clusters. These interactions tend to split apart more widely separated (soft) binaries while causing hard binaries to become more tightly bound. This produces the separation of binaries into their two observed populations distributions.|$|E

5|$|The Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company {{was one of}} {{the largest}} users of prison laborers, mostly Blacks convicted of petty crimes, as a method for paying fines. This {{practice}} was common for obtaining coal mining labor in Alabama {{at the close of the}} Reconstruction era. The number of convicts employed increased after U.S. Steel acquired TCI in 1907, as did the brutality of <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they labored. In 1908, the first full year of U. S. Steel's ownership of TCI, almost 60 prison workers died from workplace-related accidents. That same year, the new owners of the company discovered a 400% annual turnover in the workforce.|$|E
5|$|The {{major factors}} {{influencing}} diving safety are the environment, the diving {{equipment and the}} performance of the diver and the dive team. The underwater environment is alien, both physically and psychologically stressful, and usually not amenable to control, though divers can be selective in <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they are willing to dive. The other factors must be controlled to mitigate the overall stress on the diver and allow the dive to be completed in acceptable safety. The equipment is critical to diver safety for life support, but is generally reliable, controllable and predictable in its performance.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{presence}} of an embryo per se would be equivocal regarding this issue, <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the embryo were preserved provide strong evidence that Dinocephalosaurus was viviparous. There is no preserved calcified eggshell surrounding the embryo, despite {{the presence}} of delicately-preserved calcified elements from other animals at Luoping. This is consistent with the eggshells surrounding the embryos of viviparous reptiles being non-calcified membranes. Furthermore, the relative proportions of the humerus and the fibula in the embryo, compared with the maternal individual and IVPP V13898 from Panxian, indicate that the embryo is around 12% of the size of its mother. Combined with its ossified bones, this suggests that the embryo was at an advanced developmental stage, whereas crocodilians, birds, turtles, and tuataras lay eggs at very early developmental stages.|$|E
30|$|The {{alternative}} {{model for}} the development of vitamin B 12 deficiency contains only three stages: Normal; Depletion; Metabolic Deficiency (Fig.  5). The Normal stage is defined as <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> intake, and the internal processing, for an individual provides sufficient vitamin B 12 to sustain all of their metabolic requirements and maintain their body store of vitamin B 12. The Depletion stage, marked by the commencement of a long-term fall in serum total vitamin B 12 concentration, is defined as <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> intake, or the internal processing, for an individual does not provide sufficient vitamin B 12 to sustain all of their metabolic requirements, which are then maintained by depleting their body store of vitamin B 12. The Metabolic Deficiency stage, marked by the commencement of a fall in the HoloTC concentration and an increase in either MMA or tHcy or both metabolites, is defined as <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> depleted body store of vitamin B 12, or the internal processing, for an individual is insufficient to sustain all of their metabolic requirements.|$|R

5|$|Finally, in November 1945, Cariappa {{was made}} the {{commander}} of the Bannu Frontier Brigade in Waziristan. It was during this time that Colonel Ayub Khan – later Field Marshal and President of Pakistan (1962–1969) – served under him. Unlike previous British commanders who tried to keep the local tribes under control by force, Cariappa tried a different approach by extending them friendly relations which worked well. When Head of the Interim Government, Jawaharlal Nehru, visited Bannu he found it extremely peaceful and settled, compared to Razmak where another brigade was stationed. Nehru was impressed by Cariappa's way of dealing with the tribes. He was also widely acclaimed for his treatment of the Indian National Army's (INA) prisoners. When Cariappa visited one of the camps that held INA prisoners, he was moved by <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they lived. He immediately wrote to the Adjutant General recommending that their living conditions be improved and to pardon some of those who were not guilty. These included Colonel Prem Kumar Sahgal, Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon and Shah Nawaz Khan. Cariappa pointed out that these prisoners had considerable support from the Indian leaders, who would later rule the country. This led the British to release most of the prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{chapter on}} the {{distribution}} and growth of coral reefs examines <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they flourish, their rate of growth and the depths at which the reef building polyps can live, showing that they can only flourish at a very limited depth. In the fifth chapter he sets out his theory as a unified explanation for {{the findings of the}} previous chapters, overcoming the difficulties of treating the various kinds of reef as separate and the problem of reliance on the improbable assumption that underwater mountains just happened to be at the exact depth below sea level, by showing how barrier reefs and then atolls form as the land subsides, and fringing reefs are found along with evidence that the land is being elevated. This chapter ends with a summary of his theory illustrated with two woodcuts each showing two different stages of reef formation in relation to sea level.|$|E
5|$|The {{demands of}} combat during World War II led {{to changes in}} the {{composition}} of Army units. The success of German mechanised units during the invasions of Poland and France convinced Australian defence planners that the Army required armoured units, and these began to be raised in 1941 when the 1st Armoured Division was formed. The two Militia cavalry divisions were first motorised and then converted into armoured divisions in 1942 and the 3rd Army Tank Brigade was formed to provide support to the infantry. These large armoured units were not suitable for jungle warfare, however, and most were disbanded during 1943 and 1944. Conditions in the South West Pacific also led the Army to convert its six combat divisions to jungle divisions in early 1943 and 1944, reducing the authorised strength of the division by about 4,000 men. Each infantry battalion shed around 100 personnel as various support elements such as the anti-aircraft and carrier platoons were removed and consolidated at divisional level. The amount of heavy weapons and vehicles was also reduced, but the conditions that the organisation was designed for did not recur and it proved only moderately successful. As a result, the divisions were strengthened for their 1944–45 campaigns by returning the artillery and anti-tank units that had been removed. The creation of the jungle divisions represented {{the first time in the}} Australian Army's history that it had adopted an organisation specifically for <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> its forces would fight. Previously force structure had been heavily influenced by the British Army, and the decision to adopt an organisation to suit local conditions reflected a growing maturity and independence. Yet it also resulted in the adoption of a two-tier force structure, as formations that were not designated for jungle warfare remained on the previous scales of equipment and manning. Ultimately, while their structure was better suited to operations in Australia, they were no longer able to be used against the Japanese. As a result, the burden of the fighting increasingly fell on those formations that had been re-organised, while the remainder of the Army was relegated to garrison duties.|$|E
