In this paper, we present an iterative method for Keypoint Estimation and Pose prediction of unconstrained faces by Learning Efficient H-CNN Regressors (KEPLER) for addressing the face alignment problem. Recent state of the art methods have shown improvements in face keypoint detection by employing Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs). Although a simple feed forward neural network can learn the mapping between input and output spaces, it cannot learn the inherent structural dependencies. We present a novel architecture called H-CNN (Heatmap-CNN) which captures structured global and local features and thus favors accurate keypoint detecion. HCNN is jointly <b>trained</b> on the <b>visibility,</b> fiducials and 3 D-pose of the face. As the iterations proceed, the error decreases making the gradients small and thus requiring efficient training of DCNNs to mitigate this. KEPLER performs global corrections in pose and fiducials for the first four iterations followed by local corrections in the subsequent stage. As a by-product, KEPLER also provides 3 D pose (pitch, yaw and roll) of the face accurately. In this paper, we show that without using any 3 D information, KEPLER outperforms state of the art methods for alignment on challenging datasets such as AFW and AFLW.

40|$|Purpose. The most {{pressing}} problem facing the rail traffic safety experts is an accident rate at the railway level crossings. The {{purpose is to}} investigate the circumstances, which affect traffic safety at the level crossings, and to offer effective tools for experts to improve the safety the problems of these dangerous spaces of railway infrastructure. Methodology. This paper observes the logistic regression as a method to estimate the accident rate at level crossings in Lithuania. The authors have studied and evaluated the key factors affecting the safety of railway crossings. These factors are the intensity of trains and road transport means through the railway level crossing, the visibility of the approaching train {{from both sides of}} the traffic, the maximum permissible speed of the trains, the number of tracks (single track, double track, and multi-track), the level of installed alarm and automatic equipment, a density of population in this area, etc. Finally, only the factors, which might be described by mathematical expressions (numbers), were identified. Findings. By using logistic regression method, it was found that the most determinant factors at level crossings are the maximum speed of <b>trains,</b> poor <b>visibility</b> crossing (less than 1, 000 m), intensity of the road traffic at crossings, and inappropriate implementation of roads crossing the rails. Based on the study results, the conclusions and recommendations were formulated which primary measures to prevent accidents at level crossing and on what level crossing should be taken urgently. Originality. Revealed trends and major causes of accidents at railway crossings of Lithuania for 2004 - 2011 year. The necessity of implementation of progressive technical measures for the prevention accidents on railway level crossing is proved. Practical value. About 50 % of Lithuanian railway crossings do not meet the requirements of the level crossing legislation. This parameter is one of the key risk factors for traffic safety at level crossings. In order to eliminate the effect on accident due to poor <b>visibility</b> of moving <b>train,</b> it is proposed to use the "speed bumps". Question of the elimination of one level crossing is becoming more and more important due to the increased volume of traffic on the roads and railways, growing the speed of trains and the implementation of important large-scale road and rail projects...|$|R

This pre-FOT (Field Operational Test) in two major Dutch cities was started, while in sustainable urban mobility, cyclists and pedestrians can play a major role. Improved safety for these vulnerable road users is necessary to persuade {{large numbers of people}} to change their current daily way of commuting. In many European cities, infrastructure is not yet optimized towards traffic flow and safety, for large numbers of cyclists and pedestrians.

40|$|The {{following}} is a paper on the growing difficulty of retaining key-employees in the Yangtze delta region {{on the east coast}} of China. This report presents the findings from an in-depth analysis on human resource management and retention methods. It is carried out in the spring of 2008 on behalf of Laerdal Medical (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., a Norwegian company manufacturing medical training and therapy equipment. The intention is to provide advice for Laerdal Medical (Suzhou) co., Ltd on how to best retain key-employees. Laerdal Medical (Suzhou) Co., Ltd is a production facility fully owned by the Norwegian company Laerdal Medical AS. The facility manufactures medical training, educational and therapeutic equipment, such as a family of resuscitation training dolls and the first rigid extrication collar. The company’s general manager has up until now not had too many problems with retaining employees, but the increasing turnover rate in the area has made him want to be pre-emptive in order to keep turnover rates low in the company. After an introductory chapter where the current situation and the research aim are presented, followed by a presentation of the company and its situation, this paper will provide an extensive review of theories relating to human resource management and motivation. Furthermore, this paper will analyze the empirical findings and offer strategic solutions for Laerdal Medical (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. Methodology The authors of this paper had little prior knowledge about what western companies in China offer as incentives to their employees. Consequently there was a need for the authors to develop a deeper understanding of motivational tools and theories as well as factors for organisational commitment. Exploring published data (secondary data) would be insufficient. Therefore a qualitative research method was employed to gather primary information. The qualitative method was chosen as it provides the researcher with more insight than can be achieved though quantitative data alone. A qualitative method will additionally enable the collecting of in-depth information from managers and employees internally and externally. The purpose of the qualitative research was to develop a deeper understanding of what companies in the Yangtze delta region do to motivate and retain their employees. Additionally, identifying who companies define as their keyemployees was necessary. The qualitative method employed in this research was in depth interviews of general managers, HR managers and employees at various companies in various industries operating in Shanghai and Suzhou. In total 18 interviews were conducted, including one expert interview and seven internal interviews. All of the interviews were conducted face-to-face with the interviewee. Time and availability restrictions prevented more interviews. (Summaries of each interview can be found in chapter 5 of this report). Findings The findings from the collected data suggest that motivating and retaining employees is a fragmented and complicated task. Individuals are motivated through different needs and are not necessarily retained using the same tools. Most companies have an idea of who their key-employees are, but few seem to have implemented clear strategies for identifying them. One {{way to do this is}} to identify those employees whose absence would cause a breach in the production chain and cause general business to slow down or even stop. It is argued that heads of department and highly qualified technical personnel are the most valuable resources to a company and are their key-personnel. The increasing salary level in the Yangtze delta area has caused companies to focus on alternative strategies for retaining their key-personnel. The findings indicate that salary can only partially be seen as a motivational factor and that employees are less motivated by financial remuneration, than what much current media attention argues. It is possible that media attention has been onemployees in general and not specifically towards high level, highly educated personnel. The findings indicate that employees are more motivated by opportunities for personal development and having a positive work environment. Employees state that they want to know that they have a future in a company and that there are career opportunities for them. If this is in place, a significant increase in salary is needed to draw the personnel to another position elsewhere. The empirical data does not suggest what kind of training employees require, but the options range from basic computer and language training, to all expenses paid MBA programs. Those with extra skills should be offered extra <b>training.</b> <b>Visibility</b> in the market is said to be important for attracting new personnel. The research revealed that Laerdal Medical (Suzhou) Co., Ltd is a well known company in the region. Potential employees are generally drawn to European companies and Laerdal Medical (Suzhou) Co., Ltd attracts additional attention as a medical company. Keeping a high profile as an ethical company with clear visions and slogans seems to be something that attracts new candidates. The findings from the interviews conducted internally at Laerdal Medical (Suzhou) Co., Ltd, suggest that the company should focus more on involving employees in decisions that concerns their specific job areas. Internal interviews also revealed that most employees were satisfied with their current salary level, but that they could be making more. The company must keep a fair salary level compared with similar companies in the region, but should focus on other motivational tools to retain employees...|$|R

A qualitative, naturalistic inquiry design was used for this investigation. The investigation focused on the incumbent superintendent, the superintendent-elects, {{and the members of the}} Board of Education during the changes of chief executives for the Westside Community Schools between the years 1983 to 1992. ^ This investigation was designed to: (a) provide a history of the Westside Community Schools and its rise to prominence; (b) describe the conditions that existed and led to the change in superintendents; (c) describe the transition process and procedures that have been used by the Westside Community Schools; and (d) provide a detailed analysis of the transition process and identify critical events in this process. ^ The results of my investigation indicated that the transition of leadership from one superintendent to the next will be enhanced when the Board of Education recognizes its responsibility and role, and establishes a framework for the transition. Boards of Education seeking a smooth transition of leadership should consider the following: (a) agree on the need for a defined transition process which goes beyond the selection of a new superintendent; (b) obtain the full support of the outgoing superintendent for the transition process; (c) select a new superintendent well in advance of the departure of the current superintendent; (d) empower the outgoing superintendent with the prerogative to provide the superintendent-elect <b>training</b> and information, <b>visibility,</b> and authority to make decisions; (e) publicize the procedures and goals of the transition process to all stakeholders; and (f) monitor and evaluate the transition. ...|$|R
40|$|This Master’s Thesis {{describes}} the financial awareness amongst the onshore project teams in Pipeline & Process Services (PPS) Scandinavia, a Sub-Product Service Line (PSL) of Halliburton. Financial awareness {{is in this}} Thesis defined as knowledge of project revenue, cost and profit and the aspects that can affect these. This includes project management, contract formats, cost estimation, cost control, change management and cost drivers. The ongoing cost savings in the Norwegian petroleum industry have led to an increased focusand awareness of costs amongst {{the majority of the}} suppliers and subcontractors in the market. To be able to keep the position in the market and to have a profitable business Halliburton PPS Scandinavia is required to reduce project costs. To accomplish this it is important that all employees are aware of how they can contribute to increase revenue and reduce costs. The main goal of the Thesis is to identify suggestions for improvement and recommendations to increase the financial awareness amongst the project teams to reduce project costs in Halliburton PPS Scandinavia. To describe the financial awareness a survey has been distributed to the team members of four project teams inclusive of support personnel. Follow-up interviews have been performed with personnel assumed to be in key roles to obtain more information related to the topics of the survey as well as identifying suggestions for improvement to increase financial awareness and reduce project costs. In addition to this a Case Study of a project has been described to identify cost drivers and cost overrun by performing a financial analysis. From this, suggestions for improvement to reduce costs have been identified. The theory of the Thesis describes project management and financial aspects of a project based on existing literature and how this is applied in Halliburton PPS Scandinavia. This includes contract formats, estimating and budgeting, cost control, change management and project cost drivers. The literature has been used for analysis of the results from the survey and the interviews and will support the recommendations to Halliburton PPS Scandinavia. The Thesis concludes that the financial awareness amongst certain project team members should be increased to be able to reduce project costs, with knowledge, <b>training</b> and <b>visibility</b> being important factors to accomplish this. The Thesis Problem Statement has been answered by the recommendation of 37 suggestions for improvement based on the information about HalliburtonPPS, the theory, the Case Study, the results from the survey and the interviews, as well as the analysis. They have been critically evaluated based on the knowledge obtained through this study and are considered to be important to increase the financial awareness amongst the project teams to be able to reduce project costs in Halliburton Pipeline & Process Services Scandinavia. However, they should be verified by the PSL management prior to an implementation. Some of the recommendations will be easy to implement, while others may require more planning. One of the most important suggestions for improvement is to provide PSL specific financial training to technical personnel for them to understand how they can contribute to increase revenue and reduce costs. In addition to this a work method or a guideline for financial awareness should be created and made available to all employees through the Halliburton Management System. This document should present methods to increase revenue and reduce cost in all phases of a project, including what the different roles of a project team should be aware of, how they can contribute to reducing costs, as well as the typical cost drivers of a project. All of these suggestions for improvement will be important to increase the financial awareness amongst the project teams to be able to reduce project costs in Halliburton Pipeline & Process Services Scandinavia...|$|R
40|$|In 2012, world global {{production}} of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) {{was estimated at}} about 1. 3 billion tons per year and is predicted to grow to 2. 2 billion tons per year by 2025. Massive and fast accumulation of waste is difficult to handle especially in urban areas where space is scarce. Accumulation of waste results the development of harmful toxins, bacteria, and odors. Moreover, {{it can lead to}} soil and ground water contamination. These challenges are spread in Malawi where the field study took place. More precisely, the research was done in two cities; Lilongwe (the capital) and Blantyre (the commercial city). The overall aims of this paper are (i) to explore urban waste management strategies and market in Malawi (ii) to determine the actors and their role in urban waste market (iii) to understand the economic and social benefits of urban waste management. The study was conducted for two months. Thirteen interviews with different stakeholders in the waste management business were carried out. Three urban waste marketing activities were identified in the study areas namely; trade of compost produced from organic wastes, trade of plastic waste for industry and residential waste collect by small local companies. The compost market has a huge potential for development due to the large quantity of organic waste produced, minimum competition for organic wastes and the simplicity of the process (no need for high technology to compost waste). The existing waste activities generate job opportunities and improve the livelihood of urban dwellings. Both women and men are equally represented in the business; however, they do not work together and often don’t have the same tasks. For example women are cleaning the plastic waste while men are in charge of the collect and the process. However, the willingness of the government to promote private initiative regarding to waste management and marketing is very poor. All of the respondents identified lack of support from public authorities and regulations as a main challenge for waste management and marketing. Moreover, fuel price, lack of <b>training</b> and market <b>visibility</b> were the common impediments for the stakeholders Other results are found and are discussed all along the thesis. However these results must be carefully handled as the sample chose for the study is very small (13 interviews). Additionally, the respondents provided data that couldn’t be verified since it could be a personal choice by the respondents to overestimate their success or their issues, so there might be a bias towards quantitative as well as qualitative data. Finally, this study is a call for more research on the subject as waste trading seemed to have a great potential to answer poverty issue in urban Malawi. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} more specific research on the link between poverty alleviation and the mechanisms of the market especially in SSA countries...|$|R
40|$| the Recruitment of Researchers {{that aims}} at {{realising}} good working conditions for early stage researchers. The DK Programme actively supports female talent in science, {{this is done}} by a 30 % quota for females among faculty. From the data {{it became clear that}} among doctoral students nearly a balance in the participation of females and males has been achieved: on average about 46 % {{of the students in the}} DK were females. At the faculty level there was a growing awareness about the goal to increase the percentage of females among the faculty members. Unfortunately the goal has not been realized yet. Depending on the discipline it is hard to realize the integration of a sufficient number of females: in some disciplines there are only a few female professors, also a lack of excellent research among female faculty was mentioned here. Most of the speakers of DK tried to compensate the lack of female faculty by increasing the number of female doctoral students. This practice confronts the speakers of DK with new challenges: practices in achieving a more family friendly work environment are discussed, additionally it was mentioned that more family friendly regulations need to be developed. Universities’ views on the DK Programme In the view of the university managements the FWF Doctoral Programme is an excellence scheme, the DK are internally brand marked as excellent. This view is strongly supported by the quality assurance implemented by the FWF. Because of this excellence confirmed by the FWF allows researchers to request commitment by the university management in terms of additional funds and resources. In this respect the DK are sometimes evaluated as expensive. The kind and amount of support provided for the DK strongly depends on the university’s budget and the actors involved. While representatives of the university management strongly welcome the establishment of a DK as a means to strengthen the profile of their institution. The performance agreements between the universities and the federal government also explicitly consider the establishment of new and the continuation of existent DK. Impact of DK on doctoral <b>training</b> The <b>visibility</b> and the impact of a DK at universities depend to a large extent on the time it has been existing at its host institution. Generally, the majority of (guest) lectures and some other training events are open to all doctoral students at the host institution. Only a number of trainings that have in particular been designed for the DK (like hands on training in laboratories) are limited to the doctoral students of the DK. To what extent the doctoral training in the DK is different from doctoral training outside a DK is mainly dependent on the discipline and also the host institution. At some departments there is actually no difference between the both forms of training, here the DK mainly provide add-ons to doctoral training like the funding of a coordinator, international recruitment, travel costs, research stays abroad, the chance to invite international guest researchers or the funding of summer schools. There are also differences in the way doctoral training inside and outside the DK is organized. In particular in the Life Sciences structural forms of doctoral training are already common. Also in the Natural and Technical Sciences structural forms of doctoral training became more widespread (also depending on the faculty). In the Social Sciences and Humanities structural doctoral training only plays a minor role. In this disciplines the DK only function as a leverage to a very limited extent. This is also due to the fact that there are only a few DK established in these disciplines and that most of these are still young. Thus, doctoral training outside the DK is very different from training inside the DK for these disciplines, and the traditional master-apprenticeship is still prevalent here. In line with this the DK are regarded as highly specialised training centres that in particular prepare for an academic career in the Social Sciences and Humanities. The complementary role of the DK Programme In the recent years Austrian universities started own initiatives in structural doctoral training. These were mostly related to the developments on the European level, in particular the Bologna process. Also the implementation of the DK Programme has contributed to this development as it funds the implementation of structural elements in doctoral training. Besides this, there is a multitude of different initiatives to reform doctoral training in Austria. At the University of Vienna for example the so-called Initiativkollegs have been implemented. These are currently replaced by the Vienna Doctoral Academies and the funding of individual doctorates (uni:docs). At the University of Graz and Technical University of Graz Doctoral Schools have been implemented. Also at Medical Universities PhD programmes became more widespread as these institutions had to change their curricula in line with the Bologna reforms. Some Medical Universities also established doctoral schools, e. g. the Medical University of Graz. Here the guidelines of the FWF DK Programme served as a role model; also the quality assurance of the doctoral schools is organized by the FWF. Summarizing these developments there are a number of initiatives and reforms implemented at universities that build on the experiences that were made within the framework of the FWF DK Programme. For the funding of doctoral candidates a number of different models have been implemented: Some universities (University of Vienna, University of Salzburg, Veterinary University) fund positions for doctoral candidates, also as part-time employment. Other universities do not fund positions for doctoral candidates in the framework of their doctoral schools (e. g. University of Klagenfurt). Some universities also provide additional positions for doctoral candidates in the FWF DK (e. g. Medical University of Vienna), other prolong the funding of doctoral candidates for a limited period in case the funding for the FWF DK stops (e. g. University of Economics Vienna). In total all of these initiatives and activities have a common goal: they motivate to further proceed with the implementation of structural doctoral training and to increase the quality of doctoral studies in Austria. The increase in the quality of doctoral study should include a more sensitive usage of resources and synergies and the strategic linkage of those initiatives to the profile building of the universities. Also, a more tactical approach in the regulation of the so far open access to doctoral studies in Austria should be considered. Nonetheless, when considering further changes it should be clear that the resources of universities are limited, they cannot provide as many ressources as the FWF DK Programme and might in their initiatives not achieve a similar effect. In this respect it has to be stated that the FWF DK has a very important complementary role to the initiatives and activities implemented by universities. The university’s commitment Facing the increasing numbers of applications for the FWF DK Programme and the current budget constraints of the FWF it has to be investigated to what extent the universities will be able to increase their commitment towards the DK. In particular the question to what extent the universities can realistically contribute to the costs of a DK in order to decrease the funding provided by the FWF. Therefore in the evaluation different scenarios on the future funding of the DK have been discussed with the Principal Investigators of the DK and the managing board of universities (Rectors and Vice-Rectors). These discussions revealed that currently the universities will not be able to further contribute to the costs of the DK (besides their actual commitments). Also the fact that the FWF currently does not contribute to the overhead costs of large-scale research projects (and thus also not for the DK) needs to be considered here. Those scenarios that described a situation where the FWF would only provide initial funding or where universities would have to cover an increasing amount of the costs of the DK were rated as inpracticable or even as an illusion given the current tight budget of Austrian universities. Only very few Principal Investigators could image that the funding of the FWF would gradually decline. Summing up the statements of the representatives of universities it can be concluded that most universities already participate to the funding of DK to a large extent (provision of additional funds, additional positions for doctoral students, provision of research infrastructure, reduction of the teaching load for Principal Investigators). In the current situation an additional contribution to the DK was seen as a too big burden for the university’s budget. Conclusion The evaluation of the FWF DK Programme revealed that it is functioning very well. Researchers as well as the university management evaluate the programme as an excellence scheme. The programme achieved most of its goals (good performance in research, implementation of structural elements in doctoral training, internationalisation etc.). The programme also functions as a stimulus for the further reform and improvement of doctoral training in Austria. Here the programme serves as a role model and plays via funding an important complementary role. Nonetheless, experiences from other European countries point to an on-going further reform of doctoral training in the recent years. In particular in the Nordic countries (Denmark, Norway and Finland) the training component of doctoral training has become central. Also an increase in the number of doctoral graduates should be achieved in these countries. In line with these targets ministries have been changing the funding mechanism related to doctoral training, also universities have been assigned more responsibility in providing a high quality in (structural) doctoral training. In these countries doctoral training is to a large extent funded by the institutions, mostly by earmarked funds. These changes also led to change in the work of the research councils that had to reorient their funding schemes for doctoral candidates/young researchers. So far Austria has been using two different but complementary approaches in doctoral training: on the one hand doctoral training is funded by the global budget of the universities, on the other hand additional means (as the FWF DK Programme) are allocated by competitive means. Both funding mechanism have to be regarded as indispensable and contribute to maintain doctoral training in Austria. For the future the implementation of a unit cost funding model has been included in the intergovernmental agreement. This potential development might also affect the FWF DK Programme, therefore a need to reorient the programme might be considered. Until then the FWF DK Programme should be continued under the premise to fund excellent research and the most talented doctoral students...|$|R
