50|$|If <b>threads</b> <b>are</b> <b>cut</b> into a {{cylindrical}} rod, that {{minimum area}} {{occurs at the}} root of the thread. Often rods are upset (made thicker at the ends) so that the tie rod does not become weaker when <b>threads</b> <b>are</b> <b>cut</b> into it.|$|E
50|$|A {{threaded}} pipe has a screw thread at {{one or both}} ends for assembly. Steel pipe is often joined with threaded connections; tapered <b>threads</b> <b>are</b> <b>cut</b> into {{the end of the}} pipe, sealant is applied in the form of thread-sealing compound or thread seal tape (also known as PTFE or Teflon tape) and the pipe is threaded into a threaded fitting with a pipe wrench.|$|E
50|$|Hardanger {{embroidery}} uses satin stitch blocks {{known as}} Kloster blocks,consisting of 5 parallel satin stitches, worked over {{a group of}} 4 x 4 ground threads. These blocks enclose areas of fabric where a number of warp and weft <b>threads</b> <b>are</b> <b>cut</b> and withdrawn, leaving a network of loose threads and large holes within the shape defined by the Kloster blocks. Various decorative filling stitches are then worked over the remaining loose threads and holes to create a lacy effect.|$|E

25|$|Cutting {{a single}} helical groove into a screw-stock {{cylinder}} yields what {{is referred to}} as a single-thread screw. Similarly, one may construct a double-thread screw provided that the helix angle is the same, and a second <b>thread</b> <b>is</b> <b>cut</b> in the space between the grooves of the first. For certain applications, triple and quadruple <b>threads</b> <b>are</b> in use. The helix may <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> either right hand or left hand. In screws especially, the helix angle is essential for calculating torque in power screw applications.|$|R
50|$|Fibre fabrics are web-form fabric {{reinforcing}} material that has both {{warp and weft}} directions. Fibre mats are web-form non-woven mats of glass fibres. Mats are manufactured in cut dimensions with chopped fibres, or in continuous mats using continuous fibres. Chopped fibre glass is used in processes where lengths of glass <b>threads</b> <b>are</b> <b>cut</b> between 3 and 26 mm, threads are then used in plastics most commonly intended for moulding processes. Glass fibre short strands are short 0.2-0.3 mm strands of glass fibres {{that are used to}} reinforce thermoplastics most commonly for injection moulding.|$|E
40|$|Penile {{trauma is}} an {{uncommon}} but potentially serious injury presenting to pediatric emergency room. Strangulation injuries of the penis can be self-inflicted or occur accidentally. However, self-inflicted strangulation of the foreskin in children is rare. This {{is a case}} of 7 -year-old uncircumcised boy who himself tied foreskin of prepuce with a cotton <b>thread.</b> The <b>thread</b> <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> and circumcision performed to remove the damaged foreskin. </p...|$|R

50|$|English paper piecing is a hand-sewing {{technique}} used to maximize accuracy when piecing complex angles together. A paper shape <b>is</b> <b>cut</b> with the exact {{dimensions of the}} desired piece. Fabric is then basted to the paper shape. Adjacent units are then placed face to face, and the seam is whipstitched together. When a given piece is completely surrounded by all the adjacent shapes, the basting <b>thread</b> <b>is</b> <b>cut,</b> and the basting and the paper shape are removed.|$|R
60|$|They had {{occupation}} now {{in manufacturing}} {{a suit of}} clothes a-piece from the deer-skins. As the work required to be neater than that which sufficed for {{the making of the}} curtain, pointed sticks hardened in the fire were used for making the holes, and the thongs that served as <b>thread</b> <b>were</b> <b>cut</b> as finely as possible; this being done by the Indians, who turned them out no thicker than pack-thread.|$|R
50|$|Split {{tapestry}} weave - {{the simplest}} weave where two weft <b>threads</b> <b>are</b> woven up to adjacent warp threads and then reversed. The warp <b>threads</b> <b>are</b> then <b>cut</b> and retied {{to a different}} colour.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{different}} techniques exist. The {{most common}} is the simple interrupted stitch; {{it is indeed}} the simplest to perform and is called [...] "interrupted" [...] because the suture <b>thread</b> <b>is</b> <b>cut</b> between each individual stitch. The vertical and horizontal mattress stitch are also interrupted but are more complex and specialized for everting the skin and distributing tension. The running or continuous stitch is quicker but risks failing if the suture <b>is</b> <b>cut</b> in just one place; the continuous locking stitch {{is in some ways}} a more secure version. The chest drain stitch and corner stitch are variations of the horizontal mattress.|$|R
50|$|Its {{required}} for patients bleeding posteriorly into the throat.A postnasal pack is first prepared by tying three silk ties {{to a piece}} of gauze rolled into the shape of cone. A rubber catheter is passed through the nose and its end brought out from the mouth.Ends of the silk threads tied to it and catheter withdrawal from nose.Pack which follows the silk <b>thread,</b> <b>is</b> now guided into nasopharynx with the index finger. Anterior nasal cavity is now packed and silk thread tied over the dental roll.The third silk <b>thread</b> <b>is</b> <b>cut</b> shorts and allowed to hang in the oropharynx, it helps in easy removal of the pack later.Patient requires postnasal pack should always be hospitalized.|$|R
50|$|In use {{the blade}} is {{inserted}} into the seam underneath the <b>thread</b> to <b>be</b> <b>cut.</b> The <b>thread</b> <b>is</b> allowed to slip down into the fork and the tool is then lifted upwards allowing the blade {{to cut through the}} thread. Once the seam has been undone in this way the loose ends can be removed and the seam resewn.|$|R
50|$|Cutwork {{is related}} to drawn thread work. In drawn thread work, {{typically}} only the warp or weft <b>threads</b> <b>are</b> withdrawn (<b>cut</b> and removed), and the remaining threads in the resulting hole are bound in various ways. In other types of cutwork, both warp and weft <b>threads</b> may <b>be</b> drawn.|$|R
50|$|Steel pipe is {{sometimes}} joined using threaded connections, where tapered threads (see National Pipe <b>Thread)</b> <b>are</b> <b>cut</b> {{into the end}} of the tubing segment, sealant is applied in the form of thread sealing compound or thread seal tape (also known as PTFE or Teflon tape), and it <b>is</b> then <b>threaded</b> into a corresponding threaded fitting using two pipe wrenches. Beyond domestic or light commercial settings, steel pipe is often joined by welding, or by use of mechanical couplings made by companies such as Victaulic or Anvil International (formerly Grinnell) that hold the pipe joint together via a groove pressed or cut (a rarely used older practice), into the ends of the pipes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tower and}} sign {{industries}} commonly use slightly larger [...] "jumbo" [...] bars #14J and #18J as anchor rods for large structures. The bars are fabricated from slightly oversized blanks such that <b>threads</b> can <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> {{at the ends}} to accept standard 1.75" [...] (#14J) and 2.25" [...] (#18J) anchor nuts.|$|R
25|$|Threads {{of metal}} {{fasteners}} are usually created on a thread rolling machine. They may also <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> with a lathe, tap or die. Rolled <b>threads</b> <b>are</b> stronger than <b>cut</b> <b>threads,</b> with increases of 10% to 20% in tensile strength and possibly more in fatigue resistance and wear resistance.|$|R
40|$|Unusual {{chemical}} {{bonds are}} proposed. Each bond is almost covalent but {{is characterized by}} the thread of a small radius ∼ 0. 6 × 10 ^- 11 cm, between two nuclei in a molecule. The main electron density is concentrated outside the thread as in a covalent bond. The <b>thread</b> <b>is</b> formed by the electron wave function which has a tendency to be singular on it. The singularity along the <b>thread</b> <b>is</b> <b>cut</b> off by electron "vibrations" due to the interaction with zero point electromagnetic oscillations. The electron energy has its typical value of (1 - 10) eV. Due to the small tread radius the uncertainty of the electron momentum inside the <b>thread</b> <b>is</b> large resulting in a large electron kinetic energy ∼ 1 MeV. This energy is compensated by formation of a potential well due to the reduction of the energy of electromagnetic zero point oscillations. This is similar to formation of a negative van der Waals potential. <b>Thread</b> bonds <b>are</b> stable and cannot be created or destructed in chemical or optical processes...|$|R
500|$|Art {{directors}} Nilo Rodis and Dave Carson {{designed the}} Klingon Bird of Prey, while George constructed the model. Nimoy wanted {{the ship to}} be reminiscent of an attacking bird, with movable wings that changed {{depending on whether the}} ship was in a cruising or attack posture. George took design cues from sketches of bodybuilders and football players, incorporating the starship equivalents of down-stretched, threatening arms and muscular shoulders, together with what looked like shoulder pads and a chin guard on the ship's outstretched neck. Although the stolen Romulan ship <b>thread</b> <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> from the film, the Bird of Prey design had incorporated elements of Romulan design. [...] "It has some of the basic bird shape, but it's more ominous", Ralston said. A graphic bird design was integrated into the ship's underside.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{options are}} {{available}} with this technology. Bits may include a cutting device that removes the typical [...] "collar" [...] of plastified material that flows upwards, so that an even top surface is the result. Drilled starter holes {{may be used to}} reduce the required axial force and to leave a smooth finish in the bushing’s lower edge. Internal screw <b>threads</b> may <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> with taps or rolled with dies.|$|R
40|$|Two male brown potriges aged 8 - 12 {{months were}} brought to the outdoor clinic of the Department of Clinical Sciences, Gomal College of Veterinary Sciences, Gomal University, Dera Ismail Khan for the {{treatment}} of downward displacement of tongue in the oral cavity. On examination, the tongue alongwith laryngeal apparatus was found present in the lower pharyngeal region. Further examination revealed a tense thread like material transversing along the trachea/oesophagus. Palpation of the crop revealed the same thread like structure present not only in it but also extending on to the distal digestive tract. On the basis of the clinical assessment, a presumptive diagnosis of glossoptosis was made. On ingulviotomy, a <b>thread</b> <b>was</b> found passing from oesophagus through to the next chambers. The <b>thread</b> <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> as high as possible through the crop. The crop wound was closed by simple interrupted approximating sutures pattern, followed by a similar suturing of the skin. Daily antiseptic dressing was carried out by povidone-iodine application on cutaneous wound. The operated birds started taking the normal feed within a period of 12 - 24 hours. The skin stitches were removed after 7 days...|$|R
50|$|Another style {{shared with}} jeans and jeans cutoffs, but {{maybe even more}} popular in denim skirts, is the rough hem. This is {{achieved}} by not hemming the skirt (or undoing or cutting off the existing hem) and washing the skirt by machine several times. The resulting edge of the skirt will have a frayed or unraveling look, popular with teenagers and young women. The longer unraveled <b>threads</b> <b>are</b> usually <b>cut</b> off for an even fuzzy look, but some teenagers leave them hanging on their shorter skirts.|$|R
50|$|Gynefix is {{the only}} {{frameless}} IUD brand currently available. It consists of hollow copper tubes on a polypropylene <b>thread.</b> It <b>is</b> inserted through the cervix with a special applicator that sutures the thread to the fundus (top) of the uterus; the <b>thread</b> <b>is</b> then <b>cut</b> with a tail hanging outside of the cervix, similar to frame IUDs. When this tail is pulled, the suture comes undone and the device can be removed. This requires more force than removing a T-shaped IUD, but results in comparable discomfort during removal. Gynefix is not approved {{for use in the}} United States.|$|R
6000|$|Naturally Gilbert Campbell {{carried his}} tale of sorrow to the parish Minister. This did not avail him. His warp and <b>threads</b> <b>were</b> <b>cut</b> on his loom, {{and even the}} clothes of his family <b>were</b> <b>cut</b> while they <b>were</b> wearing them. At night {{something}} tugged the blankets off their beds, a favourite old spiritual trick, which was played, if I remember well, on a Roman Emperor, according to Suetonius. Poor Campbell had to remove his stock- in-trade, and send his children to board out, [...] "to try whom the trouble did most follow." [...] After this, all was quiet (as perhaps might be expected), and quiet all remained, till a son named Thomas was brought home again. Then the house was twice set on fire, and {{it might have been}} enough to give Thomas a beating. On the other hand, Campbell sent Thomas to stay with the Minister. But the troubles continued in the old way. At last the family became so accustomed to the Devil, [...] "that they were no more afraid to keep up the Clash" [...] (chatter) [...] "with the Foul Fiend than to speak to each other." [...] They were like the Wesleys, who were so familiar with the fiend Jeffrey, that haunted their home.|$|R
50|$|A screw is an {{inclined}} plane {{wrapped around a}} nail. Some screw <b>threads</b> <b>are</b> designed to mate with a complementary thread, known as a female thread (internal thread), often {{in the form of}} a nut or an object that has the internal thread formed into it. Other screw <b>threads</b> <b>are</b> designed to <b>cut</b> a helical groove in a softer material as the screw is inserted. The most common uses of screws are to hold objects together and to position objects.|$|R
50|$|In operation, {{there are}} usually four {{moveable}} chasers that cut the thread then {{back away from the}} work to permit rapid removal of the tool. The lower picture at the right shows four sets of chasers. Each set of chasers <b>is</b> designed to <b>cut</b> a different thread. One set of chasers would be used at a time, each chaser is inserted into the die head (in the correct order) and the die head is closed bringing the chasers down to their cutting position. When sufficient length of <b>thread</b> has <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> the die head will open allowing for rapid retraction of the head without interference with the newly formed thread.|$|R
30|$|Material and Methods: Physical {{examination}} of 38 year-old primigravid woman showed huge mobile tumor {{located in the}} right upper region of abdomen. A sonographic scan showed the presence of 10 weeks intrauterine pregnancy and two subserous fibroids measuring 12 and 6 cm. Having used Hasson’s technic the first umbilical trocar was inserted. Pedicles of myomas were strangled with two surgical vicryl <b>threads.</b> Afterwards fibroids <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> off by scissors and removed by morcellation.|$|R
50|$|ISO 1502 sets a {{standard}} for threads and gauging to test them. It establishes the attribute T as go for the major diameter and the attribute Z as no-go for the pitch diameter. The inspection tool has two threaded components. For example, there would be two female sections on a gauge to test a threaded male workpiece such as a screw. If the major diameter of a screw is too large, it will not fit in the T test thread at all (fail). If the major diameter is too small, the fit is sloppy (fail). If the <b>thread</b> has <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> too deep, it screws into the Z test thread (fail). If the fit is right and only does about three turns, the fit is right (pass).|$|R
50|$|With soft or average {{hardness}} materials, such as plastic, aluminum or mild steel, {{the common}} practice {{is to use}} an intermediate (plug) tap to cut the threads. If the <b>threads</b> <b>are</b> to extend {{to the bottom of}} a blind hole, the intermediate (plug) tap will <b>be</b> used to <b>cut</b> <b>threads</b> until the point of the tap reaches bottom, after which a bottoming tap will be used to finish the hole. Frequent ejection of the chips must be made in such an operation to avoid jamming and possibly breaking the tap. With hard materials, the machinist may start with a taper tap, whose less severe diameter transition reduces the amount of torque required to cut the <b>threads.</b> If <b>threads</b> <b>are</b> to <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> to the bottom of a blind hole, the taper tap will be followed by an intermediate (plug) tap and then a bottoming tap to finish the operation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take from me my sin like a fetter, and {{we shall}} increase, O Varuna, the spring of thy law. Let not the <b>thread</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> while I weave my song!

Move far away from me all self-committed guilt, and may I not, O king, suffer for what others have committed. Many dawns have not yet dawned; grant me to live in them, O Varuna." [...] What follows is not on the same level of thought, and the next verse contains an appeal to Varuna to save his worshipper from the effect of magic spells. [...] "Whether it be my companion or a friend who, while I was asleep and trembling, uttered fearful spells against me, whether it be a thief or a wolf who wishes to hurt me, protect us against them, O Varuna."* Agni, again, the god of fire, seems to have no original connection with righteousness. Yet even Agni** is prayed to forgive whatever sin the worshipper may have committed through folly, and to make him guiltless towards Aditi.*** The goddess Aditi once more, whether her name (rendered the [...] "boundless") be or be not [...] "one of the oldest names of the dawn,"**** is repeatedly called on by her worshippers to [...] "make them sinless". In the same way sun, dawn, heaven, soma, and earth are implored to pardon sin.|$|R
50|$|Manually {{controlled}} metalworking lathes {{are commonly}} {{provided with a}} variable-ratio gear-train to drive the main lead-screw. This enables different <b>thread</b> pitches to <b>be</b> <b>cut.</b> On some older lathes or more affordable new lathes, the gear trains are changed by swapping gears with various numbers of teeth onto or off of the shafts, while more modern or expensive manually controlled lathes have a quick-change box to provide commonly used ratios by the operation of a lever. CNC lathes use computers and servomechanisms to regulate the rates of movement.|$|R

"Zadok," [...] {{said the}} Wise Man, [...] "give me {{the staff of}} life and death;" [...] and the Demon brought from under his clothes a wand, {{one-half}} of which was of silver and one-half of which was of gold. The Wise Man touched {{the steps of the}} palace with the silver end of the staff. Instantly all the sound and hum of life <b>was</b> hushed. The <b>thread</b> of life <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> by the knife of silence, and in a moment all was as still as death.|$|R
50|$|To cast on, the yarn is {{put through}} the hole in the lucet from the front, and the yarn in front of the lucet is wound around the prongs twice in a figure-of-eight. The two lower loops are then lifted over the two upper loops using either the fingers or a stick until they come over the horns, and the thread behind the lucet is pulled to tighten the knot. The process is then repeated, but this time only winding the yarn once around the prongs, as there is already a figure-of-eight on the fork. When the desired length is reached, the lucet can be cast off by {{carefully}} lifting the loops off the prongs, passing the remaining thread through them and pulling the knot tight. Any loose <b>thread</b> can <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> off with scissors or tied together to form a closed circle. The cord can be wrapped around the lucet handle as it grows.|$|R
50|$|Screw clamps {{consist of}} a {{galvanized}} or stainless steel band into which a screw <b>thread</b> pattern has <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> or pressed. One end of the band contains a captive screw. The clamp is put around the hose or tube to be connected, with the loose end being fed into a narrow space between the band and the captive screw. When the screw is turned, it acts as a worm drive pulling the threads of the band, causing the band to tighten around the hose (or when screwed the opposite direction, to loosen). Screw clamps are normally used for hoses 1/2 inch diameter and up, with other clamps used for smaller hoses.|$|R
