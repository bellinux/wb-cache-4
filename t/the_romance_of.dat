5000|$|The work uses {{a simple}} Kannada style and {{describes}} <b>the</b> <b>romances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three pairs {{that appear in}} <b>the</b> story. <b>The</b> <b>romances</b> <b>of</b> Krishna and his consort Rukmini is treated in first four Sandhis, the Kama and Rathi romance in next twelve sandhis and that of Anirudha and Ushe in final 26 Sandhis. Though a kavya written in the classical style, with the conventional eighteen descriptions, the work delves into aspects of eroticism in its treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>romances.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although he venerated Scott's {{writing skill}} {{and use of}} history as backdrop, Balzac worked to more {{accurately}} depict the turbulence {{of the human heart}} – and its effect on history. He considered Scott's view of women unrefined, and believed this led to a stale representation of human behavior as a result. In Les Chouans, Balzac places <b>the</b> <b>romance</b> <b>of</b> Montauran and Marie de Verneuil {{at the center of the}} narrative, around which all other elements revolve.|$|E
5|$|If {{ever there}} was a book {{calculated}} to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, {{at the same time that}} she displays a genius which commands all our admiration. Affliction had tempered her heart to a softness almost more than human; and the gentleness of her spirit seems precisely to accord with all <b>the</b> <b>romance</b> <b>of</b> unbounded attachment.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, García Márquez {{published}} the memoir Vivir para contarla, {{the first of}} a projected three-volume autobiography. Edith Grossman's English translation, Living to Tell the Tale, was published in November 2003. October 2004 brought the publication of a novel, Memories of My Melancholy Whores (Memoria de mis putas tristes), a love story that follows <b>the</b> <b>romance</b> <b>of</b> a 90-year-old man and a pubescent concubine. Memories of My Melancholy Whores caused controversy in Iran, where it was banned after an initial 5,000 copies were printed and sold.|$|E

5|$|Romeo and Juliet is {{sometimes}} {{considered to have}} no unifying theme, save that of young love. Romeo and Juliet have become emblematic of young lovers and doomed love. Since it is such an obvious subject of the play, several scholars have explored the language and historical context behind <b>the</b> <b>romance</b> <b>of</b> the play.|$|E
5|$|Several of {{the actors}} were {{specialised}} comedians, notably Joseph Haines who played the false-wit character Sparkish, Alithea's original fiancé. At the outset of his high-profile career as comedian and song-and-dance man, young Haines already {{had a reputation for}} eccentricity and dominant stage presence, suggesting that Sparkish is not merely a comic butt for the truewits Horner, Harcourt, and Dorilant to mock, but also a real threat to <b>the</b> <b>romance</b> <b>of</b> Harcourt and Alithea.|$|E
5|$|In 1902 Bondfield met Mary Macarthur, some {{eight years}} her junior, {{who chaired the}} Ayr branch of NAUSAWC. Macarthur, the {{daughter}} of a wealthy Scottish draper, had held staunchly Conservative views until a works meeting in 1901 to discuss the formation of a NAUSAWC branch transformed her into an ardent trades unionist. In 1903 Macarthur moved to London where, with Bondfield's recommendation, she became secretary of the Women's Trade Union League. The two became close comrades-in-arms during the next two decades, in a range of causes affecting women. The historian Lise Sanders suggests that Bondfield's more intimate friendships tended to be with women rather than men; Bondfield's biographer Mary Hamilton described Macarthur as <b>the</b> <b>romance</b> <b>of</b> Bondfield's life.|$|E

5|$|No more of {{the tale}} is {{recorded}} until about 1165 when copies of what was certainly a forged Letter of Prester John started spreading throughout Europe. An epistolary wonder tale with parallels suggesting its author knew <b>the</b> <b>Romance</b> <b>of</b> Alexander and the above-mentioned Acts of Thomas, the Letter was supposedly written to the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Comnenus (1143–1180) by Prester John, descendant {{of one of the}} Three Magi and King of India. The many marvels of richness and magic it contained captured the imagination of Europeans, and it was translated into numerous languages, including Hebrew. It circulated in ever more embellished form for centuries in manuscripts, a hundred examples of which still exist. The invention of printing perpetuated the letter's popularity in printed form; it was still current in popular culture during the period of European exploration. Part of the letter's essence was that a lost kingdom of Nestorian Christians still existed in the vastnesses of Central Asia.|$|E
