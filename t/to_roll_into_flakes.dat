5000|$|Soybean seed {{contains}} 18-19% oil. To extract {{soybean oil}} from seed, the soybeans are cracked, adjusted for moisture content, <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> <b>flakes</b> and solvent-extracted with commercial hexane. The oil is then refined, blended for different applications, and sometimes hydrogenated. Soybean oils, both liquid and partially hydrogenated, are exported abroad, sold as [...] "vegetable oil", or {{end up in}} a wide variety of processed foods.|$|R
50|$|Rye flakes {{are made}} from rye groats which are steamed and <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> a <b>flake.</b> They may be added to soups, stews, cakes and breads.|$|R
50|$|Rolled oats are {{traditionally}} oat groats {{that have been}} dehusked and steamed, before being <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> flat <b>flakes</b> under heavy rollers and stabilized by being lightly toasted.|$|R
5000|$|To produce soybean oil, the {{soybeans}} are cracked, {{adjusted for}} moisture content, heated to between 60 and 88 °C (140-190 °F), <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> <b>flakes,</b> and solvent-extracted with hexanes. The oil is then refined, blended for different applications, and sometimes hydrogenated. Soybean oils, both liquid and partially hydrogenated are sold as [...] "vegetable oil," [...] or are {{ingredients in a}} wide variety of processed foods. Most of the remaining residue (soybean meal) is used as animal feed.|$|R
50|$|Flaked barley is unmalted, dried barley <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> flat <b>flakes.</b> It imparts a rich, grainy {{flavor to}} beer {{and is used}} in many stouts, {{especially}} Guinness stout; it also improves head formation and retention.|$|R
5000|$|Oats for {{porridge}} may be whole (groats), {{cut into}} {{two or three}} pieces (called [...] "pinhead", [...] "steel-cut" [...] or [...] "coarse" [...] oatmeal), ground into medium or fine oatmeal, or steamed and <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> <b>flakes</b> of varying sizes and thicknesses (called [...] "rolled oats", the largest size being [...] "jumbo"). The larger the pieces of oat used, the more textured the resulting porridge. It is said that, because of their size and shape, the body breaks steel-cut oats down more slowly than rolled oats, reducing spikes in blood sugar and making the eater feel full longer. The US Consumer Reports Web site found that the more cooking required, the stronger the oat flavor and the less mushy the texture.|$|R

50|$|The {{central focus}} of the series is upon a group of malevolent {{carnivorous}} alien creatures called Krites which are known as Critters.

50|$|Often, if an {{airplane}} in a slip {{is made to}} stall, it displays {{very little of the}} yawing tendency that causes a skidding stall to develop into a spin. A stalling airplane in a slip may do little more than tend <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>into</b> a wings-level attitude. In fact, in some airplanes stall characteristics may even be improved.|$|R
50|$|Panic mounted and {{observers}} overhead {{watched in horror}} as survivors plodded south suffering terrible heat and thirst. Communist forces finally cut the road just south of Tuy Hoa on 22 March. Desperate attacks by Vietnamese Rangers eventually reopened the way, and, during the evening of 27 March, the first vehicles began <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>into</b> Tuy Hoa.|$|R
50|$|Through {{the mid-1980s}} Esber {{increasingly}} looked to diversify the company's holdings, and purchased {{a number of}} products <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>into</b> the Ashton-Tate lineup. By and large most of these acquisitions failed and {{did not result in}} the revenue expected. This experience is another illustration of the difficulty of integrating acquired companies and products in a rapidly changing technological market.|$|R
5000|$|Donovan Curtis thinks he's ungifted. He is the {{ultimate}} prankster and trouble-maker. But one day, he goes too far in causing a commotion.

50|$|Another {{standard}} escape {{involves the}} mounted opponent touching {{his head to}} the ground to temporarily prevent against a choke while also attempting <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>into</b> the dominant opponent's guard. Alternatively, while basing with the head on the ground, the mounted opponent can use his/her legs or arms to remove one of the hooks to make rolling into the guard easier.|$|R
50|$|The fair catch signal {{can be used}} as a {{legal form}} of deception: If the {{receiver}} has no intention of actually fielding the ball, but wishes it <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>into</b> the end zone for a touchback, he may signal for a fair catch in front of where the ball will land, making the kicking team think it will not reach the end zone.|$|R
50|$|When threatened, {{armadillos}} run to {{the nearest}} burrow or crevice and tightly wedge themselves inside with their back alongside the wall. If no such burrow or shelter is available, armadillos curl up {{in order to protect}} their vulnerable underside. Dasypus species are unable <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>into</b> a complete ball like the Brazilian three-banded armadillo due their excessive number of dermal plates.|$|R
5000|$|Riding {{the clutch}} {{should not be}} {{confused}} with [...] "freewheeling" [...] or [...] "coasting", where the clutch is pressed down fully allowing the car <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> either downhill or from inertia. While this is not damaging to the car, it can be considered a dangerous way to drive since one forgoes the ability to quickly accelerate if needed. It is, however, a common practice <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>into</b> a parking space or over speed bumps via inertia.|$|R

50|$|The method {{involves}} {{taking a}} small sample of soil, sufficient <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>into</b> a ball of approx 2.5 cm diameter, from just below the surface. Using a small drop of water or 'spit' the sample is then moistened to the sticky point (the point at which it begins to adhere to the finger).

5000|$|All chitons bear a {{protective}} dorsal shell that {{is divided into}} eight articulating aragonite valves embedded in the tough muscular girdle that surrounds the chiton's body.

In some species the valves are reduced or covered by the girdle tissue. the valves are variously colored, patterned, smooth, or sculptured.|$|R
