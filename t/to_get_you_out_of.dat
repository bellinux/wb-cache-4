2500|$|In {{the final}} minutes of the game, with the Terps {{trailing}} the Cavaliers 24–17, Maryland quarterback Neil O'Donnell was injured and {{taken out of the}} game. He was replaced by a young second-stringer Scott Zolak. Zolak led a drive which culminated with a three-yard option run for a touchdown narrowing the deficit to a point. With 1:09 left in the game, Maryland went for two. Zolak threw into the endzone to running back Ricky Johnson. Johnson appeared to catch the ball before being hit by defensive back Keith McMeans, knocking the ball loose. An official in the endzone immediately signaled for a catch, before others waved it as incomplete. After the game, the usually level-headed Terps head coach Joe Krivak ran to the official who made the initial call, following him to the locker room, and then ran over to yell at referee Don Safrit. Several witnesses claim he said to the officials that [...] "If it takes every ounce of energy, I'm going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this league." [...] Virginia (7–4) broke their 16-game losing streak in the series and finished second in the conference. Maryland (5–6) failed to achieve a winning season for the third consecutive year. However, the Cavaliers failed to secure a bowl game berth, while N.C. State with a worse record went on to the Peach Bowl.|$|E
2500|$|The Boston Globe writer Scott McLennan {{called the}} band [...] "relentless" [...] in his {{favorable}} review. He {{went on to}} explain that, [...] "New Found Glory flaunts the chemistry brewed over the 14 years that these five Floridians have been together. Guitarists Chad Gilbert and Steve Klein maneuver speedy melodies around singer Jordan Pundik's tales of love and loss, while drummer Cyrus Bolooki and bassist Ian Grushka propel the band. New Found Glory is at its best when sounding highly caffeinated, even if breakneck tempos belie a song's blue mood." [...] Vanessa Spates of daily newspaper The Lantern awarded Radiosurgery an [...] "A" [...] grade in her review. She wrote that [...] "Seven studio albums is an impressive feat for a punk rock band in a post-rock era. They keep a youthful quality in the manic guitars and the fury of drums. The entire album is infectious and invokes a lot of heartbreak anthems that everyone can relate to." [...] Roz Smith, writing for New Jersey tabloid The Aquarian Weekly, felt the album was undeniably [...] "catchy", emphasizing its [...] "choruses, upbeat guitar riffs, bass grooves and slamming drums." [...] Nicole Villeneuve of Candadian magazine Exclaim! also offered a positive review and wrote how the album was full of [...] "lively hooks and crisp songs in a taut pop-punk package." [...] Chad Grischow of IGN scored the album at 8.5 out of 10 and called it a [...] "vibrant, infinitely listenable treat." [...] He {{went on to explain}} that, [...] "Channeling the brand of freewheeling, fun-loving pop-punk the quintet burst onto the scene playing years ago, the lean, in-your-face set of tracks examining a crumbled relationship hits hard." [...] Rock Sound journalist Terry Bezer explained how there [...] "isn't a wasted minute on Radiosurgey", whilst awarding a near perfect 9 out of 10 score. He noted how the album [...] "will delight pop-punk purists and NFG faithful alike", before praising the songwriting as some of the band's most infectious to-date. Steve M, staff writer for Sputnikmusic awarded Radiosurgery a [...] "great" [...] 3.5 out of 5 score. He felt the album contained [...] "all the little quirks of their earlier material," [...] before adding, [...] "it is difficult not {{to get caught up in}} Radiosurgery for what it is: a short and sweet pop-punk album designed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> your chair and moving." [...] Consequence of Sound writer Kevin Barber awarded the album three stars out of five in his review. He wrote that, [...] "On Radiosurgery, New Found Glory have found their older, faster, and stronger sound, dishing out anthemic choruses, while still holding on to their [...] "" [...] maturity." [...] Jason Heller of The A.V. Club was less receptive, awarding the album a [...] "C" [...] grade and bemoaning the bands, [...] "same bouncy/bittersweet dynamic. It's also stuck religiously to its chunky, melodic sound. But where 2009's Not Without A Fight had a hint of a bite, Radiosurgery shows all the signs of tooth decay." ...|$|E
