500|$|They {{reached the}} edge of a wood, close to the Temple de l'Amour, and came across a man seated beside a garden kiosk, wearing a cloak and large shady hat. According to Moberly, his {{appearance}} was [...] "most repulsive... its expression odious. His complexion was dark and rough." [...] Jourdain noted [...] "The man slowly <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> which was marked by smallpox; his complexion was very dark. The expression was evil and yet unseeing, and though I did not feel that he was looking particularly at us, I felt a repugnance to going past him. A man later described as [...] "tall... with large dark eyes, and crisp curling black hair under a large sombrero hat" [...] came up to them, and showed them the way to the Petit Trianon.|$|E
500|$|Don Davis {{was cast}} as Agent Scully's father {{and was one}} of several Twin Peaks actors to appear in the series. Davis {{returned}} as William Scully in [...] "One Breath" [...] (season 2). Sheila Larken, who played Scully's mother, Margaret, is the wife of the show's co-executive producer R.W. Goodwin. Larken returned for a further 15 episodes in the role. Morgan and Wong fought hard to have veteran film actor Brad Dourif play the role of Luther Lee Boggs against concerns about the cost of hiring him. X-Files creator Chris Carter called the president of Twentieth Century Fox, Peter Roth, during thanksgiving dinner and convinced him to let them cast Dourif for the part. Dourif was asked to appear in the episode with only four days of preparation. He originally refused the part, until the producers gave him an extra week to prepare. [...] While getting into character between takes, his deep breathing exercises <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> bright purple.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Hisda praised Rabbi Hamnuna before Rabbi Huna {{as a great}} man. He said to him, 'When {{he visits}} you, bring him to me. When he arrived, he saw that he wore no head-covering. 'Why do you not have head-covering?' he asked. 'Because I am not married,' was the reply. Thereupon, he [...] <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> {{away from him and}} said, 'See to it that you do not appear before me again before you are married.' ...|$|E

2500|$|Allah's Apostle said, [...] "It is not lawful {{for a man}} {{to desert}} his brother Muslim for more than three nights. (It is {{unlawful}} for either that) when they meet, one should <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> away from the other, and the other <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> from the former; and the best of them is the one who first offers the salutation [...]" ...|$|R

2500|$|Muhammad bin Seereen said: [...] "When Muawiyah was on {{the brink}} of death, he began to mark out the floor. Then he <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> and marked out another spot on the floor, after which he started to cry and say: [...] "O Allah! Indeed, You said in Your Book [...] "Verily, Allah forgives not that {{partners}} should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives everything else to whom He wills" [...] Therefore, O Allah, make me amongst those You will forgive".|$|E
2500|$|Rav Bardela bar Tabyumi {{taught in}} Rav's name that to whomever [...] "hiding of the face" [...] {{does not apply}} {{is not one of}} the Children of Israel, and to whomever [...] "they shall be devoured" [...] does not apply is also not one of them. The Rabbis confronted Rava, saying [...] "hiding of the face" [...] and [...] "they shall be devoured" [...] did not apply to Rava. Rava asked the Rabbis whether they knew how much he was forced to send {{secretly}} to the Court of King Shapur of Persia. Even so, the Rabbis directed their eyes upon Rava in suspicion. Meanwhile, the Court of King Shapur sent men who seized Rava's property. Rava then said that this bore out what Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel taught, that wherever the Rabbis direct their eyes in suspicion, either death or poverty follows. Interpreting [...] "I will hide My face," [...] Rava taught that God said although God would hide God's face from them, God would nonetheless speak to them in a dream. Rav Joseph taught that God's hand is nonetheless stretched over us to protect us, as [...] says, [...] "And I have covered you in the shadow of My hand." [...] Rabbi Joshua ben Hanania was once at the Roman emperor Hadrian's court, when an unbeliever gestured to Rabbi Joshua in sign language that the Jewish people was a people from whom their God had <b>turned</b> <b>His</b> <b>face.</b> Rabbi Joshua ben Hanania gestured in reply that God's hand was stretched over the Jewish people. Emperor Hadrian asked Rabbi Joshua what unbeliever had said. Rabbi Joshua told the emperor what unbeliever had said and what Rabbi Joshua had replied. They then asked the unbeliever what he had said, and he told them. And then they asked what Rabbi Joshua had replied, and the unbeliever did not know. They decreed that a man who does not understand what he is being shown by gesture should hold converse in signs before the emperor, and they led him forth and executed him for his disrespect to the emperor.|$|E
