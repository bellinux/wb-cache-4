5|$|He {{showed that}} {{coloured}} light {{does not change}} its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. <b>Thus,</b> <b>he</b> observed that colour {{is the result of}} objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus doubles {{this number}} {{to account for}} support {{personnel}} and <b>thus</b> <b>he</b> reports that the whole army numbered 5,283,220 men. Other ancient sources give similarly large numbers. The poet Simonides, who was a near-contemporary, talks of four million; Ctesias gave 800,000 as {{the total number of}} the army that assembled in Doriskos.|$|E

5|$|In Gideon v. Wainwright, Justice Harlan {{agreed that}} the Constitution {{required}} states to provide attorneys for defendants who could not afford their own counsel. However, he believed that this requirement applied only at trial, and not on appeal; <b>thus,</b> <b>he</b> dissented from Douglas v. California.|$|E
5|$|Macbeth {{eventually}} {{sees that}} Banquo {{can no longer}} be trusted to aid him in his evil, and considers his friend a threat to his newly acquired throne. <b>Thus</b> <b>he</b> has him murdered. Banquo's ability to live on in different ways is another oppositional force, in this case to Macbeth's impending death. His spirit lives on in Fleance, his son, and in his ghostly presence at the banquet.|$|E
5|$|On October 23, 2017, the GFW {{name was}} dropped {{and the company}} name was reverted back to Impact Wrestling when the company severed ties with Jeff Jarrett and <b>thus</b> <b>he</b> took the GFW name with him. Impact Wrestling however kept the Global Championship name for their {{championship}} and the title is now called the Impact Global Championship.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} Severianus is {{fixed to the}} city of Lemonum (modern Poitiers) in the area {{inhabited}} by the Pictones, since the discovery from that city of an inscription concerning Severianus. <b>Thus</b> <b>he's</b> also found briefly mentioned by Lucian of Samosata who remembered his Gallic origins.|$|R

5000|$|According to an {{inscription}} asserted to him, Ben-Azen had came to Ancient Egypt from Northern Jordan, <b>thus</b> <b>he's</b> {{to be referred}} to as Canaanite in terms of ethnic background. Like many [...] "butlers" [...] (a term coined to the officials of foreign descent) in the Ramesside era, Ben Azen reflects the Asiatic tone the Royal Court had.|$|R
5|$|White was the {{grandson}} of Virginia pioneer settler and physician Dr. Robert White (1688–1752); <b>thus,</b> <b>he</b> {{was a member of}} the prominent White political family of Virginia and West Virginia.

5|$|White {{was the son}} of Virginia pioneer settler and {{physician}} Dr. Robert White (1688–1752); <b>thus,</b> <b>he</b> {{was a member of the}} prominent White political family of Virginia and West Virginia.

5|$|Zisman {{observed}} that cos θ increases linearly as the surface tension (γLV) {{of the liquid}} decreased. <b>Thus,</b> <b>he</b> was able to establish a linear function between cos θ and the surface tension (γLV) for various organic liquids.|$|E
60|$|<b>Thus</b> speaking, <b>he</b> {{struck his}} horse with the spurs, and rode on his way.|$|R
60|$|While <b>he</b> <b>thus</b> spoke, <b>he</b> {{alternately}} urged and restrained his horse, desirous {{to maintain}} the fleetest pace that {{was consistent with the}} idea of an ordinary journey on the road, but to avoid such rapidity of movement as might give rise to suspicion that they were flying.|$|R
6000|$|While <b>he</b> <b>thus</b> spoke, <b>he</b> kept fumbling to {{open the}} postern of which he spoke, until the King said, [...] "Forbear, old man--forbear but a little while, when thou mayst have a newer tale to tell, and fresher blood to show.--My Lord of Crevecoeur, what say you?" ...|$|R
5|$|A wealthy {{resident}} of al-Rahba, Ibn Mahkan, revolted against the Fatimids and {{took control of}} the town shortly after Lu'lu departed. Though able to oust the Fatimid governor, Ibn Mahkan was unable to hold the town without outside support since al-Rahba was located amid the crossroads of several regional powers who coveted the town. <b>Thus,</b> <b>he</b> gained the backing of the Mirdasid emir of the Banu Kilab tribe, Salih ibn Mirdas. Conflict arose between Ibn Mahkan and Salih leading the latter to besiege al-Rahba. The two reconciled and then Ibn Mahkan and his men captured the fortified town of Anah in Anbar. However, when Ibn Mahkan sought Salih's support in suppressing a revolt in Anah, the latter used the opportunity to kill Ibn Mahkan.|$|E
5|$|Ai {{initially}} {{refuses to}} see a connection between his sexuality and his mode of consciousness, preventing him from truly understanding the Gethenians; <b>thus</b> <b>he</b> is unable to persuade them {{of the importance of}} his mission. Ai's failure to comprehend shifgrethor and to trust Estraven's motives leads him to misunderstand much of the advice that Estraven gives him. As Ai's relationship to Estraven changes, their communication also changes; they are both more willing to acknowledge mistakes, and make fewer assertions. Eventually, the two are able to converse directly with mindspeech, but only after Ai is able to understand Estraven's motivations, and no longer requires direct communication.|$|E
5|$|All of the game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Shogo Sakai. Itoi saw Sakai as competing with Mother 2 composer Keiichi Suzuki for his fans. Itoi {{had to choose}} a composer from the development team who understood the series and could work full-time on the project, including other development duties. <b>Thus,</b> <b>he</b> could not choose Suzuki, who was outside the project, or Hirokazu Tanaka, who had become the president of Creatures. Sakai also understood the game's story intimately and named the Magypsies after musical terms. He worked to make the music feel similar to previous entries in the series.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> was {{wandering}} <b>thus,</b> when <b>he</b> encountered Mr. Fish, the confidential Secretary: {{in great}} agitation.|$|R

6000|$|... 'That is true,' said Kim. 'But I {{will say}} more. Look now. First {{the great man}} walks <b>thus.</b> Then <b>He</b> thinks thus.' (Kim drew a {{forefinger}} over his forehead and downwards till it came to rest by {{the angle of the}} jaw.) 'Anon He twitches his fingers <b>thus.</b> Anon <b>He</b> thrusts his hat under his left armpit.' Kim illustrated the motion and stood like a stork.|$|R
5|$|Amir {{was born}} as Tengkoe Amir Hamzah Pangeran Indra Poetera in Tanjung Pura, Langkat, North Sumatra, the {{youngest}} son of Vice Sultan Tengku Muhammad Adil and {{his third wife}} Tengku Mahjiwa. Through his father, he {{was related to the}} Sultan of Langkat, Machmud. Sources disagree over his date of birth. The date officially recognised by the Indonesian government is 28 February 1911, a date Amir used throughout his life. However, his elder brother Abdullah Hod states that the poet was born on 11 February 1911. Amir later took the name of his grandfather, Teungku Hamzah, as a second name; <b>thus,</b> <b>he</b> was referred to as Amir Hamzah. Though a child of nobility, he would often associate with non-nobles.|$|E
5|$|As the Emperor's {{personal}} taster, Halotus would accompany Claudius {{to every}} banquet and dinner and as chief steward, {{he would have}} been with Claudius and his family {{for the majority of the}} time. <b>Thus</b> <b>he</b> could have formed a relationship with Agrippina the Younger, suggesting the possibility of their collaboration in poisoning Claudius. It also meant that {{he would have been}} aware of details such as the Emperor's food preferences, his meal times and his schedule, making it easier for him to commit the murder.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the season, Underwood is trying to erase all links to Russo's death. <b>Thus,</b> <b>he</b> kills Barnes by shoving her in front of an oncoming Washington Metro train, and frames her colleague and lover Lucas Goodwin (Sebastian Arcelus) for cyberterrorism. Another early task for newly promoted Underwood is finding his own replacement as House Majority Whip. He supports Jacqueline Sharp (Molly Parker), a military veteran and third-term Representative from California, although he refrains from offering public backing.|$|E
60|$|<b>Thus</b> did <b>he</b> escape, and <b>thus</b> was <b>he</b> borne--a limp, agonised, and {{bleeding}} mass, {{to the house}} of Duhamel. The old schoolmaster received them with tears in his eyes--nor were they altogether tears of sorrow, for all that poor Caron's mangled condition grieved him sorely; they were in a measure tears of thankfulness; for Duhamel had not dared hope to see the young man alive again.|$|R
6000|$|While <b>he</b> <b>thus</b> meditated, <b>he</b> {{was engaged}} in {{fastening}} up his horse in a shed.

5|$|Back in Uppsala, Linnaeus' {{relations}} with Nils Rosén worsened, and <b>thus</b> <b>he</b> gladly accepted {{an invitation from}} the student Claes Sohlberg to spend the Christmas holiday in Falun with Sohlberg's family. Sohlberg's father was a mining inspector, and let Linnaeus visit the mines near Falun. Sohlberg's father suggested to Linnaeus he should bring Sohlberg to the Dutch Republic and continue to tutor him there for an annual salary. At that time, the Dutch Republic {{was one of the}} most revered places to study natural history and a common place for Swedes to take their doctoral degree; Linnaeus, who was interested in both of these, accepted.|$|E
5|$|Balard found bromine {{chemicals}} in the ash of seaweed from the salt marshes of Montpellier. The seaweed was used to produce iodine, but also contained bromine. Balard distilled the bromine from a solution of seaweed ash saturated with chlorine. The properties of the resulting substance were intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine; <b>thus</b> <b>he</b> tried {{to prove that the}} substance was iodine monochloride (ICl), but after failing to do so he was sure that he had found a new element, and named it muride, derived from the Latin word muria for brine.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{attempts}} to reinspire Krusty by showing him old episodes of the show, but {{he picks up}} on the repetitive nature of his own jokes, and binge drinks in anger. He passes out and has a vision of himself in Jewish Heaven, where he meets Rodney Dangerfield. Rabbi Krustofski then appears and tells Krusty that Jews {{do not believe in}} Heaven, and <b>thus</b> <b>he</b> should do more to help others. An act of kindness does not seem to make him happier, but Bart takes Krusty to the synagogue, where Rabbi Krustofski's favorite Rabbi recites Krusty's jokes on religion. Krusty therefore deduces that his father did find him funny, and sees him again in Jewish Heaven, where Jesus turns Dangerfield's water into a Bloody Mary.|$|E
