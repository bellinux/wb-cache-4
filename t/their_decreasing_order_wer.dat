In {{the present research}} study efforts {{will be made to}} reduce the wear rate of Braking Disc Rotor with surface modifications techniques and comparison of wear properties grade of cast iron GI 250 coated by WC– 12 CO and Stellite- 6 deposited by Detonation spray processes is presented. The results show that the WC- 12 CO on GI 250 grey cast iron performs slightly better than the Stellite- 6 coating. The WC- 12 CO-GI 250 coating substrate combination has shown minimum Cumulative Volume loss among all the two combinations. The wear resistance for coating–substrate combinations in <b>their</b> <b>decreasing</b> <b>order</b> is WC- 12 CO-GI 250 >Stellite 6 -GI 250...|$|R
50|$|While {{modern science}} is ignorant {{as to the}} agency {{responsible}} for 'big bang' in the cosmic egg, the Indian Rishis {{say that it is}} the Akshara Brahma who imparts vibration in Mool Prakriti and thus starts the creation of the universe. In the process of creation, five basic elements are first created. They are Akasha (space), Vayu (air), Agni (fire), Jala (water) and Prithivi (earth). They are listed here in <b>their</b> <b>decreasing</b> <b>order</b> of subtleness and their respective qualities are sound (Shabda), touch (Sparsha), form (Roopa), taste (Rasa) and smell (Gandha). All objects are made of these five subtle elements. Our five senses are created to receive the five different sensations of the five basic elements. All parts of our bodies are manifestations of Prakriti, except mind and Pranas, which originate from Akshara Brahma.|$|R

30|$|We {{carried out}} an InParanoid (Ostlund et al. 2010) {{analysis}} to generate gene family clusters (Shulaev et al. 2011) and thereby identify Arabidopsis genes orthologous to rice. A homolog {{with a score}} of 1.0 was considered a true ortholog and any gene with a score of[*]≥[*] 0.3 was considered a paralog in <b>their</b> <b>decreasing</b> <b>order</b> of homology. The list of 430 curated rice gene interactors was used to query the homology-based gene family cluster data and create a mapping file listing the gene identifiers from both species. Three gene homolog files were created (1) with rice and Arabidopsis orthologs only and (2) two separate files with rice and Arabidopsis paralogs respectively. The files include common gene symbols assigned by TAIR ([URL] and extracted using Gramene Biomart (Spooner et al. 2012). This data {{is used by the}} Pathway GeneSWAPPER tool to either create orthology based projects for another species or enrich the existing species-specific networks by adding paralogs as new interactors.|$|R

40|$|The {{previously}} formulated rate-type aging creep law {{based on}} Maxwell chain is generalized to variable humidity and is calibrated by extensive comparisons with test {{data from the}} literature. The main object of attention is the Pickett effect, i. e., the apparent increase in creep due to drying simultaneous with loading. This effect is shown to have four sources, in <b>their</b> <b>decreasing</b> <b>order</b> of importance: (1) stress-induced shrinkage, (2) tensile strain softening due to progressive cracking, (3) irreversibility of unloading contraction after tensile strain-softening, and (4) increase of material stiffness due to aging (hydration). The model, which is a special case of a previously advanced thermodynamic theory, depends on only one hypothesis about the microscopic physical mechanism of creep: The creep rate depends on {{the magnitude of the}} flux of microdiffusion of water between the macropores (capillary pores) and the micropores in the cement gel. By assuming this microdiffusion to be infinitely fast, the effect is reduced to a dependence of creep viscosities on the time rate of pore humidity, and this is further shown to be equivalent to stress-induced shrinkage, in which the shrinkage coefficient defining the ratio of the increments of shrinkage strain and pore relative humidity depends on stress. In three dimensions, the shrinkage coefficient thu...|$|R

They also stimulated {{adenylate cyclase}} activity through these receptors, <b>their</b> <b>decreasing</b> <b>order</b> of potency being VIP greater than [D-Ala 4]VIP greater than [D-Asp 3]VIP greater than [D-Ser 2]VIP greater than [D-His 1]VIP greater than [D-Phe 2]VIP greater than [D-Arg 2]VIP, {{with the latter}} two peptides acting as partial agonists only. All VIP analogs tested on rat pancreatic membranes were able to stimulate adenylate cyclase, their order of potency being {{very similar to that}} observed on hepatic membranes. [D-Ser 2]VIP, [D-His 1]VIP, [D-Arg 2]VIP and [D-Phe 2]VIP were partial agonists with an intrinsic activity of, respectively, 0. 8, 0. 7, 0. 35 and 0. 09 as compared to that of VIP = 1. 0. [D-Phe 2]VIP competitively and selectively inhibited VIP-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity (Ki = 0. 1 microM). On male rat anterior pituitary homogenates the order of potency of the peptides was VIP greater than [D-Ala 4]VIP greater than [D-Asp 3]VIP greater than [D-Ser 2]VIP greater than [D-His 1]VIP. [D-Ser 2]VIP and [D-His 1]VIP acted as partial agonists. Besides, [D-Phe 2]VIP and [D-Arg 2]VIP were inactive as well as unable to inhibit VIP-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. These results indicated that (a) the efficacy of VIP receptor/effector coupling depended on the tissue tested; (b) the possibility exists to design a VIP antagonist by appropriate modification in the N-terminal moiety of the molecule.

40|$|Lead (Pb) is a {{very stable}} metal in soil and is highly toxic to humans and animals. Exposure to Pb occurs via {{inhalation}} of particles from industry and soil, as well as household dust, water, and contaminated food. A greenhouse experiment was carried out to evaluate Pb contents and allocation in vegetable crops grown in a soil contaminated by battery recycling wastes. Eight plant species were studied: tomato, sweet pepper, beet, carrot, cabbage, green collards, eggplant, and okra. The experiment {{was set up in}} blocks at random with four replicates. The results showed that carrot, green collards, beet, and okra were the most Pb tolerant species, while the others were very Pb-sensitive, since they did not complete <b>their</b> cycle.

This study aimed to measure the nutrients accumulation during the growth of fruits in physic nut and the nutrients export from the area due to seed harvest and hull removal. Fruits were harvested at different times (11, 19, 27, 35, 43, 51, and 59 days after anthesis), in a completely randomized design with four replications. Nutrient content was measured in the whole fruit and in the hull and seed separately. Nutrients accumulate in the fruit during its growth. Nitrogen is the nutrient accumulated in the greatest amount, followed by potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and sulfur. For the micronutrients, <b>their</b> content <b>decreased</b> in <b>order</b> of: zinc, manganese, copper, and iron. There was a high demand for Ca, Mg, Cu, Zn, and Mn in the early fruit development.

For entries with identical spelling, including tones, arrangement is by order of frequency, indicated by a superscript number before the transcription, a device adapted from Western lexicographic practice to distinguish homonyms.

For entries that are homographic if tones are disregarded, the item of highest usage frequency is indicated by an asterisk following the transcription (see a* 啊 above), for instance, [...] "lìguǐ 厉鬼 [...] ferocious ghost" [...] and [...] "lìguì* 立柜 [...] clothes-closet; wardrobe; hanging cupboard". While frequency information is useful for students learning vocabulary, the ABC Dictionary chiefly provides it in order to help determine the default items in computer usage.
