5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Provisional Government was overthrown by the Bolsheviks, and Russia became part of the new Soviet Union. As the promotion of state atheism was a part of Marxist–Leninist ideology, the Soviet government ordered many churches closed. The Peter and Paul parish was formally dissolved by the communist government in 1929, and celebrating Mass was forbidden. The church lost much of its surrounding gardens in 1935—a school was built there the following year—and <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> finally closed on 30 July 1938 (the St. Peter and Paul church had met the same fate nine days earlier). <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> plundered after its closure, and many items, including the main altar and the organ, were irretrievably lost. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> used for several months as a vegetable store, and was then reconstructed as a hostel and its interior divided into four floors.|$|E
5|$|On March 23, 1688, the sheet-copper roof of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{destroyed}} in a fire, but <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> restored relatively quickly. The storm in 1726 destroyed the roof again. The decreased congregation {{could not afford}} the renovation {{and moved to the}} town church. In the 19th century, the reconstruction of the ruins into a romantic castle park was started.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>is</b> {{built in}} <b>the</b> Gothic Revival style that was popular during the Victorian era. However the {{exterior}} of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>is</b> simple with <b>the</b> bell tower abutting the Altar.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>is</b> {{located along}} <b>the</b> Bjugnfjorden about 5 km west of Botngård. <b>The</b> {{cruciform}} <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built in 1956 after the previous building burned {{in a fire}} in 1952. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>is</b> a copy of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> that <b>was</b> built there in 1637.|$|R

5|$|St Paul's, {{commonly}} known as the Actors' Church, was built in 1633, at a cost of £4,000, though was not consecrated until 1638. In 1645 Covent Garden was made a separate parish and <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> dedicated to St Paul. How much of Jones's original building is left is unclear, as <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> damaged by fire in 1795 during restoration work by Thomas Hardwick; the columns are thought to be original but the rest is mostly Georgian or Victorian reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|St. Toros Church (Սուրբ Թորոս եկեղեցի, Surb T'oros yekeğetsi). According {{to local}} tradition, <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built between 1270 and 1289 by Hethum I, the Armenian King of Cilicia {{in memory of}} his son, Toros, {{who was killed in}} a battle. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> renovated to its current state in 1727.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} by Dutch architect W. I. van Bakel in a neogothic style. The construction costs of 110,000 gulden were funded partly by the colonial government, {{as well as}} the sale of unused land and donations from Catholics throughout the colony. The first stone was laid by the pastor Lijnen on 1 October 1870, and construction continued smoothly until 12 May 1873, when the nearly completed tower collapsed; various reasons have been put forward, including an insufficient frame and poor quality bricks. After the collapse, the design of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> modified to be lower, and further construction was undertaken using bricks imported from the Netherlands as ballast for ships. The construction of the building was completed on 12 December 1875, and <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> blessed by Lijnen. It was the first Catholic church in the city, and served mostly those of European or mixed descent.|$|E
5|$|A pseudo-Egyptian obelisk {{near the}} {{south-east}} {{corner of the}} parish church, similar to one in Leigh, was probably built for Robert Vernon Atherton in 1781. It was restored in 1867 twelve years before <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> finished. It is a Grade II listed structure.|$|E
5|$|According to Armando Maya Castro, many {{students}} {{who are members of}} the church have been discriminated against for refusing to partake in celebrations and customs concerning the Day of the Dead in their schools, and some have been punished for it. In one case reported by a Mexican newspaper, La Gaceta, a female member of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> pushed by a fellow bus passenger, who then crossed herself because the member was wearing a long skirt. In July 25, 2008, a public official sealed the entrance to a La Luz del Mundo temple in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, trapping the congregation inside until other officials removed the seals. This incident occurred because of complaints from individuals who did not like the presence of the church in the area. Reporter Rodolfo Chávez Calderón stated that <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> in compliance with local laws.|$|E
50|$|Inside, <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>is</b> ornately {{decorated}} by symbolic biblical murals and grand statues.

5|$|All Hallows Church is {{the oldest}} {{existing}} building in Wellingborough and dates from c.1160. The manor of Wellingborough belonged to Crowland Abbey Lincolnshire, from Saxon times and the monks probably built the original church. The earliest {{part of the building}} is the Norman doorway opening in from the later south porch. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> enlarged with the addition of more side chapels {{and by the end of}} the 13th century had assumed more or less its present plan. The west tower, crowned with a graceful broach spire rising to , was completed about 1270, after which the chancel was rebuilt and given the east window twenty years later. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> restored in 1861 by Edmund Francis Law.

5|$|Although it {{has gained}} a {{significant}} online presence, it was successful {{before the advent of}} Internet communities. <b>The</b> <b>Church</b> <b>was</b> a pioneer in the religious use of zines; Cusack notes that its use of the medium {{can be seen as a}} rejection of the alienation of labor practices.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Katay {{became the}} 18th rector in early 2005.

5|$|Another legend {{tells of}} the digging of the church into the ground after the Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria (14th–15th centuries), so that the Ottomans would not desecrate it. According to that story, <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> buried and {{forgotten}} about by the villagers until the mid-19th century, when a local coincidentally rediscovered it while tying his donkey to a nearby cherry tree. A different version places the cherry tree {{on top of the}} hill under which the church stood. Reportedly, that cherry tree was struck by a thunderbolt, which enabled the villagers to reach the buried gate through the now-hollow trunk. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> reconsecrated soon thereafter and dedicated to the 4th-century military saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{increase}} in new converts in a short period, <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> moved to its present location in Ijeshatedo on a sixty plot of land which can contain over 30,000 members in a service.|$|E
5|$|In 1849, the new Roman Republic {{adopted an}} Italian tricolour, sent from Venice, bearing the legend DIO E POPOLO in red capital letters. This lasted for four months, while the Papal States of <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>was</b> in abeyance.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, just {{sixteen years}} after it was built, <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{destroyed}} by fire. This was not uncommon, however, as devastating fires frequently plagued the developing colony, and a new cathedral was quickly built on the same site. It featured iconic twin steeples at its facade. However, the Victoria Harbour waterfront district where <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> situated became more overcrowded with the rapid growth of Hong Kong at the time, and it became apparent that a permanent and larger cathedral was necessary. As a result, plans were made for a new church on a more elevated ground in Mid-Levels, located close to the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens.|$|E
