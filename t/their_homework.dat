5|$|DOS (Disk Operating System) was the {{operating}} system that brought the company its real success. IBM first approached Microsoft about its upcoming IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) in July 1980. On August 12, 1981, after negotiations with Digital Research failed, IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft to provide {{a version of the}} CP/M operating system, which was set {{to be used in the}} IBM PC. For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products for less than US$100,000, which IBM renamed to IBM PC DOS. Microsoft did not have an operating system when they closed the deal with IBM and IBM had not done <b>their</b> <b>homework.</b> Due to potential copyright infringement problems with CP/M, IBM marketed both CP/M and PC DOS for US$240 and US$40, respectively, with PC DOS eventually becoming the standard because of its lower price. 35 of the company's 100 employees worked on the IBM project for more than a year. When the IBM PC debuted, Microsoft was the only company that offered operating system, programming language, and application software for the new computer.|$|E
5|$|German {{was first}} {{introduced}} into the curriculum in 1931, the same time at which the school began to offer voluntary after-school art classes. F. H. Taylor attempted to achieve equilibrium in the curriculum between arts and science subjects; he made woodwork and art continuous for an entire term and introduced a geography course for the Higher School Certificate. In 1948 rural biology {{was added to the}} curriculum for the first time, for which the headmaster provided a plot of land {{to be used as a}} vegetable plot. At the end of that year, an after-school study period was introduced; following the seven normal periods (five in the morning, two in the afternoon), students were to either begin <b>their</b> <b>homework,</b> or attend a school society. However, the 1950s saw a definite swing towards maths and science, and a subsequent increase in staffing in those departments. In 1957, zoology and botany was taught at A-level for the first time, and physics and chemistry replaced rural biology at O-level (now replaced by the GCSE).|$|E

50|$|The Learning Resources centre, or LRC for short, is the school's library centre, where {{students}} have a choice {{from a wide range}} of books available, and have many resources available to help them with <b>their</b> <b>homework's.</b> The LRC is used after school to host a Homework Club, {{where students}} can do <b>their</b> <b>homework's</b> and revise using the school's facilities. In December 2015, a new initiative by the school's Maths reps and Maths Department led to the creation of a school tuck shop in the LRC, supplying stationery to students at an inexpensive price. For example, a pencil can be bought for the small price of 10 Pence, making it easy for all students to be well equipped. The LRC is also used for lessons, where teachers read to students or students can revise for exams. The LRC offers printing facilities for students to print their work, and offers a great all-round experience.|$|R

25|$|The four House dormitories have secret entrances, {{generally}} {{known only}} to members of that house and require a password (Gryffindor & Slytherin), riddle answer (Ravenclaw) or ritual (Hufflepuff) {{in order to gain}} entrance. Inside is the common room, which contains armchairs and sofas for the pupils and tables for studying and homework. There are fireplaces to keep the rooms warm, and students either relax here in the evenings or else complete <b>their</b> <b>homework,</b> but may complete their work in the bedroom. There are notice boards in each common room and at other strategic points throughout the school. The students sleep in their House dormitories, which branch off from the common rooms. Each dormitory gets at least two rooms; one for boys and one for girls (an enchantment prevents boys from entering the girls' area, although there is no spell to prevent the reverse from occurring). Each student sleeps in a large four-poster bed with bed covers and heavy curtains in the House colours, and thick white pillows. There is a bedside table for each bed, and each dormitory has a jug of water and goblets on a tray.|$|E

Nick Pinkerton of Sci Fi Weekly called Fox and Seyfried's lesbian kissing scene [...] "the best close-up girl-girl liplock" [...] since Cruel Intentions, and A. O.

The 29 shows in North America had grossed around US $26 million, with an average of almost $900,000 per show. Fogel also addressed concerns that Live Nation had lost $30 million from Gaga's tour, saying that if a similar situation really happened, then the company would have cancelled the concerts.

During the 1930s the popularity of the new [...] "picture houses" [...] grew rapidly, with 109 in Manchester at its peak. Many people visited The Scala {{three or four times a}} week. The craze for cinema-going was seen by some as a social ill of its time; school teachers complained that pupils were not doing <b>their</b> <b>homework</b> because they were spending too much time at the cinema. One regular movie-goer at the cinema in the 1920s was Robert Donat, a local boy who went on to become an Oscar-winning actor.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the involvement of parents in <b>their</b> children’s <b>homework</b> in the Umlazi District, Mayville Circuit, KwaZulu-Natal. A literature review investigated the nature of parental involvement in learner schoolwork, the role and function of homework in education, models of effective teacher practices to ensure parental involvement in homework and an empirical study that investigated perceptions of teachers, managers and parents regarding effective parental involvement in homework in education. The findings indicate that most teachers agreed that parental involvement in homework is important for learner achievement.

40|$|A {{high level}} of parental {{involvement}} is widely considered to be essential for optimal child and adolescent development and wellbeing, including academic success. However, recent consideration {{has been given to}} the idea that extremely high levels of parental involvement (often called ‘overparenting’ or ‘helicopter parenting’) might not be beneficial. This study used a newly created overparenting measure, the Locke Parenting Scale (LPS), to investigate the association of overparenting and children’s homework. Eight hundred and sixty-six parents completed online questionnaires about their parenting beliefs and intentions, and their attitudes associated with <b>their</b> child’s <b>homework.</b> Parents with higher LPS scores tended to take more personal responsibility for the completion of <b>their</b> child’s <b>homework</b> than did other parents, and ascribed greater responsibility for <b>homework</b> completion to <b>their</b> child’s teacher. However, increased perceived responsibility by parents and teachers was not accompanied by a commensurate reduction in what they perceived was the child’s responsibility. Future research should examine whether extreme parental attitudes and reported behaviours translate to validated changes in actual homework support...|$|R

[...] Although they allowed a camera crew to film them for a French television arts program at the time, Daft Punk did not wish to speak on screen [...] "because it is dangerous." [...] During <b>their</b> <b>Homework</b> years, the duo would usually wear a variety of masks to hide their appearance. Bangalter noted that “the foundation for a lot of what we’re about artistically" [...] is the 1974 film Phantom of the Paradise, in which the title character prominently wears a mask. Daft Punk were also fans of the 1970s band Space, known for wearing space suits with helmets that hid the performers' appearance. In 1998, the Bangalter side project Stardust experimented with the band wearing reflective costumes in their music video. When not wearing disguises, Daft Punk occasionally preferred to be replaced by animation (as they appeared in The Work of Director Michel Gondry DVD) or have their faces digitally obscured for press kits. Few official photos of the duo's faces exist, including a blurry one found in the Homework liner notes.|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} joint-liability incentives in the classroom using a randomized field experiment. The instructor design groups of three {{students in the classroom}} and provides a premium to <b>their</b> <b>homework's</b> grade only if all three members of the group accomplish some requirements. To isolate the joint liability effect from selfish motivations, we design also an individual incentives treatment. We find that joint-liability incentives impact positively on the grades accomplished in homework and midterm exams both in the experimental courses and in the other courses taken by the students in the semester. Though the positive average effect seems to disappear in the final exams, the overall impact of joint-liability incentives on the academic achievements in the semester is still positive. A drawback of this program is a decrease in the satisfaction with classmates. The significant effectiveness of the peer monitoring developed by the joint liability of group incentives provides novel implications for the design of the grading policies in the classroom and for other social settings where incentives may be based in peer monitoring or joint liability. ...|$|R
