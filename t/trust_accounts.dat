2500|$|If {{a trustee}} has broken a duty {{owed to the}} trust, there are three main remedies. First, {{specific}} performance may generally be awarded {{in cases where the}} beneficiary merely wishes to compel a trustee to follow the trust's terms, or to prevent an anticipated breach. Second, for losses, beneficiaries may claim compensation. The applicable principles are disputed, given the historical language of requiring a trustee to [...] "account" [...] for things which go wrong. One view suggested that at the very moment a trustee breaches a duty, for instance by making an erroneous investment without considering relevant matters, beneficiaries have a right to see the <b>trust</b> <b>accounts</b> are surcharged, to erase the transpiring loss (and [...] "falsified" [...] to restore to the trust fund unauthorised gains). In Target Holdings Ltd v Redferns the argument was taken to a new level, where a solicitor (a fiduciary, like a trustee) was given £1.5m by Target Holdings Ltd to hold for a loan for some property developers, but released the money before it was meant to (when purchase of the development property was completed). The money did reach the developers, but the venture was a flop, and money lost. Target Holdings Ltd attempted to sue Redferns for the whole sum, but the House of Lords held that the loss was caused by the venture flop, not the solicitor's action outside instructions. It was, however, observed that the common law rules of remoteness would not apply. Similarly in Swindle v Harrison a solicitor, Mr Swindle, could not be sued for the loss of Ms Harrison's second home's value after he gave her negligent and dishonest advice about loans, because she would have taken the loan and made the purchase anyway, and the house value drop was unrelated to his breach of duty.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{alternatives}} {{exist to}} standard retainage provisions {{that provide the}} same benefits and protections. For example, parties can agree to establish a <b>trust</b> <b>account.</b> A <b>trust</b> <b>account</b> provides the contractor with some control over its money, {{even if it is}} being held by the owner. In a <b>trust</b> <b>account,</b> retainage is withheld by the owner, placed in a <b>trust</b> <b>account</b> with a trustee that has a fiduciary relationship to the contractor. The trustee can invest the retainage at the contractor's direction, thereby allowing the contractor to [...] "use" [...] the retained funds that normally would sit idle in an escrow account.|$|R

Clients tend to have complete confidence {{in the fact that}} their money is entrusted thus. Its very designation as trust money encourages such confidence. The <b>trust</b> <b>account</b> is also the account in respect of which the Attorneys Fidelity Fund requires an annual audit to determine if an attorney is awarded the Fidelity Fund Certificate which he requires to practise. All in all, the <b>trust</b> <b>account</b> is the barometer of the good standing of a law practice, and the index of its trustworthiness. Hence the aura of venerability which surrounds it.
