60|$|The rains abated, and the <b>temporary</b> <b>labour</b> was discharged; not Norris, to {{whom the}} {{engineer}} clung as to found money; not Norris, who found himself a ganger {{on the line in}} the regular staff of navvies. His camp was pitched in a grey wilderness of rock and forest, far from any house; as he sat with his mates about the evening fire, the trains passing on the track were their next, and indeed their only, neighbours, except the wild things of the wood. Lovely weather, light and monotonous employment, long hours of somnolent camp-fire talk, long sleepless nights, when he reviewed his foolish and fruitless career as he rose and walked in the moonlit forest, an occasional paper of which he would read all, the advertisements with as much relish as the text; such was the tenor of an existence which soon began to weary and harass him. He lacked and regretted the fatigue, the furious hurry, the suspense, the fires, the midnight coffee, the rude and mud-bespattered poetry of the first toilful weeks. In the quietness of his new surroundings a voice summoned him from this exorbital part of life, and about the middle of October he threw up his situation and bade farewell to the camp of tents and the shoulder of Bald Mountain.|$|E

40|$|Over recent decades, {{developments}} in network governance have seen governments {{around the world}} cede considerable authority and responsibility to commercial migration intermediaries for recruiting and managing <b>temporary</b> migrant <b>labour.</b> Correspondingly, a by-product of network governance has been the emergence of soft employment regulation in which voluntary codes of conduct supplement hard (enforceable) legal employment standards. This paper explores these {{developments in}} the context of temporary migrant workers employed in Australian horticulture. First the paper analyses the growing use of <b>temporary</b> migrant <b>labour</b> in this industry. It then describes how different types of intermediaries interact with this workforce. The paper then outlines both hard and soft employment regulations, and contrasts them with actual employment conditions, questioning how a network governance approach has affected this vulnerable workforce. The paper concludes that changes in network governance of migration and employment relations have emasculated formal legal regulation, leaving market forces to operate without effective or ethical constraints {{at the expense of the}} public good...|$|R

50|$|However, the locum {{situation}} {{also has}} a number of disadvantages - the transient nature means extra stress and work for the locums whenever they have to fit into a new position, and for the hiring organisation, this generally means that the required flexibility (and often, the lack of a guaranteed income) has to be rewarded with high salaries. These may in the long term create higher costs for the hiring organisation than adding more full-time positions (especially in highly skilled, accredited professions, and unlike the situation in some professions where cheap <b>temporary</b> <b>labour</b> or significant use of interns actually undercuts wages and reduces total staff costs).|$|E

50|$|Scholars {{have argued}} that {{neoliberal}} policies have been a prominent component in {{the erosion of the}} standard employment relationship. This precarious new model of employment has greatly reduced the worker’s ability to negotiate and, in particular, with the introduction of advanced technology (that can easily replace the worker), reduced the temp’s bargaining power. Internet of Things-based companies such as Uber have come into conflict with authorities and workers for circumventing labour and social security obligations. It has been suggested that labour regulations in North America do little in addressing labour market insecurities and the precarious nature of <b>temporary</b> <b>labour.</b> In many cases, legislation has done little to acknowledge or adapt to the growth of non-standard employment in Canada.|$|E

However, permanent emigration is a relatively new phenomenon. There have been two major waves of emigration from Zimbabwe.

In both cases, South Africa was again their primary destination. From 1994 onwards, the South African government displayed increasing hostility to skilled immigration from the rest of Africa. However, this has not served to limit the number of immigrants; Zimbabwean {{migration to}} South Africa since 2000 has been described as the [...] "largest concentrated flow" [...] in the country's history.

40|$|Across the Asia-Pacific region, {{increasing}} numbers of women are migrating transnationally for low-skill work while their children remain in home communities, fostered by family or neighbours. Drawing on ethnographic research conducted in 2014 – 15 in Lombok, Indonesia, this paper describes a sedentary child bias within Indonesian policies, and how this bias constrains migrant mothers’ choices regarding the care and well-being of their children. Vignettes describing the challenges of caregivers in Lombok families illustrate how the absence of social services, local forms of child fostering and limits on transnational adoption and child mobility together significantly curtail migrant mothers’ opportunities to arrange optimal support for their children while working abroad.

At the other extreme, there are skilled and semi-skilled temporary agency workers who face a shortfall in demand for permanent, direct hire employees.

The findings differ substantially {{between the two groups}} of agency workers, contributing to significantly different perceptions of the personal benefits of working through a temporary employment agency. <br /...|$|R
