5|$|According to the JNA an {{additional}} 450 troops were deployed to the barracks (despite the blockade) from 22 October to 4 November, primarily tank crews {{assigned to the}} 9th Motorised Brigade and two companies of SAO Krajina TO from Vojnić. The reinforcements crossed the Korana River, adjacent to the barracks, and their movements led to several skirmishes. By 4 November, the barracks housed a 685-strong garrison. During {{the second half of}} October, the 129th and 137th Infantry Brigades were established in Karlovac and nearby Duga Resa to bolster Croatian defences. The two new brigades were assigned areas of responsibility (AORs) on 29 November by the Karlovac Operational Zone commanding officer, Colonel Izidor Češnjaj; the 110th and 137th Brigade AORs were just south of the Logorište barracks. The 137th Infantry Brigade was commanded by Major Nedjeljko Katušin. The 110th Infantry Brigade deployed <b>three</b> <b>companies</b> of its 1st Battalion north and west of the Logorište barracks, while <b>three</b> <b>companies</b> of its 3rd Battalion were deployed south of the barracks. Further south, <b>three</b> <b>companies</b> of the 3rd Battalion of the 137th Infantry Brigade faced the Korana. The 1/110th Brigade was supported by two companies of police (including an antitank and sniper group of special police reserve troops commanded by Želimir Feitl) in Sv. Doroteja, north of the barracks. The 3/137th Brigade was supported by {{an additional}} company of police. The 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Guards Brigade was ordered to redeploy to Banovina; most of its troops were on leave or had left the area, and only a squad remained {{in the rear of the}} 137th Infantry Brigade.|$|E
50|$|<b>Three's</b> <b>Company</b> {{producers}} {{were anxious}} to capitalize on these spin-offs. In 1979, they had spun off Norman Fell and Audra Lindley into their own series The Ropers, based on George and Mildred, but it lasted only until 1980 after {{one and a half}} seasons. <b>Three's</b> <b>Companys</b> ratings remained high though. Executive producers Ted Bergmann and Don Taffner attempted to adapt the Robin's Nest series without John Ritter. A pilot for a series called Byrd's Nest was written, involving a young man living with his older girlfriend much to the chagrin of her father, who owned the building they lived in. The series was planned to be a spin-off from <b>Three's</b> <b>Company</b> and possibly a vehicle for Richard Kline, who played Larry Dallas on <b>Three's</b> <b>Company,</b> but ABC passed on the idea. However, as <b>Three's</b> <b>Company</b> entered its eighth season in 1983, ratings took a dive due to stiff competition from the new NBC series The A-Team. Realizing they had an aging show ABC okayed {{the development of a new}} series which was to be called Three's a Crowd.|$|R
