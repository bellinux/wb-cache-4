5|$|In the game, Mario {{is portrayed}} as an Italian-American plumber who, along with his younger brother Luigi, has to defeat creatures that have been coming from the sewers below New York City. The {{gameplay}} focuses on Mario's extermination of them by flipping them on <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> kicking them away. The original versions of Mario Bros.—the arcade version and the Family Computer/Nintendo Entertainment System (FC/NES) version—were received positively by critics.|$|E
5|$|Murray cod {{are white}} to cream on their ventral (belly) surfaces. <b>Their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> flanks are usually yellowish-green to green, overlain with heavy darker green, but {{occasionally}} brown or black, mottling. The {{effect is a}} marbled appearance sometimes reminiscent of a leopard's markings. Colouration is related to water clarity; colouration is intense in fish from clear water habitats. Small to medium-sized Murray cod from clear-water habitats often have striking and very distinct colouration. Very large fish tend towards a speckled grey-green colouration.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after waking, red pandas clean their fur {{somewhat}} {{like a cat}} would, licking their front paws and then rubbing their backs, torsos, and sides. They also rub <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> bellies {{along the sides of}} trees or rocks. Then they patrol their territories, marking with urine and a weak musk-smelling secretion from their anal glands. They search for food running along the ground or through the trees. Red pandas may use their forepaws alternately to bring food to their mouths or place food directly into their mouths.|$|E

5000|$|The {{active partner}} (with breasts) lies on <b>their</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> the {{receiver}} inserts their penis between the breasts, {{and into the}} mouth.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{flags in}} Japan {{date from the}} unification period in the late 16th century. The flags belonged to each daimyō and were used primarily in battle. Most of the flags were long banners usually charged with the mon (family crest) of the daimyō lord. Members of the same family, such as a son, father, and brother, had different flags to carry into battle. The flags served as identification, and were displayed by soldiers on <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> horses. Generals also had their own flags, most of which differed from soldiers' flags due to their square shape.|$|E
5|$|Thrips setipennis is {{the sole}} {{pollinator}} of Wilkiea huegeliana, a small, unisexual annually flowering tree or shrub in the rainforests of eastern Australia. T. setipennis serves as an obligate pollinator for other Australian rainforest plant species, including Myrsine howittiana and M. variabilis. The genus Cycadothrips is a specialist pollinator of cycads, the flowers of which are adapted for pollination by small insects. Thrips are likewise the primary pollinators of heathers in the family Ericaceae, and {{play a significant role}} in the pollination of pointleaf manzanita. Electron microscopy has shown thrips carrying pollen grains adhering to <b>their</b> <b>backs,</b> <b>and</b> their fringed wings are perfectly capable of allowing them to fly from plant to plant.|$|E
5|$|After Mayor Quimby {{makes an}} {{offensive}} joke about France, {{and refuses to}} apologize, the French president launches a neutron bomb directly into Springfield, killing everyone except Homer, who had been inspecting a bomb shelter he was considering buying from Herman's military surplus store. After the blast, Homer emerges from the shelter {{and seems to be}} the only person in town to survive the blast, but he is soon confronted by a band of hostile Springfield citizens who have become mutants. Homer flees back home where he discovers that his family survived the blast because their house was protected by its layers of lead paint. Marge and the children kill the mutants with shotguns that they were hiding behind <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> the family head off to steal some Ferraris.|$|E
50|$|Blues musicians such as Charley Patton {{would use}} stunts such as playing the guitar behind <b>their</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> these showbiz stunts were further {{developed}} by the touring R&B performers.|$|R
50|$|In winter, {{the adult}} Sandwich tern's {{forehead}} becomes white. Juvenile Sandwich terns have dark tips to their tails, and a scaly appearance on <b>their</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> wings, like juvenile roseate terns.|$|R
50|$|Gastrotheca albolineata is {{a canopy}} dweller in primary and old {{secondary}} rainforests. It requires big trees as its habitat. Females carry the eggs on <b>their</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> eggs develop directly to froglets.|$|R
5|$|Black currawongs {{are found}} singly or in pairs, but may gather into groups of 20 to 80 birds. Birds have been {{observed}} digging wet yellow clay out of a drain and applying it all over their plumage. Wiping the carpal areas of wings in particular with their bills, they {{did not appear to}} wash afterwards, using the procedure as a form of dirt bath. The black currawong has an undulating flight pattern in time with its wing beats, and often cocks its tail in the air for balance when it lands. Play behaviour has been observed, particularly with subadult individuals. Black currawongs {{have been observed}} wrestling with each other, where a bird would attempt to force its opponent on its back, at Maydena, while others have been reported rolling on <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> juggling with food items such as pears with their feet.|$|E
5|$|During the night, Pyrrhus {{was able}} to enter Argos. While Pausanias recounts that he did so by force, Plutarch asserts that Diamperes Gate had been left open for the Epiriotes by Aristeas. Hammond opines {{that it is more}} likely that Aristeas {{admitted}} Pyrrhus into the city. Although Pyrrhus' Gauls were able to occupy the Argive agora, the rest of the army was delayed due to the war elephants being too large to pass through the gate. In order for them to enter, the towers need to be taken off <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> reattached once they were inside the city. Furthermore, Pyrrhus left the majority of his army outside the city walls under the command of his son Helenus. This delay gave the Argives enough time to reach their citadel, the Aspis, and seek aid from Antigonus. The Macedonian king responded immediately, advancing towards the city walls and sending a relief force inside under the command of his son Halcyoneus.|$|E
5|$|Many {{sleeping}} birds bend {{their heads}} over <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> tuck their bills in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. Perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism {{that helps them}} {{hold on to the}} perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees. A few parrots of the genus Loriculus roost hanging upside down. Some hummingbirds go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates. This physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and woodswallows. One species, the common poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation. Birds do not have sweat glands, but they may cool themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves.|$|E
50|$|Tepee: The {{parachute}} {{is brought}} up, then the children raise their {{part of the}} parachutes over their heads <b>and</b> behind <b>their</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> sit down. This creates an air pocket which resembles a tent.|$|R
50|$|On 13 February 2006 {{the bodies}} of Sarsenbaev, his {{bodyguard}} and his driver were found dead on a road {{near the city of}} Almaty, reportedly lying face-down, hands tied on <b>their</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> shot in the head at point blank range.|$|R
5|$|Crested newts {{are dark}} brown, with black {{spots on the}} sides, and white {{stippling}} in some species. Their belly is yellow to orange with black blotches, forming a pattern characteristic for individuals. Females and juveniles of some species have a yellow line running down <b>their</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> tail. During breeding phase, crested newts change in appearance, most markedly the males. These develop a skin seam running along <b>their</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> tail; this crest is the namesake feature of the crested newts and can be up to 1.5cm high and very jagged in the northern crested newt. Another feature of males at breeding time is a silvery-white band {{along the sides of}} the tail.|$|R
25|$|Following the Rwandan Genocide in 1994, {{the first}} relief {{workers on the}} scene {{reported}} seeing hundreds of Tutsi fleeing their villages {{with little more than}} the clothes on <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> transistor radios pressed to their ears.|$|E
25|$|Eel-tailed catfish {{have large}} head with thick and fleshy lips and tubular nostrils. The skin is tough and smooth. Body {{coloration}} in adults vary from olive-green to brown, black or purplish on <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> {{white on the}} underside.|$|E
25|$|Newly hatched larvae {{are black}} with long, hair-like setae. Older larvae have five pairs of raised blue spots and six pairs of raised brick-red spots along <b>their</b> <b>backs,</b> <b>and</b> a {{sprinkling}} of setae. As the larval stage {{comes to an end}} they cease feeding and surround themselves in a silken net.|$|E
50|$|Old folk tales tell of the {{so-called}} Böxenwolf, a type of werewolf, which would ambush lone travellers walking through the Bückeberg, or even between the surrounding villages, at night. It would jump on <b>their</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> then jump off again after a while.|$|R
5000|$|The wrestler {{grabs the}} wrist of the {{opponent}} {{so that the}} arm is held bent against <b>their</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> hand forced upwards towards the neck, thereby applying pressure to the shoulder joint. It is used by many Wrestlers {{in the beginning of}} the match ...|$|R
50|$|The alpha roll is a {{controversial}} dog training technique. The theory behind the training {{method is to}} teach the dog that the trainer is the pack leader (or alpha animal). Misbehaving dogs are pinned on <b>their</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> held in that position, sometimes by the throat.|$|R
25|$|Another early type of {{soft drink}} was lemonade, made {{of water and}} lemon juice {{sweetened}} with honey, but without carbonated water. The Compagnie des Limonadiers of Paris was granted a monopoly {{for the sale of}} lemonade soft drinks in 1676. Vendors carried tanks of lemonade on <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> dispensed cups of the soft drink to Parisians.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{important}} to avoid snakes that appear to be dead, as some species will actually roll over on <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> stick out their tongue to fool potential threats. A snake's detached head can immediately act by reflex and potentially bite. The induced bite can be just as severe as that of a live snake.|$|E
25|$|Double-tailed tent spiders build large nonsticky webs of {{two parts}} – a tangle web and a finely-meshed {{horizontal}} orb web. The females of the species are larger than the males and they may vary considerably in colour. They are easily distinguishable by their shape, the markings on <b>their</b> <b>backs,</b> <b>and</b> the way the females have the habit of guarding their eggs by splaying their bodies over them.|$|E
5000|$|Deck squat: The kettlebell {{is held in}} {{two hands}} by the ball instead of the handle. The trainee squats down deeply, then rocks <b>back</b> on <b>their</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> lowers the bell {{overhead}} so that the handle touches the ground, before reverse the movement <b>and</b> standing <b>back</b> up.|$|R
50|$|Adults have rufous sides, a white {{belly and}} a long dark tail with white edges. The eyes are red. They have white spots on <b>their</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> white wing bars. Males have a dark head, upper body and tail; these parts are brown or gray in the female.|$|R
50|$|This roll starts {{by sitting}} on the floor in a {{straddle}} position. The legs are held below the knees and the body leans over towards the shoulder on one side. The gymnast then folds more tightly until they roll over <b>their</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> return to a sitting straddle position.|$|R
25|$|Bongos {{have two}} heavy and {{slightly}} spiralled horns that slope over <b>their</b> <b>backs,</b> <b>and</b> {{like many other}} antelope species, {{both male and female}} bongos have horns. Bongos are the only tragelaphids in which both sexes have horns. The horns of bongos are {{in the form of a}} lyre and bear a resemblance to those of the related antelope species of nyalas, sitatungas, bushbucks, kudus and elands.|$|E
25|$|For {{a number}} of hours, the gunmen hunted {{door-to-door}} for foreigners. They dragged people from their hiding places, beating some who did not cooperate, and shooting others {{as they tried to}} run away. Some foreigners had their hands bound behind <b>their</b> <b>backs,</b> <b>and</b> some had their mouths taped. The gunmen affixed bombs to some of the captives. Some foreigners were helped by local Algerians, who helped them hide.|$|E
25|$|Those moai {{that are}} less eroded {{typically}} have designs carved on <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> posteriors. The Routledge expedition of 1914 established a cultural link between these designs and the island's traditional tattooing, which had been repressed by missionaries a half-century earlier. Until modern DNA analysis of the islanders and their ancestors, this was key scientific evidence that the moai had been carved by the Rapa Nui and not by a separate group from South America.|$|E
50|$|Adults {{have a short}} forked brown {{tail and}} brown wings. They have a longer bill than the purple finch. Adult males are {{raspberry}} red on the head, breast, <b>back</b> <b>and</b> rump; <b>their</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> undertail are streaked. Adult females have light brown upperparts and light underparts with brown streaks throughout; their facial markings are less distinct {{than those of the}} female purple finch.|$|R
25|$|Robert Carroll and Michael DeBraga {{published}} {{a discussion about}} aigialosaurs and their evolutionary affinities. They noted that aigialosaur skulls are virtually indistinguishable from those of primitive mosasaurs. However they found the vertebrae in <b>their</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> limb bones to more closely resemble those belonging to the precursors of living monitor lizards.|$|R
50|$|Unusually, young grebes {{are capable}} of {{swimming}} and diving almost at hatching. The adults teach these skills to their young by carrying them on <b>their</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> diving, leaving the chicks to float on the surface; they then re-emerge {{a few feet away}} so that the chicks may swim back onto them.|$|R
