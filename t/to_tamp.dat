40|$|The present research, {{undertaken}} in a mangrove swamp in northeastern Brazil (Mamanguape River Estuary), examined {{the factors that}} led to the overwhelming acceptance of the tangle-netting technique by crab harvesters in detriment to the now illegal tamping technique. Both techniques are the only ones currently used at our study site and in many other areas in Brazil, despite being prohibited by law. Data were collected through direct observations to determine capture efficiency, productivity, daily production, selectivity, and harvesting effort, and through interviews with crab harvesters, focusing on their perceptions of the capture techniques, the conditions of crab stocks and the sales price of a dozen crabs. Our results indicated that the two capture techniques did not significantly differ in terms of their efficiency or productivity, but daily production rates differed significantly, being greater using tangle-netting. The tangle-netting permits a greater harvesting effort (6 hours and 34 min) compared <b>to</b> <b>tamping</b> (4 hours and 19 min). Tangle-netting is also less selective than tamping indicated by the larger number of captured smaller specimens, including females. This results in a lower average sales price for a dozen crabs caught by tangle-netting (US$ 0. 95) compared <b>to</b> <b>tamping</b> (US$ 1. 02). The greater daily production of crab harvesters using the tangle-netting technique nevertheless increased their net gain, explaining their preference for this method, Given that tangle-netting results in greater harvesting pressure but lower selectivity compared <b>to</b> <b>tamping,</b> it may potentially be less sustainable. All of the crab harvesters interviewed having more than 20 years of experience (n = 34) stated they perceived that stocks of U. cordatus had become reduced over the last 20 years, together with average crab sizes. It is now important to examine the structure of the local U. cordatus population and to assess its fishery to allow evaluating whether the illegal, but prominent tangle-netting and tamping mangrove crab capture techniques are sustainable or not. We further suggest improving the dialogue between decision makers and fishermen, which barely exists to date, to initiate a discussion about possible ways of resolving the current situation of illegality of the fishermen. This will be key to achieving effective sustainable co-management of this important natural mangrove forest resource...|$|R

40|$|Most clays, either {{naturally}} deposited or man-made, {{possess a}} certain degree of overconsolidation owing <b>to</b> <b>tamping,</b> cyclic loading, erosion, excavation, and/or changes in groundwater tables. An easy-to-use constitutive model for overconsolidated clays is useful for relevant engineering applications. In this paper, a simple model is proposed for overconsolidated clays based on the unified-hardening (UH) model. To evaluate the potential peak stress ratio of overconsolidated clays, a parabolic Hvorslev envelope rather than a straight envelope (used in the original UH model) is adopted. The proposed parabolic Hvorslev envelope passes through the origin of the mean stress-deviatoric stress plane. It has a slope of 3 as the overconsolidation ratio (OCR) approaches infinity and intersects with the critical state line as the OCR reaches unity. This modification leads to more realistic predictions for highly overconsolidated clays than does the original UH model with a straight Hvorslev envelope and is consistent with the critical state soil mechanics in which the higher peak stress ratio in overconsolidated clays is a result of interlocking (or dilatancy) rather than cohesion. The modified UH model retains the same parameters as those in the modified Cam-clay model. Reasonable agreement between the model predictions and experimental data demonstrates that the modified model is capable of addressing the fundamental behavior of overconsolidated clays. The present model is developed for reconstituted clays with an isotropic fabric. The potential improvement of the model, taking into account anisotropy and structural effects, is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to improve the fundamental understanding of mechanical behaviour of ballast and study the effect of tamping on ballast. The experiments were carried out on scaled railway ballast to eliminate the difficulties associated with testing large particle granular materials. Consideration was given to the gradation, mineralogy and shape during scaling. Particle characterisation work was carried out on scaled and full size ballast using imaging techniques to examine the validity of the use of scaled ballast. Detailed analysis of results is used to quantitatively measure the changes in shape with particle size. The results show measurable differences in particle shape between different particle size intervals. As the differences are small in magnitude, they do not invalidate the use of scaled ballast. Monotonic, cyclic experiments were carried out as part of a laboratory testing programme. Scaled ballast shows generally similar stress strain behaviour to larger granular materials. The friction angle of 40 o to 50 o for the confining pressure range of 15 kPa to 200 kPa falls within the range of friction angle obtained for full size ballast in the literature. The effect of changing confining pressure during train loading was examined. The results show that the settlement increases and the stiffness reduces when the confining pressure cycles. The effect of principal stress reversal during tamping was examined by an extension stage after the cyclic loading. It is shown that massive settlement occurs after the extension stage during initial cycles and settlement returns back to the pre-extension stage soon under loading. The results evidence the disruption of ballast structure and loss of stiffness due <b>to</b> <b>tamping.</b> Specimens were resin stabilised within the triaxial cell after specific stress paths had been followed.
