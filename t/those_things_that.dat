25|$|Communication is a {{key element}} of {{negotiation}}. Effective negotiation requires that participants effectively convey and interpret information. Participants in a negotiation communicate information not only verbally but non-verbally through body language and gestures. By understanding how nonverbal communication works, a negotiator is better equipped to interpret the information other participants are leaking non-verbally while keeping secret <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> would inhibit his/her ability to negotiate.|$|E
25|$|We are {{a people}} that follow after <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> make for peace, love, and unity; {{it is our}} desire that others' feet may walk in the same, and do deny and bear our {{testimony}} against all strife, and wars, and contentions that come from the lusts that war in the members, that war against the soul, which we wait for and watch for in all people, and love and desire the good of all.|$|E
25|$|In some people, {{gingivitis}} progresses to periodontitis – {{with the}} destruction of the gingival fibers, the gum tissues separate from the tooth and deepened sulcus, called a periodontal pocket. Subgingival microorganisms (those that exist under the gum line) colonize the periodontal pockets and cause further inflammation in the gum tissues and progressive bone loss. Examples of secondary causes are <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that,</b> by definition, cause microbic plaque accumulation, such as restoration overhangs and root proximity.|$|E

25|$|Miscarriage {{may occur}} for many reasons, {{not all of}} which can be identified. Risk factors are <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> {{increase}} the likelihood of having a miscarriage but don't necessarily cause a miscarriage. Up to 70 conditions, infections, medical procedures, lifestyle factors, occupational exposures, chemical exposure, and shift work are associated with increased risk for miscarriage. Some of these risks include endocrine, genetic, uterine, or hormonal abnormalities, reproductive tract infections, and tissue rejection caused by an autoimmune disorder.|$|E
25|$|First of all, I {{think the}} country is in deep trouble. We, as a country have blazed unimagined trails technologically and industrially. We have not yet begun to pioneer in <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are human and social… I think that social work is uniquely {{equipped}} {{to play a major role}} in this social and human renaissance of our society, which will, if successful, lead to its survival, and if it is unsuccessful, will lead to its justifiable death.|$|E
25|$|Wittgenstein also ponders the {{possibility}} of a language that talks about <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are known only to the user, whose content is inherently private. The usual example is that of a language in which one names one's sensations and other subjective experiences, such that the meaning of the term is decided by the individual alone. For example, the individual names a particular sensation, on some occasion, 'S', and intends to use that word to refer to that sensation. Such a language Wittgenstein calls a private language.|$|E

It just crossed my mind that night, 'Can I have a drink?' Obviously I can't and this reinforces that. Since that night, I have not had another thought like that. I know it's something I shouldn't do because it leads to other things.|$|E
25|$|When I had {{a meeting}} with the Council a day before the concert, they were {{absolutely}} petrified of me. I wanted to play the records and say 'I am not going to destroy you' but they were just so scared. Because they were worried about their political future. They were not thinking about Death in June as Being a Nazi group, they are thinking that I, Jean Pierre Nobody, want to be Mayor of this town and I must win the good citizens over of this town to my cause and, therefore, I will be a knight in shining armour, I will always stand up to <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> everybody hates. So, I will stand up to Nazi, skinhead hordes that are coming to destroy Lausanne.|$|E
25|$|Dreyfus also {{identified}} a subtler assumption about the world. AI researchers (and futurists and science fiction writers) often {{assume that there}} is no limit to formal, scientific knowledge, because they assume that any phenomenon in the universe can be described by symbols or scientific theories. This assumes that everything that exists can be understood as objects, properties of objects, classes of objects, relations of objects, and so on: precisely <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> can be described by logic, language and mathematics. The question of what exists is called ontology, and so Dreyfus calls this the ontological assumption. If this is false, then it raises doubts about what we can ultimately know and what intelligent machines will ultimately be able to help us to do.|$|E

25|$|As a brief example, Frame {{uses the}} {{epistemology}} of Kant, who taught that {{the categories of}} thought that are necessary for our understanding the world around us, such as causality, logic, time, space, and order, are structured by our minds and imposed upon the things we experience. In order to be rational and {{make sense out of}} life we must assume, or presuppose, these notions. Because we cannot empirically verify these categories by touch, smell, sight, etc. they must be thought of as created by and arising from our minds, thus ordering and providing the criterion for <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> we can empirically verify. This led Kant to conclude that if we are to think of anything at all we must think in terms of everything being caused by something logically and temporally prior to it. This led to a fairly deterministic view of mankind.|$|E

500|$|According to Emma Barrow of The Daily Telegraph, {{the match}} {{is said to}} have instigated the rivalry between Arsenal and Manchester United, which {{continued}} through the 1990s and 2000s. In later years, Winterburn said of the brawl: [...] "It probably caused a lot of the bad blood between the sides that has lasted for years but I was just competitive and desperate to win.

500|$|A dark, {{aggressive}} song whose lumbering, distorted guitar riff is in E minor, [...] "I'm Eighteen" [...] was the band's first hit.

500|$|... "Just A Man" [...] was {{influenced}} by Chinese classical music, Patton's vocal track being based on the style of Anthony Newley. [...] "Star A.D." [...] makes an appearance on the 2008 compilation The Works. When asked if the song was a reference to Kurt Cobain, Mike Patton stated [...] "God no! It's about a phenomenon. And if that guy happened to be one, I don't know. It's one of <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> happen; it's a Vegas thing. What could be more shameful than having to change your colostomy bag on stage?! Vegas is great, though. I love it. Welcome to America". The song [...] "What a Day" [...] includes the line [...] "Kill {{the body and the}} head will die", which was taken from Hunter S. Thompson's 1971 book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.

TV Squad writer Joel Keller gave the episode a mostly positive review, but criticized the episode for not reaching its potential. He wrote: [...] "it's one of <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that's</b> hard to put a finger on; it could be that most of the plots were a series of funny events in search of an ending, but it was mostly because they simply weren't as funny as they could be." ...|$|R
