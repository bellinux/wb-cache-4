5|$|The summit area is {{triangular}} in {{plan with}} ridges {{running to the}} north, south and east. The actual top is toward the northern corner and set back a little from the drop to Nethermost Cove. There is a rash of stones on the summit although the surroundings are mostly covered in rough grass, and several small cairns have been built. Other than northward, where the bulk of Helvellyn intervenes, <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> extensive, {{with much of the}} Lake District visible. Further ground is brought into view from the summit of High Crag.|$|E
25|$|The summit {{carries a}} small cairn on grass. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> {{good with the}} craggy heads of Deepdale and Dovedale in close-up.|$|E
25|$|The {{summit of}} Stone Arthur is {{difficult}} to locate exactly amongst the upthrust rocks of Arthur's Chair. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> excellent, particularly over Grasmere with Easedale Tarn showing across the valley.|$|E
50|$|Third-angle {{is as if}} {{the object}} were a box to be unfolded. If we unfold the box so that <b>the</b> front <b>view</b> <b>is</b> in <b>the</b> center of the two arms, then <b>the</b> top <b>view</b> <b>is</b> above it, <b>the</b> bottom <b>view</b> <b>is</b> below it, <b>the</b> left <b>view</b> <b>is</b> to <b>the</b> left, and <b>the</b> right <b>view</b> <b>is</b> to <b>the</b> right. It is {{standard}} in the USA (ASME Y14.3-2003 specifies it as the default projection system), Japan (JIS B 0001:2010 specifies it as the default projection system), Canada, and Australia.|$|R
2500|$|On 26 and 27 August 2006, <b>the</b> <b>View</b> <b>were</b> {{a last-minute}} {{addition}} to the Reading and Leeds Festivals. The NME reported the fans' chant of “The <b>View,</b> <b>the</b> <b>View</b> <b>are</b> on fire" [...] could be heard ringing loudly around the packed tent. They also played both festivals in 2007.|$|R
5000|$|AspView, a view {{engine that}} uses C# as its {{scripting}} language, {{and uses a}} pre-compiled approach, where all <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>are</b> pre-compiled to a [...]NET Assembly prior to deployment. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> templates <b>are</b> text files with the extension '.aspx'.|$|R
25|$|The view {{includes}} a striking {{window to the}} southwest between Lonscale Fell and Blencathra, revealing unexpectedly a run of high fells from Pillar to Crinkle Crags. Elsewhere, <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> of the nearby fells surrounding Skiddaw Forest.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> {{robbed of}} {{foreground}} by the broad plateau of the summit, but serried ranks of fells appear in all directions. All {{of the principal}} groups {{with the exception of}} the Far Eastern Fells are in sight.|$|E
25|$|The {{summit of}} High Hartsop Dodd bears a small cairn {{at the point}} where the ridge briefly levels out. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> not {{extensive}} given the high ring of surrounding fells, but many of these are seen in close detail, particularly Dove Crag.|$|E
50|$|Joy Behar of <b>The</b> <b>View</b> <b>was</b> once {{a teacher}} at Lindenhurst High School.|$|R
50|$|The {{summit is}} a grassy ridge, {{which has a}} cairn and trig point. <b>The</b> <b>views</b> <b>are</b> {{extensive}} to <b>the</b> south and east, with Plynlimon and Cardigan Bay ahead, while <b>the</b> north <b>views</b> <b>are</b> dominated by Cadair Idris and Maesglase to the west.|$|R
60|$|I {{thought he}} <b>was</b> joking, for <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>was</b> sordid enough, {{but he soon}} {{explained}} himself.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> {{excellent}} {{with all}} of the major fells except the Coniston range in sight. Loweswater and Ennerdale Water can be seen, together with Burnmoor Tarn. From the north windshelter there is a striking view of the summit of Pillar Rock.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> {{good for}} a fell so removed from {{the centre of the}} District. The Scafells are seen in profile, with Helvellyn and Skiddaw in the distance. Ennerdale Water is in view from the summit and Wast Water from the {{southern}} cairn.|$|E
25|$|The small tidy {{summit on}} the highest rock knoll bears a cairn. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> limited by the circle of higher fells, but the vista of Buttermere backed by Great Gable is excellent. Crummock Water can also be brought into view by taking a few paces westward.|$|E
40|$|The {{experience}} of gardens is often analyzed in function of <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>the</b> garden affords. The actual walk leading to <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>is</b> treated as secondary. Yet <b>the</b> <b>views</b> cannot <b>be</b> experienced without the walk. The paper presents {{the paradigm of}} “panorama and labyrinth” to offer an analysis of both aspects of the {{experience of}} a garden...|$|R
50|$|On July 9, 2013, ABC {{confirmed}} that Hasselbeck would <b>be</b> leaving <b>The</b> <b>View</b> to join Fox & Friends. Her last day on <b>The</b> <b>View</b> <b>was</b> July 10, 2013.|$|R
5000|$|Initially <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>was</b> {{taken that}} only punitive {{suspensions}} fell {{within the scope}} of the [...] "unfair labour practice," [...] but this <b>view</b> <b>was</b> rejected by <b>the</b> Labour Court.|$|R
25|$|The {{summit is}} a low rock tower, attractively seen from the {{surrounding}} valleys. There is {{only a very small}} cairn {{due to the lack of}} available stone. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> largely restricted by higher fells, but with the Fairfield and High Street fells well seen.|$|E
25|$|The {{summit of}} Middle Dodd bears a small cairn on a neat grassy top. There {{is also a}} small trench here of {{uncertain}} origin. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> remarkably good given the looming presence of Red Screes, with a distant vista of the Scafells completing the picture.|$|E
25|$|The summit bears a small cairn {{in a sea}} {{of grass}} with the main ridge path {{crossing}} the highest point. Other than north and south where higher fells intervene, <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> good. The subsidiary top of Brown Crag (2,000ft) on the western face also provides fine views of Skiddaw and The Dodds.|$|E
5000|$|Around 1870 <b>the</b> <b>view</b> {{regarding}} parks changed; it was {{now seen}} as a natural task for the city's authorities. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>was</b> that parks had two major good effects: ...|$|R
5000|$|In New Zealand, <b>The</b> <b>View</b> <b>was</b> {{screened}} on <b>the</b> Vibe {{channel on}} Sky satellite television. Episodes are delayed by one week.|$|R
50|$|The last {{episode of}} <b>The</b> <b>View</b> <b>was</b> {{broadcast}} on RTÉ One on 13 December 2011. A new replacement series called The Works replaced <b>The</b> <b>View,</b> beginning on 26 January 2012.|$|R
25|$|The {{historic}} centre of Edinburgh is divided in two by the broad green swathe of Princes Street Gardens. To the south <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> dominated by Edinburgh Castle, built {{high on the}} castle rock, and the long sweep of the Old Town descending towards Holyrood Palace. To the north lie Princes Street and the New Town.|$|E
25|$|In TV shows, one of {{the most}} {{prominent}} showings is in the series Frasier where an outline of it appears in the opening credits and the base of it is visible from the high-rise condo although <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> really a composite image as there are no high rise condos in the right area of that height.|$|E
25|$|Above {{the steep}} faces the {{triangular}} plateau, {{half a mile}} across, is dotted with small tarns. The summit bears the name Dead Pike and carries a large cairn of reddish stone. The best of <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> to the north, Blencathra appearing above Thirlmere. South-west there is a fine mountain panorama stretching {{as far as the}} Coniston Fells.|$|E
50|$|After several {{misfires}} (due to a rescheduling made {{by one of}} {{the three}} men), <b>the</b> <b>viewing</b> <b>was</b> scheduled for 16 November 1943.|$|R
25|$|One of the {{significant}} challenges with PDF accessibility is that PDF documents have three distinct views, which, depending on the document's creation, can be inconsistent with each other. <b>The</b> three <b>views</b> <b>are</b> (i) <b>the</b> physical <b>view,</b> (ii) <b>the</b> tags <b>view,</b> and (iii) <b>the</b> content <b>view.</b> <b>The</b> physical <b>view</b> <b>is</b> displayed and printed (what most people consider a PDF document). <b>The</b> tags <b>view</b> <b>is</b> what screen readers and other assistive technologies use to deliver a high-quality navigation and reading experience to users with disabilities. <b>The</b> content <b>view</b> <b>is</b> based on <b>the</b> physical order of objects within the PDF's content stream and may be displayed by software that does not fully support <b>the</b> tags <b>view,</b> such as <b>the</b> Reflow feature in Adobe's Reader.|$|R
5000|$|All {{objects in}} the ERP are DocTypes (not to be {{confused}} with HTML DocTypes) and <b>the</b> <b>Views</b> <b>are</b> generated directly in the browser.|$|R
25|$|Cockpit {{visibility}} {{is generally}} good other than directly above the aircraft, where <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> {{blocked by the}} wing. This obstruction is of particular concern when, {{as is the case}} with most high-wing aircraft, the inside-turn wing blocks vision in the direction of a turn. As a partial remedy to this some 150s, including all Aerobats, feature a pair of overhead skylights.|$|E
25|$|The summit bears an Ordnance Survey {{triangulation}} column, {{set on a}} stony plateau {{though it}} has recently collapsed. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> excellent, although robbed of some foreground by the flat expanse of the top. All of the major fell groups can be seen with the Scafells particularly fine. Although a higher neighbour, Grasmoor detracts little from the view to the west.|$|E
25|$|The {{summit of}} Catstye Cam {{is small and}} neat, bearing only a tiny cairn. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> {{extensive}} and even the looming Helvellyn only adds to the drama by showing its eastern face in close detail. Striding Edge is also seen in profile across Red Tarn, lines of pilgrims frequently queueing at the bottlenecks. By contrast Catstye Cam is often almost completely deserted.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>views</b> <b>were</b> varied, {{some were}} {{in favour of}} Brunei joining Malaysia, some opposed and some wanted the Sultan to make the decision.|$|R
40|$|Multi-view {{algorithms}} {{reduce the}} amount of required training data by partitioning the domain features into separate subsets or <b>views</b> that <b>are</b> sufficient to learn the target concept. Such algorithms rely on the assumption that <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>are</b> sufficiently compatible for multi-view learning (i. e., most examples are labeled identically in all views). In practice, it is unclear whether or not two <b>views</b> <b>are</b> sufficiently compatible for solving a new, unseen learning task. In order to cope with this problem, we introduce a view validation algorithm: given a learning task, the algorithm predicts whether or not <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>are</b> sufficiently compatible for solving that particular task. We use information acquired while solving several exemplar learning tasks to train a classifier that discriminates between the tasks for which <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>are</b> sufficiently and insufficiently compatible for multi-view learning. Our experiments on wrapper induction and text classification show that view validation requires only a modest amount of training data to make high accuracy predictions...|$|R
