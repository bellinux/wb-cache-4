40|$|This Master’s Thesis {{presents}} a privacy scheme for anonymous RFID payments applied to <b>the</b> car <b>toll</b> <b>context.</b> <b>The</b> scheme enables a fast and convenient way of collecting car toll, requiring no interaction between <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> and <b>the</b> car owner. Meanwhile, an anonymous and untraceable payment solution is provided. Additional properties {{given by the}} protocol are protection for the tag carrier against replay attacks and forged payments {{as well as the}} possibility to challenge invalid transactions. The payment scheme is based on RFID technology, providing limited computational resources. As these limitations restricts the cryptographic toolbox available to ensure the security of the scheme, finding a compromise between computational capacity and security has been {{at the heart of the}} work. The payment scheme builds on the pseudonym protocol introduced by David Molnar, Andrea Sopper and David Wagner, making use of pseudo random functions and a back-end system to interpret pseudonyms. Furthermore, we introduce a challenge-response protocol as well as pseudo random function signatures to ensure additional security properties. To formulate possible adversary attacks as well as define security requirements for the system an adversary model is presented. This model also works as a stance for the proofs verifying the same security requirements. Finally, the thesis describes two alternative solutions to <b>the</b> original car <b>toll</b> payment problem as well as an alternative use of our payment scheme within merchandise shopping. In our alternative solutions we change the underlying assumptions as well as making some compromises on the security properties...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} morning commute {{problem with a}} peak period flat <b>toll,</b> where <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> has a maximum {{acceptable}} toll level and a maximum acceptable length of tolling period. Under such a constrained optimization setup, we investigate the system cost minimization problem. A tolling scheme is determined by <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> starting time, <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> ending time, and <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> level. <b>The</b> <b>toll</b> starting time and ending time are set {{before and after the}} common work start time, respectively. We find out that, under <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> window length constraint only, a balanced toll window design is always optimal, where “balanced” means that the part of <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> window before <b>the</b> work start time and the part after have equal monetary value. Under both <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> level and <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> window length constraints, the balanced design is optimal if feasible; otherwise <b>the</b> <b>toll</b> should start later with <b>the</b> same <b>toll</b> window length...|$|R
