Double-stator {{switched}} reluctance machines {{benefit from}} a high torque density and a low radial force level in comparison with conventional switched reluctance machines resulting in a lower vibration and acoustic noise.

40|$|Direct-driven {{permanent}} magnet synchronous generator {{is one of}} the most promising topologies for megawatt-range wind power applications. The rotational speed of the direct-driven generator is very low compared with the traditional electrical machines. The low rotational speed requires high torque to produce megawatt-range power. The special features of the direct-driven generators caused by the low speed and high torque are discussed in this doctoral thesis. Low speed and high torque set high demands on the <b>torque</b> <b>quality.</b> The cogging torque and the load torque ripple must be as low as possible to prevent mechanical failures. In this doctoral thesis, various methods to improve the <b>torque</b> <b>quality</b> are compared with each other. The rotor surface shaping, magnet skew, magnet shaping, and the asymmetrical placement of magnets and stator slots are studied not only by means of <b>torque</b> <b>quality,</b> but also the effects on the electromagnetic performance and manufacturability of the machine are discussed. The heat transfer of the direct-driven generator must be designed to handle the copper losses of the stator winding carrying high current density and to keep the temperature of the magnets low enough. The cooling system of the direct-driven generator applying the doubly radial air cooling with numerous radial cooling ducts was modeled with a lumped-parameter-based thermal network. The performance of the cooling system was discussed during the steady and transient states. The effect of the number and width of radial cooling ducts was explored. The large number of radial cooling ducts drastically increases the impact of the stack end area effects, because the stator stack consists of numerous substacks. The effects of the radial cooling ducts on the effective axial length of the machine were studied by analyzing the crosssection of the machine in the axial direction. The method to compensate the magnet end area leakage was considered. The effect of the cooling ducts and the stack end area effects on the no-load voltages and inductances of the machine were explored by using numerical analysis tools based on the three-dimensional finite element method.

50|$|There {{also some}} {{alternative}} {{options in the}} way of interceptors like # Unichip that clamp the various inputs to the standard management systems, but they are restricted by the fact that fuel delivery generally cannot be easily increased as manipulation of the air-flow meter input and/or aggressive modifying of the ignition timing causes the Check Engine Light (CEL) to illuminate easily due to a deviation between the expected and targeted <b>torque</b> and <b>quality</b> of emissions.It is therefore common to increase the fuel pressure across the board by using an aftermarket fuel pressure regulator when tuning is performed by these interceptor computers, and trim the fuel out instead. However, increased fuel pressure has the side-effect of affecting the engine's ability to idle due to injector lockup, and as such sometimes an alternative solution of additional injectors instead of a raised-fuel-pressure regulator is proposed.The number of cars with such complex requirements is very low, and in general a full aftermarket engine management system is used in these cases, such as Nira or MoTeC.|$|R

40|$|A novel {{method to}} {{calculate}} the harmonic torque components in synchronous machines is presented. Harmonic torque components create a torque ripple, which is undesirable in many applications. This torque ripple is {{a major cause of}} acoustic noise and vibration and can limit the machine's application range. A seminumerical method is developed to calculate and analyze harmonic torque components based on Maxwell stress tensor theory. Development of the Maxwell stress expressions leads to a simple algebraic expression for the calculation. Finite-element (FE) analysis is used to determine the equation variables.

40|$|The direct {{torque control}} {{approach}} called model predictive direct torque control (MP-DTC) is extended to field-weakening operation in this research. The controller {{is of the}} finite control set (FCS) type, which takes the discrete states of the voltage source inverter (VSI) into account. Each sampling period, the future behavior of the plant is predicted and inputs (voltage vectors) are selected using an optimization criterion, i. e., a cost function. Optimization, however, depend on the operation region. Maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) tracking for high electrical efficiency is aimed below rated speed, operation off the MTPA trajectory is necessary for obtaining field-weakening. In this work, a cost function is designed, which is suitable for operation at high speeds without penalizing operation below rated speed. MP-DTC is applied to permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) drive systems. High control performances, i. e., dynamics, is obtained without increasing the switching frequency nor reducing significantly the <b>torque</b> <b>quality.</b> This feature is interesting above all for high power applications.

In this paper the performance of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for stator flux linkage estimation is studied. Starting from a formulation of the EKF for isotropic motors, the influence of rotor anisotropy and saturation is evaluated. Subsequently it is expanded to highly isotropic motors as well.

40|$|Two methods, both {{based on}} the concept of {{combustion}} net torque, for estimation of combustion properties using measurements of crankshaft torque data are investigated in this work. The first of the proposed methods estimates entire burned mass fraction traces from corresponding combustion net torque traces.

The other proposed estimation method estimates the well established combustion phasing measure referred to as 50 % burned mass fraction directly from combustion net torque using a nonlinear black-box mapping. The methods are assessed using both simulations and experimental data gathered from a 5 -cylinder light-duty diesel engine equipped with a crankshaft torque sensor and cylinder pressure sensors that are used for reference measurements.

40|$|This paper explores {{some key}} {{electromagnetic}} design {{aspects of a}} synchronous reluctance motor which is equipped with single tooth windings (i. e. fractional slot-concentrated windings). The analyzed machine, a 6 slot 4 pole motor, utilizes a segmented stator core structure for ease of coil winding, pre-assembly and facilitation of high slot fill factors (~ 60 %). The impact on the motors torque producing capability and its power factor of these inter-segment air-gaps between the stator segments is investigated through 2 D FEA studies where it is shown {{that they have a}} low impact.

40|$|The paper {{studies the}} impact of first and third current-harmonic {{repartition}} in a five-phase Permanent Magnet machine whose Electromotive Forces (emfs) have first and third harmonics of the same amplitude. With a five-phase machine, {{it is possible for}} the torque production to achieve independent controls of the first and third harmonics of currents by using a vector control in each one of the two characteristic orthogonal sub-spaces of the machine. The same <b>torque</b> <b>quality</b> as obtained with a three-phase machine with sinusoidal emf can be thus obtained with a non-sinusoidal emf and with one more supplementary degree of freedom for the control. Based on the Maximum Torque Per Ampere (MTPA) strategy used for three-phase machines, a comparison of the obtained torque/speed characteristics of the machine is achieved using either one or two harmonics. The voltage limits imposed by the Voltage Source Inverter and two different values of the maximum allowed current densities are taken into account for obtaining the optimum repartition between first and third harmonics of currents: it appears that at first, {{from the point of view}} of efficiency, the MTPA is not optimal except for low speeds and secondly that the repartition of currents is not trivial and depends for example on the considered maximum current densities...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{methods are}} widely used and well {{understood}} for determining the torque or force in machines which do not contain permanent magnets. Energy methods are employed to calculate torques or forces of magnetic origin after determination of the energy stored in the electromechanical coupling field. In this thesis, the energy stored in a permanent magnet system is defined, and the energy-coenergy relationship is determined. It is shown how residual magnetism {{can be incorporated into}} classical electromechanical coupling theory. It is therefore shown how equations for torques or forces can be derived for permanent magnet systems using energy methods. An analytical method of calculating permanent magnet reluctance torque is developed. The method uses an elementary expression for the magnetic field to obtain the stored energy. This enables an analytical expression for the reluctance torque waveform to be obtained. The method is demonstrated to provide a powerful and fast design tool. The method can be generally applied to reluctance torque problems where the airgap is reasonably smooth. The single phase synchronous permanent magnet motor is used in domestic appliances. It is a motor of very simple construction and high reliability, which is directly connected to an AC mains supply, and runs at synchronous speed. It is becoming increasingly used in preference to the shaded pole induction motor. However, its application is limited by the following characteristics. There is no control over the final direction of rotation, unless a mechanical blocking device is used. There are rotor positions at which only a very small starting torque is available. The characteristic twice electrical frequency torque pulsation yields a speed modulation of the same frequency, which can cause acoustic noise problems. A method of improving <b>torque</b> <b>quality</b> by improving the motor design is proposed to alleviate these limiting characteristics. This is achieved by designing a permanent magnet reluctance torque which cancels out the effect of the backward rotating component of the stator field. In this novel design, the permanent magnet reluctance torque effectively acts as a second balancing phase. An unconventional technique for starting a single phase synchronous permanent magnet motor is demonstrated. This technique uses an inductive reluctance torque, provided by placing a suitably shaped iron lamination on the rotor, to rotate the rotor to a position from which starting can occur...|$|E

40|$|The {{permanent}} magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) {{is an interesting}} alternative for an electric motor drive system in automotive applications, due to to the high efficiency requirement; as only {{a limited amount of}} energy can be stored in the relatively expensive battery. Another advantage is the high torque and power density a PMSM can achieve since {{it is very important to}} save especially space but also weight in vehicle applications. As the battery technology develops, pure electric cars are expected to become a more and more interesting alternative. It is then natural that the requirement of reliability on the electric drive system becomes an aspect of utmost importance as the electric drive is the only driving force. In this thesis, a fault-tolerant fractional slot PMSM is designed and its capability to operate even after a fault occurs is investigated. The faults investigated are phase open circuit and phase short circuit, and it is shown that the thesis machine design can be operated during both circumstances. The fault-tolerant thesis machine design is compared with two reference machines; one existing PMSM design of the same size and a smaller prototyped PMSM, also including measurements for the later. All three machines are evaluated both during normal and during phase open circuit operation, using amethod where the remaining two phase currents are rearranged in order to get constant currents in the rotating dq reference frame. It is found that themaximum torque is reduced to approximately 58 % and the maximum speed to roughly 1 / 2, in relation to what is achievable for each machine during normal operation. The thermal limits are investigated and shown to follow the electrical limits for the thesis design and for the prototyped IPM machine. However, when this method is used, it is noticed that the <b>torque</b> <b>quality</b> might be reduced significantly. A semi-analytical machine modeling approach is introduced and used to model the individual saturation levels of the phases.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{comprehensively}} {{dedicated to the}} theoretical and experimental reevaluation of the Synchronous Reluctance Machine (SynRM). A simple approach to derive the SynRM main characteristics and behavior is followed. An introduction to {{an evaluation of the}} different control strategies in is given. Finding suitable rotor geometry for the SynRM has been a subject for major investigation since 1923. This thesis will investigate the interior barrier rotor structure of the SynRM using the Finite Element Method (FEM) based sensitivity analysis. The Permanent Magnet assisted SynRM (PMaSynRM) is studied. The main aim here is to address accurately, qualitatively and quantitatively the main characteristics of such a machine. A heat-run test has been done on a prototyped SynRM and its corresponding IM and Interior Permanent Magnet (IPM) Machine to investigate the potential of the SynRM, under variable speed drive (VSD) supply conditions. This gives the state-ofart based on these measurements on the prototype SynRM and benchmarks its performance. The main behavior and characteristics of an anisotropic structure, suitable for high performance SynRM rotor geometry design, is distinguished and discussed. The carefully selected general rotor shape and some optimum distribution rules are used to develop a novel FEM-aided fast rotor design optimization for SynRM. Torque ripple minimization of SynRM is discussed. This is done by the development of a general method that minimizes the ripple independent of the stator structure. The torque ripple and interconnection to iron losses are briefly discussed. Based on these design tools, a design that is a compromise between the final machine?s performance and simplicity of the rotor structure is studied as the improved machine design. The fine tuned most promising design is prototyped and its performance compared with IM. Naturally, to have an anisotropic structure the q-axis flux must be blocked and simultaneously the d-axis flux must flow smoothly. One possibility is to align the barrier edges along the d-axis natural flux lines in the solid rotor. A prototype of the final optimized machine design SynRM is manufactured. The performance of this machine is measured and compared with the improved machine design. The effect of the number of poles on SynRM performance is discussed. Some of the most important secondary effects in SynRM are studied. Skew and <b>torque</b> <b>quality,</b> the possible effects of alternative voltage or current source supplies on torque and iron losses, the start-up and short-circuit locked rotor tests performed on the standard IM and the prototype SynRM and the effect of eccentricity are investigated.

40|$|Within {{the context}} of {{impedance}} controlled exoskeletons, common actuators have important drawbacks. Either the actuators are heavy, have a complex structure or are poor torque sources, due to gearing or heavy nonlinearity. Considering our application, an impedance controlled gait rehabilitation robot for treadmill-training, we de-signed an actuation system that might avoid these drawbacks. It combines a lightweight joint and a simple structure with adequate <b>torque</b> source <b>quality.</b> It consists of a servomotor, a flexible Bowden cable transmission, and a force feedback loop based on a series elas-tic element. A basic model was developed that is shown to describe the basic dynamics of the actuator well enough for design purpose. Further measurements show that performance is sufficient {{for use in a}} gait rehabilitation robot. The demanded force tracking band-widths were met: 11 Hz bandwidth for the full force range (de-manded 4 Hz) and 20 Hz bandwidth for smaller force range (de-manded 12 Hz). The mechanical output impedance of the actuator could be reduced to hardly perceptible level. Maxima of about 0. 7 Nm peaks for 4 Hz imposed motions appeared, corresponding to less than 2. 5 % of the maximal force output. These peaks were caused by the stick friction in the Bowden cables. Spring stiffness variation showed that both a too stiff and a too compliant spring can worsen performance. A stiff spring reduces the maximum allowable controller gain. The relatively low control gain then causes a larger effect of stick in the force output, resulting in a less smooth output in general. Low spring stiffness, on the other side, decreases the performance of the system, because saturation will occur sooner.
