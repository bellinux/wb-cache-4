In 1996, an estimated 505, 514 females aged < 20 years gave birth; two thirds of births to <b>teenagers</b> are unintended (3).

40|$|Background - Understanding food choice {{behavior}} in adolescence {{is important because}} many core eating habits may be tracked into adulthood. The food choices of at least 2. 3 % of <b>teenagers</b> living in the United Kingdom are determined by food allergies. However, the effect of food allergies on eating habits in <b>teenagers</b> {{has not yet been}} studied. Objective - To provide an understanding of how <b>teenagers</b> with food allergies make food choice decisions and how these differ from those of non–food-allergic <b>teenagers.</b> Methods - One focus group discussion with non–food-allergic <b>teenagers</b> (n = 11) and 14 semistructured interviewers (7 with food-allergic and 7 with non–food-allergic <b>teenagers)</b> were performed (age range, 12 - 18 years). The focus group discussion and interviews were audiorecorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic content analysis. Results - <b>Teenagers</b> from both groups (food-allergic and non–food-allergic) named sensory characteristics of foods as the main reason for choosing them. Some food-allergic <b>teenagers</b> downplayed their allergy and frequently engaged in risk-taking {{behavior in}} terms of their food choices. However, they reported difficulties in trying new foods, especially when away from home. Parental control was experienced as protective by those with food allergies, whereas non–food-allergic <b>teenagers</b> felt the opposite. Most <b>teenagers,</b> including food-allergic ones, expressed the wish to eat similar foods to their friends. Other themes did not vary between the 2 groups. Conclusion - Food-allergic <b>teenagers</b> strive {{to be able to make}} similar food choices to their friends, although differences to non–food-allergic <b>teenagers</b> exist. It is important to address these differences to improve their dietary management...|$|R

However, it is necessary to examine not only the way to support inside a particular place but also the function of this support in a whole out-of-school space including <b>teenagers</b> who refuse the support by adults. In this paper I tried to make clear the structure and function of out-of-school support through an analysis of the relationship and interaction among facilitators, <b>teenagers</b> who take advantage of facilitators'support and <b>teenagers</b> who refuse them. I adopted ethnography as a research method, which aims to describe the culture of others. The fields I observed are one of the facilities for <b>teenagers,</b> 'Yu-Suginami'and its neighborhood. What I found out through the ethnography are the following. Yu-Suginami is used by many and various types of <b>teenagers</b> because of 'casual and conscious support for each <b>teenager's</b> needs'by staff members. But some <b>teenagers</b> refuse the facilities because of 'pedagogical action to deviation'by staff members.

The influence of deficits in social interaction and stigma was examined through semi-structured interviews and focus groups, comprised of groups with <b>teenagers</b> with ASD and groups with typically developing <b>teenagers.</b> It was found that for typical <b>teenagers,</b> extracurricular activities are the basis for creating and maintaining friendships. <b>Teenagers</b> with ASD are less involved in extracurricular activities and also have more difficulty identifying friends desire more friends.
