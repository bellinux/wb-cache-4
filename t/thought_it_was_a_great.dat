25|$|Sydney trainer Harry Telford persuaded American {{businessman}} David J. Davis to buy {{the colt}} at auction, based on his pedigree. Telford's brother Hugh, who lived in New Zealand, was asked to bid up to 190 guineas at the 1928 Trentham Yearling Sales. When the horse was obtained for a mere 160 guineas, he <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> bargain until the colt arrived in Australia. The horse was gangly, his face was covered with warts, and he had an awkward gait. Davis was furious {{when he saw the}} colt as well, and refused to pay to train the horse. Telford had not been particularly successful as a trainer, and Davis was one of his few remaining owners. To placate Davis, he agreed to train the horse for nothing, in exchange for a two-thirds share of any winnings. Telford leased the horse for three years and was eventually sold joint ownership by Davis.|$|E

DeGeneres was followed by car to the studio on at least one occasion by a [...] "suspicious man". Some within the entertainment industry assumed that the coming out was simply a ratings stunt, to which DeGeneres responded, [...] "I did it selfishly for myself and because I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> thing for the show, which desperately needed a point of view." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} greeted with {{widespread}} derision in preview screenings. An audience of Los Angeles entertainment journalists, critics, and others greeted the film with guffaws and hoots at a screening in Century City while other viewers in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore responded with derisive laughter or simply walked out. At a post-launch publicity event, Travolta, on asking assembled journalists if they had enjoyed it, received no reply. He later asserted that other filmmakers had enjoyed the movie: [...] "When I felt better about everything was when George Lucas and Quentin Tarantino, {{and a lot of}} people that I felt knew what they were doing, saw it and <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> piece of science fiction." [...] Christian also spoke of an initially positive reception, mentioning an enthusiastic response from both the audience and Tarantino.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{were looking}} for an actor who could portray Silver as a [...] "quirky kid who moves to her own beat". Sachs explained that Jessica Stroup [...] "came in dressed for the part, artsy and quirky, and she had her hair up {{and she had a}} bandana. She nailed it." [...] The producers were fans of Tristan Wilds for his acting on The Wire, and hoped to hire him as Dixon from the start of casting. When asked about Michael Steger, who portrays Navid, Sachs said [...] "he's just great". Rob Estes, the last actor to join the series, was a previous cast member of the first Beverly Hills, 90210 spin-off, Melrose Place. Estes was sought by The CW to play Harry, but was contracted on the drama Women's Murder Club. When that series was canceled, Sachs called Estes and explained the spin-off to him, and he <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> idea. Sachs promised that although he was playing a parent, he would not [...] "be furniture... as in the seldom seen or heard parents who populate many youth-centric series, like the Walsh parents on the original 90210." ...|$|E
500|$|Gillian Anderson was {{particularly}} {{pleased with the}} episode showing a different side of Scully and said, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> idea. I personally {{was going through a}} dark period at the time, and I wanted to explore Scully's dark side. For some reason, Glen and Jim were on the same wavelength that week. Afterward, a lot of people told me that on that episode I was so 'unlike' Scully or that 'it showed my range'. I told them I thought they were wrong. I don't think that what I did here was out of character for Scully. The only thing different is that the audience hadn't seen it before." [...] Initially, Anderson called up Morgan and asked him to write a story wherein Scully [...] "fall hard" [...] for another man, which leads to an [...] "intense kind of romantic or passionate relationship". Morgan obliged and wrote a scene where Scully enjoys a passionate night with Jerse. This was later removed from the script by series creator Chris Carter, the only time in Glen Morgan's tenure on the show where a scene of his was removed by Carter. Morgan later noted [...] "I think Chris thought that I was monkeying around with him, but I really wasn't." ...|$|E

Arturo Rawson took power as de facto president. The nature of the coup was confusing during its first days: German embassy officials <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> pro-Allied coup and burned their documentation, while the United States embassy <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> pro-Nazi coup.|$|R

500|$|The party scenes {{sought to}} {{illustrate}} Jesse's internal guilt and self-hatred for having murdered Gale Boetticher {{in the third}} season finale, [...] "Full Measure". Bryan Cranston praised these scenes, saying, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> way to show a person going through a private hell. That everybody suffers, deals with their own personal loss in many different ways." [...] Although the previous episode, [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub", also featured similar party scenes, the party was much darker and more decrepit in [...] "Open House", and Breaking Bad music supervisor Thomas Golubic tried to select music appropriate for that darker tone. Originally he tried using variations of punk rock, hip hop and dubstep, but felt it was inappropriate and wanted something that [...] "deeper into Jesse's headspace". He chose the song [...] "If I Had a Heart" [...] by Swedish musician Fever Ray which was used during a sequence of scenes before and during Jesse's party. Golubic said he liked the [...] "muted loud sort of feel" [...] of the song, which he felt matched Jesse's frame of mind and the [...] "full, heavy darkness" [...] of the party. It was chosen by a vote among the writers among four possible songs.|$|E
500|$|Discussing her own {{reaction}} to the storyline, Smith has commented; [...] "I was psyched. I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> idea." [...] She revealed that the writers have not fully divulged Hahn's romantic backstory to her, explaining; [...] "a {{lot of it is}} still vague. I mean, there's what the writers think and what I've sort of thought, and in my mind. Maybe I had a crush in high school or in college or something— there was something, but I don't think it's ever— I think it might be her first time." [...] Continuing with this theme, Smith also spoke with Kristin Dos Santos for E! about her character's lack of definitive romantic history, jesting; [...] "I'll look at the script next week and be like [...] "Oh my God, I've been a lesbian for years and I didn't know." [...] She also discussed the meetings with GLAAD she and Ramirez attended, and their impact on her portrayal of the storyline, explaining: [...] "It was actually very helpful because they did talk about their own personal lives, and how, I guess if you're an open person, and life is change, then anything can happen. And it could really rock your world I imagine, if you all of a sudden thought that you might be in love with a woman and maybe you weren't before." ...|$|E
500|$|The party scenes at Jesse's house {{sought to}} {{illustrate}} Jesse's internal guilt and self-hatred for having murdered Gale Boetticher {{in the third}} season finale, [...] "Full Measure". Gilligan said these scenes were written {{because he wanted to}} demonstrate that the actions of the characters in Breaking Bad have major consequences. The writing staff spent weeks discussing how Jesse would react to having killed Gale, and went with the course of events in [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub" [...] in part because they felt it would be the most unexpected for the audience. Bryan Cranston praised these scenes, saying [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> way to show a person going through a private hell. That everybody suffers, deals with their own personal loss in many different ways." [...] The scenes were shot on a set in a sound stage built by production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin. Although scenes in Jesse's house are occasionally filmed in an actual house, these particular scenes could not be shot there because the party was so messy. Breaking Bad music supervisor Thomas Golubic tried to select music appropriate for both the party and Jesse's state of mind, using variations of punk rock, hip hop and dubstep. During one scene when Jesse, Skinny Pete and Badger are snorting meth together, Badger leans down outside of the shot to take the drugs, then Skinny Pete pops back up in a match cut. The shot was conceived by MacLaren during filming.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the acclaim lavished on the song, some of Wilson's pop and rock contemporaries have been tempered in their praise of [...] "Good Vibrations". When asked about the song in 1990, Paul McCartney responded: [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> record. It didn't quite have the emotional thing that Pet Sounds had for me. I've often played Pet Sounds and cried. It's {{that kind of an}} album for me." [...] Pete Townshend of the Who was quoted in the 1960s as saying, [...] "'Good Vibrations' was probably a good record but who's to know? You had to play it about 90 bloody times to even hear what they were singing about." [...] Townshend feared that the single would lead to a trend of overproduction. In a 1966 issue of Arts Magazine, Jonathan King said: [...] "With justification, comments are being passed that 'Good Vibrations' is an inhuman work of art. Computerized pop, mechanized music. Take a machine, feed in various musical instruments, add a catch phrase, stir well, and press seven buttons. It is long and split. ... impressive, fantastic, commercial—yes. Emotional, soul-destroying, shattering—no." [...] In the 2000s, record producer Phil Spector criticized the single for depending too much on tape manipulation, negatively referring to it as an [...] "edit record ... It's like Psycho is a great film, but it's an 'edit film.' Without edits, it's not a film; with edits, it's a great film. But it's not Rebecca ... it's not a beautiful story." ...|$|E
500|$|Stone {{met with}} Tom Cruise about playing Bud Fox, but the {{director}} had already committed to Charlie Sheen for the role. Stone liked the [...] "stiffness" [...] of Sheen's acting style {{and used it}} to convey Bud's naivete. Michael Douglas had just come off heroic roles like the one in Romancing the Stone and was looking for something dark and edgy. The studio wanted Warren Beatty to play Gekko, but he was not interested. Stone initially wanted Richard Gere but the actor passed, so Stone went with Douglas despite having been advised by others in Hollywood not to cast him. Stone remembers, [...] "I was warned by everyone in Hollywood that Michael couldn't act, that he was a producer more than an actor and would spend all his time in his trailer on the phone". Nevertheless, Stone found out that [...] "when he's acting he gives it his all". Stone said that he saw [...] "that villain quality" [...] in Douglas and always thought he was a smart businessman. Douglas remembers that when he first read the screenplay, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> part. It was a long script, and there were some incredibly long and intense monologues to open with. I’d never seen a screenplay where there were two or three pages of single-spaced type for a monologue. I thought, whoa! I mean, it was unbelievable". For research, he read profiles of corporate raiders T. Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn.|$|E
500|$|While {{his group}} escapes from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, Jenner whispers to Rick about {{the virus that}} has caused the zombie apocalypse. Initially there was no {{indication}} as to what Jenner said to him; the dialogue was previously inserted into the episode's script but was later removed. [...] "I'm so pleased they didn't reveal it," [...] said Andrew Lincoln, [...] "because it was scripted, and extremely powerful, and I said to everyone, 'Burn this page: No one should know apart from Rick and Frank.' It's brilliant that they left it —it's perfect, it's so classy." [...] Kirkman was content with the idea of teasing Jenner's revelation in lieu of blatantly revealing anything about the origins of the virus. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> addition. I'm very much opposed to showing what the actual cause [...] is and explaining how things work, but teasing a little bit is a great thing. If it adds an extra layer to the drama, then I'm all for it," [...] he stated. [...] "It also led up to the fantastic mystery of the whisper Jenner gives to Rick {{at the end of that}} scene. That's going to play into Season 2 quite a bit. I know where that's going and it's really a cool bit." [...] It is not until the second season finale, [...] "Beside the Dying Fire", that Rick reveals Jenner's message to the group.|$|E

500|$|Bryan Singer {{first read}} Apt Pupil {{when he was}} 19 years old, and {{when he became a}} director, he wanted to adapt the novella into a film. In 1995, Singer asked his friend and screenwriter Brandon Boyce to write a spec script {{adapting}} the novella. [...] Boyce recalled the writing process, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> stageplay, actually... two people, pretty much in a house talking. [...] My script was completely on spec, so, if it didn't work out, at least I'd have a writing sample." [...] When the original option to the novella expired in 1995, Stephen King sued to get the rights back. Singer and Boyce then provided to King a first draft of their script and a copy of Singer's film The Usual Suspects (1995), which had yet to be publicly released. Impressed with Singer, King optioned the rights to the director for $1, arranging to be compensated when the film was released. Singer said of King's ultimate response to the film, despite some changes made to the source material, [...] "Stephen loved it. He seemed to think I captured the mood of the piece." [...] The director appreciated being able to make a Stephen King horror film but with less supernatural terror and more character-driven terror. Singer spoke of his goal: [...] "There {{have been a lot of}} fun horror movies like Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream, and I Know What You Did Last Summer. But I miss movies like The Shining, The Exorcist, and The Innocents by Jack Clayton, so this is a movie sort of in the spirit of the real horror movie." ...|$|E
500|$|The next {{race was}} the Breeders' Cup Classic on November 1. Because many leading older horses retired in 2014, {{most of the}} main contenders for the 2014 Classic were the three year olds: in {{addition}} to California Chrome, former foes Bayern, Candy Boy and Tonalist entered. His chief rival {{was considered to be}} the then-undefeated American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt, Shared Belief, a gelding who missed the Triple Crown series due to hoof problems; the two had never faced each other. California Chrome was 4-1 on the morning line, second favorite to Shared Belief. In the race, Bayern bumped into Shared Belief at the start, then took the lead {{for the duration of the}} race. California Chrome was clear of traffic, maintained third place for most of the race, was closing at the end, and finished a very close third, only a neck behind winner Bayern, who won by a nose over second-place finisher Toast of New York. Shared Belief was fourth. Post race analysis noted that California Chrome stayed on the outside throughout the race, and actually ran 44 feet farther than the winner. [...] Sherman spoke in positive terms of the horse's finish, stating, [...] "My horse ran his eyeballs out. He was right there, right down to the money. I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> effort. He came back strong." [...] Espinoza was less enthusiastic: [...] "On the backstretch I thought I had a chance to win... The last sixteenth [...] was digging as hard as he could, but getting just a little tired. I wish he had one more race. It was a little too much for him today." [...] Coburn visited the colt the following day and stated, [...] "He was full of himself. I think he thought he won. And if the race had been just a little bit longer, I believe he would have." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{record is}} highly {{regarded}} {{among the members}} of U2. Mullen said, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> record. I was very proud of it. Its success was by no means preordained. It was a real break from what we had done before and we didn't know if our fans would like it or not." [...] Bono called the album a [...] "pivot point" [...] in the band's career, saying, [...] "Making Achtung Baby is the reason we're still here now." [...] Clayton concurred, saying, [...] "If we hadn't done something we were excited about, that made us apprehensive and challenged everything we stood for, then there would really have been no reason to carry on... If it hadn't been a great record by our standards, the existence of the band would have been threatened." [...] The group's reinvention occurred {{at the peak of the}} alternative rock movement, when the genre was achieving widespread mainstream popularity. Bill Flanagan pointed out that many of U2's 1980s contemporaries struggled commercially with albums released after the turn of the decade. He argued that U2, however, were able to take advantage of the alternative rock movement and ensure a successful future by [...] "set themselves up as the first of the new groups rather than the last of the old". Toby Creswell echoed these sentiments in his 2006 music reference book 1001 Songs, writing that the album helped U2 avoid [...] "becoming parodies of themselves and being swept aside by the grunge and techno revolutions". AllMusic called the album [...] "a pivotal moment for dance-rock, happening late in the game but showing that even the biggest young band in the world had an eye on the dancefloor". A 2010 retrospective by Spin said that [...] "U2 became the emblematic band of the alternative-rock era with Achtung Baby." ...|$|E
