40|$|Objective: We {{aimed to}} assess {{relationship}} between the severity of coronary atherosclerosis assessed by SYNTAX score (SS) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI. Methods: After accounting for exclusion criteria, a total of 291 patient with STEMI in whom primary percutaneous coronary intervention was performed were retrospectively included (216 male, 75 female; mean age 61. 6 + 14. 0 years). Total and differential leukocyte counts and other biochemical markers were measured at admission. Patients were categorized into tertiles {{on the basis of}} SS. Monitoring for major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) was performed during the in hospital follow-up period. Results: The SS high group leukocyte (p= 0. 009), neutrophil (p= 0. 008), NLR (p= 0. 048), peak troponin (p< 0. 001), peak CK-MB (p= 0. 001) lactate dehydrogenase (p= 0. 005), aspartate aminotransferase (p= 0. 004) values were significantly higher compared with SSlow and SSmid groups. SS was increased, left ventricular ejection fraction was decrease (p< 0. 001) and left ventricular systolic diameter was increased (p= 0. 007). The in-hospital death rate and MACEs were greater in <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>SS</b> <b>group</b> than in the other groups (p< 0. 001 both of). Conclusion: We found that high NLR was significantly and correlated increased with SS. In addition, high SS were significantly associated with increased in-hospital MACE and in-hospital death. Further prospective studies assessing the predictive role of both SS and NLR in conjunction for risk stratification might improve risk prediction in patients with STEMI.
