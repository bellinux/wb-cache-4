5|$|Homer {{comes across}} an {{advertisement}} {{in the newspaper}} for a free <b>trampoline.</b> He rushes to the address from the advertisement, where Krusty is giving it away, and brings it home. Bart and Lisa are thrilled, but Marge {{is concerned about the}} potential dangers. However, Homer brushes aside her worries; he has grand plans of building a theme park in their backyard, and decides to charge others a fee to use the <b>trampoline.</b> Inevitably, however, people begin to get injured, and Homer accepts Marge's advice {{to get rid of the}} <b>trampoline.</b> After failing at his various attempts to do so, Bart steps in to help, by chaining the <b>trampoline</b> to a pole and waiting for Snake to break the chain and steal it for himself.|$|E

5|$|Real-life {{brothers}} Matt and Jeff Hardy {{formed a}} tag team in 1993 after Jeff's {{debut in the}} <b>Trampoline</b> Wrestling Federation (TWF). The promotion went by several names, and in 1997, it was modernized as the Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (OMEGA). The duo worked in several North Carolinian independent promotions holding the OMEGA Tag Team Championship and NWA 2000 Tag Team Championship.|$|E
5|$|Team GB entered nine gymnasts {{into the}} artistic and <b>trampoline</b> events. Louis Smith, {{in winning the}} bronze medal in the men's pommel horse, became the first ever British gymnast to win an {{individual}} apparatus medal in gymnastics, and the first Briton to win any individual gymnastics medal since Walter Tysall won men's all-around medal in 1908. Laura Jones was originally chosen for the artistic gymnastics but, due to a slipped disc in her back, she {{was replaced by the}} reserve Imogen Cairns.|$|E

40|$|A <b>trampolining</b> {{architecture}} {{is a special}} case and extension of a monad which is useful in implementing multiprogramming. Five <b>trampolining</b> architectures, operating over the range of two <b>trampolining</b> translations, are presented. The effects of the architectures are cumulative. Some increase the breadth of multiprogramming facilities provided. Others demonstrate the potential for more efficient implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of <b>trampolining</b> to languages without closures...|$|R

While Popol, Virginia, and Bluebell manage to make their way across a deep ravine, Bully Bull escapes from jail, and attacks Popol on a steep face. All of them fall down the cliff, but are rescued by firemen with a <b>trampoline,</b> and Bully Bull is once more apprehended.|$|E
5|$|Hardy, {{along with}} his brother Jeff and friends, started their own federation, the <b>Trampoline</b> Wrestling Federation (TWF) and mimicked the moves they saw on television. Shortly after Hardy sent in a tape for the World Championship Wrestling (WCW) Amateur Challenge using the ring name High Voltage, a tag team named High Voltage began {{competing}} in WCW, causing Hardy to change his name to Surge. A few years later, it was revealed to him by Chris Kanyon that the tape had been kept in the WCW Power Plant, watched multiple times, and that the name High Voltage was blatantly stolen from it. Beginning in 1994, The Hardys wrestled for several North Carolina-based independent circuit promotions and adapted a number of alter-egos. As The Wolverine, Hardy captured the New England Wrestling Alliance (NEWA) Championship in May 1994. As High Voltage, he teamed with Venom to claim the New Frontier Wrestling Association (NFWA) Tag Team Championship in March 1995. A month later, High Voltage defeated the Willow for the NFWA Championship.|$|E
5|$|Marge and Homer argue {{later that}} night. Homer tells Marge {{that even though}} getting the <b>trampoline</b> was a mistake at least {{he is willing to}} try new things, while she is boring and nags too much. Marge disagrees, but discovers that Bart and Lisa agree with Homer's assessment. She becomes annoyed and stays the night at Patty and Selma's house. While there, she is {{introduced}} to an infomercial featuring self-help guru Brad Goodman, who supposedly can help her with her chronic nagging. After Marge and Homer watch a Brad Goodman video, Marge is more tolerant {{and the two of them}} get along better. Observing how out of control Bart is, they take the family to see Brad Goodman's live lecture in the hopes that it will change him. Bart interrupts the lecture, and Brad Goodman encourages the town to follow Bart's spontaneous attitude. Soon, the whole town begins to act like Bart, which means Bart's rebellious ways are no longer unique, putting him in a slump.|$|E

50|$|Vuly <b>Trampolines</b> {{was founded}} by Joe Andon in 2007, as <b>Trampolines</b> Australia. The company {{initially}} launched from Andon's own room, {{with the help of}} a personal loan from his parents and his personal savings. Andon, a Palestinian who emigrated from Jerusalem to Australia with his parents when he was three years old and began running a marketing firm at the age of 16 before establishing <b>Trampolines</b> Australia. With its products delivered locally in Queensland, the company established its headquarters in Wakerley in 2009, with Andon stating that the move was made to appear more plausible to his clients. In 2010, <b>Trampolines</b> Australia changed its name to Vuly <b>Trampolines,</b> after Vulcan the Roman God of smithery and fire, to enhance its export efforts to the United States.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{development}} of modern <b>trampolines</b> in the USA by George Nissen, Ted Blake was {{a major contributor to}} their nascence in the United Kingdom and in developing International Competition for <b>trampolining.</b>|$|R

25|$|A <b>trampoline</b> is a gymnastic and {{recreational}} device {{consisting of a}} piece of taut, strong fabric stretched over a steel frame using many coiled springs to provide a rebounding force which propels the jumper high into the air. In a <b>trampoline,</b> the fabric is not elastic itself; the elasticity is provided by the springs which connect it to the frame. While the <b>trampoline</b> is an old invention which relied on crude and flawed designs, the modern <b>trampoline</b> was invented by George Nissen and Larry Griswold around 1934.|$|E
25|$|Double mini <b>trampoline</b> {{involves}} a smaller <b>trampoline</b> with a run-up, two scoring moves are performed per routine. Moves cannot be {{repeated in the}} same order on the double-mini during a competition. Skills can be repeated if a skill is competed as a mounter in one routine and a dismount in another. The scores are marked in a similar manner to individual <b>trampoline.</b>|$|E
25|$|Griswold & Nissen worked {{together}} to develop the first prototype <b>trampoline.</b> Later {{they set up a}} company, the Griswold-Nissen <b>Trampoline</b> & Tumbling Company, to manufacture trampolines. However, initially sales were slow and Griswold sold out as his entertainment career was starting to thrive. In 1945, he found that he had to limit his immersion in water for health reasons and so changed his routine to use a <b>trampoline</b> disguised as a swimming pool in his diving act. This allowed him to play a wider variety of venues.|$|E
50|$|Although {{no longer}} {{manufactured}} here, Brentwood became {{the centre of}} <b>trampolining</b> in the United Kingdom between 1965 and 1981 after George Nissen brought the new sport to the town in 1949 and eventually manufactured <b>trampolines</b> in the town, continuing {{to do so for}} many years after they ceased production in the USA for fear of litigation. Ted Blake, a long-term Brentwood resident, was managing director of Nissen UK from its inception until shortly before it closed and became a leading figure worldwide in the development of modern <b>trampolining.</b> Brentwood still has a thriving <b>trampolining</b> community but no longer a local factory.|$|R
50|$|Andon founded Vuly <b>Trampolines</b> {{at the age}} of 18. Using {{money he}} made from his {{marketing}} venture along with a loan from his father, he began the company out of his bedroom. He got the initial idea after running his finger down a list of products before it settled on <b>trampolines.</b> He purchased a container load of the product and set up a website to sell them. Andon began redesigning <b>trampolines</b> with fewer parts and more safety features, eventually manufacturing the ones he sold. Andon expanded Vuly <b>Trampolines</b> internationally with products being sold in Australia, the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Europe.|$|R

25|$|Until 1969, men's <b>trampoline</b> {{was one of}} {{the events}} that {{comprised}} the NCAA gymnastics championships. At that time, the event was removed in order to conform to the international gymnastics itinerary. The NCAA then bestowed a separate national title in <b>trampoline</b> for two years, both won by Michigan.|$|E
25|$|Trampboarding is {{a variant}} of skateboarding that uses a board without the trucks and the wheels on a <b>trampoline.</b> Using the bounce of the <b>trampoline</b> gives height to perform a tricks, whereas in skateboarding {{you need to make}} the height by {{performing}} an ollie. Trampboarding is seen on YouTube in numerous videos.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>trampoline</b> {{competitors}} are highly trained, {{they are also}} attempting to perform complex manoeuvres {{which could lead to}} accidents and falls. Trampolines used in competitions have their springs covered in pads to reduce the chance of injury when landing off the bed. They also have padded end decks, which are the locations that athletes are most likely to fall off the <b>trampoline.</b> The rules for international competitions (updated by FIG in 2006) also require 200mm thick mats on the floor for 2 metres around each <b>trampoline</b> and for there to be four spotters whose task it is to attempt to catch or reduce the impact of an athlete falling {{off the side of the}} <b>trampoline</b> bed. The floor matting rules are typically adopted by national bodies but not always in full; for example in the UK the requirement for National & Regional competition is still 2m but only of 20–25mm matting.|$|E
50|$|Level 3: Jump between <b>trampolines</b> and beware {{the knife}} throwers and fire breathers. In sublevel 3 and 6 the <b>trampolines</b> {{are placed in}} a {{swimming}} pool and the knife throwers and fire breathers are replaced by jumping dolphins.|$|R
50|$|Because <b>trampolines</b> are runtime {{generated}} code, they trigger PaX {{and cause}} the program {{using them to}} be killed. PaX is capable of identifying the setup of <b>trampolines</b> and allowing their execution. This is, however, considered to produce a situation of weakened security.|$|R
