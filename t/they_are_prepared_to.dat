500|$|The {{newly elected}} {{leader of the}} {{opposition}} Labour Party, Harold Wilson, was initially advised by his colleagues to {{have nothing to do with}} Wigg's private dossier on the Profumo rumours. On 21 March, with the press furore over the [...] "missing witness" [...] at its height, the party changed its stance. During a House of Commons debate, Wigg used parliamentary privilege to ask the Home Secretary to categorically deny the truth of rumours connecting [...] "a minister" [...] to Keeler, Rice-Davies and the Edgecombe shooting. He did not name Profumo, who was not in the House. Later in the debate Barbara Castle, the Labour MP for Blackburn, referred to the [...] "missing witness" [...] and hinted at a possible perversion of justice. The Home Secretary, Henry Brooke, refused to comment, adding that Wigg and Castle should [...] "seek other means of making these insinuations if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> substantiate them".|$|E
500|$|The {{team found}} it {{difficult}} to fill the remaining places in the company with Asian performers, especially in the chorus. [...] Four other shows with Asian themes had opened or were in rehearsal in New York, and the demand for the few Asian actors was strong. [...] Kelly and the show's choreographer, Carol Haney, journeyed to cities across the country to seek out talent. [...] Agents were sent to other cities; in Honolulu, they found nightclub singer and native Hawaiian Ed Kenney, who would originate Wang Ta. [...] Meanwhile, in New York, the three producers were visiting dance schools. [...] An advertisement in New York Chinatown newspapers received one response. [...] No formal audition was held in San Francisco's Chinatown, and the only find was Forbidden City nightclub comedian Goro [...] "Jack" [...] Suzuki (who soon changed his name to Jack Soo), who was cast as Frankie Wing, comedian at Sammy Fong's Celestial Bar. [...] The role of Fong proved difficult to cast. [...] Initially, it was given to Larry Storch, a nightclub comic, but during the Boston tryouts, it was given to another Caucasian, Larry Blyden, who was married to Carol Haney, the show's choreographer. [...] The role of Madam Liang, Master Wang's sister-in-law, fell to Juanita Hall, a light-skinned African American who had played a Tonkinese (Vietnamese) woman, Bloody Mary, in South Pacific. Another African-American performer, Diahann Carroll, was considered for the cast but not hired. [...] Rodgers later wrote, [...] "what was important was that the actors gave the illusion of being Chinese. [...] This demonstrates one of the most wonderful things about theatre audiences. [...] People want to believe what they see on a stage, and they will gladly go along with whatever is done to achieve the desired effect. [...] Ask them to accept Ezio Pinza as a Frenchman , Yul Brynner as Siamese and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> meet you nine tenths of the way even before the curtain goes up." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Sunday Independent's editorials {{came out}} {{strongly}} against Martin McGuinness' campaign to become President of Ireland in 2011, claiming McGuiness' IRA past made him unsuitable for the role: [...] "Those who contemplate voting for...

2500|$|Writing in The Nation in 1987, {{journalist}} and author Robert I. Friedman described CAMERA as having been formed {{in the wake of}} Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon [...] "to keep the U.S. press in line," [...] noting that the organization's activities at the time included publishing a newsletter and placing advertisements in The Christian Science Monitor and The New Republic in support of Israel's West Bank settlement policies. [...] According to Friedman, [...] "CAMERA, the A.D.L., AIPAC {{and the rest of the}} lobby don't want fairness, but bias in their favor. And <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> use McCarthyite tactics, as well as the power and money of pro-Israel PACs, to get whatever Israel wants." ...|$|E
2500|$|Animal {{welfare as}} an issue is {{increasingly}} important to the European Union. Although welfare-conscious husbandry can have economic benefits to the farmer, because a happy animal puts on weight more rapidly and will reproduce more easily, {{the mere fact that}} an animal is gaining weight or reproducing does not necessarily indicate a high level of animal welfare. Generally there is a tension between the minimum acceptable level of animal welfare for the consumer, the price of the product, and an acceptable margin for the farmer. [...] This tension is resolved by food labelling that enables the consumer to select the price <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> pay for a given level of animal welfare. [...] So for example, many consumers prefer to buy free range eggs even where these are more expensive than eggs from battery hens. [...] Nowadays, there are various welfare assurance schemes in response to consumer pressure.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{contrast}} is between Emile Blondet and Raoul Nathan. Both are multi-talented men-of-letters. Blondet {{is the natural}} son of the prefect of Alençon and is described as witty but lazy, incurably hesitant, non-partisan, a political atheist, a player of the game of political opinions (along with Rastignac), having the most judicious mind of the day. He marries Madame de Montcornet and eventually becomes a prefect. Nathan is described as half-Jewish and possessing a second-rate mind. Nathan succumbs to the flattery of unscrupulous financiers and does not see that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> bankrupt him to achieve their purposes. Blondet sees what is happening but does not enlighten Nathan. The downfall drives Nathan to attempt suicide by the method of [...] "any poor work-girl". He then sells out {{to the government of}} the day (on Blondet's advice) to secure an income, and returns to living with the actress/courtesan Florine. In the end he accepts the cross of the Legion of Honour (which he formerly satirised) and becomes a defender of the doctrine of heredity.|$|E

The investigation lasted a total of 5 working days. Society keys and email passwords were confiscated and computers were searched. Staff were directed not to enter SFSS property until directed otherwise. [...] In August, a staff member was fired {{as a result of}} the investigation. Directors have outlined in Board meetings on July 26, August 9, and August 23 that they are bound by confidentiality in their collective agreement with CUPE 5396, and cannot disclose the justifications for terminating the employee. However, they have iterated that they had just cause and that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> go to arbitration.
