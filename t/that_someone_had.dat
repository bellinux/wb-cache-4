5|$|Although sign theft {{has always}} been a problem along this highway, thefts reached {{epidemic}} proportions when the pending number change was announced. Within days of the announcement, virtually every US666 sign had been stolen, some for sale on eBay. Officials in Utah reported that five entire sign assemblies had been cut down with a chainsaw and stolen, while New Mexico officials reported that even signs welded to metal posts, as a theft deterrent, had been stolen. Officials speculated from one scene <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> intentionally crashed a car into the sign post to break the welds.|$|E
5|$|Several facts {{point to}} a {{political}} motive behind the assassination. Leontovych's participation in the independence movement, such as commissioning Ukrainian Republic Capella, aimed at promoting Ukraine as an independent state, earned him many enemies. His older daughter Halyna later recalled her father saying, shortly before his death, that he had documents {{to leave the country}} to Romania, and that he had these documents with him among his sheet music during a concert. However, after returning from tea following the concert, Leontovych noticed <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> gone through his papers. His plans to leave the country, along {{with the fact that he}} was killed by a Soviet agent, also indicate political reasons for his death.|$|E
5|$|Somehow King {{walked in}} {{the front door of the}} jail and a few minutes later out the back. King had {{arranged}} with Undersheriff Harry Woods (publisher of the Nugget) to sell the horse he had been riding to John Dunbar, Sheriff Behan's partner in the Dexter Livery Stable. On March 19, King conveniently escaped while Dunbar and Woods were making out the bill-of-sale. Woods claimed <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> deliberately unlocked a secured back door to the jail. The Earps and the townspeople were furious at King's easy escape. Williams was later dismissed from Wells Fargo, leaving behind a number of debts, when it was determined he had been stealing from the company for years.|$|E

5|$|Van Peebles {{and several}} key crew members were armed {{because it was}} {{dangerous}} to {{attempt to create a}} film without the support of the union. One day, Van Peebles looked for his gun, and failed to find it. Van Peebles found out <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> put it in the prop box. When they filmed the scene in which Beetle is interrogated by police, who fire a gun next to both of his ears, it was feared that the real gun would be picked up instead of the prop. While shooting a sequence with members of the Hells Angels, one of the bikers told Van Peebles they wanted to leave; Van Peebles responded by telling them they were paid to shoot until the scene was over. The biker took out a knife and started cleaning his fingernails with it. In response, Van Peebles snapped his fingers, and his crewmembers were standing there with rifles. The bikers stayed to shoot the scene.|$|E
5|$|Brown, though {{disappointed}} {{at being}} scooped, congratulated the Ortiz team on their discovery. He apologized for immediately overshadowing their announcement of Haumea with his announcement of Eris, and explained <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> accessed their data {{and he was}} afraid of being scooped again. Ortiz did not volunteer to say that it had been he who accessed the data. Upon learning from web server records that it was a computer at the Sierra Nevada Observatory that had accessed his observation logs the day before the discovery announcement—logs which included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images—Brown came to suspect fraud. He emailed Ortiz on August 9 and asked for an explanation. Ortiz did not respond, and on August 15 the Caltech team filed a formal complaint with the IAU, accusing the Ortiz team of a serious breach of scientific ethics in failing to acknowledge their use of the Caltech data, and asked the MPC to strip them of discovery status. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating this was merely part of verifying whether they had discovered a new object. Brown began to wonder if the Spanish team had actually identified Haumea at all before they saw his own abstract and telescope log.|$|E

50|$|The scene {{begins with}} the revelation <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> died; however, exactly who has died is a rather obscure matter. Cordelio enters with a message that is {{difficult}} to grasp because all the audience can understand is <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> died based on one person’s words from one kingdom through another’s words, incomprehensible. Smith questions Bayes on the identity of who has died, and Bayes still refuses to reveal the character, even suggesting that “she” may still not be dead.|$|R

25|$|Highspots Inc. {{claimed that}} Flair {{had given them}} the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt as {{collateral}} for the loan. A warrant for Flair's arrest was issued in May 2011 for being held in contempt of court for violating the terms of his settlement with Highspots. If Flair had failed to comply he could have potentially faced 90 days in jail. On June 25, Highspots released a statement over their official Facebook page stating <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> paid Flair's debts.|$|E
25|$|An autopsy {{found that}} the man had died of foul play, {{remarking}} something initially puzzling: ice crystals in blood vessels near his heart. His interior organs also had decayed at a rate far slower than his skin. Pathologists concluded <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> frozen his body after death in an attempt to mislead investigators into believing he died at a later time than he actually did. The man was identified as someone on the periphery of Mafia activities in nearby Rockland County, New York.|$|E

Back in Dallas Barker announced another report of the death of the President, mentioning that it came from a reliable source. Before the network left KRLD's feed for good, Barker first announced, then retracted, a confirmation of Kennedy's death.|$|E
25|$|Later {{investigation}} found <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> called Lieberman's cell {{phone from the}} apartment at 4 a.m. Lieberman does not remember it, but thinks he may have awoken briefly to check his voicemail.

That evening, after the terrorist attacks, {{he was able to}} use his medical credentials to get through the security perimeter and return to their apartment. Since the window had been left open, dust from the towers had accumulated throughout. There were tracks in it from the couple's two kittens, but none from any human.|$|E
25|$|In November 1953, Time {{magazine}} published evidence gathered variously by Kenneth Page Oakley, Sir Wilfrid Edward Le Gros Clark and Joseph Weiner {{proving that}} the Piltdown Man was a forgery and demonstrating that the fossil was {{a composite of}} three distinct species. It consisted of a human skull of medieval age, the 500-year-old lower jaw of an orangutan and chimpanzee fossil teeth. Someone had created the appearance of age by staining the bones with an iron solution and chromic acid. Microscopic examination revealed file-marks on the teeth, and it was deduced from this <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> modified the teeth to a shape more suited to a human diet.|$|E

25|$|He also {{describes}} how his first chronological victim was actually Isaac Morris, the sleazy lawyer and drugs trafficker who anonymously purchased {{the island and}} arranged the invitations on his behalf. Morris was poisoned before Wargrave departed for the island. Wargrave's intention {{is that when the}} police arrive they will find ten bodies, with evidence <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> been alive after each death, but nobody else on the island, and no way to trace the killer through his invitations or preparations. He states that, although there are three clues that could guide the police to the correct killer, he is confident they will be unable to do so and that the mystery will remain unsolved until the confession is retrieved.|$|E

25|$|Inside, Ruetten found Rasmussen dead on {{the living}} room floor, shot three times. There were signs of a struggle, such as a {{porcelain}} vase that had apparently been broken over Rasmussen's head prior to the shooting, a bloody handprint next to the burglar alarm's panic button, and a toppled credenza. It appeared <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> bound her wrists, or tried to, at some point. She had defensive wounds and bore a bruise on her face that appeared to have been inflicted by the muzzle of a gun. The gun had been fired through a quilt, apparently to muffle the sound. The investigating criminalist also observed a bite mark on Rasmussen's arm, and took a swab from it.|$|E

25|$|After {{ending his}} working {{relationship}} with Mr. Couch, Hungerford went to work briefly at the Bank of Whitestown in Oneida County. In May, 1848, he became cashier of the state-chartered Bank of Westfield, owned by his brother Sextus, who served as its president. John learned the banking business during this period. As it is still true today, bankers had to not only be good with numbers but also had {{to pay attention to}} detail: Hungerford excelled at both. According to one contemporary account, on Friday, July 9, 1852, Hungerford noticed <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> passed counterfeit currency, changing a dollar bill into a ten dollar bill. In July 1864, Sextus Hungerford sold the Bank of Westfield to the newly formed First National Bank of Westfield, capitalized at $100,000.00, where he became a director.|$|E
25|$|Hastings, {{while being}} no great detective himself, serves Poirot in many ways. A former British Army officer in World War I, he is brave. He has courage {{and is often}} used by Poirot for {{physical}} duties such as catching and subduing a criminal. Poirot likes to tease Hastings about being dim-witted at times, but he clearly enjoys the Captain's company. In The Mysterious Affair at Styles and The ABC Murders, Hastings plays {{a prominent role in}} the resolution of the mystery, with a casual observation that leads Poirot to the guilty party: In case of the former, by mentioning that Poirot had to straighten some spill holders and ornaments in Styles, he prompts Poirot to realise <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> moved them, causing Poirot to discover a crucial piece of evidence. In case of the latter, he suggests that the error in recipient address of a letter by the murderer was deliberate, thus causing Poirot to realise the murderer had attached greater importance to that particular murder.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on June 17, 1972, Frank Wills, a {{security}} guard at the Watergate Complex, noticed tape covering the latches {{on some of the}} doors in the complex leading from the underground parking garage to several offices (allowing the doors to close but remain unlocked). He removed the tape, thinking nothing of it. But when he returned an hour later and discovered <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> retaped the locks, Wills called the police. Five men were discovered inside the DNC office and arrested. They were Virgilio González, Bernard Barker, James McCord, Eugenio Martínez, and Frank Sturgis, who were charged with attempted burglary and attempted interception of telephone and other communications. On September 15, a grand jury indicted them, as well as Hunt and Liddy, for conspiracy, burglary, and violation of federal wiretapping laws. The five burglars who broke into the office were tried by a jury, Judge John Sirica officiating, and pled guilty or were convicted on January 30, 1973.|$|E
