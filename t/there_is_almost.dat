5|$|The sebaceous glands {{of a human}} fetus secrete a {{substance}} called vernix caseosa, a waxy, translucent white substance coating the skin of newborns. After birth, activity of the glands decreases until <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> no activity during ages 2–6 years, and then increases to a peak of activity during puberty, due to heightened levels of androgens.|$|E
5|$|Within the conch fisheries, one of {{the threats}} to {{sustainability}} {{stems from the fact}} that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> as much meat in large juveniles as there is in adults, but only adult conchs can reproduce, and thus sustain a population. In many places where adult conchs have become rare due to overfishing, larger juveniles and subadults are taken before they ever mate. On a number of islands, subadults provide the majority of the harvest.|$|E

5|$|The Poitevin had {{a slight}} {{increase}} in popularity {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century, and could count approximately 100 farms perpetuating the breed. The association had around 300 members, as well as 83 stallions and 189 mares registered. However, by 2006, the Poitevin was still considered the most endangered French horse breed, with less than 100 births per year and a slightly decreasing population. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> no crossbreeding done with outside breeds, in order to maintain the numbers of purebred stock. In 2008, a second genetic study was conducted in partnership with the Institut national de la recherche agronomique; this study considered the Poitevin and four other French breeds to be endangered. It suggested making these breeds a conservation priority in order to maintain maximum genetic diversity among the French horse population.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the second}} movement, {{there is a}} brief fourteen-bar {{transitional}} passage in E minor for solo violin and strings only. This leads into the lively and effervescent finale, the whole of which is in E major and whose opening {{is marked by a}} trumpet fanfare. This movement is in sonata rondo form with an opening theme requiring fast passage work from the soloist. The opening exposition leads into a brief second B major theme which is played by the soloist and builds to a series of rapidly ascending and descending arpeggios, reminiscent of the cadenza from the first movement. The orchestra then plays a variation of the opening melody, after which the music moves into a short development section in G major. The recapitulation is essentially similar to the exposition, apart from the addition of a counter-melody in the strings. The second theme is repeated, this time in the home key of E Major. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> a small cadenza {{near the end of the}} movement when the woodwinds play the main tune against prolonged trills from the solo violin. The concerto then concludes with a frenetic coda.|$|E

25|$|The {{entirety}} of Highway66 is located within Timiskaming District in the rugged and remote Canadian Shield.

25|$|The {{water supply}} in Miyakojima depends mainly on spring water or ground water, {{since there are}} almost no rivers. Although the yearly {{rainfall}} amounts to , 40% of it evaporates, 10% flows {{into the ground and}} 50% penetrates deep into the ground. Thus, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> no source of surface water.|$|E
25|$|Charon's {{diameter}} is , {{just over}} half that of Pluto, and larger than the dwarf planet Ceres, and the twelfth largest natural satellite in the solar system. Charon is sufficiently massive to have collapsed into a spheroid under its own gravity. Charon's slow rotation means that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> no flattening. Its equatorial and polar radii differ by less than 1%.|$|E
25|$|Unwashed silk chiffon may shrink up to 8% {{due to a}} {{relaxation}} of the fiber macrostructure, so silk should either be washed prior to garment construction, or dry cleaned. Dry cleaning may still shrink the chiffon up to 4%. Occasionally, this shrinkage can be reversed by a gentle steaming with a press cloth. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> no gradual shrinkage nor shrinkage due to molecular-level deformation.|$|E

25|$|The kolo is a {{collective}} folk dance common in various South Slavic regions, such as Serbia, {{named after the}} circle formed by the dancers. It is performed amongst groups of people (usually several dozen, {{at the very least}} three) holding each other's having their hands around each other's waists (ideally in a circle, hence the name). <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> no movement above the waist.|$|E
25|$|The risks {{incurred}} by the giving and receiving partner during the facial sexual act are drastically different. For the ejaculating partner <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> no risk of contracting an STI. For the receiving partner, {{the risk is}} higher. Since potentially infected semen could {{come into contact with}} broken skin or sensitive mucous membranes (eyes, lips, mouth), there is a risk of contracting an infectious disease.|$|E
25|$|There are 699,463 {{students}} enrolled in higher secondary education in public institutions. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> 50% boys and girls enrollment in higher secondary education.

There is also strict control over vehicle numbers around animal sightings, allowing for a better experience when out on a game drive.|$|E
25|$|A common {{example of}} a {{population}} bottleneck is the Northern elephant seal. Due to excessive hunting throughout the 19th century, {{the population of the}} northern elephant seal was reduced to 30 individuals or less. They have made a full recovery, with the total number of individuals at around 100,000 and growing. The effects of the bottleneck are visible, however. The seals {{are more likely to have}} serious problems with disease or genetic disorders, because <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> no diversity in the population.|$|E
25|$|The trifolium villa, {{named after}} a clover-shaped room that was without a doubt used as a triclinium, is the largest private house {{excavated}} so far at Dougga. The house had two storeys, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> nothing left of the upper storey. It stands {{in the south of}} the city, halfway up the hill. The house is particularly interesting because {{of the way in which}} it is built to align with the lay of the land; the entrance hall slopes down to a courtyard around which the various rooms were arranged.|$|E
