5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2001 college {{football}} season, the Gator Bowl Committee held contracts with the Atlantic Coast Conference, Big East Conference, and Notre Dame, allowing the committee to select either Notre Dame or a team from each of the conferences to fill the two available slots. According to contract, the committee had the first selection of teams from each of the two conferences after the conferences' champions were given automatic bids <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bowl</b> Championship Series game.|$|E
5|$|During {{the annual}} preseason poll of media members {{covering}} the Big East conference, Virginia Tech was picked to finish second among Big East teams, behind only Miami. The Hokies entered the 1994 college football season having finished the 1993 {{season with a}} win in the 1993 Independence Bowl, and hopes were high that they would return <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> game again in 1994.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} trip <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> {{sponsored}} by the newly formed Bowl Championship Series—which had replaced the Bowl Alliance—the No. 2 Hokies returned to New Orleans to face Bobby Bowden's No. 1 1999 Florida State Seminoles football team for the national championship. The Seminoles had narrowly lost the 1999 BCS National Championship Game to the Tennessee Volunteers and were looking to polish off an undefeated season by beating Virginia Tech.|$|E

5|$|Connecticut was {{selected}} as {{a participant in the}} 2009 International Bowl following a 7–5 regular season where they won their first five games, only to lose five of their last seven contests. Facing the Huskies were the Buffalo Bulls with a regular season record of 8–5, highlighted by an upset win over then-No.12 and undefeated Ball State in the 2008 MAC Championship Game. Pre-game media coverage focused on the legacy of the 1958 Buffalo Bulls, the first team from the university to be invited <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> game. When told that the two African-American members of the team {{would not be allowed to}} play because of segregation, the team elected to refuse the bowl bid. Buffalo would not play in a bowl until this game, 50years later.|$|E
5|$|Following the loss, Virginia Tech was 2–2 on the season, {{and faced}} the {{potential}} of being ineligible for a postseason bowl game {{if it did not}} improve its winning percentage. The Hokies won their next eight games, finishing the season with a 10–2 record. With late-season wins over perennial rival, 16th-ranked Virginia, and fellow ACC newcomer, ninth-ranked Miami, Virginia Tech clinched the ACC football championship (the last year in which it would be decided without a conference championship game) and a bid <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bowl</b> Championship Series game. Because the ACC's normal bowl destination, the Orange Bowl, was hosting the national championship game, Virginia Tech was selected to attend the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana, instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Virginia Tech {{received}} its first bid <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bowl</b> Coalition game. The Bowl Coalition, predecessor {{to the modern}} Bowl Championship Series, was intended to match up the two best teams in the Sugar, Orange, Fiesta, and Rose Bowls, with the two highest-ranked teams playing in a National Championship Game. Following the 1995-1996 college football season, Virginia Tech was selected {{to play in the}} 1995 Sugar Bowl {{as a result of this}} coalition. The No. 13 Hokies, who finished 9–2 during the regular season and were named Big East Conference champions, played against the No. 9 University of Texas, who finished 10–1–1 during the regular season en route to becoming Southwest Conference champions.|$|E

5|$|In {{recognition}} of his success in leading the Hokies <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> game win, Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick was named {{the most valuable player}} of the winning team. Vick finished the game having completed 10 of 18 passes for 205 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. Vick also ran the ball nine times for a gain of 21 yards and a touchdown. He was sacked twice, resulting in a loss of two yards. On {{the opposite side of the}} ball, Clemson wide receiver Rod Gardner was named the MVP of the losing team. He caught seven passes for 94 yards and a touchdown during the game.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{football}} team, {{since its}} creation in 1892, has played 30post-season bowl games in 16 different stadiums across nine states. This includes five Bowl Championship Series (BCS) game appearances and one {{appearance in the}} BCS National Championship Game. As of {{the completion of the}} 2016 regular season schedule, the Hokies have been invited <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> game every year since 1993. This 24-year active streak of consecutive bowl appearances is the longest such streak in the nation recognized by the NCAA. and is the fifth longest all-time bowl appearance streak.|$|E
5|$|Following the tie against Oklahoma, No. 16 Texas {{struggled}} against No. 14 Virginia in Austin. Not until the game's final play did the Longhorns secure their 1716 {{win over the}} favored Cavaliers. The game was the 700th victory in Texas football history and marked {{the only time in}} Texas' first 103 years of football that a game ended with Texas kicking a winning field goal. Following the victory over Virginia, Texas began a winning streak that continued through the remainder of the regular season. Heading into the final game of the regular season, it appeared that the winner of the Texas/Texas A game would clinch the Southwest Conference championship and a bid <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bowl</b> Alliance game. In Texas' final Southwestern Conference game, it secured the conference championship with a 166 win that guaranteed it a spot in a Bowl Alliance game. On the next day, the Sugar Bowl's pick of Texas was made official.|$|E

50|$|Shannon's {{first year}} as UM head coach in 2007 {{was one of the}} worst in the Hurricanes' modern history, with the team {{registering}} a losing 5-7 record. Under Shannon, the team failed <b>to</b> reach <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> game for the first time in a decade, and it was the first non-penalized full-scholarship team <b>to</b> miss <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> game in more than 25 years.|$|R

5|$|Pregame {{media and}} fan {{interest}} surrounding the game focused largely on Louisville's top-ranked offense and Virginia Tech's first-ranked scoring defense. Other major points of media coverage included the two teams' quarterbacks: Louisville's Hunter Cantwell, who replaced starter Brian Brohm after Brohm suffered a season-ending knee injury; and Virginia Tech's Marcus Vick, brother of National Football League star Michael Vick. Also {{a concern for}} Louisville was the health of star running back Michael Bush, who missed two games in November due to an injury. On a wider note, there was also interest in the conference-level showdown between a new Big East team (Louisville) and a team that left the Big East for the ACC after the 2003 season (Virginia Tech). For Virginia Tech, {{there was also the}} hope of overcoming the disappointment of a season that saw the Hokies ranked third in the country and in the hunt for the national championship before failing to even win the Atlantic Coast Conference and missing a bid <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bowl</b> Championship Series game.|$|E
5|$|The {{win over}} Duke was {{followed}} by several others in succession. Heading into their ninth game of the season, the Hokies were 8–0 record and the third-ranked college football team in the country. Against the fifth-ranked Miami Hurricanes, however, Virginia Tech suffered its first defeat of the season, falling 27–7. Tech recovered by winning its next two games, earning {{a spot in the}} inaugural Atlantic Coast Conference Championship Game, held in Jacksonville, Florida. There, the Hokies lost, 27–22, to the Florida State Seminoles. The Seminoles earned an automatic bid <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bowl</b> Championship Series game by virtue of the victory—had Virginia Tech won the game, it would have been awarded the bid. The day after Tech lost the ACC Championship Game, the Gator Bowl extended a formal invitation to Virginia Tech, which the Hokies accepted. Ninth-ranked Miami, the same team that beat the Hokies 27–7 earlier in the season, was considered for selection, but the Gator Bowl Association took into consideration Virginia Tech's history of having a large fan base travel to its bowl games, and selected the Hokies on those grounds.|$|E
5|$|Though Tech joined {{athletic}} {{conferences in}} other sports during the 1980s, it remained a football independent until 1991, when Virginia Tech {{became a member of}} the Big East conference. In 1993, Tech received an invitation to the Independence bowl, beginning a 16-year streak that has seen the Hokies invited <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> game at the conclusion of every season since then. In 1995, the Hokies defeated the Texas Longhorns in the 1995 Sugar Bowl, vaulting them into national prominence. In recent years, Virginia Tech football teams have been ranked among the best in the country according to season-ending polls. In 2000, Virginia Tech participated in the 2000 Sugar Bowl, which served as the national championship game of the 1999 college football season. In addition to that appearance, the Hokies have participated in several other Bowl Championship Series games, which represent the highest tier of postseason accomplishment.|$|E

5|$|While the 2009 International Bowl {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} of the Buffalo Bulls in a bowl game, {{it was not the}} first time the school had been invited <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl.</b> Fifty years earlier, the 1958 Buffalo Bulls team finished with a record of 8–1. They were awarded the Lambert Cup, given to the best small college team in the eastern US, and received a bid to play in the 1958 Tangerine Bowl, where they would face Florida State. There was one catch: the team's African-American players—starting running back Willie Evans and backup defensive end Mike Wilson—would not be allowed to play. The Tangerine Bowl Stadium was controlled by the Orlando High School Athletic Association, who prohibited integrated football games. University officials and the coaching staff decided to allow the team to vote on whether they would accept the bowl bid. Before secret ballots could be passed out, the players unanimously decided to reject the bid.|$|E
25|$|Although Brown {{consistently}} led the Longhorns <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> game to cap {{off each}} season {{in his first}} six years, {{he was not able}} to lead them <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bowl</b> Championship Series game, having to settle each year for the Holiday Bowl or Cotton Bowl Classic. His record in these games was 3–3, with two of the three losses coming at the hands of supposedly inferior teams as judged by the rankings headed into the games.|$|E
25|$|Two {{years later}} in 1962, Hess led Ohio to its first-ever bowl game, a matchup with West Texas State in the 1962 Sun Bowl. Jim McKee kicked a 52-yard field goal to put the Bobcats ahead early but they trailed at the half 7–3. In the third quarter, three time all-MAC {{performer}} Skip Hoovler intercepted a pass and ran it back 91 yards for a touchdown. Ohio led 14–7 {{late in the game}} before West Texas scored on a 32-yard touchdown pass and a two-point conversion to win 15–14. Hoovler was named Lineman of the Game, and his 91-yard interception still stands as a Sun Bowl record. Ironically, the Bobcats did not win the MAC in that 1962 season but did go <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl.</b> The following season, Ohio won the league championship but was not invited <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> game.|$|E

With four games remaining in the season, Navy needed to win at least two {{in order to be}} invited <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> game. The Poinsettia Bowl had arranged for the Midshipmen to play in that bowl if they reached six wins.|$|E
25|$|Willingham's {{third season}} {{started with a}} loss, but three {{straight}} wins brought the team back into national prominence.

Although the Irish were invited <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> game {{at the end of the}} season, Willingham was fired. The eventual hiring of Charlie Weis as Willingham's replacement was called a good move, but Willingham's firing remained a controversial subject for years following his tenure.|$|E
