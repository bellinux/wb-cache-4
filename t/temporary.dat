Additionally, the new Radar property has been added; when captured it clears a five-tile radius of Fog of War.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{resolution}} to the lifetime of <b>temporaries</b> in C++. The main rule is that <b>temporaries</b> are destroyed {{at the end of}} a full expression. The paper also contains a review of the alternatives discussed at meetings and the mail reflectors recently, and a few examples. 2. Proposal The proposal consists of two rules that cover all <b>temporaries,</b> and one rule about function parameters. R 1. <b>Temporaries</b> are destroyed at the end of the full expression in which they are created. R 2. <b>Temporaries,</b> like all C++ objects, are destroyed in reverse order of construction. R 3. The lifetime of a parameter is that of the body of its function, cf. Section 5. 2. 2 of the Working Paper. The term full expression is defined in Section 3. 6 of [ISO, 1990] and [ANSI, 1989] as follows: A full expression is an expression that is not part of another expression. Each of the following is a full expression: an initializer; the expression in an expression statement; the controlling expression of a s [...] ...|$|R

50|$|The library {{employs a}} delayed-evaluation {{approach}} (during compile time) to combine several operations into one and reduce (or eliminate) {{the need for}} <b>temporaries.</b> Where applicable, the order of operations is optimised.

40|$|Container {{classes in}} {{object-oriented}} languages often {{suffer from the}} problem of compiler-generated <b>temporaries.</b> Storage is allocated for each intermediate result in each expression, introducing huge penalties to performance. Loop fusion and array contraction, the most closely related compiler optimizations to this problem, are not powerful enough to optimize the container classes. The current workaround is to perform a manual optimization called Expression Templates (ETs), which utilizes C++ templates to perform arbitrary code generation, but is a very messy and inefficient way of doing things. We present a compiler alternative to ETs that uses programmer annotations to eliminate <b>temporaries</b> through expression fusion. Our solution is much better for programmer productivity than ETs, and also achieves results that are slightly better. iii Table of Content...|$|R

However this was scrapped because the club in charge of the venue missed the deadline to present its project.

It was later announced that the rugby competition will take place in a <b>temporary</b> arena at Deodoro Stadium, shared with the modern pentathlon.

Because of their close {{proximity}} to Chelsea Barracks {{it was expected that}} enemy bombers would target the three road bridges in the area, and a <b>temporary</b> bridge was built parallel to Chelsea Bridge. As with the four other <b>temporary</b> Thames bridges built in this period, it was built of steel girders supported by wooden stakes; however, despite its flimsy appearance it was a sturdy structure, capable of supporting tanks and other heavy military equipment. As it turned out, no enemy action took place in the area, and all three bridges survived the war undamaged. The <b>temporary</b> bridge was dismantled in 1945.|$|E
40|$|Scope. To {{demonstrate}} guided implant {{placement and}} the application of fixed, implant-supported prosthetic restorations with a fully digital workflow. Methods. Over a 2 -year period, all patients with partial edentulism of the posterior maxilla, in need of fixed implant-supported prostheses, were considered for inclusion in this study. The protocol required intraoral scanning and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), the superimposition of dental-gingival information on bone anatomy, surgical planning, 3 D-printed teeth-supported surgical templates, and modelling and milling of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) <b>temporaries</b> for immediate loading. After 3 months, final optical impression was taken and milled zirconia frameworks and 3 D-printed models were fabricated. The frameworks were veneered with ceramic and delivered to the patients. Results. Fifteen patients were selected for this study. The surgical templates were stable. Thirty implants were placed (BTK Safe®, BTK, Vicenza, Italy) and immediately loaded with PMMA <b>temporaries.</b> After 3 months, the <b>temporaries</b> were replaced by the final restorations in zirconia-ceramic, fabricated with a fully digital process. At 6 months, none of the patients reported any biological or functional problems with the implant-supported prostheses. Conclusions. The present procedure for fully digital planning of implants and short-span fixed implant-supported restorations {{has been shown to be}} reliable. Further studies are needed to validate these results...|$|R

50|$|Chairside CAD/CAM {{restoration}} {{differs from}} conventional dentistry {{in that the}} prosthesis is typically luted or bonded the same day. Conventional prosthesis, such as crowns, have <b>temporaries</b> placed from one to several weeks while a dental laboratory or in house dental lab produces the restoration. The patient returns later to have the <b>temporaries</b> removed and the laboratory-made crown cemented or bonded in place. An in-house CAD/CAM system enables the dentist to create a finished inlay {{in as little as}} an hour in some cases. Bonded veneer CAD/CAM restorations are more conservative in their preparation of the tooth. As bonding is more effective on tooth enamel than the underlying dentin, care is taken not to remove the enamel layer. Though one-day service is a benefit that is typically claimed by dentists offering chairside CAD/CAM services, the dentist's time is commonly doubled and the fee is therefore doubled.|$|R

40|$|On {{the basis}} of an A-normal form {{intermediate}} language we formally specify resource allocation in a compiler for a strict functional language. Here, resource is to be understood in the most general sense: registers, <b>temporaries,</b> data representations, etc. All these should be (and can be, but have never been) specified formally. Our approach employs a non-standard annotated type system for the formalization. Although A-normal form turns out not to be the ideal vehicle for this investigation, we can prove some basic properties using the formalization. 1 Resource Allocation Resource allocation in the back end of a compiler is often poorly specified. More often than not register allocation, administration of <b>temporaries,</b> and representation conversions are only specified procedurally [1, 6].
