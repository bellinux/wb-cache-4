40|$|Summary Summary Within the {{framework}} of the present dissertation important methodological and experimental aspects could be contributed to the development of charge density determination. For the first time it could be proven that with the combination of synchrotron primary radiation/CCD area detection electronic properties are accessible in a short time and that the accuracy of these properties is comparable or even superior to that obtained with point detection, requiring measurement times of several weeks. This has been doubted so far. This result opened the perspective on the one hand to do comparable studies on a class of related compounds, on the other hand it seemed possible to perform charge density studies on larger systems of biological importance. In this thesis both perspectives were followed. On six amino acids extensive charge density studies were performed including a complete topological analysis of the charge density of all the intra- and intermolecular interactions. For this class of compounds a high degree of reproducability and transferability of atomic and group properties could be found. The variance of these properties is even less than the one found when using ab initio calculations with different methods and basis sets. Therefore an experimental contribution to support the quantum theory of " Atoms in Molecules " was given. For the first time fine charge density reorganizations due to weak intermolecular interactions could be visualized {{with the help of the}} threedimensional experimental Laplacian function and therefore directions in which chemical interactions are favoured could be located and characterized. With the antithrombotic drug <b>Terbogrel</b> it was shown that a larger compound of biological relevance could be characterized electronically with high accuracy. In addition, taking the example of this drug, it could be shown that even a conventional X-ray source combined with area detection, which is getting nowadays common laboratory equipment, is suitable for charge density determination of larger molecules und thus opens the method for a larger community. Quantitative results on the electronic level could be obtained due to fast experiments, whose time consumption is far less than that of comparable ab initio calculations. An enhancement of resolution and accuracy could be reached. Besides the experimental contribution to the development in charge density determination introduced here this work also contributes to the fields of molecular modelling and drug design. </html...|$|E
