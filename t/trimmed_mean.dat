Judges award each component a raw mark from 0 to 10 in increments of 0.25, with a mark of 5 being defined as [...] "average". For each separate component, the raw marks are then selected, trimmed, and averaged in a manner akin to determining a grade of execution. The <b>trimmed</b> <b>mean</b> scores are then translated into a factored mark by multiplying by a factor {{that depends on the}} discipline, competition segment, and level. Then the five (or four) factored marks are added to give the final PCS score.|$|E
50|$|When the {{percentage}} of points to discard does not yield a whole number, the <b>trimmed</b> <b>mean</b> may be defined by interpolation, generally linear interpolation, between the nearest whole numbers. For example, {{if you need to}} calculate the 15% <b>trimmed</b> <b>mean</b> of a sample containing 10 entries, strictly this would mean discarding 1 point from each end (equivalent to the 10% <b>trimmed</b> <b>mean).</b> If interpolating, one would instead compute the 10% <b>trimmed</b> <b>mean</b> (discarding 1 point from each end) and the 20% <b>trimmed</b> <b>mean</b> (discarding 2 points from each end), and then interpolating, in this case averaging these two values. Similarly, if interpolating the 12% <b>trimmed</b> <b>mean,</b> one would take the weighted average: weight the 10% <b>trimmed</b> <b>mean</b> by 0.8 and the 20% <b>trimmed</b> <b>mean</b> by 0.2.|$|E
40|$|As estimators of {{location}} parameters, univariate <b>trimmed</b> <b>means</b> {{are well known}} for their robustness and efficiency. They can serve as robust alternatives to the sample mean while possessing high efficiencies at normal as well as heavy-tailed models. This paper introduces multidimensional <b>trimmed</b> <b>means</b> based on projection depth induced regions. Robustness of these depth <b>trimmed</b> <b>means</b> is investigated {{in terms of the}} influence function and finite sample breakdown point. The influence function captures the local robustness whereas the breakdown point measures the global robustness of estimators. It is found that the projection depth <b>trimmed</b> <b>means</b> are highly robust locally as well as globally. Asymptotics of the depth <b>trimmed</b> <b>means</b> are investigated via those of the directional radius of the depth induced regions. The strong consistency, asymptotic representation and limiting distribution of the depth <b>trimmed</b> <b>means</b> are obtained. Relative to the mean and other leading competitors, the depth <b>trimmed</b> <b>means</b> are highly efficient at normal or symmetric models and overwhelmingly more efficient when these models are contaminated. Simulation studies confirm the validity of the asymptotic efficiency results at finite samples.

40|$|The {{question}} of how much to trim or which weighting constant to use are practical considerations in applying robust methods such as <b>trimmed</b> <b>means</b> (L-estimators) and Huber statistics (M-estimators). An index of location relative efficiency (LRE), which is a ratio of the narrowness of resulting confidence intervals, was applied to various <b>trimmed</b> <b>means</b> and Huber M-estimators calculated on seven representative data sets from applied education and psychology research. On the basis of LREs, lightly <b>trimmed</b> <b>means</b> were found to be more efficient than heavily <b>trimmed</b> <b>means,</b> but Huber M-estimators systematically produced narrower confidence intervals.

To remedy this problem several methods have been proposed.

40|$|This paper reinvestigates the {{performance}} of trimmed-mean inflation measures some 20 years since their inception, asking {{whether there is a}} particular trimmed-mean measure that dominates the median consumer price index (CPI). Unlike previous research, we evaluate {{the performance}} of symmetric and asymmetric <b>trimmed</b> <b>means</b> using a well known equality of prediction test. We find that there is a large swath of <b>trimmed</b> <b>means</b> that have statistically indistinguishable performance. Also, although the swath of statistically similar trims changes slightly over different sample periods, it always includes the median CPI - an extreme trim that holds conceptual and computational advantages. We conclude with a simple forecasting exercise that highlights the advantage of the median CPI (and trimmed-mean estimators in general) relative to other standard measures in forecasting headline inflation...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} {{we look at the}} {{statistical}} properties of components forming the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), the headline inflation index for the Indian economy. We find that not only is the distribution of price changes at the disaggregate level highly leptokurtic, but also the cross-sectional distribution of price changes is positively skewed. This has the implication that the weighted mean would fail to be an efficient estimator of inflation. Trimmed Means, belonging to the class of limited influence estimators, have been used by many central banks to get around the skewness problem. We also explore the use of <b>trimmed</b> <b>means</b> for efficiently estimating inflation for India. In particular, we study the robustness of <b>trimmed</b> <b>means</b> to the benchmark (Centered Moving Average vs. trends derived from the Hodrick Prescott Filter) and the evaluation criteria (Mean Absolute Deviation vs. Root Mean Square Error vs. an Asymmetric Loss Function). Although we study the performance of <b>trimmed</b> <b>means</b> against the weighted mean in some detail, we stop short of proposing any ‘one’ trimming pattern as the ideal. The selection of the headline inflation rate depends as much on its ability to track the underlying trend void of transitory disturbances as much on its ability to forecast future inflation and its correlation with money growth, something we don’t deal with in the present study. ...|$|R

The remaining test, due to Wilcox and Keselman (2003), used a modification of the well-known one-step M-estimator of central tendency rather than <b>trimmed</b> <b>means.</b> The Welch-James-type test is recommended because for nonnormal data likely to be encountered in applied research settings it should be {{more powerful than the}} test presented by Wilcox and Keselman.
