25|$|Gentzen {{asserted}} a sharp {{distinction between}} his single-output natural deduction systems (NK and NJ) and his multiple-output sequent calculus systems (LK and LJ). He {{wrote that the}} intuitionistic natural deduction system NJ was somewhat ugly. He said that the special role of the excluded middle in the classical natural deduction system NK is removed in the classical sequent calculus system LK. He said that the sequent calculus LJ gave more symmetry than natural deduction NJ {{in the case of}} intuitionistic logic, as also in the case of classical logic (LK versus NK). <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that in addition to these reasons, the sequent calculus with multiple succedent formulas is intended particularly for his principal theorem ("Hauptsatz").|$|E
25|$|It {{caused him}} to reflect. But there was no result. The {{justice of the peace}} was a stern man. On the trial he found fault with the scheme and {{required}} us to explain upon what we based our strange conduct—as he called it. The understudy said:“On the custom of the niggers. They all do it.” The justice forgot his dignity and descended to sarcasm. “Custom of the niggers! Are our morals so inadequate that we have to borrow of niggers?” <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to the jury: “Three melons were owing; they were collected from persons not proven to owe them: this is theft; they were collected by compulsion: this is extortion. A melon was added for the widows and orphans. It was owed by no one. It is another theft, another extortion. Return it whence it came, with the others. It is not permissible here to apply to any purpose goods dishonestly obtained; not even to the feeding of widows and orphans, for this would be to put a shame upon charity and dishonor it.” He said it in open court, before everybody, and to me it did not seem very kind.|$|E
500|$|Although Kidd {{drove his}} dancers hard, {{partly because he}} himself was capable of doing all the dance steps that he {{required}} of them, his personal style was gentle. Nanette Fabray, who performed in Love Life, could only make dancing turns {{to the left side}} because of a hearing problem. Rather than insisting she turn to the right, as many choreographers would do, Kidd [...] "found that fascinating, and he made all the other dancers turn to the left". Julie Andrews recalled that the [...] "Burlington Bertie From Bow" [...] number in Star! was physically demanding, and she balked when Kidd asked her for a retake, saying she had a bad back. Andrews recalled that [...] "he looked crestfallen. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'I wasn't trying to be mean. I just knew that when you saw it on film, you wouldn't be pleased.' I always thought that was a nice way to say, 'Once more.|$|E

500|$|The Rhodesian press {{reported}} {{extensively on}} the Lisbon controversy {{during the second half}} of August, generally predicting that neither Britain, Portugal nor Rhodesia would back down. While most reporters believed that Whitehall would take a strong line, few could see any way it could actually stop Reedman from taking office. On 20 August, Bottomley spoke at his final conference in Lagos, and repeated all he had previously said regarding Britain's stance on Rhodesia. Back in London three days later, he reaffirmed his previous stance regarding Lisbon, saying that he would be pleased to have a Rhodesian on the staff of the British Embassy there, but would allow no more. In the same interview, he expressed the belief that Wilson had averted a Rhodesian UDI in October the previous year by warning Salisbury of the economic consequences. Speaking in Gwelo on 27 August, Smith derided this statement, calling it [...] "incredible". His administration had not even considered a declaration of independence <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> but it was contemplated now, and he believed Anglo-Rhodesian relations were at their all-time lowest ebb. He urged Britain to return to the bargaining table quickly.|$|E
500|$|According to Stevens, {{in one of}} {{his first}} games as head coach, he was nervous and [...] "felt like our team played on edge" [...] because of it. He decided that a team's play will reflect the mood of its coach; a calm coach means a team that will remain poised in {{difficult}} game situations, while a nervous coach means a team that plays on edge. [...] "I don’t want to lose a game because of my approach," [...] he told himself. Accordingly, he developed a strategy of always remaining calm and focused during games. He rarely raises his voice or gets emotional, instead quietly observing on the sideline with folded arms. He does not get upset about bad calls by referees or player mistakes, preferring to focus on [...] "the next play" [...] rather than what just happened. Butler player Willie Veasley explained Butler's 2010 Final Four run by saying, [...] "When those big runs [...] came, Coach called a timeout and said a few calm words. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> he believes in us, he loves us and we're going to win the game." [...] On the rare occasion Stevens feels the need to correct a player, he does it with [...] "positive reinforcement, just at a little louder decibel", according to former assistant coach Matthew Graves. Above all, Stevens wants his players to be confident, not living in fear of being yanked for making a bad play.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a letter}} home, Young states, [...] "He died {{suddenly}} noon Monday. I saw him Sunday afternoon – he smiled – and amongst other things, said, “Are {{you sure you}} are quite well?" [...] "Quite." [...] I said, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I don’t understand." ...|$|E

50|$|Consider {{the payoff}} matrix pictured {{to the right}} (known as a {{coordination}} game). Here one player chooses the row and the other chooses a column. The row player receives the first payoff, the column player the second. If row opts to play A with probability 1 (i.e. play A for sure), <b>then</b> <b>he</b> is <b>said</b> to be playing a pure strategy. If column opts to flip a coin and play A if the coin lands heads and B if the coin lands tails, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> is <b>said</b> to be playing a mixed strategy, and not a pure strategy.|$|R
2500|$|The Quran {{directly}} compares Jesus to Adam {{in terms}} of how he came into existence. Sura Al-Imran says, [...] "Verily, the likeness of Jesus before Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, <b>then</b> <b>He</b> <b>said</b> to him: 'Be!' – and he was." ...|$|E
2500|$|My friend said, [...] "Listen to {{this guy}} play", and I went, [...] "No way! Listening to someone play the guitar is the very last thing I want to do right now!" [...] But he kept insisting {{and he ended up}} playing the record for me. I told him I thought it was really good and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "You know, the guy's only playing with two fingers on his {{fretboard}} hand because of an injury he sustained in a terrible fire." [...] I was totally knocked back by this revelation and was so impressed by what I had just heard that I suddenly became inspired to start trying to play again.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>then</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> used {{often to}} see people's Doppelganger; at another time, as to ghosts, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>He</b> was like Coleridge: {{he had seen}} too many of 'em.

2500|$|Dot Scott, {{president}} of the local branch of the NAACP, said she had heard from victims' relatives that the shooter spared one woman (Sanders' mother) so she could, according to him, tell other people what happened.

[...] According to the son {{of one of the}} victims, who spoke to that survivor, the shooter allegedly turned the gun to his own head and pulled the trigger, but only then discovered he was out of ammunition. Before leaving the church, he reportedly [...] "uttered a racially inflammatory statement" [...] over the victims' bodies. The entire shooting lasted for approximately six minutes.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1973, when Brezhnev {{arrived in}} the United States to have a one-week meeting with [...] Nixon, Brezhnev told the press, [...] "I {{do not intend to}} refer to that matter—. It would be {{completely}} indecent for me to refer to it. ... My attitude toward Mr. Nixon is of very great respect." [...] When one reporter suggested that Nixon and his position with Brezhnev were [...] "weakened" [...] by the scandal, Brezhnev replied, [...] "It does not enter my mind to think whether Mr. Nixon has lost or gained any influence because of the affair." [...] <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> further that he had respected Nixon because of Nixon's [...] "realistic and constructive approach to Soviet Union–United States relations ... passing from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiations between nations".|$|E

2500|$|Armstrong {{has been}} criticized for his {{disagreements}} with outspoken opponents of doping such as Paul Kimmage and Christophe Bassons. Bassons was a rider for Festina {{at the time of the}} Festina affair and was widely reported by teammates as being the only rider on the team not to be taking performance-enhancing drugs. Bassons wrote a number of articles for a French newspaper during the 1999 Tour de France which made references to doping in the peloton. Subsequently, Armstrong had an altercation with Bassons during the 1999 Tour de France where Bassons said Armstrong rode up alongside on the Alpe d'Huez stage to tell him [...] "it was a mistake to speak out the way I (Bassons) do and he (Armstrong) asked why I was doing it. I told him that I'm thinking of the next generation of riders. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> 'Why don't you leave, then?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Linehan {{discussed}} the dramatic effect this choice {{had on the}} tone of the series: [...] "'Woman of the World' was kind of like a jaunty, plinky-plonky song, and we wanted that song.

We were saying, you know, we don't like sitcoms. This is a parody of sitcoms. This is a kind of satire on sitcoms. And I remember Geoffrey [...] looking really glum and sad about this, you know?

I had the idea of just this guy, a fat little monster sits there very relaxed and says, [...] "Oh yeah, oh yeah". So I told him, 'Why don't you try just to sing on and on 'oh yeah'?... Dieter was very angry when I told him this and he said, 'are you crazy, all the time [...] "Oh yeah"? Are you crazy?! I can't do this, no no, come on, come on.' And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'some lyrics, like [...] "the moon... beautiful", is this too much?!' and I said, 'no, it's OK', and then he did this 'oh yeah' and at the end he thought, 'yeah it's nice', he loved it himself also.

2500|$|Former French {{president}} Valéry Giscard d'Estaing {{claimed that}} Bongo helped bankroll Jacques Chirac's 1981 presidential campaign.

From that moment on, I broke off personal relations with him", said Giscard. Socialist French parliamentarian André Vallini reportedly claimed that Bongo had bankrolled numerous French electoral campaigns, both Right and Left. In 2008, French President, Nicolas Sarkozy demoted his minister in charge of looking after the ex-colonies, Jean-Marie Bockel, after the latter noted the [...] "squandering of public funds" [...] by some African regimes, provoking Mr. Bongo's fury.He made his country and his oil industry available as a source of offshore slush funds", said political analyst Nicholas Shaxson, {{the author of a book}} on Africa's oil states.

2500|$|On 8 October 1803, the French {{abandoned}} Port-au-Prince as Rochambeau {{decided to}} concentrate {{what was left}} of his army at Le Cap. Dessalines marched into Port-au-Prince, where was welcomed as a hero by the 100 whites who had chosen to stay behind. Dessalines thanked them all for their kindness and belief in racial equality, but <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that the French had treated him as less than human when he was a slave, and so to avenge his mistreatment, he promptly had the 100 whites all hanged. On 3 November, the frigate HMS Blanche captured a supply schooner near Cap Français, the last hope in supplying the French forces. On 16 November 1803, Dessalines began attacking the French blockhouses outside of Le Cap The last battle on land of the Haitian Revolution, the Battle of Vertières, occurred on 18 November 1803, near Cap-Haïtien fought between Dessalines' army and the remaining French colonial army under the Vicomte de Rochambeau; the slave rebels and freed revolutionary soldiers won the battle. By this point, Perry observed that both sides were [...] "a little mad" [...] as the pressures of the war and yellow fever had taken their toil, and both the French and the Haitians fought with a reckless courage, seeing death in battle as preferable to a slow death by yellow fever or being tortured to death by the enemy.|$|E
