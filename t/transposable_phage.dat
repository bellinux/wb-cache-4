40|$|Bacteriophage B 3 is a <b>transposable</b> <b>phage</b> of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this report, {{we present}} the {{complete}} DNA sequence and annotation of the B 3 genome. DNA sequence {{analysis revealed that}} the B 3 genome is 38, 439 bp long with a G+C content of 63. 3 %. The genome contains 59 proposed open reading frames (ORFs) organized into at least three operons. Of these ORFs, the predicted proteins from 41 ORFs (68 %) display significant similarity to other phage or bacterial proteins. Many of the predicted B 3 proteins are homologous to those encoded by the early genes and head genes of Mu and Mu-like prophages found in sequenced bacterial genomes. Only two of the predicted B 3 tail proteins are homologous to other well-characterized phage tail proteins; however, several Mu-like prophages and <b>transposable</b> <b>phage</b> D 3112 encode approximately 10 highly similar proteins in their predicted tail gene regions. Comparison of the B 3 genomic organization with that of Mu revealed evidence of multiple genetic rearrangements, the most notable being the inversion of the proposed B 3 immunity/early gene region, the loss of Mu-like tail genes, and an extreme leftward shift of the B 3 DNA modification gene cluster. These differences illustrate and support the widely held view that tailed phages are genetic mosaics arising by the exchange of functional modules within a diverse genetic pool...|$|E

40|$|Bacteriophage D 3112 {{represents}} one of two distinct groups of <b>transposable</b> <b>phage</b> found in the clinically relevant, opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To further our understanding of <b>transposable</b> <b>phage</b> in P. aeruginosa, we have sequenced the complete genome of D 3112. The genome is 37, 611 bp, with an overall G+C content of 65 %. We have identified 53 potential open reading frames, including three genes (the c repressor gene and early genes A and B) that have been previously characterized and sequenced. The organization of the putative coding regions corresponds to published genetic and transcriptional maps and {{is very similar to}} that of enterobacteriophage Mu. In contrast, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has classified D 3112 as a λ-like phage {{on the basis of its}} morphology. Similarity-based analyses identified 27 open reading frames with significant matches to proteins in the NCBI databases. Forty-eight percent of these were similar to Mu-like phage and prophage sequences, including proteins responsible for transposition, transcriptional regulation, virion morphogenesis, and capsid formation. The tail proteins were highly similar to prophage sequences in Escherichia coli and phage Phi 12 from Staphylococcus aureus, while proteins at the right end were highly similar to proteins in Xylella fastidiosa. We performed phylogenetic analyses to understand the evolutionary relationships of D 3112 with respect to Mu-like versus λ-like bacteriophages. Different results were obtained from similarity-based versus phylogenetic analyses in some instances. Overall, our findings reveal a highly mosaic structure and suggest that extensive horizontal exchange of genetic material played an important role in the evolution of D 3112...|$|E

40|$|Sequences of {{the most}} conserved {{proteins}} encoded by <b>transposable</b> (pro) <b>phages</b> were used to search recently sequenced Firmicute genomes for candidate transposable prophages. One complete Mu-like prophage, SglyMu- 1, was identified, in four copies, in the Syntrophobotulus glycolicus DSM 8271 chromosome sequence. Related prophages were also found in partially assembled genomic sequences of other Firmicutes and newly sequenced Proteobacteria genomes, opening {{the road to the}} use of Mu-like derived genetic tools in Gram+ bacteria. SglyMu- 1 appears to carry a host variation system related to the DGR tropism switching retroelements, first characterized in Bordetella phages BPP- 1, BIP- 1 and BMP- 1. <b>Transposable</b> <b>phages</b> are thus thriving among Firmicutes and can harness either of two host variation systems, the fiber genes inversion and reverse transcriptase-mediated site-directed, adenine-specific mutagenesis. © 2013 Institut Pasteur.

40|$|Long {{terminal}} repeat (LTR) retrotransposons and DNA transposons are transposable elements (TEs) that perform cleavage {{and transfer}} at precise DNA positions. Here, we present statistical analyses of sequences {{found at the}} termini of precise TEs in the human genome.

Interestingly, these sequences are the most flexible base pair steps in DNA. Both the sequence preference and the degree of conservation of each position within the human LTR dinucleotide termini are remarkably similar to those experimentally demonstrated in <b>transposable</b> <b>phage</b> Mu.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} and characterize genes whose transcription is affected by arsenic and antimony, random lacZ fusions in the E. coli chromosome were constructed using the Mud I <b>transposable</b> <b>phage.</b> One clone was isolated that contained a lacZ transcriptional fusion induced by arsenic, antimony, and their associated salts. When cells were subjected to DNA-damaging agents such as mitomycin C and sodium dichromate, {{a low level of}} induction resulted. In addition, a marked increase in arsenic sensitivity was observed in the fusion clone as compared to the parent strain presumably due to the insertional inactivation of the E. coli gene(s) by the Mu prophage. By Southern Blotting analysis of the original gene fusion, as well as genetically identical transductant, only one copy of the lacZ fusion was observed. From these results, a preliminary map of the site of insertion of the reporter gene within the arsenic/antimony responding gene has been generated. This strain should prove to be useful in the rapid detection of low bioavailable concentrations of arsenic, as well as to study the molecular mechanisms of arsenic toxicity...|$|E
40|$|The {{products}} of the A genes of bacteriophages Mu of Escherichia coli and D 3112 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are required for the transposition of the double-stranded DNA genomes of their respective phages. Mutant proteins of the multifunctional Mu transposase were constructed in vitro in order to locate regions of the enzyme that may be important for function. Deletions in the Mu A gene yielded two mutant proteins that help to define the end-specific DNA-binding domain. The insertion of two or four amino acids at eight different sites produced six mutant transposase proteins that were inhibited for $ mu$Mu transposition in vivo, but not DNA binding in vitro, at 37 $ sp circ$C.

40|$|Bacteriophage genomes can be {{regarded}} as an ensemble of modules which are accessible to the whole phage population via recombination. The time spent by prophages in the bacterial host provides them with the opportunity to exchange modules with other prophages or infecting phages. Here we analyze the modular structure of a set of 457 phages and 760 prophages extracted from completely sequenced bacterial genomes using the ACLAME database and its associated tools. We identified 91 modules of proteins with similar phylogenetic profiles. Of these, 25 and 6 are associated with temperate and virulent phages, respectively; 57 are restricted to a host or small group of hosts; and 55 could be annotated with a phage function. We use the <b>transposable</b> <b>phages</b> as a study case and show how the inclusion of prophages allows us to unveil new types of genome organization (i. e. novel module combinations) and obtain insight into the host range for this particular group, highlighting the utility of prophage prediction to better characterize phage diversity. © 2011 Institut Pasteur.

40|$|The c gene {{products}} from related, <b>transposable</b> <b>phages</b> Mu and D 108 encode lysogenic repressors which negatively regulate transcription and transposition. Using the {{gel shift assay}} to monitor c-operator specific DNA-binding activity, the 19. 5 kDa D 108 c repressor was purified to homogeneity. Sequence analysis of the N-terminus confirmed {{the identity of the}} purified protein as the repressor and ascribed its ATG initiation codon to base pair 864 from the D 108 left end. Analytical gel filtration and dimethyl suberimidate cross-linking of repressor at 0. 1 - 0. 5 microM concentrations revealed that the repressor protein could form oligomers in the absence of its DNA substrate. From DNase I footprinting and gel mobility shift analyses, the D 108 repressor only bound to two operators (O 1 and O 2) which, as in Mu, flank an Integration Host Factor (IHF) binding site. In contrast to Mu, an O 3 site in D 108 was not found. Moreover, D 108 repressor first bound operator O 2, while occupancy of O 1 required higher protein concentrations. The implications of these results on the D 108 regulatory system are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Mucts 4 was {{isolated}} more than 30 {{years ago and}} was the first available thermoinducible derivative of <b>transposable</b> <b>phage</b> Mu. We have characterized the cts 4 mutation and the corresponding mutant protein. Contrary to previously characterized thermoinducible Mu prophages (e. g. Mucts 62), Mucts 4 lysogenizes at reduced frequency even at 30 °C. The cts 4 mutation (Leu 129 Val) was located in this central repressor region. The cts 4 protein was thermosensitive for operator DNA binding in vitro. Temperature-dependent changes in protein-protein cross-linking patterns in the absence of DNA were detected for purified wild type, cts 62 and cts 4 repressor proteins. The cts 4 protein exhibited a subtly different electrophoretic profile, which became more marked at higher temperatures, from both the wild type and cts 62. In addition the cts 4 repressor generated a significantly different pattern of binding to DNA fragments carrying the early operator region. Consistent with the predicted involvement of the central leucine-rich region of the Mu repressor in the formation of multimeric forms, the cts 4 mutation thus appeared to affect protein-protein interactions. © 2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

40|$|Temperate phages drive genomic {{diversification}} in bacterial pathogens. Phage-derived sequences {{are more}} common in pathogenic than nonpathogenic taxa and are associated with changes in pathogen virulence. High abundance and mobilization of temperate phages within hosts suggests that temperate phages could promote within-host evolution of bacterial pathogens. However, their role in pathogen evolution has not been experimentally tested. We experimentally evolved replicate populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{with or without a}} community of three temperate phages active in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung infections, including the <b>transposable</b> <b>phage,</b> ɸ 4, which is closely related to phage D 3112. Populations grew as free-floating biofilms in artificial sputum medium, mimicking sputum of CF lungs where P. aeruginosa is an important pathogen and undergoes evolutionary adaptation and diversification during chronic infection. Although bacterial populations adapted to the biofilm environment in both treatments, population genomic analysis revealed that phages altered both the trajectory and mode of evolution. Populations evolving with phages exhibited a greater degree of parallel evolution and faster selective sweeps than populations without phages. Phage ɸ 4 integrated randomly into the bacterial chromosome, but integrations into motility-associated genes and regulators of quorum sensing systems essential for virulence were selected in parallel, strongly suggesting that these insertional inactivation mutations were adaptive. Temperate phages, and in particular transposable phages, are therefore likely to facilitate adaptive evolution of bacterial pathogens within hosts...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBacteriophage D 3112 is a Mu-like {{temperate}} <b>transposable</b> <b>phage</b> of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Genetic mapping and DNA {{sequence analysis}} {{have identified the}} left end of the phage genome as encoding the transposase enzyme (A) and the lysogenic (c) repressor. The c open reading frame (ORF), located at the leftmost end of the phage genome and transcribed from right to left, has four possible GTG initiation codons. Using site-directed mutagenesis, {{each of the four}} GTG codons was modified to GTA, which cannot serve as an initiation codon. Plasmids were constructed expressing either the wild-type repressor ORF or the ORFs containing the mutated GTA codons. When introduced into Pseudomonas aeruginosa, no immunity to superinfection by D 3112 was observed when the second GTG had been mutated. Northern blotting analysis demonstrated that the D 3112 c repressor is transcribed as a 900 -nt mRNA. The promoter region was defined by transcriptional lacZ fusions and primer extension analyses to bp 972 – 940 from the left end of the phage genome. When the D 3112 c repressor was overexpressed and purified as a fusion protein with a C-terminal six-histidine extension (cts 15 -His 6), it showed high affinity for a 261 -bp PvuII fragment localized directly upstream of the c repressor ORF. Our results indicate that although D 3112 c shows higher amino acid similarity to the λ family of repressors than it does to those of Mu and D 108, it appears that its structure and function more accurately reflect an evolutionary ancestry with those from transposable coliphages Mu and D 108...|$|E
40|$|S. flexneri is {{the leading}} cause of bacillary {{dysentery}} in the developing countries. Several temperate phages originating from this host have been characterised. However, all S. flexneri phages known to date are lambdoid phages, which have the ability to confer the O-antigen modification of their host. In this study, we report the isolation and characterisation of a novel Mu-like phage from a serotype 4 a strain of S. flexneri. The genome of phage SfMu is composed of 37, 146 bp and is predicted to contain 55 open reading frames (orfs). Comparative genome analysis of phage SfMu with Mu and other Mu-like phages revealed that SfMu is closely related to phage Mu, sharing > 90 % identity with majority of its proteins. Moreover, investigation of phage SfMu receptor on the surface of the host cell revealed that the O-antigen of the host serves as the receptor for the adsorption of phage SfMu. This study also demonstrates pervasiveness of SfMu phage in S. flexneri, by identifying complete SfMu prophage strains of serotype X and Y, and remnants of SfMu in strains belonging to 4 other serotypes, thereby indicating that <b>transposable</b> <b>phages</b> in S. flexneri are not uncommon.

40|$|Morphogenesis of the dsDNA phages is {{a highly}} {{regulated}} process that utilizes multicomponent pathways to assemble precursors of heads and tails. These mechanisms have been extensively investigated in many phage systems but {{have yet to be}} well characterized for the <b>transposable</b> <b>phages.</b> To investigate morphogenesis in these systems, we have cloned and sequenced 4. 5 kb the of the DNA of phage Mu immediately downstream of the first late promoter P lys; expressed the associated proteins; examined phage development in thin section; and refined our existing in vitro packaging assay. Previous amber mutant analysis had located the lytic and maturation genes of Mu in the Plys transcript. Sequence data were derived from this region and were analyzed with various computer algorithms, to characterize all potential open reading frames (ORFs), and to assign function to some ORFs based on homology to previously characterized genes. Sequencing of lys, D and E amber mutants was used to assign these genes to specific ORFs. Cloning and expression of the region proximal to the Plys promoter resulted in the production of protein extracts that specifically recognize the phage-encoded packaging signal, characteristic of phage maturation enzymes. Additionally, the growth characteristics of strains expressing these late gene constructs show that lysis of the cultures is induced {{as a result of the}} presence of one or more phage-specific proteins expressed from this region. Our studies indicate a deviation from existing phage lysis paradigms. Thin section electron micrographs show that the development of the structures from induced prophages occurs relatively late in the lytic cycle. Sucrose gradient fractions highly enriched for proheads are associated with pac-specific DNA recognition functions. A specific DNA substrate can be packaged, in vitro, into these active proheads.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that the class III bacteriophages Mu and D 108 and the class II elements, Tn 3, Tn 1000, IS 101 and Tn 951, share the characteristics of replicatively transposing to random positions, producing 5 bp target site duplications and of containing the sequence 5 $ sp prime$-PUCGAAAPu- 3 $ sp prime$ at bp 21 from their ends. These shared characteristics led to the hypothesis that these class III and class II elements evolved from a common ancestor transposon. Functional evidence which supports this hypothesis was obtained using the band retardation and in vivo transposition-mating assays. Mu and D 108 transposase proteins were shown to mediate the formation of specific protein-DNA complexes with the ends of Tn 3 and IS 101, {{but not with the}} ends of the IS 102 element (class I) demonstrating the conservation of {{the first step in the}} transposition reaction between Mu, D 108, Tn 3 and IS 101. Transposition-mating assays with Mu transposase and the Tn 3 kan element demonstrated that recombination (rec A independent) products between Tn 3 kan-containing plasmids and the target (pOX 38 cam) were formed in the absence of Mu transposase, but their formation was stimulated 200 -fold in the presence of Mu transposase protein. These transposition-mating products were resolved in rec $A sp+$ hosts, to generate resolution products suggestive of replicative transposition. Upon subsequent analysis, it was shown that the resolved products (pOX 38 cam::Tn 3 kan) had not been cleaved precisely at the Tn 3 kan element ends, but in the adjacent donor plasmid (pDV-cam) sequences. Similar experiments with the IS 101 element demonstrated that plasmids containing IS 101 plus adjacent pSC 101 sequences (bp 2233 to 2424), including a formerly unknown, but functional (bound by IHF) IHF site (bp 2238 - 2251), produced resolvable transposition-mating products in the presence of Mu transposase. These resolution products suggested that IS 101 (like Tn 3 kan) was replicatively transposed. The results presented provide functional evidence that links (evolutionarily) the class III <b>transposable</b> <b>phages</b> Mu and D 108 and the class II elements Tn 3 and IS 101...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) is a {{versatile}} group of Gram negative organisms {{that can be}} found throughout the environment in sources such as soil, water, and plants. While BCC bacteria can be involved in beneficial interactions with plants, they are also considered opportunistic pathogens, specifically in patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic granulomatous disease. These organisms also exhibit resistance to many antibiotics, making conventional treatment often unsuccessful. KS 10 was isolated as a prophage of B. cenocepacia K 56 - 2, a clinically relevant strain of the BCC. Our objective was to sequence the genome of this phage and also determine if this prophage encoded any virulence determinants. Results KS 10 is a 37, 635 base pairs (bp) <b>transposable</b> <b>phage</b> of the opportunistic pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia. Genome sequence analysis and annotation of this phage reveals that KS 10 shows the closest sequence homology to Mu and BcepMu. KS 10 was found to be a prophage in three different strains of B. cenocepacia, including strains K 56 - 2, J 2315, and C 5424, and seven tested clinical isolates of B. cenocepacia, but no other BCC species. A survey of 23 strains and 20 clinical isolates of the BCC revealed that KS 10 is able to form plaques on lawns of B. ambifaria LMG 19467, B. cenocepacia PC 184, and B. stabilis LMG 18870. Conclusion KS 10 is a novel phage with a genomic organization that differs from most phages in that its capsid genes are not aligned into one module but rather separated by approximately 11 kb, giving evidence of one or more prior genetic rearrangements. There were no potential virulence factors identified in KS 10, though many hypothetical proteins were identified with no known function. </p...|$|E

40|$|The <b>transposable</b> and {{temperate}} <b>phage</b> Mu infects Escherichia coli {{where it}} can enter the lytic life-cycle or reside as a repressed and integrated prophage. The repressor protein Rep is the key element in the lysis-lysogeny decision. We have analyzed the fate of Rep in different mutants by Western blotting under two conditions that can induce a lysogen: high temperature and stationary phase. We show that, unexpectedly, Rep accumulates under all conditions where the prophage is completely derepressed, and that this accumulation is ClpX-dependent. An analysis of the degradation kinetics shows that Rep is a target of two protease systems: inactivation of either the clpP or lon gene results in a stabilization of Rep. Such a reaction scheme explains the counterintuitive observation that derepression is correlated with high repressor concentration. We conclude that under all conditions of phage induction the repressor is sequestered in a non-active form. A quantitative simulation accounts for our experimental data. It provides a model that captures the essential features of Mu induction and explains some of the mechanisms by which the physiological signals affecting the lysis-lysogeny decision converge onto Rep. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|International audienceGene {{duplication}} {{followed by}} neo- or sub-functionalization deeply impacts {{the evolution of}} protein families and {{is regarded as the}} main source of adaptive functional novelty in eukaryotes. While there is ample evidence of adaptive gene duplication in prokaryotes, {{it is not clear whether}} duplication outweighs the contribution of horizontal gene transfer in the expansion of protein families. We analyzed closely related prokaryote strains or species with small genomes (Helicobacter, Neisseria, Streptococcus, Sulfolobus), average-sized genomes (Bacillus, Enterobacteriaceae), and large genomes (Pseudomonas, Bradyrhizobiaceae) to untangle the effects of duplication and horizontal transfer. After removing the effects of <b>transposable</b> elements and <b>phages,</b> we show that the vast majority of expansions of protein families are due to transfer, even among large genomes. Transferred genes [...] xenologs [...] persist longer in prokaryotic lineages possibly due to a higher/longer adaptive role. On the other hand, duplicated genes [...] paralogs [...] are expressed more, and, when persistent, they evolve slower. This suggests that gene transfer and gene duplication have very different roles in shaping the evolution of biological systems: transfer allows the acquisition of new functions and duplication leads to higher gene dosage. Accordingly, we show that paralogs share most protein-protein interactions and genetic regulators, whereas xenologs share very few of them. Prokaryotes invented most of life's biochemical diversity. Therefore, the study of the evolution of biology systems should explicitly account for the predominant role of horizontal gene transfer in the diversification of protein families...|$|R
40|$|Bacteriophage D 108 is a temperate, <b>transposable,</b> mutator <b>phage</b> {{similar to}} phage Mu. These {{heteroimmune}} phages have 37 kb linear, double-stranded DNA genomes which are over 90 % homologous. We have isolated four independent insertions {{of an entire}} thermoinducible D 108 c ts 10 phage genome in the low-copy plasmid pSC 101. We also characterized a previously isolated Mu c ts 62 insertion in the same plasmid replicon. Fine-structure analysis of these insertions showed that lytically transposing Mu and D 108 genomes caused 5 bp duplications of the target site. In addition, we cloned and sequenced the terminal 800 bp of the right end of D 108, a region important for the transposition of the phage genome. This analysis has delineated the critical DNA sequences required for D 108 transposition, and has also indicated that these sequences are not entirely homologous to those of phage Mu, {{despite the fact that}} the phages can transpose each other's DNA. Moreover, a 520 bp insertion of DNA found in the right end of D 108, but not Mu, has also been characterized, and has begins 72 bp from the right end of D 108, immediately adjacent to the cis -acting sequences required for D 108 transposition. This insertion does not appear to be an insertion element, but rather an extra gene in the right end of D 108 whose function is apparently non-essential for D 108 growth. The sequence differences and rearrangements between Mu and D 108 in this region indicate a complex evolutionary relationship between these phages at their right extremities. In addition to characterizing the DNA differences between Mu and D 108, we have also examined a difference occurring at the protein level. The L gene products of Mu and D 108 have different molecular weights, but are encoded from a region of homology between the two phages. We cloned a region of D 108 DNA that was able to rescue amber mutations in the L gene of Mu by homologous recombination, but not complement Mu L amber phages in vivo. This region produced a gene product which was truncated at the carboxy terminus, but was able to cross-react with anti-Mu phage serum. The production of this truncated protein was lethal to growing Escherichia coli cells, apparently interfering with cell wall biosynthesis...|$|R
