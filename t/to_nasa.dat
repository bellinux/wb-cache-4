5|$|When Slayton {{submitted}} the proposed crew assignments <b>to</b> <b>NASA</b> headquarters, George Mueller turned {{them down on}} the grounds that the crew was too inexperienced. So Slayton asked Jim Lovell, who had been the backup commander for Apollo 11, and was slated to command Apollo 14, if his crew would be willing to fly Apollo 13 instead. He agreed to do so, and Shepard's inexperienced crew was assigned to Apollo 14.|$|E

5|$|A comet-impact {{mission was}} first {{proposed}} <b>to</b> <b>NASA</b> in 1996, {{but at the}} time, NASA engineers were skeptical that the target could be hit. In 1999, a revised and technologically upgraded mission proposal, dubbed Deep Impact, was accepted and funded as part of NASA's Discovery Program of low-cost spacecraft. The two spacecraft (Impactor and Flyby) and the three main instruments were built and integrated by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. in Boulder, Colorado. Developing the software for the spacecraft took 18 months and the application code consisted of 20,000 lines and 19 different application threads. The total cost of developing the spacecraft and completing its mission reached US$330million.|$|E
5|$|Based on his {{industry}} {{experience on}} Air Force missile projects, Mueller realized some skilled managers {{could be found}} among high-ranking officers in the United States Air Force, so he got Webb's permission to recruit General Samuel C. Phillips, who gained a reputation for his effective management of the Minuteman program, as OMSF program controller. Phillips' superior officer Bernard A. Schriever agreed to loan Phillips <b>to</b> <b>NASA,</b> along {{with a staff of}} officers under him, on the condition that Phillips be made Apollo Program Director. Mueller agreed, and Phillips managed Apollo from January 1964, until it achieved the first manned landing in July 1969, after which he returned to Air Force duty.|$|E

The Spitzer Space Telescope was also used. Kepler-11's planetary system became the first discovered extrasolar system with more than three transiting planets, as well as the most compact and flattest system yet discovered, according <b>to</b> <b>NASA.</b> The planets of Kepler-11, including Kepler-11e, were announced jointly at a press conference on February 2, 2011.

5|$|In {{planning}} for Apollo 8, {{one of the}} responsibilities Kraft faced was ensuring that a fleet would be waiting to recover the crew when they splashed {{down at the end}} of the mission. This proved an unusual challenge, because much of the Pacific fleet of the US Navy would be on leave over the Christmas and New Year's Eve period. Kraft had to personally meet with Admiral John McCain in order to persuade him to make the requisite resources available <b>to</b> <b>NASA.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully travel <b>to</b> <b>NASA</b> {{and meet}} Belt, a {{childhood}} hero of Mulder's. Belt, who now manages the shuttle program, dismisses the agents' concerns and states {{that nothing can}} possibly go wrong with the mission. He allows the agents to watch the launch from Mission Control. The launch is successful. As the agents are leaving however, Generoo informs them that contact is lost with the shuttle in orbit. While driving back to Mission Control, Generoo sees the face come at her through her windshield, causing her to crash her car.|$|E

5|$|Of the 640,000 {{individual}} pixels that compose each frame, Earth {{takes up}} less than one (0.12 pixels, according <b>to</b> <b>NASA).</b> The light bands across the photograph are an artifact, the result of sunlight scattering off parts of the camera and its sunshade, due to the relative proximity between the Sun and the Earth. Voyager's point of view was approximately 32Â° above the ecliptic. Detailed analysis suggested that the camera also detected the Moon, although it is too faint to be visible without special processing.|$|E
5|$|On August 9, Gilruth, Low, Kraft and Slayton flew to Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, {{where they}} briefed NASA {{managers}} including Wernher von Braun and Rocco Petrone on the planned mission. On August 14, they, {{along with the}} Huntsville group, traveled <b>to</b> <b>NASA</b> Headquarters in Washington D.C. to brief Deputy Administrator Thomas O. Paine. In turn, Paine recommended the mission to Administrator James E. Webb, who gave Kraft and his colleagues the authority to begin preparations for the mission.|$|E
5|$|Several Gemini Ferry {{spacecraft}} were {{proposed to}} provide transportation of crews and cargo <b>to</b> <b>NASA</b> and USAF space stations in low Earth orbit. NASA contracted McDonnell {{to conduct a}} study into what modifications {{would be needed to}} allow the Gemini spacecraft to support this. Three spacecraft were envisioned; a manned spacecraft to transport crew to the stations, a manned spacecraft with a cargo module for both crew and cargo delivery, and a dedicated unmanned spacecraft to resupply the station every three or four months.|$|E

After Tri-Service evaluation they were passed to the USAF for further evaluation at Edwards Air Force Base, except for two that were assigned <b>to</b> <b>NASA.</b> One of the two remaining British-based Kestrels {{was attached to the}} Blind Landing Experimental Unit (BLEU) at RAE Bedford and the other, XS693, went to Blackburn for modification to take the uprated Pegasus 6 engine.|$|E
5|$|The MOL {{program was}} {{cancelled}} on 10 June 1969, {{in favour of}} unmanned reconnaissance satellites. Some systems developed for the program were later used on unmanned missions, while the space suits which were under development were transferred <b>to</b> <b>NASA.</b> The Titan IIIM rocket which was to launch MOL never flew, however some of the upgrades that were built into it were later used to upgrade other Titan rockets â the stretched first and second stages became the Titan 34, which {{was used as the}} core of some later Titan IIIB flights, and on the Titan 34D. The seven-segment solid rocket boosters were later introduced on the Titan IVA.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the crash}} {{did not affect}} space flight {{operations}} and the spacecraft itself was undamagedâit was shipped <b>to</b> <b>NASA</b> {{two days after the}} crashâthe accident caused neither delays nor engineering changes in the U.S. space program. However, the loss of the Gemini 9 crew did cause NASA to reshuffle the crew assignments for subsequent Gemini and Apollo missions; Stafford and Cernan were moved up to the primary position for Gemini 9, re-designated Gemini 9A. Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin, who had formerly been the backup for Gemini 10, became the back-up crew for Gemini 9A, and through the normal rotation were then assigned as prime crew for Gemini 12. Without experience during the Gemini mission, Buzz Aldrin would have been an unlikely choice for the Apollo 11 mission, during which he became the second man to walk on the Moon.|$|E
