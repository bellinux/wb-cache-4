25|$|In 2000 the briefly reconstituted D'Oyly Carte Opera Company {{produced}} H.M.S. Pinafore at the theatre.

In 2002, a season of Return to the Forbidden Planet {{was followed by the}} D'Oyly Carte productions of Iolanthe, The Yeomen of the Guard and The Mikado, and then a revival of Yasmina Reza's Life x 3. In 2003, the company revived Pinafore, followed by Bea Arthur at The Savoy, John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, Peter Pan and Pirates. These were followed by The Marriage of Figaro and The Barber of Seville performed by The Savoy Opera Company in 2004.

25|$|When I {{became a}} member of the law firm of Steger, Thurmond and Rayburn, Messrs. Thurmond and Steger were {{representing}} the Santa Fe Railroad Company, receiving pay monthly. When the first check came after I entered the firm, Mr. Thurmond brought to my desk one-third of the amount of the check, explaining what it was for. I said to him that I was a member of the Legislature, representing the people of Fannin County, and that my experience had <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> that men who represent the people should be as far removed as possible from concerns whose interests he was liable to be called on to legislate concerning, and that on that ground I would not accept a dollar of the railroad's money, though I was legally entitled to it. I never did take a dollar of it. I have been guided by the principle in all my dealings.|$|E

He also claimed numerous other romances, although he did not discuss his marriages, his wives, or his children in his autobiography. As a young man he was a family friend of Stella Adler's, whose daughter Ellen was a roommate of novelist Paula Fox. For a while, Brando and Fox lived under one roof and became close. Brando may have been the father of Fox's first child, daughter Linda Carroll, who was born in 1944. Linda was given up for adoption and is the mother of Courtney Love. Fox never named the child's father or addressed the affair.|$|E

We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child.

25|$|Nevertheless, Farmer {{focused the}} efforts of the {{institution}} on Bahá'í themes. In her words in 1902:My joy in the Persian Revelation is not that it reveals one of the streams flowing to the great Ocean of Life, Light and Love, but that it is a perfect mirror of that Ocean. What, in Green Acre, was a vision and a hope becomes, through it a blessed reality now. It has illuminated for me every other expression of Truth which I had hitherto known and place my feet on a Rock from which they cannot be moved. And it is the Manifestation of the Fatherhood - Behá'u'lláh (ed - as it was spelled in those days) - who had <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> to look away from even the Greatest and find within the One 'Powerful, Mighty, and Supreme' who is to be the Redeemer of my life. It is a Revelation of Unity such as I had never before found. By means of its Light, as shown the life of the Master Abbas Abdul Beha, I have entered into a joy greater than any I have hitherto known. Green Acre was established as a means to that end and in proportion as well lay aside all spirit of criticism of others and seek only to live the Unity we find, shall we be able to help others to the same divine realization.|$|E
25|$|Head first {{showed his}} talent for {{teaching}} {{at the age of}} 21 when he addressed the Stoke Newington Mutual Instruction Society at the Friends Meeting House, Park Street, on the fertilization of plants. Professor H. M. Turnbull writes of Head's devotion to teaching:I had the good fortune when first going to the hospital to meet daily in the mornings on the steam engine underground railway Dr. Henry Head. He told me to buy Gee's little book on percussion, and kindly <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> throughout our journeys about physical signs, much to the annoyance of our fellow travellers; indeed in his characteristic keenness he spoke so loudly that as we walked to the hospital from St. Mary's station {{people on the other side}} of the wide Whitechapel Road would turn to look at us. I was greatly interested in the central nervous system when learning physiology and anatomy, and so I enjoyed greatly my three months as a clerk to him, his sessions in the out-patient department, and his wonderful demonstrations on clinical evenings.... He devoted a great deal of time to teaching. In his rounds of the wards his clerks read the histories and examinations they had written, and he criticized even the English. He did not confine himself to nervous diseases, but took more pains than any other physician for whom I clerked to teach us physical signs and – how to examine patients of all kinds. He was a little too anxious to get exactly correct results when demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the 'say when' would become a little more rapid and insistent, as the correct boundary was approached.|$|E

500|$|Following Langford's {{death in}} May 1927, Cardus became The Manchester Guardians chief music critic. For several {{years he had}} worked closely with Langford, whose {{influence}} on the younger man was equalled only by that of Ernest Newman, Langford's predecessor as the paper's music critic: [...] "Langford <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> to feel and translate, while Newman <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> to observe and analyse". Cardus's fellow-critic Hugo Cole has described his approach as personal rather than academic, based on his own reactions to the music he was hearing, and with a complete independence of judgement. Cardus was, Cole says, [...] "the last distinguished music critic never to have received formal musical training... he was a writer first, and a music critic second".|$|E
5000|$|Born in Gloucestershire, Reid {{obtained}} his BA {{degree in}} languages from Cambridge University, {{after which he}} taught in English high schools. [...] He went on to conduct curriculum research at the University of Birmingham, where he obtained his Ph.D and subsequently <b>taught</b> <b>M.Ed.</b> students. He took early retirement from the University of Birmingham in 1988 and was appointed as a visiting professor at the London Institute of Education, and subsequently the University of Texas, Austin. He also undertook collaborative projects with colleagues at the University of Oslo and taught summer schools at the University of Victoria, British Columbia. Some of his reminiscences were published in 2009 in [...] "Leaders in Curriculum Studies", edited by E.C. Short and L.J. Waks (Sense Publishers, Rotterdam, 2009).

500|$|Newton likely {{introduced}} her to the writings of William Wordsworth, and his gift to her of Ralph Waldo Emerson's first book of collected poems had a liberating effect. She wrote later that he, [...] "whose name my Father's Law Student <b>taught</b> <b>me,</b> has touched the secret Spring". Newton held her in high regard, believing in and recognizing her as a poet. When he was dying of tuberculosis, he wrote to her, saying {{that he would like}} to live until she achieved the greatness he foresaw.

500|$|Taube {{was born}} November 30, 1915 in Neudorf, Saskatchewan as the {{youngest}} of four boys. [...] His parents were German ethnics from Ukraine which had immigrated to Saskatchewan from the Ukraine in 1911. [...] Growing up, his first language was Low German. [...] In the 1700s, Catherine the Great encouraged Central European farmers to settle in Russia. [...] As the rights afforded to these settlers by Catherine were gradually diminished, many of the settlers headed to North America, with Saskatchewan offering good farmland, and other incentives for immigrants. Taube reflected fondly on his experiences growing up in Saskatchewan, noting: [...] "Certainly, there is nothing about my first 21 years in Saskatchewan, taken {{in the context of}} those times that I would wish to be changed. [...] The advantages that I enjoyed include: [...] the marvelous experience of growing up on a farm, which <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> an appreciation of nature, and <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> also to discipline myself to get necessary jobs done..." ...|$|E

[...] "Thou art gone, my brave commander, my gallant commander," [...] he said, standing suddenly upright, and stretching his long arms over the corpse, [...] "thou art gone, and I doubt not I shall follow thee: but till that moment shall come, till a death, as honourable as thine own, shall release me from my promise, I swear that I will not disgrace the high station which thy departure obliges me to fill. It was thou who first tutored my unaccustomed arm to wield the sword; it was thou who badest me hear unmoved the thunder of an enemy's artillery; it was thou who <b>taughtest</b> <b>me</b> all I know of military tactics, {{and the art of}} war. Rest in peace, dear friend, dearest of instructors, I will not disgrace thy precepts." [...] And so finishing, he stooped down, kissed the face of the dead body which he apostrophized, made a cross on the bosom, and muttered a fervent prayer for the welfare of the departed soul.|$|R
