5|$|Acqua & Sapone rider Dario Andriotto set {{the early}} time to beat. After a while, Yuriy Krivtsov bested his time. Several {{different}} riders in succession then posted successively (but, {{in the first}} few cases, marginally) better times <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> time that had come before them. Alessandro Bertolini, David Millar, Marco Pinotti, Giovanni Visconti, Bradley Wiggins, and Stefano Garzelli were all briefly the stage leader after they crossed the finish line. Bertolini in particular was stage leader for about three minutes, as Millar started just behind him and barely beat his time.|$|E

25|$|The International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) {{is based}} on {{hundreds}} of extra-galactic radio sources, mostly quasars, distributed around the entire sky. Because they are so distant, they are apparently stationary to our current technology, yet their positions can be measured with the utmost accuracy by Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). The positions of most are known to 0.001 arcsecond or better, which is orders of magnitude more precise <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> optical measurements.|$|E

25|$|Ranger's Block 3 {{embodied}} four launches in 1964-65. These spacecraft boasted {{a television}} instrument designed {{to observe the}} lunar surface during the approach; as the spacecraft neared the Moon, they would reveal detail smaller <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> Earth telescopes could show, and finally details down to dishpan size. The first of the new series, Ranger 6, had a flawless flight, except that the television system was disabled by an in-flight accident and could take no pictures.|$|E
25|$|Large {{quantities}} of pure CNTs {{can be made}} into a fiber (a.k.a. filament) by wet spinning. The fiber is either directly spun from the synthesis pot or spun from pre-made dissolved CNTs. Individual fibers can be turned into a yarn. Apart from its strength and flexibility, the main advantage is making an electrically conducting yarn. The electronic properties of individual CNT fibers (i.e. bundle of individual CNT) is governed by the two-dimensional structure of CNTs.. At 300 K, CNT fibers have a conductivity one order of magnitude higher <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> electrical conductors.|$|E
25|$|The DSSC has {{a number}} of {{attractive}} features; it is simple to make using conventional roll-printing techniques, is semi-flexible and semi-transparent which offers a variety of uses not applicable to glass-based systems, and most of the materials used are low-cost. In practice it has proven difficult to eliminate a number of expensive materials, notably platinum and ruthenium, and the liquid electrolyte presents a serious challenge to making a cell suitable for use in all weather. Although its conversion efficiency is less <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> thin-film cells, in theory its price/performance ratio should be good enough to allow them to compete with fossil fuel electrical generation by achieving grid parity. Commercial applications, which were held up due to chemical stability problems, are forecast in the European Union Photovoltaic Roadmap to significantly contribute to renewable electricity generation by 2020.|$|E

25|$|Public-key {{algorithms}} {{are based}} on the computational difficulty of various problems. The most famous of these is integer factorization (e.g., the RSA algorithm is based on a problem related to integer factoring), but the discrete logarithm problem is also important. Much public-key cryptanalysis concerns numerical algorithms for solving these computational problems, or some of them, efficiently (i.e., in a practical time). For instance, the best known algorithms for solving the elliptic curve-based version of discrete logarithm are much more time-consuming <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known algorithms for factoring, at least for problems of more or less equivalent size. Thus, other things being equal, to achieve an equivalent strength of attack resistance, factoring-based encryption techniques must use larger keys than elliptic curve techniques. For this reason, public-key cryptosystems based on elliptic curves have become popular since their invention in the mid-1990s.|$|E
25|$|Members of the fathers' rights {{movement}} {{campaign for the}} reform of child support guidelines, which in most Western countries are based on maintaining the children's standard of living after separation, and {{on the assumption that}} the children live with one parent and never with the other. Activists state that the current guidelines are arbitrary, provide mothers with financial incentives to divorce, and leave fathers with little discretionary income to enjoy with the children during their parenting time. In the US, fathers' rights activists propose guidelines based on a Cost Shares model, in which child support would be based on the average income of the parents and the estimated child costs incurred by both parents. Laura W. Morgan has stated that it focuses on the relative living standards of divorcing parents rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> interests of the children and financially supporting them at the same level after divorce.|$|E
25|$|Node lookups {{can proceed}} asynchronously. The {{quantity}} of simultaneous lookups is denoted by α and is typically three. A node initiates a FIND_NODE request by querying to the α nodes {{in its own}} k-buckets that are the closest ones to the desired key. When these recipient nodes receive the request, they will look in their k-buckets and return the k closest nodes to the desired key that they know. The requester will update a results list with the results (node ID's) he receives, keeping the k best ones (the k nodes that are closer to the searched key) that respond to queries. Then the requester will select these k best results and issue the request to them, and iterate this process again and again. Because every node has a better knowledge of his own surroundings than any other node has, the received results will be other nodes that are every time {{closer and closer to}} the searched key. The iterations continue until no nodes are returned that are closer <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> previous results. When the iterations stop, the best k nodes in the results list are the ones in the whole network that are the closest to the desired key.|$|E

25|$|The 21st All-Star Game {{one year}} later was somber {{compared}} to the 20 before it, as {{the days before the}} game were tragic. On January 14, 1968, two days before the game, Bill Masterton had been checked by two Oakland Seals players and died from his on-ice injuries. The game itself was overshadowed by the debate on whether helmets should be worn in the NHL in the fallout of Masterton's untimely death. As in the previous years, the All-Stars were represented by the First and Second All-Star teams, as well as enough players so that each team was represented. The East-West format of future All-Star Games was announced in the 21st All-Star Game, with the intention of being able to move the game anywhere, alternating home ice between an East division team and a West division team year after year. The idea, along with the notion that the players chosen for the two All-Star teams should be the best {{at the time of the}} game rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> of the players from the season before, quickly gained popularity, although the Cup champions reserved the right to host the 22nd All-Star Game. The St. Louis Blues became the first Western host of the All-Star Game the following year. The 26th All-Star Game was the first in which the game MVP received a car as a prize.|$|E
25|$|In 1957 Fangio {{returned}} to Maserati, {{who were still}} using the same iconic 250F which Fangio had driven {{at the start of}} 1954. Fangio started the season with a hat-trick of wins in Argentina, Monaco and France, before retiring with engine problems in Britain. At the next race, the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring circuit, Fangio needed to extend his lead by six points to claim the title with two races to spare. From pole position Fangio dropped to third behind the Ferraris of Mike Hawthorn and Collins but managed to get past both {{by the end of the}} third lap. Fangio had started with half-full tanks since he expected that he would need new tyres halfway through the race. In the event Fangio pitted on lap 13 with a 30-second lead, but a disastrous stop left him back in third place and 50 seconds behind Collins and Hawthorn. Fangio came into his own, setting one fastest lap after another, culminating in a record-breaking time on lap 20 a full eleven seconds faster <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> the Ferraris could do. On the penultimate lap Fangio got back past both Collins and Hawthorn, and held on to take the win by just over three seconds. With Musso finishing down in fourth place, Fangio claimed his fifth title. This performance is often regarded as the greatest drive in Formula One history, and it was to be Fangio's last win.|$|E
