40|$|Float {{coal dust}} is {{produced}} by various mining methods, carried by ventilating air and deposited on the floor, roof and ribs of mine airways. If deposited, float dust is re-entrained during a methane explosion. Without sufficient inert rock dust quantities, this float coal dust can propagate an explosion throughout mining entries. Consequently, controlling float coal dust is of critical interest to mining operations. Rock dusting, which is the adding of inert material to airway surfaces, is the main control technique currently used by the coal mining industry to reduce the float coal dust explosion hazard. To assist the industry in reducing this hazard, the Pittsburgh Mining Research Division of the U. S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health initiated a project to investigate methods and technologies to reduce float coal dust in underground coal mines through prevention, capture and suppression prior to deposition. Field characterization studies were performed to determine quantitatively the sources, types and amounts of dust produced during various coal mining processes. The operations chosen for study were a continuous miner section, a longwall section and a coal-handling facility. For each of these operations, the primary dust sources were confirmed to be the continuous mining machine, longwall shearer and conveyor belt transfer points, respectively. Respirable and <b>total</b> airborne <b>float</b> dust samples were collected and analyzed for each operation, and the ratio of <b>total</b> airborne <b>float</b> coal dust to respirable dust was calculated.

5000|$|Using these values, CPM calculates {{the longest}} path of planned {{activities}} to logical end points {{or to the}} end of the project, and the earliest and latest that each activity can start and finish without making the project longer. This process determines which activities are [...] "critical" [...] (i.e., on the longest path) and which have [...] "total float" [...] (i.e., can be delayed without making the project longer). In project management, a critical path is the sequence of project network activities which add up to the longest overall duration, regardless if that longest duration has float or not. This determines the shortest time possible to complete the project. There can be 'total float' (unused time) within the critical path. For example, if a project is testing a solar panel and task 'B' requires 'sunrise', there could be a scheduling constraint on the testing activity so that it would not start until the scheduled time for sunrise. This might insert dead time (<b>total</b> <b>float)</b> into the schedule on the activities on that path prior to the sunrise due to needing to wait for this event. This path, with the constraint-generated <b>total</b> <b>float</b> would actually make the path longer, with <b>total</b> <b>float</b> being part of the shortest possible duration for the overall project. In other words, individual tasks on the critical path prior to the constraint might be able to be delayed without elongating the critical path; this is the 'total float' of that task. However, the time added to the project duration by the constraint is actually critical path drag, the amount by which the project's duration is extended by each critical path activity and constraint.|$|E

The theory helps to compute path lengths using activity floats and analyze activity floats using paths, which helps to transmute a problem into the other simpler one. We discussed applications of the float-path theory and applied it to solve the time-cost tradeoff problem (TCTP), especially the nonlinear and discrete versions. We proposed a simplification from an angle of path as a preprocessing technique for the TCTP. The simplification is a difficult path problem, but we transformed it into a simple float problem using the float-path theory. We designed a polynomial algorithm for the simplification, and then the TCTP may be solved more efficiently...|$|R

The oral delivery of antihypertensive propranolol HCl was facilitated by preparing an effervescent floating dosage form which could increase its absorption in the stomach by in-creasing the drug’s gastric residence time. In the present work, effervescent floating tablets were prepared with a hydrophilic carrier such as polyethylene oxide (PEO WSR N 60 K and PEO WSR 303) as a release retarding agent and sodium bicarbonate as a gas generating agent. The prepared tablets were eval-uated for all their physicochemical properties, in vitro buoyancy, drug release and rate order kinetics.

5000|$|A {{quick way}} to compute the drag of a {{critical}} path activity that has one or more start-to-start or start-to-start plus lag successorsis that the drag of the critical path activity that has such successors will be equal to whichever is less: {{the duration of the}} predecessor activity OR the sum of the lag plus <b>total</b> <b>float</b> of whichever SS successor has the LEAST lag plus <b>total</b> <b>float.</b> This is shown in the diagram where Activity A has four SS+lag successors: B, C, E, and F.
