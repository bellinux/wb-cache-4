One of the most frustrating complications in the treatment of hemophilia then, was the development of inhibitors to Factor VIII or Factor IX, which neutralized the activity of the factor given for treatment. Prothrombin complex concentrates had been used since the 1970s as a bypassing agent in a few anecdotal cases of hemophilia with inhibitor development, but their efficacy had not been fully established. Lusher was able to demonstrate their efficacy in the treatment of joint bleeding in hemophilia in two multi-center studies in the early 1980s. Lusher later conducted the first studies on the use of recombinant factor VIIa in the treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia. As this product was safer than prothrombin complex concentrates, and could be administered at home by the patients themselves, she and colleagues promoted its use in patients with inhibitors to treat bleeding episodes.|$|E

In the current study, we tested BDDpfVIII activity after nonmyeloablative conditioning with busulfan, cyclophosphamide, or fludarabine and immunosuppressive agents CTLA 4 -Ig + anti-CD 40 L or anti-(murine) thymocyte serum (ATS).

40|$|Hemophilia is a {{bleeding}} disorder caused by mutations {{in the genes}} encoding coagulation Factor VIII (FVIII) or FIX. Current treatment is through intravenous infusion of the missing protein. The major complication of treatment {{is the development of}} neutralizing Ab’s to the clotting factor. Infusion of recombinant activated human Factor VII (rhFVIIa), driving procoagulant reactions independently of human FVIII (hFVIII) or hFIX, has been successful in such patients and could in theory provide hemostasis in all hemophilia patients. However, its high cost and short half-life have limited its use. Here, we report a novel treatment strategy with a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector delivering a modified FVII transgene that can be intracellularly processed and secreted as activated FVII (FVIIa).

40|$|Hemophilia A is an X chromosome-linked {{bleeding}} disorder {{caused by a}} reduction or com­plete absence of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). The bleeding tendency in patients suffering from hemophilia A can be treated by regular intravenous administrations of FVIII. A severe complication that occurs in approximately 30 % of hemophilia A patients is the recognition of administered FVIII as “non-self” by the recipients’ immune system, leading {{to the formation of}} FVIII-neutralizing antibodies. The initial steps in the formation of these antibodies are recognition and uptake of the administered FVIII by antigen-presenting cells, which is followed by presentation of FVIII fragments to the immune system on MHC class II complexes. In this thesis the mechanism of FVIII endocytosis and presentation on MHC class II by antigen-presenting cells was investigated. The thesis describes that the uptake of FVIII by antigen-presenting cells can be inhibited by shielding or modifying certain amino acids in the C 1 domain of FVIII. A FVIII variant was constructed that is less immunogenic. Administration of this FVIII variant to hemophilic mice led to significantly less antibody formation than administration of normal FVIII. Additionally, it was shown that recognition of FVIII by antigen-presenting cells leads to donor-dependent differences in the presentation of FVIII fragments on MHC class II.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Hemophilia {{is caused}} by {{deficiencies}} in coagulation factor VIII or IX, resulting in direct blockade of the intrinsic tenase complex and indirect blockade of the extrinsic tenase complex which is rapidly inhibited upon binding of factor Xa to tissue factor pathway inhibitor. We evaluated the ability of Gla-domainless factor Xa, a truncated form of factor Xa devoid of procoagulant properties, to bind to tissue factor pathway inhibitor and to alleviate the physiological inhibition of the extrinsic tenase. DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a thrombin generation assay triggered by a low concentration of tissue factor, we evaluated the ability of Gla-domainless factor Xa to restore blood coagulation in plasma from hemophilia A and B patients without and with inhibitors. We then compared its efficacy to generate thrombin to depletion of antithrombin or tissue factor pathway inhibitor by specific antibodies. Finally, we compared the kinetics of neutralization of factor Xa and Gla-domainless factor Xa by antithrombin and tissue factor pathway inhibitor. RESULTS: Gla-domainless factor Xa was able to restore thrombin generation in plasma samples from hemophiliacs. This effect was observed <b>for</b> plasma from <b>hemophilia</b> A patients without or with inhibitors and <b>for</b> plasma from <b>hemophilia</b> B patients. Gla-domainless factor Xa had a lower affinity than factor Xa for tissue factor pathway inhibitor whereas the affinities of both proteins for antithrombin were similar. Finally, despite a short half-life in plasma, the effect of Gla-domainless factor Xa on thrombin generation was sustained for at least 1 hour. CONCLUSIONS: As Gla-domainless factor Xa was able to restore thrombin generation in plasma from hemophilia patients, our results suggest {{that it may be}} an effective alternative to current <b>treatments</b> <b>for</b> <b>hemophilia</b> with or without an inhibitor...|$|R

40|$|Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) {{has been}} {{developed}} for treatment of bleeding in patients with hemophilia who have inhibitors against factor VIII (FVIII) or FIX, and {{has been found to}} induce hemostasis during major orthopedic surgery. The use of rFVIIa <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> <b>hemophilia</b> is a new concept and is based on the low-affinity binding of FVIIa to the surface of thrombin-activated platelets. Administration of pharmacologic doses of exogenous rFVIIa enhances thrombin generation on the platelet surface at the site of injury independently of the presence of FVIII or FIX. Pharmacologic doses of rFVIIa induce hemostasis not only in hemophilia patients, but also in patients with thrombocytopenia, functional platelet defects, and with profuse bleeding triggered by extensive surgery or trauma. The general mechanism of action of rFVIIa to induce hemostasis under these conditions may be its capacity to generate a tight fibrin hemostatic plug through increased thrombin generation. A tight fibrin plug will aid in resisting the overwhelming local release of fibrinolytic activity triggered by vast tissue damage occurring in extensive trauma. Local fibrinolytic activity also occurs in the gastrointestinal tract as well as during profuse postpartum bleeding. Pharmacologic doses of rFVIIa induce hemostasis in these cases also...|$|E
40|$|Hemophilia A is an X-linked {{recessive}} {{genetic disorder}} caused by mutations in the gene coding for the Factor VIII (F 8).

Secondary prophylaxis, whenever started, aims to avoid (or delay) the progression of arthropathy and improve patient quality of life. Interestingly, recent data suggest a role for early prophylaxis also in preventing development of inhibitors, the most serious complication of treatment in hemophilia, in which multiple genetic and environmental factors may be involved. Treatment of bleeds in patients with inhibitors requires bypassing agents (activated prothrombin complex concentrates, recombinant factor VIIa). However, eradication of inhibitors by induction of immune tolerance should be the first choice for patients with recent onset inhibitors.

We demonstrate that short-term therapy with an anti-ICOS monoclonal antibody to transiently block the inducible costimulator/inducible costimulator ligand (ICOS/ICOSL) signaling pathway led to sustained tolerance to hFVIII in hFVIII plasmid–treated hemophilia A mice and allowed persistent, high-level FVIII functional activity (100 %- 300 % of normal). Anti-ICOS treatment resulted in depletion of ICOS+CD 4 + T cells and activation of CD 25 +Foxp 3 + Tregs in the peripheral blood, spleen, and lymph nodes. CD 4 + T cells from anti-ICOS–treated mice did not proliferate in response to hFVIII stimulation and produced high levels of regulatory cytokines, including interleukin- 10 and transforming growth factor-β. Moreover, CD 4 +CD 25 + Tregs from tolerized mice adoptively transferred dominant tolerance in syngeneic hFVIII plasmid-treated hemophilia A mice and reduced the production of antibodies against FVIII. Anti-ICOS–treated mice tolerized to hFVIII generated normal primary and secondary antibody responses after immunization with the T-dependent antigen, bacteriophage Φx 174, indicating maintenance of immune competency.

40|$|Replacement {{therapy with}} factor VIII (FVIII) {{concentrates}} {{has become the}} mainstay of <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> <b>hemophilia,</b> but about 30 % of patients with a severe disease develop neutralizing antibodies against FVIII, {{which can lead to}} treatment resistance and an increased risk of bleeding. Immune tolerance induction (ITI) overcomes the immune response to FVIII concentrates in the majority of patients. Several factors may influence the efficacy of ITI, including disease-related factors (e. g. peak inhibitor titer and pre-ITI titer), and genetic factors (e. g. type of mutation). Treatment-related factors, such as the type of FVIII concentrate used in ITI will also potentially influence the outcome. Specifically, higher success rates with von Willebrand factor (VWF) -containing factor VIII concentrates than with high-purity FVIII concentrates have been reported, but further studies are needed. Potential mechanisms involved include steric hindrance, inhibition of FVIII degradation, or immunomodulatory effects. However, the exact mechanism by which immune tolerance is induced remains unclear. High-dose FVIII ITI appears to induce immune tolerance more rapidly than low-dose protocols and with a reduced risk of bleeding episodes. The addition of immunosuppressive therapy, such as rituximab, to ITI may improve outcomes, although the optimal approach to combined ITI/immunosuppression has not been established. Ongoing studies are likely to provide further insight into the role of genetic features and the type of FVIII concentrate on the success rate of ITI. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Hemophilia A and B are X-linked {{monogenic}} disorders {{caused by}} deficiencies in coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX (FIX), respectively. Current <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> <b>hemophilia</b> involves intravenous infusion of clotting factor concentrates. However, {{this does not}} constitute a cure, {{and the development of}} gene-based therapies for hemophilia to achieve prolonged high level expression of clotting factors to correct the bleeding diathesis are warranted. Different types of viral and nonviral gene delivery systems and a wide range of different target cells, including hepatocytes, skeletal muscle cells, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and endothelial cells, have been explored for hemophilia gene therapy. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) -based and lentiviral vectors are among the most promising vectors for hemophilia gene therapy. Stable correction of the bleeding phenotypes in hemophilia A and B was achieved in murine and canine models, and these promising preclinical studies prompted clinical trials in patients suffering from severe hemophilia. These studies recently resulted in the first demonstration that long-term expression of therapeutic FIX levels could be achieved in patients undergoing gene therapy. Despite this progress, there are still a number of hurdles that need to be overcome. In particular, the FIX levels obtained were insufficient to prevent bleeding induced by trauma or injury. Moreover, the gene-modified cells in these patients can become potential targets for immune destruction by effector T cells, specific for the AAV vector antigens. Consequently, more efficacious approaches are needed to achieve full hemostatic correction and to ultimately establish a cure for hemophilia A and B. © 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

Summary: Background B cells are attractive targets for gene therapy for diseases associated with B-cell dysfunction and particularly interesting for immunotherapy. Moreover, B cells are potent protein-secreting cells {{and can be}} tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells. Objective Evaluation of human B cells for secretion of clotting factors such as factor IX (FIX) as a possible <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> <b>hemophilia.</b> Methods We tested {{here for the first}} time our newly developed baboon envelope (BaEV) pseudotyped lentiviral vectors (LVs) for human (h) B-cell transduction following their adaptive transfer into an NOD/SCIDγc-/- (NSG) mouse. Results Upon B-cell receptor stimulation, BaEV-LVs transduced up to 80 % of hB cells, whereas vesicular stomatitis virus G protein VSV-G-LV only reached 5 %. Remarkably, BaEVTR-LVs permitted efficient transduction of 20 % of resting naive and 40 % of resting memory B cells. Importantly, BaEV-LVs reached up to 100 % transduction of human plasmocytes ex vivo. Adoptive transfer of BaEV-LV-transduced mature B cells into NOD/SCID/γc-/- (NSG) [non-obese diabetic (NOD), severe combined immuno-deficiency (SCID) ] mice allowed differentiation into plasmablasts and plasma B cells, confirming a sustained high-level gene marking in vivo. As proof of principle, we assessed BaEV-LV for transfer of human factor IX (hFIX) into B cells. BaEV-LVs encoding FIX efficiently transduced hB cells and their transfer into NSG mice demonstrated for the first time secretion of functional hFIX from hB cells at therapeutic levels in vivo.

40|$|Hemophilia A is {{the most}} common, {{inherited}} severe bleeding diathesis and {{is due to a}} deficiency of functional Factor (F) VIII. Two challenges to current FVIII replacement therapy are maintaining sustained FVIII corrections and treating the 30 % population of Hemophilia A patients who develop FVIII inhibitors. Gene therapy promises to be an attractive <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> <b>hemophilia</b> A as there is a wide therapeutic window for FVIII corrective plasma levels. Since platelets target to hemostatic injuries, ectopically expressed platelet (p) FVIII is an attractive alternative FVIII delivery strategy. We have already shown the effectiveness of platelet human B-domainless factor VIII (phBF 8) in the presence of circulating inhibitors in FVIIInull mice. However, the clots formed are unstable and lead to increased embolization with phBF 8. This dissertation describes platelet-specific gene therapy using three FVIII variants with enhanced activity: inactivation resistant FVIII (IR 8), canine (c) B-domainless FVIII (cBF 8), and hBF 8 R 1645 H. Each improved clotting efficacy in FVIIInull mice and decreased embolic risk though to different degrees. For example, we found that despite pcBF 8 having ~ 30 % antigenic levels of phBF 8, it corrected clot instability seen in a cremaster injury model in FVIIInull mice. Since IR 8 does not bind FVIII carrier protein, Von Willebrand Factor (vWF), efficiently, we tested the effectiveness of this variant in the presence of circulating FVIII inhibitors, and found that vWF binding was not needed for IR 8 to be effective. To understand the cellular mechanism for decreased cBF 8 relative to hBF 8 expression level in megakaryocytes, we studied mRNA levels and the effect of pcBF 8 on megakaryopoiesis and found that the level of cBF 8 is related to increased cellular apoptosis. Finally to understand the mechanistic basis of pcBF 8 increased hemostatic effectiveness, we examined whether mutation of the cleavage site for the Golgi apparatus enzyme PACE/furin in hBF 8 to that of cBF 8, which increases the FVIII’s activity, would also enhance hBF 8 R 1645 H pFVIII activity and affirm that this occurs. These studies provide new insights into pFVIII during megakaryopoiesis and how to optimize pFVIII hemostatic efficacy that should be useful in translating this therapeutic model to a large animal hemophilia A model and future clinical trials. ...|$|E

Aim: To identify {{the relative importance of}} frequency of administration, efficacy, and other treatment characteristics among candidates for prophylactic <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> <b>hemophilia</b> A and B. Method: An Internet survey was conducted among hemophilia patients and the parents of pediatric hemophilia patients in Australia, Canada, and the US. A monadic conjoint task was included in the survey, which varied frequency of administration (three, two, or one time per week for hemophilia A; twice weekly, weekly, or biweekly for hemophilia B), efficacy (no bleeding or breakthrough bleeding once every 4  months, 6  months, or 12  months), diluent volume (3  mL vs 2. 5  mL for hemophilia A; 5  mL vs 3  mL for hemophilia B), vials per infusion (2 vs 1), reconstitution device (assembly required vs not), and manufacturer (established in hemophilia vs not). Respondents were asked their likelihood to switch from their current regimen to the presented treatment. Respondents were told to assume that other aspects of treatment, such as risk of inhibitor development, cost, and method of distribution, would remain the same. Results: A total of 89 patients and/or parents of children with hemophilia A participated; another 32 were included in the exercise for hemophilia B. Relative importance was 47 %, 24 %, and 18 % for frequency of administration, efficacy, and manufacturer, respectively, in hemophilia A; analogous values were 48 %, 26 %, and 21 % in hemophilia B.

Induction of a hematopoietic chimerism via bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a potent means for inducing immunological tolerance in solid organ transplantation. Objectives: We reasoned here that the same viral vector could be used firstly to transduce BM cells for inducing chimerism-associated transgene-specific immune tolerance and, secondly, for correcting protein deficiencies by vector-mediated systemic production of the deficient coagulation factor. Methods: Evaluation of strategies to induce B and T cell tolerance was performed using ex vivo gene transfer with lentiviral vectors encoding coagulation factor IX (FIX) or the SIINFEKL epitope of ovalbumin. Following induction of microchimerism via BMT, animals were challenged with in vivo gene transfer with lentiviral vectors. Results: The experimental approach prevented humoral immune response against FIX, resulting in persistence of therapeutic levels of circulating FIX after lentiviral-mediated gene transfer in vivo. In an ovalbumin model, we also demonstrated that this approach effectively tolerized the CD 8 + T cell compartment in an antigen-specific manner. Conclusions: These results provide the proof-of-concept that inducing a microchimerism by gene-modified BMT is a powerful tool to provide transgene-specific B and T cell tolerance in a gene therapy setting...|$|R

Additionally, we also report that endothelial cells transduced by this virus can produce high levels of biologically active factor IX.

Whereas the availability of these agents has greatly advanced the management of bleeding episodes in this population, timely administration of bypassing agents continues to be hampered {{by a number of}} practical limitations, including the need for refrigerated storage of the agent and its reconstitution at room temperature prior to administration, among others. In this review, the importance of early treatment of bleeds and factors that influence this more timely therapeutic approach are highlighted, together with the advantages offered by the use of a new formulation of recombinant activated factor VII that permits improved storage and portability, potentially optimizing timely bypassing agent administration.

40|$|Continuous nanostructures, such as electrospun nanofibers, {{embedded}} with proteins may synergistically present the topographical and biochemical signals to cells for tissue engineering applications. In this dissertation, co-axial electrospinning is introduced {{as a mean to}} efficiently encapsulate and release protein and live entities while producing a tissue engineering scaffold with uniaxial topography. In the first specific aim, aligned poly (caprolactone) nanofibers encapsulated with BSA and growth factors were produced to demonstrate controlled release and bioactivity retention properties. Control over release kinetics {{is achieved by}} incorporation of poly(ethylene glycol) as a porogen in the shell of the fibers. PEG leaches out in a concentration and molecular weight dependent fashion, leading to BSA release half-lives that range from 1 - 20 days. The second specific aim introduces the fabrication of virus and bacterial cell encapsulated electrospun fibers to achieve unique biological functionalization. Adenovirus encoding the gene for green fluorescent protein was efficiently encapsulated into the core of poly(caprolactone) fibers through co-axial electrospinning and subsequently released via the porogen-mediated process. Encapsulated bacterial cells were confined to fibers of varying core sizes, which provided an aqueous core environment for free mobility and allowed the bacterias to proliferate within the fibers. In the third specific aim, the differentiation of skeletal myoblasts on aligned electrospun polyurethane fibers and in the presence of electromechanical stimulation were systematically studied. Skeletal myoblasts cultured on aligned polyurethane (PU) fibers showed more pronounced elongation, better alignment, upregulation of contractile proteins and higher percentage of striated myotubes compared to those cultured on random PU fibers and film. In the last specific aim, the controlled release aspect of co-axial electrospun fibers were combined with skeletal tissue engineering to serve as a therapeutic implant for the treatment of hemophilia. A non-viral, tissue engineering approach were taken to stimulate local lymphatic or vascular system in order to enhance transport near the FVIII-producing implants to provide effective and sustained <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> <b>hemophilia</b> A. Stable FVIII-producing clones were engineered from isolated myoblasts and cultured on aligned, protein-releasing electrospun fibers to form skeletal myotubes. The implanted construct rapidly integrated with host tissue and selectively induced angiogenesis or lymphangiogenesis {{as a result of the}} encapsulated growth factors. Constructs inducing angiogenesis significantly enhanced the transport of produced FVIII and achieved hemophilia phenotypic correction over two months. The use of co-axial electrospun fibers to serve as controlled delivery and tissue engineering construct furthers the continued pursue of a more sophisticated and medically relevant implant scaffold design.

In the setting of chronic diseases, cost-utility analysis, which {{takes into account the}} beneficial effects of a given treatment/health care intervention in terms of health-related quality of life, {{is likely to be the}} most appropriate approach. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of immune tolerance induction (ITI) therapy with plasma-derived factor VIII concentrates versus on-demand treatment with recombinant-activated FVIIa (rFVIIa) in hemophilia A with high titer inhibitors from an Iranian Ministry of Health perspective. Methods: This study was based on the study of Knight et al, which evaluated the cost-effectiveness ratios of different <b>treatments</b> <b>for</b> <b>hemophilia</b> A with high-responding inhibitors. To adapt Knight et al&# 39;s results to the Iranian context, a few clinical parameters were varied, and cost data were replaced with the corresponding Iranian estimates of resource use. The time horizon of the analysis was 10 years. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed, varying the cost of the clotting factor, the drug dose, and the administration frequency, to test the robustness of the analysis. Results: Comparison of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios between the three ITI protocols and the on-demand regimen with rFVIIa shows that all three ITI protocols dominate the on-demand regimen with rFVIIa. Between the ITI protocols the low-dose ITI protocol dominates both the Bonn ITI protocol and the Malm&ouml; ITI protocol and would be the preferred ITI protocol. All of the three ITI protocols dominate the on-demand strategy, as they have both a lower average lifetime cost and higher quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. The cost per QALY gained for the Bonn ITI protocol compared with the Malm&ouml; ITI protocol was $ 249, 391. 84. The cost per QALY gained for the Bonn ITI protocol compared with the low-dose ITI protocol was $ 842, 307. 69. Conclusion: The results of data derived from our study suggest that the low-dose ITI protocol may be a less expensive and/or more cost-effective option compared with on-demand first-line treatment with rFVIIa.

40|$|Background Bone marrow {{transplantation}} (BMT) is nowadays used {{in various}} hematological disorders including leukemias. Hemophilia A & B are sex linked bleeding disorders {{in which there}} are various genetic abnormalities in factor VIII & IX genes. Among various hematological disorders, bleeding disorders mainly hemophilia in now widely treated using plasma derived and recombinant factor VIII & IX concentrates. Day to day transfusion of coagulation factor VIII & IX in current lifelong disorder is a burden for the patients and decrease their quality of life. Although infection of coagulation products with blood-borne viruses that was major concern in treatment of hemophilia has been eliminated nearly complete at the present time, but appearance of factor VIII & IX inhibitors are huge burdens in <b>treatment</b> of <b>hemophilia</b> <b>for</b> both clinicians and patients. In this day and age BMT has gathered new insight and acceptable <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> many hematological and non-hematological disorders. If BMT will be successful in treatment of hemophilia, it will improve quality of life (by nearly permanent treatment without necessary of daily treatment) and decrease mortality rate (by providing continuous coagulation factor level in blood system). The aim of current study was to determine current role of BMT in treatment of hemophilia A & B and evaluate current usage of BMT <b>for</b> <b>treatment</b> of <b>hemophilia</b> A & B. Methods literature review was done using following key words: “bone marrow transplantation & hemophilia”, “stem cells transplantation & hemophilia”, BMT & hemophilia” in PubMed search engine without any time restriction. In addition the literature search limited to English languages papers. Results After complete search, abstracts of 24 original papers obtained and among them full text of 18 full text of papers accessed. The review of current papers showed that although BMT has been used in a rare cases with hemophilia (mainly hemophilia with another blood disorder), it does not use commonly and currently in treatment of patients with hemophilia A at present time. Literature review showed that scientists now focused on bone marrow transplantation in mouse model of hemophilia.  Conclusion  The literature review showed that BMT at present time is not common medical procedure and it is now in animal models, stage.   Key Words: Bone marrow transplantation, Hemophilia, Treatment. ...|$|R
