In spring 1969, shortly before Morgan's retirement, Mexican-American and African-American student organizations presented {{a list of}} demands to university officials primarily urging increased recruitment of minority students and employees. The demonstrators' occupation of the Administration Building continued to the front lawn of Morgan's home. Students and university representatives took their concerns to state officials, but Colorado legislators rejected a subsequent university request for funds to support minority recruitment.|$|E

For this march, Kahn also ghost wrote the speech of A.Philip Randolph, the senior leader of <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> <b>movement</b> and the African-American labor movement. Kahn's analysis of <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> <b>movement</b> influenced Bayard Rustin (who was the nominal author of Kahn's1964–1965 essay [...] "Fromprotest topolitics"), Stokely Carmichael, [...] and WilliamJulius Wilson.|$|E

5000|$|The next {{development}} {{during this}} period was the [...] "Battle of the Bogside", in which confrontation with the police would reach a peak in Derry’s most militant Catholic ghetto. The first half of 1969 was an intense period of political conflict, of which Derry was the epicentre. On 12 August an Orange Order parade was scheduled {{to take place in}} Derry; it would pass near the Bogside area, spawning fears it would erupt into a sectarian bloodbath. Activists in Derry made provisions to limit this possibility by building barricades along the route and providing stewards. Activist Eamonn McCann worried about sectarian conflict usurping <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> emphasis of <b>the</b> <b>movement.</b> In a leaflet he circulated shortly before the event, McCann notes that despite <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> <b>movement’s</b> non-sectarian intentions: ...|$|R

In the 1960s President Lyndon Johnson appointed her as a goodwill ambassador to East Germany.|$|R

2500|$|... "Respect" [...] has {{appeared}} in dozens of films and still receives consistent play on radio stations. In the 1970s, Franklin's version of the song came to exemplify the feminist movement. Producer Wexler said in a Rolling Stone interview, that Franklin's song was [...] "global in its influence, with overtones of <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> <b>movement</b> and gender equality. It was an appeal for dignity." [...] Although she had numerous hits after [...] "Respect", and several before its release, the song became Franklin's signature song and her best-known recording. I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You was ranked eighty-third in Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003. A year later, [...] "Respect" [...] was fifth in the magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{experience}} {{of the civil rights}} movement, and the coalition of labor unions and other progressive forces, suggested that America was changing and that a mass movement of the democratic left was possible. In terms of electoral politics, Shachtman, Michael Harrington, and Kahn argued that it was a waste of effort to run electoral campaigns as [...] "Socialist Party" [...] candidates, against Democratic Party candidates. Instead, they advocated a political strategy called [...] "realignment," [...] that prioritized strengthening labor unions and other progressive organizations that were already active in the Democratic Party. Contributing to the day-to-day struggles of <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> <b>movement</b> and labor unions had gained socialists credibility and influence, and had helped to push politicians in the Democratic Party towards social-democratic positions, on civil rights and the War on Poverty.|$|E
2500|$|Small {{organizations}} {{associated with}} the Debs–Thomas Socialist Party have served as schools for the leadership of social-movement organizations, including <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> <b>movement</b> and the sixties radicalism. These organizations are now chiefly remembered because of their members' leadership of large organizations that directly influenced USA and international politics. After 1960 the party also functioned [...] "as an educational organization" [...] and [...] "a caucus of policy advocates on the left wing of the Democratic Party". Similarly, SDUSA was known {{mainly because of the}} activities of its members, many of whom publicly identified themselves as members of SDUSA. Members of SDUSA have served as officers for governmental, private, and not-for-profit organizations. A.Philip Randolph, Bayard Rustin, and Norman Hill were leaders of the Civil Rights Movement. Tom Kahn, Sandra Feldman, and Rachelle Horowitz were officers of labor unions. Carl Gershman and Penn Kemble served in governmental and non-governmental organizations, particularly in foreign policy. Philosopher Sidney Hook was a public intellectual.|$|E

[...] "It was an instrument, a radical instrument that could help advance the interests of African-Americans. It helped build <b>the</b> early <b>civil-rights</b> <b>movement</b> and independent trade union movement in the 1930s, '40s and '50s." [...] He said he left the party in 1962 after [...] "it became bureaucratic and corrupt".|$|R

In the fall of 1964, he organized a Friends of the SNCC/COFO in Paris, France, to support the work of <b>the</b> American <b>civil-rights</b> <b>movement.</b> He returned to America in 1965 to work in Natchez, Mississippi. He later became a public school teacher, a non-violence trainer for interpersonal and political movements, and a poet and literary translator.|$|R

2500|$|After {{the passage}} of the civil rights {{legislation}} of 1964–65, Rustin focused attention on the economic problems of working-class and unemployed African Americans, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> <b>movement</b> had left its period of [...] "protest" [...] and had entered an era of [...] "politics", in which the black community had to ally with the labor movement. Rustin became the head of the AFL–CIO's A.Philip Randolph Institute, which promoted the integration of formerly all-white unions and promoted the unionization of African Americans. The Institute under Rustin's leadership also advanced and campaigned for (from 1966 to 1968) A Freedom Budget for All Americans, linking the concepts of racial justice with economic justice. [...] Supported by over 200 prominent civil-rights activists, trade unionists, religious leaders, academics and others, it outlined a plan to eliminate poverty and unemployment in the United States within a ten-year period. Rustin became an honorary chairperson of the Socialist Party of America in 1972, before it changed its name to Social Democrats, USA (SDUSA); Rustin acted as national chairman of SDUSA during the 1970s. During the 1970s and 1980s, Rustin served on many humanitarian missions, such as aiding refugees from Communist Vietnam and Cambodia. At {{the time of his death}} in 1987, he was on a humanitarian mission in Haiti.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "radical flank effect" [...] {{was coined}} by Herbert H. Haines. In 1984, Haines found that {{moderate}} black organizations saw increased rather than decreased funding as the radical black movement emerged. In his 1988 Black Radicals and the Civil Rights Mainstream, 1954-1970, Haines challenged the prevailing view that confrontational and militant black activists created a [...] "white backlash" [...] against <b>the</b> more moderate <b>civil-rights</b> <b>movement.</b> Rather, Haines argued, [...] "the turmoil which the militants created was indispensable to black progress" [...] and helped mainstream civil-rights groups.|$|R

In 1972, after earning a B.F.A. at Otis, she began {{graduate}} studies there. When Carlos Almaraz enrolled in the graduate program that year, it {{marked the beginning of}} a long friendship and professional association as members of Los Four. Along with Almaraz, she became involved in <b>the</b> Chicano <b>civil-rights</b> <b>movement</b> and worked on such projects as the Chicano Moratorium Against the War. During her time at Otis, Hernández studied drawing with the renowned artist Charles White. White, an African-American artist had spent time in Mexico, and was an admirer of indigenous and Latin American art. Hernández attributes much of her success to the teachers and professors she had throughout high school and college in the arts, and she believes that they have made her the person she is today. In 1971, while working as the illustrator of the Aztlán Journal, published by the UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center, Hernández illustrated the first volume of poetry by the celebrated Mexican-American poet Alurista, Floricanto en Aztlán.

5000|$|Writing in The Chronicle of Higher Education, Christopher Phelps, {{associate}} professor of American studies in the School of American and Canadian Studies at the University of Nottingham wrote: Professional historians have often viewed Zinn's work with exasperation or condescension, and Zinn was no innocent in the dynamic. I stood against the wall for a Zinn talk at the University of Oregon {{around the time of}} the 1992 Columbus Quincentenary. Listening to Zinn, one would have thought historians still considered Samuel Eliot Morison's 1955 book on Columbus to be definitive. The crowd lapped it up, but Zinn knew better. He missed a chance to explain how the social movements of the 1960s and 1970s have transformed the writing and teaching of history, how his People's History did not spring out of thin air but was an effort to synthesize a widely shared shift in historical sensibilities. Zinn's historical theorizing, conflating objectivity with neutrality and position with bias, was no better.The critics would be churlish, however, not to acknowledge the moving example Zinn set in <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> and Vietnam <b>movements,</b> and they would be remiss not to note the value of A People's History, along with its limitations. Zinn told tales well, stories that, while familiar to historians, often remained unknown to wider publics. He challenged national pieties and encouraged critical reflection about received wisdom. He understood that America's various radicalisms, far from being [...] "un-American," [...] have propelled the nation toward more humane and democratic arrangements. And he sold two-million copies of a work of history in a culture that is increasingly unwilling to read and, consequently, unable to imagine its past very well.|$|R
5000|$|During {{and after}} that movement, however, {{factors such as the}} {{national}} Democratic Party's support for <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> <b>movement</b> and the national Republican Party's [...] "Southern strategy" [...] and support for the application of religious values to politics eroded the South's support for the Democrats.|$|E
