500|$|According to Will Friedwald, {{this song}} {{is an example of}} Charles vocalizing in what would ordinarily be an {{generally}} extraneous manner for dramatic effect by using a different voice <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> previously exhibited. He sang [...] "... not just using the squeak—using a whole new kind of squeak, in fact—for additional coloring on the sidelines, but making it the heart of the matter, literally squeaking out the words and notes in harmony with the Raelettes" [...] (his background singers).|$|E
500|$|... 1916 – [...] "Beale Street Blues". Blues song by W. C. Handy. Written {{about the}} lively black {{neighborhood}} in Memphis, Tennessee, the Beale Street, {{it was first}} recorded by Prince's Band in 1917. Earl Fuller's 1917 hit recording started Handy's commercial success as a composer, earning him more money in royalties <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen in one place. Gilda Gray's performance in the Broadway musical Gaieties of 1919 caused a sensation in Broadway circles previously unexposed to blues music. The song later became a signature tune of trombonist Jack Teagarden.|$|E

500|$|Henderson {{struggled}} {{to adjust to}} his new-found popularity. [...] While he appreciated the support from fans and the business opportunities it created, he grew increasingly frustrated over time as the attention intruded on his private life. [...] In his autobiography, Shooting for Glory, Henderson stated that the fame left him less satisfied <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> been. His frustrations with Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard, who Henderson felt was destroying the team, contributed to his developing an ulcer. (Henderson later admitted he was not mature enough {{at the time to}} deal with the acerbic Ballard). He briefly turned to alcohol as he {{struggled to}} deal with his situation. Henderson's professional career reached its lowest point during the 1972–73 NHL season. He had become depressed, and by December, had scored only six goals. [...] He struggled with a groin injury and played only 40 games for the Maple Leafs, who missed the playoffs.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway saw World War I as the [...] "central fact of our time". [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] {{hints at}} both {{widespread}} physical devastation and Nick's personal war and post-war experience, {{but neither of}} these central facts are directly mentioned. Hemingway scholar Joseph Flora makes the observation that Hemingway portrays Nick's character coping [...] "more meaningfully <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> done before, with the issues of life and death". Biographer Phillip Young sees the story as basically concerned {{with a description of}} a young man [...] "trying desperately to keep from going out of his mind." [...] Nick returns [...] wounded, and introduces a character type Hemingway used again in his later stories and novels. The theme of an unspecified wound is introduced, a device that was to culminate in Jake Barnes' character in The Sun Also Rises. Hemingway scholar William Adair suggests that Nick's war experience was different, and perhaps more traumatic than Hemingway's own, writing that Nick's unspecified wound should not be confused or automatically identified with Hemingway's wound.|$|E

[...] When on [...] "Don't Be Cruel" [...] Presley [...] "slides into a 'mmmmm' that marks the transition between the first two verses," [...] he shows [...] "how masterful his relaxed style really is." [...] Marsh describes the singing on [...] "Can't Help Falling in Love" [...] to be of [...] "gentle insistence and delicacy of phrasing," [...] with the line [...] "'Shall I stay'" [...] pronounced as if the words are fragile as crystal." [...] On the operatic [...] "It's Now or Never" [...] Presley [...] "was reaching for something more <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> attempted before," [...] and, according to discographer Jorgensen, later the same year the melody to [...] "Surrender", a number also based on an Italian original, [...] "Torna A Sorrento", [...] "required an even greater demonstration of vocal powers." ...|$|E

500|$|The Western Conference quarter-final series {{opened in}} Chicago; the first Blackhawk playoff games in seven years. The Flames dropped {{the first two}} games, each by {{identical}} 3–2 scores. [...] In both games, they played strong to start the games, earning 1–0 and 2–0 leads respectively before conceding the advantage. The Flames lost the first game after just 12 seconds of overtime. [...] An angry Flames team returned to Calgary for games three and four, promising to improve their play. [...] They won game three, 4–2, {{on the strength of}} Kiprusoff's 36-save performance in goal. The first three games of the series were physically intense and occasionally violent, prompting the league to warn both teams to tone down both the verbal attacks they were exchanging as well as to remain within the rules when engaging in scrums after the play ended. [...] TSN commentator Pierre McGuire, stationed between each team's benches, insisted that Iginla in particular had taken more verbal abuse <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen.

500|$|In the 1921 season, Waddington took 105 wickets at {{an average}} of 18.94. The {{introduction}} of the pace bowler George Macaulay into the team gave him more support, but according to a later edition of Wisden, Waddington's form was poor that year. The almanack's review of the 1921 season suggested that, when at full strength, Yorkshire had the best bowling attack in the championship, but the team finished third. Both Waddington and Yorkshire were more successful the following year: the county won the first of four successive championships, and Waddington took 133 wickets {{at an average}} of 16.08. He was often effective in the most important matches. Wisden suggested that [...] "Yorkshire were very good at every point, but their main strength lay in the excellence and variety of their bowling... was, on occasions, more successful against strong sides <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> been before. He had days of astonishing success and once, at least, bowled with a bewildering swerve [...] that recalled George Hirst at his best." [...] Among his best performances were figures of eight for 34 against Northamptonshire (the best of his career), seven wickets for six runs in a Sussex total of 20 and eight for 35 against Hampshire. His season ended with festival games at Eastbourne, where he represented the North against the South and played for a team of ex-Royal Air Force servicemen.|$|E
500|$|News of Biko's death {{spread quickly}} across the world, and became {{symbolic}} of the abuses of the apartheid system. His death attracted more global attention <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> attained during his lifetime. Protest meetings were held in several cities; many were shocked that the security authorities would kill such a prominent dissident leader. Biko's Anglican funeral service, held on 25 September 1977 at King William's Town's Victoria Stadium, took five hours and was attended by around 20,000 people. The vast majority were black, but a few hundred whites also attended, including Biko's friends, such as Russell and Woods, and prominent progressive figures like Helen Suzman, Alex Boraine, and Zach de Beer. Foreign diplomats from thirteen nations were present, as was an Anglican delegation headed by Bishop Desmond Tutu. The event was later described as [...] "the first mass political funeral in the country". Biko's coffin had been decorated with the motifs of a clenched black fist, the African continent, and the statement [...] "One Azania, One Nation"; Azania was the name that many activists wanted South Africa to adopt post-apartheid. Biko {{was buried in the}} cemetery at Ginsberg. Two BCM-affiliated artists, Dikobé Ben Martins and Robin Holmes, produced a T-shirt marking the event; the design was banned the following year. Martins also created a commemorative poster for the funeral, the first in a tradition of funeral posters that proved popular throughout the 1980s.|$|E

500|$|Kerry led off in {{a faster}} time than he had clocked in the {{individual}} event, {{but it was still}} two seconds slower than his personal best time of 57.87s, leaving Australia in fourth place {{at the end of the}} first leg. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s to put Australia in second place, almost level with the host nation at the halfway mark. Evans had out-split Goodhew by 0.8s and Miskarov by 0.5s. Tonelli then swam his leg in 54.94s, almost two seconds faster <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> done before. Tonelli began to lose ground in the last 50m and was a bodylength behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre of the lead by the end of his leg. Brooks then performed a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart. He had drawn level by the halfway mark and made a superior turn to take the lead. The Soviet freestyler pulled level at the 25m mark before Brooks again sprinted away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86s as he had vowed to his teammates. The time of 3m 45.70s sealed Australia's first-ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women. The team then made a celebratory dive into the pool and were interviewed at the poolside. Evans said that the relay [...] "was unbelievable, but it was all so logical. I was so deliriously happy that I couldn't stop talking." ...|$|E
2500|$|With Mirabeau's {{death the}} task of saving the monarchy became much more difficult, as the king was less {{reconciled}} <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> been with the Revolution, and thus revolutionary leaders became less willing to share power with a king who proved so unwilling to compromise.

He promised to consider the matter, although he did agree to create a reserve corps of 3 British divisions to serve anywhere on the Western Front. He recorded that Foch was “more anxious” <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen him, although Lord Derby, who was also present, recorded that Haig himself seemed “tired and anxious”.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the decade}} carried on, Hepburn {{appeared}} in {{an assortment of}} genres including the heist comedy How to Steal a Million (1966) where she played {{the daughter of a}} famous art collector, whose collection consists entirely of forgeries. Fearing her father's exposure, she sets out to steal one of his priceless statues {{with the help of a}} man played by Peter O'Toole. It was followed by two films in 1967. The first was Two for the Road, a non-linear and innovative British dramedy that traces the course of a couple's troubled marriage. Director Stanley Donen said that Hepburn was more free and happy <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen her, and he credited that to co-star Albert Finney. The second, Wait Until Dark, is a suspense thriller in which Hepburn demonstrated her acting range by playing the part of a terrorised blind woman. Filmed on the brink of her divorce, it was a difficult film for her, as husband Mel Ferrer was its producer. She lost fifteen pounds under the stress, but she found solace in co-star Richard Crenna and director Terence Young. Hepburn earned her fifth and final competitive Academy Award nomination for Best Actress; Bosley Crowther affirmed, [...] "Hepburn plays the poignant role, the quickness with which she changes and the skill with which she manifests terror attract sympathy and anxiety to her and give her genuine solidity in the final scenes." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Italians {{had shown}} {{an ability to}} {{co-ordinate}} columns separated by many miles of desert and the British forces had kept their discipline during the retreat and preserved most of their forces. Mussolini boasted that Italy had conquered a territory (British Somaliland, the Sudan area around the border outposts of Karora, Gallabat, Kurmak and Kassala and the area in Kenya around Moyale and Buna) the size of England in the Horn of Africa. News of the evacuation {{came as a shock}} to British public opinion but Wavell backed Godwen-Austen, saying that he had judged the situation correctly. British Somaliland was annexed to Italian East Africa. De Simone wrote that the Italians captured five guns, five mortars, more than a hundred trucks, three Bren gun carriers, 30 anti-tank guns, 71 machine-guns, many small-arms and much ammunition. Winston Churchill criticised Wavell for the loss of British Somaliland; because of the few casualties, Churchill thought that the colony had not been adequately defended and proposed a court of enquiry. Wavell refused to hold an inquiry, called it a textbook withdrawal in the face of superior numbers by Godwin-Austen and Wilson, sending a telegram to Churchill including the passage [...] "...a big butcher’s bill was not necessarily evidence of good tactics". Churchill was said by General John Dill to have been moved by the telegram to [...] "greater anger <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen him in before" [...] and that the incident {{was the beginning of the}} end for Wavell.|$|E
2500|$|Vine's cricket {{career was}} not one of a rapid rise to fame. Although he played his first {{first-class}} match in 1896, it was not until 1900, after some tentative appearances in the three previous seasons, that he earned a regular place in the Sussex eleven. After that, however, he was indispensable. He was essentially a county cricketer, nearly all his work having been done for Sussex, but if, in addition to his batting and fielding, he had managed to retain his skill as a leg-break bowler it is quite likely that he would have played for England before he played his two Test matches in 1911/2. Already a dependable player, he made a great advance as a batsman in 1904 and during 1905 he was better <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> been before, scoring for Sussex in county matches alone over sixteen hundred runs. Good as his position is he would probably have been thought still more of if he had belonged to another county. A batsman would need to be great indeed to play on the same side as Ranjitsinhji and C.B. Fry, and not be overshadowed. His success as a batsman was largely gained in a series of first-wicket partnerships with Fry, and though he may at times carry caution a little too far and keep an undue check on his hitting powers, the result is nearly always so satisfactory that it would be sheer hypercriticism to find fault with him. As an outfield Vine has not the wonderful pick-up of Denton, but in every other respect was in the highest class, {{and in the course of}} a season at the beginning of the twentieth century, perhaps no one saved a larger number of runs.|$|E
2500|$|After Dave Malloy first {{performed}} on the Ars Nova stage in 2010, Artistic Director Jason Eagan, was blown away by his originality, range, and rigor, {{which led to a}} curiosity of what else was swirling around his head. Malloy became Ar Nova's 2012 Composer in Residence, giving Malloy access to all of Ars Nova's resources for one year- time, space, money, writing retreats, and a commission to create a new music-driven work to be produced at Ars Nova. When Dave proposed a musical based on Tolstoy's War and Peace Jason knew it was beyond Ars Nova's typical resources, but the project was too good to pass up. Jason knew that Ars Nova could push Dave farther <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> been before, and Dave could push Ars Nova farther than they had been before. October 2011 commenced the first weeklong workshop used to further develop the characters, story, music, and explore the idea of mixing a concert party and theater into one event. As the workshop ended Jason knew that this production would take more resources than they typically put into each production, and would take Ars Nova's entire production budget, a budget usually reserved for two productions, to accomplish this lofty goal. [...] In April of 2012, the production went through its second workshop to explore how the piece would live on its feet in the space.At the conclusion of the second workshop designer, Mimi Lin was brought on and made the decision to elevate the performers on runways that would swirl around the audience, allowing the performers to move through the space in full view. August 27, 2012, marked the date for the first rehearsal at Ars Nova. It was a month of creatively fueled blood, sweat and tears by a tremendous group of artists giving their all. The show officially opened at Ars Nova on October 16, 2012, {{and by the end of}} that week, the entire run was sold out. The extension sold out within one hour.|$|E
