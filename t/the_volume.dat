5|$|The {{sound on}} a tonewheel Hammond organ is varied through the {{manipulation}} of drawbars. A drawbar is a metal slider that controls <b>the</b> <b>volume</b> of a particular sound component, {{in a similar way}} to a fader on an audio mixing board. As a drawbar is incrementally pulled out, it increases <b>the</b> <b>volume</b> of its sound. When pushed all the way in, <b>the</b> <b>volume</b> is decreased to zero.|$|E

5|$|About 50–80% of {{salicylate}} in {{the blood}} is bound to albumin protein, while the rest remains in the active, ionized state; protein binding is concentration-dependent.

Acidosis increases <b>the</b> <b>volume</b> of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates.|$|E
5|$|After {{the results}} of the first scrutiny, Cardinal Avila, Philip III of Spain's {{representative}} at the conclave, announced that Philip had vetoed Baronius.

The title keys are stored on the disc and themselves encrypted with another key called <b>the</b> <b>volume</b> unique key. <b>The</b> <b>volume</b> unique key for any disc can be calculated by all authorized devices using another key called a processing key, which is derived from a media key block stored on each disc.

5000|$|Boyle's Law {{is used to}} {{calculate}} <b>the</b> unknown <b>volume</b> within <b>the</b> lungs. First, <b>the</b> change in <b>volume</b> of <b>the</b> chest is computed.

40|$|Abstract. We {{calculate}} <b>the</b> <b>volumes</b> of <b>the</b> hyperbolic twist knot cone-manifolds using Schläfli formula.

We express the length of the singular locus in terms of the distance between the two axes fixed by two generators. In this way the calculation becomes simpler than using the singular locus directly. <b>The</b> <b>volumes</b> of <b>the</b> hyperbolic twist knot cone-manifolds simpler than Steve-dore’s knot are known.
