5|$|Capitalization {{during this}} time was not standardized. It {{depended}} on <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>and</b> their background. Those influenced by German capitalized all nouns, while others capitalized more sparsely. It is also not always apparent which letters are capitalized owing to the Gothic or blackletter typeface which was used to print the Bible. This typeface was in use until the mid-18th century, when it was gradually replaced with a Latin typeface (often antiqua).|$|E
5|$|Imaginos was envisioned {{as a rock}} opera to be {{published}} as a trilogy of double albums, with a storyline encompassing about two hundred years of history, {{from the beginning of}} the 19th century to the end of the 20th. This album represents an abbreviated version of the first volume of that planned trilogy, but with the songs arranged out of order, rendering the story harder to comprehend. Even when the song lyrics are analyzed in the chronological order that was devised by <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>and</b> is followed in this section, the narrative progression is scarce and the content often difficult to decipher for the casual reader. However, thanks to various comments in interviews by Pearlman and Bouchard, and the extensive sleeve notes by Pearlman that were issued with the original release, it is possible to reconstruct the story to a great extent.|$|E

25|$|Folk song traditions {{were taken}} to Australia by early {{settlers}} from England, Scotland and Ireland and gained particular foothold in the rural outback. The rhyming songs, poems and tales written {{in the form of}} bush ballads often relate to the itinerant and rebellious spirit of Australia in The Bush, and <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>and</b> performers are often referred to as bush bards. The 19th century was the golden age of bush ballads. Several collectors have catalogued the songs including John Meredith whose recording in the 1950s became the basis of the collection in the National Library of Australia.|$|E
25|$|As {{transportation}} improved, {{poverty in}} New York diminished, and street lighting made for safer travel at night, {{the number of}} potential patrons for {{the growing number of}} theatres increased enormously. Plays could run longer and still draw in the audiences, leading to better profits and improved production values. As in England, during {{the latter half of the}} century, the theatre began to be cleaned up, with less prostitution hindering the attendance of the theatre by women. Gilbert and Sullivan's family-friendly comic opera hits, beginning with H.M.S. Pinafore in 1878, were imported to New York (by <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>and</b> also in numerous unlicensed productions). They were imitated in New York by American productions such as Reginald Dekoven's Robin Hood (1891) and John Philip Sousa's El Capitan (1896), along with operas, ballets and other British and European hits.|$|E

500|$|In October 1999, {{after having}} been {{informed}} by Currie of the problems and seeing the specimen for the first time, Xu noticed that the tail of [...] "Archaeoraptor" [...] strongly resembled an unnamed maniraptoran dinosaur that he was studyinglater to be named Microraptor zhaoianus.

500|$|Architectural {{historian}} James F. O'Gorman compares Taliesin to Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, {{calling it}} [...] "not a mere building but an entire {{environment in which}} man, architecture and nature form a harmonious whole." [...] He continues that the building {{is an expression of}} Romanticism influence in architecture. William Barillas, in an assay of the Prairie School movement, agrees with O'Gorman's assessment and calls Taliesin [...] "the ultimate prairie house." [...] In Taliesin 1911–1914, a collection of essays about the first house, <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>and</b> editor conclude that Taliesin was [...] "Wright's architectural self portrait." [...] In a 2009 publication for the Thoreau Society, Naomi Uechi notes thematic similarities between the architecture of Taliesin and the concept of simplicity advocated by philosopher Henry David Thoreau. Neil Levine highlighted the abstract nature of the complex, comparing it to the works of Pablo Picasso.|$|E
