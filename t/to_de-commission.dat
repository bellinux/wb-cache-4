25|$|During mid-1991, Perth {{sailed to}} the Mediterranean via South-east Asia and eastern Africa. She {{returned}} to Sydney in August, then {{spent the rest}} of the year on training exercises and visits to New Zealand. Early 1990 saw her return to South-east Asia, then operate off the coast of Western Australia before a stint in the South China Sea, returning to Australia in November. The ship spent the early part of 1994 making port visits to western Australia, New Guinea, and New Zealand before docking for refit in June. This did not conclude until the end of March 1995, with the ship sailing to the South China Sea for multinational naval exercises later in the year. In 1996, Perth participated in RIMPAC, before visiting Melbourne for the Melbourne Cup. She returned to Hawaii for another RIMPAC exercise in 1998. 1999 was spent primarily on exercises, along with a deployment to South East Asia, including port visits to Vietnam (for the first time since the war), Guam, Manila, Hong Kong and Singapore. Perth completed a round-Australia voyage during July and August prior <b>to</b> <b>de-commissioning.</b>|$|R
50|$|For most of {{the twentieth}} century the Swedish Navy focused on the threat of a {{full-scale}} invasion of Sweden via the Baltic and on protecting commercial shipping. Sweden's location on the Scandinavian peninsula makes it highly dependent of maritime trade: 90% imports and exports enter or leave Sweden through the Baltic. In 1972 the government decreed that non-military measures should be used to protect merchant shipping. The resolution led <b>to</b> the <b>de-commissioning</b> of all the navy's destroyers and frigates, though the non-military measures the government intended to use to protect shipping have never been specified.|$|R
