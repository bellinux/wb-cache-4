One {{of the most effective}} ways to make blood transfusion a safer practice is hemovigilance, which provides important data, including the history of feared <b>transfusion</b> <b>reactions.</b> In recent years in Brazil, there has been an improvement in the reporting of <b>transfusion</b> <b>reactions,</b> however due to the great diversity of hematology services, there are still <b>transfusion</b> <b>reactions.</b> The aims of this study were described the main types of <b>transfusion</b> <b>reactions,</b> as well as to evaluate the underreporting importance of transfusion occurrences of hemotherapy services in Brazil...|$|R
25|$|In {{people with}} A-T who have {{low levels of}} IgA, further testing should be {{performed}} {{to determine whether the}} IgA level is low or completely absent. If absent, there is a slightly increased risk of a <b>transfusion</b> <b>reaction.</b> “Medical Alert” bracelets are not necessary, but the family and primary physician should be aware that if there is elective surgery requiring red cell transfusion, the cells should be washed to decrease the risk of an allergic reaction.|$|E
25|$|Transfusion-associated graft versus host disease {{frequently}} {{occurs in}} immunodeficient patients where recipient's body failed to eliminate donor's T cells. Instead, donor's T cells attack the recipient's cells. It occurs {{one week after}} transfusion. Fever, rash, diarrhoea are often associated {{with this type of}} <b>transfusion</b> <b>reaction.</b> Mortality rate is high, with 89.7% of the patients died after 24 days. Immunosuppressive treatment is the most common way of treatment. Irradiation and leukoreduction of blood products is necessary for high risk patients for prevent T cells from attacking recipient cells.|$|E
25|$|Platelets, either apheresis-derived or random-donor, can be {{processed}} through a volume reduction process. In this process, the platelets are spun in a centrifuge and the excess plasma is removed, leaving 10 to 100 mL of platelet concentrate. Such volume-reduced platelets are normally transfused only to neonatal and pediatric patients, {{when a large}} volume of plasma could overload the child's small circulatory system. The lower volume of plasma also reduces the chances of an adverse <b>transfusion</b> <b>reaction</b> to plasma proteins. Volume reduced platelets have a shelf life of only four hours.|$|E

25|$|Febrile nonhemolytic {{reactions}} {{are the most}} common type of blood <b>transfusion</b> <b>reaction</b> and occur due to the release of inflammatory chemical signals released by white blood cells in stored donor blood or attack on donor's white blood cells by recipient's antibodies. This type of reaction occurs in about 7% of transfusions. Fever is generally short lived and is treated with antipyretics, and transfusions may be finished as long as an acute hemolytic reaction is excluded. This is a reason for the now-widespread use of leukoreduction – the filtration of donor white cells from red cell product units.|$|E
25|$|Transfusion-associated acute lung injury (TRALI) is a {{syndrome}} that {{is similar}} to Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which develops within 6 hours during a plasma-product containing blood products transfusion. Fever, hypotension, shortness of breath, and tachycardia often occurs in this type of reaction. It occurs in 15% of the transfused patient with mortality rate of 5 to 10%. Recipient risk factors includes: end-stage liver disease, sepsis, haematological malignancies, sepsis, and ventilated patients. Human Neutrophil Antigen (HNA) has been associated with this type of <b>transfusion</b> <b>reaction.</b> Donor's antibodies would interact with recipient's neutrophils and monocytes, releasing inflammatory cytokines and causes pulmonary capillary leakage. The treatment is supportive.|$|E
25|$|A {{blood plasma}} {{transfusion}} from a donor dog {{that has already}} survived CPV is sometimes used to provide passive immunity to the sick dog. Some veterinarians keep these dogs on site, or have frozen serum available. There have been no controlled studies regarding this treatment. Additionally, fresh frozen plasma and human albumin transfusions can help replace the extreme protein losses seen in severe cases and help assure adequate tissue healing. However, this is controversial with the availability of safer colloids such as Hetastarch, as it will also increase the colloid osmotic pressure without the ill effect of predisposing that canine patient to future <b>transfusion</b> <b>reaction.</b>|$|E

25|$|Blood transfusions {{typically}} use {{sources of}} blood: one's own (autologous transfusion), or someone else's (allogeneic or homologous transfusion). The latter {{is much more}} common than the former. Using another's blood must first start with donation of blood. Blood is most commonly donated as whole blood intravenously and collecting it with an anticoagulant. In developed countries, donations are usually anonymous to the recipient, but products in a blood bank are always individually traceable through the whole cycle of donation, testing, separation into components, storage, and administration to the recipient. This enables management and investigation of any suspected transfusion related disease transmission or <b>transfusion</b> <b>reaction.</b> In developing countries the donor is sometimes specifically recruited by or for the recipient, typically a family member, and the donation occurs immediately before the transfusion.|$|E
2500|$|Delayed {{hemolytic}} reactions occur {{more than}} 24 hours until 14 {{days after a}} transfusion. This is due to low amount of antibodies available during {{the start of the}} transfusion. Therefore, acute haemolytic reaction does not manifests until after 24 hours when enough amount of antibodies are available to cause a reaction. The red blood cells are removed by macrophages from the blood circulation into liver and spleen to be destroyed, which leads to extravascular haemolysis. This process usually mediated by anti-Rh and anti-Kidd antibodies. However, this type of <b>transfusion</b> <b>reaction</b> is less severe when compared to acute haemolytic <b>transfusion</b> <b>reaction</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|In apheresis procedures, the {{red blood}} cells are returned. [...] If this is done {{manually}} and the donor receives the blood from a different donor, a <b>transfusion</b> <b>reaction</b> can take place.

40|$|The {{recognition}} {{and management of}} <b>transfusion</b> <b>reactions</b> (TRs) are critical to ensure patient safety during and after a blood <b>transfusion.</b> <b>Transfusion</b> <b>reactions</b> are classified into acute <b>transfusion</b> <b>reactions</b> (ATRs) or delayed <b>transfusion</b> <b>reactions,</b> and each category includes different subtypes. Different ATRs share common signs and symptoms which can make categorisation difficult {{at the beginning of}} the reaction. Moreover, TRs are often under-recognised and under-reported. To ensure uniform practice and safety, it is necessary to implement a national haemovigilance system and a set of national guidelines establishing policies for blood transfusion and for the detection and management of TRs. In Oman, there are currently no local TR guidelines to guide physicians and hospital blood banks. This paper summarises the available literature and provides consensus guidelines to be used in the recognition, management and reporting of ATRs...|$|R

These reactions are usually caused by anti-Fya or anti-Fyb. anti-Fy3 may cause acute or delayed hemolytic <b>transfusion</b> <b>reactions</b> (HTRs), but only rarely. Anti-Fy5 may also cause delayed hemolytic <b>transfusion</b> <b>reactions.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 1939 Philip Levine and Rufus E. Stetson {{published}} {{their findings}} {{about a family}} who had a stillborn baby who died of hemolytic disease of the newborn. [...] The mother was aged 25 {{and it was her}} second pregnancy and she suffered blood loss at the delivery. [...] Both parents were blood group O and the husband's blood was used to give the mother a blood transfusion, but the mother suffered a severe <b>transfusion</b> <b>reaction.</b> [...] They investigated this <b>transfusion</b> <b>reaction.</b> [...] Since the mother and the father were both blood group O, they concluded that there must be a previously undiscovered blood group antigen that was present on the husband's RBCs (red blood cells) but was not present on the mother's RBCs and that the mother had formed antibodies against the new blood group antigen. [...] This suggested {{for the first time that}} a mother could make blood group antibodies because of immune sensitization to her fetus's RBCs. [...] They did not name this blood group antigen, but it was subsequently found to be the rhesus factor.|$|E
2500|$|Patients should ideally {{receive their}} own blood or type-specific blood {{products}} {{to minimize the}} chance of a <b>transfusion</b> <b>reaction.</b> [...] Risks can be further reduced by cross-matching blood, but this may be skipped when blood is required for an emergency. Cross-matching involves mixing a sample of the recipient's serum with a sample of the donor's red blood cells and checking if the mixture agglutinates, or forms clumps. If agglutination is not obvious by direct vision, blood bank technicians usually check for agglutination with a microscope. If agglutination occurs, that particular donor's blood cannot be transfused to that particular recipient. [...] In a blood bank it is vital that all blood specimens are correctly identified, so labelling has been standardized using a barcode system known as ISBT 128.|$|E
2500|$|Acute {{hemolytic}} {{reactions are}} defined according to Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) as [...] "fever and other symptoms/signs of haemolysis within 24 hours of transfusion; confirmed {{by one or}} more of the following: a fall of Hb, rise in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT), positive crossmatch" [...] This is due to destruction of donor red blood cells by preformed recipient antibodies. Most often this occurs due to clerical errors or improper ABO blood typing and crossmatching resulting in a mismatch in ABO blood type between the donor and the recipient. Symptoms include fever, chills, chest pain, back pain, hemorrhage, increased heart rate, shortness of breath, and rapid drop in blood pressure. When suspected, transfusion should be stopped immediately, and blood sent for tests to evaluate for presence of hemolysis. Treatment is supportive. Kidney injury may occur due to the effects of the hemolytic reaction (pigment nephropathy). The severity of the <b>transfusion</b> <b>reaction</b> is depended upon amount of donor's antigen transfused, nature of the donor's antigens, the nature and the amount of recipient antibodies.|$|E

2500|$|An Rh D-negative {{patient who}} does not have any anti-D {{antibodies}} (never being previously sensitized to D-positive RBCs) can receive a transfusion of D-positive blood once, but this would cause sensitization to the D antigen, and a female patient would become at risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn. [...] If a D-negative patient has developed anti-D antibodies, a subsequent exposure to D-positive blood would lead to a potentially dangerous <b>transfusion</b> <b>reaction.</b> Rh D-positive blood should never be given to D-negative women of child bearing age or to patients with D antibodies, so blood banks must conserve Rh-negative blood for these patients. In extreme circumstances, such as for a major bleed when stocks of D-negative blood units are very low at the blood bank, D-positive blood might be given to D-negative females above child-bearing age or to Rh-negative males, providing {{that they did not have}} anti-D antibodies, to conserve D-negative blood stock in the blood bank. The converse is not true; Rh D-positive patients do not react to D negative blood.|$|E
2500|$|Disincentives: The Tax Relief & Health Care Act of 2006 {{required}} the HHS Inspector General to study ways that Medicare payments to hospitals could be recouped for [...] "never events", {{as defined by}} the National Quality Forum, including hospital infections. In August 2007, CMS announced that it will stop payments to hospitals for several negative consequences of care that result in injury, illness or death. This rule, effective October 2008, would reduce hospital payments for eight serious types of preventable incidents: objects left in a patient during surgery, blood <b>transfusion</b> <b>reaction,</b> air embolism, falls, mediastinitis, urinary tract infections from catheters, pressure ulcer, and sepsis from catheters. Reporting of [...] "never events" [...] and creation of performance benchmarks for hospitals are also mandated. Other private health payers are considering similar actions; in 2005, HealthPartners, a Minnesota health insurer, chose not to cover 27 types of [...] "never events". [...] The Leapfrog Group has announced that they will work with hospitals, health plans and consumer groups to advocate reducing payment for [...] "never events", and will recognize hospitals that agree to certain steps when a serious avoidable adverse event occurs in the facility, including notifying the patient and patient safety organizations, and waiving costs. Physician groups involved in the management of complications, such as the Infectious Diseases Society of America, have voiced objections to these proposals, observing that [...] "some patients develop infections despite application of all evidence-based practices known to avoid infection", and that a punitive response may discourage further study and slow the dramatic improvements that have already been made.|$|E
