5|$|The Sociedad de Beneficencia (Society of Beneficence), {{a charity}} group {{made up of}} 87 society ladies, was {{responsible}} for most charity works in Buenos Aires prior to the election of Juan Perón. Fraser and Navarro write {{that at one point}} the Sociedad had been an enlightened institution, caring for orphans and homeless women, but that those days had long since passed {{by the time of the}} first term of Juan Perón. In the 1800s, the Sociedad had been supported by private contributions, largely those of <b>the</b> <b>husbands</b> of the society ladies.

5|$|During the Chou Dynasty, {{the upper}} class {{considered}} daughters-in-law as commodities of the husband's parents, not <b>the</b> <b>husbands.</b> This meant that wives had to be subservient to parents-in-law. They were expected to have impeccable manners, including refraining from coughing and sneezing {{in the presence of}} their husbands' parents. Wives could not leave their rooms or accept gifts from relatives without permission. Refusal to turn gifts over to parents-in-law lead to physical abuse and expulsion from the family. In addition, wives were required to serve in-laws, including helping them bathe, arranging their bedding, and cooking. People placed a strong emphasis on food preparation in Ancient China. Cooking {{was one of the most}} time-consuming tasks for wives because of traditional rituals and high expectations for the taste and appeal of food.|$|E
5|$|The Fringe {{division}} tracks down {{a series}} of deaths of wives shortly after the passing of their respective husbands. Discovering traces of the husbands' DNA on {{the bodies of the}} wives, Walter Bishop (John Noble) suspects that the killer is using pheromones taken from <b>the</b> <b>husbands</b> to get close to the wives, using the substances as a perfume. Further identifying castoreum within the pheromone mix, they identify the murderer as Anson Carr (Michael Massee), a former and disgruntled employee of a perfume company inflicted with a rare skin disease. They arrive at Carr's home to find another husband, already dead, in a dehydration chamber, and race to protect his wife, Dianna (Ona Grauer). When no attack comes at the wife, Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) realizes that her husband may have been having an affair, and races to the mistress' home, stopping Carr before he can kill her. As he is taken away, he admits he was trying to discover what love was, scientifically, so that he could reproduce it and allow the entire world to share in it.|$|E

He promises to do whatever he can to secure his brother's release. The Master exits. Left alone, <b>the</b> <b>Husband</b> plunges into a deep despondency over his moral decline. He laments his wretched state in a soliloquy that begins with the line [...] "Oh thou confused man, thy pleasant sins have undone thee, thy damnation has beggared thee!" [...] (Commentators who allow a possibility of a Shakespearean contribution to the play tend to center their attention on this fourth scene and this soliloquy). <b>The</b> <b>Husband's</b> eldest son enters and tells his father to move so he can play with his toys.

5|$|Despite {{advances}} in relative social freedoms and legal rights, women were still {{expected to attend}} to the duties of the home. Along with child-rearing, women were responsible for spinning yarn, weaving cloth, sewing clothing, and cooking meals. Women who belonged to families that sold silk were especially busy, since their duties included coddling the silkworms, feeding them chopped mulberry tree leaves, and keeping them warm to ensure that they would eventually spin their cocoons. In the family pecking order, the dominant female of the household was the mother-in-law, who was free to hand out orders and privileges to the wives of her sons. Mothers often had strong ties with their grown and married sons, since these men often stayed at home. If a mother-in-law could not find sufficient domestic help from the daughters-in-law, there was a market for women to be bought as maids or servants. There were also many professional courtesans (and concubines brought into the house) who kept men busy in the pursuits of entertainment, relations, and romantic affairs. It was also common for wives to be jealous and conniving towards concubines that their wealthy husbands brought home. Yet two could play at this game. Most concubines were found in the families of feudal lords and kings. The ideal of the chaste, modest, and pious young woman was somewhat distorted in urban settings such as Hangzhou and Suzhou, where there were greedy and flirtatious women, as one author put it. This author stated that <b>the</b> <b>husbands</b> of these women could not satisfy them, and so took on as many as five 'complementary husbands'; if they lived close to a monastery, even Buddhist monks could suffice for additional lovers.|$|E

5000|$|Most Islamic {{schools of}} law agree that <b>the</b> <b>husband</b> is not {{entitled}} to more than the initial amount of dower (mahr) given to the wife. However, some interpretations suggest that <b>the</b> <b>husband</b> is entitled a greater compensation, while other interpretations suggest that <b>the</b> <b>husband</b> is {{not entitled to}} any compensation. [...] Technically, khulʿ demands that the mahr already paid be returned along with any wedding gifts. Many imams interpret this law only to apply {{if there is no}} fault on <b>the</b> <b>husband.</b> Men sometimes prefer and pressure their wives to demand a khulʿ instead of <b>the</b> <b>husband</b> pronouncing a talaq so that <b>the</b> <b>husband</b> can demand <b>the</b> return of the mahr. Another scenario that rarely arises in khulʿ is that <b>the</b> <b>husband</b> will request an unreasonable financial compensation. This can effectively constrain her from seeking khulʿ because they have no means to support themselves financially with the loss of their mahr and other wedding “gifts.” ...|$|R

The rape becomes passionate love-making, and <b>the</b> <b>Husband</b> attempts to block it out of his mind by recalling that the marquee of the movie house screening Rashomon was missing the [...] "a" [...] in the title. The Wife orders the Thief to bind <b>the</b> <b>husband.</b> She assaults her husband verbally, relishing her new-found power, and telling him everything she has kept bottled up during their marriage; she will take [...] "No More".

25|$|Women {{participating}} in polygynous marriages share common marital problems {{with women in}} a monogamous marriage; however, there are issues uniquely related to polygyny which affects their overall life satisfaction and have severe implications for women's health. Women practicing polygyny are susceptible to sexually transmitted diseases, infertility, and mental health complications. Among the Logoli of Kenya, the fear of AIDS or becoming infected with the HIV virus has informed women's decisions about entering polygynous marriages. Some view polygyny {{as a means to}} prevent men from taking random sexual partners and potentially introducing STDs into relationships. Interviews conducted with some of the Logoli tribe in Kenya suggested they feared polygynous marriages because of what they have witnessed in the lives of other women who are currently in such relationships. The observed experiences of some of the women in polygynous unions tend to be characterized by frequent jealousy, conflicts, competition, tensions, and psychological stresses. Some of <b>the</b> <b>husbands</b> fail to share love and other resources equally; and envy and hatred, and sometimes violent physical confrontations become {{the order of the day}} among co-wives and their children. This discourages women from entering a polygynous marriage. Research shows that competition and conflict can intensify to unbearable level for co- wives causing women to commit suicide due to psychological distress. Findings show that the wife order can affect life satisfaction. According to Bove and Valeggia, women who are senior wives often misuse their position to obtain healthcare benefits in countries one wife can become a recipient. The conflict between co-wives can attribute to the higher rates of mental health disorders such as anxiety, depression, and paranoia.|$|E

He included Keemat Lal (who plays {{a police officer in}} all Bond's stories), although the character is not in the original story.
