Admitting that he killed Sam's girlfriend Jessica because he believed she was holding him back from returning to his old life of hunting supernatural creatures, the demon then shows him the night of his mother's death. Azazel had come into Sam's nursery and fed him his blood, with Mary Winchester (Samantha Smith) walking in and recognizing the demon.|$|E
5|$|When the lex Hortensia {{was enacted}} into law, Rome {{theoretically}} became a democracy (insofar as the landowners were concerned, anyway). In reality, however, Rome remained an oligarchy, since the critical laws were still {{enacted by the}} Roman Senate. In effect, democracy was satisfied with the possession of power, but did not care to actually use it. The senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by foreign policy. While upwards of 300,000 citizens were eligible to vote, many of these individuals lived a great distance from Rome, and so calling <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>together</b> {{in a short period}} of time was impossible. The foreign affairs questions often required quick answers, and three-hundred senators were more capable of quick action than were thousands of electors. The questions were also more complex than were the questions of the earlier era, and the average citizen was not adequately informed as to these issues. The senators, in contrast, were usually quite experienced, and the fact that they had income sources that were independent of their political roles made it easier for them to involve themselves in policy questions over extended periods of time.|$|E

The comic was published in hard copy as four issues on March 7, March 21, April 4, and April 18, 2012, respectively. The comic retells the events of The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger from the point-of-view of S.H.I.E.L.D., with extra scenes added to weave <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>together.</b>|$|E
25|$|After the battle, Ostorius was honoured with triumphal {{insignia}} but {{the victory}} did not entirely quell {{resistance in the}} Welsh borders. The Silures especially continued to harass Roman troops, supposedly after Ostorius had publicly said that they posed such a danger {{that they should be}} either exterminated or transplanted. A large legionary force occupied in building forts in Siluran territory was surrounded and attacked and only rescued with difficulty and considerable loss. This violent desperation {{on the part of the}} Silures can be attributed to their reaction to what Peter Salway calls Ostorius' lack of political judgement. The Silures had been galvanised by Ostorius' ill-thought out threats to destroy them and began taking Roman prisoners as hostages and distributing them amongst their neighbouring tribes. This had the effect of binding <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>together</b> and creating a new resistance movement.|$|E

25|$|After {{they were}} sent into exile in 625 from Medina by Muslim forces, the Banu Nadir had settled in Khaybar. In 627, the Nadir chief Huyayy ibn Akhtab {{together}} with his son joined the Meccans and Bedouins besieging Medina during the Battle of the Trench. In addition, the Nadir paid Arabian tribes {{to go to war}} against the Muslims. Bribing Banu Ghatafan with half of their harvest, Banu Nadir secured 2,000 men and 300 horsemen from the tribe to attack Muhammad, and similarly persuaded the Bani Asad. They attempted to get the Banu Sulaym attack the Muslims, but the tribe gave them only 700 men, since some of its leaders were sympathetic towards Islam. The Bani Amir refused to join <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>together,</b> as they had a pact with Muhammad. Once the battle started, Huyayy ibn Akhtab persuaded the Banu Qurayza to go against their covenant with Muhammad and turn against him during the battle. After the defeat of the confederates in the battle, and Qurayza's subsequent surrender, Huyayy (who was at that time in the Qurayza strongholds of Medina) was killed alongside the men of the Qurayza. After Huyayy's death, Abu al-Rafi ibn Abi al-Huqayq took charge of the Banu Nadir at Khaybar. Al-Huqayq soon approached neighboring tribes to raise an army against Muhammad. After learning this, the Muslims, aided by an Arab with a Jewish dialect, assassinated him.|$|E

He stated: [...] "I was really lucky because there's a real phonetic coherence of the episode that brought <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>together</b> on an emotional level.

[...] Bordwell argues that the film did not invent any of its famous techniques such as deep focus cinematography, shots of the ceilings, chiaroscuro lighting and temporal jump-cuts, {{and many of these}} stylistics had been used in German Expressionist films of the 1920s, such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. But Bordwell asserts that the film did put <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>together</b> {{for the first time and}} perfected the medium in one single film. In a 1948 interview D. W.

500|$|... "Time Capsule" [...] {{continued}} what Michael Schur {{described as}} one of the primary story arcs of the third season: Ben Wyatt gradually falling in love not only with Leslie Knope, but with the town of Pawnee itself. This is particularly illustrated by how impressed Ben is with the Pawnee citizens who make impassioned cases for what they want inside the Pawnee time capsule: although he still considers them weirdos, he respectfully calls them [...] "weirdos who care". During the cold open, while discussing the time capsule, Leslie describes several former Pawnee town slogans. After each slogan, the camera switches to a different cut of Leslie reading another. This method of comedic narrative is frequently used in Parks and Recreation, in which Poehler and the other actors improvise several different jokes and the editors slice <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>together</b> into one scene.|$|E
500|$|Although Beck {{had been}} {{impressed}} with the Chess studio's history and sound, he {{had been unable to}} complete a guitar solo to his satisfaction. [...] "I kept changing guitar sounds all the way through. So we did two or three takes of my guitars and blended <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>together.</b> But the solo on [...] "Shapes of Things" [...] was pretty honest up until that feedback note that comes in over it", he recalled. [...] During the recording, [...] "there was mass hysteria in the studio when I did that solo. [...] They weren't expecting it and it was just some weird mist coming from the East out of an amp. [...] Giorgio was freaking out and dancing about like some tribal witch doctor". [...] Beck played the solo on one string(G), using a 1954 Fender Esquire guitar he had purchased before the tour. Relf also benefitted from multi-tracking—two vocal tracks were recorded, allowing him to harmonise the vocal line.|$|E
500|$|Helen Baxendale {{was nearing}} the end of her pregnancy, so could not join the rest of the cast abroad, thus all of her scenes were filmed in Manchester and Salford. The scenes in Rachel and Adam's hotel room were shot at the Lowry Hotel in Salford and {{exterior}} scenes of the hotel were filmed at the GMEX Centre. The taxi that takes Rachel and Adam to the hospital was a Holden car imported to Britain from Australia and altered to look like a taxi. The Loaf bar at Deansgate Locks provided a filming location for some scenes. The final scene of the episode was filmed on an aeroplane set constructed in a studio. Robert Bathurst said, [...] "We shot the scene in the studio because we weren't allowed to film on a real aircraft. So we had to get sections of a plane's interior and stick <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>together.</b> The bits were flapping all over the place whenever anyone moved.

500|$|Another VFX {{supervisor}} from Zoic Studios, Andrew Orloff, {{believed the}} episode's special effects were {{possibly the most}} difficult of the season. He wrote, [...] "Originally, {{it was supposed to be}} a practical effect but they couldn't get it to fall in a natural way, so what we had to do was shoot the practical elements in pieces and we put <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>together</b> and timed all those plates and ended up rebuilding a significant part of it and tying it all together in CG. So we took a cyberscan of the guy's body, and on top of all the practical elements we used as a base, we had a matte painting, a reveal matte painting of the cracks that ran through the body, 3D particles of large chunks of ash falling out, 3D particles of small ash bits floating down, residual dust flying off of it and, at one point, his head falls off and crashes to the ground as ash. So we had to do a full-CG head and tumble it down the body. That was pretty complicated and entailed lots of R there was 2D work in After Effects, tracking, retiming, we did a lot of CG lighting for the body parts in Maya/mental ray and all of the particles were a combination of Maya software, and rendered in Maya/mental ray." ...|$|E
500|$|Mileena is {{commonly}} perceived {{as one of}} the best characters of Mortal Kombat II in gameplay terms. She was ranked as the game's best overall fighter by Sega Visions for her high speed and reach as well as her teleport kick that can uniquely dodge the opponent's projectiles.

[...] EGM noted about how this [...] "deadly woman...can hold her own against any man in the game" [...] as her players can use her [...] "lightning speed" [...] and the sai blasts to overcome other players, while C+VG evaluated all of Mortal Kombat II characters as [...] "well-balanced" [...] and [...] "potentially excellent", but still the teleport kick of the [...] "very fast" [...] Mileena was singled out by them as [...] "the best surprising move in the game."

500|$|Jason Lipshutz from Billboard {{described}} it as a [...] "motorcycle mayhem meets biblical betrayal." [...] MTV News' James Montogomery called the video as a pure pop clip, [...] "albeit one that looks great and is sure to earn the ire of a few folks on the religious right." [...] He added that [...] "Judas" [...] is, at its sacred heart, an artistic explosion contained within the confines of a traditional pop clip. Christian Blauvelt from Entertainment Weekly did not like the video at first, calling it her weakest effort to date and attributing it to Gibson's choreography and the literal storyline. However, he admitted that after watching the video a few times, he became fond of it. Tris McCall from The Star-Ledger felt that there was neither anything blasphemous about the video, nor anything too daring about it. McCall explained that the dancing in the video is a [...] "pleasure to watch", but would have been better if the camera work was more professional. According to him, the only eye-catching prop in the video was the gun that turned into a lipstick. Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone was certain that the video would offend some Christians for its irreverent and highly sexualized take on Jesus Christ; he also said that Gaga interpreted the Biblical story in her own style. Oscar Moralde from Slant Magazine complimented the production of the video by calling it [...] "visually stunning", while adding that [...] "'Judas' is the work of a repertory, not a revolutionary. It takes familiar swatches from Gaga's palette (the leather-and-chain aesthetic of [...] "Telephone"; the plaintive, tear-stained camera stare of [...] "Bad Romance") and puts <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>together</b> for a competently executed work." [...] Phil Fox Rose, while reviewing the video for The Washington Post, gave it a positive review stating that he found it [...] "moving, both artistically and spiritually." [...] He then went on to explain how the religion related accusations against Gaga were completely biased. VH1 found that the video was inspired by Madonna's [...] "Like a Prayer", the films Our Lady of the Assassins, The Wild Angels and Romeo + Juliet, and the American television series Lost. NME named 'Judas' the fourth worst music video ever, describing it as [...] "an attempt to jump on the Madonna/Catholicism bandwagon that so incredibly misjudged it's quite comical." ...|$|E
