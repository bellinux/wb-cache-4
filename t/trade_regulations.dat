5|$|Globalization at {{this time}} was {{hindered}} by war, diseases and population growth in certain areas. The Corn Laws were established to regulate imports and exports of grains in England, thus restricting trade {{and the expansion of}} globalization. The Corn Crop Laws hindered the market economy and globalization based on tariffs and import restrictions. Eventually, the Ricardian theory of economics became prominent and allowed for improved <b>trade</b> <b>regulations,</b> specifically with Portugal.|$|E
5|$|British {{officials}} filed two lawsuits {{stemming from}} the Liberty incident: an in rem suit against the ship, and an in personam suit against Hancock. Royal officials, as well as Hancock's accuser, stood to gain financially, since, as was the custom, any penalties assessed by the court would be awarded to the governor, the informer, and the Crown, each getting a third. The first suit, filed on June 22, 1768, resulted in the confiscation of the Liberty in August. Customs officials then used the ship to enforce <b>trade</b> <b>regulations</b> until it was burned by angry colonists in Rhode Island the following year.|$|E
5|$|By far {{the largest}} single cost was the {{purchase}} of the ship Terra Nova, for £12,500. Terra Nova had been in Antarctica before, as part of the second Discovery relief operation. Scott wanted to sail her as a Naval vessel under the White Ensign; to enable this, he obtained membership of the Royal Yacht Squadron for the sum of £100. He was thus able to impose Naval discipline on the expedition, and as a registered yacht of the Squadron, Terra Nova became exempt from Board of <b>Trade</b> <b>regulations</b> which might otherwise have deemed her unfit to sail.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Trade</b> <b>regulation</b> is a {{field of}} law, often {{bracketed}} with antitrust (as in the phrase “antitrust and <b>trade</b> <b>regulation</b> law”), including government regulation of unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive business acts or practices. Antitrust law is often considered a subset of <b>trade</b> <b>regulation</b> law. Franchise and distribution law, consumer protection law, and advertising law are sometimes considered parts of <b>trade</b> <b>regulation</b> law.|$|R

5|$|The commissioners of the Customs Board {{found that}} {{they were unable to}} enforce <b>trade</b> <b>regulations</b> in Boston, so they {{requested}} military assistance. Help {{came in the form of}} the HMS Romney, a fifty-gun warship which arrived in Boston Harbor in May 1768. Tensions escalated after the captain of the Romney began to impress local sailors. The situation exploded on June 10, when customs officials seized the Liberty, a sloop owned by John Hancock—a leading critic of the Customs Board—for alleged customs violations. Sailors and marines came ashore from the Romney to tow away the Liberty, and a riot broke out. Things calmed down in the following days, but fearful customs officials packed up their families and fled for protection to the Romney and eventually to Castle William, an island fort in the harbor.|$|E
25|$|In June 1772, American patriots, {{including}} John Brown, burned a British warship {{that had}} been vigorously enforcing unpopular <b>trade</b> <b>regulations</b> in {{what became known as}} the Gaspee Affair. The affair was investigated for possible treason, but no action was taken.|$|E

25|$|The central {{government}} funds were deemed insufficient by the Hainan authorities {{for the construction}} of the island's other infrastructures (water works, power stations, telecommunications, etc.) and had taken a very liberal interpretation of the economic and <b>trade</b> <b>regulations</b> for Hainan and thirteen coastal cities; the regulations did not mention on prohibiting the re-selling of second-hand goods. Some of the proceeds, from unsold units, were later retrieved by the {{central government}} to re-finance the special district.|$|E
25|$|Cuba {{failed to}} prosper before the 1760s, due to Spanish <b>trade</b> <b>regulations.</b> Spain {{had set up}} a trade {{monopoly}} in the Caribbean, and their primary objective was to protect this, which they did by barring the islands from trading with any foreign ships. The resultant stagnation of economic growth was particularly pronounced in Cuba because of its great strategic importance in the Caribbean, and the stranglehold that Spain kept on it as a result.|$|E
25|$|Pre-compliance & trading : The {{other main}} {{category}} of buyers on the voluntary markets are those engaged in pre-compliance and/or trading. Those purchasing offsets for pre-compliance purposes {{are doing so}} with the expectation, or as a hedge against the possibility, of future mandatory cap and <b>trade</b> <b>regulations.</b> As a mandatory cap would sharply increase the price of offsets, firms—especially those with large carbon footprints and the corresponding financial exposure to regulation—make the decision to acquire offsets in advance at what {{are expected to be}} lower prices.|$|E
40|$|This article revisits a past {{article by}} the authors in which they propose a new {{methodology}} for analyzing trade issues, cross-cutting through the three ―layers‖ of international trade regulation: so-called multisystem of <b>trade</b> <b>regulation.</b> In this text the authors include another approach to international <b>trade</b> <b>regulation</b> studies, proposing {{a better understanding of}} the influence of transnational enterprises in the shaping of modern internal trade. In this sense, the transnationals are not only influencing international <b>trade</b> <b>regulation</b> through lobbying in traditional fora (especially in plurilateral and preferential trade agreements), but they are also becoming sources of their own private regulations, particularly regarding private standards. In this sense, the study of international <b>trade</b> <b>regulation</b> must take into account the activities and interests of these indispensible actors, critically analyzing the differences between the regulatory logic of states against the one keen to transnational...|$|R

25|$|Following the {{restoration}} of Charles II to the throne in 1660, government practices in the colonies came under more scrutiny. Parliament passed the Navigation Acts to regulate trade {{for the benefit of}} the mother country. Massachusetts, with a thriving merchant fleet, often ran afoul of the <b>trade</b> <b>regulations.</b> Its government was reluctant to enforce them. Combined with intolerant religious practices, and the refusal to allow the Church of England to operate in the colony, led Charles II to formally vacate the Massachusetts charter in 1684.|$|E
25|$|Transparency. The WTO {{members are}} {{required}} to publish their <b>trade</b> <b>regulations,</b> to maintain institutions allowing for the review of administrative decisions affecting trade, to respond to requests for information by other members, and to notify changes in trade policies to the WTO. These internal transparency requirements are supplemented and facilitated by periodic country-specific reports (trade policy reviews) through the Trade Policy Review Mechanism (TPRM). The WTO system tries also to improve predictability and stability, discouraging the use of quotas and other measures used to set limits on quantities of imports.|$|E
25|$|In 1767, the Parliament {{passed the}} Townshend Acts which placed duties {{on a number}} of {{essential}} goods, including paper, glass, and tea, and established a Board of Customs in Boston to more rigorously execute <b>trade</b> <b>regulations.</b> The new taxes were enacted on the belief that Americans only objected to internal taxes and not to external taxes such as custom duties. The Americans, however, argued against the constitutionality of the act because its purpose was to raise revenue and not regulate trade. Colonists responded by organizing new boycotts of British goods. These boycotts were less effective, however, as the Townshend goods were widely used.|$|E

25|$|The <b>trade</b> <b>regulations</b> {{offered by}} the Regulament were welcomed with enthusiasm by Asachi, {{prompting}} him to write an ode in their honor, titled Annul nou al moldo-românilor 1830, în care s-a lucrat Regulamentul organic, acel întâi cod administrativ al Moldovei ("The New Year of the Moldo-Romanians 1830, in Which Regulamentul Organic, the First Administrative Code of Moldavia, Was Completed"). In sharp contrast to his later advocacies, Asachi attempted to introduce provisions for the two Principalities' union, {{and some of his}} interventions in the text were meant to facilitate this project. At the time, he took a compassionate view in respect to peasants, denouncing the exploitation of their labor by the boyars.|$|E
25|$|The colonists {{responded by}} {{establishing}} the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, effectively removing Crown {{control of the}} colony outside Boston. Meanwhile, representatives from twelve colonies convened the First Continental Congress {{to respond to the}} crisis. The Congress narrowly rejected a proposal which would have created an American parliament to act in concert with the British Parliament; instead, they passed a compact declaring a trade boycott against Britain. Congress also affirmed that Parliament had no authority over internal American matters, but they were willing to consent to <b>trade</b> <b>regulations</b> {{for the benefit of the}} empire, and they authorized committees and conventions to enforce the boycott. The boycott was effective, as imports from Britain dropped by 97% in 1775 compared to 1774.|$|E
25|$|Issues {{surrounding}} global <b>trade</b> <b>regulations</b> and LDCs {{have gained}} {{a lot of}} media and policy attention thanks to the recently collapsed Doha Round of World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations being termed a development round. During the WTO's Hong Kong Ministerial, it was agreed that LDCs could see 100 percent duty-free, quota-free access to U.S. markets if the round were completed. But analysis of the deal by NGOs found that the text of the proposed LDC deal had substantial loopholes that might make the offer less than the full 100 percent access, and could even erase some current duty-free access of LDCs to rich country markets. Dissatisfaction with these loopholes led some economists to call for a reworking of the Hong Kong deal.|$|E

25|$|Another {{measure to}} enforce the trade laws was the Vice Admiralty Court Act of 1768. Although often {{included}} in discussions of the Townshend Acts, this act was initiated by the Cabinet when Townshend was not present, and was not passed until after his death. Before this act, {{there was just one}} vice admiralty court in North America, located in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Established in 1764, this court proved to be too remote to serve all of the colonies, and so the 1768 Vice Admiralty Court Act created four district courts, which were located at Halifax, Boston, Philadelphia, and Charleston. One purpose of the vice admiralty courts, which did not have juries, was to help customs officials prosecute smugglers, since colonial juries were reluctant to convict persons for violating unpopular <b>trade</b> <b>regulations.</b>|$|E
25|$|In France, the National Assembly made {{radical changes}} in French laws, and on 26 August 1789, {{published}} the Declaration of the Rights of Man, declaring all men free and equal. The French Revolution shaped {{the course of}} the conflict in Saint-Domingue and was at first widely welcomed in the island. Wealthy whites saw it as an opportunity to gain independence from France, which would allow elite plantation-owners {{to take control of the}} island and create <b>trade</b> <b>regulations</b> that would further their own wealth and power. There were so many twists and turns in the leadership in France, and there were so many complex events in Saint-Domingue, that various classes and parties changed their alignments many times. However, the Haitian Revolution quickly became a test of the ideology of the French Revolution, as it radicalized the slavery question and forced French leaders to recognize the full meaning of their revolution.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{globalization}} {{is the increasing}} economic interdependence of national economies across the world through a rapid increase in cross-border movement of goods, services, technology, and capital. Whereas the globalization of business is centered around the diminution of international <b>trade</b> <b>regulations</b> as well as tariffs, taxes, and other impediments that suppresses global trade, economic {{globalization is}} the process of increasing economic integration between countries, leading to the emergence of a global marketplace or a single world market. Depending on the paradigm, economic globalization can be viewed as either a positive or a negative phenomenon. Economic globalization comprises: Globalization of production; which refers to the obtention of goods and services from a particular source from different locations around the globe to benefit from difference in cost and quality.Likewise, it also comprises of globalization of markets; which is defined as the union of different and separate markets into a massive global marketplace.Economic globalization also includes competition, technology, and corporations and industries.|$|E
