25|$|Tabnabbing takes {{advantage}} of <b>tabbed</b> <b>browsing,</b> with multiple open tabs. This method silently redirects the user to the affected site. This technique operates in reverse to most phishing techniques in that it doesn't directly take the user to the fraudulent site, but instead loads the fake page {{in one of the}} browser's open tabs.|$|E
25|$|The browser {{also has}} limited <b>tabbed</b> <b>browsing,</b> {{with a maximum}} of three tabs. When a website tries to open a link in a new window, the browser opens it in a new tab. The PSP browser is slower {{compared}} to modern browsers and often runs out of memory due to limitations put in place by Sony.|$|E
25|$|The user {{interface}} is completely redesigned and optimized for small screens, the controls are hidden away {{so that only}} the web content is shown on screen, and it uses touchscreen interaction methods.

25|$|Version 7 is {{intended}} to defend users from phishing as well as deceptive or malicious software, and it also features full user control of ActiveX and better security framework, including not being integrated as much with Windows as previous versions, thereby increasing security. Unlike previous versions, the Internet Explorer ActiveX control is not hosted in the Windows Explorer process, but rather it runs in its own process. It also includes bug fixes, enhancements to its support for web standards, <b>tabbed</b> <b>browsing</b> with tab preview and management, a multiple-engine search box, a web feeds reader, Internationalized Domain Name support (IDN), and antiphishing filter. On October 5, 2007, Microsoft removed the 'genuine software' validation before install, which means that all versions of Windows, whether able to pass validation or not, are able to install the browser. The integrated search box supports OpenSearch.|$|E
2500|$|Opera {{includes}} built-in <b>tabbed</b> <b>browsing,</b> a bookmarks bar, add-ons, and a download manager.

40|$|Parallel {{browsing}} {{describes a}} behavior where users visit Web pages in multiple concurrent threads. Web browsers explicitly support this by providing <b>tabs.</b> Although parallel <b>browsing</b> is more prevalent than linear browsing online, {{little is known}} about how users perform this activity. We study the use of parallel browsing through a log-based study of millions of Web users and present findings on their behavior. We identify a power law distribution in browser metrics comprising “outclicks ” and tab switches, which signify the degree of parallel browsing. We find that users switch tabs at least 57. 4 % of the time, but user activity, measured in pageviews, is split among tabs rather than increasing overall activity. Finally, analysis of a subset of the logs focused on Web search shows that while the majority of users do not branch from search engine result pages, the degree of branching is higher for non-navigational queries. Our findings have design implications for Web sites and browsers, search interfaces, and log analysis...|$|R

5000|$|DataLounge was {{launched}} by Mediapolis, Inc. in May, 1995. During the site's early years, content included gay-oriented news, gossip, {{links to other}} sites/services, and editorial content that made it a gay Web portal. Content contributors included New York drag queen Trudy and journalist Chris Barillas. DataLounge affiliated itself via the DataLounge Network with other web sites such as the gay dating site Edwina.com, gay Web guide Homorama, and gay health information site Gay Health, offering information and services to gays and lesbians. A weekly e-mail was also offered to users. The site evolved to have several discussion forums covering topics such as lesbian, religious and sexual issues, and also created a [...] "Flames and Freaks" [...] forum to house threads that site administrators determined to be disruptive to general forum discussion. Forums created for subpopulations such as The Lord of the Rings fans and U.S. daytime drama aficionados were subsequently closed. The most popular forum was the Gossip Forum, which dwarfed all others in both traffic and number of discussion threads created. A portion of DataLounge and the DataLounge Network's content came {{as a result of}} the integration of some of the 1995-97 content of Out.com from Out Magazine, which announced in March 1997 that it was closing its Web site to focus on print content. Out.com users were redirected to DataLounge, and DataLounge administrators adopted Out.com's discussion forums, dating service, and weekly survey. In 2003, DataLounge instituted a subscription service which blocked all web banner and pop-up advertising for a $12 annual fee (this fee was subsequently raised to $15, then to the present price of $18). In 2005, DataLounge was given a major redesign. All forum topics were collapsed into one general discussion forum called [...] "The DataLounge Forum," [...] and all news content, most references to the other sites in the DataLounge Network, and other features were discontinued. Editorial commentary discussing events continues to appear on the site. Users were also given the option to control aspects of the site's layout, including filtration of political, gossip, and/or [...] "Flames and Freaks" [...] threads. With this redesign came a policy change that limited access to the DataLounge Forum during high-traffic [...] "primetime" [...] periods to fee-paying subscribers. This move was met with controversy amongst DataLounge users, as non-subscribers were blocked from the DataLounge Forum during these periods. Though Mediapolis has received complaints about the policy, specifically that [...] "primetime" [...] periods are irregular and can often occur at times when site traffic should be at its slowest (e.g., North American overnight hours), DataLounge administrators assert that the [...] "primetime" [...] is necessary to prevent slowdowns of the other sites which Mediapolis hosts on the same servers, and preserves the existence of the DataLounge forum by generating revenue to cover DataLounge's hosting, bandwidth and maintenance expenses. In the summer of 2007 DataLounge instituted a policy that only paying members may start new threads, but in May 2009 DataLounge launched another comprehensive redesign of the site, dubbed [...] "V6," [...] one that allows users to embed photos and YouTube videos, as well as mark specific threads to watch. The new site is auto-refreshed in real-time as new posts are written, and nonpaying members were at first permitted to start threads, but that quickly changed. The DataLounge Webmaster explained in introducing the redesigned site that the transition was largely dictated by the effect of <b>tabbed</b> Web <b>browsing,</b> which resulted in users constantly using their browsers' refresh function and overloading the servers, sending the site into constant primetime mode. However, shortly after launching V6, the Webmaster reinstituted primetime, in part due to the quick proliferation of racist troll posts.|$|R
5000|$|The ECMDB's content may be {{explored}} or searched {{using a variety}} of database-specific tools. The text search box (located at the top of every ECMDB page) allows users to conduct a general text search of the database's textual data, including names, synonyms, numbers and identifiers. The ECMDB employs a software tool called [...] "Elastic Search" [...] that allows misspellings and fuzzy text matching. Using the text search, users may select either metabolites or proteins in the [...] "search for" [...] field using the pull-down box located {{on the right side of}} the text search box. In this way it is possible to restrict the search to only return results for those items associated with E. coli metabolites or with E. coli proteins. The ECMB has 7 selectable tabs located at the top of every page including: 1) Home; 2) Browse; 3) Search; 4) About; 5) Help; 6) Downloads and 7) Contact Us. The ECMDB's browser (accessed via the <b>Browse</b> <b>tab)</b> can be used to browse through the database and to re-sort its contents. Six different browse options are available: 1) Metabolite Browse (Fig. 1); 2) Protein Browse; 3) Reaction Browse (Fig. 2); 4) Pathway Browse (Fig. 3); 5) Class Browse; and 6) Concentration Browse. By selecting a specific Browse option the ECMDB's content can be displayed in a synoptic tabular format with the ECMDB identifiers, names and other data displayed in re-sortable tables. Clicking on an ECMDB MetaboCard or ProteinCard button will bring up the full data content for the corresponding metabolite (Fig. 4) or the corresponding protein. The ECMDB also offers a number of Search options listed Under the Search link. These include: 1) Chem Query; 2) Text Query; 3) Sequence Search; 4) Data Extractor; and 4 other MS or NMR spectral search tools. Chem Query option allows users to sketch or to type (via a SMILES string) a chemical compound and to search the ECMDB for metabolites similar or identical to the query compound. The Sequence Search can be used to perform BLAST (protein) sequence searches against all the protein sequences contained in ECMDB. Single and multiple sequence (i.e. whole proteome) BLAST queries are supported through this search tool. It is also possible to perform detailed spectral searches of ECMDB's reference compound NMR and MS spectral data through the ECMDB's MS, MS/MS, GC/MS and NMR Spectra Search links. These tools are intended to support the identification and characterization of bacterial (mainly E. coli) metabolites using NMR spectroscopy, GC-MS spectrometry and LC-MS spectrometry. The ECMDB also contains a large number of statistical tables, with detailed information about not only its content but also about E. coli, in general. In particular, under the [...] "About" [...] tab, a section called [...] "E. coli numbers and stats" [...] contains hundreds of interesting factoids about E. coli and E. coli physiology. Many components of the ECMDB are fully downloadable, including most of textual data, chemical structures and sequence data. These may be retrieved by clicking on the Download button, scrolling through the different files and selecting the appropriate hyperlinks.|$|R
40|$|The {{collections}} of four major Amsterdam map collections (the Special Collections of the University of Amsterdam, the Library of the Free University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam City Archives and the Library of the Royal Tropical Institute (KIT), Amsterdam) {{have been made}} visually accessible beginning with the map series in a pilot project. The maps are not only inventoried in the traditional way via text information, but also according to their locations on Google Maps. This not only provides Internet access to highly detailed maps {{from all over the}} world, but also provides the ability to overlay other information about the map via mashups. In a first pilot, a selection of maps whose positions are precisely determined based on the coordinates on the map sheets was made from a number of systematic map {{collections of}} the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. These maps are usually so exact that they can be projected on Google Maps precisely. The biggest problem is not the technology, but the incorporation of geographic datasets in major Content Management Systems (CMS) which are not designed to work with geographic data. Therefore, the application was developed in the Cloud environment of the Computing Centre SURFsara. In this first pilot, only the outer borders of all the sheets of the map series were included in the application. Since the used map sheets were provided with the coordinates of their vertices (corner edge points) and also border each other, only the coordinates of the first sheet had to be typed in. All the following sheets can be added by indicating to which side of the previous sheet they are situated (left, right, bottom, top). The result is a grid of rectangles on Google Maps. A click on a rectangle in the map window provides the text description of the map, which includes the reference to the official UvA-HvA catalogue. This is called a permalink, which is guaranteed to remain, even if the physical location of the map file would change. The map is directly available as a WMS (Web Mapping Service) and, as such, is not only approachable as images from other sites and computer applications, but is also available as a digital map ready for possible integration with own maps via overlays. The site of this application can be found via the URL [URL] In the second pilot, individually geo-referenced scanned map sheets were also included. As an example, all scans of the entire 1 : 50, 000 Soil Map of the Netherlands were incorporated in the application. The georeferenced scans are also included as ArcGIS Server services in the Geoportal of the University of Amsterdam and provided with metadata. Metadata for the maps and Web services in the UvA Geoportal can be implemented with the help of ArcMap and ArcCatalog or on the INSPIRE website [URL] The ArcGIS Server service of the Soil Map is found in the <b>Browse</b> <b>tab</b> of the UvA Geoportal, through the URL [URL] Eventually, the wealth of the cartographic world heritage will best be disclosed in a content management system (CMS) based on both advanced catalogue systems that work with text and keywords as well as those based on geographically oriented search systems.
