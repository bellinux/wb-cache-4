25|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that AM fungi release an unidentified diffusional factor, known as the myc factor, which activates the nodulation factor's inducible gene MtEnod11. This is the same gene involved in establishing symbiosis with the nitrogen fixing, rhizobial bacteria (Kosuta et al. 2003). When rhizobium bacteria are present in the soil, mycorrhizal colonization is increased due to an increase in the concentration of chemical signals involved in the establishment of symbiosis (Xie et al. 2003). Molecules similar <b>to</b> <b>Nod</b> factors were isolated from AM fungi and were shown to induce MtEnod11, lateral root formation and enhance mycorrhization. Effective mycorrhizal colonization can also increase the nodulations and symbiotic nitrogen fixation in mycorrhizal legumes.|$|E
25|$|On 2 May, Arsenal {{announced}} the line-up for the 2014 Emirates Cup, an annual tournament {{held at the}} Emirates Stadium. The tournament will consist of Arsenal (the hosts), Spanish side Valencia (who last participated in inaugural Emirates Cup), Portuguese side Benfica and Ligue 1 outfit Monaco. Arsenal will play Benfica on 2 August 2014, followed by Monaco a day later. The winners are crowned based on points accumulated and goals scored (with shots taken being taken into account if standings remain level). The last friendly to be announced for Arsenal {{turned out to be}} the opening fixture of the pre-season schedule, with the non-World Cup participating squad members involved against Conference South side Boreham Wood. The match finished 2–0 to the Gunners following second half strikes from Kristoffer Olsson in the 68th minute and a penalty from striker Benik Afobe in the 86th minute in what proved to be a stern test for Arsène Wenger's side. Arsenal began their Emirates Cup campaign opening to Benfica on 2 August. Starting the match with a high tempo, Arsenal found the breakthrough in the 26th minute following a goal by Yaya Sanogo, who scored his first goal in his Arsenal career, despite having 14 first team appearances last term. Arsenal continued the high tempo, and five minutes before time, Héctor Bellerín picked out Joel Campbell, who struck a volley past goalkeeper Artur to give Arsenal a two-goal advantage. Sanogo soon completed his hat-trick by netting twice in the space of as many minutes, as he first rolled into an empty net and then prodded past Artur after being picked out from the left by Kieran Gibbs. Arsenal entered half time with a 4–0 lead, and looked sure to progress further into the competition. Four minutes after the restart and Sanogo had his fourth, with Artur spilling a low drive from Ramsey into his path before calmly slotting home. However, Benfica pulled one back just past the hour mark, with a long throw from Maxi Pereira touched on for Nicolás Gaitán <b>to</b> <b>nod</b> in from close range, but Arsenal managed to progress after a busy afternoon in North London, with the match showcasing the debuts of Chilean Alexis Sánchez from the bench, along with Wenger opting to start £16million signing Calum Chambers.|$|E

500|$|When {{it became}} clear Taft would be renominated, Roosevelt and his {{supporters}} bolted the party; the former president asked Borah to chair the organizational meeting of his new Progressive Party, but the Idahoan refused. Borah would not countenance leaving the Republican Party and did not support any of the presidential candidates (the Democrats nominated New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson). [...] When Roosevelt came to Boise on a campaign swing in October, Borah {{felt he had to}} greet the former president and sit on the platform as Roosevelt spoke, though he was unwilling to endorse him. [...] Roosevelt told in his speech of a long list of state delegate votes he said had been stolen from him, and after each, turned to Borah and asked, [...] "Isn't that so, Senator Borah?" [...] giving him no choice but <b>to</b> <b>nod.</b> [...] It is not clear whether Borah voted for Roosevelt or Taft, he later stated both at different times. The main issue in Idaho was Borah's re-election, which was so popular that those disgruntled at the senator for not supporting Taft or Roosevelt kept quiet. Idahoans helped elect Wilson, but sent 80 Republican legislators out of 86 to Boise (with two of the six Democrats pledged to support Borah if necessary), who on January 14, 1913 returned William Borah for a second term.|$|E
500|$|Lucy Mangan of The Guardian responded positively, noting it [...] "manages brilliantly <b>to</b> <b>nod</b> to {{just about}} every Whovian in-joke, {{demographic}} and fetish within the span of two tiny installments". The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn opined that the two Amys in [...] "Space" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] were [...] "a lot more fun to watch" [...] than the two in the sixth series episode [...] "The Girl Who Waited". Tor.com's Teresa Jusino, who had positive towards Amy's character in the past, was disappointed that {{the ending of the}} miniepisodes relied on [...] "too-easy, dated, sexist humor". She cited the fact that Rory dropping the coupling was blamed on Amy's short skirt rather than Rory himself, which implied that she had a [...] "responsibility to cover up, because 'men will be men'". In Who is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Robert Smith wrote that the episode was [...] "cute, plotted to perfection and ends precisely when it should, before it has the chance to outstay its welcome". He said that the episodes used Amy well, as it did not make her unlikable. On the other hand, his coauthor Graeme Burk said that the story was [...] "derivative and lazy" [...] and a [...] "missed opportunity". He likened the plot to that of Red Dwarf [...] "Future Echoes", and felt that Moffat could have written something better and funnier. Like Jusino, he thought that the [...] "blokey humor" [...] was [...] "misplaced", denying a broad audience appeal and leading to the sexist last line: [...] "Pond, put some trousers on!". Despite this, both Jusino and Burk enjoyed the scene where Amy flirts with herself.|$|E
500|$|Amenhotep was deified {{upon his}} death and made the patron deity of the village which he opened at Deir el-Medina. His mother, who lived {{at least one year}} longer than he did, was also deified upon her death and became part of his litany. As {{previously}} mentioned, the vast majority of Amenhotep's statuary {{comes in the form of}} a funerary idol from this cult during later periods. When being worshiped, he had three deific manifestations: [...] "Amenhotep of the Town," [...] "Amenhotep Beloved of Amun," [...] and [...] "Amenhotep of the Forecourt," [...] and was known as a god who produced oracles. Some of the questions asked of him have been preserved on ostraca from Deir el-Medina, and appear to have been phrased in such a way that the idol of the king could nod (or be caused <b>to</b> <b>nod)</b> the answer. He also had a number of feasts dedicated to him which were held throughout the year. During the first month, a festival was celebrated in honor of the appearance of Amenhotep to the necropolis workmen, which probably means his idol was taken to Deir el-Medina. Another feast was held on the thirtieth of the fourth month, and then two more were held in the seventh month. The first was the [...] "spreading of the funeral couch for king Amenhotep," [...] which probably commemorated the day of his death. The second, celebrated for four days at the very end of the month, was the [...] "great festival of king Amenhotep lord of the town." [...] Later in Egyptian history, the seventh month was named after this festival, [...] "Phamenoth." [...] Another festival was held on the 27th of the ninth month, and the last known festival was held for several days between at least the eleventh and thirteenth days of the eleventh month, which in all probability commemorated the date of Amenhotep's accession to the throne.|$|E

2500|$|A {{makeshift}} {{gas chamber}} {{was set up}} at the butcher shop of the prison. At least one cat {{was used to test}} the lethal effectiveness of the chamber. Gee was to be strapped onto a chair in the chamber, which was eleven feet long, ten feet wide, and eight feet high. A small window next to the wooden chair allowed witnesses to look inside. Attendees included news reporters, public health officials, and representatives of the U.S. Army. Gee wept as he was placed on the chair until the captain of the guards told him to [...] "Brace up!" [...] At 9:40a.m. on February 8, 1924, the pump sprayed four pounds of hydrocyanic acid into the chamber. The weather was cold and humid. Because an electric heater failed, the chamber was 52 degrees Fahrenheit instead of the ideal 75 degrees, causing some of the acid to form a puddle on the floor. Gee appeared to lose consciousness in about five seconds, with his head continuing <b>to</b> <b>nod</b> up and down for six minutes. He was completely motionless after ten minutes. Some of the witnesses momentarily thought they smelled the odor of almond blossoms, a telltale sign of cyanide, leaking from the chamber. The warden had the witnesses cleared from the area. At about 10 a.m., a vent was opened and a fan was turned on to discharge the poison gas. The prison staff waited for the remaining puddle of hydrocyanic acid to evaporate before cleaning up the chamber. Gee's body was removed from the chamber at 12:20p.m. and taken to the prison hospital. A group of seven doctors pronounced him dead, but did not conduct an autopsy on the body out of concern that some remaining gas could be released. Gee was 29 years old when he died.|$|E
