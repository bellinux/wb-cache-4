5|$|German ethnologist Thomas Barthel, {{who first}} {{published}} the rongorongo corpus, identified three {{lines on the}} recto (side a) of tablet C, also known as Mamari, as a lunar calendar. Guy proposed {{that it was more}} precisely an astronomical rule for whether one or two intercalary nights should be inserted into the 28-night Rapanui month to keep it in sync with the phases of the moon, and if one night, whether this should come before or after the full moon. Berthin and Berthin propose that it is the text which follows <b>the</b> <b>identified</b> calendar which shows where the intercalary nights should appear. The Mamari calendar is the only example of rongorongo whose function is currently accepted as being understood, though it cannot actually be read.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to obtain a prenatal diagnosis for an embryo or fetus in the womb, using fetal genetic material acquired through chorionic villus sampling. An amniocentesis can be performed if the pregnancy is further along, within 14–18 weeks. This procedure looks at the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby for indicators of the HD mutation. This, too, can be paired with exclusion testing to avoid disclosure of parental genotype. Prenatal testing can be done when a parent has been diagnosed with HD, when they have had genetic testing showing {{the expansion of the}} HTT gene, or when they have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The parents can be counseled on their options, which include termination of pregnancy, and on the difficulties of a child with <b>the</b> <b>identified</b> gene.|$|E
5|$|Large Danubian {{complexes}} were {{in recent}} years excavated in the Targowisko and Szarów (Wieliczka County) area of fertile loessial hills. The settlements, which included massive post construction houses even over 50 meters long as well as industrial facilities, extended continuously over a stretch of land more than three kilometers long. Some of <b>the</b> <b>identified</b> structures functioned together, {{as was the case}} when the buildings were connected by a courtyard and protected by a common fence.|$|E

5|$|Psoriasis has {{a strong}} {{hereditary}} component, and many genes are associated with it, but {{it is unclear how}} those genes work together. Most of <b>the</b> <b>identified</b> genes relate to the immune system, particularly the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and T cells.

5|$|The {{cemetery}} contained 245 German and 188 British graves {{at the end}} of the war. This number {{increased in}} the post-war period, as both British and German remains from numerous isolated burial locations were concentrated to St. Symphorien until the cemetery reached its current number of 284 German soldiers and 229 Commonwealth soldiers. Most of <b>the</b> <b>identified</b> German dead in the cemetery died in 1914 and were from units of IX Corps, which originated from the north of Germany from towns like Kiel, Hamburg and Bremen, and in Schleswig-Holstein.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>identified</b> seven {{ecotypes}} inhabit isolated ecological niches. Of three orca ecotypes in the Antarctic, one preys on minke whales, {{the second}} on seals and penguins {{and the third}} on fish. Another ecotype lives in the eastern North Atlantic, while the three Northeast Pacific ecotypes are labeled the transient, resident and offshore populations, as discussed above. The research supported a proposal to reclassify the Antarctic seal- and fish-eating populations and the North Pacific transients as a distinct species, leaving the remaining ecotypes as subspecies. The first split in the orca population, between the North Pacific transients and the rest, occurred an estimated 700,000 years ago. Such a designation would mean that each new species becomes subject to separate conservation assessments.|$|E

30|$|Inverse source {{problems}} arise in many branches {{of science and}} engineering, e.g. heat conduction, crack identification, electromagnetic theory, geophysical prospecting, and pollutant detection. For the heat source identification, {{there have been a}} large number of research results for different forms of heat source [1 – 9]. To the author’s knowledge, there were few papers for identifying an unknown source in the Poisson equation using the regularization method. In [10], <b>the</b> authors <b>identified</b> <b>the</b> unknown point source with the logarithmic potential. In [11], <b>the</b> author <b>identified</b> <b>the</b> unknown point source using the projective method. In [12], <b>the</b> authors <b>identified</b> <b>the</b> unknown point source using the Green’s function. In [13, 14], <b>the</b> authors <b>identified</b> <b>the</b> unknown source dependent only on one variable using the dual reciprocity method. In [15], <b>the</b> authors <b>identified</b> <b>the</b> unknown source dependent only on one variable using the method of fundamental solution. But by the regularization method, there are a few papers with strict theoretical analysis on <b>identifying</b> <b>the</b> unknown source.|$|R
5|$|It {{was clear}} from the {{beginning}} of the CryoSat programme that an extensive series of measurements would be needed, both to understand interaction of the radar waves with the surface of the ice caps and to relate the measured freeboard of floating sea ice with its thickness. This latter, in particular, would have to take account of snow loading. For sea ice, which moves as it is blown by the wind, it was also necessary to develop techniques which could give consistent results when measured from platforms travelling at different speed (scientists on the surface, helicopter-towed sounders, aircraft-borne radars and CryoSat itself). A number of campaigns were performed under a programme called CRYOVEX which aimed to address each of <b>the</b> <b>identified</b> areas of uncertainty. These campaigns continued through the development of the original CryoSat and were planned to continue after its launch.|$|E
