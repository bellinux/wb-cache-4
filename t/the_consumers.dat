Pearson was in favour of the disestablishment of the Church of England and opposed capital punishment.

5|$|The {{flexibility}} of Brazilian FFVs empowers <b>the</b> <b>consumers</b> {{to choose the}} fuel depending on current market prices. As ethanol fuel economy is lower than gasoline because of ethanol's energy content is close to 34% less per unit volume than gasoline, flex cars running on ethanol get a lower mileage than when running on pure gasoline. However, this effect is partially offset by the usually lower price per liter of ethanol fuel. As a rule of thumb, Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the media to use more alcohol than gasoline in their mix only when ethanol prices are 30% lower or more than gasoline, as ethanol price fluctuates heavily depending on the result of seasonal sugar cane harvests.|$|E

5000|$|Seduction can {{be split}} into two {{separate}} forms, confidence games (con-game) and play [...] depending {{on the nature of}} the relationship developed between marketer and customer.

With play, the unsustainability of the exchange is not hidden from <b>the</b> <b>consumer,</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> plays along simply for the reward of playing, for instance an older child may still play along with believing in Santa Claus for the rewards. Within marketing, playing along with the seducer is seen as fundamental to the seduction of <b>the</b> <b>consumer,</b> with <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> playing a role in the exchange.
