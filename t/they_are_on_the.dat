He is soon confronted by Jose, an acquaintance from his own time, who gives Cole a handgun and ambiguously instructs him to follow orders. At the same time, Railly spots Dr. Peters, and recognizes him from a newspaper photograph as an assistant at Goines' father's virology lab. Peters is about to embark on a tour of several cities that match the locations and sequence of the viral outbreaks.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the play, {{the actors}} file out slowly (most {{important}} first, with gaps between actors), and while <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bridge (hashigakari), the audience claps restrainedly. Between actors, clapping ceases, then begins again as the next actor leaves. Unlike in western theatre, there is no bowing, nor do the actors return to the stage after having left. A play may end with the shite character leaving the stage as part of the story (as in Kokaji, for instance)—rather than ending with all characters on stage—in which case one claps as the character exits.|$|E

5|$|Cubs start {{following}} their mothers at six weeks. The mother frequently shifts the cubs to new locations. A study of play behaviour of cheetah cubs showed that cubs tend to play after nursing or while <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> move with their mothers. Play involves plenty of agility; attacks are seldom lethal. Playing cubs stay near their mothers. The study further revealed {{that while the}} cubs showed improvement in catching {{each other as they}} grew up, the ability to crouch and hide did not develop remarkably. Thus, it was suggested that play helps develop only certain aspects of predator defence. Weaning occurs at three to six months of age. The mother brings kills to her cubs; the cubs might purr as the mother licks them clean after the meal. Cubs as young as six months try to capture small prey like hares and juvenile gazelles. However, they may have to wait until as long as 15 months of age to make a successful kill on their own.|$|E
5|$|Feeling lonely, Natasha {{goes out}} {{clubbing}} and meets Ivan DeMarco (Ben Knight), an older man. Michael discovers {{the relationship and}} bans Natasha from seeing Ivan. However, Natasha continues {{to see him in}} secret and when Ivan asks her for some naked pictures, she sends him some. Natasha learns Ivan has been showing the pictures to his friends and that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> internet. She initially lies to Michael about who took the photos, but Michael learns the truth from Ivan. Natasha becomes desperate to win her father's favour back and she sprays the street with derogatory graffiti about herself. However, Michael discovers she was responsible for the graffiti and he disowns her. After she is taunted about her appearance, Natasha decides to get rhinoplasty and uses Michael's credit card to pay the deposit. Natasha then sells some of her father's records to raise the money and Michael decides to send her to a boarding school. He changes his mind after Natasha nearly drowns in the pool at Number 30 and their relationship begins to improve.|$|E
5|$|Low on {{funds for}} an {{upcoming}} competition trip, glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) suggests that the club members sell saltwater taffy to raise money. New Directions members Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.), Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) and Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) reveal <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> academic decathlon team, which is also having funding problems. Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) is the fourth, stand-in member, and proves surprisingly knowledgeable about cat diseases. Will's girlfriend, substitute teacher Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow), suggests holding a benefit concert for the decathlon team instead of selling additional taffy. Former McKinley student Sunshine Corazon (Charice), who defected to rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline, is awarded the closing number at the concert after promising to bring her six hundred Twitter followers.|$|E

5|$|The body of {{the soft}} tick, family Argasidae, is pear-shaped or oval with a rounded {{anterior}} portion. The mouthparts cannot be seen from above as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ventral surface. The cuticle is leathery; {{there is often a}} centrally positioned dorsal plate, with ridges which project slightly above the surrounding surface, but there is no decoration. A pattern of small, circular depressed areas show where muscles are attached to the interior of the integument. The eyes are {{on the sides of the}} body, the spiracles open between legs 3 and 4, and males and females only differ in the structure of the genital pore.|$|E
5|$|The first {{polio vaccine}} was the inactivated polio vaccine. It was {{developed}} by Jonas Salk and came into use in 1955.

Clinical disease, including paralysis, caused by vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is indistinguishable from that caused by wild polioviruses. This is believed to be a rare event, but outbreaks of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP), caused by a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV), have been reported, and tend to occur in areas of low coverage by OPV, presumably because the OPV is itself protective against the related outbreak strain.|$|E
5|$|The two journey out, {{finding a}} river {{that they were}} unaware of; the couple follow the river and make {{observations}} as they go. While resting under a tree, the man finds {{the remains of a}} campsite, discovering that the area they were in has been inhabited. Later, they find another campsite and massive, oddly shaped trees with markings on one. They find a decrepit boat they could use to cross the river, but continue up into the mountains. While climbing a small hill, the man sees a snake and tumbles down on the woman. Further on, they hear chirping in a tree, and pause briefly to observe a bird and its chick in a nest. While resting at a miniature river, the woman discovers that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cliff of a large waterfall. After contemplating it, they decide to discover what the mountains are like.|$|E

5|$|When the Indian flag is {{displayed}} with non-national flags, including corporate flags and advertising banners, the rules state {{that if the}} flags are on separate staffs, the flag of India {{should be in the}} middle, or the furthest left from the viewpoint of the onlookers, or at least one flag's breadth higher than the other flags in the group. Its flagpole must be {{in front of the other}} poles in the group, but if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same staff, it must be the uppermost flag. If the flag is carried in procession with other flags, it must be at the head of the marching procession, or if carried with a row of flags in line abreast, it must be carried to the marching right of the procession.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest {{games have}} an overall upbeat feeling. The typical Dragon Quest plot {{involves}} the player controlling {{a party of}} heroes to defeat an ultimate evil villain, who usually threatens the world in some way. The plot-line often consists of smaller stories that involve encounters with other characters. This linear plot-line is intentional, to help ease the generally high learning curve RPGs have for those unaccustomed to them. The gameplay is designed to allow players to decide when, and whether, to pursue certain storyline paths. To ensure players continue to enjoy playing the game, no storyline path is made without some kind of reward and, to help ease players who may be apprehensive about whether <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right path, the distance the character has to travel to get rewarded is reduced {{at the beginning of}} the game. While the player never starts the game in a wholly non-linear way, they usually allow players to explore an open world in a non-linear manner following an early linear section of the game. Early character levels start players off with more hit points and a substantially increasing growth at later levels, although the effective bonuses of every additional level decreases.|$|E
