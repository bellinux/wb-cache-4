5|$|The {{next five}} days saw very heavy {{fighting}} as the Soviets slowly advanced through heavy German defences and repelled German counterattacks. On January 13, bad weather prevented the Soviet side from employing their air force. That day they gained almost no ground and incurred heavy losses. The German side, after their counterattacks {{had failed to}} <b>throw</b> <b>back</b> the Soviet troops, started further reinforcing the area by assembling battle groups using portions of divisions from the quiet parts of the front. These included battle groups from the 1st Infantry Division, the 61st Infantry Division, the 5th Mountain Division and the SS Police Division.|$|E
5|$|Vanderbilt {{jumped out}} to a 17–0 lead on a rain-soaked field. A Curry pass to captain Cohen opened the scoring. Josh Cody took over himself from that point. In one of the {{greatest}} exhibitions of punt covering, Cody smothered the receiver every time, recovering two fumbles, one across the goal line for a touchdown. Then, in the last ten seconds of play, Cody drop kicked a three-pointer from the 33-yard line. Tom Zerfoss and Friel punted well. Curry's leadership was superb, and late in the game the Vanderbilt line rose as one to <b>throw</b> <b>back</b> three Auburn charges on the five-yard line. The starting lineup was Hayes (left end), Cody (left tackle), Williams (left guard), Reyer (center), Hamilton (right guard), Lipscomb (right tackle), Cohen (right end), Curry (quarterback), Floyd (left halfback), Zerfoss (right halfback), and Wiggs (fullback).|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} unique Titan classes, {{variants}} of light, medium, and heavy, with inversely related speed and armor: the all-rounder Atlas, the bulky Ogre, and the fleet-footed Stryder. The latter two chassis are unlocked upon finishing both faction campaigns and were later made unlockable by leveling up as well. Each chassis has a respective Core power that {{works on a}} cooldown timer: respectively, increased damage, increased shields, and unlimited dashes. Titan tactical ability options include stopping enemy ammunition in midair to <b>throw</b> <b>back</b> in their direction, emitting electrified smoke to hurt and repel pilots climbing the Titan's back, and deploying a defensive wall. Additionally, players can equip two perk kits to customize for their preferred strategy. Their primary weapons include rocket launchers, lightning cannons, and chainguns. Titans can act autonomously when put in guard and follow modes, which directs the Titan either to protect their vicinity or to tail their pilot, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy transported the {{division}} to Tobruk from 19September to 25October, in a politically controversial move {{to relieve the}} mainly Australian garrison which had been defending the port for almost seven months, {{since the beginning of}} the Siege of Tobruk. Under daily aerial and artillery attacks, {{the division}} defended the port and conducted nightly offensive patrols against German and Italian positions. On 18November, the British Eighth Army launched Operation Crusader. The division was tasked with breaking out of Tobruk, following the destruction of the Axis armoured forces. Following unexpected early success, the division began its attacks on 21November, before the armoured formations of Germans and Italians had been defeated. Heavy fighting soon followed as the division captured several well-defended and dug-in German and Italian strong points. The looming threat of the Axis tanks ended the break-out offensive the following day. Renewed fighting on 26November saw the division link up with the approaching New Zealand Division, cutting the Axis lines of communication. In response, the Germans launched several counter-attacks to <b>throw</b> <b>back</b> the 70th Division from the territory they had gained. The failure of these attacks had a lasting strategic impact on Operation Crusader; the Axis forces began their retreat and lifted the siege of Tobruk. Two men—from units attached to the division—were awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions during Operation Crusader.|$|E

25|$|Demolitions {{were carried}} out along the road between Lehovo and Kleisoura in order to delay the German advance. The first contact was made at 17:00 on 13 April. German forward {{elements}} attacked the Greek line, particularly battalion I/87 on height Sargonitsa. With intense effort and artillery support, the attacking Germans managed at 21:00 to <b>throw</b> <b>back</b> the I/87 in disarray, its elements retreating towards heights 1597 and 1623. The 1st company of the battalion, deployed on the left of its line, surrendered to the Germans except for one platoon.|$|E
25|$|Before 1921, it {{was common}} for a {{baseball}} to be in play for over 100 pitches. Players used the same ball until it started to unravel. Early baseball leagues were very cost-conscious, so fans had to <b>throw</b> <b>back</b> balls that had been hit into the stands. The longer the ball was in play, the softer it became—and hitting a heavily used, softer ball for distance {{is much more difficult}} than hitting a new, harder one. The ball itself was softer to begin with, probably making home runs less likely.|$|E
25|$|Knežević led his hussars with {{distinction}} at the Battle of the Trebbia on 17 to 20 June 1799. In this action, {{his unit}} {{was part of}} Friedrich Heinrich von Gottesheim's Avantgarde of the Left Column. On 19 June, the hussars helped <b>throw</b> <b>back</b> François Watrin's French division. He was also at the Battle of Novi on 15 August. In that action, the Palatine Hussars fought in Pál Kray's corps. From 16 November to 3 December, he and his hussars participated in the siege of Cuneo {{under the command of}} Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein. At the end, the 3,000-man garrison surrendered the fortress with 187 guns and 14,000 hundredweight of gunpowder.|$|E

25|$|To be an {{efficient}} manufacturing facility, a loomshop needed good daylight, controlled ventilation, un-obstructed space, provision for storage, heat, and access for goods and workers. Hand looms were manual, the artisan raised the heddles using foot levers, {{and threw the}} shuttle {{the width of the}} loom by hand, forward and back. The left hand was used to operate the batten that compressed the pick. Broader cloth could not be woven this way, so the weaver used a child to <b>throw</b> <b>back</b> the shuttle. John Kay's flying shuttle of 1733, removed the need for the child. The weaver jerked the two hammers or pickers with a picking stick held in the right hand. The pickers propelled the shuttle, and the left hand operated the batten.|$|E
25|$|In 1257, Crown Prince Trần Hoảng {{witnessed}} the first Mongol invasion in Vietnam. In the beginning, Đại Việt's army suffered several defeats by the Mongols {{who had already}} conquered a vast area in Asia. Several high-ranking officials of Trần dynasty were so frightened that Prince Khâm Thiên Trần Nhật Hiệu, younger brother of Thái Tông, even suggested the Emperor that they might escape from Đại Việt to the Song dynasty. But because of the firm faith of the Emperor Thái Tông, grand chancellor Trần Thủ Độ and the talents of generals such as Prince Hưng Đạo Trần Quốc Tuấn and Lê Phụ Trần, the Trần dynasty was able to <b>throw</b> <b>back</b> the invasion and ultimately re-established the peace in Đại Việt in December 1257.|$|E
25|$|For {{thousands}} of years, male homosexuality {{was referred to}} in literature by alluding to two semi-legendary figures from the early Zhou Dynasty. The first was Mizi Xia and the half-eaten peach which he shared with his lover, the actual historical figure, Duke Ling of Wei. The second was Lord Long Yang, who convinced an unnamed King of Wei to remain faithful to him by comparing himself to a small fish which the King might <b>throw</b> <b>back</b> if a larger fish came along. While both Mizi Xia and Lord Long Yang may have actually existed, nothing is known about them beyond their defining stories, and their presence in Chinese literature was very much that of legendary characters who served as archetypes of homosexual love.|$|E

Yazdegerd fled eastward from Ctesiphon, leaving behind him most of the Empire's vast treasury. The Arabs captured Ctesiphon shortly afterward, acquiring a powerful financial resource and leaving the Sassanid government strapped for funds. A number of Sassanid governors attempted to combine their forces to <b>throw</b> <b>back</b> the invaders, but the effort was crippled {{by the lack of}} a strong central authority, and the governors were defeated at the Battle of Nihawānd. The empire, with its military command structure non-existent, its non-noble troop levies decimated, its financial resources effectively destroyed, and the Asawaran (Azatan) knightly caste destroyed piecemeal, was now utterly helpless {{in the face of the}} invaders.|$|E
25|$|The {{fight was}} not {{over as the}} 19th U.S. Infantry's skirmishers were {{cut off from the}} main body of {{defenders}} and were overwhelmed. The remaining troops of the 18th U.S. Infantry, accompanied by Private Carson, had to withdraw to King's third line of defense, which was manned by Carson's 15th U.S. Infantry Regiment. With the arrival of some timely reinforcements, the Union left wing was strong enough to <b>throw</b> <b>back</b> the Confederate attack, although the battle continued. Since the north or left end of the Union line was the only location where serious fighting had been taking place, Rosecrans ordered several units, including Brigadier General John Milton Brannan's division to shift to the north. For the second time that morning, Brannan decided it would imperil the Union line to move and he kept his men where they were, but Brigadier General Thomas J. Wood obeyed Rosecrans's order to fill the supposed gap that Brannan's departure would create. This blunder opened a real gap in the Union line. Eleven thousand Confederates moved into the gap, collapsing the southern portion of the Union line. About half the Union Army of the Cumberland began to flee the battlefield {{while the rest of the}} army was unaware of the disaster. Nonetheless, Thomas's divisions, with timely reinforcement by Brigadier General Gordon Granger's Reserve Division, were able to hold their position and withdraw that evening in order because of the defense and delaying actions of their rear guard.|$|E

500|$|A small {{final action}} {{to gain a}} nearby {{crossroad}} and the remaining high ground north of the village near Hill 52, was set to be launched 10 November. The road junction was [...] north of Passchendaele along the highway to Westrozebeke. Hill 52, the highest point on {{the northern end of}} the Passchendaele Ridge, was [...] beyond the crossroad. Possession of both features would permit observation over German positions to the north-east. The attack was made the responsibility of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade, with support from one battalion of the 4th Canadian Infantry Brigade. The Germans had taken advantage of the break in the fighting to relieve exhausted units. Regiments from the 4th Division and 44th Reserve Division replaced those of the 11th Division on 9 November. Nevertheless, the assault was launched from the Green Line, north and north-east of Mosselmarkt, on the morning of 10 November. The assault made good initial progress, capturing the crossroad, over-running Venture Farm and capturing four 77mm field guns. However, north of the Canadian Corps boundary, the supporting advance by the British 1st Division ran into difficulties when a German counterattack got between the 1st Battalion, South Wales Borderers and the 2nd Battalion, Royal Munster Fusiliers after they diverged. The Germans were able to fire against the British inner flanks, causing many casualties and forcing the survivors to withdraw. Troops of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade had to fill the gap and <b>throw</b> <b>back</b> a defensive flank along the corps boundary, preventing further progress. Though Haig had hoped to have the entire Passchendaele–Westrozebeke ridge as a winter position, the line was still short of the village; later attempts to reach Westrozebeke in late November and early December also failed.|$|E
