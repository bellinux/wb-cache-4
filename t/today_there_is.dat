5|$|During the Iron Age, a Celtic {{language}} and culture emerged in Ireland. How and when the island of Ireland became Celtic has been debated for close to a century, with the migrations of the Celts {{being one of the}} more enduring themes of archaeological and linguistic studies. <b>Today,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> more than one school of thought on how this occurred in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|<b>Today,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a {{large number}} of organisations campaigning in favor of {{establishing}} a Third Spanish Republic; Data from 2006 suggest that only 25 per cent of Spaniards are in favor of establishing a republic; however, the numbers have increased since Juan Carlos I abdicated.|$|E

5|$|The central nave is groin-vaulted, each bay being {{separated}} {{from one another}} by pointed transverse arches with rectangular profiles. The nave arcades are carried on cruciform piers with an engaged column on each face, sitting on a raised plinth. The two aisles of the mosque are also groin-vaulted. Ibn Battuta noted that the Great Mosque had a white marble minbar ("pulpit"); it still exists <b>today.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> a small mihrab in the mosque with an inscription dating from 1663, containing the name of Musa Pasha, a governor of Gaza during Ottoman rule.|$|E
5|$|The first Westbound Pony Express trip left St. Joseph on April 3, 1860 {{and arrived}} {{ten days later}} in San Francisco, California, on April 14. These letters were sent under cover from the East to St. Joseph, and never {{directly}} entered the U.S. mail system. <b>Today</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> only a single letter known to exist from the inaugural westbound trip from St. Joseph, Missouri to San Francisco, California. The mailing depicted below is on a pre-stamped (embossed) envelope, first issued by the U.S. Post Office in 1855, used five years later here.|$|E
5|$|The street started {{being used}} for {{commercial}} purposes {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century and houses were converted for this use. Ground floors became used as shops, while upper floors and back rooms were used as workshops, particularly for metalwork. Augustus Siebe, the pioneer of the diving helmet, lived and worked on the street, and <b>today</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an English Heritage blue plaque commemorating him on the house where he lived.|$|E

5|$|<b>Today</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{widespread}} {{agreement among}} archaeologists that the world's first art and symbolic culture {{dates to the}} southern African Middle Stone Age. Some {{of the most striking}} artifacts, including engraved pieces of red ochre, were manufactured at Blombos Cave in South Africa 70 ka. Pierced and ochred Nassarius shell beads were also recovered from Blombos, with even earlier examples (Middle Stone Age, Aterian) from the Taforalt Caves. Arrows and hide working tools have been found at Sibudu Cave as evidence of making weapons with compound heat treated gluing technology.|$|E
5|$|A {{school was}} founded in Deir Ghassaneh in 1925. Prior to the British Mandate period, boys would {{normally}} receive education in a kuttab, an elementary-type school with Islamic law and tradition having {{a major influence on}} the curriculum. <b>Today,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> one elementary school (Bani Zeid Elementary School) and one secondary school (Bashir al-Barghouti Secondary School) in the town of Bani Zeid, both run by the government. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Education and Higher Education, in the 2010-2011 academic year there were 26 classes occupied by 691 students, both male and female. There was 45 teaching staff. There are no kindergartens in Bani Zeid. The closest institution for higher learning is Birzeit University in the village of Bir Zeit to the southeast.|$|E
5|$|Formerly, men {{not wearing}} {{military}} uniform wore knee breeches of an 18th-century design. Women's evening dress included trains and tiaras or feathers {{in their hair}} (or both). The dress code governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed. After World WarI, when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts {{a few inches from}} the ground, she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king's reaction. King GeorgeV was horrified, so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low. Following their accession in 1936, King GeorgeVI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. <b>Today,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no official dress code. Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits; a minority wear morning coats, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, black tie or white tie.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} 20th century {{to at least}} the mid-1980s, {{educational}} policies in Mexico focused on the hispanicization (castellanización) of indigenous communities, teaching only Spanish and discouraging the use of indigenous languages. As a result, <b>today</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no group of Nahuatl speakers having attained general literacy in Nahuatl; while their literacy rate in Spanish also remains {{much lower than the}} national average. Even so, Nahuatl is still spoken by well over a million people, of whom around 10% are monolingual. The survival of Nahuatl as a whole is not imminently endangered, but the survival of certain dialects is, and some dialects have already become extinct within the last few decades of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|RAF Weston-super-Mare {{was opened}} in 1936 by No. 24 Group, {{with a single}} tarmac runway. It served as a flying {{candidates}} selection and initial training facility, and as a relief airport during World War II, latterly as the Polish Air Force Staff College from April 1944 to April 1946. After the war it served as a logistics supply station, with helicopter makers Westland Helicopters on site until closure in 1987. <b>Today</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an operational heliport on site used occasionally by the RAF Search and Rescue service. The former Westland site, which closed in 2002, houses the Helicopter Museum featuring examples of Westland aircraft. Pride of place is given to an immaculate Westland Wessex HCC Mk.4, formerly of the Queen's Flight.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland State Highway Administration {{transferred}} {{maintenance of}} Queens Chapel Road from MD 410 to US 1 {{to the town}} of University Park in August 1988 ahead of the construction of the Washington Metro's Green Line underneath the town; the town subsequently closed the road through town. A 1991 traffic study showed the majority of traffic along the University Park segment of Queens Chapel Road was through traffic before it was closed, and recommended the highway be closed {{at the southern end of}} town and only allow traffic to exit the town onto US 1. After Metro construction was completed in the summer of 1992, the University Park Town Council elected to keep the road closed to through traffic; this measure was affirmed by a town referendum in January 1993. <b>Today,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a cul-de-sac at the southwest end of town adjacent to the MD 500MD 410 intersection; the intersection with US 1 at the northeast end of town only allows traffic to exit Queens Chapel Road.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the mid-18th century planting, {{although}} there remains, in front of the house, a gnarled black mulberry tree, which was described as ancient in 1822. However, 19th-century drawings and photographs record increasingly elaborate and fussy bedding schemes, finally swept away in the 1960s. <b>Today</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a more informal style, emphasising the architectural character of the garden with its long straight sweeps of wall; it is also an easier style to maintain. In recent years, native wild plants have been allowed to mingle with rare and exotic specimens and continual thought is being given to contrasting textures and colours of foliage. The lower garden, below the front of the house, now has the air of a small arboretum with a number of fine specimen trees, such as a splendid late-leafing catalpa (an oriental plane tree) dominates this part of the garden and the grass at its foot is left uncut during the Spring, allowing camassias and bluebells to make a fine showing.|$|E
