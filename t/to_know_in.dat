5|$|The Buccaneers {{were once}} again criticized for poor {{tackling}} and conservative play-calling following a loss to a previously winless St. Louis Cardinals team. This time, complaints came from the players as the Cardinals seemed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> advance which plays the Buccaneers would be running, and the Buccaneers waited until {{too late in the}} game to make adjustments. The Buccaneers led early, after Steve DeBerg's touchdown pass to Calvin Magee on a fake field goal. Steve Young's rushing and passing combined for 304 of the Buccaneers' 347 yards. The Cardinals unexpectedly used a soft zone defense instead of their usual blitzing, which contributed to Tampa Bay's decision to avoid the passing game until the fourth quarter. The Cardinals put the game away with Stump Mitchell's 31-yard fourth-quarter touchdown run, in which three Buccaneers missed tackles. Ron Holmes, Jeremiah Castille, Marvin Powell, and Gerald Carter all missed the game with injuries.|$|E

25|$|Like Thomas More, Bishop Fisher {{believed}} {{that because the}} statute condemned only those speaking maliciously against the King's new title, there was safety in silence.

This led him to propose that the priests must have had some form of computed calendar or calendrical rules that allowed them <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> advance whether a month would have 30 or 29 days, and whether a year would have 12 or 13 months.|$|E

25|$|In limited over matches (one innings matches), {{the team}} that scores more runs wins. So if team A scored 250 from 50 overs {{with the loss of}} 1 wicket (250–1), then the target for team B is to get 251. The number of wickets that has fallen does not affect which team has won. So if team B scored 251 but with the loss of 9 wickets (251–9), team B still won because it scored more runs, even though it lost more wickets. In a similar {{situation}} if team A scored 250/1, but team B scored 240 (all out), then team A would win because it scored more runs. Part way through a limited over match, to judge the likely final scores, it is important <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>in</b> addition to runs already scored and wickets already lost, how many overs each side has remaining, so this is always quoted.|$|E

500|$|Given {{the high}} levels of drug-related {{activities}} in northern Mexico and in Tamaulipas, many Facebook users also check Valor por Tamaulipas to verify if there is a shootout in their area, <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> what part of a highway a carjacking took place, or to see if someone is reported missing. The information found at Valor por Tamaulipas is shared by Internet users themselves; the administrator, on the other hand, was active almost all hours during the day and throughout the whole week. Most of the Mexican mainstream media outlets play down the violence because they fear reprisals from the country's criminal organizations. Given the censorship, Valor por Tamaulipas was a popular outlet for crime watchdogs concerned with the violence in Tamaulipas. According to crime journalist James Barger from InSight Crime, the information in Valor por Tamaulipas is [...] "spotty, sometimes unreliable, but often the only source of what [...] happening". Several Internet users in Mexico, the United States, and in other countries around the world have shown their support for Valor por Tamaulipas' work and have followed their reports on Facebook and/or Twitter.|$|E

500|$|... "Li'l Sebastian" [...] {{received}} highly positive reviews. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club {{called it}} the best Parks and Recreation episode so far, and compared the cliffhanger and [...] "many of the bittersweet moments leading to it" [...] to the comedy series Freaks and Geeks. James Poniewozik of Time magazine strongly praised [...] "Li'l Sebastian", and called {{it one of the}} best episodes of the season. He said Li'l Sebastian's funeral brought out the best in the characters, and that the episode [...] "combined slapstick, authentic stakes and a holistic picture of the oddball history and commonalities that bond the folks we've come <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> Pawnee". Henry Hanks of CNN called it [...] "one of the funniest half-hours of any show this season", and compared the Li'l Sebastian funeral to the funeral scenes in the Mary Tyler Moore Show episode [...] "Chuckles Bites the Dust". The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow called the episode a [...] "triumphant exclamation point at the end of Parks and Recreations third season", and described every moment as [...] "uproariously funny". Meslow particularly praised the twists and major character developments of the final 10 minutes, and said it demonstrates how much the show and characters have changed since the series debuted.|$|E

Inside a tiki hut, Spears exclaims the words she wants her boyfriend <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>In</b> {{the second half of}} the video, she is seen on a tree where her boyfriend reaches for her. There are also scenes where she is running on the beach and her boyfriend is chasing after her. Spears wears only a bikini top and a pair of cutoff shorts during the whole video. The music video was considered by Spears as [...] "the funnest video I've ever done." [...] An alternate footage of the video can be found on the DVD of Spears first compilation album [...] Vineyard considered the footage as the one that [...] "makes the most use of Britney's body of work, with the spaceman from [...] "Oops!...

500|$|In October 2009, actress Barbara Windsor's {{decision}} to leave EastEnders after sixteen years of portraying the character Peggy Mitchell was announced. The show's executive producer, Bryan Kirkwood, {{said it was a}} massive honour for him to be responsible for the character's exit, but explained that as she has become the [...] "quintessential matriarch of the show", they had to get the exit storyline right, which he said would be [...] "both epic and poignant". Windsor gave one year's notice of leaving, giving the production team time {{to come up with a}} storyline, and was asked to keep her decision a secret until the announcement was made. Kirkwood looked at Windsor's first episode and decided her exit should be about Peggy and her son Phil, as Peggy's arrival came at a time when Phil needed her most, and since then, she had believed that Phil still needed her. Peggy's exit came when she realised his mother was not what Phil needed. Windsor did not want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> advance how her character would leave, but hoped she would not be killed off. She commented: [...] "My exit was beautifully written and I really couldn’t have asked for a better send-off for Peggy." ...|$|E

500|$|The title {{received}} generally negative reviews. Video game magazines Nintendo Power and Electronic Gaming Monthly {{gave the}} title {{a score of}} 2.68 out of 5 and 5.62 out of 10 respectively, while the website Allgame rated it 3 out of 5 stars. Freelance critic Robert Schmitz gave the title a score of 0.5 out of 11, calling it [...] "awful" [...] and explaining the game is almost [...] "better left unsaid." [...] Schmitz blamed Enix's decision to base the game on a little-known cartoon series, a comment echoed by both the Video Game Bible. Electronic Gaming Monthly felt the graphics lack vibrant colors, but that the music was [...] "alright." [...] Allan Milligan, in a review for the Gaming Intelligence Agency, judged the graphics and audio both mediocre, the character designs [...] "terrible," [...] the plot generic and the puzzles not challenging. He noted {{that it is impossible}} for the player <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> advance which Knight is best suited for which boss. Milligan called the game [...] "staggeringly ill-conceived" [...] and likened it to a [...] "succession of fetch quests." [...] He criticized the fact that all enemies on a screen must be defeated to progress through some passages, and the possibility for characters and enemies to be hidden from the player's view behind large objects. The Knights' artificial intelligence was also denounced, as was the lack of animation when a character or enemy is hit.|$|E
500|$|Joel Keller, also of TV Squad, {{called it}} one of the best episodes of the season, and that it {{provided}} each member of the ensemble cast moments to shine. He praised how the episode combined the [...] "funny small-townness of a place like Pawnee and the realities of being in city government". James Poniewozik of Time magazine called it a [...] "splendid" [...] episode that [...] "combined slapstick, authentic stakes and a holistic picture of the oddball history and commonalities that bond the folks we've come <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> Pawnee". Punchline Magazine writer Megan Gilbert said the episode featured [...] "plenty of laugh-out-loud moments" [...] and particularly enjoyed the [...] "sweet non-aggressive fighting" [...] between April and Andy. Gilbert felt Adam Scott was underused, but praised the performances of Rashida Jones, Aziz Ansari and Mo Collins. TV Guide writer Damian Holbrook said the difficulties that plague the harvest festival were funny, [...] "but like the best of Parks, these hiccups are matched with acres of heart". He praised the growing romantic interest between Leslie and Ben, as well as the subplot about Andy and April. Alex Strachan of the Montreal Gazette praised the show for being funny without resorting to cynicism or cruel jokes, and called the series [...] "one of the sharpest, smartest comedies on TV at the moment". He also called the Wamapoke curse subplot [...] "wildly politically incorrect, but funny". National Post writer Scott Stinson said Parks and Recreation [...] "continues to challenge for the title of best comedy on television", and called the continuing romance between April and Andy a [...] "welcome development" [...] for both characters.|$|E
500|$|Sigourney Weaver has {{expressed}} interest in reuniting with Ridley Scott to revive her character for another Alien film. In the 2003 commentary track for the Alien DVD included in the Alien Quadrilogy set, she and Scott both speculated on the possibility, with Weaver stating: [...] "There is an appetite for a fifth one, which is something I never expected...it's really hard {{to come up with}} a fifth story that's new and fresh...but I have wanted to go back into space...I think outer space adventure is a good thing for us right now, 'cause Earth is so grim...so we've been talking about it, but very generally." [...] Scott remarked that, if the series were to continue, the most logical course would be to explore the origins of the space jockey and the Aliens. Weaver supported this idea, saying [...] "I think it would be great to go back, because I'm asked that question so many times: 'Where did the Alien come from?' People really want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> a very visceral way." [...] David Giler said that he, Walter Hill, and Gordon Carroll, the producers of the first four films in the series, would not be willing to produce another unless it was about the Aliens' homeworld and Weaver was on board (despite the fact that they were among the producers of Alien vs. Predator films). Weaver, in turn, indicated that she would only return to the franchise if either Scott or James Cameron were to direct. Cameron had been working on a story for a fifth Alien film which would explore the origins of the creatures, but ceased work on it when he learned that Fox was pursuing Alien vs. Predator, which he felt would [...] "kill the validity of the franchise".|$|E
