5|$|In {{the long}} term, the {{greatest}} {{changes in the}} Solar System will come from changes in the Sun itself as it ages. As the Sun burns through its supply of hydrogen fuel, it gets hotter and burns the remaining fuel even faster. As a result, the Sun is growing brighter {{at a rate of}} ten percent every 1.1billion years. In one billion years' time, as the Sun's radiation output increases, its circumstellar habitable zone will move outwards, making the Earth's surface <b>too</b> <b>hot</b> <b>for</b> liquid water to exist there naturally. At this point, all life on land will become extinct. Evaporation of water, a potent greenhouse gas, from the oceans' surface could accelerate temperature increase, potentially ending all life on Earth even sooner. During this time, it is possible that as Mars's surface temperature gradually rises, carbon dioxide and water currently frozen under the surface regolith will release into the atmosphere, creating a greenhouse effect that will heat the planet until it achieves conditions parallel to Earth today, providing a potential future abode for life. By 3.5billion years from now, Earth's surface conditions will be similar to those of Venus today.|$|E

25|$|Generally, lower-quality green teas are steeped hotter {{and longer}} while higher-quality teas are steeped cooler and shorter, but usually for {{multiple}} times (2-3 typically). Steeping <b>too</b> <b>hot</b> or <b>for</b> <b>too</b> long {{results in the}} release of excessive amounts of tannins, leading to a bitter, astringent brew, regardless of initial quality. The brew’s taste is also affected by the steeping technique. Two important techniques are to warm the steeping container beforehand to prevent the tea from immediately cooling down and to leave the tea leaf in the pot and gradually add more hot water as you drink the tea.|$|R

25|$|Planetesimals at a {{distance}} of 1astronomical unit (AU), the distance of the Earth from the Sun, probably did not contribute any water to the Earth because the solar nebula was <b>too</b> <b>hot</b> <b>for</b> ice to form and the hydration of rocks by water vapor would have taken too long. The water must have been supplied by meteorites from the outer asteroid belt and some large planetary embryos from beyond 2.5AU. Comets may also have contributed. Though most comets are today in orbits farther away from the Sun than Neptune, computer simulations show that they were originally far more common in the inner parts of the solar system.|$|E

25|$|Renewable energy {{resources}} and significant opportunities for energy efficiency exist over wide geographical areas, {{in contrast to}} other energy sources, which are concentrated in {{a limited number of}} countries. Rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency, and technological diversification of energy sources, would result in significant energy security and economic benefits. It would also reduce environmental pollution such as air pollution caused by burning of fossil fuels and improve public health, reduce premature mortalities due to pollution and save associated health costs that amount to several hundred billion dollars annually only in the United States. Renewable energy sources, that derive their energy from the sun, either directly or indirectly, such as hydro and wind, are expected to be capable of supplying humanity energy for almost another 1 billion years, at which point the predicted increase in heat from the sun is expected to make {{the surface of the earth}} <b>too</b> <b>hot</b> <b>for</b> liquid water to exist.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} after Apollo, the binary {{accretion}} model was settled on as the best hypothesis for explaining the Moon's origins, {{even though it was}} known to be flawed. Then, at a conference in Kona, Hawaii in 1984, a compromise model was composed that accounted for all of the observed discrepancies. Originally formulated by two independent research groups in 1976, the giant impact model supposed that a massive planetary object, the size of Mars, had collided with Earth early in its history. The impact would have melted Earth's crust, and the other planet's heavy core would have sunk inward and merged with Earth's. The superheated vapour produced by the impact would have risen into orbit around the planet, coalescing into the Moon. This explained the lack of water (the vapour cloud was <b>too</b> <b>hot</b> <b>for</b> water to condense), the similarity in composition (since the Moon had formed from part of the Earth), the lower density (since the Moon had formed from the Earth's crust and mantle, rather than its core), and the Moon's unusual orbit (since an oblique strike would have imparted a massive amount of angular momentum to the Earth–Moon system).|$|E

50|$|Scarification {{produces}} {{harm and}} {{trauma to the}} skin; thus it {{is considered to be}} unsafe by many. Infection is a concern. Not only do the materials for inducing the wounds need to be sanitary, but the wound needs to be kept clean, using antibacterial solutions or soaps often, and having good hygiene in general. It is not uncommon, especially if the wound is being irritated, for a local infection to develop around the wound. The scarification worker needs to have detailed knowledge of the anatomy of human skin, in order to prevent tools from cutting too deep, burning <b>too</b> <b>hot,</b> or burning <b>for</b> <b>too</b> long. Scarification is not nearly as popular as tattooing, so it is harder to find workers experienced in scarification. Precautions are typically taken during brandings, such as wearing masks and other personal protective equipment, because it is possible for diseases to be transmitted through the air, from the skin when the skin is burning.|$|R
