40|$|Background: It is {{theorized that}} the {{development}} of the ability to stabilize the trunk may improve the performance of a judoka because it improves body balance control and optimizes force transmission from the lower extremities to the upper limbs. However, {{there is a lack of}} scientific evidence to establish a clear relationship between trunk stability and performance in judo. Aim: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the quantification of trunk stability and muscular strength and endurance allowed differentiation between national level (n = 7) and international level judoka (n = 6). In addition, the relationship between trunk stability and muscular strength and endurance of the muscles involved in trunk stability control was analyzed. Method: To assess trunk stability, trunk responses to sudden loads applied by a pneumatic mechanism were analyzed, as well as trunk postural control through an unstable sitting paradigm. Muscular strength and endurance were assessed via a flexion and extension <b>trunk</b> <b>test</b> using an isokinetic dynamometer. Results/Conclusions: International level judokas showed lower CoP displacement in the most complex task in unstable seat (7. 00 ± 1. 19 vs 8. 93 ± 1. 45 mm, T =. 025) and higher absolute and relative peak torque in extensor muscles (7. 05 ± 0. 87 vs 5. 74 ± 0. 72 Nm, T =. 013) than national level judoka. According to these results, core stability and trunk muscular condition are important qualities in the physical training of elite judoka. Correlational analysis found no relation between the analyzed variables, thus muscular strength and endurance appear to have a non-significant effect on performance in the trunk stability tests. </p...|$|E

A total of 60 national (elite) team judo athletes, 40 men and 20 women (Age: 17 ± 3 years; Height: 169 ± 8. 4 cm; Body weight: 67. 7 ± 16. 5 kg; Body mass index: 23. 4 ± 4 kg/m²), who came to Turkey Olympic Athletic Educated Center between 1 January- 15 March 2017, their verbal approvals were taken and were suited in the inclusion criteria, were included in the study. The endurance of the core muscles of the athletes was evaluated statically and dynamically. Static endurance of the core muscles was evaluated with <b>trunk</b> flexion <b>test,</b> <b>trunk</b> extension <b>test,</b> right and left lateral bridge tests. Tests were terminated when the test position was deteriorated or the person said that he could not continue the test and the time was recorded. Dynamic endurance of the core muscles was evaluated with sit-ups test, modified push-ups test, right and left lateral flexion-repeat tests. It was noted how many times the athletes could perform each test for 60 seconds. When the relationship between the static and dynamic endurance of the core muscles of national team judo athletes was examined; <b>trunk</b> flexion <b>test</b> was only associated with the sit-ups test, all other static core endurance tests were associated with dynamic core endurance tests (r= 0. 260 / 0. 500, p< 0. 05).

Because of the relationship between the <b>trunk</b> flexion test/sit-ups <b>test,</b> <b>trunk</b> extension test/modified push-ups test, right lateral bridge test/right lateral flexion-repeat test and left lateral bridge test/left lateral flexion-repeat test, we think that these tests can be used interchangeably.

The four core endurance <b>tests</b> were the <b>trunk</b> flexor <b>test,</b> <b>trunk</b> extensor <b>test,</b> and bilateral side bridge tests. Flexibility tests included the sit-and-reach test and active range of the trunk and hip joint motions. Proprioception via passive reposition tests of the hips and a single limb balance test on an unsteady platform were used to evaluate core motor control. Functional measurements consisted of a squat test and a single leg hop test for time and distance.

Trunk function was measured with a computerized isoinertial dynamometric <b>trunk</b> <b>testing</b> device (Isostation B 200). Isometric and dynamic torques, range of motion and movement velocities were measured before treatment and after 14 days.

Participants were nine elementary PE teachers and 1, 201 fourth- and fifth-grade students who were enrolled in nine elementary schools. The students’ physical fitness were assessed using four FITNESSGRAM tests. The PE teachers’ levels of QPET were assessed using the Assessing Quality Teaching Rubrics (AQTR). The AQTR consisted of four essential dimensions including Task Design, Task Presentation, Class Management, and Instructional Guidance. Codes were confirmed through inter-rater reliability (82. 4 % and 84. 5 %). Data were analyzed through descriptive statistics, multiple R-squared regression models, and independent sample t-tests. The four essential teaching dimensions of QPET were significantly associated with the students’ cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength and endurance, and flexibility.

40|$|Background and Purpose. Muscle {{endurance}} is {{an important}} variable to measure {{in the assessment of}} back muscle function. This study investigated the electromyographic (EMG) activity and fatigue patterns of iliocostalis lumborum and multifidus muscles during a <b>trunk</b> holding <b>test.</b> Subjects. Sixteen male subjects (mean age = 24. 2 years, SD = 4. 2, range = 20. 6 - 31. 9) without low back pain or known pathology were recruited in the study. Methods. Surface EMG electrodes were used to record the activity of iliocostalis lumborum and mutifidus muscles during a 60 -second isometric contraction. To reflect the activity level and fatigue rate of the muscles, EMG amplitude (root mean square [RMS] values) and a frequency variable (median frequency [MF]) were measured. Results. The multifidus muscle displayed a higher level of activity, initial MF, and normalized MF slope than did the iliocostalis lumborum muscle. There was no difference, however, in the normalized RMS slope between the two muscles. The correlations between the normalized MF slope and the RMS slope of the two muscles were nonsignificant. Conclusion and Discussion. This study shows that monitoring frequency changes of the EMG signals may enable therapists to quantify the fatigue changes of individual muscles during the <b>trunk</b> holding <b>test.</b> The higher fatigue rate shown in the multifidus muscle compared with the iliocostalis lumborum muscle {{may be due to the}} higher activity level of the multifidus muscle during the trunk holding contraction.

The recommended periods vary from 2 days to 2 weeks. The duration of optimum length is an important topic given the economical and physiological drawbacks of prolonged inactivity. The purpose of this work is to measure objectively the efficacy of two different durations of bed rest through a dynamometric measure of trunk function. Some 51 male patients, students or self-employed, being treated for acute low back pain were randomized into two groups. Group I was prescribed a bed rest period of 3 days and group II, a period of 7 days. We used a multi-axis isoinertial <b>trunk</b> <b>testing</b> dynamometric device (Isostation B 200, Isotechnologies, USA). Patients were all assessed on day 1 and also on day 5 for group I or on day 9 for group II.

Patients {{were also asked to}} fill in a visual analogue pain scale on both assessment days. The improvement of all performance measures were important and highly significant (P < 0. 001) in both groups.

Eccentric, isometric, and concentric peak torque of the trunk flexor and extensor muscles was measured in 15 healthy subjects. Muscle cross sectional area (CSA) and surface electromyographic (EMG) activity were respectively correlated to peak torque and submaximal isometric torque for erector spinae and rectus abdominis muscles. Reliability of peak torque measurements was determined during test and retest sessions. Significant correlations were consistently observed between muscle CSA and peak torque for all contraction types (r = 0. 74 À 0. 85; P < 0. 001) and between EMG activity and submaximal isometric torque (r P 0. 99; P < 0. 05), for both extensor and flexor muscles.
