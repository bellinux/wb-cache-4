6000|$|In {{order to}} {{eliminate}} the reference to our perceptions, which introduces an irrelevant psychological suggestion, I will take a different illustration, namely, stellar photography. A photographic plate exposed on a clear night reproduces {{the appearance of the}} portion of the sky concerned, with more or fewer stars according {{to the power of the}} telescope that is being used. Each separate star which is photographed produces its separate effect on the plate, just as it would upon ourselves if we were looking at the sky. If we assume, as science normally does, the continuity of physical processes, we are forced to conclude that, at the place where the plate is, and at all places between it and a star which it photographs, SOMETHING is happening which is specially connected with that star. In the days when the aether was less in doubt, we should have said that what was happening was a certain kind of <b>transverse</b> <b>vibration</b> in the aether. But it is not necessary or desirable to be so explicit: all that we need say is that SOMETHING happens which is specially connected with the star in question. It must be something specially connected with that star, since that star produces its own special effect upon the plate. Whatever it is must be the end of a process which starts from the star and radiates outwards, partly on general grounds of continuity, partly to account for the fact that light is transmitted with a certain definite velocity. We thus arrive at the conclusion that, if a certain star is visible at a certain place, or could be photographed by a sufficiently sensitive plate at that place, something is happening there which is specially connected with that star. Therefore in every place at all times a vast multitude of things must be happening, namely, at least one for every physical object which can be seen or photographed from that place. We can classify such happenings on either of two principles: ...|$|E

A special stress distribution with the constant radial stress condition is proposed. Functionally graded material behavior is achieved by radially varying the degree of orthotropy (Jain, Ramachandra and Simha (1999).

40|$|Vortex-induced {{vibrations}} of a pivoted {{circular cylinder}} {{and control of}} these vibrations were investigated experimentally. A novel experimental setup was employed to reproduce orbiting response observed in some engineering applications. An adaptive pendulum tuned-mass damper (TMD) was integrated with the cylindrical structure {{in order to control}} the vortex-induced vibrations. All experiments were performed at a constant Reynolds number of 2100 for a range of reduced velocities from 3. 4 to 11. 3 and damping ratios from 0. 004 to 0. 018. For the experiments involving TMD, the TMD mass ratio was 0. 087 and the TMD damping ratios investigated were 0 and 0. 24. The results of the experiments performed without the TMD show that, in the synchronization region, the frequencies of <b>transverse</b> and streamwise <b>vibrations</b> lock onto the natural frequency of the structure. The cylinder is observed to trace elliptic trajectories. A mathematical model is introduced to investigate the mechanism responsible for the occurrence of the observed elliptic trajectories and figure- 8 type trajectories reported in previous laboratory investigations. The results show that the occurrence of either elliptic trajectories or figure- 8 type trajectories is governed primarily by structural coupling between vibrations in streamwise and transverse directions. Four types of elliptic trajectories were identified. The results show that the occurrence of the different types of elliptic trajectories is linked to phase angle between the streamwise and <b>transverse</b> <b>vibrations</b> of the structure, which depends on structural coupling. The results of the experiments performed to investigate effectiveness of the TMD in controlling vortex-induced vibrations show that tuning the TMD natural frequency to the natural frequency of the structure decreases significantly the amplitudes of <b>transverse</b> and streamwise <b>vibrations</b> of the structure. Specifically, the <b>transverse</b> amplitudes of <b>vibrations</b> are decreased by a factor of ten and streamwise amplitudes of vibrations are decreased by a factor of three. The results show that, depending on the value of the TMD damping ratio, the frequency of <b>transverse</b> <b>vibrations</b> is either characterized by the natural frequency or by two frequencies: one higher and the other lower than the natural frequency of the structure, referred to as fundamental frequencies. Independent of TMD damping and tuning frequency ratios, the frequency of streamwise vibrations matches that of the <b>transverse</b> <b>vibrations</b> in the synchronization region, and the cylinder traces elliptic trajectories. The phase angle between the streamwise and <b>transverse</b> <b>vibrations</b> is nearly constant when the pendulum is restrained. However, with the TMD engaged and tuned to the natural frequency, the phase angle fluctuates significantly with time. A mathematical model was utilized to gain insight into the frequency response of the structure. The results of the modeling show that the frequency of <b>transverse</b> <b>vibrations</b> is characterized by the fundamental frequency or frequencies of the structure and the frequency of streamwise vibrations is characterized by the fundamental frequency or frequencies as well as the first harmonic of the fundamental frequency or frequencies of the structure...|$|R
