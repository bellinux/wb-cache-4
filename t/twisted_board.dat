60|$|All {{day long}} a careful watch was kept among the {{branches}} of the mighty ceiba-tree. And what a tree that was! The hugest English oak would have seemed a stunted bush beside it. Borne up on roots, or rather walls, of <b>twisted</b> <b>board,</b> some twelve feet high, between which the whole crew, their ammunitions, and provisions, were housed roomily, rose the enormous trunk full forty feet in girth, towering like some tall lighthouse, smooth for a hundred feet, then crowned with boughs, each of which was a stately tree, whose topmost twigs were full two hundred and fifty feet from the ground. And yet it was easy for the sailors to ascend; so many natural ropes had kind Nature lowered for their use, in the smooth lianes which hung to the very earth, often without a knot or leaf. Once in the tree, you were within a new world, suspended between heaven and earth, and as Cary said, no wonder if, like Jack when he climbed the magic bean-stalk, you had found a castle, a giant, and a few acres of well-stocked park, packed away somewhere amid that labyrinth of timber. Flower-gardens at least were there in plenty; for every limb was covered with pendent cactuses, gorgeous orchises, and wild pines; and while one-half the tree was clothed in rich foliage, the other half, utterly leafless, bore on every twig brilliant yellow flowers, around which humming-birds whirred all day long. Parrots peeped in and out of every cranny, while, within the airy woodland, brilliant lizards basked like living gems upon the bark, gaudy finches flitted and chirruped, butterflies of every size and color hovered over the topmost twigs, innumerable insects hummed from morn till eve; and when the sun went down, tree-toads came out to snore and croak till dawn. There was more life round that one tree than in a whole square mile of English soil.|$|E

40|$|Shape stability, {{the ability}} of the wood to retain its shape, {{is one of the most}} {{important}} parameters when using timber as a building material and for other applications. Generally, timber undergoes changes in dimensions and shape when its moisture content is changed. However, this can often not be tolerated in constructions and thus, methods to improve the shape stability have to be found. In this thesis, the influence of high-temperature drying on the immediate shape stability after drying but also on the long-term behaviour under in-service conditions was studied for Norway spruce and different larch species. Special focus was on twist, as this is the predominant distortion type leading to downgrading of Scandinavian timber species. Small-scale specimens were dried at high temperatures (120 ?C and 170 ?C) and compared to conventional drying (80 ?C). All drying schedules, independent of temperature, included pre-steaming and steaming phases at saturated conditions (98 ?C, 98 % relative humidity). The effect of restrained drying or top-loading was investigated by restraining half of the boards during the drying process. After completed drying, all specimens were moisture-cycled to investigate the permanency of shape stability and distortion reduction attained during restrained drying. The influence of drying temperatures on shape stability of spruce was also compared to commercial heat-treatment. The results showed that high-temperature drying is an alternative for Scandinavian timber species such as Norway spruce and larch. Distortions, especially twist, were successfully reduced by restrained drying and the obtained shape stability was permanent, even in changing humidity conditions. Drying temperature did not influence shape stability, but similar results were found for shape stability for drying at temperatures levels 80, 120 and 170 ?C. The good shape stability for low-temperature drying (80 ?C) is most probably achieved by the pre-steaming and steaming phases, which constituted a short high-temperature treatment with corresponding softening and creep behaviour. Excessively <b>twisted</b> <b>boards</b> were heat-treated at 95 ?C to investigate the possibility to reduce twist. Twist could be effectively reduced by heat-treatment, however, twist increased slightly in subsequent moisture cycling. These results confirm earlier studies in that excessively <b>twisted</b> <b>boards</b> can be straightened by heat-treatment, as mechano-thermal creep helps to attain the desired shape of the board. High-temperature drying influences both the chemical and physical properties of timber. In this study, sorption behaviour, stiffness (static and dynamic modulus of elasticity in bending), bending strength and toughness were investigated. It could be shown that stiffness is more or less unaffected by drying temperature, whereas bending stress decreases with increasing drying temperature. The toughness tests did not show a clear tendency of strength loss with increasing temperature. Finally, the effect of different drying temperatures and heat-treatment on the susceptibility for mould growth was studied. It could be stated that all kiln drying temperatures resulted in about equal mould growth levels, whereas air-drying had lower and heat-treatment substantially lower mould levels. Other factors influencing the amount of mould growth were presence of sapwood or heartwood and the type of surface ? original drying surface or re-sawn surface...|$|R

40|$|Poor shape {{stability}} of sawn softwood timber, causes substantial economic losses for sawmills {{and the building}} industry. Sawn timber twist is regarded {{to be the most}} severe deformation and {{has been shown to be}} controlled by intrinsic wood properties like wood shrinkage and spiral grain angle. The aim of the studies this thesis is based upon was to investigate the possibility to improve sawn timber shape stability, by genetic selection of genotypes of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) with a favourable spiral grain angle. Genetic parameters were estimated for the spiral grain angle in the mature wood of trees in four progeny trials (age 27 – 36 years) and two clonal trials (age 19 years) of Norway spruce. In addition, in a 36 -year-old Scots pine progeny trial, the grain angle was measured and shape stability traits of the boards sawn from sampled trees were assessed. The estimates of genetic standard deviation (0. 7 °– 0. 9 °) and heritability (0. 29 – 0. 42) in the mature wood of both species suggested that grain angle could be altered by genetic selection. The grain angle measured in single annual rings of Scots pine showed substantial phenotypic correlations (0. 54 – 0. 70) with the twist of small sawn timber dried to a 12 % moisture content. As an example, twist could potentially be reduced by 0. 3 °– 0. 7 ° by selecting 20 % of the parents displaying the lowest grain angle, thereby appreciably decreasing the percentage of excessively <b>twisted</b> <b>boards.</b> Grain angle under bark exhibited non-significant genetic correlations, close to zero, with growth traits, stem form, and branch traits in both species, and with pilodyn penetration in Norway spruce, suggesting that genetic selection for this trait would not generate any appreciable response in the other traits. The results of the studies imply that the grain angle measured under bark is utilisable in terms of genetic parameter estimation and for predicting the twist propensity of small sawn timber. This suggests that there is potential to improve sawn timber shape stability by genetic selection for a lower grain angle under bark and thus reducing the twist of sawn timber...|$|R
5000|$|A rider or [...] "caster boarder" [...] gains speed {{because each}} wheel {{is mounted on}} a 30° slant {{on the bottom of}} each deck.

The weight pushing the board back down causes the wheels to turn to face straight again.

40|$|This thesis deals {{mainly with}} {{computer}} simulations of wood-drying distortions, especially twist. The {{reason for this}} is that such distortions often appear in dried timber, and the results are quality downgrades and thus value losses in the wood value chain. A computer simulation is a way to theoretically simulate what happens in reality when moisture content in timber changes. If the computer simulation model is appropriate and capable of realistic simulations of real events, then it is possible to study what happens with the timber distortions if some parameters in the simulation model are changed. In that way, a good simulation model is a good tool to use when trying to reduce wood-drying distortions by altering some parameters in the process of producing timber. Computer simulations have the comparative advantage over real-world experiments of being cheaper and faster to perform, but the disadvantage that the outcome may be doubtful if the simulation model is bad. Wood is an anisotropic material that is often modelled as an orthotropic material, i. e., a material that has three orthogonal directions at each point with different material properties. A method to measure the orthotropic directions in wood nondestructively was the subject of paper 1. The method was to calculate the directions from the information in a series of two-dimensional computed tomography (CT) images. Fictitious, small calculation spheres were distributed in the wood material, and the principal directions of inertia of these spheres were calculated using the density information in the CT images. The principal directions were assumed to be the radial, the tangential and the fibre direction at the point in question. Tests of the method on three wood samples showed that the method works, but that there was considerable spread in the results from individual spheres. The spread was reduced by calculating mean values for a number of spheres in the vicinity of each other. Twist of timber depends on various influencing variables. Traditionally, a formula from the late 50 s by Stevens and Johnston, valid for single growth ring cylinders, has often been used to explain which variables influence twist. One interesting influencing variable in this formula is the spiral grain angle; the others are the moisture content change, the coefficient of moisture expansion and the radius of the growth ring cylinder in question. However, real boards are not single growth ring cylinders, and paper 2 deals with the dependence of <b>twist</b> of realistic <b>boards</b> on various influencing variables. Derivations were made on a theoretical and analytical level of the twist of timber, and the result was a formula whose first term corresponds to Stevens and Johnston's original formula; but the formula has also a second term. This second term is proportional to the gradient of the spiral grain angle and is especially important for timber sawn far from pith. The validity of the second term was shown by comparisons with finite element method (FEM) results and also with experimental results. The first step in simulating wood-drying distortions is to simulate the wood-drying process. The output of this moisture transport simulation is the moisture content of the wood piece as a function of time. We then use this output as input to a second step in which we simulate the shrinkage and deformation of the wood piece. A diffusion model was used here to simulate moisture transport, and this simulation requires diffusion and mass transfer coefficients. Such values from drying Norway spruce (Picea abies) sapwood were measured and reported in paper 3. Measurements of the moisture content during drying of a sample were made with CT, and the diffusion coefficient was evaluated with two methods. The first method used a one-dimensional and the second a two-dimensional diffusion model. No assumptions of the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on any functions or variables were made beforehand. Both methods showed about the same result and dependence on moisture content, but also on depth (distance from surface) of the diffusion coefficient. The depth dependence was only apparent near the surface. Comparisons of the evaluated values of the diffusion coefficient in general terms with other results were made and showed agreement. Industrial process changes aimed at reducing twist distortions are interesting to study. In paper 4, simulations of drying distortions were conducted, and pretwist during drying as a remedy to overcome <b>twist</b> of <b>boards</b> was tried. Paper 4 also contained results from laboratory experiments on the influence of the spiral grain angle and the degree of restraint and pretwist during drying on <b>twist</b> of <b>boards.</b> Results from an industrial test of the influence of the spiral grain angle and the degree of restraint on <b>twist</b> of <b>boards</b> were also described. The laboratory experiments and the industrial test were simulated with an FEM simulation model in two stages. First, the FEM model was calibrated by adjusting the yield stresses of the wood material in order for the results from the laboratory experiments to agree with the simulation model results. Then in a second stage, the simulation model was used to simulate the industrial test. The results showed that the FEM simulation model was capable of producing realistic results, but that there were some discrepancies between the industrial test results and the simulation results. The discrepancies were assumed to be due to biased measurements, insufficient knowledge of the distribution of the spiral grain angle or other causes. Godkänd; 2006; 20061206 (pafi...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of twist in Norway spruce boards (Karst.) during normal temperature kiln drying was researched. Tangentially oriented boards were sawn from diametrical radial planks, {{from which the}} basic wood properties, i. e. linear shrinkage and grain angle, were determined. The unrestrained boards were kiln dried using a selected drying schedule. During the controlled drying process the moisture content (MC) and <b>twist</b> of the <b>boards</b> were measured. <b>Twist</b> was generally induced by the shrinkage of wood below the fibre saturation point, and increased in proportional to the decrease in MC. The earlier appearance of twist, with regard to MC and drying time, was confirmed {{in the case of}} boards sawn from the central part of logs. The final twist amounted to between 10 and 20 °/m in the case of boards close to the pith, and decreased to less than 4 °/m in the case of boards sawn at a radius of 70  mm from the centre of the logs. Ring curvature had the highest impact on the final twist of the dried boards, followed by grain angle and tangential shrinkage...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [40]- 41) The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the mechanical variables of a handspring vault and a Yamashita vault with a half twist, and identify differences that may be significant when progressing from one vault to the other. A total of 48 subjects was utilized for the comparison, with 24 subjects performing a handspring vault at the 1987 Pan American Games and 24 subjects performing a Yamashita vault with a half twist at the 1992 Summer Olympic Games. A total of 36 different variables was analyzed in the comparison. The study identified differences (ps. 001) in body orientation angles, vertical velocity, and angular momentum to be important variables to concentrate on when progressing from a handspring vault to a Yamashita vault with a half twist. The gymnasts who performed the Yamashita vault with a half <b>twist</b> departed the <b>board</b> in a more forward body position with a higher vertical velocity. They also contacted and departed the horse with a higher vertical velocity, attributing to a greater time and CG trajectory height of postflight. The gymnasts performing the Yamashita vault with a half twist also exhibited a smaller angular momentum at board departure than the gymnasts performing the handspring vault, with both groups reducing their angular momentum while on horse. It may be important to focus on body orientation angles, vertical velocity, and angular momentum when progressing from a handspring vault to a Yamashita vault with a half twist. M. S. Ed.

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} wood {{instability}} have identified some wood basic properties which influence the timber distortion and shape changes while the wood is losing or gaining moisture. These properties include wood anisotropic shrinkage, {{equilibrium moisture content}} (EMC) in both desorption and adsorption, fibre saturation point (FSP) and water diffusion coefficient. This study investigated the stability related wood properties and their variations within the stems of the New Zealand grown radiata pine trees. The basic density, EMC and shrinkage for the earlywood and the latewood were also experimentally determined. In taking into account these properties and their variations, an analytical model was developed to simulate the wood distortion. The equilibrium moisture content was determined at 30 Â°C and humidity range from 27 % to 90 %. It {{was found that the}} EMC difference between the earlywood and the latewood was negligible. The experimental results also show that the EMC decreases from pith towards the bark over the disc cross section and the trend is most obvious at high humidities (70 - 90 %). Along the tree height, the EMC decreases from ground towards the top of the stem. The tangential shrinkage results were highly variable but, in general, the latewood has higher values than the earlywood. The opposite trend was found for the longitudinal shrinkage, higher values for the earlywood than the latewood. In the tree height direction, the tangential shrinkage was found to decrease with the tree height. This follows the same trend as the microfibril angle which in general also decreases with the tree height. The fibre saturation point (FSP) was determined from the tangential shrinkage values at different equilibrium moisture contents. These were taken as the intersection point of the tangential shrinkage line with the moisture content axis. The experimental results have revealed a trend that the FSP decreases from the pith towards the bark and also decreases with the tree height. Similar behaviour was found for the tangential and longitudinal swelling during the adsorption. The moisture transport within radiata pine was investigated based on the diffusion theory under transient and isothermal condition of 30 Â°C. The moisture dependant diffusion coefficient was derived from the experimental data using the inverse analysis method. The surface emission coefficient was determined by taking into account the variable surface moisture content, wood density and the ambient conditions. In the experiments, 138 samples in total (46 samples for each XIV of the longitudinal, tangential and radial directions) were used and their diffusion coefficients were determined for both the adsorption and the desorption with moisture content ranging from 6 % to 22 %. The derived diffusion coefficients are comparable with the reported data in the literature. Further investigation of the wood type influence on the diffusion coefficient revealed that compression wood has the lowest diffusion coefficients in the three directions (longitudinal, tangential and radial) both in the desorption and in the adsorption. In addition, the moisture content has the least influence on the diffusion coefficient in the compression wood. Investigation on the effects of the wood density has shown that in general, the diffusion coefficient decreases with increasing wood density although the correlations are only significant for the longitudinal direction in desorption. An analytical model for the simulation of the wood twist was developed which is based on the geometry and geometrical changes of the grains aligning non parallel to the pith. A board consists of numerous such grains which change the length and shape with moisture content change. The model predictions confirm that the grain angle, the tangential and longitudinal shrinkage and the conical angle all affect the development of the <b>board</b> <b>twist.</b> However, the discrepancies between the model prediction and the experimental data are significant, partly due to the experimental uncertainties and partly due to the model errors. In this study, sound velocity in the longitudinal direction was measured for the test samples used in the shrinkage experiments. The results revealed that the correlations between the sound velocity and the volumetric shrinkage at oven dry are significant. Based on this finding, the relationship between the tangential shrinkage and the radial shrinkage, the tangential shrinkage can be predicted from the sound velocity measurements. As the tangential shrinkage has significant influence on the wood distortion, this method can be used to segregate logs which may be prone to wood distortion...|$|R
