5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Jumping Flash! 2 {{is virtually}} identical to its predecessor; {{the game is}} presented in a first-person perspective, and the player can move freely in three-dimensional world and rotate the camera in any direction. The user interface resembles much {{of the characteristics of}} its predecessor; the <b>top</b> <b>part</b> of the screen shows the time remaining, the player's score, and one of four of Robbit's AI sidekicks who offers the player warnings, reminders and hints.|$|E
5|$|Though child-sized bikinis {{appeared}} in the 1950s, in many European countries, swimsuits under size 11 are commonly not sold with a <b>top</b> <b>part,</b> but in the United States, Britain, and Canada, {{it has often been}} considered unacceptable for girls in late childhood (ages 7–11) to go topless. Several incidents of families being evicted from public pools due to their child being topless have been reported. In 2002, clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch came under criticism for selling child-sized thong bikinis and underwear.|$|E
5|$|Jumping Flash! is {{presented}} in a first-person perspective. The player assumes the role of Robbit, a robotic rabbit, and can freely move Robbit in three-dimensional space and can rotate the camera in any direction. The <b>top</b> <b>part</b> of the screen shows the remaining time, the player's score, and a character named Kumagoro—Robbit's sidekick artificial intelligence who offers the player warnings and hints. The top left corner of the screen shows the collected power-ups; the top right corner contains the radar showing the locations of objects including enemies, power-ups, jet pods and enemy projectiles. The bottom shows a health meter on the sides {{and the number of}} remaining lives in the centre. The player starts the game with three lives; a new life is granted once one million points are earned.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} found {{holistic}} processing to be a marker of expertise for perception of words in alphabetic (e. g., English) and non-alphabetic (e. g., Chinese) writing systems, consistent with what has been found for faces and other objects of face-like expertise. It is unknown, however, whether holistic processing of words occurs in an early, perceptual stage as it does for faces. We examined how early holistic processing of Chinese characters emerges by recording the event-related potentials (ERPs) in an adaptation paradigm. Participants judged if the <b>top</b> <b>parts</b> of two sequentially presented characters were the same or different while ignoring the bottom part. An early potential (P 1) at the posterior channels was smaller when the attended <b>top</b> <b>parts</b> were the same compared with when they are different, indicating an adaptation effect. Critically, for trials with identical <b>top</b> <b>parts,</b> P 1 was larger when the irrelevant bottom parts were different, indicating a release of adaptation. This effect was present only when the two character parts were aligned but not misaligned, and only for characters but not for pseudocharacters. The finding of early sensitivity to all parts of a Chinese character suggests that Chinese characters are represented holistically at a perceptual level...|$|R
