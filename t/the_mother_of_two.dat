5|$|Hugh {{was known}} for his extravagant tastes and opulent lifestyle, as well as his {{possession}} of a large library. He had a son, Henry, {{who was one of the}} hostages demanded by Longchamp in 1190. Another son was Hugh, who became chancellor for King Philip II of France. Both Henry and Hugh were the sons of the bishop's long term mistress, Alice de Percy. Alice may have been <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> more of the bishop's sons, William, archdeacon of Northumberland, and Burchard, archdeacon of Durham and treasurer of York. He had a number of other mistresses but Alice was the most public, so much so that it caused a scandal, and closely resembled a marriage.|$|E
5|$|The 10th Earl of Shaftesbury {{became a}} {{familiar}} figure {{in some of the}} nightspots on the French Riviera. He was known for his black leather trousers, pink shirts, and large red and black eyeglasses. He had a habit of flashing his money around as he bought drinks {{for a wide variety of}} female companions. At one such establishment on the Riviera, he met Jamila Ben M'Barek (born c. 1961), a divorcée and <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> children from a previous relationship. She was one of seven children born in Paris to a Tunisian mother and Moroccan father. In 1993, M'Barek had posed naked in Playboy, but it did not cause alarm. They were married on 5 November 2002, at Hilversum in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Reginald de Warenne was {{the third}} son of William de Warenne, the second Earl of Surrey, who died in 1138. Reginald's mother was Isabel de Vermandois. Reginald was likely born between 1121 and 1126. Reginald's {{brothers}} were William de Warenne, the third Earl of Surrey, and Ralph de Warenne. Reginald's two sisters were Gundrada de Warenne who married first Roger, Earl of Warwick and then William of Lancaster, and Ada de Warenne who married Henry, Earl of Huntingdon. Ada's husband was the only son of King David I of Scotland, and she was <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> kings of Scotland– Malcolm IV and William I. From their mother's first marriage to Robert de Beaumont, Reginald and his siblings were half-siblings of the twins Robert de Beaumont the Earl of Leicester and Waleran de Beaumont, the Count of Meulan and Earl of Worcester. There was another Reginald de Warenne alive during Reginald's lifetime– {{this may have been}} an illegitimate half-brother.|$|E

25|$|The {{prognosis}} for patients diagnosed with Timothy syndrome is very poor. Of 17 children analyzed in one study, 10 died {{at an average}} age of 2.5 years. Of those that did survive, 3 were diagnosed with autism, one with an autism spectrum disorder, and the last had severe delays in language development. One patient with atypical Timothy syndrome was largely normal with the exception of heart arrhythmia. Likewise, <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> Timothy syndrome patients also carried the mutation but lacked any obvious phenotype. In both of these cases, however, the lack of severity of the disorder was due to mosaicism.|$|E
25|$|The sources do not {{record the}} date of Ælfgifu's {{marriage}} to Edmund. The eldest son Eadwig, who had barely reached majority on his accession in 955, may have been born around 940, which gives us only a very rough terminus ante quem for the betrothal. Although as <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> future kings, Ælfgifu {{proved to be an}} important royal bed companion, there is no strictly contemporary evidence that she was ever consecrated as queen. In a charter of doubtful authenticity dated 942-946, she attests as the king's concubine (concubina regis). but later in the century Æthelweard the Chronicler styles her queen (regina).|$|E

25|$|Tahitian actress Tarita Teriipaia, {{who played}} Brando's love {{interest}} in Mutiny on the Bounty, became {{his third wife}} on August 10, 1962. She was 20 years old, 18 years younger than Brando, who was reportedly delighted by her naïveté. Because Teriipaia was a native French speaker, Brando became fluent in the language and gave numerous interviews in French. Teriipaia became <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> of his children: Simon Teihotu Brando (born 1963) and Tarita Cheyenne Brando (born 1970). Brando also adopted Teriipaia's daughter, Maimiti Brando (born 1977) and niece, Raiatua Brando (born 1982). Brando and Teriipaia divorced in July 1972.|$|E
25|$|A chimera is an {{ordinary}} person or animal except {{that some of}} their parts actually came from their twin or from the mother. A chimera may arise either from monozygotic twin fetuses (where {{it would be impossible to}} detect), or from dizygotic fetuses, which can be identified by chromosomal comparisons from various parts of the body. The number of cells derived from each fetus can vary from one part of the body to another, and often leads to characteristic mosaicism skin coloration in human chimeras. A chimera may be intersex, composed of cells from a male twin and a female twin. In one case DNA tests determined that a woman, mystifyingly, was not <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> of her three children; she was found to be a chimera, and the two children were conceived from eggs derived from cells of their mother's twin.|$|E

Shelby eventually arrives, and sets the place ablaze while Madison is still there. Madison may die in the blaze, or the player may manage to have her escape. If she escapes and has found Shaun's location, the player may have her phone and tell either Norman or Ethan it, or have her go there alone. If the player fails to find the address and/or dies, she will be removed from play for the final level where the killer is confronted.|$|E

Khalid Mohamed hailed Mukerji's performance as [...] "near flawless" [...] but Rajeev Masand thought that neither she nor Khan [...] "are able to make much of an impression because their characters are so unidimensional and boring." ...|$|E
500|$|Barney was {{notoriously}} non-monogamous, a {{fact that}} the other two women had to accept. Brooks met Barney in 1916, {{at a time when the}} writer had already been involved for about seven years with Duchess Elisabeth de Gramont, also known as Lily or Elisabeth de Clermont-Tonnerre. She was married and <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> daughters. After a brief dust-up that resulted in Barney's offering Gramont a marriage contract while at the same time refusing to give up Brooks, the three women formed a stable lifelong triangle in which none was a third wheel. Gramont, one of the most glamorous taste-makers and aristocrats of the period, summed up their values when she said, [...] "Civilized beings are those who know how to take more from life than others." [...] Gender fluidity and sexual freedom were paramount among women of Brooks' circle. [...] Barney hosted a literary salon on Paris's Left Bank.|$|E
500|$|The affair between Erskine and Mitford {{continued}} intermittently. While {{she often}} despaired of the relationship, she refused other offers of marriage, {{saying that she}} would [...] "never marry anyone except Hamish." [...] In 1932 her plight was overshadowed by a family scandal involving her younger sister Diana, who had married Bryan Guinness in 1928 and was <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> young sons. In 1932 Diana deserted her husband to become the mistress of Sir Oswald Mosley, {{the leader of the}} British Union of Fascists, himself married with three children. [...] Almost alone of her family, Mitford offered her sister support, regularly visiting her and keeping her up to date with [...] family news and social gossip. Her own love affair with Erskine came to an abrupt end when, in June 1933, he informed her that he intended to marry the daughter of a London banker. In a final letter after their parting, Mitford wrote to him: [...] "I thought in your soul you loved me & that in the end we should have children & look back on life together when we are old".|$|E
