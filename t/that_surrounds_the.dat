5|$|The Narayan Sarovar is a lake <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> <b>the</b> main monument. The lake {{contains}} holy waters from 151rivers {{and lakes}} that {{are believed to}} have been sanctified by Swaminarayan, including Mansarovar. Surrounding the Narayan Sarovar are 108gaumukhs, symbolising Janmangal Namavali or the 108names for god, from which holy water issues forth.|$|E
5|$|The areolar glands {{are in the}} areola <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> <b>the</b> nipple in {{the female}} breast. These glands secrete an oily fluid that lubricates the nipple, and also secrete {{volatile}} compounds that are thought {{to serve as an}} olfactory stimulus for the newborn. During pregnancy and lactation these glands, also called Montgomery's glands, become enlarged.|$|E
5|$|Discovery {{of active}} {{volcanic}} {{activity on the}} moon Io was probably the greatest surprise. It {{was the first time}} active volcanoes had been seen on another body in the Solar System. It appears that activity on Io affects the entire Jovian system. Io appears to be the primary source of matter that pervades the Jovian magnetosphere – the region of space <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> <b>the</b> planet influenced by the planet's strong magnetic field. Sulfur, oxygen, and sodium, apparently erupted by Io's volcanoes and sputtered off the surface by impact of high-energy particles, were detected at {{the outer edge of the}} magnetosphere of Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|Miniopterus zapfei can be {{identified}} as a Miniopterus {{on the basis of}} the possession of three lower premolars (designated p2, p3, and p4, because the original first premolar has been lost); a two-rooted p3; and the nyctalodont molars, with the posterolophid (a crest at the back of the molar) behind the entoconid cusp. M.zapfei is about 30% larger than M.fossilis and has a more slender p4. Compared to living Miniopterus, the cingulum (shelf) <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> <b>the</b> P4 is less well-developed and the parastyle crest is weaker.|$|E
5|$|People {{associated}} with the church include Henry Maurice (elected Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford {{shortly before his death}} in 1691; his father, Thomas, was the perpetual curate of the church) and the 19th-century writer and priest Owen Wynne Jones (who was the curate for a time in the early 1860s). The 19th-century Calvinistic Methodist preacher Richard Owen was born in the parish, and is buried in the graveyard <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> <b>the</b> church.|$|E

On a more tactical level, {{a host of other}} details can be influenced; Capello is even believed to have instructed the Wembley ball boys to return balls at speed when they go out of play.|$|E

5|$|The choir {{is where}} the priest and/or a choral group sings the psalms. It {{is located in the}} central nave between the main door and the high altar, and built in a semicircular fashion, much like Spanish cathedrals. It was built by Juan de Rojas between 1696 and 1697. Its sides contain 59reliefs of various saints done in mahogany, walnut, cedar and a native wood called tepehuaje. The railing <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> <b>the</b> choir was made in 1722 by Sangley Queaulo in Macao, China and placed in the cathedral in 1730.|$|E
5|$|Historian David Detzer {{has argued}} that the fame <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> <b>the</b> 11th New York is misplaced. During its time in service, the 11th New York Regiment saw little {{fighting}} compared to other well-known regiments such as the 69th New York, 20th Maine, and 28th Massachusetts. The 11th New York was often overshadowed by the 73rd New York, also known as the Second Fire Zouaves, which fought at Antietam, Gettysburg, and Appomattox. In addition, Ellsworth failed to consider that the New York City fire companies from which his troops were drawn often competed against each other at blazes. The cohesion he sought in firefighters did not exist and would not be created when they joined the regiment. In that respect, 11th New York was no different than many regiments, North and South.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} the show was that each main event match was to be contested as an Elimination Chamber match. The Elimination Chamber is a {{circular}} steel cage, consisting of chains and girders, <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> <b>the</b> ring. Four 'pods' are enclosed within the chamber, one behind each ring post, which are on a steel platform surrounding {{the outside of the}} ring. Six wrestlers compete in the match; four are enclosed within the pods and released at random at specific time intervals, and two start the match. Wrestlers can only be eliminated via pinfall or submission, and the last wrestler left is the winner. For the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, both WWE world championships, the WWE Championship and the World Heavyweight Championship, were to be defended in separate Elimination Chamber matches.|$|E

5|$|The {{simplest}} molluscan {{reproductive system}} relies on external fertilization, {{but with more}} complex variations. All produce eggs, from which may emerge trochophore larvae, more complex veliger larvae, or miniature adults. Two gonads sit next to the coelom, a small cavity <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> <b>the</b> heart, into which they shed ova or sperm. The nephridia extract the gametes from the coelom and emit them into the mantle cavity. Molluscs that use such a system remain of one sex all their lives and rely on external fertilization. Some molluscs use internal fertilization and/or are hermaphrodites, functioning as both sexes; both of these methods require more complex reproductive systems.|$|E
5|$|While not {{inside an}} {{infected}} cell {{or in the}} process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent particles. These viral particles, also known as virions, consist of two or three parts: (i) the genetic material made from either DNA or RNA, long molecules that carry genetic information; (ii) a protein coat, called the capsid, which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an envelope of lipids <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> <b>the</b> protein coat when they are outside a cell. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple helical and icosahedral forms for some virus species to more complex structures for others. Most virus species have virions that are too small to be seen with an optical microscope. The average virion is about one one-hundredth the size of the average bacterium.|$|E
5|$|After {{the player}} defeats the Elite Four {{and enters the}} Champion's chamber, he or she finds that N has {{defeated}} Alder and become the newest Pokémon Champion. Soon after, he summons a large castle <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> <b>the</b> Pokémon League, challenging the player to find him {{to take part in}} one final battle. When the player finally reaches him, Reshiram in Black or Zekrom in White appears before the player, and the player must capture the legendary Pokémon before challenging N. After his defeat, N laments the possibility that his ideals are mistaken, Ghetsis intrudes and angrily reveals that his true intentions were to use N to ensure that he would be the only human left with control over Pokémon and use them to rule the world. In his rage, Ghetsis challenges the player to battle. After Ghetsis's defeat, he is arrested, allowing Alder to resume his position as the Pokémon Champion of the Unova region. N then thanks the player for helping realize his mistake {{about the nature of the}} relationship between people and their Pokémon before leaving the castle on his captured Pokémon to a far-off land.|$|E

5|$|Birth by Sleep is a prequel to {{the first}} Kingdom Hearts game, taking place ten years prior. Like the other games in the series, the player {{progresses}} through a collection of various worlds, based on various locales from the Disney animated features canon: Dwarf Woodlands from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Enchanted Dominion from Sleeping Beauty, Castle of Dreams from Cinderella, Olympus Coliseum from Hercules, Deep Space from Lilo & Stitch, Neverland from Peter Pan and Mysterious Tower from Fantasia. The game also features various new worlds specially created for the series by Square Enix such as the Land of Departure and Radiant Garden. Disney Town, which is the town <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> <b>the</b> castle grounds of Disney Castle, serves as the game's minigame world. Worlds such as Destiny Islands and Castle Oblivion also appear {{in the form of}} cutscenes, while the 100 Acre Wood from the Winnie the Pooh franchise, which had appeared in most other games of the series, only appears as a Command Board in Birth by Sleep. The staff first chose the worlds based on the game's scenario, leading to the inclusion of Princesses' worlds. They then added the worlds of Neverland and Deep Space to add variety to the game, while Olympus Coliseum was selected to reflect the game's earlier setting compared to the original Kingdom Hearts.|$|E
