40|$|Abstract-Encouraging {{cooperation}} in self-organizing ad hoc networks {{has been an}} important task in the last few years. <b>The</b> main focus <b>of</b> previous work is on providing protocols which encourage packet forwarding in multi-hop networks in absence ofamanaged infrastructure. Protocols proposed to date, however, do not consider any aspects <b>of</b> anonymity. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> communication entities as well as <b>the</b> route including <b>the</b> <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intermediate nodes are revealed. In this paper, we propose a protocol that provides an efficient incentive mechanism for forwarding packets while keeping <b>the</b> <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participating entities private and untraceable.

5|$|Artanis is {{the primary}} Protoss protagonist and player {{character}} in the StarCraft franchise. Artanis is a high templar and a military commander introduced in Brood War.

5|$|Controversy {{regarding}} <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> filaments {{preserved in}} the first Sinosauropteryx specimen began almost immediately, as the team of scientists spent three days in Beijing examining the specimen under a microscope. The results of their studies (reported during a press conference at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences on Thursday, April 24, 1997) were inconclusive; the team agreed that the structures preserved on Sinosauropteryx were not modern feathers, but suggested further research was required to discover their exact nature. Palaeontologist Alan Feduccia, {{who had not yet}} examined the specimen, wrote in Audubon Magazine that the structures of Sinosauropteryx (which he considered at the time to be a synonym of Compsognathus, as Compsognathus prima) were stiffening structures from a frill running along the back, and that dinosaur palaeontologists were engaging in wishful thinking when equating the structures with feathers. Subsequent publications saw some of the team members disagreeing over <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structures.|$|E
5|$|Historians have {{disagreed}} over <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{doctor who}} pronounced Beiderbecke dead.

Beiderbecke's mother and brother took the train to New York and brought his body home to Davenport. He was buried there on August 11 in the family plot at Oakdale Cemetery.|$|E

In contrast, the bluing of other boletes {{has been attributed to}} the oxidation of variegatic or xerocomic acid. Gyrocyanin is biosynthesized from intermediates supplied by the shikimate pathway, a metabolic route used by fungi for the synthesis of aromatic amino acids.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> toxic {{constituents}} eluded researchers until 1968, when acetaldehyde N-methyl-N-formylhydrazone, {{better known}} as gyromitrin, was isolated. Gyromitrin is a volatile water-soluble hydrazine compound hydrolyzed in the body into monomethylhydrazine (MMH). Other N-methyl-N-formylhydrazone derivatives have been isolated in subsequent research, although they are present in smaller amounts. These other compounds would also produce monomethylhydrazine when hydrolyzed, although it remains unclear how much each contributes to the false morel's toxicity.|$|E
