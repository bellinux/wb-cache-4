5|$|Traditionally, the West of China {{has been}} weaker economically, as it {{promises}} a less lucrative {{return to the}} investors than its eastern competitors. Thus, the China Western Development policy aimed to attract foreign investment. This was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> creating a more stable investing environment through infrastructure construction. The {{creation of a new}} economic zone would encourage cooperation between cities, which would lead to greater rates of progress.|$|E
5|$|Maverick Hunter was in {{development}} by Armature Studio and {{was to be}} published by Capcom for the Mega Man X series. The collaboration was established by Keiji Inafune, who had previously worked on the Mega Man series as an artist and producer. He had since rose in the ranks at Capcom to become a producer. The goal was to attract a new audience to the Mega Man series. Its development would have been overseen by former Capcom producer Ben Judd. The redesign for the Mega Man character was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> Adi Granov (the concept artist responsible for the Iron Man redesign found in the 2008 film of the same name). An initial concept design showed X with a red glowing 'X' on his face.|$|E
5|$|The press {{reported}} weekly on {{the building}} of Boydell's gallery, designed by George Dance the Younger, on a site in Pall Mall. Boydell commissioned works from famous painters of the day, such as Joshua Reynolds, and the folio of engravings proved the enterprise's most lasting legacy. However, the long delay in publishing the prints and the illustrated edition prompted criticism. Because they were hurried, and many illustrations had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> lesser artists, the final products of Boydell's venture were judged to be disappointing. The project caused the Boydell firm to become insolvent, and {{they were forced to}} sell the gallery at a lottery.|$|E

5|$|The SSEM {{had been}} {{designed}} by the team of Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill. To develop the Mark 1 {{they were joined by}} two research students, D.B.G.Edwards and G. E. Thomas; work began in earnest in August 1948. The project soon had the dual purpose of supplying Ferranti with a working design on which they could base a commercial machine, the Ferranti Mark 1, and of building a computer that would allow researchers to gain experience of how such a machine could be used in practice. The first of the two versions of the Manchester Mark 1– known as the Intermediary Version– was operational by April 1949. However, this first version lacked features such as the instructions necessary to programmatically transfer data between the main store and its newly developed magnetic backing store, which had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> halting the machine and manually initiating the transfer. These missing features were incorporated in the Final Specification version, which was fully working by October 1949. The machine contained 4,050 valves and had a power consumption of 25 kilowatts. To increase reliability, purpose-built CRTs made by GEC were used in the machine instead of the standard devices used in the SSEM.|$|E

25|$|Much of Scott's hauling was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> ponies, {{which are}} ill-suited {{to work on}} snow and ice without snow-shoes.

Later, India declined to consider any further applications for citizenship, stating that the 1964 agreement had lapsed.|$|E

25|$|The gas {{follows the}} {{behaviour}} {{described by the}} gas laws, which describe how a gas's pressure, temperature and volume are related. When the gas is heated the pressure rises (because {{it is in a}} sealed chamber) and this pressure then acts on the power piston to produce a power stroke. When the gas is cooled the pressure drops and this drop means that less work needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> the piston to compress the gas on the return stroke; the difference in work between the strokes yields a net positive power output.|$|E

Abu Ageila was a small oasis in the desert situated on an important road junction. It contained a few clay houses and a village, a water well and a dam for water collection in the winter months.|$|E

The yield from {{the first phase of}} mining will be ground through one semi-autogenous grinding mill (SAG mill).
