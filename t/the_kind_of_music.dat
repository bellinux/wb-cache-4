It’s just {{something}} I’ve {{had to learn to}} live with. It affects your playing style; you can’t feel the strings, and there are certain chords I can’t play. Right at the beginning I was told by doctors: “You won’t be playing guitar.” But I believed I could do it, and I did.|$|E
25|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Takeshi Abo. His process for composing the music consisted of him reading the game's story, {{to get an}} as full as possible understanding of the setting and the character personalities. He considered his first impressions of the game's emotional flow and events to be very important: he would write them down together with <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> {{he would want to}} use for each scene, and keep them in mind when composing the music. He said that this approach, while taking longer than if he had just designated songs to various places in the game, made for higher quality music with a better relation to the game's worldview.|$|E

25|$|In 1984, Hill revived {{his musical}} version of The Phantom of the Opera. This time though, {{he wanted to}} add <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> {{that would have been}} heard at the Opéra Garnier in the late 19th century. Consequently, he {{discarded}} the modern score by Ian Armit and wrote original English lyrics that told Gaston Leroux’s tale. By placing them to opera arias by Gounod, Offenbach, Verdi, Weber, Mozart, Donizetti, and Boito, he created a musical that reflected the era in which the original novel was written. This updated version of The Phantom of the Opera was produced in a joint production by the Newcastle Playhouse and the Theatre Royal Stratford East, and premiered at the Newcastle Playhouse on 3 April 1984, before shortly moving to the Theatre Royal Stratford East. In between, the show had two very brief runs at the New Tyne Theatre in Newcastle and the Grand Theatre in Wolverhampton - neither of those productions did very well. When the show got the Theatre Royal Stratford East, Sarah Brightman, who created the role of Christine in the Lloyd Webber version, was famously asked to perform the role of Christine in the 1984 cast but she turned it down, leaving the role for the opera singer Christina Collier.|$|E
500|$|One review {{about the}} soundtrack said that, [...] "this is no {{ordinary}} album and will be preferred by musical elites. Infused with classical music and Rajasthani folk music, {{it is a good}} quality album coming out of Salim-Sulaiman. But the shortcoming comes in the form that this is not <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> that'll please every ear." [...] Another review, in a similar tone, said that the album [...] "works only for those who are either followers of classical music or enjoy hearing songs with a Rajasthani folk music base. There is no doubt that composers good quality throughout, but overall the album caters only to a niche audience." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2003, Harisu {{made the}} {{decision}} to leave her management company, TTM Entertainment. However, TTM claimed to hold the rights to her stage name, and announced their intentions to use that name to promote other artists. The matter was taken to court, and in early 2004 the ruling went in favour of Harisu, allowing her to keep the name. She subsequently set up her own company, G Entertainment, in order to make her own decisions regarding her career. In February she released her third album, Foxy Lady, which marked a change from the sound of her previous albums towards a more hip-hop/R style, with Harisu saying [...] "now I am on my own, and showing my true colors, doing exactly <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> that I've always wanted." [...] The album, however, failed to make the top 50 in the Korean charts.|$|E

50|$|The {{usual way}} of dealing with this problem is to build an organ in which the pipes are divided into several {{sections}} or divisions, one or more of which are enclosed in a swell box or boxes, the other divisions remaining unenclosed.

500|$|After {{the first}} rumour circulated, Joe Goddard created a reverse rumour, saying that Minogue {{had written a}} track for Hot Chip. He told NME, [...] "Kylie wrote a song for us, She sent it through our {{management}} to us– it was totally bizarre. It was {{the beginnings of a}} track– I think she wrote it and just thought, 'This would be perfect for Hot Chip', or possibly for a collaboration. It's a crazy song. It's industrial and clanging and even has farmyard animal noises on it. It's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> you'd never normally associate with Kylie. When I'm allowed to send it around it's going to change a few people's ideas about her. Maybe it's one for our next album, after Made in the Dark." [...] Taylor later admitted that it was a joke created to fool people because the band were tired of people phoning them up to ask why Minogue had apparently rejected a song she did not hear. Goddard said, [...] "We've been telling lots of lies and rumours about it because we found it quite funny." ...|$|E
500|$|Among Dylan's contemporaries, Phil Ochs was {{impressed}} by Highway 61, explaining: [...] "It's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> that plants a seed in your mind {{and then you have}} to hear it several times. And as you go over it you start to hear more and more things. He's done something that's left the whole field ridiculously in the back of him." [...] In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine described Highway 61 as [...] "one of those albums that changed everything", and placed it at numberfour in its list of [...] "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time". The Rolling Stone list of [...] "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time" [...] ranked [...] "Highway 61 Revisited", [...] "Desolation Row" [...] and [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] at number373, number187, and numberone, respectively. In 2012, The Best 100 Albums of All Time book ranked Highway 61 Revisited as the greatest album of all time. It was also included in Robert Christgau's [...] "Basic Record Library" [...] of 1960s music and Robert Dimery's 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E
500|$|The label {{had also}} been known for {{carrying}} out the management concept of [...] "condominium". Originally conceived and penned by Cowell, it gave artists authority and responsibility over their recorded material independently, {{as well as the}} ability to assign the master tapes over to the label for distribution. Strata-East artists had more control over their recordings than major labels at the time had offered. Music journalist Kevin Moist later wrote of the label's [...] "condominium" [...] concept, [...] "The idea was to try and develop an independent cultural space outside of the mainstream that could function self-sufficiently and be genuinely participatory for its members. The goal was to live in an engaged way where art, society, spirituality, and politics could all come together holistically in an integrated existence. That (sub)cultural renewal is embodied in <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> midwifed by Strata-East." [...] The label's philosophy for artist management and recording ethic worked to the advantage of artists such as Gil Scott-Heron and Brian Jackson. Scott-Heron and Jackson were able to release more aesthetically personalized recordings for Strata-East than most mainstream labels would allow.|$|E

500|$|A Bollywood {{version of}} the song was done by Indian music {{producer}} duo Salim and Sulaiman Merchant. The remix was released on DesiHits.com, a website for South Asian music and entertainment news. The Merchants were discussing music projects with Anjula Acharia-Bath of DesiHits.com, {{when they came to}} learn that Gaga, who did not have much reach within the Indian diaspora, was interested in a Bollywood remix for [...] "Born This Way". The Merchants were contacted by Gaga's manager, Troy Carter, and the remix was finalized. Sulaiman explained that they received Gaga's raw vocals from [...] "Born This Way", and using it as a base, they designed the remix. [...] "We sent her a rough cut of our composition for initial feedback on whether we were giving it the right groove. She loved it and that's how we went about it," [...] he added. The Merchants used a number of Indian musical instruments like the dugi, sitar by Sunil Das, and the dhol and dholak in the chorus. Salim said that he sang a little bit of alaap to give the remix a Sufi touch, [...] "as that's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> we do and it was also about adding our signature." [...] Gaga's management team were satisfied with their remix and wanted them to do another remix of her next song, [...] "Judas". The Bollywood remixes were a part of the Indian track list of Born This Way.|$|E
500|$|Wolfgang Flür {{has stated}} Kraftwerk were {{influenced}} by {{the music of the}} Weimar Germany era: [...] "we were children who were born straight after World War Two ... we had no musical or pop culture of our own ... there was the war, and before the war we had only the German folk music. In the 1920s or 1930s melodies were developed and these became culture that we worked from". Karl Bartos also spoke of post-war influence as the group thought that they [...] "had this development in the 1920s which was very, very strong and was audio visual. We had the Bauhaus school before the war and then after the war we had tremendous people like Karlheinz Stockhausen and the development of the classical and the electronic classical. This was very strong and it all happened very close to Düsseldorf in Cologne and all the great composers at that time came there." [...] Paul Alessandrini is credited for helping contribute to the album's concept. Alessandrini told Hütter and Schneider that [...] "with <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> you do, which is kind of like an electronic blues, railway stations and trains are very important in your universe, you should do a song about the Trans Europe Express". Kraftwerk believed critics in the United Kingdom and the United States associated them with Nazi Germany, with tracks such as [...] "Autobahn" [...] inextricably linked with the Nazis who built the high-speed roads in the 1930s and 1940s. At the same time, the band were keen to move away from their German heritage towards a new sense of European identity and felt that the Trans Europ Express could be used to symbolize this. Allmusic referred to Trans-Europe Express as a concept album with two different themes. The first being the disparities between reality and image, represented by the songs [...] "Hall of Mirrors" [...] and [...] "Showroom Dummies", and the others about the glorification of Europe. Slant Magazine described the album as [...] "a sonic poem to Europe".|$|E
500|$|Bandslam {{was bought}} by a studio back in 2004, but in late January 2007, Walden Media and Summit Entertainment {{announced}} that they would co-finance Bandslam, co-written by Todd Graff and Josh A. Cagan and directed by Graff. Graff was hired to direct in early March 2007 and rewrote the screenplay. Before filming, they had two weeks of music rehearsals. The actors and actresses were designated to play their instruments. Donowho and Michalka had extensive experience with the drums and guitar, respectively, so {{they were used to}} their instruments, but Lisa Chung, Scott Porter and Vanessa Hudgens were not. Hudgens told MTV News she didn't expect there to be as much music, and [...] "they are like, 'We are going to have two weeks of music rehearsals,' and I was like, 'What?' But it was really cool. It's definitely not <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> I do normally." [...] Principal photography began on February 9, 2008 in Austin, Texas. Although the film is set in New Jersey, Graff felt strongly {{that it was important to}} shoot in a place with a wide array of great live music to choose from. [...] "I'm a big believer in local scenes," [...] he says. [...] "I think it's the lifeblood of music. Austin is renowned as a music town, and rightly so. They have a ton of really great bands just trying to get their music out there. So, it's great we had an opportunity to use several unsigned local Texas bands." [...] In an interview with Los Angeles Times, director Todd Graff admitted there were cultural incongruities underlying the film. [...] "I know, it's demented. Every once in a while on set I would think to myself, 'I can't believe we got away with this'. I always thought if it only sent one kid to listen to a Velvet Underground record, it would be worth it to me." [...] All of the vocals were filmed live by each of the singing cast members, as mentioned by director Graff. One of the requirements for the film was that all actors had to be able to provide their own vocals. Because Aly Michalka was on tour with her sister AJ Michalka and Miley Cyrus, she did not arrive in Austin until midway through rehearsals. Conveniently, the tour's last stop was in Austin, where rehearsal and filming for the movie took place. All of the instruments and singing in the movie were recorded by the actors, with the exception of the guitar parts of Vanessa Hudgens and Scott Porter, as well as Lisa Chung's piano parts. Although Hudgens and Porter learned how to play their songs, they were dubbed by guitarists Jason Mozersky and JW Wright.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding {{her music}} Newton stated in 1987, [...] "Its country-rock or pop-country or Nashville rock or some word like that, but I feel it`s <b>the</b> same <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> that Fleetwood Mac was. To me, that music was folk-rock." ...|$|R

2500|$|The band flew to New York {{to record}} their debut eponymous album, Baby Animals, at Bearsville Studios, Woodstock and Second City Studio, Long Island with ex-pat Australian Mike Chapman producing. DeMarchi said of the {{production}} process: [...] "It was great. Basically, Mike left us alone to make <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> {{we know how to}} make; and whenever he did have a suggestion, it was always something that made the sound better.

2500|$|The {{island is}} also known for [...] "Jamband music", which is <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> {{performed}} by local bands during the [...] "Culturama Festival" [...] and is key to [...] "Jouvert" [...] dancing. [...] The sounds of the so-called [...] "Iron Band" [...] are also popular within the culture; many locals come together using any old pans, sinks, or other kits of any sort; which they [...] use to create sounds and music. This form of music is played throughout the villages during the Christmas and carnival seasons.|$|E
2500|$|If one {{considers}} the life of Richard Wetz, {{it is not surprising}} that in the 1929 Riemann Music Encyclopedia he was stated to have [...] "arranged to be a loner [...] ". His stature was less than other composers of the time and the new achievements of contemporaries such as Arnold Schoenberg, Maurice Ravel or Franz Schreker left him behind. Increasingly, the accepted cultural pessimism violently railed against <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> that Wetz was writing. Wetz was more related in attitude with such keepers of 19th century tradition such as Sergei Rachmaninoff, Hans Pfitzner and Franz Schmidt, than his contemporaries.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 1953 Bernie Glow was a first-call trumpet {{player and}} played on {{thousands}} of recording sessions. There was great variety in <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> being recorded; One day he would play a radio commercial for Pepsi, and the next he would record an album with Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald. Many of these studio big-band sessions were led by leading composer/arrangers Nelson Riddle, Quincy Jones and Oliver Nelson. He played on the seminal Miles Davis and Gil Evans collaborations that produced the masterpiece albums Miles Ahead (1957), Porgy and Bess (1958), Sketches of Spain (1959), and Quiet Nights (1962).

2500|$|The group's first album, Dire Straits, was {{recorded}} at Basing Street studios in Notting Hill, London in February 1978, {{at a cost}} of £12,500.

The album {{came to the attention of}} A representative Karin Berg, working at Warner Bros. Records in New York City. She felt that it was <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> audiences were hungry for, but only one person in her department agreed at first. Many of the songs on the album reflected Mark Knopfler's experiences in Newcastle, Leeds and London. [...] "Down to the Waterline" [...] recalled images of life in Newcastle; [...] "In the Gallery" [...] is a tribute to Leeds sculptor/artist Harry Phillips (father of Steve Phillips); [...] "Wild West End" [...] and [...] "Lions" [...] were drawn from Knopfler's early days in the capital.|$|E
2500|$|Predicting {{critical}} reception to the {{new direction}} of the album, Cronise proposed that [...] "It will absolutely alienate some fans. <b>The</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> we play is partially described as heavy metal and unfortunately, a lot of dudes that like heavy metal are very narrow-minded and only like it to sound one particular way. So I'm sure we alienated people with our second album." [...] Despite this, he assured that {{the sound of the}} music would not change as much, explaining that [...] "There'll definitely still be heavy stuff on the record, and fast, thrashy, and slow and sludgy stuff like we've done before. Heavy metal, basically. But a lot of the songs are just what I'd call hard rock songs. The attitude and the vibe is different. It's not as aggressive, sonically. It's a little bit more ... I don't know how to explain it. It's just rock. It's a rock album. Some parts will be heavier than the heaviest stuff we've done, but at the same time, there will be acoustic stuff. It is a varied record, I guess.|$|E

He decided to write and produce his next album himself, surprising many others, given that Alun Davies, his close friend and first guitar in his backing band, and his producer, Paul Samwell-Smith in particular, were instrumental in assisting Stevens to form the definitive signature sound that had brought Stevens to {{the height of his}} stardom.
