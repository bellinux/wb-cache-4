In this Review, we discuss some of the general principles of enzymatic reactions confined on surfaces, at interfaces, and inside small volumes.

40|$|Nowadays, {{huge amount}} of {{documents}} are increasingly transferred to the remote servers due <b>to</b> the <b>appealing</b> <b>features</b> of cloud computing. On the other hand, privacy and security of the sensitive information in untrusted cloud environment is a big concern. To alleviate such concerns, encryption of sensitive data before its transfer to the cloud has become an important risk mitigation option. Encrypted storage provides protection {{at the expense of}} {{a significant increase in the}} data management complexity. For effective management, it is critical to provide efficient selective document retrieval capability on the encrypted collection. In fact, considerable amount of searchable symmetric encryption schemes have been designed in the literature to achieve this task. However, with the emergence of big data everywhere, available approaches are insufficient to address some crucial real-world problems such as scalability. In this study, we focus on practical aspects of a secure keyword search mechanism over encrypted data on a real cloud infrastructure. First, we propose a provably secure distributed index along with a parallelizable retrieval technique that can easily scale to big data. Second, we integrate authorization into the search scheme to limit the information leakage in multi-user setting where users are allowed to access only particular documents. Third, we offer efficient updates on the distributed secure index. In addition, we conduct extensive empirical analysis on a real dataset to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed practical techniques...|$|R
40|$|EPDM rubber {{is widely}} used in a diverse type of applications, such as the automotive, {{industrial}} and construction sectors among others. Due <b>to</b> its <b>appealing</b> <b>features,</b> the consumption of vulcanized EPDM rubber is growing significantly. However, environmental issues are forcing the application of devulcanization processes to facilitate the recovery, which has led rubber manufacturers to implement strict quality controls. Consequently, {{it is important to}} develop methods for supervising the vulcanizing and recovering processes of such products. This paper deals with the supervision process of EPDM compounds by means of Fourier transform mid-infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and suitable multivariate statistical methods. A nondestructive and expeditive classification approach was applied to a sufficient number of EPDM samples with different applied processes, that is, with and without application of vulcanizing agents, vulcanized samples and microwave treated samples. First the FTIR spectra of the samples is acquired and next it is processed by applying suitable feature extraction methods, i. e., principal component analysis (PCA) and canonical variate analysis (CVA) to obtain the latent variables to be used for classifying test EPDM samples. Finally, the k-NN (k nearest neighbor) algorithm was used in the classification stage. Experimental results prove the accuracy of the proposed method and the potential of FTIR spectroscopy in this area, since the classification accuracy can be as high as 100 %.

40|$|Abstract — In recent years, due <b>to</b> the <b>appealing</b> <b>features</b> {{of cloud}} computing, {{large amount of}} data have been stored in the cloud. Although cloud based {{services}} offer many advantages, privacy and security of the sensitive data is a big concern. To mitigate the concerns, it is desirable to outsource sensitive data in encrypted form. Encrypted storage protects the data against illegal access, but it complicates some basic, yet important func-tionality such as the search on the data. To achieve search over encrypted data without compromising the privacy, considerable amount of searchable encryption schemes have been proposed in the literature. However, {{almost all of them}} handle exact query matching but not similarity matching; a crucial requirement for real world applications. Although some sophisticated secure multi-party computation based cryptographic techniques are available for similarity tests, they are computationally intensive and do not scale for large data sources. In this paper, we propose an efficient scheme for similarity search over encrypted data. To do so, we utilize a state-of-the-art algorithm for fast near neighbor search in high dimensional spaces called locality sensitive hashing. To ensure the confidential-ity of the sensitive data, we provide a rigorous security definition and prove the security of the proposed scheme under the provided definition. In addition, we provide a real world application of the proposed scheme and verify the theoretical results with empirical observations on a real dataset. I...|$|R
40|$|Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is an {{electromagnetic}} technique very {{appreciated by}} {{the community of the}} archaeologist and cultural heritage end-users community thanks <b>to</b> its <b>appealing</b> <b>features</b> in terms of non invasivity and rapidity of measurement and diagnostics. However, GPR data requires a high operator expertise in the data processing and interpretation. In the archaeological investigation, this drawback can be mitigated by the availability of a priori information about the archaeological scenario. On the other hand, {{in the case of the}} historical heritage, when the knowledge of constructive modalities and material of the structure may be completely missed, it is necessary to undertake other strategies of processing and interpretation. One of these can be provided by the use of novel inversion algorithms such as the Microwave Tomography (MT) which allows to reduce the subjectivity and the time consuming during the data processing. In this paper the MT was applied on raw data collected at two historical buildings of Chania (Crete, Greece). The first edifice is the Venizelo's House affected by visible fractures in its walls made up of cemented irregular stones. The second one is the headquarters of Prefecture of Chania showing some fractures along the floors. For these raw data, microwave tomography provided well detailed images which allowed to infer the fracture geometry and their extension in the host medium. This suggests microwave tomography can be a reliable complete processing tool requiring only the definition of the background scenario in terms of the dielectric permittivity and the conductivity of the host medium...|$|R
40|$|A "weak" {{formulation}} of the pseudo-excitation (PE) approach was recently proposed for structural damage detection in thin-walled structures. The method was shown <b>to</b> exhibit some <b>appealing</b> <b>features</b> including high noise tolerant ability. However, the method requires very dense displacement field measurement within the inspection region. To tackle the problem, a new damage detection method based on virtual element boundary measurement (VEBM) under the "weak" formulation framework is proposed in this paper. VEBM based "weak" formulation divides the entire structure into several "virtual elements" (VE). By tuning the vibration frequency to the natural frequency of the VE, the "weak" formulation is shown to provide a "region-by-region" detection strategy, allowing reliable damage detection by using {{only a small number}} of measurement points at the VE boundaries. The effectiveness of the proposed method was first validated numerically using a cantilever beam containing a small damage. Influences of various factors such as measurement noise levels and frequency discrepancies between the ideal and the actual elements were discussed. An experiment was carried out through a Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) measurement. Results demonstrated that VEBM method can achieve good detection results by using a small number of measurement points, whilst providing enhanced noise tolerant capability against measurement uncertainties.

40|$|It is {{the basic}} tenet of the {{functional}} approach to typology {{that at least some}} linguistic universals may be explained by <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> <b>features</b> of language use. But the mechanics of the mapping between function and distribution are seldom made explicit. In this paper, a theory of linguistic adaptation is set out in which universals are treated as phenomena of the third kind in Keller's (1994) terms, i. e. objects which are the result of human actions but not the goal of their intentions. In this view universals emerge at a global level from the interactions of individuals whose actions locally can be described in terms of functional motivations. Computational models of this process (an invisible hand process) can be set up to see what universals emerge with different functional pressures in place. Using this model, Keenan and Comrie's accessibility hierarchy is shown to emerge when competing functional pressures relating to structural complexity and morphological complexity are taken in [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Drug-eluting stents (DES) have {{revolutionized}} {{the way that}} advanced coronary heart disease is now treated. These devices are associated with much lower rates of restenosis than their bare metal stent counterparts. However, {{the presence of a}} polymer coating on the stent surface, which allows for incorporation and sustained release of drug into the artery, has been implicated in the occurrence of late stent thrombosis. Consequently, a great many different polymer-free DES have since been developed. Early approaches involving direct loading of the drug on to unmodified stent surfaces were largely ineffective, which was likely due to suboptimal drug delivery kinetics characterized by very rapid release. It has since been found that stent surface modification strategies at the macro, micro and nanoscale can be used to provide more sustained drug release, with some of these strategies producing clinical results that are comparable to polymer-coated DES. Emerging clinical data {{on the use of the}} Cre 8, BioFreedom, and the latest Drug Filled Stent from Medtronic Inc. suggest that these particular polymer-free DES may inhibit restenosis without delaying recovery of the endothelium, which would represent a step change improvement in performance. Whilst these devices would therefore appear to be particularly beneficial in treating high bleeding risk patients, the reduction in antiplatelet therapy duration required is likely <b>to</b> be an <b>appealing</b> <b>feature</b> that may see them make a wider impact more generally...|$|R
40|$|In recent {{attempts}} {{to characterize the}} cognitive mechanisms underlying altruistic motivation, one central question {{is the extent to}} which the capacity for altruism depends on the capacity for understanding other minds, or ‘mindreading’. Some theorists maintain that the capacity for altruism is independent of any capacity for mindreading; others maintain that the capacity for altruism depends on fairly sophisticated mindreading skills. I argue that none of the prevailing accounts is adequate. Rather, I argue that altruistic motivation depends on a basic affective system, a ‘Concern Mechanism’, which requires only a minimal capacity for mindreading.

40|$|Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) {{technology}} has recently attracted much research interest due <b>to</b> its <b>appealing</b> <b>features</b> in short-range mobile communications. These features include high-data rates, low power consumption, multiple-access communications and precise positioning capabilities. Space-Time Coding (STC) techniques, such as block coding and trellis coding, {{are known to}} be simple and practical ways to increase both the spectral efficiency and the capacity in wireless communications. The the- sis aims at designing robust and efficient space-time coding schemes well adapted to single-band UWB signalling. Thus, this work incorporates a fine analysis of a stan- dard Single Input Single Output (SISO) single-band UWB system, scrutinising every important aspect of this system including transceiver structure, channel modelling, multiple-access techniques and detection process. Research also leads to the deriva- tion of a novel closed-form approximation for the average probability of bit-error for single-band UWB systems. This in-depth study highlights drawbacks inherent to UWB systems such as time-jitter effects or rake-receiver complexity and proposes schemes that benefit from spatial diversity to mitigate these problems. Thus, the thesis concentrates on the design of new multiple-antenna space-time coding systems tailored for UWB communications. As a result, this work derives and generates gen- eralised full-rate space-time block codes based on orthogonal pulses to capture both spatial and multipath diversities. Space-time trellis coded modulation is then revis- ited to further improve the spectral efficiency limit and to deliver the high-data rates promised by UWB technology. A new version of space-time trellis coding is developed for the peculiar UWB signalling structure. Finally, thanks to a novel closed-form ap- proximation, a theoretical comparison is undertaken between any SISO-UWB system and the multiple antenna UWB systems proposed in this thesis. The results clearly underline the impact of STC on a single-band UWB system in terms of enhanced robustness against timing-jitter effects, higher spectral efficiency and capacity im- provement. These advantages are finally confirmed through the numerical evaluation of the error-rate performance. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
