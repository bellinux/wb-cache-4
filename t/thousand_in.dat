5|$|The book {{debuted in}} America on November 7, 1960 {{during the week}} of John Kennedy's election. At the time of the book's release, Neill was unknown in the United States, and not a single {{bookseller}} purchased an advance copy. Summerhill brought him international renown over the next decade. The book sold 24,000 copies in its first year, 100 <b>thousand</b> <b>in</b> 1968, 200 <b>thousand</b> <b>in</b> 1969, two million total by 1970, and three million by 1973. Summerhill was included in over 600 American university courses, and a 1969 translation for West Germany (The Theory and Practice of Anti-Authoritarian Education) sold over a million copies in three years. In the wake of the book's success, publisher Harold Hart started the American Summerhill Society in New York City, of which Paul Goodman was a founding member.|$|E

5|$|After {{extensive}} research {{that began in}} the 90s, a second push took place in March 2003, when the Brazilian subsidiary of Volkswagen launched to the market the first full flexible-fuel car, the Gol 1.6 Total Flex. Several months later was followed by other Brazilian automakers, and by 2010 General Motors, Fiat, Ford, Peugeot, Renault, Volkswagen, Honda, Mitsubishi, Toyota, Citroën, Nissan and Kia Motors were producing popular models of flex cars and light trucks. The adoption of ethanol flex fuel vehicles was so successful, that production of flex cars went from almost 40 <b>thousand</b> <b>in</b> 2003 to 1.7 million in 2007. This rapid adoption of the flex technology was facilitated by the fuel distribution infrastructure already in place, as around 27,000 filling stations countrywide were available by 1997 with at least one ethanol pump, a heritage of the Pró-Álcool program.|$|E

5|$|Boron has two {{naturally}} occurring and stable isotopes, 11B (80.1%) and 10B (19.9%). The mass difference {{results in a}} wide range of δ11B values, which are defined as a fractional difference between the 11B and 10B and traditionally expressed in parts per <b>thousand,</b> <b>in</b> natural waters ranging from −16 to +59. There are 13 known isotopes of boron, the shortest-lived isotope is 7B which decays through proton emission and alpha decay. It has a half-life of 3.5×10−22 s. Isotopic fractionation of boron is controlled by the exchange reactions of the boron species B(OH)3 and −. Boron isotopes are also fractionated during mineral crystallization, during H2O phase changes in hydrothermal systems, and during hydrothermal alteration of rock. The latter effect results in preferential removal of the − ion onto clays. It results in solutions enriched in 11B(OH)3 and therefore may be responsible for the large 11B enrichment in seawater relative to both oceanic crust and continental crust; this difference may act as an isotopic signature.|$|E

5|$|Surveys have {{revealed}} {{an average of}} 436 structures per square kilometer (1118 per square mile) in the site core, falling to 244 structures/km² (626/square mile) in the periphery. At its height in the Late Preclassic, the population has been estimated at 1600 in the site core with a further 8000 dispersed through the periphery, to produce an estimated total population of almost ten <b>thousand.</b> <b>In</b> the Early Classic the population suffered a severe decline, population is estimated to have dropped to 34% of peak population. In the Late to Terminal Classic the population increased to 85% of its Late Preclassic level, an expansion {{that appears to have}} occurred rapidly and spread to all parts of the site, perhaps as the result of an influx of refugees arriving from other sites around AD 830. This was followed by a population crash to 14% of peak Preclassic population in the Early Postclassic (AD 9001200) prior to the complete abandonment of the site.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} eggs laid depends on species, with batch sizes ranging {{from two to}} several dozen. The total number of eggs {{produced}} in a female's lifetime (fecundity) varies from around one hundred to several <b>thousand.</b> <b>In</b> some species, the flea lives in the nest or burrow and the eggs are deposited on the substrate, but in others, the eggs are laid on the host itself and can easily fall off onto the ground. Because of this, areas where the host rests and sleeps {{become one of the}} primary habitats of eggs and developing larvae. The eggs take around two days to two weeks to hatch. Experiments have shown that fleas lay more eggs on hosts which have limited food intakes, and that eggs and larvae survive better under these conditions, perhaps because the host's immune system is compromised.|$|E
5|$|The state {{experienced}} budget shortages {{because of}} low tax revenues, which forced Jennings to pursue other means of financing the projects. The main sources of funds came from issuing government bonds to the state bank and sales of public lands. The state's spending and borrowing led to short-term budget problems, but despite early setbacks (poor access to capital eventually halted improvement programs and caused the Indiana Canal Company to fold {{because of lack of}} funds), the infrastructure improvements initiated by Jennings attracted new settlers to the state. By 1810 the Indiana Territory's population within the boundaries of the new state was 24, 520. In the decades following his governorship, Indiana's population grew from sixty-five <b>thousand</b> <b>in</b> 1816 to 147,178 in 1820 and surpassed one million by 1850.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1994, United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt first {{proposed}} {{the removal of}} several Pacific Northwest dams because of their impact on salmon spawning. The Northwest Power Planning Council approved a plan that provided more water for fish and less for electricity, irrigation, and transportation. Environmental advocates have called {{for the removal of}} certain dams in the Columbia system in the years since. Of the 227major dams in the Columbia River drainage basin, the four Washington dams on the lower Snake River are often identified for removal, for example in an ongoing lawsuit concerning a Bush administration plan for salmon recovery. These dams and reservoirs limit the recovery of upriver salmon runs to Idaho's Salmon and Clearwater rivers. Historically, the Snake produced over 1.5million spring and summer Chinook salmon, a number that has dwindled to several <b>thousand</b> <b>in</b> recent years. Idaho Power Company's Hells Canyon dams have no fish ladders (and do not pass juvenile salmon downstream), and thus allow no steelhead or salmon to migrate above Hells Canyon. In 2007, the destruction of the Marmot Dam on the Sandy River was the first dam removal in the system. Other Columbia Basin dams that have been removed include Condit Dam on Washington's White Salmon River, and the Milltown Dam on the Clark Fork in Montana.|$|E

5|$|Attempt {{to retake}} {{the town was}} made under the {{leadership}} of the new Swedish Governor-General of Finland Carl Nieroth with 10 000 men strong army supported by naval squadron led by Admiral Olof Wernfelt consisting of 6 ships of the line, 3 frigates and 3 brigantines. Swedish light infantry had started the harassing operations already in the spring of 1711 and naval blockade had been place for most of the summer. Swedish manpower had been sapped by a plague which had struck Finland in late 1710 killing amongst others nearly a <b>thousand</b> <b>in</b> Helsinki alone - half the population at the time. Same plague had struck Karlskrona making it difficult for the Swedish to equip their naval squadron Finland and it took until late June before it was able to sail delaying all Swedish operations. Actual siege by land forces was started in the autumn. However, as king refused to release more troops and supplies from Sweden for the besieging forces the siege was doomed to fail. On 2 December 1711 freezing waters and harsh weather forced the naval force to retire and by the Christmas also the land forces had to withdraw. Nieroth who had invigorated the whole of Finland perished suddenly on 25 January 1712 and was succeeded by weak Georg Henrik Lybecker.|$|E

After completing fitting-out work, the ship was commissioned into the Italian fleet on 4 August 1914. Italy declared neutrality at the start of World War I in August 1914, but by May 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic, which could also be easily seeded with minefields. The threat from these underwater weapons was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations.|$|E
