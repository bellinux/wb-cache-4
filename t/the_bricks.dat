40|$|One of {{the major}} {{elements}} in construction is <b>brick.</b> In Malaysia, <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> is commonly useful as a masonry wall. The improvement in <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> technology is important in reducing the cost of construction. The Rice Husk Ash (RHA) and lime {{is one of the}} elements in improving the strength of <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> as well as reducing <b>the</b> cost of <b>brick.</b> <b>The</b> RHA and lime can be used as the replacement of the sand where the cost of sand is increasing in market. The size of the RHA is less than the sand but it suitable to replace the sand in <b>the</b> <b>brick.</b> <b>The</b> strength of <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> that are containing the RHA and the lime is hoping can achieve the strength of <b>the</b> normal sand <b>brick</b> and can be used at the uncritical masonry in the construction. This study is aiming to determine the compressive strength and the water absorption of <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> that are replacing slightly the sand with RHA and lime. In this research, <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> size used is 117 mm width x 75 mm thickness x 215 mm length. The result of compressive strength test shows the increments of strength of <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> rather than <b>the</b> normal sand <b>brick.</b> Instead of <b>the</b> increments of strength in <b>the</b> <b>brick,</b> there are reductions in the cost of making <b>brick</b> itself.

50|$|A masonry veneer wall {{consists}} of masonry units, usually clay-based bricks, installed {{on one or}} {{both sides of a}} structurally independent wall usually constructed of wood or masonry.

There is typically an air gap between <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> veneer and <b>the</b> structural wall. As clay-based brick is usually not completely waterproof, the structural wall will often have a water-resistant surface (usually tar paper) and weep holes can be left at the base of <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> veneer to drain moisture that accumulates inside the air gap. Concrete blocks, real and cultured stones, and veneer adobe are sometimes used in a very similar veneer fashion.|$|R
