5|$|The media {{predicted}} the Senators to be Stanley Cup contenders, {{as they had}} a strong core back after the lockout, played in an up-tempo style fitting the new rule changes and Hasek was expected to provide <b>top-notch</b> goaltending. The team rushed out of the gate, winning 19 of the first 22 games, in the end winning 52 games and 113 points, placing first in the East, and second overall in the League.|$|E
5|$|Although RSV Lahn-Dill, {{eager to}} develop young players, would only let her {{play in the}} seconds, Dillmann caught the {{attention}} of national coach Holger Glinicki, who was looking for a <b>top-notch</b> 1.0-point player. In 2010, she rejoined the national team that she had played on before many of her new teammates were born. The team {{went on to win the}} European Championships in 2011. Dillmann's treatment contrasted with that of national team mate Gesche Schünemann. While Schünemann received endorsements and could train in the hall of RSV Lahn-Dill's Rivers Barracks, Dillmann got none, and trained outdoors.|$|E
5|$|The main prison {{building}} {{was built in}} 1910–1912 during its time as a United States Army military prison; Alcatraz had been {{the site of a}} citadel since the 1860s. The United States Disciplinary Barracks, Pacific Branch on Alcatraz was acquired by the United States Department of Justice on October 12, 1933, and the island became a prison of the Federal Bureau of Prisons in August 1934 after the buildings were modernized to meet the requirements of a <b>top-notch</b> security prison. Given this high security and the location of Alcatraz in the cold waters and strong currents of San Francisco Bay, the prison operators believed Alcatraz to be escape-proof and America's strongest prison.|$|E
5|$|The {{regular season}} of the 1997–1998 NBA season ended with Rodman winning his seventh {{consecutive}} rebounding title with 15.0boards per game, along with 4.7points per game. He grabbed 20or more rebounds 11times, among them a 29-board outburst against the Atlanta Hawks and 15offensive boards (along with ten defensive) versus the Los Angeles Clippers. Led by the aging Jordan and Rodman (respectively 35 and 37years old), the Bulls reached the 1998 NBA Finals, again versus the Jazz. After playing strong defense on Malone {{in the first three}} games, he caused major consternation when he left his team prior to Game Four to go wrestling with Hulk Hogan. He was fined $20,000, but it was not even ten percent of what he earned with this stint. However, Rodman's on-court performance remained <b>top-notch,</b> again shutting down Malone in Game Four until the latter scored 39points in a Jazz Game Five win, bringing the series to 3–2 from the Bulls perspective. In Game Six, Jordan hit the decisive basket after a memorable drive on Jazz forward Bryon Russell, the Bulls won their third title in a row and Rodman his fifth ring.|$|E

25|$|The Beverly Hills {{was a major}} attraction, {{fewer than}} 10 miles (15km) outside Cincinnati, just across the Ohio River in Southgate, Kentucky, on US 27, near what would later become its {{interchange}} with Interstate 471. It drew its talent from Las Vegas, Nashville, Hollywood and New York, among other places. The site had been a popular nightspot and illegal gambling house as early as 1926; Ohio native Dean Martin had been a blackjack dealer there. It had reopened under the then-current owners and management in 1971 and was considered an elegant, upscale venue that attracted both <b>top-notch</b> talent and <b>top-notch</b> clientele.|$|E

25|$|Waqar's {{first job}} as coach was to lead an inexperienced Pakistan side missing Younis Khan, Mohammad Yousuf and Shoaib Malik to the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 as a consolation, though Waqar had two <b>top-notch</b> bowlers in Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif at his disposal. He guided the {{defending}} champions to the semi-final {{of the tournament}} before they were eliminated by Australia, whose Mike Hussey struck three sixes in the final over.|$|E
25|$|Clites {{recognized}} that these journeying players need {{an incentive to}} come back to St. Louis for their summer months. Their parents likely prefer it, and the availability of a familiar job increases, but that is not enough. The convincing requirement for the student-athlete is whether their summer baseball experience will be <b>top-notch.</b> If Mahrt and Clites could make the domestic product equal or better than anywhere else, people would willingly come back home.|$|E

25|$|When the George Washington {{was inaugurated}} as C's <b>top-notch</b> train on April 30, 1932, {{it was one}} of only two all-air-conditioned, long-distance trains {{operating}} in America. (the other was the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's Capitol Limited, which was instituted as an all-air-conditioned train only a week or so before the George Washington). New equipment was not built for this train; instead, older cars that were completely refurbished by Pullman and by C shops. It was still a few years before the streamliner craze, so C persisted with the standards of the time using its solid, heavy cars.|$|E
25|$|The Uncharted {{series is}} a forum to {{workshop}} and develop new musicals, connecting rising composers and writers to create original works. In 2013, the program expanded, modeling after the Play Group series. In this new development, Uncharted members {{take part in}} a two-year residency, meeting on a monthly basis to present their work and receive peer support and feedback. First year residencies culminate in public concerts offering the writers the chance to debut their new material in front of a live audience. During the second year of their residencies, the writers participate in weeklong workshops of their musicals with <b>top-notch</b> directors and performers, culminating in Out Loud readings.|$|E
25|$|By 1936, LSU had {{the finest}} {{facilities}} in the South, a <b>top-notch</b> faculty of 394 professors, a new medical school, more than 6,000 students, and a winning football team. In only eight years, it had risen in size from 88th {{in the nation to}} 20th, and it was the 11th largest state university in the nation. Long financed these improvements by arranging for the state to purchase acreage from the old LSU campus, which adjoined the grounds of the new State Capitol building in downtown Baton Rouge. To the consternation of his critics, Long essentially diverted $9 million for LSU's expansion and increased the annual operating budget to $2.8 million.|$|E
25|$|Lee–Enfields {{are very}} popular as hunting rifles and target {{shooting}} rifles. Many surplus Lee–Enfield rifles {{were sold in}} Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States after the Second World War, and a fair number have been 'sporterised', having had the front furniture reduced or removed and a scope fitted so that they resemble a bolt-action sporting rifle. <b>Top-notch</b> accuracy is difficult to achieve with the Lee–Enfield design, as {{it was intended to}} be a battle rifle rather than a sharpshooter's weapon, and thus the Enfield is nowadays overshadowed by derivatives of Paul Mauser's design as a target shooting arm. They did, however, continue to be used at Bisley up into the 1970s with some success, and continue to perform extremely well at Military Service Rifle Competitions throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, von Ardenne {{had come}} into his {{inheritance}} with full control as to {{how it could be}} spent, and he established his private research laboratory the Forschungslaboratoriums für Elektronenphysik, in Berlin-Lichterfelde, to conduct his own research on radio and television technology and electron microscopy. He financed the laboratory with income he received from his inventions and from contracts with other concerns. For example, his research on nuclear physics and high-frequency technology was financed by the Reichspostministerium (RPM, Reich Postal Ministry), headed by Wilhelm Ohnesorge. Von Ardenne attracted <b>top-notch</b> personnel to work in his facility, such as the nuclear physicist Fritz Houtermans, in 1940. Von Ardenne had also conducted research on isotope separation. Taking Ewald's suggestion he began building a prototype for the RPM. The work was hampered by war shortages and ultimately ended by the war.|$|E
25|$|By now, Chelsea had a <b>top-notch</b> multi-national squad which {{included}} Zola, Di Matteo, Poyet, Dutch goalkeeper Ed de Goey, and French World Cup-winning trio Frank Leboeuf, Marcel Desailly and Didier Deschamps. Under Vialli, Chelsea {{would become the}} first side in English football to field a starting 11 composed entirely of foreign players, highlighting the increasing internationalization of the game. The 1999–2000 season saw inconsistency return to Chelsea's league form as the side struggled to juggle Premier League and Champions League commitments, ultimately finishing a disappointing fifth. Vialli did lead the team to a second FA Cup win in four years that season – this time against Aston Villa, with Di Matteo again scoring the winner – in the last final to be played at Wembley before its redevelopment. The Charity Shield was added in August with a 2–0 win against Manchester United, to make Vialli Chelsea's then most successful manager.|$|E
25|$|After the 2005–06 season, the Senators {{were faced}} with having their two top defencemen (Redden and Zdeno Chára) {{becoming}} unrestricted free agents, and having to choose to sign only one to keep the team salaries within the League-mandated salary cap. The Senators ultimately chose to retain Redden, and the two agreed on a two-year, $13 million contract with a no-trade clause; Chára signed instead with the Boston Bruins. Redden's salary made him the highest paid player on the team and the media and fans expected another <b>top-notch</b> season. The 2006–07 NHL season was a difficult one for Redden, however, playing with a new defensive partner, Andrej Meszároš, who had previously played on a defensive pair alongside Chára. Despite the initial struggles, {{by the time of}} the 2007 playoffs, Redden and Meszároš had jelled and were a strong pairing for the Senators. Redden participated in all of Ottawa's run to the Stanley Cup Finals, recording 10 points in 20 playoff games, albeit in a losing effort as the Senators eventually lost to the Anaheim Ducks in five games.|$|E
25|$|Notable winning streaks {{during the}} Shula-era in the Orange Bowl include a 13–0 streak against the Buffalo Bills and a 15–0 streak against the New England Patriots, Also of note, the Miami Dolphins enjoyed a record 31-game home winning streak from 1971–75. This 31-game streak {{includes}} four playoff wins and the perfect season of 1972. The Dolphins have not enjoyed {{the same level}} of success in Sun Life Stadium. While much of this lack of success in Sun Life Stadium is obviously attributable to a diminished level of talent and organizational stability, it is also widely recognized that the homefield advantage that the Dolphins enjoyed in the Orange Bowl was exponentially greater than in their newer home. This was in great part due to the atmosphere of the Bowl. The closeness of the seats to the field, along with the closed West End Zone, metal bleachers, and steel structure (and of course the team's success and its status as Miami's only professional sports team for so many years), gave the venue one of the loudest and most electric homefield environments in the NFL. Visiting team quarterbacks often complained to referees or were forced to call time out as their teammates could not hear them barking out the signals due to the unbearable noise, especially when the Dolphins were making a goal-line stand in the closed West End Zone. While Sun Life Stadium is much newer and cleaner and {{is considered one of the}} top facilities in the NFL, with <b>top-notch</b> amenities, the seats are much farther from the field, and even at its loudest, Sun Life Stadium doesn't come close to comparing to that of the Orange Bowl.|$|E
25|$|The quirks of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, {{including}} the turf {{floor and the}} white roof, gave the Twins a significant home-field advantage that played into their winning the World Series in both 1987 and 1991, {{at least in the}} opinion of their opponents, as the Twins went 12–1 in postseason home games during those two seasons. These were the first two World Series in professional baseball history in which a team won the championship by winning all four home games. (The feat has since been repeated once, by the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001.) Nevertheless, the Twins argued that the Metrodome was obsolete and that the lack of a dedicated baseball-only ballpark limited team revenue and made it difficult to sustain a <b>top-notch,</b> competitive team (the Twins had been sharing tenancy in stadiums with the NFL's Minnesota Vikings since 1961). The team was rumored to contemplate moving to such places as New Jersey, Las Vegas, Portland, Oregon, the Greensboro/Winston-Salem, North Carolina, area, and elsewhere in search of a more financially competitive market. In 2002, the team was nearly disbanded when Major League Baseball selected the Twins and the Montreal Expos (now the Washington Nationals franchise) for elimination due to their financial weakness relative to other franchises in the league. The impetus for league contraction diminished after a court decision forced the Twins to play out their lease on the Metrodome. However, Twins owner Carl Pohlad continued his efforts to relocate, pursuing litigation against the Metropolitan Stadium Commission and obtaining a state court ruling that his team was not obligated to play in the Metrodome after the 2006 season. This cleared the way for the Twins to either be relocated or disbanded prior to the 2007 season if a new deal was not reached.|$|E

500|$|IGN {{gave the}} sequel high praise; {{while most of}} the game {{mechanics}} remained unchanged, the addition of more complicated puzzles was welcomed.

Other publications singled out the graphics and audio as particularly strong features.|$|E

500|$|Fodor's {{praised the}} food as a [...] "unique fusion of European and Asian flavors". According to the critic from Time Out Chicago, the {{restaurant}} {{is more of a}} place to impress clients and dates than a <b>top–notch</b> dining experience with <b>top-notch</b> cuisine due to its association with Donald Trump and its views. [...] The magazine's annual Eating & Drinking guide describes the dining room as stately and impressive, the staff as attentive and professional and the food as well-presented. [...] Kamin remarks that although some of the comments that he received by e-mail are not as supportive of the entire structure as they are of the restaurant, the restaurant provides an opportunity for people to emulate Guy de Maupassant, who is said to have disliked the Eiffel Tower so much that he ate at the tower's restaurant daily so as not to have to look at its iron monstrosity. According to the Forbes Travel Guide: 2010 City Guide: Chicago, the hotel hosted one of the seven four-star restaurants in Chicago, which had two five-star restaurants. Three years later, according to the Forbes Travel Guide: 2013 City Guide the restaurant was one of only three five-star restaurants in Chicago. It remained one of only 3 five-star Forbes-rated restaurants in the 2015 Forbes Guide (along with Alinea and Grace).|$|E

500|$|Wark {{was not a}} [...] "supremely talented" [...] player, but, {{according}} to football journalist Jim White, one who espoused team-work and team spirit: [...] "There {{is no question that}} the 'one-for-all, all-for-one' mentality generated in the Anfield dressing room was the engine that drove the great team. With players such as Alan Kennedy, John Wark, Sammy Lee and Craig Johnston, nobody could claim this was a collection of <b>top-notch</b> operators in the manner, say, of the current Real Madrid.
