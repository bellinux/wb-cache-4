500|$|Eventually, the Skinkers found {{a man in}} London {{willing to}} marry Tannakin. On {{the day of the}} wedding, and despite all efforts to improve her appearance, her face was as pig-like as ever. With the wedding service concluded, the newly-wed couple retired to the bedroom. When they lay in bed {{together}} for the first time, Tannakin reached for her husband's arm, saying that she would release him from his vows provided that he would look at her in the face. He <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and saw [...] "a sweet young Lady of incomparable beauty and feature, the like to whom to his imagination he never had in his whole life time beheld". He reached to kiss her, but she refused, saying: ...|$|E
60|$|This time he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> The old dagger {{was drawn}} in her.|$|E
60|$|Alora <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> father. He was filing {{his pipe}} and scowling more darkly than ever.|$|E
60|$|The Major gave an {{involuntary}} start, and then <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him curiously.|$|R
60|$|She <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Andre {{across the}} wide space that now {{separated}} them.|$|R
60|$|She <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Joe again. He {{was staring}} as blankly as ever.|$|R
60|$|He {{straightened}} his tie {{in front of}} the looking-glass and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with something like wonder in his eyes.|$|E
60|$|The sloop brought up, {{sheering}} {{to and fro}} in the eddying gusts. When Moran <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{he jumped}} up with an exclamation.|$|E
6000|$|The {{second act}} came, and she shrieked over the comic man; and her {{laughter}} rang higher than anyone else's, {{so that people}} <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and said: ...|$|E
60|$|Trot <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him, and {{her sweet}} face was grave and curious.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the newcomer, {{and saw the}} Lizard {{directly}} behind him.|$|R
60|$|A picador {{passes on}} horseback in his uncouth clothes, and all <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Micio! Micio!' called Hermione, in her slow, {{deliberate}} sing-song. The young cat <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> then, {{with his}} slow and stately walk he advanced to her side.|$|E
60|$|Thus Rosamund at last, startling {{the court}} with her crisp, sharp utterance. All <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> as she rose, and stood tall and {{compelling}} at the table's end.|$|E
60|$|Soft {{though her}} voice was, there was passion quivering in every sentence. When I <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{her eyes and}} face seemed aflame with it. The color had {{streamed}} into her cheeks, she had drifted into my arms, and her clinging lips yielded unresistingly to mine.|$|E
60|$|In sheer amazement M. Binet {{checked in}} his stride, and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his companion.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} the prince <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his sister. She was gazing earnestly into his face.|$|R
60|$|She neither <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him nor spoke. No ghost or {{stranger}} {{could have}} passed more silently.|$|R
60|$|But on the {{threshold}} she paused. Milor was sitting at a gigantic escritoire placed squarely {{in front of the}} window. He had obviously been writing; at the slight sound of the creaking door and the swish of Lydie's skirts, he raised his head from his work and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> She {{was dressed}} in black, was {{apparently}} rather small and slight, beneath her long black cloak, and she wore a black bonnet. She walked hastily, as if unseeing, her head rather forward. It was her curious, absorbed, flitting motion, {{as if she were}} passing unseen by everybody, that first arrested him.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{carriage}} that, thus released, eventually drew {{up before the}} superior public edifice known as the City Hall. From it a woman, closely veiled, alighted, and quickly entered the building. A few passers-by <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> partly from the rarity of the female figure at that period, and partly from the greater rarity of its being well formed and even ladylike.|$|E
60|$|He {{gripped his}} knees and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me again. For half a minute, perhaps, he stared silently.|$|R
60|$|Receiver <b>to</b> ear, he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Paula. Graham, {{bending over}} her but not {{touching}} her, met his eyes.|$|R
60|$|Sam {{walked slowly}} to the bow. As he did this, Wingate <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him in a {{speculative}} way.|$|R
60|$|His {{pleasure}} of possession was increased when people <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{on the street}} or in the dining room--to think that this remarkable creature was in reality his wife! Nor did the feeling grow less intense with time, being quite the same when they arrived at a fashionable resort in the Virginia mountains, on their way to New York. For such were the exactions of his calling that he could spare but two weeks for his honeymoon.|$|E
60|$|Nan was a {{handsome}} girl, with a fresh colour, clear eye, quick smile, and the self-poised look young women with a purpose always have. She was simply and sensibly dressed, walked easily, and seemed full of vigour, with her broad shoulders well back, arms swinging freely, and the elasticity of youth and health in every motion. The few people she met <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{as if it was}} a pleasant sight to see a hearty, happy girl walking countryward that lovely day; and the red-faced young man steaming along behind, hat off and every tight curl wagging with impatience, evidently agreed with them.|$|E
60|$|She herself became {{suddenly}} serious. She {{looked straight}} ahead down the darkening lane. Fate could surely not play her a trick so scurvy as this. It {{could not be}} that she cared. Her hands were suddenly clenched; a little cry broke from her lips. Her heart was beating like a girl's; the delicious thrill of youth seemed to be thawing her long frozen blood. Not again! she prayed, not again! It was a catastrophe this; grotesque, impossible! She thrust out her hands, as though to guard herself from some impending danger. Macheson <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in surprise, {{and her eyes were}} glowing like stars.|$|E
60|$|James {{shrugged his}} shoulders, and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Mary, who was coming towards him with letters in her hand.|$|R
60|$|James <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his uncle, noting {{a little}} contemptuously {{the change of}} his costume, and its extravagant juvenility.|$|R
60|$|They <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the bird, which fluttered {{its wings}} and {{stared back at}} them with its big eyes.|$|R
60|$|The workman's {{family was}} still waiting, and Maude handed the child a {{shilling}} {{as she went}} out. She was so happy herself that she wanted every one else to be happy also. The people <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> as she passed. With the slight flush upon her cheeks and the light in her eyes, she seemed the personification of youth, and life, and love. One tall old gentleman started as he looked, and watched her with a rapt face until she disappeared. Some cheek had flushed and some eye had brightened at his words once, and sweet old days had for an instant lived again.|$|E
60|$|He took {{and pressed}} it; speak he could not. Then, {{like a man}} {{stricken}} in years, he passed down the church with bent head and shambling feet. At the door he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> She was standing erect and proud as a conqueror, her hand resting upon the altar. Even at that distance their eyes met, and in hers, lit with a wild and sudden ray from the sinking sun, {{he could see a}} strange light shine. Then he went out of the door and dragged it to behind him, to battle his way homeward through the roaring gale that stung and buffeted him like all the gathered spites and hammerings of Destiny.|$|E
60|$|As usual she was marvellously dressed, {{a stately}} {{glittering}} {{figure in a}} gown of shimmering black which seemed at every moment on fire. Her beautiful neck and shoulders were uncovered and undecorated; she walked between a grey-headed man, who wore the orders of an ambassador and a blue sash on his evening clothes, and his wife. Every one <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> every one was watching when she {{stopped for a moment}} before Drexley's table, but every one did not see the flash in her eyes and the sudden tightening of her lips as she recognised the little party. Yet she was graciousness itself to them, and Douglas {{was the only one who}} noticed that first impulse of displeasure. She rested her fingers almost affectionately on Drexley's shoulder, and the new flush of colour in his cheeks faded into sallowness at her touch.|$|E
60|$|But when Boabdil was {{crossing}} the mountains he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the city he had lost, {{and burst into}} tears.|$|R
50|$|The {{project is}} now <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a more {{permanent}} station within Corwen, with permanent facilities, and a run round loop.|$|R
60|$|Bub gave a gasp. He came {{up beside}} her {{and stared at the}} money. Then he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Sarah Judd.|$|R
