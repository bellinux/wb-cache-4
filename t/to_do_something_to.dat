5|$|During the Crimean campaign, Manstein was {{indirectly}} {{involved in}} atrocities against the Soviet population, especially those committed by Einsatzgruppe D, {{one of several}} Schutzstaffel (SS) groups that had been tasked with {{the elimination of the}} Jews of Europe. Einsatzgruppe D travelled in the wake of Manstein's 11th Army, and were provided by Manstein's command with vehicles, fuel, and drivers. Military police cordoned off areas where the Einsatzgruppe planned to shoot Jews to prevent anyone from escaping. Captain Ulrich Gunzert, shocked to have witnessed Einsatzgruppe D massacre a group of Jewish women and children, went to Manstein to ask him <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> stop the killings. Gunzert states that Manstein told him to forget what he had seen and to concentrate on fighting the Red Army. Eleven of the seventeen charges against Manstein at his later war crimes trial were related to Nazi maltreatment and killing of Jews and prisoners of war in the Crimea.|$|E
5|$|Sandy, Patrick, and Squidward {{arrive at}} a gas station and from reading a {{newspaper}} article, discover SpongeBob's appointment as mayor of New Kelp City. But when they go to New Kelp City to retrieve him, SpongeBob cannot remember who they are. Squidward hi-jinks SpongeBob's limousine and gets away from the city with SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy in tow and they return to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob still does not recall the eatery and wants to return to New Kelp City to resume his job as mayor. Delighted that SpongeBob is leaving again, Squidward requests for his jewel encrusted egg but slips and accidentally throws the egg onto SpongeBob's head, which causes his memory to come back. Patrick, Sandy and Mr. Krabs apologize to SpongeBob for selfishly running him out of Bikini Bottom and are happy to have him back. But even so, SpongeBob still wants to return to New Kelp City. He changes his mind after a breaking news report comes on, saying that the bubbles in New Kelp City are blinding the citizens, and a thug threatens <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> SpongeBob if he ever comes back. SpongeBob starts cooking Krabby Patties again, much to his friends' delight. With a sigh of happiness, SpongeBob says that it looks like he will be back in Bikini Bottom. Upon hearing this, Squidward takes out his brain and drops it in a trash can.|$|E

Many of these worked in the American garment trades, manufacturing clothing and participating in a burgeoning New York City-based trade union movement in such unions as the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA) and the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU). Not only was there pressure from the rank-and-file below <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> aid the embattled Soviet regime, but many union officials were themselves radically-minded immigrants to America who had departed Tsarist Russia some years previously with a strong interest in lending aid to the so-called proletarian dictatorship in Soviet Russia.|$|E

25|$|After {{the battle}} of Ripple Field (13 April 1643) and his defeat by Prince Maurice, Sir William Waller retreated to Tewkesbury, and on to Gloucester. When there he found orders {{to go to his}} {{headquarters}} which were located in Bristol. This he delayed to do, the historian J.W. Willis-Bund stated that Waller was probably thinking it was necessary <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> maintain his reputation as there was no love lost between him and Essex. His bad luck in the operations against Maurice rendered it necessary for him to achieve something really brilliant before he returned to Bristol. He accordingly did not obey his orders, stating it would not be safe for him to leave Gloucester until Hereford and Worcester were reduced. He, therefore, set to work to carry out this out.|$|E

During Hitoshi Sora's first biology lesson at school, Ayuki commented that he leads a most intriguing class, referring to the genetically modified sunflowers he engineered which also turned out to be rather harmful. When Hitoshi tells Hazumu friends that she only has one month left to live, Ayuki reveals that she knew he was the space alien this entire time, due to his vast knowledge of science. Unlike her usual self which is calm and generally quiet, Ayuki gets very upset by this news, and pleads Hitoshi <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> keep Hazumu alive since he once before brought her back from the dead, eventually leading to Ayuki starting to cry. Hitoshi corrects her that his species is not omnipotent and while his people may be more advanced technologically, they are still inferior as a race compared to humans of Earth. After Ayuki learns that Hitoshi will remain on Earth for the next 100 years, she expresses interest in becoming a human collaborator in his observations of love.|$|E

When they arrive, WindClan queen Gorsetail's kits (Sedgekit, Thistlekit and Swallowkit) are missing and WindClan blames RiverClan, saying {{that there will be a}} battle if RiverClan does not return the kits. Jaypaw and Leafpool return to camp and Lionpaw tells his brother and sister about the tunnels, where he thinks the kits may have gone. They enter the caves, coincidentally meeting up with the WindClan apprentices Breezepaw and Heatherpaw, who share their motive for being there. Jaypaw is guided by the spirit of Fallen Leaves and the group finds the kits behind a boulder that blocked the tunnel. It starts raining and the tunnel floods, but Jaypaw figures a way out just in time and they return the kits, saving the Clans from an unnecessary battle. So Breezepaw, Heatherpaw, Jaypaw, Lionpaw, and Hollypaw return the kits back to WindClan and avert the battle. Then, once again, Lionpaw and Heatherpaw meet up again. They both talk about the future and how they want things to go.|$|E

25|$|Arthur's lack of {{employment}} becomes {{a huge problem}} for him in 1986 when his daughter, Michelle, announces her engagement to Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt). Desperate to give his daughter a wedding that the family can be proud of, Arthur decides to take money from the Walford residents' Christmas Club savings scheme {{that he has been}} running. However, with Christmas fast approaching, Arthur realises that he will have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> explain the lack of money in the account to everyone that contributed. Arthur announces to the members that he has withdrawn the money, then stages a fake burglary at his house and tells the police that the Christmas Club money has been stolen. However, Arthur's attempts to make the robbery look legitimate fail, and the police soon realise that Arthur is the culprit. When questioned by the police, he confesses and after his arrest he becomes severely morose, withdrawn and depressed. This culminates in Arthur finally having a nervous breakdown on Christmas Day and smashing his living room in a violent rage. By early 1987, Arthur has become so despondent that he is admitted to hospital. He returns the following spring to stand trial for the theft of the Christmas Club money. Despite Arthur having the whole community behind him, he is sent to prison for 28 days. After his release, he makes things worse by borrowing money from a loan shark.|$|E
25|$|England {{obviously}} needed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{maintain their}} {{hold on the}} Ashes and three changes {{were made to the}} team. The first was forced as Godfrey Evans had broken his middle finger and the reserve wicket-keeper Roy Swetman made his Test debut. This was not so much of a loss as first thought, Evans had not batted well for some years and Swetman had impressed behind the stumps throughout the tour and his batting had improved beyond all hopes. Peter Richardson had failed repeatedly as an opening batsman in the Tests and was replaced by his old opening partner Arthur Milton, even though he had broken his finger at Christmas. Willie Watson was dropped in favour of the newly arrived Cambridge and Sussex batsman Ted Dexter, who was also a more than useful swing bowler. May also had his final trump card, the fast bowler Fred Trueman, who had been ill at Brisbane and left out at Melbourne. He is widely considered to be England's greatest fast bowler and with good reason; he was the first man to take 300 wickets in Tests—307 at (21.57)—had tremendous stamina and bowled with a near perfect side on action that produced late swing at high pace. He was full of confidence and believed that he could get any batsman out on any wicket. Australia made changes as well, dropping Lindsay Kline who had taken 0/77 in two Tests and Bobby Simpson who had made a duck but was retained as twelfth man for his fielding. Instead they brought in the dual purpose fast-medium seamer and off-spinner Keith Slater, who had been twelfth man in the Second Test, but who had been accused of throwing by the MCC and Keith Miller. Mel McInnes kept his place as umpire even though Peter May and Freddie Brown had pointedly asked if it was necessary for him to officiate in all the Tests.|$|E

500|$|On 9 June the Allies held {{a conference}} in London to examine the reasons behind the quick {{surrender}} of Fort Rupel and favored a complete demobilization of the Greek army and navy.

The tension between the royal government and the Allies continued since 'anti-Allied activities' in Athens were ignored by the Greek Government. On 12–13 June, a mob destroyed Venizelist newspapers: Nea Ellas, Patris, Ethnos, and Estia. The mob proceeded to the British Embassy as police idly stood by without interfering. This incident gave France the political ammunition to persuade Britain that more extreme measures were needed.

500|$|... "You're Killing Me", {{the longest}} {{song on the}} EP at three minutes and 20 seconds, {{is an example of}} the impact punk rock had on Pavement.

[...] "Box Elder", an ironic song about someone wanting to move to Box Elder, Montana, was considered by Gerard Cosloy to be an example of Malkmus's [...] "honest, direct, and simplistic" [...] lyrical style, and features greater influence from pop music than the rest of the EP. [...] "Maybe Maybe" [...] features distorted guitars and indiscernible vocals, and [...] "Price Yeah!" [...] has a sound typical of hardcore punk. The band's hometown of Stockton inspired the band's lyrics and sound. Malkmus stated that [...] "There's something empty about Stockton. I wanted to convey that in our music."

[...] The band purposely wanted a raw sound on the album so that Rock did not polish the sound while mixing.

Rock commented, [...] "I wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> shake up radio and the way everything else sounds. To me, this album sounds like four guys in a garage getting together and writing rock songs. There was really no time to get amazing performances out of James. We liked the raw performances.

In addition to the collections of poetry already mentioned, he has published two volumes of poetry for children called Child's Delight (1972), and another collection called Friend: Poems (2003).
