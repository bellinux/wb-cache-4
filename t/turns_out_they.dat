500|$|... "Summer Catalog" [...] is the 20th {{episode of}} the second season of the American comedy {{television}} series Parks and Recreation, and the 26th overall {{episode of the}} series. It originally aired on NBC in the United States on March 25, 2010. In the episode, Leslie organizes a reunion with the last four Pawnee park directors, but is disappointed when it <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>they</b> despise each other. Meanwhile, Tom tries to take a photo of Ann and Mark for the city's summer catalog, while the budding relationship of Andy and April continues to develop.|$|E
500|$|In {{a parody}} of Transformers, Bart buys Lisa a Malibu Stacy {{convertible}} as a Christmas present. However, the car {{turns out to be}} a Transformer. The robot transforms all of the technology in Springfield into robots so they can wage war with each other. Just as the two machine factions' leaders prepare to face off, Marge asks why the robots are at war with one another; as it <b>turns</b> <b>out,</b> <b>they</b> cannot even remember. Thanking Marge, the two sides declare that they will work together, only for one of the leading robots to shout [...] "and now that we are not fighting each other, we can team up to enslave [...] your planet!" [...] The two factions of sentient machines work together to overthrow humanity and use Springfield's residents in a game of human foosball.|$|E
500|$|Lytle later noted, [...] "It was {{actually}} Jim 's fault. He {{suggested that we}} consider playing some shows, and I went, 'No', [...] he convinced me {{it might be a}} good idea. We talked about it for a little while. I didn't think anyone else in the band would be into it, [...] he checked around and it <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>they</b> were all enthusiastic. I think I was the last one to say yes.... I {{was actually}} blown away that they even wanted to. Once I found that out, I said 'OK, let's start doing the work, figure out how to play the songs.' The weird moment was when he had the first rehearsal; I had no idea how it was going to turn out. After five days of playing together it actually sounded really good. It was too easy, and we were actually really having a good time together." ...|$|E

500|$|On 1 January 2006, Tew {{announced}} {{that because the}} demand was so great for the last 1,000 pixels, [...] "the most fair and logical thing" [...] to do was auction them on eBay rather than lose [...] "the integrity and degree of exclusivity intrinsic to the million-pixel concept" [...] by launching a second Million Dollar Homepage. The auction lasted ten days and received 99 legitimate bids. Although bids were received for amounts as high as $160,109.99, many were either retracted by the bidders or cancelled as hoaxes. [...] "I actually contacted the people by phone and <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>they</b> weren't serious, which is fairly frustrating, so I removed those bidders at the last minute", said Tew. The winning bid was $38,100, placed by MillionDollarWeightLoss.com, an online store selling diet-related products. Tew remarked that he had expected the final bid amount to be higher due to the media attention. The Million Dollar Homepage made a gross total of $1,037,100 in five months. After costs, taxes and a donation to The Prince's Trust, a charity for young people, Tew expected his net income to be $650,000–$700,000.|$|E
500|$|To {{accommodate}} the video production, {{the equivalent of}} a television studio control room—costing US$3.5million—was built for the tour. Beneath the stage, Dodds, the video director, operated a system custom-built by Philips called CD-i. It used fivebroadcast camera systems, 12Laser Disc players, and a satellite dish, and it required 12directors, 19video crew members, and two separate mix stations to operate. To enable each band member to perform away from their personal monitor speakers on the main stage, sound engineers used joysticks to control a panning matrix for each member's in-ear monitor as they moved around. Despite the production's complexity, the group decided that flexibility in the shows' length and content was a priority. Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "That was one of the more important decisions we made early on, that we wouldn't sacrifice flexibility, so we designed a system that is both extremely complicated and high-tech but also incredibly simple and hands-on, controlled by human beings... in that sense, it's still a live performance." [...] This flexibility allowed for improvisations and deviations from the planned programme. Eno recommended that U2 film its own video tapes so that they could be edited and looped into the video displays more easily, instead of relying entirely on pre-sequenced video. Eno explained, [...] "their show depends on some kind of response to what's happening at the moment in that place. So if it <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>they</b> want to do a song for five minutes longer, they can actually loop through the material again so that you're not suddenly stuck with black screens halfway through the fifth verse." [...] The band shot new video for the displays {{over the course of the}} tour.|$|E
2500|$|Length {{contraction}} has {{an effect}} on charge density [...] and current density , and time dilation {{has an effect}} on the rate of flow of charge (current), so charge and current distributions must transform in a related way under a boost.

5000|$|On the covers, Palmieri remarked, [...] "I {{was really}} pleased {{with how the}} covers <b>turned</b> <b>out.</b> <b>They</b> were simple, elegant, {{conveyed}} just the right mood, and were completely unlike anything we'd done up to that point." ...|$|R

2500|$|His son, Fred, {{turns out}} to be a similar character. In the {{following}} scene from Act III, Fred has already agreed to break things off with Eve. She and her mother have arrived, and his father is about to confront Mrs. Van Brugh with evidence of her impropriety with Captain Van Brugh, which he presumes to be bigamy, although it <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>they</b> never married in the first place. In the meantime, Fred takes Eve to the garden: ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{proposed}} classification {{has tried}} to integrate the results of recent molecular work by using unranked clades for taxa below the traditional rank of class (class Gastropoda) but above the rank of superfamily (replacing the ranks subclass, superorder, order, and suborder), while still using the traditional Linnaean ranks for superfamilies and all taxa below the rank of superfamily (i.e., family, subfamily, tribe, genus, subgenus, and species. The clades have been given names which are similar to, {{or in some cases}} the same as, traditional Linnaean names for taxa above the level of superfamily. Whenever monophyly (a single ancestry) has not yet been tested and confirmed, or where a traditional taxon of gastropods has already been discovered to be [...] paraphyletic (that it excludes some of its descendants) the term [...] "group" [...] or [...] "informal group" [...] has been used. Both Linnaean taxa and clades are invalid if it <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>they</b> are polyphyletic, in other words if they consist of more than one lineage.|$|E
2500|$|A briefly popular theory {{held that}} a 12C-rich comet struck the earth and {{initiated}} the warming event. A cometary impact coincident with the P/E boundary can also help explain some enigmatic features associated with this event, such as the iridium anomaly at Zumaia, the abrupt appearance of kaolinitic clays with abundant magnetic nanoparticles on the coastal shelf of New Jersey, and especially the nearly simultaneous onset of the carbon isotope excursion and the thermal maximum. Indeed, a key feature and testable prediction of a comet impact is that it should produce virtually instantaneous environmental effects in the atmosphere and surface ocean with later repercussions in the deeper ocean. Even allowing for feedback processes, this would require at least 100 gigatons of extraterrestrial carbon. Such a catastrophic impact should have left its mark on the globe. Unfortunately, the evidence put forward does not stand up to scrutiny. An unusual 9-meter-thick clay layer supposedly formed soon after the impact, containing unusual amounts of magnetite, but it formed too slowly for these magnetic particles {{to have been a}} result of the comet's impact. and it <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>they</b> were created by bacteria. [...] However, recent analyses have shown that isolated particles of non-biogenic origin make up the majority of the magnetic particles in the thick clay unit.|$|E

50|$|Parliamentary {{elections}} {{were held in}} the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes on 11 September 1927. The People's Radical Party remained the largest faction in Parliament, winning 112 of the 315 seats.

6000|$|The French, as was intimated, are {{in great}} vigor, this Year; {{thoroughly}} provoked; and especially since Friedrich sent his Rothenburg among them, {{have been doing}} their very utmost. Their main effort is in the Netherlands, at present;--and indeed, as happened, continues all through this War to be. They by no means intend, or ever did, to neglect Teutschland; yet it <b>turns</b> <b>out,</b> <b>they</b> have pretty much done with their fighting there. And next Year, driven or led by accidents of various kinds, they quit it altogether; and turning their whole strength upon the Netherlands and Italy, chiefly on the Netherlands, leave Friedrich, much to his astonishment, with the German War hanging wholly round HIS neck, and take no charge of it farther! In which, to Friedrich's Biographers, there is this inestimable benefit, if far the reverse to Friedrich's self: That we shall soon have done with the French, then; with them and with so much else; and may, in time coming, for most part, leave their huge Sorcerer's Sabbath of a European War to dance itself out, well in the distance, not encumbering us farther, like a circumambient Bedlam, as it has hitherto done. Courage, reader! Let us give, in a glance or two, some notion of the course things took, and what moment it was when Friedrich struck in;--whom alone, or almost alone, we hope to follow thenceforth; [...] "Dismal Swamp" [...] (so gracious was Heaven to us) lying now mostly to rearward, little as we hoped it! ...|$|E
