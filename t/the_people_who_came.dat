25|$|Novi Sad is {{the second}} largest city in Serbia (after Belgrade), and the largest city in Vojvodina. Since its founding, the {{population}} of the city has been constantly increasing.

25|$|Emma, Hook {{and their}} guest return to see Rumplestiltskin {{in the hopes}} that he can open the time portal, but instead he tells them that only they can re-open it because only <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>came</b> through the portal can re-open it, but they need to wield magic. Rumple gives Emma a wand and tells her to open the portal if she has magic, but she doesn't think she can. Rumple decides he’d rather forget {{everything}} he’s learned so as not to alter his future, then he sends Emma and Hook to a dark vault where he keeps dangerous and unpredictable magic, where their Storybrooke outfits are restored. Hook says that Emma still has some magic in her and after seeing what happened to her parents and realizing everything Henry did to bring her to Storybrooke, she's ready to return home. Hook and Emma then notice the wand lights up with magic and open up the portal, allowing Hook and the woman to escape first. Before she can leave, Rumple holds on to Emma and demands to know what happened to Baelfire/Neal. Emma tells him what happened, then she begs him not to take away the fact he died a hero. Rumplestiltskin drinks the forgetting potion and lets go of Emma where she is pulled into the portal, which sends her, Hook, and the woman back to Storybrooke.|$|E

500|$|The {{process server}} {{tried unsuccessfully to}} serve the notices the {{following}} day. News soon spread to the nearby Ballinrobe, from where many people descended on Lough Mask House, where, according to journalist James Redpath, they advised Boycott's servants and labourers to leave his employment immediately. Boycott said {{that many of his}} servants were forced to leave [...] "...under threat of ulterior consequences." [...] Martin Branigan, a labourer who subsequently sued Boycott for non-payment of wages, claimed he left because he was afraid of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>came</b> into the field where he was working. Eventually, all Boycott's employees left, forcing him to run the estate without help.|$|E
500|$|The Laborers International Union {{represented}} {{the bulk of}} the less-skilled labor on the project. Laborers, as they were commonly known, did most of the odd jobs on the project: digging trenches in areas inaccessible by heavy equipment, drilling holes for the pipeline's Vertical Support Members, spreading gravel, crushing rock, and moving supplies by hand. Laborers Local 942 out of Fairbanks was the most prominent Laborers group on the project, and because no special skills were required for the jobs it filled, the Laborers Union attracted most of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>came</b> to Alaska specifically for the pipeline project.

500|$|Another {{method of}} {{peaceful}} protesting was {{demonstrated in the}} formation of Camp Solidarity which was located {{in the center of the}} protesting, in southern Virginia. Supporters came from all over the country to show their outrage against the actions of Pittston but there was no place that they could stay. Although many people in the local towns would offer shelter, they could not provide enough beds and food for all <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>came.</b> Union member supporters found a solution to the problem. [...] A local recreational park near Castlewood, Virginia was turned into a campground where these supporters could stay. A small shelter equipped with bunk beds was built and an already existing snack bar was opened to provide food for the people staying at Camp Solidarity. Because the location was a recreational park, there was plenty of space for others to bring campers and tents into the area.|$|E

500|$|Halfway {{through the}} school year, Ali's family moves to the more {{peaceful}} Kurdish region in Northern Iraq but after living there for several months, Ali {{says that he is}} homesick and misses the action and noise of Baghdad. Mohammad, feeling lonely, [...] "adopts" [...] a bird with a broken wing and a mouse he finds in the house. This brings him some comfort, but his mother later demands that he get rid of the mouse as she does not want [...] "vermin" [...] in the house. Mohammad's family rejoice when Saddam Hussein is sentenced, and feel that his later execution was justified, as to do otherwise would have made the Iraqi people look weak. Conversely, Anmar's family is upset at his execution, as they feel that <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>came</b> into power were no better than Hussein was. Hyder's mother says that many Iraqi people were hopeful about the arrival of American forces, and that it is wrong to blame America for all of the problems in Iraq. She notes that the bloodshed has yet to stop as the Sunni continues to kill the Shiite, and vice versa. As the film continues, Hyder's family loses its income and they start to sell their furniture to earn extra money.|$|E
500|$|My Bloody Valentine were {{scheduled}} to record at Blackwing Studios in Southwark, London {{for the month of}} February 1989, and intended to use the time to conceptualise a new, more studio-based sound for their second album. Shields said that Creation first believed the album could be recorded [...] "in five days". According to Shields [...] "when it became clear that wasn't going to happen, they [...] freaked." [...] After several unproductive months, the band relocated in September to the basement studio The Elephant and Wapping, where they spent eight unproductive weeks. In-house engineer Nick Robbins said Shields made it clear from the outset that he (Robbins) [...] "was just there to press the buttons." [...] Robbins was quickly replaced by Harold Burgon, but according to Shields, Burgon's main contribution was to show the group how to use the in-studio computer. Burgon and Shields spent three weeks at the Woodcray studio in Berkshire working on the Glider EP, which Shields and Creation owner Alan McGee agreed would be released in advance of the album. Alan Moulder was hired to mix the Glider song [...] "Soon" [...] at Trident 2 studio in Victoria (the song would reappear as the closing track on Loveless). Shields said of Moulder, [...] "As soon as we worked with him we realized we'd love to some more!" [...] When the group returned to work on the album Moulder was the sole engineer Shields trusted enough to perform tasks such as miking the amplifiers; all the other credited engineers were told [...] "We're so on top of this you don't even have to come to work." [...] Shields has since stated that [...] "these engineers—with the exception of Alan Moulder and later Anjali Dutt—were all just <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>came</b> with the studio...everything we wanted to do was wrong, according to them", although the band did give credit on the album sleeve to anyone who was present during the recordings, [...] "even if all they did was fix tea", according to Shields.|$|E
500|$|On 21 October, {{soldiers}} again attacked an army {{barracks in}} what the New York Times said was a coup attempt against the interim government. It also cited the arrest of an unnamed dissident army captain on 27 October as the organiser of the countercoup attempt and reported that two other unnamed government critics were assaulted and left outside Bissau. Army Chief of Staff General Antonio Indjai laughed off questions {{that he was the}} power behind the throne and responded to the criticism in saying: [...] "People say I’m a drug trafficker. Anybody who has the proof, present it! We ask the international community to give us the means to fight drugs." [...] Gonzalez-Ducay then responded: [...] "I can't believe that the one who controls the drug trafficking is going to fight the drug trafficking." [...] The U.S. State Department's Foreign Service Officer for Guinea-Bissau Russell Hanks, who is not present in the country following the U.S. shutting its embassy during the Bissau-Guinean Civil War in 1998, said: [...] "You will only have an impact on this transition by engagement, not by isolation. These are <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>came</b> in {{to pick up the pieces}} after the coup." [...] His staff pointed to photographs of newly created stretches of road in a remote rural area near the Senegal border that had space for small planes to land and they suggested was under the supervision of the armed forces. Chief of Guinea-Bissau's judicial police João Biague reported on a dubious aircraft landing months before the coup near Indjai's farm. He also added that [...] "The traffickers know [...] can't do much. The agents we have in the field want to give up because they have nothing to eat." [...] Guinea-Bissau's former prosecutor general added: [...] "A country that’s not capable of discussing its own problems — it's not a country, it's not a state." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many of Guiteau's contemporaries {{believed}} that he was seriously deranged, and [...] "I am Going to the Lordy" [...] helped exemplify their point.
