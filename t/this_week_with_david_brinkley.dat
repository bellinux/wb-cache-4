However, this time {{he noted that the}} idea was unlikely, as the Soviets feared that organizing such an event might prompt the International Olympic Committee to exclude the USSR. On the same day, Soviet sports commentator Vsevold Kuskuskin, during an interview for ABC television program <b>This</b> <b>Week</b> <b>with</b> <b>David</b> <b>Brinkley,</b> said the Eastern Bloc would definitely not organize such games. Also on 13 May, Laos, Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan announced their decision to boycott the Los Angeles games.|$|E

500|$|On the {{subsequent}} Born in the U.S.A. Tour, Springsteen generally interspersed hard-rocking song sequences after {{every three or}} four numbers in order to give Weinberg's hands a chance to recover. Weinberg's wife Becky unintentionally triggered one of the tour's most celebrated episodes. She was a fan of the <b>This</b> <b>Week</b> <b>with</b> <b>David</b> <b>Brinkley</b> television program and invited panelist George Will to the Washington-area Capital Centre show. After seeing the band perform, Will became convinced that they were exemplars of hard-working patriotism and traditional American values; he wrote, [...] "... consider Max Weinberg's bandaged fingers. [...] The rigors of drumming have led to five tendonitis operations. He soaks his hands in hot water before a concert, in ice afterward, and sleeps with tight gloves on." [...] Will further decided that Springsteen might endorse Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential campaign and talked to the campaign, which later led to Reagan's famous extolling of Springsteen at a stop in Hammonton, New Jersey and Springsteen's subsequent negative response.|$|E

5000|$|Week 4 - Elise & Teneale (3-2): During this elimination, it was {{revealed}} that there was a secret alliance (called [...] "the Firm") that had been in play since week 1. The Firm alliance consisted of 5 couples: Wayne & Geoff, Rick & Joe, David & Phil, Caitlin & Daina, and Elise & Teneale. As Wayne's new partner, Phoebe became a part of the Firm. The Firm's goal was to get all of them to the final 10. One of the rules of the Firm was that if two Firm couples were to fall below the yellow line, the couple with the lowest percentage weight loss would be voted out. As it turned out, this situation occurred <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>with</b> <b>David</b> & Phil and Elise & Teneale both below the yellow line. Caitlin & Daina were conflicted because even though the Firm's rules stated they should vote out Elise & Teneale as they had the lowest percentage weight loss, they felt a bond with them. The votes from the other couples were split evenly, so Caitlin & Daina had the deciding vote. In the end, they followed the Firm's rule and voted out Elise & Teneale.|$|R
5000|$|The IRC {{has been}} {{responding}} to Syria's refugee crisis. On the ABC News programme of 13 October 2013, <b>This</b> <b>Week</b> <b>with</b> George Stephanopoulos, <b>David</b> Miliband commented that {{he worried about}} the immediate effects of the current diplomatic solution in Syria of sending in Chemical Weapons Inspectors and destroying the chemical stockpiles {{would have on the}} ongoing crisis. He said: [...] "We’re concerned that people think that somehow, because the chemical weapons seem to be addressed, that the Syrian conflict, the regional conflict, is done and dusted.” On 10 October 2013, David Miliband said there were huge risks in not intervening militarily. [...] "We've got people on the ground, not just in Syria but in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq,” he told a foreign policy discussion in Manhattan. “I’ve got people who are in danger.” He quoted Frederick the Great, saying: “Diplomacy without weapons is like music without instruments”. His policy opinions were at odds with his younger brother, Ed Miliband, the Labour Party's Leader in the UK who insisted that the Labour Party will not back military intervention.|$|R
