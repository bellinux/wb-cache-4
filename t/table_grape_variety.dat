50|$|Madeleine x Angevine 7672 found favour {{with many}} of the early UK growers and it became fairly widespread. At one time it was the third most popular variety (after MT and Seyval blanc) and Gillian Pearkes, in the West Country, thought highly of it. Unfortunately, owing to the {{confusion}} over the name and the fact that this variety was not available from any other source other than Brock’s original stock or vineyards planted with vines obtained from Brock, some growers were sold vines of the true <b>table</b> <b>grape</b> <b>variety</b> Madeleine Angevine, which was barely suitable for the UK, except in the very best years.
