5|$|Light {{infantry}} were equipped more lightly <b>than</b> <b>regular</b> line regiments, {{and marched}} at 140 paces per minute. Tasks {{of the light}} infantry included advance and rear guard action, flanking protection for armies and forward skirmishing. They were also called upon to take regular line formations during battles, or to act as part of fortification storming parties. During the Peninsular War they were regarded as the army's elite corps.|$|E

5|$|The theologian Sallie McFague {{believes}} that the more recent problem of religious language is based on individual experience, owing to the increased secularisation of society. She notes that human experience is of this world rather <b>than</b> <b>regular</b> encounters with the divine, which makes the experience of God uncommon and potentially unnecessary. Because of this, she argues, religious language is both idolatrous because it fails to express sufficient awe of God, and irrelevant because without adequate words it becomes meaningless.|$|E
5|$|A {{conservative}} Washington D.C. think tank, and a Republican {{member of}} Congress, among others, {{have claimed that}} Gore has a conflict-of-interest for advocating for taxpayer subsidies of green-energy technologies {{in which he has}} a personal investment. Additionally, he has been criticized for his above-average energy consumption in using private jets, and in owning multiple, very large homes, one of which was reported in 2007 as using high amounts of electricity. Gore's spokesperson responded by stating that the Gores use renewable energy which is more expensive <b>than</b> <b>regular</b> energy and that the Tennessee house in question has been retrofitted to make it more energy-efficient.|$|E
5|$|Continual {{growth and}} outside {{investments}} {{during these years}} allowed the company to expand and grow: Odwalla's revenue tripled from 1994 to 1995, and in 1996 they made more than $59million in sales, their highest ever. This constant growth made Odwalla {{one of the largest}} fresh-juice companies in America by 1996, when the company was selling its products to stores in seven states and parts of Canada. It was estimated that they would reach $100million in sales by 1999. Much of this growth resulted from the perception that Odwalla's products were healthier <b>than</b> <b>regular</b> juice because of unpasteurization.|$|E

5|$|Discectomy (the partial {{removal of}} a disc that is causing leg pain) can provide pain relief sooner than nonsurgical treatments. Discectomy has better {{outcomes}} at one year but not at four to ten years. The less invasive microdiscectomy has not been shown {{to result in a}} different outcome <b>than</b> <b>regular</b> discectomy. For most other conditions, there is not enough evidence to provide recommendations for surgical options. The long-term effect surgery has on degenerative disc disease is not clear. Less invasive surgical options have improved recovery times, but evidence regarding effectiveness is insufficient.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{arrive at}} the port {{and talk to the}} owner of the dog Dr. Ian Detweiler (Andrew Robinson), a cryptozoologist. Detweiler says the dog is a Wanshang Dhole, a species thought to be extinct. The two agents soon receive news of the other attack and, after investigating, Mulder {{believes}} the Dhole has near-human intelligence. Mulder and Scully visit Berquist, who tells them that the breed they are looking for is extinct. Meanwhile, a dog catcher is chasing a stray through a warehouse when a man enters the building. He promptly transforms into the murderous dhole and attacks the catcher. Mulder and Scully soon {{arrive at the}} scene, followed by Berquist. She finds a paw print with five toes, one more <b>than</b> <b>regular</b> canines.|$|E
5|$|Risk is an {{essential}} element in the battle system. A Risk bar is placed below the HP and MP bar, representing the Risk Points the player has accumulated. Risk Points affect Ashley's concentration; the longer Ashley attacks a target, the more his Risk Point accumulates — lowering his accuracy and defenses. Chain and Defensive Abilities increase Risk faster <b>than</b> <b>regular</b> attacks, while Break Arts do not increase Risk at all. Enemy attacks and spells deal more damage if the player has high Risk. The advantage, however, is the higher chances for the player to score critical hits and restore higher HP.|$|E

5|$|The CPS men served without {{wages and}} minimal {{support from the}} federal government. The cost of {{maintaining}} the CPS camps and providing {{for the needs of}} the men was the responsibility of their congregations and families. CPS men served longer <b>than</b> <b>regular</b> draftees and were not released until well {{after the end of the}} war. Initially skeptical of the program, government agencies learned to appreciate the men's service and requested more workers from the program. CPS made significant contributions to forest fire prevention, erosion and flood control, medical science and reform of the mental health system.|$|E
5|$|The Sopranos {{was a major}} ratings success, {{despite being}} aired on premium cable network HBO which is {{available}} in significantly fewer American homes <b>than</b> <b>regular</b> networks. The show frequently attracted equal or larger audiences than most popular network shows of the time. Nielsen ratings {{for the first four}} seasons are not entirely accurate, however, as Nielsen reported aggregate numbers for cable networks prior to January 2004, meaning that people who were included in the ratings estimates were actually watching HBO channels other than the main one on which The Sopranos aired.|$|E
5|$|The Special Air Service (formally 22 Special Air Service Regiment, or 22 SAS) is a {{regiment}} of the British Army {{and part}} of the United Kingdom's special forces. The SAS was sporadically assigned to operations in Northern Ireland {{in the early stages of}} the British Army's deployment in the province, during which they were confined to South Armagh. The first large-scale deployment of SAS soldiers in the Troubles was in 1976, when the regiment's D Squadron was committed. The SAS soon began to specialise in covert, intelligence-based operations against the IRA, using more aggressive tactics <b>than</b> <b>regular</b> army and police units operating in Northern Ireland.|$|E

5|$|The {{game has}} a tension gauge, {{increasing}} when a character causes damage or moves toward an adversary and decreasing when a character moves backwards or is {{stopped for a}} long time. When the gauge is half-charged a player can use specials called Overdrive Attacks, which cause more damage <b>than</b> <b>regular</b> moves. A full gauge allows a player to make an Instant Kill, defeating an opponent regardless of health; if an Instant Kill is unsuccessful, the tension gauge will not charge {{for the remainder of}} that round.|$|E
5|$|A {{semi-arid}} desert or a steppe is {{a version}} of the arid desert with much more rainfall, vegetation and higher humidity. These regions feature a semi-arid climate and are less extreme <b>than</b> <b>regular</b> deserts. Like arid deserts, temperatures can vary greatly in semi deserts. They share some characteristics of a true desert and are usually located at the edge of deserts and continental dry areas. They usually receive precipitation from 250mm (10in) to 500mm (20in) but this can vary due to evapotranspiration and soil nutrition. Semi deserts {{can be found in the}} Tabernas Desert (and some of the Spanish Plateau), The Sahel, The Eurasian Steppe, most of Central Asia, the Western US, most of Northern Mexico, portions of South America (especially in Argentina) and the Australian Outback. They usually feature BSh (hot steppe) or BSk (temperate steppe) in the Köppen climate classification.|$|E
5|$|Between the wars, the reservists enjoyed {{much better}} {{promotion}} prospects. While Alan Vasey, {{a major in}} the First AIF, was not promoted {{to the rank of}} lieutenant colonel until 1937, Kenneth Eather, a reservist who was too young to serve in World War I, was commissioned in 1923 and promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1935. Menzies ordered that all commands in the 6th Division be given to reservists rather <b>than</b> <b>regular</b> officers, who had become political adversaries through their outspoken opposition to the Singapore strategy. Appointments therefore went to reservists like Stanley Savige, Arthur Allen, Leslie Morshead and Edmund Herring. Later other Militia officers rose to prominence as brigade and division commanders. The distinguished records of officers like Heathcote Hammer, Ivan Dougherty, David Whitehead, Victor Windeyer and Selwyn Porter would challenge the regular officers' contention that they had a special claim to senior command ability.|$|E

5|$|Each of the {{branches}} of the ADF has a reserve component. These forces are the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, Australian Army Reserve and Royal Australian Air Force Reserve. The main role of the reserves is to supplement the permanent elements of the ADF during deployments and crises, including natural disasters. This can include attaching individual reservists to regular units or deploying units composed entirely of reserve personnel. As reservists serve on a part-time basis, they are less costly to the government than permanent members of the ADF, but the nature of their service can mean that reservists have a lower level of readiness <b>than</b> <b>regular</b> personnel and require further training before they can be deployed. It has historically proven difficult to set a level of training requirements which allows reservists to be rapidly deployable yet does not act as a disincentive to recruitment and continued participation.|$|E
5|$|Fares for Metro {{light rail}} service {{are the same}} as those for most Metro Transit bus {{services}} and include unlimited transfers to other light rail and bus routes within 2.5 hours from the time a fare is paid. Two exceptions exist for Metro light rail services: fares within (but not between) downtown zones are less expensive <b>than</b> <b>regular</b> fares but may not be transferred; and there is no cost to ride between terminals 1 and 2 at the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport (MSP). Many stations connect with rail or bus routes. The Target Field station provides a connection to the Northstar commuter rail line, while the Mall of America station allows for transfers to the Metro Red Line bus rapid transit service. The A Line bus rapid transit line connects with the 46th Street Blue Line station and the Snelling Avenue Green Line stop. Two Metro light rail stations – 28th Avenue and Fort Snelling – have designated park and ride lots.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the pottery}} found in 9th century pueblos was sized for {{individuals}} or small families, but as communal ceremonialism expanded during the 13th century, many larger, feast–sized vessels were produced. Corrugated decorations appear on Mesa Verde grey wares after 700, and by 1000 entire vessels were crafted in this way. The technique created a rough exterior surface that {{was easier to}} hold on to <b>than</b> <b>regular</b> grey wares, which were smooth. By the 11th century these corrugated vessels, which dissipated heat more efficiently than smoother ones, had largely replaced the older style, whose tendency to retain heat made them prone to boiling over. Corrugation likely developed as ancient potters attempted to mimic the visual properties of coiled basketry. Corrugated wares were made using clay from formations other than Menefee, which suggests that ancient potters selected different clays for different styles. Potters also selected clays and altered firing conditions to achieve specific colors. Under normal conditions, pots made of Mancos shale turned grey when fired, and those made of Morrison Formation clay turned white. Clays from southeastern Utah turned red when fired in a high-oxygen environment.|$|E
