25|$|The Brooklyn Class was {{deployed}} with <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 34 {{director and}} later <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 3 radar. This would be upgraded to <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 8 {{and again to}} <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 13 radar. <b>The</b> secondary battery was controlled by <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 28 and upgraded to <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 33 fire control systems. The associated radars were <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 4 fire control radar and upgraded again to <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 12. Two anti-aircraft fire directors were fitted to each ship. A late World War 2 refit saw the Mk 51 director installed for the 40mm Bofors guns. Night engagements were improved when in 1945 <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 57 and 63 directors in installed.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> VI had 6 strings, <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> IX had 9, <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> XII had 12.|$|R
50|$|Released for the 1993 model year, <b>the</b> Lincoln <b>Mark</b> VIII {{continued}} <b>the</b> role of <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> VII as a luxury-oriented grand touring coupe. Slightly {{larger than}} its predecessor, <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> VIII was sized nearly halfway between <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> VI and <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> VII in length (with its wheelbase only an inch shorter than <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> VI coupe). Despite its larger footprint, the curb weight of <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> VIII remained {{essentially the same}} as its predecessor.|$|R
50|$|After {{having made}} {{plans for the}} {{continued}} development of <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> I into <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> IV, <b>the</b> Tank Supply Committee (the institute planning and controlling British tank production) in December 1916 ordered the design of two new types: <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> V and <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> VI. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> V should embody the most advanced features that could still be incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> I hull. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> VI should abandon the old hull entirely, reflecting only some general principles of the older tank.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Marks</b> I-VI had {{straight}} wings, whereas <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> VII introduced swept outer wings. Starting with <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> III <b>the</b> Virginia {{mounted a}} rear fuselage gunner, who was {{moved into a}} tail turret in <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> VII.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> 30 {{mine was}} an aircraft-launched, antisubmarine torpedo {{developed}} by the Brush Development Company during World War II. It was developed as a backup for <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 24 mine due to apprehensions regarding <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 24's acoustic steering. Three prototypes of <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 30 were built and tested in 1943; results were satisfactory. Production of <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 30 was never undertaken due {{to the success of}} <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 24 mine's acoustic steering.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} was slightly more luxurious than the Custom. The only component that was {{identical to the}} Custom were the tail lights. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> I Special was produced in 1963, {{and was replaced by}} <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> II in 1964. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> II was mostly the same as <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> I except for a redesigned dashboard, new grille design (gold Cedric Star emblem and separate gold letters spelling [...] "Special"), and rectangular reflectors below the tail lights (replacing the round reflectors used on <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> I). An automatic transmission, the Borg-Warner 35, became available starting with <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> II. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> II was produced in 1963 and 1964, and was replaced by <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> III Special in 1964. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> III featured a new grille and tail lights from the 1965 31 Series Cedric. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> III Cedric Special was replaced by the Nissan President in 1965.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> is an {{electric}} guitar made by Vox. The instrument {{is also known}} as the Vox Teardrop, {{but this is not the}} official name. <b>The</b> Vox <b>Mark</b> came in three variations, a 6 string (<b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> VI), a 9 string (<b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> IX) and a 12 string (<b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> XII) ...|$|R
50|$|Unlike its predecessor, <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 6, {{which was}} really just a {{facelift}} of <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 5, <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 7 was a new design.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> basic <b>Mark</b> 6 {{design was}} 61 in in {{diameter}} and 128 in long, the same basic dimensions as <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 4 and close to <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 3. Various models of <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 6 were roughly 25% lighter than either <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 4 or Fat Man, and weighed 7600 to(-) 8500 lb.|$|R
50|$|Introduced in 2004, <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> IV {{series of}} Disklaviers was {{available}} in grand pianos only. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> IV series overlapped <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> III model era.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> I was {{followed}} by <b>the</b> Harvard <b>Mark</b> II (1947 or 1948), Mark III/ADEC (September 1949), and Harvard Mark IV (1952) - all the work of Aiken. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> II was an improvement over <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> I, although it still was based on electromechanical relays. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> III used mostly electronic components—vacuum tubes and crystal diodes—but also included mechanical components: rotating magnetic drums for storage, plus relays for transferring data between drums. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> IV was all-electronic, replacing the remaining mechanical components with magnetic core memory. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> II and Mark III were delivered to the US Navy base at Dahlgren, Virginia. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> IV was built for the US Air Force, but it stayed at Harvard.|$|R
5000|$|Far more {{successful}} than <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> II or <b>the</b> 1958-1960 Continental <b>Marks,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> Series would be sold through <b>the</b> 1993-1998 <b>Mark</b> VIII.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> 10 torpedo had {{the same}} [...] "deep running" [...] problem (where actual running depth was greater than that set before launch) as <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 14. By January 5, 1942 the Bureau of Ordnance {{informed}} Commander, Submarines, Pacific Fleet <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 10 torpedoes ran four feet deeper than set. Because <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 10 used Mark 3-1 and Mark 3-3 exploder mechanism with contact-only firing, it suffered none {{of the problems with}} prematures <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 14 did. However, for a short period at the beginning of <b>the</b> war, <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 10 was viewed as more reliable, and in some cases preferred over <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 14.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> VI {{was one of}} a pair {{of related}} {{projects}} to develop the tank initiated in late 1916. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> V would be the application of as many advanced features as could be managed on <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> I hull design and <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> VI would be a complete break with <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> I hull. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> V would not be built as such, because of the delays with <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> IV {{and it would be a}} different Mark V that was built. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> VI project design had a completely new hull - taller and with rounded track paths. The single main gun was in the front of the hull. It did not progress past the stage of a wooden mock-up; the project was cancelled in December 1917 in order that a tank co-developed with <b>the</b> US (<b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> VIII) could go forward.|$|R
50|$|The last {{generation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> III class was <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> IIID Dor-Dalet (Hebrew: Fourth Generation), which included several components as prototypes {{to be introduced}} in <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> IV.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> 37 {{directors}} for {{the secondary}} batteries were fitted with <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 4 radar. With this {{system and the}} VT fused shells, the secondary batteries became formidable anti-air weapons, {{as well as being}} capable of using against surface targets. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> 4 was eventually replaced by <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 12/22.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> II version entered {{service in}} June 1940. It was {{modified}} with a selector {{to give a}} high rate of fire (750-850 rounds per minute) for close combat or focused targets or a low rate of fire (450-550 rounds per minute) for long-range combat or area targets. As the war progressed the design was modified to be more rapidly and economically produced. Three simplified models, <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> II*, Mark III and Mark III*, entered service in August 1943. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> II* was a transitional model designed to use the new simplified parts, but had backwards compatibility with <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> II. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> III and Mark III* versions did away with the rate selector and had simplified parts like <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> II*, but were not backwards compatible with <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> II. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> III had a fixed high rate of fire (750-850 rpm) and <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> III* had a fixed low rate of fire (450-550 rpm) ...|$|R
50|$|All Mark IVs were {{equipped}} with a vinyl roof. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> IV introduced <b>the</b> opera window to <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> series, a feature that would be featured in <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> through <b>the</b> discontinuation of <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> VI after 1983. For 1972, it was an almost universally specified option, becoming standard for 1973.|$|R
50|$|In 1951 <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> V was {{replaced}} by <b>the</b> Jaguar <b>Mark</b> VII. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> VII had <b>the</b> same 10 ft wheelbase as <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> V, but a longer and more streamlined-looking body, which continued in production with little outward change through <b>the</b> Jaguars <b>Mark</b> VIII and Mark IX until 1961.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> 37 {{directors}} for {{the secondary}} batteries were fitted with <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 4 radar. With this {{system and the}} VT fused shells, the secondary batteries became formidable anti-air weapons, {{as well as being}} capable of using against surface targets. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> 4 was eventually replaced by <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 12/22.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> 11 {{nuclear bomb}} was an American nuclear bomb {{developed}} from <b>the</b> earlier <b>Mark</b> 8 nuclear {{bomb in the}} mid-1950s. Like <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 8, <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 11 was an earth-penetrating weapon, {{also known as a}} nuclear bunker buster bomb.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> 20 {{nuclear bomb}} was a planned {{successor}} to <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 13 incorporating some improvements in its design. Research was halted {{at the same}} time as <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 13.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> 39 torpedo was {{the first}} homing torpedo in United States Navy service to use a {{trailing}} wire for mid-course guidance through the submarine's fire control system. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> 39 was a Mark 27 Mod 4 torpedo converted for development of wire guidance techniques, which were eventually incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 37 Mod 1 and <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 45. Due to this development, <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 39 was considered obsolete and the remaining inventory was scrapped.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{taking a}} <b>mark,</b> <b>the</b> umpire will {{blow the whistle}} to signify <b>the</b> <b>mark</b> and a player is {{entitled}} to an unimpeded kick of the ball, to advance his team towards their goalposts. The nearest opposition player stands on the spot where <b>the</b> player <b>marked</b> <b>the</b> ball, which {{is also known as}} <b>the</b> <b>mark,</b> and becomes <b>the</b> man on <b>the</b> <b>mark.</b> When taking <b>the</b> set kick, the player must either play on or kick the ball over <b>the</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gerber {{manufactured}} a scaled down {{version of}} <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> II known as <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> I. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> I had a 4.75 inch (12 cm) blade and was marketed as a boot knife.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> 13 {{nuclear bomb}} and its variant, the W-13 nuclear warhead, were {{experimental}} nuclear weapons {{developed by the}} United States from 1951 to 1954. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> 13 design was based on <b>the</b> earlier <b>Mark</b> 6 nuclear bomb design, which was in turn based on <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 4 nuclear bomb and <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 3 nuclear bomb used {{at the end of}} World War II.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> 13 was {{designed}} with unusually squat dimensions for its type: diameter was 22.5 in and length 13 ft. In <b>the</b> water, <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 13 could reach {{a speed of}} 33.5 kn for up to [...] <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> 13 ran 12.8 kn slower than <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 14 torpedo. 17,000 were produced during the war.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> 32 torpedo was {{the first}} active {{acoustic}} antisubmarine homing torpedo in United States Navy service. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> 32 was withdrawn from service use {{with the introduction of}} <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 43 torpedo.|$|R
50|$|Note: Most {{schools in}} Quebec have now {{switched}} to percentages. <b>The</b> <b>mark</b> <b>the</b> students receives is <b>the</b> <b>mark</b> that is shown. <b>The</b> 60% passing <b>mark</b> remains.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> V was, at first, {{intended}} to be a completely new design of tank, of which a wooden mock-up had been completed; however, when the new engine and transmission originally planned for <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> IV became available in December 1917, the first, more advanced Mark V design was abandoned to avoid disrupting production. The designation [...] "Mark V" [...] was switched to an improved version of <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> IV, equipped with the new systems. The original design of <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> IV was to have been a large improvement on <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> III, but had been scaled back due to technical delays. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> V thus turned out very similar to the original design of <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> IV - i.e. a greatly modified Mark III.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> X has a loyal {{following}} of enthusiasts and owners, as {{it continues}} where <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> II left off {{when it was}} replaced in 2004. Internationally, it isn't as well known as the Toyota Crown, which is available new at a different Toyota dealership. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> X is not pronounced [...] "Mark Ten" [...] but [...] "Mark Ex", though <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> II is [...] "Mark Two". <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> X {{is a continuation of}} <b>the</b> previous <b>Mark</b> II and its siblings, the sport-oriented Toyota Chaser, and the luxurious Toyota Cresta in one vehicle, repeating an approach previously attempted by the short lived Toyota Verossa that used straight-6 engines, whereas <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> X uses V6 engines.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, <b>the</b> nine-year-old <b>Mark</b> VII was {{replaced}} by <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> VIII. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> VIII again shared an all-new chassis with the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar; {{they were the only}} American-produced rear-wheel drive four-seat cars with independent rear suspension at the time. While carrying over the basic body profile from <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> VII, <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> VIII was radically streamlined, relegating the spare tire hump to vestigial status.|$|R
5000|$|Dinghys {{typically}} race {{around a}} windward-leeward race course. There is a start/finish [...] "line", set up perpendicular to <b>the</b> wind, <b>marked</b> {{by a committee}} boat at one end, and a buoy on the other.
