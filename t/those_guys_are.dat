500|$|Clark's adoptive father. Snyder {{explained}} his {{reason for his}} casting the on-screen couple is solely for the realism: [...] "I think the thing you realize {{when you look at}} Diane and Kevin, in our decision to cast them so far, you sort of {{get a sense of how}} tonally we're looking at the movie, and what you realize is that <b>those</b> <b>guys</b> <b>are</b> serious actors, and we're taking this movie very seriously in terms of the tone of having those guys. You're talking about having a situation where whatever the action is or whatever the drama of the movie is, our first priority is to make sure it's rendered in the most realistic way we can get at." ...|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the regular season, Virginia Tech's defense was ranked third nationally in scoring defense (12.6points allowed per game), fourth in total defense (269.5total yards allowed per game) and fifth in pass defense (149.8passing yards allowed per game). The Tech defense featured two highly regarded cornerbacks, Jimmy Williams and Eric Green, who finished the regular season with 50tackles and 31tackles, respectively. Williams also had fourinterceptions (the most on the team), including one returned for a touchdown, and was named first-team All-ACC. Green, meanwhile, had one interception. Auburn wide receiver Courtney Taylor praised the two players highly in an interview before the game, saying, [...] "Those cornerbacks are amazing to me every time I look at them. I think, 'God, <b>those</b> <b>guys</b> <b>are</b> very athletic.' We're going to have our hands full." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} David Robert Jones is {{a reference}} to English musician David Bowie, who was born with that name. [...] "In Which We Meet Mr. Jones" [...] was the first appearance of the character. When actor Jared Harris was first cast for the part, he was told Jones was [...] "possibly a major, important character", {{as indicated by the}} episode's title. Whether his character would make a reappearance later in the season depended on how well received Jones was by the show's audience, Harris' performance, and if the writers felt they had more to tell about the character. [...] Harris later described Jones in a May 2009 interview, [...] "I think you could sense that there was a great bit of ambiguity about the character which was useful. He's a bad guy that might be on the right side. He just might be fighting for the good guys. <b>Those</b> <b>guys</b> <b>are</b> always great parts because you leave the audience guessing about what side he's really on. He's one of those guys that if he's fighting for the right cause, he's a tremendous ally. But if he's fighting on the wrong cause, he's a formidable opponent. He's an anti-hero who is fighting for the just cause". Harris asserted in a February 2009 interview that he did not sign a recurring contract, meaning that the character was not meant to be permanent. He affirmed this by believing the character's personality rendered Jones incapable of joining the regular cast, [...] "You'd have to keep [...] chained like a dog. You couldn't let him loose. You certainly couldn't let him use his hands. You know what the f--k he'd do".|$|E

The competitive wrestlers, the highly successful amateur wrestlers have such tremendous mental toughness. If you can just get through the room, the wrestling room practices at like really high level universities, NCAA division one teams; <b>those</b> <b>guys</b> <b>are</b> savages. The stuff they go through, just the overtraining, just the mental toughness {{that you have to}} develop." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cork manager Conor Counihan {{expressed}} his feelings {{in the press}} room: [...] "Relief, {{at the end of}} the day. It's fantastic for the lads, each and every one of them. I spoke to them and we have 30 good guys here, but there are a lot of guys down the years who for one reason or another we had to move on from and <b>those</b> <b>guys</b> <b>are</b> part of this. And the last 20 years, we were landed with a fantastic group of players. They made it hard for themselves, but that makes it all the sweeter". Cork captain Graham Canty also {{expressed his}} feelings at a press conference: [...] "Ah. It feels all right now. It is humbling being captain of this bunch of players. I don't understand why I am in here, just because I am captain". Canty offered his sympathies to Down captain Benny Coulter for the loss he had suffered.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011 and 2012, {{band members}} {{continued}} with the sentiment {{that it was}} possible, depending mostly on everyone's schedule. In a November 2011 interview, Patrick said {{of the future of}} the band: <b>Those</b> <b>guys</b> <b>are</b> amazing, it's basically this simple: Robert has a studio in his basement where he can totally do his old-fashioned kind of classic sound. They can write and record at any moment in time, they can get Ray Luzier in to play drums and I can take it {{for a week or two}} and write vocals or sing it. So it's as easy as them kind of recording everything, which is actually probably tough because they're constantly working with Scott on Stone Temple Pilot stuff. So the band is always there, you know what I mean, we're alive, we talk, Dean and I are constantly in communication. Ray Luzier, every time I see him he's like [...] "Man that Army of Anyone record is still, people still come up to me and talk about that Army of Anyone record". And I think that I honestly could probably do a way better job just 'cause of what I've learned lately as a singer...I think the best Army of Anyone record is still to come, it's still totally doable and could be even better.|$|E

5000|$|Who Are <b>Those</b> <b>Guys?</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} New Riders album to feature Stephen Love on bass guitar.

A fourth original song, [...] "Home Grown", was written by drummer Spencer Dryden. The NRPS lineup for Who Are <b>Those</b> <b>Guys?</b> also included John [...] "Marmaduke" [...] Dawson, David Nelson, and Buddy Cage. Until Where I Come From was released in 2009, this was the only New Riders album that did not have any songs written by Dawson.|$|R
