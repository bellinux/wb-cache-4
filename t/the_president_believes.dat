5000|$|Nobel {{economist}} and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman called for DeMarco's firing in his blog on July 31, 2012. Krugman said that DeMarco had rejected a Treasury Department request to offer debt relief to homeowners, with Treasury covering 63 {{percent of the}} debt relief. Krugman said DeMarco's rejection {{was based on the}} net loss debt relief would cost taxpayers. Krugman questioned DeMarco's analysis, but also said that [...] "deciding whether debt relief is a good policy for {{the nation as a whole}} is not DeMarco's job. His job — as long as he keeps it, which I hope is a very short period of time — is to run his agency. If the Secretary of the Treasury, acting on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> <b>believes</b> that it is in the national interest to spend some taxpayer funds on debt relief, in a way that actually improves the FHFA's budget position, the agency's director has no business deciding on his own that he prefers not to act." [...] Three days later, in a New York Times op-ed, Krugman reiterated that DeMarco's efforts, along with other Republican policy makers in the legislative branch, have stalled the economy, and called again for Obama to fire DeMarco and replace him with a recess appointment. [...] Timothy Geithner is said to oppose DeMarco on this issue as well. DeMarco defended his position, claiming that allowing the debt relief would present a notable moral hazard, perhaps causing some homeowners to strategically allow themselves into debt to receive assistance.|$|E

40|$|In {{his second}} Inaugural Address, and elsewhere, President Bush has offered {{his vision for}} {{creating}} an “Ownership Society ” in America. By this he means encouraging more Americans to save in tax-benefited accounts for retirement, college, health care expenses, homeownership, and small business development. Americans who do this, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>believes,</b> {{will be able to}} exercise more personal responsibility and better control their and their kids ’ economic futures. Although the goals of promoting ownership should not displace social insurance and other programs aimed at struggling but aspiring Americans, the claim that families benefit from being able to build up assets is compelling. The underlying assumption is that ownership creates stakeholders and expanding opportunities for people to accumulate productive assets has broad social and economic benefits. In fact, the data show that many Americans have experienced the benefits of building assets and associate success and security with the accumulation and holding of financial resources. Yet the specific policy objectives required to fulfill this vision have received less attention. This paper presents a list of policy options to be considered to help achieve a more inclusive ownership society. We believe that an ownership society is a goal worth achieving, one this nation has embraced in the past through the Homestead Act and GI Bill. However, as shown in the table below, the bottom 60 % of Americans own less that 5 % of the nation’s wealth. Therefore, the starting point of our nation’s ownership policies must be the majority of Americans who are asset-poor. The Administration has begun to highlight several policy items designed to help more Americans save and become owners. The challenge appears clear: maximize the number of families capable of building assets and securing their future. Current public policy provides us many tools, but it is imperative that these tools be employed with three overriding principles in mind. First, policies should create opportunity by broadening access to benefits; second, all Americans should be able to participate; and third, benefits should be commensurate and not skewed towards those who already own a lot...|$|E
