5|$|Another {{trend in}} {{contemporary}} Danish architecture is <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> generation of successful young practices, inspired more by international trends {{than by the}} modernist tradition in Scandinavia.

5|$|The same period, when a {{battered}} Byzantium defended itself against enemies on all fronts, also saw <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new,</b> unexpected threat: the Rus' made their {{first appearance in}} Byzantine history with a raid against Paphlagonia in the 830s, followed by a major expedition in 860.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1980s, the {{prognosis}} or expected outcome of DPB was poor, especially in cases with superinfection (<b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> viral or bacterial infection, {{in addition to}} the currently occurring infection) by P.aeruginosa. DPB continued to have a very high mortality rate before generalized antibiotic treatment and oxygen therapy were beginning to be used routinely in the effort to manage symptoms. Around 1985, when long-term treatment with the antibiotic erythromycin became the standard for managing DPB, {{the prognosis}} significantly improved. In 1990, the association of DPB with HLA was initially asserted.|$|E

5|$|Canada's post-war {{economic}} growth, {{combined with}} the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Canadian identity, marked by {{the adoption of the}} Maple Leaf Flag in 1965, the implementation of official bilingualism (English and French) in 1969, and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971. Socially democratic programs were also instituted, such as Medicare, the Canada Pension Plan, and Canada Student Loans, though provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|The late 1930s saw <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> era of {{tolerance}} in the United States. National leaders hailed the Bill of Rights, particularly as it protected minorities, as {{the essence of}} democracy. The 1939 Supreme Court decision in Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization affirmed the right of communists to promote their cause. Even conservative elements, such as the American Bar Association began to campaign for civil liberties, which were long {{considered to be the}} domain of left-leaning organizations. By 1940, the ACLU had achieved many of the goals it set in the 1920s, and many of its policies were the law of the land.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{court in}} Bergen also started {{importing}} and translating the first true European literature that became {{available to a}} wider Norwegian audience. The literature which was popular then was heroic-romantic literature derived from the French and in turn English courts, notably chansons de geste around Charlemagne (the Matter of France) and tales of King Arthur (the Matter of Britain). The first work that was translated into Old Norse was reportedly the Arthurian romantic story Tristan and Iseult, which was finished in 1226 after orders from the young and newly-wed Haakon. Hákon's programme {{seems to have been}} the spark for <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Norse genre of chivalric sagas.|$|E

5|$|By the 1850s, Calcutta had two areas: White Town, {{which was}} {{primarily}} British and centred on Chowringhee and Dalhousie Square; and Black Town, mainly Indian and centred on North Calcutta. The city underwent rapid industrial growth {{starting in the}} early 1850s, especially in the textile and jute industries; this encouraged British companies to massively invest in infrastructure projects, which included telegraph connections and Howrah railway station. The coalescence of British and Indian culture resulted in <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> babu class of urbane Indians, whose members were often bureaucrats, professionals, newspaper readers, and Anglophiles; they usually belonged to upper-caste Hindu communities. In the 19th century, the Bengal Renaissance brought about an increased sociocultural sophistication among city denizens. In 1883, Calcutta was host to the first national conference of the Indian National Association, the first avowed nationalist organisation in India.|$|E
5|$|From the 1980s Scottish {{literature}} enjoyed {{another major}} revival, particularly {{associated with a}} group of Glasgow writers focused around meetings in the house of critic, poet and teacher Philip Hobsbaum. Also important in the movement was Peter Kravitz, editor of Polygon Books. Members of the group that would come to prominence as writers included James Kelman, Alasdair Gray, Liz Lochhead, Tom Leonard and Aonghas MacNeacail. In the 1990s major, prize-winning, Scottish novels that emerged from this movement included Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting (1993), Warner's Morvern Callar (1995), Gray's Poor Things (1992) and Kelman's How Late It Was, How Late (1994). These works were linked by a sometimes overtly political reaction to Thatcherism that explored marginal areas of experience and used vivid vernacular language (including expletives and Scots dialect). Scottish crime fiction has been a major area of growth with the success of novelists including Val McDermid, Frederic Lindsay, Christopher Brookmyre, Quintin Jardine, Denise Mina and particularly the success of Edinburgh's Ian Rankin and his Inspector Rebus novels. This period also saw <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> generation of Scottish poets that became leading figures on the UK stage, including Don Paterson, Robert Crawford, Kathleen Jamie and Carol Ann Duffy. Glasgow-born Carol Ann Duffy was named as Poet Laureate in May 2009, the first woman, the first Scot and the first openly gay poet to take the post.|$|E
5|$|The 14th {{century in}} England saw the Great Famine and the Black Death, catastrophic events that killed around half of England's population, {{throwing}} the economy into chaos and undermining the old political order. Social unrest followed, {{resulting in the}} Peasants' Revolt of 1381, while {{the changes in the}} economy resulted in <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> class of gentry, and the nobility began to exercise power through a system termed bastard feudalism. Nearly 1,500 villages were deserted by their inhabitants and many men and women sought new opportunities in the towns and cities. New technologies were introduced, and England produced some of the great medieval philosophers and natural scientists. English kings in the 14th and 15th centuries laid claim to the French throne, resulting in the Hundred Years' War. At times England enjoyed huge military success, with the economy buoyed by profits from the international wool and cloth trade, but by 1450 the country was in crisis, facing military failure in France and an ongoing recession. More social unrest broke out, followed by the Wars of the Roses, fought between rival factions of the English nobility. Henry VII's victory in 1485 conventionally marks the end of the Middle Ages in England and the start of the Early Modern period.|$|E

25|$|The {{best example}} of <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> style is in the {{contemporary}} coinage. The images of the Parthian kings are often highly stylized in the 1st century. Angular shapes replaced the round, flowing forms of the Greek style, at least more prevalently, on the profile on the coins. From about 50 BC on, Parthia saw frequent clashes with the Greco-oriented Rome. The new style is therefore perhaps a deliberate departure from the Hellenistic traditions {{and a return to}} their own traditions and values.|$|E
25|$|The early 1970s saw <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> crop of West Indian cricketers, ones {{eager to}} shake the tag of Calypso, and who could {{dominate}} world cricket. However, {{it is said that}} when you have 10 young men from various islands in the Caribbean, you don't have a team; you have a gang. What was needed was a guiding hand, who could steer this young team in the right direction, and unite them for a common cause on the cricket field. That man was Clive Lloyd. Appointed as Captain in 1974, Lloyd's first major challenge came in the 1975-76 West Indies Tour of Australia.|$|E
25|$|The 1925 Giro d'Italia saw <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> star, Alfredo Binda. Despite winning six {{legs of the}} event, Costante Girardengo did not win the race.

Binda won the Giro in his first attempt. Reigning champion Binda started off the following year's race with a crash in the first stage, which caused him to lose lots of time. Due to the crash, Binda worked as a domestique for his teammate Giovanni Brunero. With Binda's aid, Brunero won the whole event, while Binda won six stages.|$|E
