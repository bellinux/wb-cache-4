40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{prevalence}} of <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> <b>autoantibody</b> in euthyroid pregnant women and to evaluate the association between <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> <b>autoantibody</b> and pregnancy outcomes. Materials and Methods: One thousand thirty consecutive pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic {{over a period of}} 1 year and were carrying a healthy singleton uncomplicated intrauterine pregnancy and consuming iodized salt were recruited for the study. Outcomes of the pregnancy was compared between TPO antibody positive euthyroid women (group 1) and TPO antibody negative euthyroid women (group 2). Results: Out of 1030 women, 164 (18. 9 %) were detected TPO antibody positive with euthyroid status. The mean FT 4 and TSH level were significantly different in those who were TPO Ab positive as compared TPO Ab negative euthyroid pregnant women. No correlation was observed between the maternal age, gestational age and gravidity with anti TPO antibody levels. Eighteen (12 %) women in Group 1 and 5 (3. 3 %) women in Group 2 had miscarriages and the difference was found to be statistically significant (P value of 0. 004). Twenty-one (14 %) women in Group 1 and 5 (3. 3 %) women in Group 2 had preterm deliveries, which was also found to be statistically significantly (p value of 0. 001). Other pregnancy related complications like Intrauterine death, IUGR, preeclampsia and PIH though are present in comparatively higher number in TPO Ab positive euthyroid pregnant women as compared to TPO Ab negative euthyroid pregnant women but this difference was not found to be statistically significant. Conclusions: To conclude with the present study shows that a good number of pregnant women with euthyroid status have TPO Ab positivity and this is associated with some adverse pregnancy outcomes like miscarriage and preterm birth of the baby...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} hashitoxicosis {{outcome in}} 14 children with persistent absence of thyrotropin receptor autoantibodies who were followed for 1. 3 - 8. 8 years (mean 3. 5 ± 2. 5). Due {{to a more}} severe presentation, 4 patients required methimazole (subgroup A 1), whilst in the remaining 10 cas es (subgroup A 2) no treatment was given. RESULTS: A definitive resolution of hyperthyroidism was recorded 8. 3 ± 6. 3 months after diagnosis, {{even though there was}} a wide variability between subjects (3 - 23 months). In subgroup A 2, hyperthyroidism resolution occurred spontaneously and earlier with respect to subgroup A 1 (4. 8 ± 2. 0 months after diagnosis vs. 17. 0 ± 4. 5, p = 0. 00001). After hyperthyroidism resolution, no relapses were recorded in any patients. Hyperthyroidism duration positively correlated with <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> <b>autoantibody</b> (TPOAb) levels at presentation (r = 0. 729, p = 0. 002). CONCLUSIONS: In all the 14 hashitoxicosis children with persistently absent thyrotropin receptor autoantibodies, the hyperthyroid phase was widely variable and always followed by definitive resolution with no relapses and persistent euthyroidism or hypothyroidism. In the few patients with a more severe presentation, methimazole treatment was required, and definitive hyperthyroidism resolution was delayed. In this subgroup, TPOAb levels at diagnosis were higher than in the subgroup with less severe presentation and earlier hyperthyroidism resolution, suggesting a relationship between TPOAb levels and severity of the disease...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Several studies {{indicate}} that in utero exposure to maternal autoimmune diseases and transplacental passage of autoantibodies affect the risk of autoimmunity in the offspring, e. g., maternally derived GAD 65 autoantibody correlates with decreased risk of type 1 diabetes, whereas <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> <b>autoantibody</b> (TPOAb) positivity at birth is associated with increased incidence of autoimmune thyroid disease later in life. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify immunological changes in children born to mothers with thyroid autoimmunity that may be related to in utero exposure to autoantibodies. DESIGN AND METHOD: Open label prospective analysis of cord blood lymphocytes and serum cytokines by Flow Cytometry in children born to mothers with autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) (n= 31) and to healthy mothers (n= 76) and titers of thyroid autoantibodies were determined in cord blood and in maternal peripheral blood at delivery. RESULTS: We found an increase (almost 30 %) in the frequency of cord blood natural killer (NK) cells (p= 0. 0016) and a minor increase in the subset of T cells expressing NK markers (p= 0. 028), in children born to AIT mothers. There were no detectable differences in the phenotype or frequency of cord blood memory/activated T cells, including CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) T cells, between the 2 groups. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-Î±, IL- 10, IL- 12 p 70, IFN-Î³ and IL- 1 Î² were significantly decreased in offspring of AIT mothers as compared to healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal thyroid autoimmunity and transplacental passage of autoantibodies against thyroid antigens may affect the generation or expansion of cells with NK activity and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of thyroglobulin autoantibodies {{and that of}} <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> were studied in serum samples from 52 children with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, sampled at diagnosis and {{before the start of}} insulin treatment, with 386 non-diabetic schoolchildren (11 to 13 years of age) serving as control subjects. Using exactly the same sensitive solid-phase immunosorbent radioassay for both thyroid autoantibodies, with comparable sensitivity, we found the prevalences of both autoantibodies to be higher in the insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus group than in the control group, the difference being most pronounced for <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> <b>autoantibodies.</b> Thyroglobulin autoantibodies were positive in 33 % of the diabetics versus 14 % in the control group (p = 0. 002), and <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> were positive in 38 % versus 6 % (p = 0. 0001).

40|$|OBJECTIVE—We {{sought to}} define the {{prevalence}} of nonislet, organ-specific autoantibodies at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and to determine the prevalence of comorbid autoimmune diseases. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Children (n = 491) diagnosedwithtype 1 diabetes at the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes were screened for autoimmune <b>thyroid</b> disease (<b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> [TPOAb]), celiac disease (tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies [TTGAb]), and Addison disease (21 -hydroxylase autoantibodies [21 OHAb]). RESULTS—Of the 491 children, 161 {{had at least one}} nonislet autoantibody, and of these, 122 (24. 8 %) were positive for TPOAb, and 15 of the 122 (12. 3 %) had autoimmune thyroid disease. There were 57 (11. 6 %) who were positive for TTGAb, of whom 14 (24. 6 %) had celiac disease. Five (1. 0 %) were positive for 21 OHAb, of whom one had Addison disease. CONCLUSIONS—Many autoantibody-positive subjects present with additional autoimmune disorders. Detection of these autoantibodies at type 1 diabetes onset may prevent complications associated with delayed diagnosis of these disorders. Type 1 diabetes occurs in one in 300 individuals (1) and is associated with other autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune thyroid disease (AIT) in 15 – 30 %, celiac disease (CD) in 4 – 9 %, and Addison disease (AD) in 0. 5 % (2); detection of which is crucial to prevent morbidity related to unrecognized disease. Assays for <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> (TPOAb) in AIT, tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (TTGAb) in CD, and 21 hydroxylase autoantibodies (21 OHAb) in AD, may be used to screen for asymptomatic disease to identify risk of progression to overt disease. Previous studies have examined multiple autoantibodies in cohorts of patients with type 1 diabetes (3).

40|$|Objectives To assess uptake of {{community-based}} capillary {{thyroid stimulating hormone}} (TSH) screening in Scotland and determine the optimal frequency of screening, the justifi cation for preschool screening and strategies for treatment. Methods Subjects with Down’s syndrome aged 1 – 19 years underwent capillary TSH measurement. Clinical and biochemical data were collected using proformas. Results 5742 capillary TSH tests were performed on 1329 children in 1997 – 2009, increasing from 183 children from two health boards tested in 1997 to 630 from 13 health boards tested in 2009. Of 132 children referred by the screening laboratory with elevated capillary TSH, 98 (M:F ratio 1 : 1. 2, median (range) age 8. 9 (0. 9 – 17. 9) years) had adequate documentation and 76 had thyroid dysfunction (defi ned as venous TSH> 6 mU/l), giving a prevalence of not less than 5. 7 %. Fifty-six (57 %) had tested negative during the previous year, 8 (8 %) tested positive on their fi rst screening test and 23 / 67 (34 %) were <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> <b>autoantibody</b> negative on initial venous blood. Two of the 13 (13 %) preschool children were severely hypothyroid (venous TSH 71 and 283 mU/l). Of patients with venous TSH 6 – 10. 9 (n= 27), 11. 0 – 20. 9 (n= 25) and ≥ 21. 0 mU/l (n= 24) following referral, initial/subsequent treatment with thyroxine was given in 3 / 8, 15 / 5 and 21 / 1, respectively. Conclusion Capillary TSH screening in Down’s syndrome is eminently feasible and should be performed annually from 1 year of age. Nearly all subjects with initial venous TSH ≥ 11. 0 mU/l will require thyroxine treatment but most with TSH 6 – 10 mU/l only require surveillance initially...|$|E
40|$|Objective: In Graves ’ disease (GD), {{stimulating}} anti-TSH receptor antibodies {{are responsible}} for hyperthyroidism. T-helper 2 (Th 2) cells {{were expected to be}} involved in the underlying immune mech-anism, although this is still controversial. The aim of this study was to examine the expression of CXCR 6, a chemokine receptor that marks functionally specialized T-cells within the Th 1 and T-cyto-toxic 1 (Tc 1) cell pool, to gain new insights into the running immune processes. Methods: CXCR 6 expression was examined on peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and thyroid-derived lymphocytes (TLs) of GD patients in flow cytometry. CXCR 6 cDNA was quantified in thyroid tissues affected by GD (n 16), Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT; n 2) and thyroid autonomy (TA; n 11) using real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. Results: The percentages of peripheral CXCR 6 þ PBLs did not differ between GD and normal subjects. CXCR 6 was expressed by small subsets of circulating T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells. CXCR 6 þ cells were enriched in thyroid-derived T-cells compared with peripheral CD 4 þ and CD 8 þ T-cells in GD. The increase was evident within the Th 1 (CD 4 þ interferon-gþ (IFN-gþ)) and Tc 1 (CD 8 þIFN-gþ) subpopulation and CD 8 þ granzyme Aþ T-cells (cytotoxic effector type). Thyroid-derived fibro-blasts and thyrocytes were CXCR 62. There was no significant difference between the CXCR 6 mRNA levels in GD compared with HT and normal TA tissues. The lowest CXCR 6 mRNA levels were obtained from thyroid nodules from TA patients and GD patients with low <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> <b>autoantibody</b> levels. Conclusions: CXCR 6 was overexpressed in Th 1 and Tc 1 TLs compared with PBLs in GD. CXCR 6 could be a marker for lymphocytes that have migrated into the thyroid and assist in the thyroid, indepen-dently of the bias of the underlying disease...|$|E
40|$|Blood {{samples from}} 141 {{children}} and adolescents were used to evaluate differences between commercial kits and radioimmunoassay (RIA) methods for detecting thyroid autoantibodies.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{association}} between thyroid disorders and adverse pregnancy outcomes, the underlying pathophysiology and treatment possibilities. The association between thyroid disorders and adverse pregnancy outcomes is investigated in a systematic review and two retrospective cohort studies. Women with subclinical hypothyroidism and/or thyroid autoimmunity in pregnancy have an increased risk for unexplained subfertility, (recurrent) miscarriage, preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, breech presentation, perinatal mortality and maternal post-partum thyroiditis. Observational data show that thyroid function disorders and <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> antibodies are associated with disturbed folliculogenesis, spermatogenesis, lower fertilisation rates and lower embryo quality. Available evidence shows that thyroid hormone transporters and receptors are expressed in the ovary, the early embryo, endometrium, uterus and placenta suggesting that thyroid hormone has a direct effect on reproduction and pregnancy. However, the exact underlying pathophysiology of these associations remains unclear. There are no data on the mechanisms underlying {{the association between}} <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> and reproduction. Treatment possibilities of thyroid disorders in pregnancy have been studied in a systematic review and a retrospective cohort study. Treatment of hyperthyroidism {{reduces the risk of}} preterm delivery, pre-eclampsia and low birth weight. Levothyroxine is effective in reducing the risk of miscarriage and preterm delivery. Current evidence is insufficient to advise treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism or thyroid autoimmunity. To further investigate the effect of levothyroxine treatment in pregnant women with thyroid autoimmunity, a multicentre, international, randomized controlled study has been started and the study protocol is described in this thesis...|$|R

Here, we determine the association between {{the presence of a}} panel of autoantibodies at baseline and change in depression symptom score over 5 -year follow-up in a cohort of healthy elderly Australians. Methods: Serum samples from 2049 randomly selected subjects enrolled in the Hunter Community Study (HCS) aged 55 - 85 years were assayed for a range of autoimmune markers (anti-nuclear autoantibodies, extractable nuclear antigen autoantibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic <b>autoantibodies,</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> <b>autoantibodies,</b> tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies, anti-cardiolipin autoantibodies, rheumatoid factor and cyclic citrullinated peptide autoantibodies) at baseline. Depression symptom score was assessed using the Centre for Epidemiological Study (CES-D) scale at baseline and 5 years later. Results: Autoantibody prevalence varied amongst our sample with ANA being the most prevalent; positive in 16 % and borderline in 36 % of study population. No evidence for a relationship was found between change in CES-D score over time and any autoimmune marker. Statins and high cholesterol were significantly associated with change in CES-D score over time in univariate analysis; however, these were probably confounded since they failed to remain significant following multivariable analysis. Conclusions: Autoantibodies were not associated with change in CES-D score over time.

40|$|Thyroid hormone is {{a master}} {{regulator}} of growth and development in all vertebrates. Thus, disruption of its synthesis and activity can lead to profound consequences. Past decade studies on thyroid function tests have established an efficient guideline for monitoring thyroid diseases, yet {{a significant proportion of}} healthcare providers do not defer to it in their practice. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess provider practices in the diagnosis and treatment of primary hypothyroidism due to autoimmunity at Boston Children's Hospital (CHB) for a primarily pediatric patient population.

40|$|The {{problem of}} the human antithyroid <b>peroxidase</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> epitopes {{heterogeneity}} diagnosed in case of Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis has been researched using monoclonal antibodies to <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase.</b> It was shown, that in the competition for the binding sites of <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> and <b>autoantibodies</b> taken from patients with Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis sera participate 8 mAb to epitopes 1, 70, 82, 88, 2, 3, 77 and 79. The maxima of the binding inhibition has been marked for the conformation epitope mAb 3 : in case of Graves' disease it amounts to 60. 3 ± 12. 7 %, in case of Hashimoto's thyroiditis – 61. 8 ± 32. 2 %. Moreover {{the level of the}} binding inhibition did not depend on the concentration of Ab to <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> in the sera of patient with Graves' as opposed to the serum of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Autoantibodies in the serum of the patientswith Hashimoto's thyroiditis inhibited the binding of mAb to epitope 77 much more effectively, than in the serum of the patients with: 36. 3 ± 17. 2 and 54. 3 ± 9. 6 % (p ≤ 0. 05). The obtained results represented the specific reaction of the autoantibodies to the certain <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> molecular patterns which corresponds to the literature data. It is possible to assume that the further research of the competitive interactions with other autoantibodies to monoclonal antibodies, not included in this trial, and widening of the different thyroid diseased patients' serum palette can expose new immunodominant <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> molecular patterns, forming antibodies for different diseases, and enable the development of diagnostics and control of the thyroid functions and applied therapy...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether the environmental events causing type 1 diabetes influence thyroid autoimmunity. Methods Monozygotic and dizygotic twins discordant for type 1 diabetes from the UK and USA were tested for <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> (TPOA) by radioimmunoassay. Using quantitative genetic model fitting of a liability-threshold model we estimated the contribution of genetic (heritability) and environmental factors to TPOA. Results TPOA positivity was higher in females than in males in both cohorts and was associated with later age at diagnosis in the UK and combined cohorts (p 0. 2 in all groups). The best-fitting models showed heritability (95 % CI) estimates for TPOA of 63 % (37 %, 80 %) for the UK and 80 % (51 %, 92 %) for US twins, while the best-fitting meta-analysis model of the two twin cohorts combined included additive genetic and unique environmental factors with a heritability estimate of 69 % (50 %, 82 %). Conclusions/interpretation Risk of thyroid autoimmunity, defined by TPOA, in the context of autoimmune diabetes is, substantially, genetically determined in discordant twin pairs. Environmental factors leading to type 1 diabetes were not the same as those involved with thyroid autoimmunity. It follows that it is as important to investigate for thyroid autoimmunity in relatives of type 1 diabetes patients as it is in the patients themselves...|$|R

40|$|Background: Despite great progress, {{the genetic}} basis of Graves’ disease (GD) remains poorly understood. Recently, a {{population}} based genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified five novel loci (ATXN 2 / SH 2 B 3, MAGI 3, BACH 2, TPO and KALRN) as {{significantly associated with}} the presence of <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> (TPOAbs), whereas several other loci showed suggestive association. Methods: In this study, we investigated 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with TPOAbs for the association with susceptibility to and phenotype of GD in a cohort of 647 GD patients and 769 controls from a Polish Caucasian population. Results: SNPs within/near HCP 5 (rs 3094228, P = 1. 6 x 10 - 12, OR= 1. 88), MAGI 3 (rs 1230666, P= 1. 9 x 10 - 5, OR= 1. 51) and ATXN 2 /SH 2 B 3 (rs 653178, P = 0. 0015, OR= 1. 28) loci were significantly associated with susceptibility to GD. Allele frequencies differed significantly in subgroups of GD patients stratified by age of GD onset for HCP 5 (P = 0. 0014, OR= 1. 50) and showed a suggestive difference for MAGI 3 (P = 0. 0035, OR= 1. 50) SNPs. Although rs 11675434 located near TPO showed no association with GD susceptibility, it was significantly associated {{with the presence of}} clinically evident Graves’ ophthalmopathy (GO, P = 5. 2 x 10 - 5, OR= 1. 64) and this effect was independent from smoking status, age of GD onset and gender. Conclusions This is the first study showing an association of the ATXN 2 /SH 2 B 3 locus with susceptibility to GD. Furthermore, we observed a novel significant association within the HLA region at a SNP located near HCP 5 and confirmed the association of the MAGI 3 locus with GD susceptibility. HCP 5 and MAGI 3 SNPs were further correlated with age of GD onset. Finally, we identified TPO as a new susceptibility locus for GO. </br...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which T cells accumulate in the thyroid and support the autoimmune process in patients with Graves’ disease (GD) are poorly understood. Chemokines and their receptors {{may be involved in}} this process. We have analysed the expression of CXCR 3 and CCR 5 as Th 1 -specific chemokine receptors, CCR 3 as a marker for Th 2 cells, CXCR 4 (expressed on unprimed, naive T cells) and CCR 2 (known to be involved in autoimmunity) on peripheral blood (PBL) and thyroid-derived lymphocytes (TL) using flow cytometry. Chemokine receptor expression on PBL of GD patients (n = 16) did not differ from that of normal controls (n = 10). In GD, CXCR 3 + (67 · 3 ± 4 · 0 %versus 45 · 7 ± 2 · 1 %) and CCR 5 + T cells (42 · 5 ± 3 · 4 %versus 18 · 8 ± 2 · 1 %) showed a significant enrichment in the TL compared to PBL. The positive cells were contributed mainly by the CD 4 +CD 45 R 0 + subset. TL are mostly primed CD 45 R 0 + T cells, but surprisingly, they had significantly higher levels of CXCR 4 + cells among TL (96 · 2 ± 1 · 0 %) compared to PBL (66 · 8 ± 4 · 2 %). However, CXCR 4 has been induced during in vitro isolation of TL. There was no correlation between chemokine receptors and the level of TSH-receptor and <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> <b>autoantibodies.</b> CCR 3 + and CCR 2 + cells remained unchanged in TL compared to PBL.

The aim {{of the study was}} to test the hypothesis that serum factors related to these growth and connective tissue abnormalities and the early accumulation of immune cells, ie, tissue growth/remodeling factors, adhesion molecules, chemokines, and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, are related to <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> (TPO-Abs) seroconversion in subjects at risk to develop autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). A controlled study on 64 TPO-Ab-negative euthyroid female relatives with at least 1 first- or second-degree relative with documented autoimmune hyper- or hypothyroidism, 32 of whom did and 32 who did not seroconvert to TPO-Ab positivity in 5 -year follow-up. The relatives were compared with 32 healthy controls. In all subjects we measured serum levels of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL) - 2, CCL 3, CCL 4, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule- 1, thrombospondin- 1, vascular endothelial growth factor-A, angiopoietin 1 receptor- 2, metalloproteinase- 13, platelet-derived growth factor-BB, fibronectin, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, TNF-α, IL- 10, and growth differentiation factor- 15 by multiplex (cytometric bead array) or a single commercial ELISA. Both seroconverting and nonseroconverting family members showed an up-regulation of fibronectin and a down-regulation of platelet-derived growth factor-BB and the adhesion and migration factors CCL 2, CCL 4, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1, angiopoietin 1 receptor- 2, and metalloproteinase- 13. The seroconverters differed from the nonseroconverters by an up-regulation of the proinflammatory compounds Il- 1 β, IL- 6, and CCL 3. This study shows that euthyroid females within AITD families show a characteristic pattern of abnormalities in serum levels of tissue remodeling factors, growth factors, chemokines, (vascular) adhesion molecules, and cytokines prior to the occurrence of TPO-Abs in serum. The results provide proof of principle that preseroconversion stages and seroconversion to AITD might be predicted using serum analytes related to growth/connective tissue abnormalities and migration/accumulation abnormalities of macrophages and dendritic cell...|$|R
40|$|Thyroid hormone {{disorders}} and <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> (TPO-Ab) in women {{are associated with}} subfertility and early pregnancy loss. Here, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview {{of the literature on}} the pathophysiology of these associations. A review of the literature in the English language was carried out. Relevant studies were identified by searching Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register from 1975 until March 2014. From a total of 6108 primary selected articles from the literature search, 105 articles were selected for critical appraisal. Observational data indicate that altered thyroid hormone levels are associated with disturbed folliculogenesis, spermatogenesis, lower fertilization rates and lower embryo quality. Triiodothyronine (T 3) in combination with FSH enhances granulosa cell proliferation and inhibits granulosa cell apoptosis by the PI 3 K/Akt pathway. T 3 is considered a biological amplifier of the stimulatory action of gonadotrophins on granulosa cell function. T 3 increases the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), MMP- 2, MMP- 3, fetal fibronectin and integrin α 5 β 1 T 3 in early placental extravillous trophoblasts. Thyroid hormone transporters and receptors are expressed in the ovary, early embryo, endometrium, uterus and placenta. No other data explaining the associations could be retrieved from the literature. The presence of TPO-Ab is negatively associated with spermatogenesis, fertilization and embryo quality, but no data are available on the potential pathophysiological mechanisms. Thyroid hormone {{disorders and}} TPO-Ab are associated with disturbed folliculogenesis, spermatogenesis, fertilization and embryogenesis. The pathophysiology of these associations remains largely unknown, as evidence is limited and includes studies using small sample sizes, and often restricted to animal models. There are no studies on the pathophysiology underlying the association between TPO-Ab and reproduction. The available evidence, although limited, supports a role of thyroid hormone in fertility and early pregnancy. This justifies clinical intervention studies on the effects of thyroid hormone supplementation in women with subclinical hypothyroidism and in women prone to develop hypothyroidism due to the presence of TPO-Ab. In addition, {{more research is needed to}} identify the underlying mechanisms. This would be of particular interest in women undergoing IVF to pinpoint the effects of thyroid hormone on different parameters of reproductio...|$|R

To better characterize the epitopes of BPAgl, we generated immortalized B cell lines secreting human mAbs (HumAbs) to BPAgl from two BP patients whose sera reacted with native BPAgl but not with a recombinant BP 55 carboxyl-terminal peptide. Ab-producing B cell lines were established by EBV infection of CD 40 -activated PBMCs. Three independent clonal lines were obtained that secreted IgG Hum-Abs, including one IgG 1 K (BP 3) and two distinct l g G 4 ~ (BPI and BP 2). These three HumAbs immunoprecipitated BPAgl. Blocking immunofluorescence experiments and phylogenetic studies showed that these Abs recognize different epitopes of BPAgl.

40|$|An {{association}} between breast cancer (BC) and thyroid autoimmunity (TA) has been frequently observed and several small-scale studies correlated {{the presence of}} <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> (TPO) <b>autoantibodies</b> (TPOAb) with an improved BC outcome. The presence of an immune response to shared thyroid/breast antigens has been hypothesized: both tissues express the sodium iodide symporter (NIS) and have a peroxidase activity: TPO in thyroid and lactoperoxidase (LPO) in breast. I have identified 3 possibilities: i) BC patients with TPOAb may also have autoantibodies to NIS (NISAb) ii) BC may express TPO iii) TPOAb may cross-react with LPO in BC. This thesis aimed to identify the TA/BC shared antigen(s) and also investigated the prognostic role of TPOAb in a large cohort of BC patients. The presence of NISAb was investigated by flow cytometry using CHO cells stably transfected with human NIS. No positive response was obtained in 42 patients with BC and/or TA, therefore NIS {{is unlikely to be}} an antigen. TPO transcripts (RT-PCR, QPCR, LongRange PCR) and protein (western blot, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence) were detected in BC tissues but at levels 104 times less than in thyroid tissue. TPO was also expressed in adipose tissue and different cancers. Some potentially BC specific TPO isoforms were identified. The observational large-scale study conducted on 1974 women affected with BC did not reveal any evidence for a significant impact of TPOAb and/or thyroid function on BC prognosis. In conclusion, BC and thyroid tissues share similar properties and could be common targets of TA, with TPO being the most likely common antigen; further studies are needed to clarify the role of tissue-specific TPO isoforms. The roles of TPOAb and thyroid function on BC prognosis have to be reconsidered, maybe focusing on different TA aspects (e. g. goitre, different autoantibodies) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Hashimoto’s {{thyroiditis}} (HT) is {{the most}} prevalent autoimmune thyroid disorder. Intrathyroidal lymphocytic infiltration {{is followed by a}} gradual destruction of the thyroid gland which may lead to subclinical or overt hypothyroidism. Biochemical markers of the disease are <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> and/or thyroglobulin <b>autoantibodies</b> in the serum which are present with a higher prevalence in females than in males and increase with age. Although exact mechanisms of aetiology and pathogenesis of the disorder are not completely understood, a strong genetic susceptibility to the disease has been confirmed predominantly by family and twin studies. Several genes were shown {{to be associated with the}} disease occurrence, progression, and severity. Genes for human leukocyte antigen, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen- 4, protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor-type 22, thyroglobulin, vitamin D receptor, and cytokines are considered to be of utmost importance. Amongst endogenous factors for the disease development, the attention is focused predominantly on female sex, pregnancy with postpartum period and fetal microchimerism. Environmental factors influencing HT development are iodine intake, drugs, infections and different chemicals. Disturbed self-tolerance accompanied by the increased antigen presentation is a prerequisite for the HT occurrence, whereas proper interaction of thyroid cells, antigen presenting cells, and T cells are necessary for the initiation of thyroid autoimmunity. Secreted cytokines lead predominantly to T-helper type 1 (Th 1) response as well as to Th 17 response which has only recently been implicated. Final outcome of HT is thyroid destruction which is mostly a consequence of the apoptotic processes combined with T-cell mediated cytotoxicity...|$|R

METHODS: Two commercially available radioimmunoassays for antibodies to <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase,</b> a commercially available agglutination test of particles coated with thyroid microsomal antigens, and a radioimmunoassay for thyrotropin receptor antibodies were used. Patients and controls were studied. RESULTS: One of the radioimmunoassays detected <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> antibodies not only in all children with autoimmune thyroid disorders and children and young adults with type 1 diabetes and thyroid microsomal antibodies, but also in 20 % of healthy control children without microsomal antibodies. With this <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> assay and with microsomal agglutination, 94 % of the children with autoimmune thyroiditis, 71 % of those with Graves' disease, and over 90 % of those with type 1 diabetes and thyroid dysfunction tested positive. In the other radioimmunoassay for <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> antibodies <b>thyroid</b> <b>peroxidase</b> antibody titres in half or more of the children with microsomal antibodies failed to reach the level of positivity given by the producers.
