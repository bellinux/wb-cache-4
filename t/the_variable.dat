5|$|Each {{heavy chain}} has two regions, the {{constant}} region and <b>the</b> <b>variable</b> region. The constant region is identical in all antibodies {{of the same}} isotype, but differs in antibodies of different isotypes. Heavy chains γ, α and δ have a constant region composed of three tandem (in a line) Ig domains, and a hinge region for added flexibility; heavy chains μ and ε have a constant region composed of four immunoglobulin domains. <b>The</b> <b>variable</b> region of the heavy chain differs in antibodies produced by different B cells, but {{is the same for}} all antibodies produced by a single B cell or B cell clone. <b>The</b> <b>variable</b> region of each heavy chain is approximately 110 amino acids long and is composed of a single Ig domain.|$|E

5|$|The {{chromosomal}} region that encodes an antibody {{is large and}} contains several distinct gene loci for each domain of the antibody—the chromosome region containing heavy chain genes (IGH@) is found on chromosome 14, and the loci containing lambda and kappa light chain genes (IGL@ and IGK@) are found on chromosomes 22 and 2 in humans. One of these domains is called <b>the</b> <b>variable</b> domain, which is present in each heavy and light chain of every antibody, but can differ in different antibodies generated from distinct B cells. Differences, between <b>the</b> <b>variable</b> domains, are located on three loops known as hypervariable regions (HV-1, HV-2 and HV-3) or complementarity determining regions (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3). CDRs are supported within <b>the</b> <b>variable</b> domains by conserved framework regions. The heavy chain locus contains about 65 different variable domain genes that all differ in their CDRs. Combining these genes {{with an array of}} genes for other domains of the antibody generates a large cavalry of antibodies {{with a high degree of}} variability. This combination is called V(D)J recombination discussed below.|$|E
