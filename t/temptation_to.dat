5|$|Abum tells another story, {{which he}} {{believes}} shows that mankind no longer needs demonic <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> be damned. Abum followed an everyman figure called Brock, watching his grindingly repetitive life. Brock visited {{a strip club}} often but without joy, which led Abum to believe he no longer took pleasure from sinning. One day, Abum added an additional irritation to Brock's life, posing as a traffic warden and giving him a ticket. This was enough to drive Brock to suicide. However, during this time, Abum also encountered Black, who again saw his demonic nature.|$|E
5|$|Chase was {{promoted}} to Brigadier General in March 1943 on assuming command of the 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division. He was chosen to lead {{the assault on the}} Admiralty Islands in February 1944. He resisted the <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> swiftly overrun the island, and thereby overextend his forces, and formed a defensive perimeter that made good use of the terrain. From this position, he was able to defeat a series of counterattacks by the numerically superior Japanese garrison.|$|E

5|$|And {{where in}} modern {{dramatic}} literature can such pearls be matched—Julie incoherently confessing to her dead lover the love {{she had always}} been ashamed to tell; Liliom crying out to the distant carousel the glad news that he is to be a father; the two thieves gambling for the spoils of their prospective robbery; Marie and Wolf posing for their portrait while the broken-hearted Julie stands looking after the vanishing Liliom, the thieves' song ringing in her ears; the two policemen grousing about pay and pensions while Liliom lies bleeding to death; Liliom furtively proffering his daughter the star he has stolen for her in heaven.... The <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> count the whole scintillating string is difficult to resist.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Hobbits’ fears, Faramir {{was wise}} {{enough to realize that}} such a weapon was not to be used and if desired, should be resisted. With this knowledge, he also {{realized}} what his brother had to face, and wished that he had gone on the quest himself — knowing that Boromir {{would not have been able}} to resist the <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> seize the Ring for himself. Giving the Hobbits provisions, he sent them on their way to continue their quest, but warned Frodo that their guide, Gollum, was a treacherous creature, and that an unknown terror lived in Cirith Ungol, where Gollum was leading them.|$|E
5|$|The Dark Tower reveals more of Flagg’s background, {{relating}} that he {{was born}} Walter Padick in Delain to Sam the Miller of Eastar’d Barony. At age 13 Walter set out for a life on the road, but was raped by a fellow wanderer; author Bev Vincent hypothesized in The Road to the Dark Tower that Flagg's later actions towards Delain in The Eyes of the Dragon may have been revenge for the abuse he suffered as a child. Resisting the <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> crawl back home, Padick instead moves towards his destiny; he learns various forms of magic, achieving a quasi-immortality. After centuries of wreaking havoc Flagg attracts {{the attention of the}} Crimson King, who adopts him as his emissary.|$|E

In A Mother and Two Daughters {{the main character}} resists the <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> get married and chooses instead to focus on her work. A Mother and Two Daughters and A Southern Family (1987) each depend heavily on a southern setting and employ themes traditionally associated with social problems in the South. Some of their themes include racial discrimination, social-economic class and the cultural differences between generations. Many characters struggle to reduce {{the gap between the}} rich and poor or try to break free from a dominant cultural tradition, with mixed success.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, the Indian media {{reported}} that Mahesh Bhatt and Bhushan Kumar were keen {{to remake the}} 1990 musical blockbuster Aashiqui. Kumar approached Bhatt for a possible sequel, although it was Shagufta Rafique's melodramatic romantic script which persuaded him that the film had potential as a sequel and decided {{to proceed with the}} project. Given Aashiqui 's status in Hindi cinematic history as one of the finest Indian musicals of all time, many expressed concerns towards the decision to remake the film, dubious that the producers could come up with a soundtrack on par with the quality of the 1990 film. Bhatt stated that they completely resisted the <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> use the soundtrack of the earlier film, and promised that Aashiqui 2 would revive the era of melodious film music, as Aashiqui had done 22 years ago.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Cavalry Division {{arrived in}} Australia and {{continued}} its training at Strathpine, Queensland. Training {{there was more}} vigorous than at Fort Bliss, and Chase broke his heel bone in a training accident. In December 1943, the 1st Cavalry Division sailed for Oro Bay, where it staged for its next operation, the Admiralty Islands campaign. Chase was chosen to lead the assault. Here, his tactical expertise came to the fore. He resisted the <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> overrun the island of Los Negros, and thereby overextend his forces, and instead formed a defensive perimeter that made good use of the terrain. From this position, {{he was able to}} defeat a series of counterattacks by the numerically superior Japanese garrison. The crisis passed, Chase's force was reinforced {{by the rest of the}} division, and the 1st Cavalry Division was then able to overrun the islands. Chase was awarded the Bronze Star for his role in the campaign.|$|E

5|$|The 1969–70 season {{opened with}} {{victory in the}} 1969 FA Charity Shield, as Bremner captained Leeds to a 2–1 victory over Manchester City. With new arrival Allan Clarke played upfront {{alongside}} Mick Jones and Peter Lorimer Revie had to instruct Bremner and Giles to resist the <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> get forward and attack. It took the team some time to gel, as only two wins came from the opening eight league games, and Leeds eventually finished a distant second to champions Everton. They chased Everton all season only {{to give up on}} the title after a home defeat by Southampton late in the campaign. In the European Cup Leeds recorded a club record 10–0 win over Norwegian side Lyn, with Bremner netting two of the goals. However they exited the competition at the semi-final stage after two defeats to Celtic; Bremner levelled the aggregate score by putting United 1–0 ahead in front of a competition record 136,505 spectators at Hampden Park, but Celtic came back to win the game and the tie with two second half goals. Further disappointment came in the 1970 FA Cup Final, where Leeds were beaten 2–1 in extra-time of the replay at Old Trafford. Bremner was named as FWA Footballer of the Year for the season.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Cigarette smoking {{initiation}} remains {{prevalent in}} adolescence. Effective prevention methods {{are needed to}} dissuade this behavior. Demographic factors are identified as important risk factors in the developmental nature of smoking in adolescence. The current study investigates potential demographic differences for two new trans-theoretical model measures, the Decisional Balance Inventory (pros and cons) for Smoking Prevention and the Temptationsto Try Smoking Scale. Methods A sample of 6 th grade Rhode Island students from 20 middle schools (N = 4151) who were participating in a longitudinal and computer-delivered intervention for substance abuse prevention was assessed on these measures at baseline. Three MANOVA tests were conducted {{to assess the impact}} of race (White vs. Non-White), ethnicity (Hispanic vs. Non-Hispanic) and gender (male vs female). Results Significant effects for race and ethnicity were found for Decisional Balance and <b>Temptations</b> <b>to</b> Try Smoking. For race, Whites reported lesser pros (p <. 0001) and Non-Whites reported higher cons (p <. 0001) and <b>temptations</b> <b>to</b> try smoking (p <. 0001). Differences for ethnicity showed that Hispanics were higher on pros (p <. 0001) and <b>temptations</b> <b>to</b> try smoking (p <. 0001) than Non-Hispanics. Non-Hispanics reported higher cons (p <. 0001). Gender differences were noted only for <b>temptations</b> <b>to</b> try smoking, and showed females were higher on this construct than males (p <. 0001). The effect sizes were. 01 or below. Conclusions The results did not demonstrate a strong association between these demographics and constructs, suggesting that tailored prevention methods based solely on these factors may not dissuade smoking in this group...|$|R

25|$|In some Native American cultures, severe {{penalties}} {{could be}} imposed on an adulterous wife by her husband.

40|$|Andrew von Hirsch and Andrew Ashworth {{recently}} {{argued that}} there is generally a reason to punish a socially deprived offender less than his non-deprived counterpart (ie {{someone who is not}} socially deprived but is otherwise similar to the deprived offender in that he committed the same crime, caused the same harm, with the same degree of foresight, etc), because deprived offenders generally face stronger <b>temptations</b> <b>to</b> offend than their non-deprived counterparts. In reply, I will argue that we should draw a distinction between (i) facing stronger <b>temptations</b> <b>to</b> offend when one offended and (ii) acting on stronger temptations in offending. The distinction is analogous to Antony Duff's distinction between having a reason for an action and acting on/for that reason. After drawing the distinction, I will argue that while acting on stronger temptations in offending should be a mitigating factor, facing stronger <b>temptations</b> <b>to</b> offend per se should not be a mitigating factor. Moreover, I will argue that since it is not true that deprived offenders generally act on stronger temptations in offending, social deprivation cannot be defended as a general mitigating plea on the basis that deprived offenders generally act on stronger temptations in offending. © The Author 2010.

The poorly paid officers often pocketed funds for soldiers {{who were on the}} muster rolls but absent or non-existent.
