The hardware {{and operation of}} the HWCVD production reactor is {{compared to that of}} existing roll-to-roll reactors based on Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition. The most important consequences are the technical consequences and the economic consequences, which are both discussed. The technical consequences are adaptations needed to the hardware and to the processing sequences due to the different interaction of the HWCVD process with the substrate and already deposited layers. The economic consequences are the reduced investments in radio frequency (RF) supplies and RF components. This is partially offset by investments that have to be made in higher capacity pumping systems. The most mature applications of HWCVD are moisture barrier coatings for <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> flexible devices such as Organic Light Emitting Diodes and Organic Photovoltaics, and passivation layers for multicrystalline Si solar cells, high mobility field effect transistors, and silicon heterojunction cells (also known as heterojunction cells with intrinsic <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> layers).

40|$|Particulates {{suspended}} in plasma can be sized in situ using the scattering ratio method, which involves measuring {{the ratio of}} the parallel and perpendicular polarizations of light scattered at 90 #. This method of plasma monitoring is of interest for controlling contamination of silicon wafers and other <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>products</b> during plasma etching and deposition procedures. For parameters typical of plasma processing, we report Mie scattering computations to test the method's sensitivity to the optical design and to uncertainties in the particle parameters. A error in the size determination can result either from an either in the real or in the imaginary part of the refractive index or from a particle shape that deviates significantly from a sphere. A error results from a 0. 1 # error in aligning the scattering angle. To measure particulate diameters as small as 0. 05 m, the detector solid angle should be < 10 - 5 Sr and the extinction ratio of the polarizer must be < 10 - 4. A calculation of the signal-to-noise ratio reveals that it is untenably weak for particle diameters smaller than about 0. 04 m. The scattering ratio method is usually inapplicable for polydisperse particulates, but it will still work in many cases for many plasma applications, in which particles stratify in different layers according to their size...|$|E
40|$|Beside {{the layer}} quality a good {{adhesion}} between coating and polymer substrate is {{a precondition for}} the manufacture of quality <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>products.</b> Due to the inertness of most polymer surfaces an appropriate treatment of substrates prior deposition is necessary. Typical examples for the necessity of pretreatment are the deposition of barrier layers on BOPP film and the deposition of layer systems on organic hardcoat for window films. The classic methods are the corona treatment as a separate step prior vacuum coating and the plasma (glow discharge) treatment as in-line process. However, we could show that energetic ion bombardment typical for sputter etching processes is superior to simple plasma treatment in many applications. Two technical solutions for the pretreatment of substrates by sputter etching will be presented. The Web Treater uses an asymmetric RF discharge to power a plasma and to maintain an energetic ion bombardment also for electrically insulating substrates without restrictions in film thickness. MF bias treatment is a method suitable especially for plastic film substrates up to 100 micrometers thick. High treatment doses can be achieved due to the large treatment area. Both methods combine the surface activation effects by plasma radicals and radiation with the particle removal and cross linking action caused by energetic ion bombardment. Since electrical substrate charging is avoided by nature additional neutralizer is not necessary...|$|E

The nitrogen content of the DPNR was reduced to 0. 05 wt%, which was lower than 0. 45 wt% of HA-NR under the test condition. The reduction of protein content can be confirmed by observation a chemical structure through FT-IR technique. It is suggesting that the urea treatment is an effective method to remove protein from rubber latex. Then, physical properties of the DPNR latex were investigated. Amount of water soluble protein was observed through modified lowry method and it was found that water soluble protein content after incubation HA-NR with urea was reduced to 15 g/g (DPNR) from 4, 245 g/g (HA-NR). It was found that VFA number of DPNR was lower than that of HA-NR due to lower amount of protein presence in rubber latex. The particle size and charge of rubber latex was examined by dynamic light scattering and zeta potential to compare between un-vulcanized latex and vulcanized latex. The mechanical properties were then observed when we applied the DPNR latex to vulcanized rubber glove...|$|E

40|$|Wet gas {{corrosion}} {{rates of}} C 1018 and X 65 steel have been {{measured at the}} top and bottom of a high pressure, 10 cm diameter horizontal pipeline under stratified flow conditions with different chloride (Cl-) concentrations. Experiments were performed for 200 hours at 90 °C, CO 2 partial pressure of 3. 8 bar using a superficial gas velocity (Vsg) of 10 m/s and a superficial liquid velocity (Vsl) of 0. 1 m/s. Three measurement techniques; ER, LPR, and WL were used simultaneously in the experiments. Localized corrosion occurred at the bottom of the pipe around the iron saturation point. The top of line was well protected by a <b>thin</b> corrosion <b>product</b> <b>film</b> and no localized corrosion was detected. C 1018 and X 65 have different sensitivities to pitting with a variation in Cl- concentration. Thus the pitting density concept is proposed to describe localized corrosion behavior. Surface analysis on iron carbonate films, by SEM and XRD, revealed different film thicknesses and crystal structures from the top to the bottom of the pipe. Cross-sectional analysis indicates that the <b>thin</b> corrosion <b>product</b> <b>film,</b> usually less than 10 microns, attached to the metal surface, is responsible for the low corrosion rate on top of the line, while the thick and porous film formed on the bottom, generally detached from the metal surface, was responsible for the initiation of localized corrosion...|$|R
30|$|The erosion {{corrosion}} mechanism {{increases corrosion}} reaction rate by continuously removing the passive layer of corrosion {{products from the}} wall of the pipe. The passive layer is a <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> of corrosion <b>product</b> that actually serves to stabilize the corrosion reaction and slow it down. As a result of the turbulence and high shear stress in the line, this passive layer can be removed, causing the corrosion rate to increase [33]. The erosion corrosion is always experienced where there is high turbulence flow regime with significantly higher rate of corrosion [34] and is dependent on fluid flow rate and the density and morphology of solids present in the fluid [20]. High velocities and presence of abrasive suspended material and the corrodents in drilling and produced fluids contribute to this destructive process. This form of corrosion is often overlooked or recognized as being caused by wear [35].|$|R
40|$|Defects {{caused by}} {{particulate}} contamination {{are an important}} concern in the fabrication of <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>products.</b> Often, magnetron sputtering processes are used for this purpose. Particle contamination can cause electrical shorting, pin holes, problems with photolithography, adhesion failure, as well as visual and cosmetic defects. Particle contamination generated during thin film processing can be detected using laser light scattering, a powerful diagnostic technique that provides real-time, {ital in-situ} imaging of particles > 0. 3 {mu}m in diameter. Using this technique, the causes, sources and influences on particles in plasma and non-plasma and non-plasma processes may be independently evaluated and corrected. Several studies employing laser light scattering have demonstrated both homogeneous and heterogeneous causes of particle contamination. In this paper, we demonstrate that the mechanisms for particle generation, transport and trapping during magnetron sputter deposition {{are different from the}} mechanisms reported in previously studied plasma etch processes. During magnetron sputter deposition, one source of particle contamination is linked to portions of the sputtering target surface exposed to weaker plasma density. In this region, film redeposition is followed by filament or nodule growth and enhanced trapping which increases filament growth. Eventually the filaments effectively ``short circuit`` the sheath, causing high currents to flow through these features. This, in turn, causes heating failure of the filament fracturing and ejecting the filaments into the plasma and onto the substrate. Evidence of this effect has been observed in semiconductor (IC) fabrication and storage disk manufacturing. Discovery of this mechanism in both technologies suggests that this mechanism may be universal to many sputtering processes...|$|E
40|$|Reinforcement {{of natural}} rubber latex (NRL) is {{essential}} for NRL based <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>products</b> manufacture. Silica {{is one of the}} most important reinforcing fillers used in dry rubber industry. However, the surface bound silanol groups that are polar and considerably chemically active, make silica less compatible with NRL. In the present study, surface of precipitated silica (Ultrasil VN 3) is modified with macromolecular coupling agents (MCAs) consisting of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups and the surface modified silica is incorporated into NRL in order to reinforce NRL films which is a novel concept introduced to confer interactions between silica-MCA complex and rubber particles. The MCAs are synthesized in the laboratory by a solution polymerization technique using hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers. Surface modification of precipitated silica particles with the MCAs is carried out in two reaction mediums; aqueous and non-aqueous, separately. Unmodified/ modified silica is added as aqueous dispersions at neutral pH to compounded and uncompounded NRL in four different levels of loadings from 5 phr to 20 phr in 5 increments. Thin latex films are cast from compounded/uncompounded NRL filled with unmodified and modified fillers. Formation of H-bonds and/or covalent bonds between carboxylic groups of MCA and hydroxyl groups of silica is studied via FTIR spectroscopy and contribution of newly formed bonds in enhancing filler-rubber interactions is emphasized through mechanical, thermal and swelling properties. Microstructures of film cross sections of filler added NRL obtained from SEM and optical microscope confirm the uniform dispersion of modified filler particles throughout the rubber matrix. Tear strength and tensile strength are found to be increased by 50 % and 35 % respectively at 5 - 10 phr of filler loading of vulcanized films filled with filler modified by the most hydrophilic MCA compared with those of UM filler added vulcanizates.

40|$|TiO 2 (B) or “bronze” is a TiO 2 {{polymorph}} {{which is}} difficult to synthesise in a pure form and does not commonly exist in minerals. TiO 2 (B) potentially {{plays an important role}} in applications both as a photocatalytic component alongside anatase for degradation reactions and as an anode material in lithium ion batteries due to its distinctive crystal structure which exhibits large channels and voids. In this research, TiO 2 (B) has been successfully synthesised by both a hydrothermal route and a Low Pressure Chemical Vapour Deposition (LPCVD) process. Samples were characterised using powder-XRD, Raman spectroscopy, TEM, SEM and UV-Vis spectroscopy. Phase formation mechanisms for both the hydrothermal route and LPCVD process have been proposed. Initially, in order to investigate the TiO 2 (B) phase formation mechanism via a sodium titanate phase transformation, hydrothermal synthesis was employed to produce TiO 2 (B) nanorods including an investigation of the products at each stage of the reaction. The results were used to propose an integrated reaction mechanism which corresponds well with literature. This involved the structural transformation of a sodium titanate intermediate phase which is of interest in relation to the other TiO 2 (B) fabrication methods where Na+ ions are present in the system such as CVD on glass substrates. As a result, the synthesis of mixed phase TiO 2 (B) and anatase thin films on a soda lime glass substrate has been achieved, for the first time, by LPCVD synthesis. Titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) and N 2 gas were used as the precursor and carrier gas respectively. The optimal LPCVD condition for preparing a mixed phase of TiO 2 containing TiO 2 (B) was 550 oC (actual temperature) with a 1 mL/s N 2 flow rate. A possible thin-film formation mechanism during the LPCVD process has been proposed. Subsequently a pre-treatment method involving spraying a Na+-containing solution, such as sodium ethoxide, onto a number of different substrates including silicon wafer, fused quartz, highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and pressed graphite flake (grafoil) was applied in conjunction with the LPCVD method in order to promote the TiO 2 (B) phase in the <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>products</b> formed on any substrate. Finally, the effects of different alkali metal ions (Li+, Na+ and K+ from alkali metal hydroxide solutions) during the pre-treatment step were investigated in relation to the phase formation in the thin films produced during the LPCVD process. Only Na+ ions were found to encourage the phase formation of TiO 2 (B), K+ ions produced only a minority of the TiO 2 (B) phase, whereas Li+ ions did not produce TiO 2 (B). Phase formation mechanisms have been proposed based on alkali metal migration from the pre-treatment layer into the deposited nascent titania film and the formation of intermediate titanate phases. ...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2018 In this dissertation, the spectroscopic {{properties}} and thermodynamic stability {{of a class}} of materials known as metal oxo and hydroxo clusters are studied. In aqueous solutions, many metals can aggregate into discrete clusters of metals bridged by oxo or hydroxo ligands. These clusters are {{of particular interest to}} us for their use as precursors for metal oxide thin films. Understanding the stability of these clusters, along with distinguishing ways to uniquely identify particular clusters via spectroscopy, is vital to improving the quality of cluster precursors and the metal oxide <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>products.</b> Vibrational spectroscopy is an appealing technique for the identification of cluster species because of the relative ease to collect experimental IR and Raman spectra. However, uniquely identifying cluster vibrations is difficult due to the similarity of ligands types and vibrational modes between different clusters. Disclosed herein are two studies of vibrational spectroscopy applied to metal hydroxo clusters of Group 13 metals. These studies focus on one cluster structure in particular, the flat tridecamer, M 13 (OH) 24 (H 2 O) 2415 +, where M= Al 3 + or Ga 3 +. The vibrations of the NO 3 - counterions used in these studies overlap with the frequencies associated with cluster vibration, which limits the uniqueness of the Raman and IR signals. Nonetheless, full assignment of peaks was made for solid state and solution phase flat tridecamers. NMR spectroscopy is an appealing technique for the identification and characterization of cluster species because of the amount of structural information that can be gleaned from NMR spectra. In one study, we used 1 H-NMR to characterize flat tridecamers with a mixture of gallium and indium. Computations struggle to predict NMR spectra because these spectra reflect average structures over time, and static computations rely on single structures and are especially sensitive to small deviations in atom positions. In this study, we computed the 1 H-NMR signals for the flat tridecamers Ga 13 -xInx(OH) 24 (H 2 O) 2415 +, and fully assigned the experimental proton signals to each proton coordination environment that is possible for these clusters. Quantum mechanical computations {{can also be used to}} understand the stability of different cluster species relative to each other. In this dissertation, the stability of Al, Ga, and Hf clusters is explored. Hf tetramer clusters, Hf 4 (OH) 8 (H 2 O) 168 +, were examined with peroxide substitution for a pair of hydroxide or water ligands. These calculations suggest that peroxide prefers to substitute for the terminal water ligands versus the bridging hydroxide ligands. This study also highlights the importance of accurate solvation models for computing the structures and stabilities of clusters in aqueous solutions. For the Group 13 metals aluminum and gallium, the stability of different clusters can be computed based on the identity and binding modes of the different ligands. Using ligand identities to compute hydrolysis energies can reproduce quantum mechanical computations of cluster stability with extremely high accuracy. However, these calculations do not include the cluster counterions, which can affect the stability of high-charge clusters. For a full determination of cluster speciation in solution, counterions are required for accurate speciation across all possible species. The speciation and structural conformations of Al clusters was studied with Cl-, NO 3 -, HSO 4 -, and ClO 4 - counterions...|$|E

These enhancements are attributed to the nanoporosities in the Pt 0. 52 Al 0. 48 <b>thin</b> <b>films.</b> The nanoporous Pt <b>thin</b> <b>films,</b> after the complete dissolution of Al, exhibited approximately one order of magnitude larger electrochemical surface area than Pt <b>thin</b> <b>films.</b> Superior methanol-oxidation activities were also observed in the nanoporous Pt <b>thin</b> <b>films...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractCurrent methodologies {{used for}} the {{inference}} of <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> stress through curvature measurement are strictly restricted to stress and curvature states that are assumed to remain uniform over the entire film/substrate system. These methodologies have recently been extended to a single layer of <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> deposited on a substrate subjected to the non-uniform misfit strain in the <b>thin</b> <b>film.</b> Such methodologies are further extended to multi-layer <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> deposited on a substrate in the present study. Each <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> may have its own non-uniform misfit strain. We derive relations between the stresses in each <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> and the change of system curvatures due to the deposition of each <b>thin</b> <b>film.</b> The interface shear stresses between the adjacent films and between the <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> and the substrate are also obtained from the system curvatures. This provides {{the basis for the}} experimental determination of <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> stresses in multi-layer <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> on a substrate...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} with pureed pumpkin to evaluate energy efficiency and microbial reduction effect of a new thin-film drying method, Refractance Window ™ (RW) drying method. RW drying system was designed based on a novel concept that uses hot water circulating beneath and in contact with a transparent plastic conveyor belt on which a <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> of pureed <b>product</b> is dried. In the energy study, heating water temperature, water circulation velocity, product temperature, and product moisture content were measured. In both pilot and commercial scale RW dryers with circulation water at 95 ºC drying of pumpkin puree from 80 % to 5 % moisture content (wet basis) was achieved in less than 5 minutes. The Refractance Window™ dryer demonstrated 52 % to 70 % energy efficiency. The pilot scale unit {{was used to evaluate}} the effect of RW drying on microbial reduction. At a circulating water temperature of 95 oC, RW drying of inoculated pumpkin purees resulted in at least 4. 6, 6. 1, 6. 0, and 5. 5 log reductions of total aerobic plate counts (APC), coliforms, Escherichia coli, and Listeria innocua, respectively...|$|R

However, no significant roughness was observed for the x[*]=[*] 0.09 <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> (RMS roughness of 0.3  nm). It means that the x[*]=[*] 0.35 <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> had more surface roughness than the x[*]=[*] 0.09 <b>thin</b> <b>film.</b> The annealed <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> with x[*]=[*] 0.09 had large frequency dispersion. However, the annealed <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> with x[*]=[*] 0.35 showed small frequency dispersion. By comparing these results from the C-V measurements, {{it has led to}} the conclusion that the surface roughness was not responsible for the observed frequency dispersion of the high-k dielectric <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> (La [...]...|$|R
