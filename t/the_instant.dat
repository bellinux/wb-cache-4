40|$|Abstract—This letter {{proposes a}} time-effective method for {{determining}} <b>the</b> <b>instants</b> of significant excitation in speech signals. <b>The</b> <b>instants</b> of significant excitation correspond to <b>the</b> <b>instants</b> of glottal closure (epochs) {{in the case}} of voiced speech, and to some random excitations like onset of burst {{in the case of}} nonvoiced speech. The proposed method consists of two phases: the first phase determines the approximate epoch locations using the Hilbert envelope of the linear prediction residual of the speech signal. The second phase determines the accurate locations of <b>the</b> <b>instants</b> of significant excitation by computing the group delay around the approximate epoch locations derived from the first phase.

5|$|A key {{development}} of the testing program was a miss-distance indicator system, which independently measured {{the distance between the}} Zeus and the target at <b>the</b> <b>instant</b> the computers initiated the detonation of the warhead. There were concerns that if the Zeus' own radars were used for this ranging measure, any systematic error in ranging would also be present in the test data, and thus would be hidden. The solution was the use of a separate UHF-frequency transmitter in the warhead reentry vehicle, and a receiver in the Zeus. The received signal was retransmitted to the ground, where its Doppler shift was examined to extract the range information. These instruments eventually demonstrated that the Zeus' own tracking information was accurate. For visual tracking, a small conventional warhead was used, which provided a flash that could be seen on long exposure photographs of the interceptions.|$|E

5|$|The two-colored bolete is an edible mushroom, {{although}} some {{may have an}} allergic reaction after ingestion that results in stomach upset. The mushroom has a very mild to no taste although {{it is said to}} have a very distinctive taste like that of the king bolete.

If the cap is a lighter red, then it is less mature and is in a stage where it is often larva infested or it can be soft fleshed, in some cases both. The cap should have a dark brick red color when safe to eat. Drying the two-colored bolete is a good method for storage. It is important to note the time it takes for the two-colored bolete to bruise when identifying it for consumption; the mushroom should take several minutes to bruise compared to <b>the</b> <b>instant</b> bruising of Boletus sensibilis, which is poisonous and has many of the same visual characteristics of the two-colored bolete.|$|E

5|$|Because A Trip to the Moon {{preceded the}} {{development}} of narrative film editing by filmmakers such as Edwin S. Porter and D. W. Griffith, it does not use the cinematic vocabulary to which American and European audiences later became accustomed, a vocabulary built on the purposeful use of techniques such as varied camera angles, intercutting, juxtapositions of shots, and other filmic ideas. Rather, each camera setup in Méliès's film is designed as a distinct dramatic scene uninterrupted by visible editing, an approach fitting the theatrical style in which the film was designed. Similarly, film scholars have noted that the most famous moment in A Trip to the Moon plays with temporal continuity by showing an event twice: first the capsule is shown suddenly appearing {{in the eye of}} an anthropomorphic moon; then, in a much closer shot, the landing occurs very differently, and much more realistically, with the capsule actually plummeting into believable lunar terrain. This kind of nonlinear storytelling—in which time and space are treated as repeatable and flexible rather than linear and causal—is highly unconventional by the standards of Griffith and his followers; before {{the development of}} continuity editing, however, other filmmakers performed similar experiments with time. (Porter, for instance, used temporal discontinuity and repetition extensively in his 1903 film Life of an American Fireman.) Later in the twentieth century, with sports television's development of <b>the</b> <b>instant</b> replay, temporal repetition again became a familiar device to screen audiences.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Prosody {{modification}} involves {{changing the}} pitch {{and duration of}} speech without affecting the message and naturalness. This paper proposes a method for prosody (pitch and duration) modification using <b>the</b> <b>instants</b> of significant excitation of the vocal tract system during the production of speech. <b>The</b> <b>instants</b> of signifi-cant excitation correspond to <b>the</b> <b>instants</b> of glottal closure (epochs) {{in the case of}} voiced speech, and to some random excitations like onset of burst in the case of nonvoiced speech. Instants of significant excitation are computed from the linear prediction (LP) residual of speech signals by using the property of average group-delay of minimum phase signals. The modification of pitch and duration is achieved by manipulating the LP residual {{with the help of the}} knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>instants</b> of significant excitation. The modified residual is used to excite the time-varying filter, whose parameters are derived from the original speech signal. Perceptual quality of the synthesized speech is good and is without any significant distor-tion. The proposed method is evaluated using waveforms, spectro-grams, and listening tests. The performance of the method is com-pared with linear prediction pitch synchronous overlap and add (LP-PSOLA) method, which is another method for prosody ma-nipulation based on the modification of the LP residual.
