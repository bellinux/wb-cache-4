5|$|As a spouse, surgeon, and mother, Meredith has cited {{a number}} times {{that she did}} not want to be like either of her parents: her father had {{followed}} her mother around pathetically before leaving to be happy, while her mother valued her career over her family. Meredith is frequently conflicted <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>balance</b> between the two, and fears her family are hindering her medical aspirations, as much as she fears becoming like her mother whenever she's tempted to choose surgery over family. Meredith and Cristina have a huge rift when Cristina confirms Meredith's fears by stating that Meredith's skills have fallen behind Cristina's due to her familial obligations taking her away from OR time.|$|E

Gelfer explained that they are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>balance</b> between their will to fight against cheaters and at the same time not to create an unhealthy atmosphere in the chess world. The usual electronic scans before and after the game were of course prescribed, while novel procedures included: having a special anti-cheating arbiter (Klaus Deventer) with approximately 15 arbiters under his authority, one of whose charges was to carry out 30–40 checks during the round; and that players MUST inform their Match Arbiter when leaving the playing area.|$|E

Some critics attributed the proposal to the California Correctional Peace Officers Associations donations to Davis' re-election campaign.|$|E
25|$|On June 22, 2016, guitarist Williamson made an {{official}} statement {{for the band}} saying that the Stooges are no more."The Stooges is over. Basically, everybody's dead except Iggy and I.

25|$|In {{the first}} G.I. Joe miniseries The MASS Device, Duke is the field leader of G.I. Joe, {{under the command}} of General Flagg. Though the comic books and file cards say Duke is from St. Louis, Missouri, The MASS Device miniseries said that Duke was from Iowa. By the {{beginning}} of the first season of , the role of commanding officer frequently alternated between Duke and Flint, the warrant officer who was introduced in The Revenge of Cobra miniseries.

Boys viewed having sex as social capital. Many boys believed that their male peers who were abstinent would not as easily climb the social ladder as sexually active boys.

25|$|The New Deal tried public works, farm subsidies, {{and other}} devices to reduce unemployment, but Roosevelt never {{completely}} gave up <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>balance</b> the budget. Between 1933 and 1941 the average federal budget deficit was 3% per year. Roosevelt did not fully utilize deficit spending. The effects of federal public works spending were largely offset by Herbert Hoover's large tax increase in 1932, whose full effects {{for the first time}} were felt in 1933, and it was undercut by spending cuts, especially the Economy Act. According to Keynesians like Paul Krugman the New Deal therefore was not as successful in the short run {{as it was in the}} long run.|$|E

25|$|The {{relations}} between Israel and the United States have evolved from an initial United States policy of sympathy {{and support for}} the creation of a Jewish state in 1948 (It was the first country to recognize the establishment of the State) to an unusual partnership that links Israel with the United States <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>balance</b> competing interests in the Middle East region. The United States has been considered Israel's most powerful and supportive ally and hosts the annual Salute to Israel Parade in New York City.

25|$|During 1966 and 1967 {{it became}} obvious to MACV that the North Vietnamese were using neutral Cambodia {{as a part of}} their {{logistical}} system, funneling men and supplies to the southernmost seat of battle. The unknown factor was the how much use the enemy was making of Cambodia. The answer shocked even the most hardened intelligence analysts. Prince Norodom Sihanouk, desperately <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>balance</b> the threats facing his nation, had allowed Hanoi to set up a presence in Cambodia. Although the extension of Laotian Highway 110 into Cambodia in the tri-border region was an improvement to its logistical system, North Vietnam was now unloading communist-flagged transports in the port of Sihanoukville and simply trucking its supplies to its Base Areas on the eastern border.|$|E
25|$|He was not {{initially}} appointed as Governor of the Colony of Vancouver Island; the position instead went to Richard Blanshard, an English barrister. But, most practical authority rested with Douglas {{as the chief}} employer and person in charge of its finances and land, and he effectively drove Blanshard from the position. Douglas acknowledged the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and had a policy to trade the natives for their land. Costs for each parcel of land were usually {{in the form of}} blankets, often three for each man. This policy also stemmed from a desire to have good interactions with natives while avoiding violence. After Blanshard resigned in 1851, the British Government appointed Douglas as the Governor of Vancouver Island. As he was still Chief Factor of the HBC, for several years he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>balance</b> his important and time-consuming duties of both positions.

500|$|Reaction to this {{digital rights}} {{management}} scheme was extremely negative. Critics felt that the changes would infringe on consumers' first-sale rights for games purchased on physical media, as games would only be licensed to users rather than sold, and the disc itself would only be used to install the game and not confer ownership of its license or permission to resell. Microsoft also stated that publishers could impose restrictions or activation fees on second-hand copies of games. Xbox Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer Yusuf Mehdi explained that the system was built with digital distribution in mind, but that Microsoft wanted to maintain the availability of games on physical media. He also noted that Microsoft was not [...] "giving in" [...] to publishers' objections to used games, but rather <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>balance</b> the needs of consumers and the industry, and that the trading and sharing abilities of the platform added a level of flexibility not seen on other online distribution platforms at the time.|$|E
