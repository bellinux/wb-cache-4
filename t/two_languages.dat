5|$|By 1980 he was {{a popular}} actor in the South Indian cinema. During this phase of his career, Rajinikanth {{abruptly}} chose to quit acting, but was coaxed to return with the Tamil film Billa, a remake of the Bollywood film Don (1978). It had Rajinikanth playing dual roles and eventually became his first ever commercial success. His pairing with Sridevi continued in Johnny, where he was once again cast in a double role. He also starred in Murattu Kaalai which was a commercial success. In 1981, he appeared in Garjanai which was shot simultaneously in Kannada and Malayalam, making it his last film in those <b>two</b> <b>languages</b> to date. In K. Balachander's first home production, Netrikan, he played dual roles as a womanising father and a responsible son. His first full-length comedy was Thillu Mullu, directed by K. Balachander. He agreed to it solely due to the strong suggestion by his mentor that he should do non-commercial roles, to break the stereotyped action-hero mould by which he was getting famous at the time. 1981 also saw the release of Thee, the remake of Amitabh Bachchan's 1975 blockbuster Deewar, in which Rajinikanth reprised the role of Bachchan in the original. In 1982, he starred in Pokkiri Raja, Moondru Mugam, Thanikattu Raja, Puthukavithai and Enkeyo Ketta Kural. Moondru Mugam had Rajinikanth playing three roles for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The Western Gangas used Kannada and Sanskrit {{extensively}} {{as their}} language of administration. Some of their inscriptions are also bilingual in these languages. In bilingual inscriptions the formulaic passages stating origin myths, genealogies, titles of Kings and benedictions {{tended to be}} in Sanskrit, while the actual terms of the grant such as information on the land or village granted, its boundaries, participation of local authorities, rights and obligations of the grantee, taxes and dues and other local concerns were in the local language. The usage of these <b>two</b> <b>languages</b> showed important changes over the centuries. During the first phase (350–725), Sanskrit copper plates dominated, indicating the initial ascendancy of the local language as a language of administration {{and the fact that}} majority of the records from this phase were brahmadeya grants (grants to Brahmin temples). In the second phase (725–1000), lithic inscriptions in Kannada outnumbered Sanskrit copper plates, consistent with the patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains who used Kannada as their medium to spread the Jain faith. Recent excavations at Tumbula near Mysore have revealed a set of early copper plate bilingual inscriptions dated 444. The genealogy of the kings of the dynasty is described in Sanskrit while Kannada was used to describe the boundary of the village. An interesting inscription discovered at Beguru near modern Bangalore that deserves mention is the epigraph dated 890 that refers to a Bengaluru war. This is in Hale Kannada (old Kannada) language and is the earliest mention of the name of Bangalore city. The Western Gangas minted coins with Kannada and Nagari legends, the most common feature on their coins was the image of an elephant on the obverse and floral petal symbols on the reverse. The Kannada legend Bhadr, a royal umbrella or a conch shell appeared on top of the elephant image. The denominations are the pagoda (weighing 52 grains), the fanam weighting one tenth or one half of the pagoda and the quarter fanams.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{corporate}} {{images of the}} leading auditing firms in Belgium, focussing on {{the perceptions of the}} <b>two</b> <b>language</b> groupings in Belgium, the Dutch speaking Flemings and the French speaking Walloons. Our major objective is to assess whether there are differences in the corporate images of a company's audit firm that {{can be attributed to the}} differing self-images of Flemings and Walloons. The corporate image of the audit firms was ascertained by using a semantic differential measuring instrument, which contained a number of anthropomorphic dimensions. Based on a review of the literature concerning the images and cultures of the <b>two</b> <b>language</b> groupings, we develop hypotheses of an association between these anthropomorphic dimensions of corporate image and the images and culture of the <b>two</b> <b>language</b> groupings. We obtained an assessment of the dimensions of corporate image via a postal questionnaire to financial executives of leading Belgium companies. Our analysis of the data shows that there is a relationship between the images and culture of the <b>two</b> <b>language</b> groupings, but that the relationship is an inverse one, whereby an attribute that is associated more with one of the <b>two</b> <b>language</b> groups is assessed by a respondent from that language group to be less in his or her audit firm. The paper also shows that the Big Five are perceived differently to each other by the <b>two</b> <b>language</b> groupings and that the Walloons perceive bigger differences amongst the Big Five than do the Flemings. 2 Corporate Images of Audit Firms in a Multilingual Society: "Jack wold be a gentilman if he could speke frensske" (English medieval proverb cited by F.
