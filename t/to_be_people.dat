Woodyatt confirmed his desire to remain with the show in 2010, during the show's 25th anniversary: [...] "Why would I want to leave when I'm {{not going to get the}} chance to portray even half the range of emotions I get to here in a one-off drama or a six-part series?

What we love about this particular set of heroes is that they're a little more down to Earth. Costume wise and also in that these are gritty crime stories, more in the streets than in the clouds." [...] Elaborating on this, DeKnight said, [...] "It is a little grittier and edgier than Marvel has gone before, but we're not looking to push it to extreme graphic violence, gratuitous nudity or anything like that. The story does not require that and I think [...] would suffer if you pushed it that far."

Today, we live in the Bible-Talmud-Qur'an-Veda-Dhammapada-Guru Granth Sahib-Kitabi Iqan Belt.

[...] The executive director of FaithAction (an interfaith organization) Rev. Mark Sills, signed the letter and said that the Qur'an oath case [...] "struck us as an issue that needs to be confronted". He asked Christians to {{imagine what it would be}} like to live in a place where the Bible was not allowed for oaths, saying [...] "That just feels like a slap in the face." [...] Rev. Julie Peeples, pastor of Greensboro's Congregational United Church of Christ, signed the letter and said [...] "I think it's an opportunity to foster greater respect for all the traditions we have in Greensboro."
