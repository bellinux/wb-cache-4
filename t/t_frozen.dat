40|$|We {{describe}} {{a strategy to}} “revive” putatively pathogenic <b>T</b> cells from <b>frozen</b> specimens of human inflammatory target organs. To distinguish pathogenic from irrelevant bystander T cells, we focused on cells that were (i) clonally expanded and (ii) in direct morphological contact with a target cell. Using CDR 3 spectratyping, we identified clonally expanded T cell receptor (TCR) β-chains in muscle sections of patients with inflammatory muscle diseases. By immunohistochemistry, we identified those Vβ-positive T cells that fulfilled the morphological criteria of myocytotoxicity and isolated them by laser microdissection. Next, we identified coexpressed pairs of TCR α- and β-chains by a multiplex PCR protocol, which allows the concomitant amplification of both chains from single cells. This concomitant amplification had not been achieved previously in histological sections, {{mainly because of the}} paucity of available anti-α-chain antibodies and the great heterogeneity of the α-chain genes. From muscle tissue of a patient with polymyositis, we isolated 64 T cells that expressed an expanded Vβ 1 chain. In 23 of these cells, we identified the corresponding α-chain. Twenty of these 23 α-chains were identical, suggesting antigen-driven selection. After functional reconstitution of the αβ-pairs, their antigen-recognition properties could be studied.

The lesional and peripheral TCR repertoires were analyzed by pyrosequencing.; RESULTS: We found that a TCR Vbeta 1 (+) T-cell population that was strikingly expanded in active brain lesions at clinical onset comprises several subclones expressing distinct yet closely related Valpha 7. 2 (+) alpha chains, including a canonical Valpha 7. 2 -Jalpha 33 chain of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. Three other alpha chains bear striking similarities in their antigen-recognizing, hypervariable complementarity determining region 3.

40|$|Objective: Spinal tuberculosis-associated {{symptoms}} {{are not so}} unique as to immediately indicate the proper diagnosis in most cases. Distinguishing spinal tuberculosis (Pott’s disease) from pyogenic spondylitis is often difficult, and lesions metastatic from systemic malignancy are the other major entity from which spinal tuberculosis must be distinguished. Clinical Presentation: A 27 -year-old male patient presented {{with a history of}} back pain after a minor trauma 1 month ago. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine showed multiple osteolytic bone lesions at the bodies of T 9, T 10 and T 11 vertebrae and the spinous processes of T 12 and L 1. Other noncontiguous osteolytic lesions were noted at S 2 body and right sacro-iliac joint. Intervention: To confirm the pathologic diagnosis, the patient underwent an open biopsy for the T 12 and L 1 spinous process lesions and a percutaneous transpedicular biopsy on T 9, T 10, <b>T</b> 11 lesions. <b>Frozen</b> biopsy was reported as compatible with chronic granulomatous caseating necrosis without malignant cells. The final diagnosis was an atypical presentation of multiple spinal tuberculosis. The patient received an appropriate enteral anti-tuberculosis therapy and recovered without any complications. Follow-up MRI taken after a year of medical treatment revealed marked resolution of the lesions. Conclusion: Current research indicates the incidence of multi-level noncontiguous, remote vertebral tuberculosis is 1. 1 % to 16 %.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{discriminate}} between chronic inflammation and acute {{activation of the}} plaque immune response in culprit lesions of patients with acute coronary syndromes. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Tertiary referral centre. SUBJECTS: 71 patients having coronary atherectomy were classified according to their ischaemic syndrome: stable angina (n = 23); stabilised unstable angina (n = 18); refractory unstable angina (n = 11); {{and acute myocardial infarction}} (n = 19). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Immunohistochemical measurement of interleukin 2 receptor (IL- 2 R) (CD 25) positive cells expressed {{as a percentage of the}} total amount of (CD 3 positive) <b>T</b> lymphocytes in <b>frozen</b> sections of atherectomy specimens. RESULTS: The number of lesions containing IL- 2 R (CD 25) positive T cells increased with severity of the ischaemic coronary syndrome (stable angina, 52 %; stabilised unstable angina, 77. 8 %; refractory unstable angina, 90. 9 %; acute myocardial infarction, 89. 4 %). The percentage of activated T cells (CD 25 /CD 3 ratios x 100) increased in lesions associated with refractory unstable angina (7. 8 %) and acute myocardial infarction (18. 5 %), compared with those in lesions associated with either chronic stable angina (2. 2 %) or stabilised unstable angina (3. 3 %). CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the percentage of IL- 2 R positive T lymphocytes in culprit lesions of patients with acute coronary syndromes indicates recent activation and amplification of the immune response within plaques. This may result in a burst of inflammatory products with tissue degrading and vasoactive properties and, hence, could initiate or accelerate the onset of an acute coronary even...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFreezing of fox {{carcasses}} {{to minimize}} professional hazard of infection with Echinococcus multilocularis is recommended in endemic areas, but this could influence {{the detection of}} Trichinella larvae in the same host species. A method based on artificial digestion of frozen fox muscle, combined with larva isolation by a sequential sieving method (SSM), was validated using naturally infected foxes from Latvia. The validated SSM was used to detect dead Trichinella muscle larvae (ML) in frozen muscle samples of 369 red foxes from the Netherlands, of which one fox was positive (0. 067 larvae per gram). This result was compared with historical Trichinella findings in Dutch red foxes. Molecular analysis using 5 S PCR showed that both T. britovi and T. nativa {{were present in the}} Latvian foxes, without mixed infections. Of 96 non-frozen T. britovi ML, 94 % was successfully sequenced, whereas this was the case for only 8. 3 % of 72 <b>frozen</b> <b>T.</b> britovi ML. The single Trichinella sp. larva that was recovered from the positive Dutch fox did not yield PCR product, probably due to severe freeze-damage. In conclusion, the SSM presented in this study is a fast and effective method to detect dead Trichinella larvae in frozen meat. We showed that the Trichinella prevalence in Dutch red fox was 0. 27 % (95 % CI 0. 065 - 1. 5 %), in contrast to 3. 9 % in the same study area fifteen years ago.

RESULTS [...] Both monoclonal antibodies gave comparable results on frozen tissue sections and formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded samples from cases with Hodgkin's disease and infectious mononucleosis. In all cases S 12 stained more cells than CS 1 - 4. For EBV associated B and <b>T</b> non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, <b>frozen</b> tissue sections yielded better LMP- 1 staining results than formalin fixed material. Again, {{in all these}} cases S 12 stained more cells and gave stronger results than CS 1 - 4. For EBV negative tissues, both monoclonal antibodies showed cross-reactivity with melanocytic-like cells in the basal cell layer of the skin, synaptophysin-like staining in layers three and four of the cortex of the brain, and myelin-like staining in peripheral nerves and peripheral ganglion cells. Staining with S 12 was always much stronger. Moreover, in contrast to CS 1 - 4, S 12 stained pancreatic islands in formalin fixed material but not in frozen tissue sections and sporadically stained solitary epithelial cells in the large bowel especially in formalin fixed tissue sections. CS 1 - 4 also cross-reacted with myoepithelial cells around hair follicles and other adnexa of the skin. CONCLUSION [...] The results indicate that for optimal detection of LMP- 1, S 12 yields better results than CS 1 - 4 and that tissue processing is very important especially when B and T non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are examined...|$|R
40|$|Because B cells express receptors for C 1 q, we have {{investigated}} the role of C 1 q in the stimulation of B cells. When B {{cells were cultured in}} the presence of C 1 q that had been <b>frozen,</b> <b>T</b> cells, and suboptimal concentrations of PWM, there was a dose-dependent enhancement of IgM, IgG, and IgA by the B cells. No significant enhancement of Ig production by B cells was seen in the absence of T cells or PWM. The contribution of T cells or PWM could be replaced by supernatants of PMA and Con A-activated PBMC (T cell growth factor). C 1 q that had been frozen, in contrast with freshly isolated C 1 q, was at least 3 times more active in enhancement of the production of Ig by B cells in culture in the presence of suboptimal concentrations of T cell growth factor. The capability of C 1 q to stimulate B cells could be ascribed to aggregates of C 1 q. Monomeric C 1 q was only marginally active to stimulate B cell Ig production, whereas dimeric and tetrameric C 1 q were able to enhance Ig production by B cells in relation to their size. Furthermore, aggregation of C 1 q on soluble aggregates of rabbit IgM also increased its potential to enhance B cell Ig production. The interaction of C 1 q with the B cells occurs via the collagenous tail of C 1 q, as suggested by inhibition experiments with purified collagenous tails and globular heads of C 1 q. These results indicate that triggering of C 1 qR on B cells positively regulates Ig production in vitr...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (1) {{one of us}} described a practical method for preserving in ~itro the pathogenicity of certain spirochetes and filtrable viruses by maintaining these organisms in the frozen state at a temperature approximating- 78 °C. It was shown that the virulence of the spirochetes of syphilis and of yaws was not appreciably altered after having been maintained at this temperature for one year, and that the viruses of human influenza (PR 8 strain), yellow fever, and spontaneous encephalomyelitis of mice were infective for mice in virtually as high dilutions after having been frozen at- 78 °C. for 6 months as they were before freezing. It has now been over 3 years since these studies were begun, and we wish to record the results of virulence tests made on several types of spirochetes and filtrable viruses which have been maintained in the frozen state during this period. The technique employed for freezing and maintaining infective material at- 78 °C. was briefly as follows: To a 12 gallon insulated container partly filled with 95 per cent alcohol, solid carbon dioxide was added about twice weekly {{in order to maintain}} a temperature of approximately- 78 °C.

40|$|Study hypothesis: Myometrial explants {{represent}} a superior model compared with cell culture {{models for the}} study of human myometrial progesterone (P 4) signalling in parturition. Study finding: Gene expression analysis showed myometrial explants closely resemble the in vivo condition and the anti-inflammatory action of P 4 is not lost with labour onset. What is known already: Circulating P 4 levels decline before the onset of parturition in most animals, but not in humans. This has led to the suggestion that there is a functional withdrawal of P 4 action at the myometrial level prior to labour onset. However, to date, no evidence of a loss of P 4 function has been provided, with studies hampered by a lack of a physiologically relevant model. Study design, samples/materials, methods: Myometrial biopsies obtained at Caesarean section were dissected into explants after a portion was immediately snap <b>frozen</b> (<b>t</b> = 0). Microarray analysis was used to compare gene expression of t = 0 with paired (i) explants, (ii) passage 4 myometrial cell cultures or (iii) the hTERT myometrial cell line. Western blotting and chemokine/cytokine assays were used to study P 4 signalling in myometrial explants. Main results and the role of chance: Gene expression comparison of t = 0 to the three models demonstrated that explants more closely resemble the in vivo status. At the protein level, explants maintain both P 4 receptor (PR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) levels versus t = 0 whereas cells only maintain GR levels. Additionally, treatment with 1 μM P 4 led to a reduction in interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) β-driven cyclooxygenase- 2 in explants but not in cells. P 4 signalling in explants was PR-mediated and associated with a repression of p 65 and c-Jun phosphorylation. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory action of P 4 was maintained after labour onset. Limitations/reasons for caution: There is evidence of basal inflammation in the myometrial explant model. Wider implications of the findings: Myometrial explants constitute a novel model to study P 4 signalling in the myometrium and can be used to further elucidate the mechanisms of P 4 action in human labour.

40|$|Abstract: Laser microdissection (LMD) is a {{technique}} that allows the recovery of selected cells and tissues from minute amounts of parenchyma. The dissected cells {{can be used for}} a variety of investigations, such as transcriptomic or proteomic studies, DNA assessment or chromosomal analysis. An especially challenging application of LMD is transcriptome analysis, which, due to the lability of RNA, can be particularly prominent when cells are dissected from tissues that are rich of RNases, such as the pancreas. A microdissection protocol that enables fast identification and collection of target cells is essential in this setting in order to shorten the tissue handling time and, consequently, to ensure RNA preservation. Here we describe a protocol for acquiring human pancreatic beta cells from surgical specimens to be used for transcriptomic studies. Small pieces of pancreas of about 0. 5 - 1 cm(3) were cut from the healthy appearing margins of resected pancreas specimens, embedded in Tissue-Tek O. C. <b>T.</b> Compound, immediately <b>frozen</b> in chilled 2 -Methylbutane, and stored at - 80 °C until sectioning. Forty serial sections of 10 mum thickness were cut on a cryostat under a - 20 °C setting, transferred individually to glass slides, dried inside the cryostat for 1 - 2 min, and stored at - 80 °C. Immediately before the laser microdissection procedure, sections were fixed in ice cold, freshly prepared 70 % ethanol for 30 sec, washed by 5 - 6 dips in ice cold DEPC-treated water, and dehydrated by two one-minute incubations in ice cold 100 % ethanol followed by xylene (which is used for tissue dehydration) for 4 min; tissue sections were then air-dried afterwards for 3 - 5 min. Importantly, all steps, except the incubation in xylene, were performed using ice-cold reagents - a modification over a previously described protocol. utilization of ice cold reagents resulted in a pronounced increase of the intrinsic autofluorescence of beta cells, and facilitated their recognition. For microdissection, four sections were dehydrated each time: two were placed into a foil-wrapped 50 ml tube, to protect the tissue from moisture and bleaching; the remaining two were immediately microdissected. This procedure was performed using a PALM MicroBeam instrument (Zeiss) employing the Auto Laser Pressure Catapulting (AutoLPC) mode. The completion of beta cell/islet dissection from four cryosections required no longer than 40 - 60 min. Cells were collected into one AdhesiveCap and lysed with 10 mul lysis buffer. Each single RNA specimen for transcriptomic analysis was obtained by combining 10 cell microdissected samples, followed by RNA extraction using the Pico Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Arcturus). This protocol improves the intrinsic autofluorescence of human beta cells, thus facilitating their rapid and accurate recognition and collection. Further improvement of this procedure could enable the dissection of phenotypically different beta cells, with possible implications for better understanding the changes associated with type 2 diabetes...|$|R

Harvest {{tissue and}} rinse in PBS or saline. - Immerse tissue in 4 % paraformaldehyde/ 0. 1 M sodium {{phosphate}} buffer pH 7. 4 (recipe follows) at 4 °C for 1 - 3 hrs. Try to avoid overnight fixation if possible as this causes problems with tissue adherence on slides during the hybridization procedure. - Immerse tissue in sterile 15 % sucrose/ 1 xPBS (recipe follows) 3 hrs. to overnight at 4 °C. - Embed tissue in O. C. T. (Baxter No. M 7148 - 4), M 1 (Lipshaw) {{or any other}} convenient embedding matrix for frozen sectioning in plastic embedding molds (. Tissue should be oriented in the block appropriately for sectioning (cross-section, longitudinal etc.). Note the tissue number on the block directly for reference. - Freeze tissue block in liquid nitrogen. Place the bottom third (aproximately) of the block into the liquid nitrogen, allow to freeze until all but {{the center of the}} O. C. <b>T.</b> is <b>frozen,</b> and allow freezing to conclude on dry ice. - Store tissue blocks at - 70 °C in a sealed container or wrapped in foil and ship on dry ice. It is also possible to use fresh frozen tissue for in situ hybridization if the paraformaldehyde/sucrose method is not feasible. Tissues should be rinsed in saline or PBS and frozen in O. C. T. blocks in liquid nitrogen as outlined above. Although not optimal, it is also possible to use snap frozen material tissue without an embedding matrix. The fixation, sucrose, and O. C. T. steps are used primarily to improve the tissue morphology. It is expected that the fixation times outlined above will not result in complete fixation of large pieces of tissue. However, the additional fixation step {{at the beginning of the}} in situ hybridization procedure should ensure adequate fixation of such tissues prior to hybridization. This protocol has been used successfully on large (up to 1 cubic cm) and small (1 cubic mm) tissue samples. 4 **% Paraformaldehyde** - Mix in a two liter flask: - 200 ml 0. 5 M NaPO 4, pH 7. 4 - 800 ml depcH 20 - Heat to 70 °C with stirring on hot plate in fume hood - Add 40 g Paraformaldehyde (EM grade, Polysciences, Cat No. 0380) - Once the solution has cleared (it should take 5 minutes or less), filter with a side-arm flask, Buchner funnel and Whatman No. 2 filter paper. - Immediately pour the solution into a one liter bottle which has been packed in ice. This cools the solution quickly and prevents breakdown of the paraformaldehyde. Store at 4 °C for up to two weeks. ** 15 % Sucrose in PBS:** - 500 ml sterile PBS - 75 g "RNase free" sucrose - Mix above and filter sterilize with a disposable Nalgene filtration unit type S(0. 45 micron). Store at 4 °C. **USE OF FISHERBRAND SUPERFROST/PLUS MICROSCOPE SLIDES FOR IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION** We use Fisherbrand SuperFrost/Plus positively-charged microscope slides (Cat. No. 12 - 550 - 15) for all of our frozen tissue sectioning and have very good tissue retention on slides after an in situ hybridization experiment. SuperFrost/Plus slides require no preparation time prior to cryosectioning and are competitive in terms of labor cost and reagent expenses. **SECTIONING OF FROZEN TISSUES FOR IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION** 1. Frozen tissues prepared as described can be wrapped and stored for many years prior to sectioning, without loss of the mRNA signal. The biggest problem with stored tissue blocks is that they tend to dessicate if not properly wrapped and the O. C. T. (Optimal Cutting Temperature compound) can be difficult to cut. - Blocks should be removed from the - 70 °C freezer and allowed to equilabrate with the cryostat chamber temperature. Tissues can be cut at any convenient temperature (- 15 to - 35 °C) as needed. Most tissues cut well at - 15 °C (brain, kidney, liver, vessels, muscle, etc.) however fatty or more difficult tissues (adipose tissue, skin, lung) require temperatures as low as - 35 °C or less to obtain good sections. Care should be taken not to touch the face of the slides but handle by the edges only. Frozen sections 5 - 7 µm (thinner is OK but thicker, over 10 µm, may present problems for visualizing mRNA in situ) should be cut, thaw-mounted onto room-temperature slides, and immediately refrozen by placing slides with sections into a slide box (VWR micro slide box # 48444 - 003) with a single dessicant capsule (Humi-Cap see below). When the box is full, place the top on the box and store at - 70 °C. Sections cut and stored with dessicant are stable for in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry for most antigens for over 5 years...|$|R
