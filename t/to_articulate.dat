5|$|Hamlet's soliloquies {{have also}} {{captured}} the attention of scholars. Hamlet interrupts himself, vocalising either disgust or agreement with himself, and embellishing his own words.

5|$|Scottish nineteenth-century Reformed theologian William Cunningham {{also sought}} <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> a distinctively Reformed {{theology}} of baptism {{in the modern}} world.

5|$|The {{cognitive}} ability {{of children with}} AS often allows them <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> social norms in a laboratory context, where {{they may be able}} to show a theoretical understanding of other people's emotions; however, they typically have difficulty acting on this knowledge in fluid, real-life situations. People with AS may analyze and distill their observations of social interaction into rigid behavioral guidelines, and apply these rules in awkward ways, such as forced eye contact, resulting in a demeanor that appears rigid or socially naive. Childhood desire for companionship can become numbed through a history of failed social encounters.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} between civilization and barbarism mirrors Latin America's {{difficulties in the}} post-Independence era. Literary critic Sorensen Goodrich argues that although Sarmiento {{was not the first}} <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> this dichotomy, he forged it into a powerful and prominent theme that would impact Latin American literature. He explores the issue of civilization versus the cruder aspects of a caudillo culture of brutality and absolute power. Facundo set forth an oppositional message that promoted a more beneficial alternative for society at large. Although Sarmiento advocated various changes, such as honest officials who understood enlightenment ideas of European and Classical origin, for him education was the key.|$|E

40|$|The ICP {{algorithm}} {{has been}} extensively used in computer vision for registration and tracking purposes. The original formulation of this method is restricted {{to the use of}} non-articulated models. A straightforward generalisation <b>to</b> <b>articulated</b> structures is achievable through the joint minimisation of all the structure pose parameters, for example using Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) optimisation. However, in this approach the aligning transformation cannot be estimated in closed form, like in the original ICP, and the approach heavily suffers from local minima. To overcome this limitation, some authors have extended the straightforward generalisation at the cost of giving up some of the properties of ICP. In this paper, we present a generalisation of ICP <b>to</b> <b>articulated</b> structures, which preserves all the properties of the original algorithm. The key idea is <b>to</b> divide the <b>articulated</b> body into parts, which can be aligned rigidly {{in the way of the}} original ICP, with additional constraints <b>to</b> keep the <b>articulated</b> structure intact. Experiments show that our method reduces the residual registration error by a factor of ≈ 2. ...|$|R

Sonnet 86 is notable within the Rival Poet subsection of sonnets because it allegedly provides important clues as to the historical identity of this Rival Poet. The sonnet is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, containing 14 lines of iambic pentameter and ending in a rhymed couplet.|$|E
5|$|In 354BC, Demosthenes {{delivered}} his first political oration, On the Navy, {{in which he}} espoused moderation and proposed the reform of the symmoriai (boards) {{as a source of}} funding for the Athenian fleet. In 352BC, he delivered For the Megalopolitans and, in 351BC, On the Liberty of the Rhodians. In both speeches he opposed Eubulus, the most powerful Athenian statesman of the period 355 to 342BC. The latter was no pacifist but came to eschew a policy of aggressive interventionism {{in the internal affairs of}} the other Greek cities. Contrary to Eubulus's policy, Demosthenes called for an alliance with Megalopolis against Sparta or Thebes, and for supporting the democratic faction of the Rhodians in their internal strife. His arguments revealed his desire <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> Athens's needs and interests through a more activist foreign policy, wherever opportunity might provide.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Relief partisans opened many {{lines of}} attack against Desha. They said his refusal <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> a {{specific}} campaign platform {{showed that he}} was trying to be all things to all people. They assailed his military record, claiming he had only volunteered for service in the War of 1812 after being promised command of a division, that he balked at fighting and discouraged General Harrison's pursuit of the British and Indians, and that he billed excessive expenses to the government after his service. Desha's legislative career was also subject to scrutiny and attack. Anti-Relief partisans claimed that he had espoused certain positions for the sole purpose of pitting the state's agrarian interests against its aristocracy. They charged that he had secretly favored the Compensation Act of 1816 and had worked to pass it, despite his vote against it. In contrast to his rhetoric in favor of a strong, well-equipped army and navy, opponents claimed he had actually voted against increasing the military's budget. As further evidence of his lack of trustworthiness, they pointed to his vote for William H. Crawford while serving as a presidential elector in 1816, even though Kentuckians were nearly unanimous in their support of James Monroe.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a tuned eigenspace technique {{so as to}} classify human motion. The method presented here overcomes those problems related <b>to</b> <b>articulated</b> motion and dress texture effects by learning various human motions {{in terms of their}} sequential postures in an eigenspace. In order to cope with the variability inherent <b>to</b> <b>articulated</b> motion, we propose a method to tune the set of sequential eigenspaces. Once the learnt tuned eigenspaces are at hand, the recognition task then becomes a nearest-neighbor search over the eigenspaces. We show how our tuned eigenspace method can be used for purposes of real-world and synthetic pose recognition. We also discuss and overcome the problem related to clothing texture that occurs in real-world data, and propose a background subtraction method to employ the method in out-door environment. We provide results on synthetic imagery for a number of human poses and illustrate the utility of the method for the purposes of human motion recognition. ...|$|R
