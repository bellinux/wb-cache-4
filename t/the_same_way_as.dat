5|$|Active collectors: these collect {{water in}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> a dehumidifier; {{although}} the designs work well, they require an energy source, making them uneconomical except in special circumstances.

50|$|Developmental {{psychology}} employs many of {{the research}} methods used {{in other areas of}} psychology. However, infants and children cannot be tested in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>ways</b> <b>as</b> adults, so different methods are often used to study their development.|$|R

5|$|Nanosilver particles, between 10 and 100nanometres in size, {{are used}} in many applications.
