50|$|Relations {{between the}} UK and Nepal have {{historically}} been friendly {{and there have been}} close links between the Royal Families, although relations deteriorated when the King took power in 2005. A treaty of friendship was signed in 1923, which superseded the Sugauli Treaty signed in 1816. The UK is highly regarded in Nepal. This is through historical <b>ties,</b> <b>development</b> <b>assistance</b> and long term support in the struggle for democratic peace in Nepal. Also of note is that through the recruitment of Gurkha soldiers by the British Army since the 19th century, Nepal has had links with the United Kingdom.

40|$|How {{should a}} {{policy-maker}} prioritize interventions {{to improve the}} public infrastructure with which firms operate and how large are the benefits from doing so likely to be? To address these questions we use survey data on the obstacles arising from poor quality public inputs that managers face in running their firms. Our conceptual framework centres on the public input character of physical infrastructure and institutions, and uses an O-ring production function to model the impact of poor quality infrastructure on output. Using survey data from over 72, 000 firms in 95 countries, we verify {{the consistency of the}} within- and cross-country variation in reported constraints with predictions of the model. We use the framework to construct estimates of the impact on output and productivity of improvements in the quality of public inputs and how these differ between rich and poor countries. We show how a policy-maker can use the country-level data and the benchmarks estimated from the cross-country data to prioritize public infrastructure investment in their country. Our results indicate that priorities vary widely among countries and suggest a degree of caution about donor policies <b>tying</b> <b>development</b> <b>assistance</b> to generic improvements in the business environment. The results also suggest that the benefits arising directly from such improvements are likely to be modest relative to the scale of impact implied by aggregate-level studies of the role of institutions in economic development. constraints on growth; finance; infrastructure; institutions; O-ring production function; public infrastructure; public inputs; subjective data...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{aimed to}} {{quantify}} <b>development</b> <b>assistance</b> for health to countries {{of central and}} eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CEE-CIS). METHODS: We used the International Development Statistics database of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the database on <b>development</b> <b>assistance</b> for health compiled for the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health to quantify health <b>development</b> <b>assistance</b> to the region, compared to global and overall <b>development</b> <b>assistance.</b> We based our analysis on standard health indicators, including child mortality, life expectancy at birth and health expenditures. FINDINGS: Although total <b>development</b> <b>assistance</b> per capita to CEE-CIS was higher than that for most other regions of the world, <b>development</b> <b>assistance</b> for health was very low compared to other countries with similar levels of child mortality, life expectancy at birth and national expenditures on health. CONCLUSION: The allocation of <b>development</b> <b>assistance</b> for health on a global scale seems to be related far more to child mortality rather than adult mortality. Countries of CEE-CIS have a high burden of adult morbidity and mortality from non-communicable diseases, which does not appear to attract proportionate <b>development</b> <b>assistance.</b> Levels of <b>development</b> <b>assistance</b> for health should be determined in consideration of the region's particular burden of disease...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is outline an {{alternative}} theory of <b>development</b> <b>assistance</b> by analyzing the old strategies for technical cooperation, capacity-building and, in broader terms, <b>development</b> <b>assistance</b> in a way that will point to new strategies. The perspective is the very old idea that the best form of assistance is to help people help themselves. The problem is how can the helpers supply help that actually furthers rather than overrides or undercuts the goal of the doers helping themselves? This problem of supplying help to self-help, “assisted self-reliance” or assisted autonomy, is the fundamental conundrum of <b>development</b> <b>assistance.</b> The forms of help that override or undercut people's capacity to help themselves will be called “unhelpful help. ” These two overriding and undercutting forms of unhelpful help are analyzed and strategies for autonomy-respecting help are presented.
