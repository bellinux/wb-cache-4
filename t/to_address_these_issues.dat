5|$|A {{development}} {{in recent years}} that seeks <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> has been termed evidence-based medicine. As its name suggests, this approach strives to rigorously study the effects of different interventions instead of relying on logic or tradition. Jeffrey Arnold argues that its application worldwide could lead to the boon of sharing best practices between emergency medicine practitioners in various countries, thus advancing the current standard of emergency care.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>address</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues,</b> the 1981 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) {{eliminated}} Puerto Rico {{from the}} national Food Stamp program and created the Nutrition Assistance Program for Puerto Rico as a block grant to provide more administrative flexibility to the Commonwealth while reducing Federal expenditures. After a year of studies and design, it commenced operations on July 1, 1982 with an annual appropriation of $825 million.|$|E

In response to these complaints, Svensson noted that a patch was being discussed with the development team <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> in a future update. An updated version was released on January 28, 2013 under the name, Street Fighter X Mega Man V2. The update boasts an improved user interface, better controller compatibility, bug fixes, a password save system reminiscent of the original Mega Man games on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and an additional boss character.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{or groups}} could {{petition}} at the Castellania through a supplicha; common cases were from practitioners needing {{a license to}} perform their occupation and the poor requesting social benefits. For such purposes and other, the Castellania and related tribunals employed {{the largest number of}} clerks. At one point, the working environment of the clerks had no standard working hours and their outcome received country-wide criticism; this resulted in counter petitions, with the clients requesting efficient service in less waiting time and the clerks requesting increase in wages. By 1780 a bando was introduced <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues.</b>|$|E

25|$|Union busting in the United States dates {{at least}} to the 19th century, when a rapid {{expansion}} in factories and manufacturing capabilities caused a migration of workers from agricultural work to the mining, manufacturing and transportation industries.

Because employers and governments did little <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues,</b> labor movements in the industrialized world were formed to seek better wages, hours, and working conditions. The clashes between labor and management were often adversarial and were deeply affected by wars, economic conditions, government policies, and court proceedings.|$|E
