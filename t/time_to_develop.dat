5|$|Although {{sales for}} Mega Man were unimpressive, Capcom allowed the Rockman team {{to create a}} sequel. They worked {{concurrently}} on other Capcom projects, using their free <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> the game. Unused content from the previous title was integrated into Mega Man 2. Takashi Tateishi composed the soundtrack, with Yoshihiro Sakaguchi serving as a sound programmer.|$|E
5|$|Foundational {{elements}} for a student's learning {{were having a}} concept of (principally diatonic) scales as music and a basis for harmony. One of the teaching tools often used by Tristano, including for scales, was the metronome. The student set the metronome at or near its slowest setting initially, and gradually increased its speed, allowing a sense of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop,</b> along with confidence in placing each note.|$|E
5|$|The Defence Forces set strict {{requirements}} for the vehicles to be produced. There was not enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> a new model. Although outdated, {{the best of the}} available options was the Sisu S-21. Yhteissisu and SAT agreed to transfer Sisu S-21 lorry production to Yhteissisu. The Yhteissisu-produced models were named S-22.|$|E

5|$|The {{track of}} Tropical Storm Gert was {{slightly}} {{more to the}} north than the National Hurricane Center's initial predictions, giving the storm more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop.</b> As a result, the NHC predicted that Gert could intensify further, but this did not occur. The primary emphasis of the forecasts was on the impact the rainfall from Gert could cause, particularly on this area of Mexico, which had been hit previously in the season by other hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Two {{external}} factors had their impacts on Verdi's compositions of this period. One {{is that with}} increasing reputation and financial security he no longer needed to commit himself to the productive treadmill, had more freedom to choose his own subjects, and had more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> them according to his own ideas. In the years 1849 to 1859 he wrote eight new operas, compared with fourteen in the previous ten years.|$|E
5|$|Coprinellus micaceus has a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, {{and has been}} collected in northern Africa, South Africa, Europe (including Turkey), North America (as far north as Alaska), the Hawaiian islands, South America, India, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. Phylogenetic analysis of rDNA sequences from specimens collected in southeastern Asia and Hawaii show that the Hawaiian species form a distinct clade with little genetic diversity compared to Asian populations; {{this suggests that the}} Hawaiian populations have been introduced relatively recently and have not had much <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> genetic variation. One study suggests that in South Africa, where C.micaceus is rare, it has been frequently confused with the similar-appearing C.truncorum, a more common species in that region. A similar inference has been raised about North American species.|$|E

5|$|Development of MediEvil: Resurrection {{began in}} 2003 at SCE Cambridge Studio. The senior {{management}} team of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe wanted a launch game for the PlayStation Portable console and ordered the studio to develop the game {{in time for the}} console's release. Due to the short notice, the studio was given only a year to develop a game, thus it was decided that a remake of the original MediEvil would be suitable as developing an original title would take more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop.</b>|$|E
5|$|Reamon, who {{had helped}} guide Brooks from Newport News to the University of Virginia, helped Michael with his SATs and helped {{him and his family}} choose between Syracuse University and Virginia Tech. Reamon favored Virginia Tech, where he felt better {{guidance}} was available under Frank Beamer, who promised to redshirt him and provide the freshman needed <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop.</b> Reamon sold Michael on the school's proximity to family and friends, and Vick chose to attend Virginia Tech. As he left the Newport News public housing projects in 1998 with a college football scholarship in hand, Vick was seen in the Newport News community as a success story.|$|E
5|$|Ridge Racer Revolution is an arcade racing game {{developed}} {{and published by}} Namco for the PlayStation in 1995. It is the PlayStation sequel of Ridge Racer (the arcade sequel is Ridge Racer 2). Like the original Ridge Racer, the player races computer-controlled cars {{with the objective of}} winning a series of races, and supports Namco's NeGcon controller. Ridge Racer Revolution adds two hidden cars, and two-player support via the PlayStation Link cable, and took roughly the same <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> as the first. The intention was to increase the depth and add features.|$|E

5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} take <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop,</b> {{and as many}} as half of cases are asymptomatic at the initial presentation. The more severe the injury, the more quickly symptoms become apparent. In severe cases, symptoms may occur as quickly as three or fourhours after the trauma. Hypoxemia (low oxygen concentration in the arterial blood) typically becomes progressively worse over 24–48hours after injury. In general, pulmonary contusion tends to worsen slowly over a few days, but it may also cause rapid deterioration or death if untreated.|$|E
5|$|The car was {{initially}} conceived in 1965 for a 1.5-litre (92-cubic inch) Coventry Climax engine, but never raced in this form. For the 1966 Formula One season the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) doubled the limit on engine capacity to 3litres (183cuin). Australian company Repco {{developed a new}} V8 engine for Brabham's use in 1966, but a disagreement between Brabham and Tauranac over the latter's role in the racing team left no <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> a new car to handle it. Instead, the existing BT19 chassis was modified for the job.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} with Aya Brea, an NYPD rookie, {{attending}} an opera at Carnegie Hall with {{a blind date}} in New York City on Christmas Eve 1997. During the opera, everyone in the building spontaneously combusts, except for Aya, and an actress on stage named Melissa Pearce. Aya confronts Melissa onstage, and Melissa says that Aya’s mitochondria need more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop.</b> She flees backstage, with Aya giving chase. Backstage, Melissa then mutates into a beast and flees into the sewers, declaring that her name is now Eve.|$|E

5|$|After {{the initial}} {{transfer}} of forces in March 1901, further progress was slow as administrative and legislative instruments took <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop.</b> Indeed, {{it was not}} until 1 March 1904 that the Defence Act 1903 was proclaimed, providing the Commonwealth Military Forces a statutory framework within which they could operate. Amidst a background of political manoeuvring and personal agendas, the military forces were eventually reorganised into a more or less unified command structure. As a part of this, state-based mounted units were reformed into light horse regiments, supplemented by the transfer of men from a number of superfluous infantry units, while the remaining infantry were organised into battalions of the Australian Infantry Regiment and engineers and artillery were organised into field companies and garrison artillery batteries. Due to the provisions of the Defence Act which did not provide {{for the establishment of a}} regular infantry force, the notion that the Commonwealth Military Forces would be largely based on a part-time militia was set out in legislation.|$|E
5|$|Discussions between ESRO and Norwegian {{authorities}} continued, with ESRO {{pressing for}} a quick decision, while Norway was stalling the negotiations. This was carried out to allow <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> solid counter-policy against the Soviet Union {{as well as to}} gain support for the installation to be located at Kongsfjorden outside Ny-Ålesund. On the other hand, ESRO threatened to instead build the installation in northern Sweden and northern Canada and abandon the Svalbard plans. An agreement was reached between ESRO, Norwegian authorities and NTNF was on 14 December 1964. It established both the location and that NTNF would be Norway's party. The agreement allowed the station to be located in Ny-Ålesund in exchange for Norwegian authorities building and operating the facility. While ESRO accepted NTNF as the Norwegian party, they wanted to receive a guarantee from the Norwegian authorities. However, to minimize Soviet criticism, the ministry was not interested in giving direct guarantees and asked that ESRO solely negotiate with NTNF.|$|E
5|$|In France, Sauvignon blanc {{is grown}} in the {{maritime}} climate of Bordeaux (especially in Entre-Deux-Mers, Graves and Pessac-Léognan as a dry wine, and in Sauternes as a sweet wine) {{as well as the}} continental climate of the Loire Valley (as Pouilly Fumé, Sancerre, and Sauvignon de Touraine). The climates of these areas are particularly favorable in slowing the ripening on the vine, allowing the grape more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> a balance between its acidity and sugar levels. This balance is important {{in the development of the}} intensity of the wine's aromas. Winemakers in France pay careful attention to the terroir characteristics of the soil and the different elements that it can impart to the wine. The chalk and Kimmeridgean marl of Sancerre and Pouilly produces wines of richness and complexity while areas with more compact chalk soils produces wines with more finesse and perfume. The gravel soil found near the Loire River and its tributaries impart spicy, floral and mineral flavors while in Bordeaux, the wines have a fruitier personality. Vines planted in flint tend to produce the most vigorous and longest lasting wines.|$|E

5|$|In September 1946, {{prior to}} the {{completion}} of the DH 108s, BOAC requests necessitated a redesign of the DH 106 from its previous 24-seat configuration to a larger 36-seat version. With no <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> the technology necessary for a proposed tailless configuration, Bishop opted for a more conventional 20-degree swept-wing design with unswept tail surfaces, married to an enlarged fuselage accommodating 36 passengers in a four-abreast arrangement with a central aisle. Replacing previously specified Halford H.1 Goblin engines, four new, more powerful Rolls-Royce Avons were to be incorporated in pairs buried in the wing roots; Halford H.2 Ghost engines were eventually applied as an interim solution while the Avons cleared certification. The redesigned aircraft was named the DH 106 Comet in December 1947. Revised first orders from BOAC and British South American Airways totalled 14 aircraft with delivery projected for 1952.|$|E
5|$|Sales were satisfactory, and the {{development}} of sequels began almost immediately after The Witcher release. The team began the design work for The Witcher 2 , and experimented with consoles to develop a new engine for The Witcher 3. Their development was halted when the team began work on , a console version of The Witcher. Although they collaborated with French studio Widescreen Games for the console port, it entered development limbo. Widescreen demanded more manpower, money and <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> the title, complaining that they were not being paid; according to Iwiński, CD Projekt paid them more than their own staff members. The team cancelled the project, suspending its development. Unhappy with the decision, Atari demanded that CD Projekt repay them for funding the console port development and Iwiński agreed that Atari would be the North American publisher of the sequel of The Witcher 2. CD Projekt acquired Metropolis Software in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 NHL Entry Draft {{was held}} in St. Paul, Minnesota, on June 24 and 25. Heading into the draft, the Capitals had only five picks due {{to a variety of}} trades, which was tied for the fewest in {{franchise}} history. Believing that they had prospect depth in their organization and not seeing an available player who could help immediately, Washington traded their first round pick for Troy Brouwer. With just late round selections remaining, the Capitals decided to take players that required <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop.</b> Three of their four picks were in, or set to attend, college. Fourth-round pick Steffen Soberg, the lone player not attending college, played in the GET-ligaen, Norway's highest level of competition. At the 2011 IIHF World U18 Championships, he posted the second-highest save percentage in the tournament and was considered one of Norway's top three players, though no Norwegian goaltender has ever played an NHL game.|$|E
