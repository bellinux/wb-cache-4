The mechanics of joint deformations are analysed {{in relation to the}} yield line theory, and simple models are shown to give a good prediction of the joint stiffnesses and strengths. Complex yield line models are investigated, but are slightly or not superior to the simple models. Recommendations are established covering the design of tension and compression chord joints, as well as chord and web members. The design of a 22 m span triangular truss is outlined...|$|E
40|$|Various {{automotive}} lifts use four cantilevered arms {{to elevate}} and support vehicles on adapter pads positioned on their free ends. These arms, when raised, {{are supposed to}} be restrained against rotation in a horizontal plane. When restrained, the arms provide a robust structural system for resisting horizontal workplace forces that tend to slide vehicles off the pads. The arms maintain the horizontal locations of the adapters by developing bending and axial planar resistance. If, on the other hand, the arms are free to pivot through sloth or poor design, their structural behavior is dramatically transformed. The planar bending resistance of the arms completely disappears and they become direct stress diagonal truss members; the vehicle itself unwittingly becomes the truss ’ <b>tension</b> <b>chord.</b> The appearance of the fixed and pivoting systems is the same; however, the truss action magnifies the horizontal forces acting on the adapter pads increasing the slip probability. Indeed, depending on the orientation of the pivoting swing arms, any finite horizontal force applied to a vehicle may lead to an unbounded tangential “slide-out ” force. This is, of course, a theoretical possibility, not a practical reality...|$|E

The design of offshore structures is controlled by mandatory design codes to ensure structural safety and integrity. The main objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the cracking criteria for offshore structures and develop a rational numerical model in order to predict crack width and spacing of high strength concrete under flexural sustained service loads. [...] An experimental investigation is designed to study the cracking behaviour of high strength concrete plates. Eight two-way reinforced concrete specimens with different thick concrete cover and bar spacing were tested in the structural laboratory at Memorial University of Newfoundland under flexural loading. The tests specimens are divided into three groups. The first two groups are heavily reinforced and designed to fail under punching shear mode. The first group (Series I) is designed to investigate the effect of concrete cover on the crack width and crack spacing. The second group (Series II) is designed to investigate the effect of bar spacing on the crack width and crack spacing. The third group (Series III) is designed to investigate the effect of different modes of failure on the crack width and crack spacing for two-way reinforced concrete slabs. The structural behaviour of the test slabs with regards to deformations, strains, crack patterns, crack width and mode of failure was examined. [...] It has been found that the effect of increasing concrete cover from 30 mm to 60 mm of (Series I) increases the crack spacing by 38 %. The crack spacing of (Series II) was increased by 28 %, when the bar spacing increased from 1 50 to 250 mm. The test results revealed that the relation of the crack width versus steel strain can be represented by a straight line up to a limiting steel strain of 0. 001 to 0. 0015 for most of the test slabs. This strain value corresponds to a reinforcement stress equal to 200 MPa to 250 MPa (0. 50 - 0. 63 fy). [...] The theoretical investigation includes two phases. The first phase is evaluating the suitability of the existing crack width and crack spacing expressions for structures with large concrete covers. The experimental test results of all test slabs confirmed the recommendation of an existing equation. The second phase includes the development of a numerical crack analysis model based on <b>tension</b> <b>chord</b> method. The developed proposed expression to calculate the crack width is based on the modified assumption of the <b>tension</b> <b>chord</b> method. A second model was recommended based on the fracture energy principles to estimate the crack width. The modified assumptions deal with estimating the tensile strength, bond strength and the active tension concrete area. The newly developed expressions provided good results for high strength thick concrete cross sections with large concrete cover...|$|E

A surgical planning system based on patient-specific medical images that allows surgeons to simulate and compare potential repair strategies could greatly improve surgical outcomes. The system must simulate valve closure quickly and handle the complex boundary conditions imposed by the chords that tether the valve leaflets. We have developed a process for generating a triangulated mesh of the valve surface from volumetric image data of the opened valve. The closed position of the mesh is then computed using a mass-spring model of dynamics. In the mass-spring model, triangle sides are treated as linear springs supporting only <b>tension.</b> <b>Chords</b> are also treated as linear springs, and self-collisions are detected and handled inelastically. The equations of motion are solved using implicit numerical integration.

40|$|To heal tissue defects, {{cells have}} to bridge gaps and {{generate}} new extracellular matrix (ECM). Macroporous scaffolds are frequently {{used to support}} the process of defect filling and thus foster tissue regeneration. Such biomaterials contain micro-voids (pores) that the cells fill with their own ECM over time. There is only limited knowledge on how pore geometry influences cell organization and matrix production, {{even though it is}} highly relevant for scaffold design. This study hypothesized that 1) a simple geometric description predicts cellular organization during pore filling at the cell level and that 2) pore closure results in a reorganization of ECM. Scaffolds with a broad distribution of pore sizes (macroporous starPEG-heparin cryogel) were used as a model system and seeded with primary fibroblasts. The strategies of cells to fill pores could be explained by a simple geometrical model considering cells as <b>tensioned</b> <b>chords.</b> The model matched qualitatively as well as quantitatively by means of cell number vs. open cross-sectional area for all pore sizes. The correlation between ECM location and cell position was higher when the pores were not filled with tissue (Pearson’s coefficient r = 0. 4560. 01) and reduced once the pores were closed (r = 0. 2660. 04) indicating a reorganization of the cell/ECM network. Scaffold pore size directed the time required for pore closure and furthermore impacted the organization of the fibronectin matrix. Understanding how cells fill micro-voids will help to design biomaterial scaffolds that support the endogenou...|$|R
40|$|Although Steel Fibre Reinforced Concrete (SFRC) has {{a history}} in academia of over 50 years, its {{adoption}} in practice has mainly been limited to non-critical elements. In order for SFRC to be used on a regular basis, a rational framework of material models identifying the key material parameters must be established. The defining property when considering {{the design of a}} structural member manufactured with SFRC is its post cracking, or residual, tensile strength. The first part of this thesis sets out to experimentally identify the post cracking characteristics of SFRC at the material level. Two methods are adopted: the first being a direct tension test; the second, a prism bending test combined with an inverse analysis. In this section, a rational simple yet effective inverse analysis procedure is derived. The model is versatile in that it is independent of specimen geometry, testing span and method of testing. The model is validated against 23 different SFRC mixes obtained over the course of this study and from data presented in the literature; it is shown to correlate well with the test data. The second part of this thesis examines the interrelationship of steel fibres and conventional steel reinforcement in carrying tension. Four series of SFRC tension ties of varying fibre dosages and longitudinal reinforcing ratios were manufactured and tested. A model founded upon the <b>Tension</b> <b>Chord</b> Model was deployed to consider the post cracking residual tensile strength of the fibres provided at the crack. The model was shown to accurately predict the behaviour of the tested specimens and, also, those found in the literature. The final part of this dissertation investigates the shear capacity of ten large scale SFRC beams containing varying degrees of shear ligature reinforcement and fibre quantities. The results indicate that as the fibre dosage increased, the cracks became visibly more dispersed and finer, and were able to engage more stirrups. A set of numerical analyses were conducted using the commercially available software ATENA. It was found that if a suitable constitutive law in tension was used, the model could accurately predict the behaviour of the beams...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{relatively}} low tensile strength of concrete, cracks are inevitable in reinforced concrete structures. Therefore, studying the cracking behaviour of reinforced concrete elements and controlling the width of cracks are necessary objectives both in research and in design. The introduction of higher strength reinforcing steel has exacerbated the problem of crack control. Using higher strength steel, means less steel is required for a given structure to satisfy the strength requirements. The stiffness after cracking is reduced and wider crack widths will occur under normal service loads. Unserviceable cracking may encourage corrosion in the reinforcement and surface deterioration, and may lead to long term problems with durability. Indeed excessive cracking results in a huge annual cost to the construction industry {{because it is the}} most common cause of damage in concrete structures. In this study cracking caused by both shrinkage and external loads in reinforced concrete members is examined experimentally and analytically. The mechanisms associated with cracking and the factors affecting the time-varying width and spacing of both direct tension cracks due to restrained shrinkage deformation and flexural cracks due to the combined effects of constant sustained service loads and shrinkage are examined. Laboratory tests on eight fully restrained slab specimens were conducted for up to 150 days to measure the effects of drying shrinkage on the time-dependent development of direct tension cracks due to restrained deformation. The effect of varying the quantity, diameter, and spacing of reinforcing steel bars was studied. In addition, an analytical model previously developed without experimental verification by Gilbert (1992) to study shrinkage cracking was modified and recalibrated. A second series of tests on twenty four prismatic, singly reinforced concrete beams and slabs subjected to monotonically increasing loads or to constant sustained service loads for up to 400 days, were also conducted. The effects of steel area, steel stress, bar diameter, bar spacing, concrete cover and shrinkage were measured and quantified. An analytical model is presented to simulate instantaneous and time-dependent flexural cracking. The <b>tension</b> <b>chord</b> model (Marti et al, 1998) is modified and used in the proposed model to simulate the tension zone of a flexural member and the time-dependent effects of creep and shrinkage are included.

40|$|Abstract We {{attempted}} to predict perceived musical <b>tension</b> in longer <b>chord</b> sequences by hierarchic and sequential models based on Lerdahl and Jackendo€'s and Lerdahl's cognitive theories and on Parncutt's sensorypsychoacoustical theory. Musicians and nonmusicians {{were asked to}} rate the perceived <b>tension</b> of <b>chords</b> which were drawn either from a piece composed for the study (Exp. 1) or from a Chopin Prelude (Exps. 2 ± 4). In Exps. 3 and 4, several experimental manipulations were made to emphasize either the global or the local structure of the piece and to verify how these manipultions would a€ect the respective contribution of the models in the ratings. In all experiments, musical tension was only weakly in¯uenced by global harmonic structure. Instead, it mainly seemed to be determined locally, by harmonic cadences. The hierarchic model of Lerdahl and Jackendo€ provided the best ®t to tension ratings, not because it accounted for global hierarchic e€ects, but because it captured the local e€ect of cadences. By reacting to these local structures, tension ratings ®t quite well with a hierarchic model, even though the participants were relatively insensitive to the global structure of the pieces. As a main outcome, it is argued that musical events were perceived through a short perceptual window sliding from cadence to cadence along a sequence...|$|R

50|$|Growls can be {{obtained}} with various voice effects, but the effects are usually used to enhance rather than create, and are seldom used at all.

However, each of these technologies may have a different response to the same defect, based on the physics of the technology. As a result, test results may vary between each of the techniques. Critical defects such as cracks may be detected by one technology, but not by another, leading to inconsistent results and undermining confidence in the test results.

Lerdahls goals include quantification of areas {{of tension and}} relaxation perceived by listeners experienced in Western tonal music. Tension is associated with instability, distance, uncommon tones, and weak attractional force; relaxation with stability, proximity, common tones, and strong attractional force. Quantification requires creation of a time-span segmentation derived from the metrical grid and grouping analysis of the score. The time-span segmentation is necessary for creating the time-span reduction. The time-span reduction removes structurally less significant elements from the musical surface {{through a series of}} steps not unlike the layers of Schenkerian analysis. The ultimate goal is the prolongational reduction accompanied by prolongational tree. Global tension is quantified by summing values obtained when considering the region in which an event occurs, distance between successive chords revealed by their position on the chordal circle-of-fifths, number of distinct pitch classes between successive <b>chords,</b> <b>tension</b> inherited by subordinate chords from superordinate chords, melodic and harmonic attraction, and surface dissonance. Lerdahls Surface Tension Rule assigns tension added values due to chord Inversion, chord note in the top voice (Melody), and nonharmonic chord tones. This study tested the validity of assigned tension added values for Inversion and Melody asking 82 participants familiar with Western tonal music to rate perceived tension of Major and minor four-note chords heard devoid of tonal and musical contexts. Results showed Lerdahls tension added values required modification. Root position chords and chords with the root in the Melody require a tension added value greater than 0. Tension due to First Inversion {{is not the same as}} tension due to Second Inversion. Tension due to First and Second Inversion is greater than tension due to the third or fifth of a <b>chord</b> in Melody. <b>Tension</b> due to Second Inversion is not different from tension due to root in Melody. A new category, chord Quality, needed to be added. Expertise did not play a role. Lerdahls model and these results provide insight for performers, teachers, listeners, and composers...|$|R
