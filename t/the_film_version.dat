5|$|A play, First Class Man by Alter Ego Productions, {{was based}} on David Freeman's First Class Man. The play is centred around Ramanujan and his complex and {{dysfunctional}} relationship with Hardy. On 16 October 2011, {{it was announced that}} Roger Spottiswoode, best known for his James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, is working on <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>version,</b> starring actor Siddharth.

5|$|As with The Quatermass Xperiment, the {{screenplay}} for Quatermass 2 condenses {{many of the}} events of the original. The most significant change is at the climax: in the television version Quatermass and his assistant, Pugh, use Quatermass's rocket to travel to the asteroid to take on the aliens on their home turf whereas in the film the rocket is fired, unmanned, at the asteroid to destroy it. Several characters from the television version do not appear in the film, most notably Quatermass's daughter, Paula, and his assistant, Leo Pugh. Conversely, the character of Inspector Lomax reappears in <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>version,</b> having previously been in The Quatermass Xperiment, but does not appear in the television version. The character of Sheila the barmaid also appears only in <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>version.</b>|$|E

5|$|During {{that same}} year, Opus Dei {{received}} some unwanted attention {{due to the}} extraordinary success of the novel The Da Vinci Code, in which both Opus Dei and the Catholic Church itself are depicted negatively. <b>The</b> <b>film</b> <b>version</b> was released globally in May 2006, further polarizing views on the organization.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{while working}} on <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>version</b> of the stage play The Crucible, he visited the home of playwright Arthur Miller where he was {{introduced}} to the writer's daughter, Rebecca Miller.

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>version</b> of Dreamgirls, Beyoncé {{portrays the}} {{character}} of Deena Jones, a pop singer loosely based on Motown star Diana Ross. The story explores the life of The Dreams (based on The Supremes), a fictional 1960s group of three female singers: Effie White (Jennifer Hudson), Deena Jones and Lorrell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose), whose manager Curtis Taylor (based on Berry Gordy and played by Jamie Foxx) manipulates their personal and professional relationships.|$|E

5|$|The western mid-stream pier was rebuilt in 1804. Further {{alteration}} {{took place}} in 1895, when the western pavilion was moved {{for the construction of}} the Grand Parade. The appearance changed yet again when the current weir, the scene of Javert's suicide in <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>version</b> of Les Misérables, was constructed between 1968 and 1972 as part of a flood-prevention scheme. Further restoration was undertaken in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Although Murphy was {{initially}} reluctant {{to appear as}} himself in To Hell and Back, <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>version</b> of his book, he eventually agreed to do so. Terry Murphy portrayed his brother Joseph Preston Murphy at age four. The film was directed by Jesse Hibbs with an on-screen introduction by General Walter Bedell Smith. Susan Kohner, daughter of Murphy's agent Paul Kohner, made her acting debut in the film. The finale shows Murphy being awarded the Medal of Honor while images of his unit's casualties pass across the screen. It became the biggest hit {{in the history of}} Universal Studios at the time.|$|E
5|$|For preview screenings, {{the series}} was edited to an 83-minute feature film. The global premiere of <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>version</b> was on June 23, 2005, at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco, for the 29th Frameline Film Festival.

Similarly, in 1995 Kneale scripted a four-part adaptation of one of Kerr's sequels to the book, A Small Person Far Away, but this also went unproduced.|$|E
5|$|Manne {{frequently}} {{collaborated with}} Mancini in television as well, {{such as in}} the series Peter Gunn (19581961) and Mr. Lucky (19591960). Although Mancini developed such a close partnership with Manne that he was using him for practically all his scores and other music at this time, the drummer still found time to perform on movie soundtracks and in TV shows with music by others, including the series Richard Diamond (music by Pete Rugolo, 19591960), and Checkmate (music by John Williams, 19591962), and <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>version</b> of Leonard Bernstein's West Side Story (1961).|$|E

The film débuted at number one {{at the box office}} and held that position for two weeks. It made a total of $796.7million worldwide, which made it the second highest-grossing film of 2004 behind Shrek 2.

The film ranks at number 471 in Empire magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>film</b> <b>version</b> of {{the novel}} {{has not been the}} only movie to have a {{character}} borrowing some aspects of Wintour.

Fey Sommers in the Ugly Betty television series was also likened to Wintour, from the trademark bob and sunglasses, to Wintour's last name homophonous with 'Winter', while Sommers' is homophonous with 'Summer'.|$|E
