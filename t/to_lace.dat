5|$|In agriculture, the {{increased}} usage of sheep with long-fibred wool allowed a stronger thread to be spun. In addition, the spinning wheel replaced the traditional distaff for spinning wool, tripling production. A less technological refinement that still greatly affected daily {{life was the}} use of buttons as closures for garments, which allowed for better fitting without having <b>to</b> <b>lace</b> clothing on the wearer. Windmills were refined with the creation of the tower mill, allowing {{the upper part of the}} windmill to be spun around to face the direction from which the wind was blowing. The blast furnace appeared around 1350 in Sweden, increasing the quantity of iron produced and improving its quality. The first patent law in 1447 in Venice protected the rights of inventors to their inventions.|$|E

25|$|Boxing gloves {{usually come}} with either lace-ups or velcro. In velcro gloves, the velcro {{acts as a}} second handwrap that adds more {{stability}} to the wrist.

25|$|Up {{until the}} 1980s, {{the most common}} {{mounting}} system used twisted strips of cowhide as rope. The skin was attached with rings made of cowhide; one ring was sown into {{the perimeter of the}} skin and a second ring placed below it, with loops holding the skin in place and securing the two rings together. A long strip of cowhide was used <b>to</b> <b>lace</b> up the drum, applying tension between the top ring and a third ring placed around the stem. To apply further tension, the vertical sections of the rope were woven into a diamond pattern that shortens the verticals. Wooden pegs wedged between the shell and the lacing could be used to increase tension still further.|$|E

500|$|Carla is {{the eldest}} of the four daughters. As is common for the oldest sibling, she is {{somewhat}} seen as the mediator between the four sisters in the novel. [...] "As the therapist in the family Carla likes {{to be the one}} who understands everything" [...] and [...] "has a tendency <b>to</b> <b>lace</b> all her compliments with calls to self-improvement". [...] However to her sisters, this creates a somewhat dominating character at times reminiscent of their mother. Her criticism goes farther when she writes an autobiographical paper calling her mother mildly anal-retentive. [...] In Carla’s first and perhaps most prominent story in the novel, [...] "Trespass", as she is walking home from school in New York, a man exposes himself to her and attempts to lure her into his car. Alvarez uses Carla's character to display the language difficulties faced with only having [...] "classroom English", and how communication barriers affect immigrants.|$|E
500|$|Following the album's release, hip hop artists {{increasingly}} {{began to}} draw upon a broad stable of producers for their projects. At the time, the assembly of big-name producers was unprecedented, since most hip hop albums had primarily been the work of one dedicated producer and sometimes an embedded production team. Yet author Adam Mansbach reflects {{on the impact of}} Illmatics noteworthy producers, writing: [...] "The psychological impact on the listener of having all these elite producers – some of whom, like Q-Tip, really weren’t known yet for doing outside production work at all – coming together <b>to</b> <b>lace</b> the debut of this kid from Queensbridge was tremendous." [...] This same [...] would also be used by other successful East Coast rappers. In an article on New York hip hop, Mosi Reeves of Creative Loafing wrote that [...] "Nas' Illmatic [...] [...] [...] is the first to draw together top hip hop producers in the recording industry. That formula, most successfully mined by the late Notorious B.I.G. (1997's Life After Death), Puff Daddy (1997's No Way Out) and Jay-Z (1998's Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life), is what most N.Y. prospects still use today." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times writes that after Illmatics release, [...] “t became commonplace for rappers to search around for different producers who could enhance their sound." ...|$|E

50|$|It is a {{continuous}} lace, {{meaning that it}} was made in one piece on a lace pillow, using the same threads in the pattern as in the ground, or réseau. Antwerp lace is very similar <b>to</b> Mechlin <b>lace,</b> which was also made in Antwerp. Antwerp lace is heavier and sturdier than Mechlin lace. It has a cordonnet, or a flat thread outlining the pattern, just as Mechlin lace does. The cordonnet was very strong and rather coarse. Antwerp lace was also similar <b>to</b> Binche <b>lace</b> in its cordonnet. The réseau or ground for Antwerp lace varies from the same hexagonal ground as Mechlin <b>lace</b> <b>to</b> a tessellation-pattern featuring a six-pointed star.|$|R
500|$|The {{series has}} {{received}} positive reviews from critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club favorably noted its [...] "sheer and utter joyfulness" [...] {{and lack of}} cynicism, unlike many other shows that garnered a cult following of parents and adults. He complimented the characters' stylized appearance, the stories' relative complexity for children's television, and the solid jokes which make the show enjoyable for parents as well as children. He gave the series a B+. The show has been critically praised for its humor and moral outlook by Brian Truitt of USA Today. Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club later commented that Friendship Is Magic {{is an example of}} a show that, while considered [...] "girly", has been able to tap into the nerd culture to allow it to gain wider acceptance than other comparable forms. Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media, an organization focusing on the parenting aspect of children's media, gave the show a rating of four out of five stars, emphasizing its messages of friendship, tolerance and respect, but advised parents to be wary of the [...] "influence the characters might have on their kids' desires, since it's rooted in a well-known product line of books, toys, and just about everything in between." [...] Liz Ohanesian, for L.A. Weekly, said that the show is [...] "absolutely genuine in its messages about friendship but never takes itself too seriously". Matt Morgan, writing for Wireds [...] "GeekDad" [...] column, praised the show for having [...] "rebooted the long-time Hasbro property while managing <b>to</b> <b>lace</b> it with geeky undertones" [...] and being one of the few [...] "girl-focused shows that a geeky dad can appreciate with his daughter". Los Angeles Times critic Robert Lloyd called the show [...] "smarter and sassier and more aesthetically sophisticated" [...] than any of the previous My Little Pony cartoons, and praised its ability to appeal to both children and their parents, in that it is [...] "smart and sprightly and well-staged, and never horribly cute". TV Guide listed Friendship Is Magic as one of the top sixty animated shows of all time in a September 2013 list.|$|E

The partnership did not prove to be successful and the pair narrowly avoided steering Burnley into the bottom tier of English football.

Roeder proved to be both an unpopular and controversial figure to the Burnley fans, hitting a low point when he was reported to have said that star player Glen Little was [...] "not fit <b>to</b> <b>lace</b> the boots" [...] of manager Chris Waddle. Roeder left his role at Burnley alongside Waddle when the pair departed the club after only a single season in charge.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{recent studies}} {{demonstrate}} how the PA63 pore allows the EF and LF into the cytoplasm when its lumen is so small. The lumen on the PA63 pore is only 15 Å (1.5nm) across, {{which is much}} smaller than the diameter of LF or EF. [...] Translocation occurs through a series of events which begin in the endosome as it acidifies. LF and EF are pH sensitive, and as the pH drops, their structures lose stability. Below a pH of 6.0 (the pH in an endosome), both LF and EF become disordered molten globules. When a molecule is in this conformation, the N-terminus is freed and drawn into the pore by the proton gradient and positive transmembrane potential. A ring of seven phenylalanines at the mouth endosome side of the pore (phenylalanine clamp) assists in the unfolding of LF or EF by interacting with the hydrophobic residues found in LF or EF. The proton gradient then begins <b>to</b> <b>lace</b> the protein though the pore. The lacing mechanism is driven by the gradient, but requires the phenylalanine clamp for a ratcheting motion. The first 250 residues of EF and LF have an irregular alternating sequence of basic, acidic, and hydrophobic residues. The interplay between the phenylalanine clamp and the protonation state cause a ratcheting effect that drives the protein though until enough has crossed into the cytoplasm to drag the rest through the pore as the N-terminus refolds (Fig. 11).|$|E
