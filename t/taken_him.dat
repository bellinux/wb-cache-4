5|$|Bond's adventures have <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> to over sixty countries, {{as well as}} outer space, in {{locations}} mostly {{described as}} attractive and exotic. These locations are primarily real places, though on occasion—such as San Monique (Live and Let Die) and Isthmus (Licence to Kill)—the destinations have been fictional.|$|E
5|$|Work on Siti Akbari was {{completed}} {{over a period}} of several years. Lie stated that the story had <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> three years, writing sporadically. Tio, however, reports rumours that the writing took some seven years, with Lie sometimes taking long breaks and sometimes writing in a fervor, writing from dawn until dusk.|$|E
5|$|Harvard University offered Holst a lectureship for {{the first}} six months of 1932. Arriving via New York he was pleased to be reunited with his brother, Emil, whose acting career under the name of Ernest Cossart had <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> to Broadway; but Holst was dismayed by the continual attentions of press interviewers and photographers. He enjoyed his time at Harvard, but was taken ill while there: a {{duodenal}} ulcer prostrated him for some weeks. He returned to England, joined briefly by his brother for a holiday together in the Cotswolds. His health declined, and he withdrew further from musical activities. One of his last efforts was to guide the young players of the St Paul's Girls' School orchestra through one of his final compositions, the Brook Green Suite, in March 1934.|$|E

"Toomuch," [...] he said, [...] "take our {{inquisitive}} friend {{out into}} the town; <b>take</b> <b>him</b> to the Bosphorous; <b>take</b> <b>him</b> to the island where the dogs are; <b>take</b> <b>him</b> anywhere." [...] He paused to whisper a few instructions into the ear of the Secretary. [...] "You understand," [...] he said, [...] "well, <b>take</b> <b>him.</b> As for me,"--he gave a great yawn as he shuffled away, [...] "I am about to withdraw into my Inner Harem. Goodbye. I regret that I cannot invite you in." ...|$|R

5|$|By early 1957, Fisher {{had lost}} {{patience}} with Häyhänen {{and demanded that}} Moscow recall his deputy. In January 1957, Häyhänen received a message from Moscow promoting him to Lieutenant Colonel and granting him leave in the Soviet Union. Upon hearing he was due to return to Moscow, Häyhänen was fearful {{that he would be}} severely disciplined or even executed. Häyhänen fabricated stories to justify his delay, claiming to Fisher that the FBI had <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> off the RMS Queen Mary. Fisher, unsuspecting, advised Häyhänen to leave the U.S. immediately to avoid FBI surveillance and handed him two hundred dollars for travel expenses. Prior to his departure, Häyhänen returned to Bear Mountain Park and retrieved the buried five thousand dollars for his own use. Häyhänen arrived in Paris on May Day, having sailed from the U.S. aboard La Liberté. Making contact with the KGB residency he received another two hundred dollars for his journey to Moscow. Four days later, instead of continuing his journey to the Soviet Union he entered the American embassy in Paris, announcing that he was a KGB officer and asking for asylum.|$|E
5|$|Charles Voorhis's {{job with}} Nash had <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> {{to a new}} home in Kenosha, Wisconsin; Jerry Voorhis joined his parents there on his return from Europe. As part of his {{recovery}} from his illness, he spent several weeks in northwestern Wyoming, working on a ranch. In Kenosha, he met a social worker named Alice Louise Livingston and married her on November 27, 1924, in her hometown of Washington, Iowa. Resuming his blue-collar career after his marriage, Voorhis moved to North Carolina with his wife and went to work in a Ford plant in Charlotte until being offered work as a teacher in an Illinois school for underprivileged boys, teaching three grades, coaching sports, and giving religious talks in the school's chapel each morning. This was followed by a year in Laramie, Wyoming, where the Voorhises founded and ran an orphanage for boys.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Kathleen, <b>take</b> <b>him</b> {{all over}} the gardens, the orchards, the corrals and barns," [...] {{directed}} Lenore. [...] "Be sure to show him the horses--my horses, especially. <b>Take</b> <b>him</b> round the reservoir--and everywhere except the wheat-fields. I want to <b>take</b> <b>him</b> there myself. Besides, father does not want you girls {{to go out to}} the harvest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why those fiends <b>took</b> <b>him</b> in so long? No doubt, {{though his}} {{indifference}} {{must have been}} awful. As I'm not a fiend, at any rate, I shouldn't <b>take</b> <b>him</b> in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's mad! He's mad!" [...] {{said the}} officer, with delirious conclusiveness. [...] "Take <b>him</b> away, <b>take</b> <b>him</b> away, <b>take</b> <b>him</b> away--put him somewhere, master-at-arms. Stay, one test more. What mess do you belong to?" ...|$|R
5|$|Halotus, as the Emperor's {{official}} taster, {{would probably}} have {{had a role in}} the plot, deceiving Claudius into believing the food was safe to consume. He is a prime suspect because he would have had access to everything eaten by the Emperor on the night of his death. It has been suggested that Halotus may have been the murderer but was working under orders of Agrippina. While it is uncertain whether Halotus would have had anything to gain from the death of the Emperor, Agrippina's political and personal advantage gained by the death of her husband was evident; with Claudius dead, Nero, Agrippina's biological son, would be able to claim the throne. It was also known that the animosity between Agrippina and Claudius had grown during the months preceding the homicide. Other notable suspects included Locusta, a professional poisoner, and Xenophon, Claudius' royal physician, who, in line with the suggestion that the poison was not immediately fatal, is said to have carried an ailing Claudius out of the banquet, <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> to his room and forced a poisoned feather into his mouth on the pretence of encouraging him to regurgitate. Others say Xenophon used poisoned gruel.|$|E
5|$|On 28 May the {{conclave}} unanimously elected Orsini as Pope. He had {{not been}} seen as a serious candidate in past conclaves because he did not have political experience. Orsini was 75 at the time, and it took the cardinals two days to convince him to accept his election. He was recorded to have spent the night before his election sleepless and in tears. Even when the cardinals had <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> into the Sistine Chapel for the formal vote to elect him pope after they had been convinced he would accept, he was still unwilling to accept his own election. Ultimately, he only accepted it after being convinced of it by Agustín Pipia the Master of the Dominican Order, of which he was a member. Upon accepting his election, he attempted to take the name Benedict XIV, which would have recognized Antipope Benedict XIII, the last Avignon Pope during the Western Schism. Lawyers from the Roman Curia eventually persuaded Orisini to take the name Benedict XIII.|$|E
5|$|Aleppo {{was then}} a major {{intellectual}} center of the Ottoman Empire, featuring many thinkers and writers concerned with {{the future of the}} Arabs. It was in the French missionary schools that the Marrash family learnt Arabic with French and other foreign languages (Italian and English). But Francis at first studied the Arabic language and its literature privately. At the age of four years, Marrash had contracted measles, and had ever since suffered from eye problems that had kept worsening over time. Hoping to find a treatment, his father had therefore <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> to Paris in 1850; Francis stayed there for about a year, after which he was sent back to Aleppo while his father remained in Paris. In 1853, Francis accompanied his father once again, on a business trip of several months to Beirut, where there was a noticeable presence and cultural influence of Europeans. Francis experienced similar cultural contact later on, when he received private tutoring in medicine for four years under a British physician, in Aleppo—he had by then developed a keen interest in science, and in medicine in particular. At the same time, he wrote and published several works. Marrash practiced medicine for about a year; however, deeming it safer for his trade to become a state-licensed physician, he went to Paris in 1866 so as to continue his medical education at a school. But his fragile health and his growing blindness forced him to interrupt his studies within a year after his arrival. He returned to Aleppo completely blind, but still managed to dictate his works.|$|E

60|$|Big Alec {{had never}} been {{captured}} by the fish patrol. It was his boast that no man could <b>take</b> <b>him</b> alive, {{and it was his}} history that of the many men who had tried to <b>take</b> <b>him</b> dead none had succeeded. It was also history that at least two patrolmen who had tried to <b>take</b> <b>him</b> dead had died themselves. Further, no man violated the fish laws more systematically and deliberately than Big Alec.|$|R
