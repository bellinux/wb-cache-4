5|$|Due to {{the appeal}} of <b>the</b> <b>books</b> among an adult audience, Bloomsbury {{commissioned}} a second line of editions in an 'adult' style.

5|$|With two authors at {{the time}} Holmes {{decided to have a}} {{pseudonym}} since having two authors would place <b>the</b> <b>books</b> at different places at libraries, confusing and possibly scaring off potential readers.

5|$|Also in 2003, {{courts in}} the Netherlands {{prevented}} the distribution of a Dutch translation of Tanya Grotter and the Magical Double Bass, the first of Dmitri Yemets' popular Russian series about a female apprentice wizard. Rowling and her publishers sued, arguing that the Grotter books violate copyright law. Yemets and his original Moscow-based publishers, Eksmo, argued that <b>the</b> <b>books</b> constitute a parody, permitted under copyright. The Dutch courts ruled that <b>the</b> <b>books</b> did not constitute parody and thus {{were not allowed to}} be sold in the Netherlands. Later that year, as the Dutch translation Tanja Grotter en de magische contrabas was still legal in Belgium, the Flemish publishers Roularta Books decided to print 1,000 copies (and no more) in order to let people decide whether it was plagiarism, hoping that under those circumstances Rowling and her publishers would not sue. Rowling did not sue, but as {{there was a lot of}} interest in the book (Dutch people could buy the book by postal order from another Flemish publisher, Boekhandel VanIn) it was soon sold out. <b>The</b> <b>books</b> continue to be published in Russia and have spawned several sequels.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{sketches}} were derived almost exclusively from <b>the</b> <b>books,</b> whose multimedia approach, consisting of short anecdotes interspersed with cartoons, diaries, newspaper articles and recipes, proved easily adaptable {{to the screen}} either as raw material or creative inspiration. In later series, as usable material from <b>the</b> <b>books</b> and other obvious sources began to run out, concepts were drawn from more standard historical texts under Jenner's supervision. He and fellow researchers read through many different studies and picked out suitably quirky, intriguing snippets, which were then pitched to the writers for development.|$|E
5|$|Barley evidently {{decided that}} it was futile to {{continue}} resisting the Stationers' Company, and on 15 May 1605, he successfully petitioned the Drapers' Company for a transfer to the Stationers' Company. On 25 June 1606, the Stationers' Company admitted him as a member. That same day, the Company's court, which had the authority to resolve disputes between members, negotiated a settlement in a lawsuit Barley had brought against East concerning the copyrights on certain music books. East claimed that since he had lawfully entered <b>the</b> <b>books</b> into the Company's register, the rights of the works belonged to him. Barley disagreed, claiming that the works were his through his partnership with Morley, who had held the royal music patent. The court's compromise settlement recognised the rights of both, stipulating that if East were to print an edition of any of <b>the</b> <b>books</b> in question, he was to acknowledge Barley's name on the imprint, pay Barley 20 shillings, and supply him with six free copies. On the other hand, Barley could not publish any of <b>the</b> <b>books</b> without the consent of East or his wife.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>book</b> was commercially successful. By October 2006, <b>the</b> <b>book</b> {{went through}} three printings.

40|$|In Jewish tradition, <b>the</b> <b>book</b> as an &ldquo;exemplary&rdquo;, <b>the</b> <b>book</b> as an &ldquo;object&rdquo; is {{associated}} with an attitude of veneration as expressed by Pierre Chaunu in &ldquo;livre en majeste&rdquo; &ndash; <b>the</b> <b>book</b> in its majesty when referring to the Holy Bible. The content of <b>the</b> <b>book</b> is revealed by its own referentiality enclosed in its text and by its unfolding through reading. On the other hand, the title of <b>the</b> <b>book</b> may suggest <b>the</b> plenitude of its text, a semantic sublimation, an essentialization {{of the content of}} <b>the</b> <b>book.</b> This is rendered by means of the metaphor, for metaphor implies a &ldquo;translation&rdquo; of significance and senses within syntagmas and word associations that exceed the referential meaning. Therefore, several metaphorical categories may be discerned in <b>the</b> Hebrew <b>book</b> titles. A first category would concentrate symbolic, spectacular, luminiferous values in which light is the main attribute of <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> an attribute made up by superposing the light and the celestial, both defining <b>the</b> Divine: <b>the</b> <b>BOOK</b> as LIGHT. A second category of metaphoric phrasing would incorporate ethical &ndash; theological values. <b>The</b> metaphor <b>BOOK</b> as GATE codifies the idea of accessing, of entering in a livresque, bookish universe open to interpretation. <b>The</b> <b>BOOK</b> as PURITY and GRACE, <b>the</b> <b>BOOK</b> as BRIDE, <b>the</b> <b>BOOK</b> as CITADEL, <b>the</b> <b>BOOK</b> as THERAPY, <b>the</b> healing <b>book</b> would enter <b>the</b> same category. The metaphoric repertoire reaches its climax with <b>the</b> <b>BOOK</b> as HOLINESS, a syntagma that induces the semantics of writing as a sacred task. Other significant metaphors included in <b>the</b> Hebrew <b>book</b> titles are: <b>the</b> <b>BOOK</b> as ADORNEMENT, <b>the</b> <b>BOOK</b> as SPLENDOR, etc...|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} for Parasite Pig has been mostly positive.

5|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, Ace's output was {{approaching}} one hundred titles a year, still heavily {{dominated by the}} primary genres. Almost all <b>the</b> <b>books</b> were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced {{an increase in the}} price of <b>the</b> <b>books,</b> and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of Frank Herbert's Dune, were priced at 95 cents. With Ballantine Books, Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.|$|E
