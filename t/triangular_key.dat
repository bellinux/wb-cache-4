40|$|A direct {{approach}} to calculating the hypersingular integral for a threedimensional Galerkin approximation is presented. The method does not employ either Stokes' Theorem or a regularization process {{to transform the}} integrand before the evaluation is carried out.

40|$|Several {{parallel}} algorithms {{have been}} proposed for the solution of triangular systems. The stability of four of them is analysed here: a fan-in algorithm, a block elimination method, a method based on a factorized power series expansion of the matrix inverse, and a method based on a divide and conquer matrix inversion technique. New forward error and residual bounds are derived, including an improvement on the bounds of Sameh and Brent for the fan-in algorithm.

40|$|To date, {{there has}} been little, or no {{published}} psychological research into Australian grade cricket culture. With the vast increase in commercial opportunities for professional cricketers, the stakes are higher than ever in the upper echelons of grade cricket. These opportunities appear to {{have led to a}} shift in first grade cricket culture, dominated by the importance of individual performance, particularly in first grade cricket. Using Schein’s model of organisational culture, this study examined the Australian first grade cricket culture, and its link with performance, from the player’s perspective. In this study, individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight first-grade cricketers on their perceptions of first grade cricket culture, and its relationship with their performance.

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} finding the {{smallest}} order of a p-group of a given derived length has a long history. Nilpotent Lie algebra versions of this and related problems are considered. Thus, the smallest order of a p-group is replaced by the smallest dimension of a nilpotent Lie algebra. For each length t, an upper bound for this smallest dimension is found. Also, it is shown that for each t ≥ 5 there is a two generated Lie algebra of nilpotent class d = 21 (2 t− 5) whose derived length is t. For two generated Lie algebras, this result is best possible. Results for small t are also found. The results are obtained by constructing Lie algebras of strictly upper <b>triangular</b> matrices. <b>Key</b> words. Two generated, Three generated.

Given a triangular mesh and a vector field, the method first scores all possible quadrilaterals that can be formed by pairs of adjacent triangles, according to their shape and directionality. It then converts the pairs into quadrilateral elements in order of the scores to form a quadrilateral mesh. Engineering analyses with finite element methods occasionally require a quadrilateral mesh well aligned along the boundary geometry or the directionality of some physical phenomena, {{such as in the}} directions of a streamline, shock boundary, or force propagation vectors.

Coding theory takes place in finite dimensional linear spaces over finite fields. One of the main questions of the theory (classical problem) asks to find a k-dimensional subspace in F n q, the space of n-tuples over the finite field Fq, with the largest minimum distance possible. There are many possible metrics that can be defined in F n q, the most common ones are the Hamming and Lee metrics. In 1987 Harald Niederreiter generalized the classical problem of coding theory (see [7]). Brualdi, Graves and Lawrence (see [2]) also provided in 1995 a wider situation for the above problem: using partially ordered sets and defining the concept of poset-codes, they started to study codes with a posetmetric. This has been a fruitful approach, since many new perfect codes have been found with such poset metrics (see [1], [2], [3], [5] and [6]) ...|$|R

40|$|A CFD {{analysis}} of the hydrodynamic interactions between three vertical axis tidal turbines set in close proximity is performed for two layout: side-by-side and <b>triangular.</b> The following <b>key</b> mechanisms are found to determine a power increasing with respect to isolated turbines: (1) turbine blockage that entails flow acceleration outside of the turbines and inside the aisles between adjacent turbines; (2) more favorable direction of the flow approaching the blade during upwind; (3) wake contraction, that increases torque generation during downwind. Blockage is responsible for a moderate performance increasing exhibited by the triangular layout. Change {{in the direction of}} the flow approaching the blades and wake contraction only occur for side-by-side layout, and lead to a significant increasing of efficiency. The side-by-side layout allows a wider range of flow directions that make possible a power gain, and thus it could be adoptable for tidal currents characterized by an incomplete inversion of the current direction.

Many researchers advocated to completely bypass smooth surface representations, and to stick to a dense mesh model throughout the design process.

Para dicho propósito, se examinarán una serie de advertencias metodológicas decantadas por él, en textos como Microfísica del Poder, La Voluntad de Saber y Vigilar y Castigar. Precauciones de método que se desarrollan en contraposición a las teorías jurídico-políticas del siglo XVI y XVII, que conciben el poder como ley prohibitiva, en términos negativos o en términos de represión. Concepción del poder de la que Foucault toma distancia, pues para él, el poder debe ser considerado como una red productiva que atraviesa todo el cuerpo social, más que como una instancia negativa que tiene como única función reprimir.
