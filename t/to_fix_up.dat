25|$|After {{an interim}} 1.3 version <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> <b>up</b> many {{remaining}} {{problems with the}} 1.x series, IBM released OS/2 version 2.0 in 1992. This was a major improvement: it featured a new, object-oriented GUI, the Workplace Shell (WPS), that included a desktop and was {{considered by many to}} be OS/2's best feature. Microsoft would later imitate much of it in Windows 95. Version 2.0 also provided a full 32-bit API, offered smooth multitasking and could take advantage of the 4gigabytes of address space provided by the Intel 80386. Still, much of the system had 16-bit code internally which required, among other things, device drivers to be 16-bit code also. This was one of the reasons for the chronic shortage of OS/2 drivers for the latest devices. Version 2.0 could also run DOS and Windows 3.0 programs, since IBM had retained the right to use the DOS and Windows code as a result of the breakup.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene with}} Grampa and Bea eating their pills seductively is a {{reference}} to the 1963 film Tom Jones. Two of the people waiting in line to ask for Grampa's money are Darth Vader and the Joker. When the family is suggesting places they could go, Homer suggests the Springfield Mystery Spot, {{a reference to}} the Mystery Spot in California—although Lisa says that the Springfield Spot is simply a puddle of mud. They eventually decide to go to the Discount Lion Safari, however. The Diz-Nee-Land amusement park that Grampa visits with Bea's money has a sign that reads [...] "Diz-Nee-Land—Not affiliated with Disneyland, Walt Disney World, or anything else from the Walt Disney Company". The shot of Grampa sitting at a diner resembles the 1942 American painting Nighthawks. Before Grampa attempts to bet all of his money on Roulette he quotes the poem [...] "If—" [...] by Rudyard Kipling. The climax scenes, where Grampa uses the money <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> <b>up</b> the Springfield Retirement Castle, is {{a reference to the}} ending of the 1932 film If I Had a Million. Dr. Marvin Monroes 'Monroe Box' is meant to be a spoof of B. F. Skinners Skinner Box.|$|E

Because when I write a song it's always done very quickly, completed in 20minutes or maybe half an hour. I never labour anything, or very rarely. The only labouring I've ever done in songwriting might be when I've completed a work, a song, and {{there might be a}} couple of lyrics I don't like, so sometimes I might sit with those and really put some brain power in how <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> <b>up</b> the lines.
