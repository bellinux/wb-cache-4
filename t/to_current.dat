5|$|A feature {{coming into}} wide use in modern shortwave {{receivers}} is DSP technology, short for digital signal processing. DSP {{is the use}} of digital means to process signals, and a primary benefit in shortwave receivers is the ability to tailor the bandwidth of the receiver <b>to</b> <b>current</b> reception conditions and to the type of signal being listened to. A typical analog-only receiver may have a limited number of fixed bandwidths, or only one, but a DSP receiver may have 40 or more individually selectable filters.|$|E
5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>current</b> knowledge, B.sessilis as an {{extremely}} hardy plant that {{grows in a}} range of soils and aspects, so long as it is given good drainage, and tolerates both drought and moderate frost. Unlike many dryandras, it grows well on limestone (alkaline) soils. It flowers very heavily and is an excellent producer of honey. It attracts birds, and is also popular with beekeepers. However, its size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens, and if given an ideal situation it may produce a great many seedlings. It is propagated only from seed, as propagating it from cuttings has proven virtually impossible. Germination takes about five or six weeks, and plants may take two years to flower.|$|E

5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>current</b> {{physical}} cosmology theory, carbon {{is formed}} in the interiors of stars in the horizontal branch by the collision and transformation of three helium nuclei.

The Solar System is one such star system with an abundance of carbon, enabling the existence of life as we know it.|$|E

The USAF is now performing a series of incremental improvements, mainly to avionics, to bring the E-3 up <b>to</b> <b>current</b> standards of performance.

5|$|Halo Wars is a {{real-time}} strategy (RTS) {{video game}} developed {{exclusively for the}} Xbox 360 console, in which players command armies from a bird's-eye view of the battlefield. The game focuses on military combat, but contains streamlined resource management and base construction elements. It was designed with the Xbox 360 controller in mind; for example, the A button is used for selecting units. A single tap of the button selects one unit, while a double tap selects all units of the same type. The d-pad navigates <b>to</b> <b>current</b> battles and cycles through bases, while the right analog stick adjusts the camera angle. A radial menu is used for base construction.|$|E
