50|$|A <b>tap</b> <b>wrench</b> is a {{hand tool}} used to turn taps or other small tools, such as hand reamers and screw extractors.|$|E
50|$|In Commonwealth English (excluding Canada), spanner is the {{standard}} term. The most common shapes are called open-ended spanner and ring spanner. The term wrench is generally used for tools that turn non-fastening devices (e.g. <b>tap</b> <b>wrench</b> and pipe wrench), or {{may be used for}} a monkey wrench - an adjustable spanner.|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{sizes of}} <b>tap</b> <b>wrenches</b> are {{required}} to cover the available size range of tool heads. Generally speaking, the smallest size which accommodates the tool head is recommended because it {{reduces the risk of}} breakage from excessive force.|$|R
5000|$|North Bros. key {{acquisition}} was {{the hiring}} of Zachary Furbish when it purchased the Forest City Screwdriver Co in 1897. He brought with him patents related to a spiral ratchet screw driver and considerable experience in tool design. This was their foothold into the tool manufacturing industry which would later become the core of their business. Furbish alone would eventually amass 30 patents related to hand tools produced by North Bros., despite passing away in 1906, and his designs would become the backbone of their product lines for years to come. North Bros. tool brand was called Yankee, much like how Sears tools are branded Craftsman, and every tool they sold sported this trademark. In later years the [...] Yankee name would become synonymous with the spiral ratchet screw driver invented by Furbish but it was originally seen on everything from bench vises to cutting tools. Building upon the line of tools originally made by Forest City, North Bros. soon expanded their selection of offerings. Screwdrivers were joined by push drills, breast drills, hand drills (also called egg beater drills), hand powered bench drills, bit and braces, ratcheting <b>tap</b> <b>wrenches,</b> vises, cutting tools and small tool kits.|$|R
50|$|The screw {{is first}} drilled {{out to the}} proper {{diameter}} for that extractor. The extractor is then inserted into this hole and turned counter-clockwise using a <b>tap</b> <b>wrench.</b> As the extractor is turned, the flutes on the tool dig into the screw, causing it to lock tightly and apply sufficient torque to remove the screw.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of tap wrenches: double-end {{adjustable}} wrenches and T-handle wrenches. Double-end adjustable wrenches, also known as bar wrenches, have one threaded handle which is attached {{to one of the}} clamps. The clamp is opened to insert the tool and then tightened down against the tool to secure it. This type of <b>tap</b> <b>wrench</b> is used with larger taps and where there is room to turn a larger wrench.|$|E
5000|$|A T-handle is more compact. This type of wrench uses a collet {{to secure}} the tool. The collet design has two pieces: a {{threaded}} [...] "nosecap" [...] and four collet fingers; the collet fingers thread {{on the outside and}} the nosecap is screwed onto them. The nosecap is tapered, which causes the fingers to clamp onto the tool. This style <b>tap</b> <b>wrench</b> is useful in confined spaces or where extra reach is required. The hole which forms the collet fingers may be graduated/ sloped or may be stepped (i.e., have multiple diameters, usually two). The former accommodates a wide range of taps, but does not hold any of them with special security; the latter will accommodate two different sizes of taps (only) but will hold either with exceptional strength.|$|E
