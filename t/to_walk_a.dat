5|$|Conversely, his 1980s musical {{repertoire}} {{presented an}} increased development of dance trends, such as disco and soul, {{as well as}} the previous incorporation of rock and punk. However, Gil says that his 1994 album Acoustic was not such a new direction, as he had previously performed unplugged with Caetano Veloso. He describes the method of playing as easier than other types of performance, as the energy of acoustic playing is simple and influenced by its roots. Gil has been criticized for a conflicting involvement in both authentic Brazilian music and the worldwide musical arena. He has had <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>a</b> fine line, simultaneously remaining true to traditional Bahian styles and engaging with commercial markets. Listeners in Bahia have been much more accepting of his blend of music styles, while those in southeast Brazil felt at odds with it.|$|E
5|$|On April 28, 2014, {{pedestrian}} {{access to}} the station was partially cut off when the abutting landowner erected a fence on the station's primary access point, forcing riders <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>a</b> short distance along the tracks to a different business lot, {{in an effort to}} stop commuters from parking on his business lots. He removed a section of the fence for platform access after meeting with the MBTA, but disputed whether he was required to provide access and station facilities according to the terms of the 1960 land sale. Despite intervention by state legislators and a postcard campaign by residents, an agreement was not reached in 2014. In December 2014, the MBTA rejected a plan that would have created a pedestrian access path and a vehicle dropoff lane, alleging that the landowner had unfairly shifted property lines.|$|E
25|$|The shelters {{are made}} from aluminum, steel, and glass. Air {{ventilation}} works through fins on the aluminum part of the shelters. Floors {{are made from}} tread plate, although newer shelters now use concrete. The shelters are equipped with platform screen doors. Some of the connecting elevated bridge ramps have gentle slopes (with some exceptions) to accommodate the disabled. One disadvantage {{of some of the}} ramps is that passengers need <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>a</b> relatively long way up the ramps and then double back to reach the boarding shelters. The floors of the bridge are mostly tread plates although some are made from concrete. One problem with the tread plate is that considerable noise is generated by the movement of passengers across the tread plate surfaces. Another problem {{is that some of the}} tread plate surfaces can become very slippery during the rainy season. There are no sanitary facilities in most of the shelters.|$|E

25|$|Finally, motor-skill {{rehabilitation}} {{has been}} proposed as another possible way in which games {{can be used for}} rehabilitation purposes. Stroke patients suffering upper extremity motor difficulties have been the primary focus of this subject and, in this case, a variety of gaming environments have been experimented with. Output has shown that their Fugl-Meyer UE scores and their Functional Independence Measure scale score increase after a period of engaging in virtual rehabilitation, suggesting that their mobility dysfunction decreased and their degree of independence increased due to the intervention. Additionally, output has suggested improved motor skills on a higher level, having several researchers suggesting positive improvements in their stroke patients as a result of virtual rehabilitation methods. At this higher level, researchers have suggested improved ability to walk, or ambulation, and improved use of larger motor skills after intervention. One other class of patients that has been studied less frequently in this category of rehabilitation is cerebral palsy patients. Ability to walk certain distances without the use of an assistive device was the method of measurement for this category. After a period of working with a Wii-based system, it was shown that a patient who struggled with walking large distances before, was able <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>a</b> noticeably longer distance. This suggests an improvement in larger motor skills, whereas the stroke patients demonstrated an improvement in finer motor skills, focused strictly on their use of upper extremities during the gaming rehabilitation.|$|E

Tillman had <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>a</b> narrow {{line in the}} debates over lynching, since most of his supporters believed in the collective right of white men in a community to dispense mob justice, especially in cases of alleged rape. Yet as governor, he was sworn to uphold the rule of law. He attempted to finesse the matter by seeking to appeal to both sides, demanding that the law be followed, but that he would, as he stated in 1892, [...] "willingly lead a mob in lynching a Negro who had committed an assault on a white woman". Under criticism, he amended this to a willingness to lead the lynching of [...] "a man of any color who assaults a virtuous woman of any color"—the adjective [...] "virtuous" [...] limiting the commitment, in Tillman's view, to assaults on white women.|$|E

Nimoy however later agreed to a reappearance in the two-part season finale [...] "Over There". The visual effect of making Walter and Bell appear younger was produced by Zoic Studios.

[...] After Fiorello LaGuardia became mayor in 1934, Broderick and other police officers fell out of favor for connections with the Democratic Tammany Hall political machine. In 1934, by then assigned to the Manhattan District Attorney's office, he was reduced in rank to patrolman, his pay was cut by $1000 and he was transferred to Long Island City by police commissioner John F. O'Ryan. Syndicated columnist Westbrook Pegler said at the time that Broderick [...] "has been busted and sent out <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>a</b> beat because he has enjoyed for some years the endorsement and assistance {{of some of the most}} pernicious Tammany politicians in the city.

500|$|Zaillian {{discussed}} many of {{the themes}} in Larsson's Millennium series with Fincher, taking the pair deeper into the novel's darker subjects, such as the psychological dissimilarities between rapists and murderers. Fincher {{was familiar with the}} concept, from projects such as Seven (1995) and Zodiac (2007). Zaillian commented, [...] "A rapist, or at least our rapist, is about exercising his power over somebody. A serial killer is about destruction; they get off on destroying something. It's not about having power over something, it's about eliminating it. What thrills them is slightly different." [...] The duo wanted to expose the novels' pivotal themes, particularly misogyny. [...] "We were committed to the tack that this is a movie about violence against women about specific kinds of degradation, and you can't shy away from that. But {{at the same time you}} have <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>a</b> razor thin line so that the audience can viscerally feel the need for revenge but also see the power of the ideas being expressed." [...] Instead of the typical three-act structure, they reluctantly chose a five-act structure, which Fincher pointed out is [...] "very similar to a lot of TV cop dramas." ...|$|E
500|$|Though Reitman {{has claimed}} in countless {{interviews}} {{that he wrote}} the parts specifically for George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Danny McBride, Melanie Lynskey, Amy Morton, Sam Elliott and Zach Galifianakis, some of the actors publicly stated their confusion in Reitman's assertion, if only because they knew he was meeting with other actors all along including his choice to fill his last lead role with Ellen Page (who starred in Reitman's previous film Juno) for the part that Kendrick ultimately played. On the part played by Farmiga, he cited her ability <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>a</b> fine line between aggressiveness and femininity. On Kendrick, Reitman cited that he was inspired by her performance in Rocket Science. On Clooney, he said, [...] "If you're {{going to make a}} movie about a guy who fires people for a living and you still want to like him, that actor better be damn charming and I don't think there's a more charming actor alive than George Clooney.

Tor.com's Robert H. Bedford commended the way the different storylines were integrated and particularly enjoyed the interactions between Art and Sarah. Den of Geek critic Rob Kemp thought that the episode was well developed and felt that it stood out from [...] "the current crop of TV science fiction". He praised the serious nature of the episode as well as [...] "the effort that has gone into grounding the show into reality". Simon Cocks of CultBox gave [...] "Instinct" [...] 4 out of 5 stars, describing it as [...] "riveting television".
