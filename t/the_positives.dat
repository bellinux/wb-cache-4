5|$|Nixon {{instructed}} Agnew {{to avoid}} personal {{attacks on the}} press and the Democratic presidential nominee, South Dakota Senator George McGovern, to stress <b>the</b> <b>positives</b> of the Nixon administration, and not to comment on what might happen in 1976. At the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Agnew was greeted as a hero by delegates who saw him as the party's future. After being nominated for a second term, Agnew delivered an acceptance speech focused on the administration's accomplishments, and avoided his usual slashing invective, but he condemned McGovern for supporting busing, and alleged that McGovern, if elected, would beg the North Vietnamese for the return of American prisoners of war. The Watergate break-in was a minor issue in the campaign; for once, Agnew's exclusion from Nixon's inner circle worked in his favor, as he knew nothing of the matter until reading of it in the press, and upon learning from Jeb Magruder that administration officials were responsible for the break-in, cut off discussion of the matter. He viewed the break-in as foolish, and felt that both major parties routinely spied on each other. Nixon had instructed Agnew not to attack McGovern's initial running mate, Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton, and after Eagleton withdrew amid revelations concerning past mental health treatment, the president renewed those instructions for the new candidate, Sargent Shriver.|$|E

If a test has a false positive {{rate of one}} in ten thousand, but only {{one in a million}} samples (or people) is a true positive, most of <b>the</b> <b>positives</b> detected by that test will be false.

25|$|The {{theories}} of evidence based practice {{are becoming more}} commonplace in nursing care. Nurses who are “baccalaureate prepared are expected to seek out and collaborate {{with other types of}} nurses to demonstrate <b>the</b> <b>positives</b> of a practice that is based on evidence.” Looking at a few types of articles to examine how this type of practice has influenced the standard of care is important but rarely internally valid. None of the articles specify what their biases are. Evidence based practice has gotten its reputation by examining the reasons why any and all procedures, treatments, and medicines are given. This is important for refining practice so the goal of assuring patient safety is met.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{imperfections}} in the new South Africa where I would have hoped that things would be better, but on balance I think we have basically achieved what we set out to achieve. And if I were to draw balance sheets on where South Africa stands now, I would say that the positive outweighs the negative by far. There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like how are we handling AIDS, like our role vis-à-vis Zimbabwe. But <b>the</b> <b>positives</b> – the stability in South Africa, the adherence to well-balanced economic policies, fighting inflation, doing all the right things in order to lay the basis and the foundation for sustained economic growth – are in place.|$|E
25|$|Golf follows {{traditional}} golf rules: players {{must reach}} the {{hole on the}} green in as few strokes as possible by hitting the ball with a club, while avoiding obstacles including sand traps, water hazards, trees, and deep rough grass. In the screen's top left and right corners, players are shown the wind speed/direction and an aerial layout of the course, respectively. In advance of their turn, players choose aspects of the swing, such as speed, direction, stance, club type, swing power, and the ball impact point. Swing power requires players to stop an indicator {{at the right moment}} on a vertical arrow; the ball impact point requires players to stop a zig-zagging indicator as it moves down and then up a close-up of the ball. If players allow the indicator to move {{all the way up the}} vertical arrow, they will be given another chance to time their shot; if they allow the zig-zagging indicator to reach the top, the game will automatically stop it at the very top. If players hit the top of the ball, it will go further while hitting the bottom of the ball will cause the ball to go further but have a more controlled direction. Hitting the ball on the right or left sides will cause the ball to hook in either direction. The ideal spot is the center of the ball; unlike real golf, players do not need to hit the bottom of the ball when in bunkers or deep rough. Players can also place a grid on a nearby portion of the course to aide with the aim and distance of their shots. Players can choose between five different viewing perspectives, change button configurations, and review <b>the</b> <b>positives</b> and negatives of their last shots.|$|E
25|$|Research on {{alcoholism}} within families has leaned towards exploring {{issues that}} are wrong in the community rather than potential strengths or positives. When researchers conduct research that helps communities, it can be easier for community members to identify with <b>the</b> <b>positives</b> and work towards a path of resilience. Flawed research design in adult children of alcoholics (ACOA) research showed ACOAs were psychologically damaged. Some flawed research designs include using ACOAs {{as part of the}} control group and comparing them to other ACOAs within the same study. This may have caused some limitations in the study that were not listed. When comparing ACOAs to other ACOAs, it is difficult to interpret accurate results that show certain behaviors in the group studied. Research that has been conducted more recently has used control groups with non-ACOAs to see whether the behaviors align with prior research. This research has shown that behaviors were similar between non-ACOAs and ACOAs. An 18 year-long study compared children of alcoholics (COA) to other COAs. In failing to use non-COAs as controls, we miss an opportunity to see if the negative aspects of a person are related to having an alcoholic parent, or are they just simply a fact of life. For example, in Werner’s study, he found that 30% of COAs were committing serious delinquencies. This data would have been more usable if they had viewed the percentage of those committing crimes when compared to non-ACOAs. In a study conducted in a midwestern university, researchers found that {{there was no significant difference}} between ACOA and non-ACOA students. One of the main differences was the student’s views on how they connect their past experiences with their current social-emotional functioning. Students who were ACOAs did not demonstrate issues with their perspective on their interpersonal issues any more than the non-ACA students. However, this study did show that there were other underlying problems in the family structure that may attribute to the perception of not being well adjusted in life.|$|E

500|$|Puñña and pāpa {{are close}} in meaning to kusala and akusala. Both pairs {{are used for}} {{distinguishing}} between ethically right and wrong. However, even though the negatives akusala and pāpa have almost the same meaning, there are some differences between <b>the</b> <b>positives,</b> kusala and puñña. According to P. D. Premasiri, Kusala is used to describe a more direct path to Nirvana than puñña. Damien Keown, however, believes they are merely different angles of the same concept: kusala refers to the moral status of an action, whereas puñña refers {{to the experience of}} the consequences of the action. He further points out that in the Pāli [...] (discourses) mental development (bhāvanā) practices such as meditation are also included in the path of merit. It is unlikely that in the Tipiṭaka meditation would be regarded as an indirect path or obstacle to Nirvana, and there are passages that directly relate merit to Nirvana. Sometimes a distinction is made between worldly (...) and transcendental (...) merit, in which only transcendental merit leads to liberation. The Thai scholar and monastic Phra Payutto believes that merit and kusala are both used to describe the 'cleanliness of the mind' (...) [...] But whereas merit aims for the 'beautiful and praiseworthy' (...) aspect of such cleanliness, with worldly benefits such as wealth, praise and happiness; kusala aims for the 'purity' (...) aspect of cleanliness, with enlightenment as its benefit. Phra Payutto does add that both need to be accumulated on the Buddhist path. In making this comparison, he says this only holds for worldly merit, not for transcendental merit. Collins equates transcendental merit with kusala. In the earlier Pāli texts, kusala was much more commonly used than puñña, puñña mostly being used {{in the context of the}} practice of giving.|$|E
