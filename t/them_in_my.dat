25|$|While Duke University’s {{reputation}} grew as {{a national}} educational institution, its attitudes towards black workers remained unchanged. The same year the Duke Employees Benevolent Society was established in 1965, Duke revealed a new $200 million plan to promote Duke’s status as a top national university. The funds were used to advance the renovation of new libraries, science research labs, and more modern facilities. Despite Duke University’s reputation as an institution for higher education and its growing expertise in preparing its students for the professional society, the working environments and attitudes towards black, blue-collar workers had not changed. Workers were not given health insurance, received little pay, had inconsistent and demanding schedules, often working ten to twelve days without a day off, and were treated unprofessionally. One nurse’s maid, Helen Johnstone, recalled being treated like a servant: “When I was a nurse’s maid, our second head nurse, Joan Ashley, she used to run me everywhere—uptown to get the immunizations and to put <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> refrigerator. She had me run to the library to return her books for her on time.” It was not unusual for black workers to be treated this way, especially {{as a result of}} unclear job descriptions that gave those with higher power control over the tasks assigned to black workers.|$|E

Responding to claims that her moral views were [...] "dependably predictable", Blyton commented that [...] "most of you could write down perfectly correctly all the things that I believe in and stand for– you have found <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> books, and a writer's books are always a faithful reflection of himself". Many of her books were critically assessed by teachers and librarians, deemed unfit for children to read, and removed from syllabuses and public libraries.|$|E

500|$|Armando Pérez, who co-wrote {{the tracks}} [...] "Loca" [...] and [...] "Rabiosa", talked about Shakira's {{previous}} album She Wolf, saying [...] "on the last album {{they tried to}} Americanize Shakira by giving her the big producers. Not that it was necessarily a bad thing, but it’s just not her". Talking about his collaboration with Shakira, El Cata revealed that she told him [...] "You have something that makes me move". Cata responded by telling Shakira that [...] "it was the percussion" [...] and [...] "Those sounds that you want, I have <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> studio.", {{which led to a}} recording session between the two. He appears as a featured artist on the Spanish version of [...] "Loca".|$|E
500|$|Streep's {{first feature}} film role came {{opposite}} Jane Fonda in the 1977 film Julia, {{in which she}} had a small role during a flashback sequence. Most of her scenes were edited out, but the brief time on screen horrified the actress: [...] "I had a bad wig and they took the words from the scene I shot with Jane and put <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mouth in a different scene. I thought, I've made a terrible mistake, no more movies. I hate this business". However, Streep cites Fonda as having a lasting influence on her as an actress, and has credited her as [...] "open probably more doors than I probably even know about".|$|E
500|$|Upon first listen, Kirsten Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer {{said that}} she was [...] "semi-horrified" [...] at the song, but since it was a Max Martin-produced track she [...] "gave it another chance", and commented: [...] "It’s {{definitely}} a Max Martin song. It has a good beat and cheesy, yet catchy lyrics." [...] However, Coachman said that the song should have been sung by Mark Salling (Puck) and Jenna Ushkowitz (Tina) rather than Monteith and Michele. Coachman liked the fact that this song and [...] "Get It Right" [...] fit in with the episode, and wrote, [...] "I think both songs are pretty good anthems, and hopefully they do speak to the audience. She stated, however, that she [...] "probably won’t be singing along to <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> car anytime soon". In an album review giving Glee: The Music, Vol. 5 a total of two out of five stars, Andrew Leahey of Allmusic said that the new Glee songs [...] "aren’t good enough to make much of a difference". Brett Berk of Vanity Fair gave the song four stars for its lyrics, but said that the tune [...] "sucked".|$|E

500|$|The King had a mixed {{relationship}} with Lord Melbourne. Melbourne's government mooted more ideas to introduce greater democracy, {{such as the}} devolution of powers to the Legislative Council of Lower Canada, which greatly alarmed the King, who feared it would eventually lead {{to the loss of}} the colony. At first, the King bitterly opposed these proposals. William exclaimed to Lord Gosford, Governor General-designate of Canada: [...] "Mind what you are about in Canada... mind me, my Lord, the Cabinet is not my Cabinet; they had better take care or by God, I will have them impeached." [...] When William's son Augustus FitzClarence enquired of his father whether the King would be entertaining during Ascot week, William gloomily replied, [...] "I cannot give any dinners without inviting the ministers, and I would rather see the devil than any one of <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> house." [...] Nevertheless, William approved the Cabinet's recommendations for reform. Despite his disagreements with Lord Melbourne, the King wrote warmly to congratulate the Prime Minister when he triumphed in the adultery case brought against him concerning Lady Caroline Norton—he had refused to permit Melbourne to resign when the case was first brought. The King and Prime Minister eventually found a modus vivendi; Melbourne applying tact and firmness when called for; while William realised that his First Minister was far less radical in his politics than the King had feared.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea of a}} {{new album}} came back in 2010, as {{frontman}} Dave Grohl was touring Australia with Them Crooked Vultures. Grohl decided that [...] "we should make a documentary about the recording of this new album {{and make it a}} history of the band too. Rather than just record the album in the most expensive studio with the most state-of-the-art equipment, what if Butch and I were to get back together after 20 years and dust off the tape machines and put <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> garage?" [...] Grohl later elaborated that Vig was brought in so the record could be [...] "that one album that kinda defines the band: it might not be their best album, but it's the one people identify the band with the most, like Back In Black or the Metallica Black Album. It's like you take {{all of the things that}} people consider your band's signature characteristics and just amplify them and make one simple album with that. And that's sorta what I thought we could do with Butch, because Butch has a great way of trimming all the fat and making sense of it all." [...] Grohl also used the tour with the Vultures to turn song ideas into demos, which were then brought to drummer Taylor Hawkins to be further developed. The album would also mark the return of guitarist Pat Smear as a permanent member; Smear left the Foo Fighters after the release of The Colour and the Shape, but had been part of the touring band since 2006.|$|E
2500|$|Daniel Aughey of TV Guide also {{praised the}} episode for its jokes but lack of flow, calling it [...] "one step behind".

2500|$|As a {{child the}} young Fyodor Dostoyevsky was deeply {{impressed}} by Radcliffe. In Winter Notes on Summer Impressions (1863) he writes, [...] "I {{used to spend}} the long winter hours before bed listening (for I could not yet read), agape with ecstasy and terror, as my parents read aloud {{to me from the}} novels of Ann Radcliffe. Then I would rave deliriously about <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> sleep." [...] A number of scholars have noted elements of Gothic literature in Dostoyevsky's novels, and some have attempted to show direct influence of Radcliffe's work.|$|E
2500|$|At almost 18 years old, Halep {{decided that}} her large breasts were interfering with her tennis and {{underwent}} a breast reduction surgical procedure to reduce her bust size; she later explained the decision, stating, [...] "It's the weight that troubles me. My ability to react quickly; my breasts make me uncomfortable when I play. I don’t like <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> everyday life, either. I {{would have gone}} for surgery even if I hadn’t been a sportswoman." [...] She also experienced back pain. After the surgery, she moved up constantly in the world rankings, reaching world No. 2 in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{significantly}} {{differs from}} all other adaptations of Ramayana in the characterisation of the central characters, including Rama and Lakshmana. The characters are humanised, contrary to the way divine characters from Indian mythology are usually depicted in visual media. Rama has a pot belly, while Lakshmana has pockmarks on his face. In an interview, Aravindan stated, [...] "Our sculptures are large in size and exude strength and vitality, which is absent in murals. The Rama of Kanchana Sita exudes the strength and vitality of our sculptures. He {{is not just a}} plain frontal image. The wandering tribals we encounter here and there with their medicines also share this quality. I enquired and found that these people are settled in villages near the Godavari River. Apart from this they also believe that they belong to the same race. That is why I cast two of <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> film." ...|$|E

2500|$|.....the Chancellor of the Exchequer shall boldly uphold {{economy in}} detail; {{and it is}} the mark ... of ... a chicken-hearted Chancellor of the Exchequer, when he shrinks from {{upholding}} economy in detail, when, because {{it is a question of}} only £2,000 or £3,000, he says that is no matter. He is ridiculed, no doubt, for what is called saving candle-ends and cheese-parings. No Chancellor of the Exchequer is worth his salt who is not ready to save what are meant by candle-ends and cheese-parings in the cause of his country. No Chancellor of the Exchequer is worth his salt who makes his own popularity either his first consideration, or any consideration at all, in administrating the public purse. You would not like to have a housekeeper or steward who made her or his popularity with the tradesmen the measure of the payments that were to be delivered to <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>my</b> opinion the Chancellor of the Exchequer is the trusted and confidential steward of the public. He is under a sacred obligation with regard to all that he consents to spend.... I am bound to say hardly ever in the six years that Sir Stafford Northcote has been in office have I heard him speak a resolute word on behalf of economy.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Hagen {{delivered}} {{a speech at}} a convention of the independent Christian organisation Levende Ord, where he stated that [...] "we Christians are very much concerned with children. Jesus said, let the small children come to me. I can't understand that Muhammad could have said the same. In the case {{that he could have}} said the same, it would have been: Let the small children come to me, so that I can exploit <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> struggle to Islamify the world." [...] He also said that if Israel lost the fight in the Middle East, Europe would [...] "bow under to Islam," [...] if Muslim fundamentalists get it as they want. [...] "They have, {{in the same manner as}} Hitler, long ago made it clear that the long-term plan is to Islamify the world. They have come a long way, they have pierced deep into Africa, and have come a long way into Europe – and then we have to fight back." [...] He was because of the speech criticised by politicians and religious leaders within Norway. Some days later, the ambassadors of Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt and Morocco, and chargé d'affaires of Tunisia made an unusually strong attack on Hagen in a letter in the newspaper Aftenposten.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1829, Charles X {{decided to}} show his {{authority}} over the unruly Chamber of Deputies, and named a fervent royalist, Jules de Polignac as his new prime minister. On 19 March 1830, he raised the temperature, warning that if the deputies put obstacles in his path, he would [...] "find the force to overcome <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> resolution to maintain the public peace, with the full confidence of the French and the love they have also shown toward their King." [...] He also launched an overseas expedition for the conquest of Algeria, which he was certain would increase his popularity at home, and called for new elections, which he was certain he would win. The French flag was hoisted over Algiers on 5 July 1830, and new elections were held from 13 to 19 July. The elections were {{a disaster for the}} King; the opposition won 270 seats, against 145 supporters of the King. The opponents were, for the most part, not republicans; they simply wanted a constitutional monarchy. The King responded, however, on 25 July with new decrees dissolving the Chamber of Deputies, changing the election laws, and putting restrictions on the press. The King, confident in his popularity, neglected to put the army on alert or to bring in soldiers to maintain order.|$|E

2500|$|Fang Xuanling {{had served}} Your Imperial Majesty {{for a long}} time. [...] He is careful, {{and all of his}} {{wonderful}} strategies and secret plans were not revealed to anyone. [...] Unless there is a particularly good reason, I hope that you will not abandon him. [...] As to my Zhangsun clan, many of them enjoy high salaries and high positions on account of our marriage, not because of their great virtues, and therefore they can crumble easily. [...] In order to preserve the Zhangsuns, I hope that you will not put them in powerful positions, and that they would be satisfied with seeing you at imperial gatherings the first and 15th day of each month. [...] During my lifetime, I made no contributions to the people, and I should not harm <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> death. [...] I hope that you will not build a tomb to cause the people to labor and the empire to waste resources. [...] Make a hill my tomb, and only use brick or wooden implements in the tomb. [...] I hope that Your Imperial Majesty will continue to be close to honest men and stay away from those lacking virtues; that you will accept faithful words and reject wicked flattery; that you will decrease labor and stop hunting. [...] Even as I go into the underworld, if these things happen, I will have no regrets. [...] It is not necessary to summon the sons and daughters back here; if I see them mourn and cry, I will only be saddened.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, {{near the}} height of the dot com boom, The New York Times {{approached}} Krugman to write a bi-weekly column on [...] "the vagaries of business and economics in an age of prosperity." [...] His first columns in 2000 addressed business and economic issues, but as the 2000 US presidential campaign progressed, Krugman increasingly focused on George W. Bush's policy proposals. According to Krugman, this was partly due to [...] "the silence of the media – those 'liberal media' conservatives complain about..." [...] Krugman accused Bush of repeatedly misrepresenting his proposals, and criticized the proposals themselves. After Bush's election, and his perseverance with his proposed tax cut {{in the midst of the}} slump (which Krugman argued would do little to help the economy but substantially raise the fiscal deficit), Krugman's columns grew angrier and more focused on the administration. As Alan Blinder put it in 2002, [...] "There's been a kind of missionary quality to his writing since then ... He's trying to stop something now, using the power of the pen." [...] Partly as a result, Krugman's twice-weekly column on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times has made him, according to Nicholas Confessore, [...] "the most important political columnist in America... he is almost alone in analyzing the most important story in politics in recent years – the seamless melding of corporate, class, and political party interests at which the Bush administration excels." [...] In an interview in late 2009, Krugman said his missionary zeal had changed in the post-Bush era and he described the Obama administration as [...] "good guys but not as forceful as I'd like...When I argue with <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> column this is a serious discussion. We really are in effect speaking across the transom here." [...] Krugman says he's more effective at driving change outside the administration than inside it, [...] "now, I'm trying to make this progressive moment in American history a success. So that's where I'm pushing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Executive Producer Louise Berridge {{decided to}} {{reintroduce}} the character 8 {{years after she}} had last appeared. Auditions were held to cast the role to a professional actor; however, auditionees were not informed which character they were auditioning for. The first audition was a group workshop of 30 auditionees, who were asked to perform improvisations. After whittling down potential actors from 500 to 4, {{the second stage of}} the audition process was an interview with EastEnders Casting Director. The auditionees were asked to perform a monologue {{in front of a camera}} and do a screen test with one of the actors already in the show, Christopher Parker, who played Spencer Moon. 17-year-old actress Scarlett Johnson was cast: [...] "At the second audition they gave me a monologue to read, but they'd been really careful about it. They hadn't said what the character's name was, they didn't give away anything in the monologue that might tell me who I was auditioning for. So I didn't know until I got the part who I was going to be playing--I'd been guessing for ages!" [...] Asked how she felt when she knew she was playing Vicki Fowler, a character linked to the show's early history who is the daughter of 2 prominent original characters, Johnson said: [...] "I felt very honoured, but it was quite scary. I knew there'd be a lot of people out there with expectations of what she'd be like. But it's good fun actually. It means you don't have to introduce yourself to everyone. You can really play with that [...] My family are EastEnders addicts, we've watched it our whole lives. I remember the first Vicki, I remember Michelle and I definitely remember Dirty Den! My knowledge of the show really helped a lot, because I didn't have to do any research into the character. When I joined the show, I felt like I was meeting the actors for a second time. I'd already met <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> home on TV, then I had to actually meet them in real life!" [...] The character made her reappearance in January 2003, turning up unexpectedly at her grandmother Pauline's (Wendy Richard) house.|$|E
