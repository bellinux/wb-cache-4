40|$|Changing {{orchard sprayer}} {{technology}} and rising pesticide costs to fruit growers raise {{the need to}} analyze the profitability of alternative sprayer investments. This study analyzes investments in four orchard sprayers for use in Michigan apple production: an air blast sprayer, a <b>tower</b> <b>boom</b> sprayer, a <b>tower</b> <b>boom</b> sprayer equipped with electronic sensors that activate spray nozzles when foliage is detected, and an air curtain sprayer that targets spray {{with a layer of}} forced air. Assuming equal pest control efficacy, the study calculates the annualized net present cost per acre of owning and operating each sprayer for ten years using a baseline discount rate of 10 percent over 200 acres of semi-dwarf apple trees. The analysis found the annualized net present cost per acre, from least to greatest, to be $ 287 for the air curtain sprayer, $ 312 for the tower sprayer with electronic sensors, $ 345 for the plain tower sprayer, and $ 391 for the conventional air blast sprayer. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the ranking of these cost results was sensitive to farm size, but not to percentage of funds borrowed, discount rate, loan interest rate, or pesticide costs within the ranges investigated. The air curtain sprayer was lowest cost for orchards of 25 acres or more; the conventional air blast sprayer was lowest cost for 10 -acre orchards. Crop Production/Industries,...|$|E

50|$|Especially {{in medieval}} times, {{the end of}} a chain could be {{attached}} to a chain <b>tower</b> or <b>boom</b> <b>tower.</b> This allowed safe raising or lowering of the chain, as they were often heavily fortified. By raising or lowering a chain or boom, access could be selectively granted rather than simply rendering the stretch of water completely inaccessible. The raising and lowering could be accomplished by a windlass mechanism or a capstan.|$|R
50|$|A {{heightened}} {{phase of}} prosperity was entered {{when the great}} wealth of the Day Dawn Reef was discovered in 1878. It was {{to become one of}} the highest producers of gold on the Charters Towers field. Charters <b>Towers</b> <b>boomed</b> throughout the 1880s, overshadowing all other mining centres in North Queensland. Increased speculation was triggered by the floating of companies on the London stock market from 1886 following a display of Charters Towers Gold at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in London in 1885 and changes to investment law. British investors poured wealth into Charters Towers during this period providing the capital which gave rise to the substantial nature of the city and the continued large scale mining.|$|R

The lights of Victoria saw him too, and Sloane Square, and the {{railings}} of the park. And Comrade Ossipon once more found himself on a bridge. The river, a sinister marvel of still shadows and flowing gleams mingling below in a black silence, arrested his attention. He stood looking over the parapet for a long time.

5000|$|Charters <b>Towers</b> <b>boomed</b> {{throughout}} the 1880s, overshadowing all other mining centres in North Queensland. A display of Charters Towers Gold in the Queensland Court at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in London in 1886 in turn {{led to an}} influx of capital from English speculators, and in 1889 the famous Brilliant Reef, the richest on the field, was discovered. During this time many of the 1870s timber commercial buildings on Mosman and Gill Streets were rebuilt in brick. Charters Towers continued to prosper {{throughout the}} depressed economy of the 1890s with a peak production of 319,572 ounces of gold in 1899, and a population of around 26,500 the same year. At {{the turn of the}} century Charters Towers, with its multi-cultural population, was known colloquially as [...] "the World".|$|R
50|$|In 1885, Thomas Craven, a Trustee for the {{association}} purchased the {{land on which}} the Londoners' Association built their clubhouse. In the late 1880s and 1890s, Charters <b>Towers</b> <b>boomed</b> and handsome public buildings replaced the modest structures of the early township. In 1900 {{the association}} applied for a club liquor licence for their new clubhouse and were registered as the Londoners' Club. The premises were opened in May 1900 and provided a bar plus comfortable and well-lit rooms for billiards and card playing. Card games were subject to severe restrictions in hotels and the club {{is said to have}} offered all night gaming facilities. Card tables were installed with drawers to hold money, chips and, it was rumoured, gold dust and even pistols. Monthly smoke concerts were held, informal affairs where the members themselves provided the entertainment.|$|R

50|$|As well {{as being}} Hilton's first foray into Glasgow (it later took over the prestigious Stakis Grosvenor in the city's West End, and a third hotel {{was added to the}} {{portfolio}} in Finnieston), the hotel was notable for being the first high-rise building over 20 storeys to be constructed in Glasgow since its <b>tower</b> block building <b>boom</b> of the 1960s and early 1970s. The hotel has the largest banqueting hall in the city.|$|R
2500|$|How {{quickly the}} towers were built is controversial. Poyntz Wright {{estimates}} {{one or two}} years. John H. Harvey believes a construction rate of [...] per year, allowing for gradual settlement, is more in accord with known medieval tower construction rates. The towers were commissioned by wealthy benefactors and parishes as a testament to their faith, {{as well as a}} highly visible sign of wealth and status. Nikolaus Pevsner notes {{that at the end of}} the 14th century, Somerset was producing a quarter of the wool products made in England and this was one of the sources of wealth that produced the Somerset <b>towers.</b> The <b>boom</b> in wool led to a comparable, though architecturally rather different, wave of equally extravagant parish churches in 15th century Suffolk. An additional source of support for some of the Somerset churches would have been close ties to nearby monasteries in Muchelney, Athelney, Glastonbury and Bath.|$|R
5|$|A large {{broadcasting}} {{tower was}} {{needed in the}} Kant≈ç region after NHK, Japan's public broadcasting station, began television broadcasting in 1953. Private broadcasting companies began operating {{in the months following}} the construction of NHK's own transmission <b>tower.</b> This communications <b>boom</b> led the Japanese government to believe that transmission towers would soon be built all over Tokyo, eventually overrunning the city. The proposed solution was the construction of one large tower capable of transmitting to the entire region. Furthermore, because of the country's postwar boom in the 1950s, Japan was searching for a monument to symbolize its ascendancy as a global economic powerhouse.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve the layout and size {{optimization}} of the web members of <b>tower</b> crane <b>boom,</b> a truss topology and cross section size optimization method based on continuum is proposed considering three typical working conditions. Firstly, the optimization model is established by replacing web members with web plates. And the web plates are divided into several sub-domains so that periodic soft kill option (SKO) method {{can be carried out}} for topology optimization of the slender boom. After getting the optimized topology of web plates, the optimized layout of web members is formed through extracting the principal stress distribution. Finally, using the web member radius as design variable, the boom compliance as objective and the material volume of the boom as constraint, the cross section size optimization mathematical model is established. The size optimization criterion is deduced from the mathematical model by Lagrange multiplier method and Kuhn-Tucker condition. By comparing the original boom with the optimal boom, it is identified that this optimization method can effectively lighten the boom and improve its performance...|$|R
5000|$|Alberta then sailed out of Cowes, {{escorted by}} a {{flotilla}} of eight destroyers, and leading the other royal yachts, the Victoria and Albert, HMY Osborne and the German yacht Hohenzollern. As they {{passed by the}} anchored warships, their crews fired salutes, bands played funeral marches, the officers saluted and the marine guards presented arms. One of the spectators, Randall Davidson, the Bishop of Winchester, remarked the calm sea, the slow motion of the vessels, which seemed to glide without visible propelling power, the little 'Alberta' going first through the broad avenue of <b>towering</b> battle-ships <b>booming</b> out their salutes, the enormous mass of perfectly silent black-clothed crowds covering Southsea Common and the beach. I do not envy the man who could pass through such a scene dry-eyed. It took an hour for the Alberta to cross the Solent, arriving to large silent crowds of dignitaries and spectators in the late afternoon. A battery of guns from the local garrison announced the arrival, and a marine band struck up aboard [...] as the Alberta tied up at the Clarence Yard. She spent the night here, with the Queen's coffin aboard under a continuous guard of honour.|$|R
500|$|There are fragmentary {{historical}} {{references to}} an earlier tower in the area, responsible for collecting tolls and acting as a prison, but it is unclear if this was on the same site as the Cow Tower, or refers to a different tower in the area. The Cow Tower {{was one of several}} fortifications along this stretch of the river, with the gatehouse of Bishop Bridge lying just to the south, followed by two <b>boom</b> <b>towers</b> that controlled access to the waterway a further [...] down-river, and with another tower positioned [...] up-river to the north. Although the Cow Tower was not directly part of the city walls, a protective timber palisade linked the tower with the line of the city wall to the north-west, and ran south to meet Bishop Bridge.|$|R
40|$|At cable winding today {{one uses}} one portal, one caterpillar, one {{spooling}} <b>boom</b> and one <b>tower</b> {{and the same}} kind of set of equipment for unwinding. This kind of solution is both expensive and unpractical when one of the components of unwinding/winding is stationary for a long time without being used. To save unnecessary expenditure and maintenance it would have been practical to only use one set of caterpillar, <b>tower,</b> spooling <b>boom</b> and portal that later on can be rotated around the turntable when exporting the cable. The project that this work includes is to bring a concept that excludes two sets and thus provides the system with a rotatable spooling system. To get as much information about the product and of the manufacturing as possible several interviews has been done of the forging shop Ronneby Svets & Smide and also their fitters. At the concept generation several proposals was developed and to go further with only one of them a QFD and a SWOT analysis was made to get the best concept. Verification of solid mechanics on the construction with FEM-analysis has been implemented on beams, tubes and tube constructions. The project comprises constructing of details and drawings for structure of the concept and also commitment of assembly, maintenance, ergonomics and shipping. At the assembly has bolted joints been used on most attachments for fast assembling on site instead of welds. For commitment of maintenance it is thought that one should easily access for control and tighten afterwards of example the slewing ring. At the ergonomics the idea is put for example to accessing the workspace or maintenance areas in form of a ladder or a staircase. The shipping has played a major role for the construction parts and has then been divided for easiest and most practical way to be transported smoothly...|$|R
50|$|The Wensum {{continues}} through {{or close to}} the villages of Guist, North Elmham, Worthing, Swanton Morley, Lyng, Lenwade and Taverham before entering the City of Norwich from the north-west via Drayton, Costessey and Hellesdon. At New Mills Yard, a former waterworks, the river becomes tidal and navigable by boat. Flowing through the city, the river forms a broad arc which would have influenced {{the site of the}} settlement for defensive reasons; remnants of <b>boom</b> <b>towers</b> can be seen near Wensum Park and Carrow Hill which formed part of the city wall and a large defensive tower can be seen on the bank near Barrack Street, called Cow Tower. This dates to the 12th century and was also used for collecting tolls. Evidence of the river's historical use as a means of transport for goods and trade from the continent is still visible: mills, quays and industrial remnants can be found near the station and along King Street, and a slipway at Pulls Ferry marks the start of a canal originally used to transport stone from Caen in Normandy, in the 13th Century, to build Norwich Cathedral. This site was also a public house and used as a River Ferry until the 1950s.|$|R

The tower's height was eventually determined by the distance the TV stations needed to transmit throughout the Kant≈ç region, a distance of about 150 km. Tach≈´ Nait≈ç, renowned designer of tall buildings in Japan, was chosen to design the newly proposed tower. Looking to the Western world for inspiration, Nait≈ç based his design on the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. With the help of engineering company Nikken Sekkei Ltd., Nait≈ç claimed his design could withstand earthquakes with twice the intensity of the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake or typhoons with wind speeds of up to 220 km/h.|$|R
