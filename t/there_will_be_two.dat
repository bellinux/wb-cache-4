The opening of that project would divert some Long Island Rail Road trains to Grand Central Terminal, {{therefore}} opening up slots at Penn Station for Metro-North service.

25|$|Each {{match in}} the {{knockout}} stage must conclude in a victory. If, after eighty minutes of normal play, a match {{results in a}} draw, further play is made to determine an outright winner. Initially, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>two</b> periods of extra time, 10 minutes each way; {{if there is no}} winner after this, then play proceeds to a single 10-minute period of 'sudden death' play. If the contest is unresolved after a total 110 minutes of open play, the winner will be determined by a placekicking competition.|$|E
25|$|In October 2016, ICC started {{contemplating a}} {{different}} kind of Two-Tier system for Test match cricket. This structure will be similar to Baseball-style structure, where <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>two</b> conferences of six teams each. Each team will play against all teams in their conference over a period of two years, with a Test Championship play-off between the toppers of both conferences {{at the end of the}} defined period. This structure will remove the non-equality that was a drawback of the initially proposed Two-tier system.|$|E
25|$|Two bus {{rapid transit}} {{projects}} have been approved along the Geary Boulevard and Van Ness Avenue corridors, costing $240 to $270 million and $126 million respectively. For Van Ness BRT, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>two</b> dedicated bus lanes in the median between Lombard Street and Mission Street. Geary BRT will have dedicated median lanes in the Richmond District area, then curbside bus lanes east to Market Street. Both corridors will include transit signal priority, all-door boarding, new low-floor buses, and improved stations. Construction will begin on Van Ness BRT on October 24, 2016, with completion by 2018. Geary BRT is projected to begin construction in 2017 and also be in service by 2018.|$|E

25|$|Before {{a battle}} begins, the player usually has {{the choice to}} retreat, giving them time to prepare. For every battle, the player may choose only three combatants out of a {{possible}} five, and a positioning scheme for them. The player can either choose the Attack or Magic formation. The Attack formation allows Attack based moves a shorter recharge time, and <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>two</b> characters in the front row, and a single character in the back row. In Magic formation, Magic users have a shorter recharge time and positioning is reversed. Following that decision the player must choose the items to bring. Only sixteen items can be held at any time, and there are no methods of storage. The player may only bring four of those sixteen items into battle for all three characters to use. However, for every item, each character has a different attack; where, with a staff, Cierra might do great damage with a magical attack, Fia would heal an ally.|$|E
500|$|<b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>two</b> {{variations}} of this future warming feedback: the [...] "moist greenhouse" [...] where water vapor dominates the troposphere while water vapor starts to accumulate {{in the stratosphere}} (if the oceans evaporate very quickly), and the [...] "runaway greenhouse" [...] where water vapor becomes a dominant component of the atmosphere (if the oceans evaporate too slowly). The Earth will undergo rapid warming that could send its surface temperature to over 900°C (1,650°F) as the atmosphere will be totally overwhelmed by water vapor, causing its entire surface to melt and killing all life, perhaps in about three billion years. In this ocean-free era, there {{will continue to be}} surface reservoirs as water is steadily released from the deep crust and mantle, where it is estimated there is an amount of water equivalent to several times that currently present in the Earth's oceans. Some water may be retained at the poles and there may be occasional rainstorms, {{but for the most part}} the planet would be a dry desert with large dunefields covering its equator, and a few salt flats on what was once the ocean floor, similar to the ones in the Atacama Desert in Chile.|$|E
500|$|Evelyn Waugh's {{professional}} and private circumstances, {{in the years}} after the Second World War, prefigured those of his fictional counterpart Pinfold. Before the war he had established himself as a writer, mainly of light satirical fiction. His wartime experiences, including service in the Royal Marines and the Royal Horse Guards, changed his personal and literary outlook, and put him into what his biographer David Wykes describes as [...] "a mood of introspection... that endured {{to the end of his}} career". Despite occasional reversions to his former style, in general Waugh's post-war fiction aspired to a more serious purpose. In an essay published in Life magazine in April 1946, he wrote: [...] "In my future books <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>two</b> things to make them unpopular: a preoccupation with style and the attempt to represent man more fully, which, to me, means only one thing, man in his relation to God." [...] The commercial success of Brideshead Revisited, published in 1945, provided Waugh with the financial means to pursue his writing career in a leisurely fashion. He worked intermittently on his novel Helena for five years, while completing shorter projects and carrying out much unpaid work, particularly for Catholic organisations. In a marked change from his pre-war life, he ceased to socialise and became increasingly concerned to protect his privacy. To this end he adopted an overtly hostile persona as a defence mechanism, to repel the outside world.|$|E

500|$|The new {{magazine}} was titled Venture Science Fiction, {{and the first}} issue was dated January 1957. Mills was managing editor of F throughout Ventures first run; he became editor of F shortly after Venture ceased publishing in July 1958. The editorial philosophy was laid out by Ferman in the inaugural issue: [...] "strong stories of action and adventure... <b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>two</b> prime requisites for Venture stories: In the first place, each must be a well-told story, with a beginning, middle and end; in the second place, each must be a strong story—a story with pace, power and excitement." [...] Ferman hoped {{to take advantage of}} a gap in the science fiction magazine market opened up by the demise of Planet Stories, one of the last sf pulps, which had ceased publication in late 1955. [...] Planet Stories had focused on adventure stories, as opposed to the realistic style becoming more popular in science fiction in the 1950s, and Ferman hoped to combine the virtues of the melodramatic pulp fiction style with the literary values that were key to Fs success. [...] Ventures bias towards action-oriented adventure led to stories with relatively more sex and violence than those in competing magazines, and sf historian Mike Ashley has commented that it was perhaps five or ten years ahead of its time. [...] One story, [...] "The Girl Had Guts", by Theodore Sturgeon, involved an alien virus that caused its victims to vomit up their intestines; Ashley records a reviewer saying that the story made him physically ill.|$|E
500|$|The word maser {{derives from}} the acronym MASER, which stands for [...] "Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation". The maser is a {{predecessor}} to lasers, which operate at optical wavelengths, and is named by the replacement of [...] "microwave" [...] with [...] "light". Given a system of atoms or molecules, each with different energy states, an atom or molecule may absorb a photon and move to a higher energy level, or the photon may stimulate emission of another photon of the same energy and cause a transition to a lower energy level. Producing a maser requires population inversion, which is when a system has more members in a higher energy level relative to a lower energy level. In such a situation, more photons will be produced by stimulated emission than will be absorbed. Such a system is not in thermal equilibrium, and as such requires special conditions to occur. Specifically, it must have some energy source that can pump the atoms or molecules to the excited state. Once population inversion occurs, a photon with a photon energy corresponding to the energy difference between two states can then produce stimulated emission of another photon of the same energy. The atom or molecule will drop to the lower energy level, and <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>two</b> photons of the same energy, where before there was only one. The repetition {{of this process is}} what leads to amplification, and since all of the photons are the same energy, the light produced is monochromatic.|$|E
