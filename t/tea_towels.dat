He was unique in having his own line of merchandise, including plushes, <b>tea</b> <b>towels,</b> art prints, art paw prints and two real ales – Chalky's Bite and Chalky's Bark, which won gold in the Quality Drink Awards 2009. Chalky was given a BBC obituary when he died in 2007.|$|E

2500|$|Prince William and Kate Middleton {{personally}} approved {{an official}} range of china (including handmade plates, cups, and pill boxes) {{to be made}} for the Royal Collection and sold as souvenirs from December 2010 on. The items are decorated with the intertwined initials of the couple under the prince's coronet and include the wording [...] "To celebrate the marriage of Prince William of Wales and Catherine Middleton 29 April 2011." [...] The Lord Chamberlain's office approved a longer list of memorabilia, including official mugs, plates, biscuit tins, and porcelain pill pots. The document also clarified the use of William's coat of arms and pictures of the couple on such items. Initially, the Palace refused to sanction official <b>tea</b> <b>towels,</b> which, along with aprons, T-shirts and cushions, were deemed, [...] "in poor taste". However, the restriction on <b>tea</b> <b>towels,</b> though not the other items, was later reversed. Sales of merchandising were expected to reach £44million.|$|E

50|$|Traditional Hungarian, Austrian, and Czech strudel pastry is {{different}} from strudels elsewhere, which are often made from puff pastry. The traditional strudel pastry dough is very elastic. It is made from flour with a high gluten content, water, oil and salt, with no sugar added. The dough is worked vigorously, rested, and then rolled out and stretched by hand very thinly {{with the help of}} a clean linen <b>tea</b> <b>towel</b> or kitchen paper. Purists say that it should be so thin that you can read a newspaper through it. A legend has it that the Austrian Emperor's perfectionist cook decreed that it should be possible to read a love letter through it. The thin dough is laid out on a <b>tea</b> <b>towel,</b> and the filling is spread on it. The dough with the filling on top is rolled up carefully with the help of the <b>tea</b> <b>towel</b> and baked in the oven.|$|R

40|$|The {{exhibition}} {{draws the}} viewers {{attention to the}} idea that a practical and necessary item can also be a work of art, a form of advertising, an instructional guide, and, by default, a celebration of all things British. The <b>tea</b> <b>towel</b> collection is not only an anthropological exploration of British life and culture, it also strongly reflects the technological changes in textile printing methods in the UK. The changes in design from the 50 s through to the 80 s as well as the development of digital technologies has meant this everyday object can be more than just a <b>tea</b> <b>towel,</b> it can effectively reflect class and cultural aspirations...|$|R

Holmes was apologetic and regretful about using the phrase, but later argued there was a fine line between humour and offense. The phrase featured on a commemorative <b>tea</b> <b>towel,</b> and fellow broadcaster John Hawkesby remembered Holmes as a [...] "cheeky little whitey" [...] at his funeral in 2013.|$|R

This is, she argues, what feminist postmod-ern ethical praxis looks like. But first, a story. I come home one Friday in spring with a box. My partner is out; the girls have eaten supper and are almost done washing up.

5|$|After Mary's death, Paul and Michael {{were sent}} to live with Jim's brother Joe, and his wife Joan, for two months, so as to let their father grieve in private. Jim {{depended}} heavily on his sisters, Jin and Millie, to help around the house. Jim later {{took part in the}} running of the household, as Cynthia Lennon remembered that when she and John Lennon used to visit Forthlin Road, Jim would often answer the door with his sleeves rolled up, a <b>tea</b> <b>towel</b> in his hand and an apron tied around his waist. When Paul later played at The Cavern during lunchtimes, Jim would drop off food there that Paul would later put in the oven at Forthlin Road. Ruth remembered that Jim was funny and musical with her, but also strict when she was young, and was insistent that she learned good table manners and etiquette when speaking to people.|$|R
30|$|Within SFL, {{very little}} {{work has been}} done on what {{constitutes}} a word and it is often the case, as it is generally in linguistics, that the orthographic word is the default but this is problematic for a variety of reasons. The most important reason is because English orthography has not been consistent (into but out of, corkscrew but <b>tea</b> <b>towel,</b> etc.). Indeed, the very nature of what is a word cannot be taken for granted (see Wray 2014). The focus on the orthographic word is a real danger to studies of lexis and as corpus linguistics increases in popularity, it becomes even more important to challenge the assumptions surrounding the identification of lexical items. The status of the lexeme and indeed lexical representation within the theory is critically important, not just for the theory itself but for the areas it ventures into including applications and dialogue with other theories of language.|$|R

In 1998 she sold her dress in a charity auction to Hard Rock Cafe in Las Vegas for a record £41,320, giving Halliwell the Guinness World Record for the most expensive piece of pop star clothing ever sold.
