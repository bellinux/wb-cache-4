25|$|In 1886, Flower's brother {{opened a}} {{sanatorium}} in Boston and moved there with him. At this time, Flower {{returned to the}} world of publishing, launching a new literary magazine called <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>Spectator.</b> This venture proved successful, achieving a circulation of more than 10,000 copies within three years. In December 1889, Flower merged this publication into a new social reform magazine he launched called The Arena.|$|E
25|$|In April 1996, Lewinsky's {{superiors}} relocated {{her job to}} the Pentagon, {{because they}} {{felt that she was}} spending too much time around Clinton. According to his autobiography, then-United Nations Ambassador Bill Richardson was asked by the White House in 1997 to interview Lewinsky for a job on his staff at the UN. Richardson did so, and offered her a position, which she declined. <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>Spectator</b> alleged that Richardson knew more about the Lewinsky affair than he declared to the grand jury.|$|E
25|$|Another British philosopher, Roger Scruton, is a {{self-described}} traditionalist conservative.

50|$|In September 2010, ABC News’ Brian Ross {{quoted a}} former MEP {{employee}} who alleged in a whistleblower lawsuit {{that the company}} had sent unqualified linguists to Afghanistan two years earlier. Disparate commentators criticized ABC’s coverage of the story. The Huffington Post’s David Isenberg pointed out Ross’s use of “weak, secondary sources,” and the former employee’s financial motives in bringing <b>the</b> case. <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>Spectator’s</b> Jed Babbin said Ross had “cobbled together information from irrelevant or financially interested sources.” Two weeks after the original report aired, the network published a follow-up on its website when U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema dismissed the case against MEP without prejudice.|$|R

25|$|On April 6, 2004, he was {{appointed}} dean of the Pepperdine University School of Law. He originally accepted a position at Pepperdine as the first dean of the newly created School of Public Policy in 1996; however, he withdrew from the appointment in 1998, several months after the Lewinsky controversy erupted. Critics charged {{that there was a}} conflict of interest due to substantial donations to Pepperdine from billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife, a Clinton critic who funded many media outlets attacking the president. (Scaife's money, however, supported the Foster-was-murdered theory, according to CNN, and Scaife defunded <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>Spectator</b> after it endorsed Starr's conclusion of suicide and mocked a Scaife-aided book.) In 2004, some five years after President Clinton's impeachment, Starr was again offered a Pepperdine position at the School of Law and this time accepted it.|$|E
500|$|During former United States President Bill Clinton's 1992 {{campaign}} for the American presidency, Daniel Wattenberg's August 1992 <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>Spectator</b> article [...] "The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock", and some twenty other articles in major publications drew comparisons between his wife and Lady Macbeth, questioning Hillary Clinton's ideological and ethical record in comparison to Shakespeare's famous character and suggesting parallels.|$|E
500|$|In December of {{the same}} year, {{allegations}} by Arkansas state troopers Larry Patterson and Roger Perry were first reported by David Brock in <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>Spectator.</b> In the affair later known as [...] "Troopergate", the officers alleged that they arranged sexual liaisons for Clinton {{back when he was}} governor of Arkansas. The story mentioned a woman named Paula, a reference to Paula Jones. Brock later apologized to Clinton, saying the article was politically motivated [...] "bad journalism", and that [...] "the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives".|$|E
50|$|In 1907, {{after one}} year as an {{assistant}} coach, King was made {{head coach of the}} Yale Boxing team during an era when boxing was one of <b>the</b> most popular <b>American</b> <b>spectator</b> sports.

5000|$|The {{dramatic}} {{finish of}} the 1908 Olympic marathon led to worldwide marathon fever.

50|$|The tasting {{methodology}} of different outlets varies; for example, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> publication, Wine <b>Spectator,</b> has editors taste wines blind in flights of similar vintage and variety. Other outlets taste in similar fashion. Different critics will use different descriptive scales, {{with the major}} US critics using a 50-100 point scale, and most newspapers using a 5-star scale.|$|R
500|$|Not all {{investigations}} were by governmental bodies. [...] The magazine <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>Spectator,</b> {{which had}} a well-established animus towards the First Couple, focused on the Travelgate story as one of many [...] Clinton-related matters it thought scandalous, describing it as [...] "a story about influence-peddling and sleazy deal-making... in the Clinton White House". Spectator publisher R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr. would claim that the magazine's early Travelgate stories provided useful material to the congressional investigations. [...] In general, Clinton administration controversies such as Travelgate allowed opinion magazines and political debate television shows to attract subscribers and viewers.|$|E
500|$|Also in 2013, {{a brother}} and sister in Oneida, New York, stated that they were Native American (Mohawk) and ardent Redskins fans. Three Virginia Indian leaders {{say they are not}} {{offended}} by the name Redskins but are more concerned about other issues such as the lack of Federal recognition for any Virginia tribe. Robert [...] "Two Eagles" [...] Green, retired chief of the Fredericksburg area Patawomeck Tribe, stated on a radio talk show he would be offended if the team changed its name. In an article in <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>Spectator,</b> the current chief of the Patawomeck Tribe, John Lightner, said that while he was not offended by the current name, he would support changing the team to the Washington Potomacs.|$|E
500|$|The book's {{environmental}} {{focus was}} also criticized by some. Christopher Orlet of <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>Spectator</b> wrote {{that it is}} [...] "a prime example of the wrongheaded, extremist views of the Greens". Braile agrees that the book could be [...] "an environmentalist's nightmare, possibly fueling the cheap shots taken at the green movement ... by critics who say environmentalists care more about nature than people". Environmentalist Alex Steffen found the book presents nothing new, but that using the sudden and clean disappearance of humans provides a unique framework, although extremely unlikely and insensitive. Two critics who call the book a [...] "Jeremiad" [...] ultimately gave it a positive review. The Guardian says [...] "we learn {{during the course of}} this book, to feel good about the disappearance of humanity from the Earth".|$|E

5000|$|In 2000, Joy gained notoriety {{with the}} {{publication}} of his article in Wired Magazine, [...] "Why the future doesn't need us", in which he declared, in what some have described as a [...] "neo-Luddite" [...] position, that he was convinced that growing advances in genetic engineering and nanotechnology would bring risks to humanity. He argued that intelligent robots would replace humanity, at the very least in intellectual and social dominance, in the relatively near future. He advocates a position of relinquishment of GNR (genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics) technologies, rather than going into an arms race between negative uses of the technology and defense against those negative uses (good nano-machines patrolling and defending against Grey Goo [...] "bad" [...] nano-machines). This stance of broad relinquishment was criticized by technologists such as technological-singularity thinker Ray Kurzweil, who instead advocates fine-grained relinquishment and ethical guidelines. Joy was also criticized by <b>the</b> conservative <b>American</b> <b>Spectator,</b> which characterized Joy's essay as a (possibly unwitting) rationale for statism.|$|R
500|$|In 1999, The New York Times {{reported}} that Jesse Ventura first approached Trump {{about a possible}} 2000 presidential run while both were in attendance at a wrestling event in Atlantic City. [...] Trump's ambitions may have spawned earlier. The America We Deserve co-writer Dave Shiflett said Trump first thought about running in late 1998, {{when he looked at}} his political advantages in money and name recognition, and concluded that he was [...] "at least as competent" [...] as then President Bill Clinton. According to Shiflett, this prompted Trump to ask top aide Roger Stone to find the [...] "most eminent hack writer in America" [...] to put Trump's political ideas into a book. [...] Stone reached out to Shiflett, a contributor to <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>Spectator.</b> In spring 1999, Shiflett met with Trump about the project that would later become The America We Deserve. [...] During the initial meeting, Shiflett claims Trump raised concerns about a suitcase bomb destroying Manhattan.|$|E
500|$|In Outliers, Gladwell {{interviews}} Gates, {{who says}} that unique access to a computer {{at a time when}} they were not commonplace helped him succeed. Without that access, Gladwell states that Gates would still be [...] "a highly intelligent, driven, charming person and a successful professional", but that he might not be worth US$50billion. Gladwell chooses his words carefully to never mention that Gates' mother was on the board of directors of IBM with access to the whole of IBM, and not just an ordinary daughter of wealthy businessmen as he says. Gladwell explains that reaching the 10,000-Hour Rule, which he considers the key to success in any field, is simply a matter of practicing a specific task that can be accomplished with 20 hours of work a week for 10 years. He also notes that he himself took exactly 10 years to meet the 10,000-Hour Rule, during his brief tenure at <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>Spectator</b> and his more recent job at The Washington Post.|$|E
500|$|Clinton {{received}} sustained {{national attention}} {{for the first}} time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed assertions that Bill Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged [...] "causing pain in my marriage". This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign. During the campaign, Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette's outlook on marriage as described in her classic song [...] "Stand by Your Man", and later in the campaign about how she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead. The remarks were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home mothers and in retrospect, were ill-considered by her own admission. Bill said that in electing him, the nation would [...] "get two for the price of one", referring to the prominent role his wife would assume. Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg's August 1992 <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>Spectator</b> article [...] "The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock", Hillary's own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives. At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth.|$|E
25|$|Murphy dropped one {{suitcase}} bomb each {{on his first}} two bombing runs, both of {{which turned out to}} be duds, and it was his third pass before managed to hit anything: the Mexican custom house near where <b>the</b> crowd of <b>American</b> <b>spectators</b> had formed. <b>The</b> resulting explosion sent small bits of shrapnel and other fragments into the crowd of <b>spectators</b> and caused <b>the</b> <b>American</b> patrons of <b>the</b> bars and clubs on the Mexican side of the border to rush back to their side of the line. Among the casualties were a reporter and a photographer, along with many others, but nobody was killed and all of the injuries were considered minor. After realizing the danger of watching the battle from such a short distance away, the crowd dispersed and went home, some to Fry and Buena.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, <b>the</b> {{politically}} conservative <b>American</b> <b>Spectator</b> magazine received {{donations from}} conservative benefactors. The Arkansas project began shortly after Richard Mellon Scaife, {{one of the}} largest donors to the magazine, directed that his donations be used for stories aimed at investigating potentially scandalous material regarding the Clintons. According to R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr., editor-in-chief of the Spectator, the idea for the Arkansas Project was hatched on a fishing trip on the Chesapeake Bay in the fall of 1993. The [...] "Arkansas Project" [...] name that later became famous was conceived as a joke; the actual name used within the Spectator and the Scaife foundation was the [...] "Editorial Improvement Project." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{allegations}} {{by state}} troopers Larry Patterson and Roger Perry were first reported by David Brock in <b>the</b> conservative magazine <b>American</b> <b>Spectator,</b> {{in a piece}} entitled [...] "His Cheatin' Heart" [...] that was released in December 1993 with a magazine publication date of January 1994. Brock had found the story via a big donor to GOPAC, who connected him to Cliff Jackson, a longtime non-fan of Governor Clinton.Brock's story also included material from two other troopers who wished to remain unnamed. The same four troopers were also interviewed and their charges written about at length by the Los Angeles Times in a story published in December 1993 {{a day after the}} Spectator story came out.

60|$|There was an {{industrial}} fair open at Leipsic which {{they went out}} of the city to see after supper, along with a throng of Leipsickers, whom an hour's interval of fine weather tempted forth on the trolley; {{and with the help of}} a little corporal, who took a fee for his service with the eagerness of a civilian, they got wheeled chairs, and renewed their associations with the great Chicago Fair in seeing the exposition from them. This was not, March said, quite the same as being drawn by a woman-and-dog team, which would have been the right means of doing a German fair; but it was something to have his chair pushed by a slender young girl, whose stalwart brother applied his strength to the chair of the lighter traveller; and it was fit that the girl should reckon the common hire, while the man took the common tip. They made haste to leave the useful aspects of the fair, and had themselves trundled away to the Colonial Exhibit, where they vaguely expected something like the agreeable corruptions of the Midway Plaisance. The idea of her colonial progress with which Germany is trying to affect the home-keeping imagination of her people was illustrated by an encampment of savages from her Central-African possessions. They were getting their supper at the moment the Marches saw them, and were crouching, half naked, around the fires under the kettles, and shivering from the cold, but they were not very characteristic of the imperial expansion, unless perhaps when an old man in a red blanket suddenly sprang up with a knife in his hand and began to chase a boy round the camp. The boy was lighter-footed, and easily outran the sage, who tripped at times on his blanket. None of the other Central Africans seemed to care for the race, and without waiting for <b>the</b> event, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>spectators</b> ordered themselves trundled away to another idle feature of the fair, where they hoped to amuse themselves with the image of Old Leipsic.|$|R
