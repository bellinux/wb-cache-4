[...] My productions were a collection of haphazard observations, put together no doubt {{against the backdrop of}} what I had read. [...] Every beginning author does the same. [...] To be sure, this kind of work was to me a great mortification. [...] <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> asking older authors, and they told me that 'there are no rules, nor can there be any, for the art of novel-writing.' [...] Then , brought to desperation, I set about trying to resolve for myself the question: [...] 'Can literary art be reduced to general rules?' [...] After several years of observing and thinking, the matter began to get clearer for me, and as early as August 1886 I set down my first notes [...] and, God willing, I hope to publish a scientific theory of literary art. [...] I expect that it will contain some fairly new things." ...|$|E
500|$|There's a Riot Goin' On was {{met with}} a divided {{reaction}} from fans and music critics, who {{were not used to}} the album's production and lyrical content. Los Angeles Times writer Robert Hilburn expressed a mixed response towards the band's stylistic change from [...] "soulflavored" [...] songs such as [...] "Everyday People" [...] and [...] "Hot Fun in the Summertime", stating [...] "there is little on the album that is worth your attention". Other major music publications praised this new direction: in his review for Rolling Stone magazine, Vince Aletti wrote that [...] "At first I hated it for its weakness and its lack of energy and I still dislike these qualities. But <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to respect the album's honesty". Aletti cited it as [...] "one of the most important fucking albums this year" [...] and [...] "the new urban music... not about dancing to the music, in the streets. It's about disintegration, getting fucked up, nodding, maybe dying. There are flashes of euphoria, ironic laughter, even some bright stretches but mostly it's just junkie death, oddly unoppressive and almost attractive in its effortlessness". [...] A columnist for Hit Parader magazine gave Riot a favorable review, and stated that the album has [...] "a lot that makes Sly the in-person rave that he is." [...] In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau said [...] "what's expressed is the bitterest ghetto pessimism", backed by [...] "subtle production techniques and jarring song compositions". He declared Riot [...] "one of those rare albums whose whole actually does exceed the sum of its parts". Greil Marcus called the record [...] "Muzak with its finger on the trigger." ...|$|E
500|$|Nine demos were {{recorded}} at The Mill studio in September 2003 by Paul McCartney and his touring band. A month later, in October, album sessions for Memory Almost Full began, and were produced by David Kahne and recorded at Abbey Road Studios. McCartney {{and the band}} recorded the songs [...] "You Tell Me", [...] "Only Mama Knows", [...] "Vintage Clothes", [...] "That Was Me", [...] "Feet in the Clouds", [...] "House of Wax", [...] "The End of the End", and [...] "Whole Life". However, the sessions were cut short and put on hiatus when McCartney started another album, Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, with producer Nigel Godrich. In the website constructed for the album, McCartney stated: [...] "I actually started this album, Memory Almost Full, before my last album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, released September 2005. (...) When I was just finishing up everything concerned with Chaos and had just got the Grammy nominations (2006) I realised I had this album {{to go back to}} and finish off. So I got it out to listen to it again, wondering if I would enjoy it, but actually I really loved it. All I did at first was just listen to a couple of things and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to think, 'OK, I like that track– now, what is wrong with it?' And it might be something like a drum sound, so then I would re-drum and see where we would get to. (...) In places it's a very personal record {{and a lot of it}} is retrospective, drawing from memory, like memories from being a kid, from Liverpool and from summers gone. The album is evocative, emotional, rocking, but I can't really sum it up in one sentence".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of his defeat, Wallace adopted a hard-line segregationist stance and used this stand to court the white vote in the next gubernatorial {{election}} in 1962. When a supporter asked why he started using racist messages, Wallace replied, [...] "You know, I tried to talk about good roads and good schools and all these things that have been part of my career, and nobody listened. And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> talking about niggers, and they stomped the floor." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the case}} of Harvey Lillard, Palmer stated: [...] "I had a case of heart trouble which was not improving. I {{examined}} the spine and found a displaced vertebra pressing against the nerves which innervate the heart. I adjusted the vertebra and gave immediate relief– nothing [...] "accidental" [...] or [...] "crude" [...] about this. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to reason if two diseases, so dissimilar as deafness and heart trouble, came from impingement, a pressure on nerves, were not other disease due to a similar cause? Thus the science (knowledge) and art (adjusting) of Chiropractic were formed at that time." ...|$|E

We lived next door, {{and for a long time}} my mother never got to like it, and at first I disliked it, and then after about a year or so I got used to it, and then I got absorbed in it, then I got infatuated with it. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to wonder if anyone had ever done it. Seriously, not one or two, but seriously; and it seemed to me by that time that it was a very fine industrial subject matter. And I couldn't see anybody at that time who had done it – and nobody had done it, it seemed." ...|$|E

2500|$|The book is {{dedicated}} [...] "To the Wife of My Youth". This dedication {{appears in the}} first printing run of about 5,000 copies, all either in the 1st edition, 1st state binding or in two alternate bindings. In an 1887 printing of Ben-Hur at the Rare Books Department of the Cincinnati Public Library, Lew Wallace wrote to Alexander Hill: [...] "My Dear Friend HillWhen Ben-Hur was finished, I told my wife {{it was to be}} dedicated to her, and that she must furnish the inscription. She wrote 'To the Wife of My Youth' / The book became popular; <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to receive letters of sympathy and enquiries as to when and of what poor Mrs. Wallace died. I laughed at first, but the condolences multiplied until finally I told the good woman that having got me into the trouble she must now get me out, which she did by adding the words--'Who still abides with me.' / The device was perfect." [...] Wallace apparently also received many marriage proposals due to the misunderstanding.|$|E

60|$|I grew {{dizzy and}} sick at the thought, but she caught me and held me to her. Presently {{we sat down}} on the door log, gazing at the corpse. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to reflect, and took out my powder gourd and loaded the pistol.|$|E

60|$|I {{looked at}} him, {{and it was}} <b>then</b> that <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to fancy him no longer in his right mind. He was peering up to me, as if for sympathy, a timid joy in his eyes. All that had passed between us was already {{forgotten}} in the prospect of this fresh disaster.|$|R
