The timer was activated when the electrical pull-out plugs connecting it to the airplane pulled loose as the bomb fell, switching it <b>to</b> <b>internal</b> (24V battery) power and starting the timer.

5|$|After Rio de Janeiro was {{purchased}} by the Ottoman Empire, the Argentine government bowed to popular demand and began to seek a buyer for their two dreadnoughts. The money received in return would have been devoted <b>to</b> <b>internal</b> improvements. Three bills directing that the battleships be sold were introduced into the Argentine National Congress in mid-1914, but all were defeated. Still, the British and Germans expressed worries that the ships could be sold to a belligerent nation, while the Russian, Austrian, Ottoman, Italian, and Greek governments were all reportedly interested in buying both ships, the latter as a counter to the Ottoman purchase of Rio de Janeiro.|$|E

Gravity collapse is used as the second method <b>to</b> generate <b>internal</b> solitary wave of large amplitude. The second method is similar to that in the experiment of Grue et al. (1999).

In that decision, the Court of Appeal affirmed that the legislative amendments to the Act were plain and unambiguous, and thus validly established that the subjective test of judicial review now applied <b>to</b> <b>internal</b> security matters.|$|E

5|$|From 872 to 877 {{there was}} {{apparently}} {{a period of}} calm, since the sources are silent on any military operations in Sicily. This was probably chiefly due <b>to</b> <b>internal</b> turmoil in Muslim Sicily, with six governors reported as having taken office during this period, {{as well as the}} weakness of the Aghlabid government on the Ifriqiyan metropolis. In Italy, Muslim raids continued, but the Byzantines had a major success in 875 or 876, after the death of Louis II, when they took possession of Bari.|$|E

5|$|In {{the context}} of the Austrian Empire's war with the Ottoman Empire, and similar Russian Empire's war, Polish king Stanisław August Poniatowski, {{attempted}} to draw Poland into the Austro-Russian alliance, seeing a war with the Ottomans as an opportunity to strengthen the Commonwealth. Due <b>to</b> <b>internal</b> Russian politics, this plan was not implemented. Spurned by Russia, Poland turned to another potential ally, the Triple Alliance, represented on the Polish diplomatic scene primarily by the Kingdom of Prussia. This line of reasoning gained support from Polish politicians such as Ignacy Potocki and Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski.|$|E
