The on-site staff of Career Counselors teach students how to use a strategic approach in planning for a career path and job search. Career Services helps undergraduates self-assess, learn how to conduct career research, seek out experiences that will give you <b>transferable</b> <b>skills,</b> and search for full-time employment or prepare for graduate school. The office also provides similar assistance to graduate students and alumni to break onto the scene in their field of study and assist them in creating a brand for themselves and gain the tools necessary to be a real competitor in the workforce.|$|E
25|$|APO Leads (stylized as APO LEADS) is a {{leadership}} development program {{organized by the}} national organization of Alpha Phi Omega in the United States. The APO Leads program consists of five individual modular components of leadership development. Each of these modular components focus on skills {{that will help the}} participant be a successful leader and team member in Alpha Phi Omega and in life. The five components of APO Leads are Launch, Explore, Achieve, Discover, and Serve. Launch is a pre-requisite for participation in any of the other four courses. At the completion of the series of courses, the participant will have a set of <b>transferable</b> <b>skills</b> that are applicable to Alpha Phi Omega, to the working world, as well as to leadership in other organizations. APO Leads has its roots in an earlier program, the Leadership Development Workshop (LDW). The LDW was an all-day, eight-hour leadership development course that was offered to members during the 1980s and 1990s. It was reorganized into the current APO Leads program, which was rolled out in 2002.|$|E
25|$|During the transition, many {{or most of}} the {{employees}} of the IRS (105,978 in 2005) would face loss of employment. The Beacon Hill Institute estimate is that the federal government would be able to cut $8 billion from the IRS budget of $11.01 billion (in 2007), reducing the size of federal tax administration by 73%. In addition, income tax preparers (many seasonal), tax lawyers, tax compliance staff in medium-to-large businesses, and software companies which sell tax preparation software (such as Drake Software, TaxCut, and TurboTax), could face significant drops, changes, or loss of employment. Proponents state the income tax industry often provides year-round services for financial planning and investment, which is expected to increase under the FairTax proposal and could offset some of these changes. New technologies used by the IRS, such as e-filing, are simplifying the process and already threatening a portion of this industry as goals set by Congress call for at least 80% of federal returns to be submitted electronically by 2007. According to IRS testimony from 2004, 45% of revenue agents and officers would become eligible for retirement in the following 5 years and there is concern about the loss of their work force as their hiring efforts struggle to keep pace with attrition. In addition, the IRS would not go completely out of commission until 3 years after the FairTax was enacted, providing employees time to find other employment. Proponents claim the projected 10.5% growth in the economy {{during the first year of}} the FairTax would provide plenty of new jobs to these workers that are typically well educated and well equipped with <b>transferable</b> <b>skills</b> (see creative destruction).|$|E

It examines the changing position of research skills within higher education in recent years and looks for possible reasons for those changes. There are three main conclusions. First, training in research skills has been shifting down from doctoral programmes into Masters and increasingly into undergraduate programmes. Second, this development can be explained in terms of: a growing requirement for students to be able to plan and manage their own learning, changing trends in graduate employment; and the growth of a knowledge-based society. Third, research has become a <b>transferable</b> <b>skill.</b> The last of these conclusions has implications for the location of research within the higher education curriculum...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} the {{reflection on the}} fieldwork conducted in 2014 - 15. The research analysed the link and interplay between Chechen demographic dynamics and Russo-Chechen conflict. The question was approached reflexively: the research population consisted only of Chechen refugees in Europe. The analysis targeted their opinion on the relevant topic. This article justifies the choice of doing reflexive research. The main reasoning is related to inaccessibility of informants in the Chechen Republic. Furthermore, the article describes the pluses and minuses of this approach and presents the methodological choices made during the fieldwork and before. In sum, it intends to turn the gained experience into a <b>transferable</b> <b>skill</b> advising future researchers on {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of applied research methods and warns about the traps that they might face during the fieldwork...|$|R

Furthermore, the size of the welfare gain to be reaped by moving from non-cooperative to the cooperative organization of migration also depends on the strength of the sector-speci…c brain gain...|$|R
40|$|Much recent {{literature}} on assessment {{in higher education}} (HE) gives strong support {{to the use of}} both peer and self-assessment (Boud, 1995; Brown & Knight, 1994; Gibbs, 2001; Brown, Bull & Pendlebury, 1997; Brown & Glasner, 1998; Brown & Dove, 1990). Self-assessment is regarded as a <b>transferable</b> <b>skill</b> and a principal part of the student learning experience. Peer assessment is the assessment of the work of others with equal status and usually has an element of mutuality. Underpinning a peer-assessment process is the giving and receiving feedback from which continued reflection and perhaps dialogue may continue. Brown et al (1997) draw a distinction between ‘peer assessment’, ‘peer marking’ - the process by which someone makes an estimate of another’s work - and ‘peer feedback marking’ which involves students deriving criteria, developing a peer assessment form, providing anonymous feedback and assigning a global mark. In the context of this study, the term "peer-assessment" is more closely allied to this concept of "peer feedback marking"...|$|R
