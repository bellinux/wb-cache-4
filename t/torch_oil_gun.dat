40|$|Abstract:Air cooled <b>oil</b> <b>gun</b> (parallel type � External mixing) is {{most widely}} used <b>oil</b> <b>gun</b> in Indian thermal power plant because it is very simple, easy to operate, maintain, {{replacement}} (damaged part) and also it is cheaper than auto retract type <b>oil</b> <b>gun.</b> The main aim {{of this paper is}} to give clear idea for <b>oil</b> <b>gun</b> general arrangement, operation and maintenance. Generally in thermal power stations <b>oil</b> <b>gun</b> is not properly maintained because they might not know the proper maintenance. They do only regular maintenance which was intimated by the <b>oil</b> <b>gun</b> supplier. But the supplier does not know the working (boiler) conditions of power plant. I hereby given some suggestion for operation, handling and maintenance of <b>oil</b> <b>gun,</b> by this we can reduce frequent cleaning of <b>oil</b> <b>gun</b> and workers work load...|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 6 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 30 June - 2 July, 2008. It {{is very important for}} China to reduce the consumption of petroleum under the pressure of hers fundamental realities of lean-oil [...] rich-coal and the consistently increasing price of international crude oil. For this reason, we developed series of minimal-oil igniting burners applied on the boilers in power stations to reduce the oil consumption for ignition. The most significant characteristic of the burners is the average ignitingoil reduction by over 95 %. This superior performance can be assured by some built-in igniting <b>oil</b> <b>guns</b> and by some novel designs for the minimal-oil burners. Up to now, the technology has achieved remarkable success on over 30 power units in China. vk 201...|$|R

5000|$|On August 31, Kurdish Peshmerga troops entered Zumar. The Kurdish forces {{launched}} the offensive after capturing the Ain Zala oilfields just outside Zumar two days earlier. ISIL fighters <b>torched</b> three <b>oil</b> wells as they retreated from Ain Zala. The Peshmerga {{have been able}} to recapture several ISIL-controlled towns after receiving weaponry from the United States and other nations. As a result of the attack by Peshmerga forces on the Zumar, more than 92 ISIL militants have been killed and a further 160 taken to hospitals in Mosul with severe injuries. Kurdish forces were eventually forced to leave Zumar after enduring heavy losses.|$|R
50|$|Other minor {{differences}} included {{fuel gauge}} placement, with the UK Phantom I's at the tank but some US models having {{one on the}} dash, and manual central lubrication systems. The UK Phantom employed Enots nipples, some {{times as many as}} 50, which required attachment of a special Enots <b>oil</b> pressure <b>gun</b> and needed time-consuming service at 500, 1000 and 2000 mile intervals; the US model used a centralized Bijur system which lubricated all the oiling points with a stroke of a single pump.|$|R

The boy clapped his hands in delight at the beauties of the carved and panelled walls and the oak beamed ceiling, stained almost black from the smoke of <b>torches</b> and <b>oil</b> cressets that had lighted it in bygone days, aided, no doubt, by the wood fires which had burned in its two immense fireplaces to cheer the merry throng of noble revellers that had so often sat about the great table into the morning hours.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} presents, to our knowledge, the first ambient air data {{for a range}} of polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Kuwait. This was achieved by concurrently deploying polyurethane foam–disk passive samplers at 14 sites over a six-week period. Calculated mean Σ 5 PBDE concentrations (sum of brominated diphenyl ethers [BDEs] 47, 99, 100, 153, and 154) ranged from 2. 5 to 32 pg/m 3 of air, with BDE 47 contributing between 39 and 65 % of the ΣPBDEs detected. Differences in relative concentrations were observed between sites, with higher concentrations measured close to suspected sources. Calculated ΣPAH concentrations ranged from 5 to 13 ng/m 3 (mean, 8. 3 ng/m 3). The compound distribution was dominated by three- and four-ring compounds, which constituted approximately 90 % of the ΣPAHs, with phenanthrene contributing approximately 35 %. However, the proportion of five- and six-ring PAHs increased around the “oil lakes,” which were formed by the <b>torching</b> of <b>oil</b> wells during the 1991 Gulf War. The oil lakes are a reservoir of PAHs that will continue feeding the atmosphere as long as they remain untreated...|$|R
5000|$|An {{unexpected}} {{period of}} peace ends when Rachel is again harassed by Chandler, who sells his farm {{and moves to}} Peyton Place, where he strong-arms Leslie into hiring him at the mill and continues harassing Rachel. Elliot seems {{to get closer to}} the truth about Chandler. After the preliminary hearing, Martin accuses Steven of leaving the grown-ups to clean up [...] "his" [...] mess yet again. Steven and Betty find the Peyton mansion ablaze, compelling Steven to resuce Martin. Departing Hannah started the fire by <b>torching</b> the <b>oil</b> portrait of Catherine. After hospitalised Martin asks Steven his [...] "price" [...] for saving him, Steven names it---and moves into the mansion with Betty, ostensibly to keep his enemy close. Martin does the same with Lee, whom he hires as his chauffeur, hoping to make him pay eventually for killing Ann. Leslie, meanwhile, is unamused with Steven seeming to have become Peyton's favorite son; Steven, concurrently, is uneasy about Martin trying to maneuver him into a political future. Rodney and Sandy enjoy dates but when Lee tries to strongarm Sandy physically into returning to her marriage, Rodney surprisingly knocks Lee down with a punch.|$|R

50|$|As built, {{the ships}} were armed with one 4.7 in/40 gun, four 3 in/40 guns, and two 17.7 in torpedo tubes. In 1914 they were {{augmented}} {{with an additional}} two torpedo tubes. During World War I, guide rails for laying up to ten mines {{were added to the}} ships. Later wartime changes replaced all the guns with five 4 in/35 and a single 40 mm/39 AA <b>gun.</b> <b>Oil</b> capacity was also increased during the war from 100 MT to 128 MT in order to increase endurance, but the increased weight had the opposite effect: slowing the ships and reduced their endurance.|$|R

50|$|The 8 {{day long}} annual festival in Makaram (January) {{is a very}} vibrant event in the whole region commencing with the {{hoisting}} of the temple flag on Makara Samkramam day, and concluding with ‘Arattu’ (Ritual Bath of the deity) on 8th day. Besides the regular daily rituals the festivities include processions of the deity on elephant’s back to the suburban villages like Kizhaparayar, Keezhambara, Chittanappara and bharananganam (on 5 days) the precious ‘Utsava Bali’ (for 6 days) and art and cultural programs every day. The ‘Arattu’, typical of the 'Arattu' in almost any temple, is a magnificent night-long ceremony including procession of several elephants and performances by major percussion teams. The slow-moving procession of the caparisoned elephants carrying decorative silken umbrellas and other paraphernalia, illumined by multi-tongued <b>oil</b> <b>torches,</b> is a gorgeous spectacle, a delightful experience for the participants.|$|R
50|$|Ofer's parents {{moved to}} British Mandatory Palestine during the Third Aliyah and {{were among the}} founders of the {{settlement}} Kfar Azar. As a youth, Ofer joined the Haganah. He initially delivered Haganah newspapers to its subscribers, hung pro-Haganah posters {{in the middle of the}} night and <b>oiled</b> the <b>guns</b> belonging to the settlement. At sixteen, he left school and joined the Palmach, the elite strike force of the Haganah. He fought in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, and participated in Operation Danny in which the Arab occupied towns of Lod and Ramle fell to Jewish forces. His military talents did not go unnoticed and he was handpicked for officer’s training. In the midst of his training, he learned that his Palmach unit was gearing up for Operation Yoav, an offensive in the Negev region. He left officer’s school to join his unit in time for the offensive. By the end of the war, he attained the rank of sergeant while his classmates had not yet enlisted in the army.|$|R

The wooden stocks originally had a quick-release base but the ones sold in the United States have a permanent base to be compliant with US gun laws.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{approach}} {{for the analysis}} of aerosol absorption coefficient measurements is presented. A 7 -wavelenghts aethalometer has been employed to identify brown carbon (BrC) and black carbon (BC) and to detect organic carbon (OC) in fine atmospheric aerosols (PM 2. 5). The Magee Aethalometer estimates the BC content in atmospheric particulate by measuring the light attenuation in the aerosols accumulated on a quartz filter, at the standard wavelength λ = 0. 88 μm. The known Magee algorithm is based on the hypothesis of a mass absorption coefficient inversely proportional to the wavelength. The new algorithm has been developed and applied to the whole spectral range; it verifies the spectral absorption behavior and, thus, it distinguishes between black and brown carbon. Moreover, it allows also to correct the absorption estimation at the UV wavelength commonly used to qualitatively detect the presence of mixed hydrocarbons. The algorithm has been applied to data collected in Agri Valley, located in Southern Italy, where <b>torched</b> crude <b>oil</b> undergoes a pre-treatment process. The Magee Aethalometer has been set to measure Aerosol absorption coefficients τ aer (λ, t) every 5 min. Wavelength dependence of τ aer (λ, t) has been analyzed by a best-fit technique and, excluding UV-wavelengths, both the absorption Angstrom coefficient α and the BC (or BrC) concentration have been determined. Finally, daily histograms of α provide information on optical properties of carbonaceous aerosol, while the extrapolation at UV-wavelengths gives information on the presence of semivolatile organic carbon (OC) particles...|$|R
5|$|Though the Admiralty {{arranged}} {{for some of}} the ships to be salvaged, most were left {{at the bottom of the}} sound until entrepreneur Ernest Cox bought the salvage rights and began to raise the remaining ships in the early 1920s. Bremse presented particular challenges. She had come to rest perched precariously on a rock, which sloped away dramatically, causing fears that she might slip off and sink in deeper water. Cox's salvage team sealed her bulkheads and divided the hull into watertight compartments. The hull was patched up and an airlock fitted, but the team ran into difficulties with the large amount of oil which covered the wreck, more than had been found in any other of the ships salvaged previously. A three-man team using oxyacetylene <b>torches</b> ignited some <b>oil,</b> causing an explosion. The men escaped without serious injuries, and thereafter small explosions and fires were common over the two months it took to prepare the ship, though no one was injured.|$|R
50|$|The police {{surgeon who}} {{was called to}} Colin Roach's corpse in the foyer of the police station said that the body {{position}} was inconsistent with suicide. The shotgun with which he was killed could not be fitted into the sports bag Roach had with him, not even when broken down. No fibers from the bag {{were found on the}} <b>gun</b> and no <b>oil</b> from the <b>gun</b> was found in the bag. When a shotgun is used for suicide the recoil damages and sometimes breaks the trigger thumb. No injury was found to Roach's hand at all. The recoiling gun will normally hit a wall or floor very hard but no marks from this were found in the police station foyer or on the gun butt.|$|R
5000|$|... 246 Battery emplaced eight 3.7-inch guns at Pembroke Dock {{to defend}} the <b>oil</b> terminal. The <b>guns</b> were {{unloaded}} on 24 August and were in action against an air raid the following day. There was a heavy raid on Swansea from 20.55 to 03.00 {{on the night of}} 1/2 September, but because RAF night fighters were in the area, 247 Bty was prevented from firing for the first three hours. After that raid, Lt-Col Raikes of 79th (HY) Rgt devised a new barrage scheme for the Swansea GDA codenamed 'Ball of Fire'.

2500|$|Admiral John Fisher, {{responsible}} for {{reconstruction of the}} British fleet in the pre-war period, favoured large <b>guns,</b> <b>oil</b> fuel, and speed. Admiral Tirpitz, {{responsible for}} the German fleet, favoured ship survivability and chose to sacrifice some gun size for improved armour. The German battlecruiser [...] had belt armour equivalent in thickness—though not as comprehensive—to the British battleship , significantly better than on the British battlecruisers such as Tiger. German ships had better internal subdivision and had fewer doors and other weak points in their bulkheads, but with the disadvantage that space for crew was greatly reduced. As they were designed only for sorties in the North Sea they {{did not need to}} be as habitable as the British vessels and their crews could live in barracks ashore when in harbour.|$|R

50|$|Brown's straggling B-17 was now {{attacked}} by {{over a dozen}} enemy fighters (a mixture of Messerschmitt Bf 109s and Focke-Wulf Fw 190s) of JG 11 for over 10 minutes. Further damage was sustained, including damage to the number three engine, which would produce only half power (meaning the aircraft had at best 40% of its total rated power available). The bomber's internal oxygen, hydraulic and electrical systems were also damaged, and the bomber lost half of its rudder and its port (left side) elevator, {{as well as its}} nose cone. Many of the gunners' weapons then jammed, probably as a result of loss of the onboard systems leading to frozen mechanisms (the ground crew did not <b>oil</b> the <b>guns</b> correctly), leaving the bomber with only two dorsal turret guns and one of three forward-firing nose guns (from eleven available) for defense. Most of the crew were wounded: the tail gunner, Eckenrode, had been decapitated by a direct hit from a cannon shell, while Yelesanko was critically wounded in the leg by shrapnel, Blackford's feet were frozen due to shorted-out heating wires in his uniform, Pechout had been hit in the eye by a cannon shell, and Brown was wounded in his right shoulder. The morphine syrettes onboard froze, complicating first aid efforts by the crew, while the radio was destroyed and the bomber's exterior heavily damaged. Miraculously, all but Eckenrode survived.|$|R

500|$|By {{this stage}} in the war, the German {{submarine}} authorities had {{become aware of the}} existence of Q-ships and Captain Ernst Rosenow of [...] was taking no risks with his target, remaining at [...] distance watching the staged panicked evacuation of the ship. While the hidden gun crews watched the enemy approach the lifeboats, the officer in charge of the boats, Lieutenant Francis Hereford, realised that the submarine would follow his movements, as its commander assumed him to be the captain. Hereford therefore ordered his men to row back towards the ship, thus luring the enemy into range. This made the submarine commander believe that the ship’s crew were planning to regain their vessel and he immediately closed to just , surfaced and began angrily semaphoring to the [...] "survivors" [...] in the boats. This was exactly what the gun crews had been waiting for and a volley of fire was directed at the U-boat. Numerous holes were blown in the conning tower and the submarine desperately attempted to flee on the surface before slowing down and heeling over, trailing <b>oil.</b> The <b>gun</b> crews then stopped firing only for the submarine to suddenly restart its engines and attempt to escape. In a final barrage of fire the submarine was hit fatally, a large explosion blowing the vessel in two. Rosenow and 22 of his crew were killed, while two survivors were rescued by the panic party.|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} a multibody system is {{established}} to investigate the dynamic response of an <b>oil</b> tube-shock absorber-perforating <b>gun</b> system in downhole perforation-test joint operation. In the model, the oil tube and perforating gun are modeled as elastic rods and the shock absorber is modeled as single particle system with damping and a spring. Two force continuity conditions are used to simulate the interactions among the three components. The perforation impact load is determined by an experiment of underwater explosion of perforating bullets. Using the model, the effects of charge quantity of perforating bullet, the number of shock absorbers, {{and the length of}} oil tube on the dynamic response of oil tube and packer are investigated. On this basis, a basic principle of the combination design of shock absorber and oil tube is proposed to improve the mechanical state of downhole tools.
