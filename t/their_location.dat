40|$|Abstract — Two further results, which {{extend the}} {{previous}} {{work on the}} use of rigidity in sensor network localization, are given. The previous work provided the conditions for the localization of an entire network in which some nodes know <b>their</b> <b>locations</b> and other nodes determine <b>their</b> <b>locations</b> by measuring the distances to their neighbors. First, the paper gives the conditions for partial localization of a subnetwork when an entire network is not localizable. Second, the paper gives the conditions for localization in which some nodes know <b>their</b> <b>locations</b> and other nodes determine <b>their</b> <b>locations</b> by measuring the bearings (angle of arrivals) to their neighbors rather than the distances.

5|$|Although the Luzhniki Stadium had a usual {{capacity}} of almost 85,000 spectators, that {{was reduced to}} 69,500 for the final. Of those tickets, approximately 21,000 were reserved for each finalist club, with a further 10,500 available for purchase {{by the general public}} via the UEFA website. Recipients of those tickets were determined by a random ballot following an online application process that ran from 28 February to 19 March 2008. Tickets were available in three categories, priced at €80, €140 and €200 depending on <b>their</b> <b>location</b> in the stadium.

The solar panels are expected to last for at least 35 years, and a catwalk is located below the roof if any solar panel replacements were ever needed. As a bonus feature, a low voltage current, which is emitted from the panels, serves as a deterrent against pigeons.|$|E

Many of the buildings are connected above ground as well as through an extensive network of underground tunnels, providing protection from the Cambridge weather as well as a venue for roof and tunnel hacking.|$|E
5|$|Heavy atom methods (multiple {{isomorphous}} replacement)– If electron-dense metal atoms can {{be introduced}} into the crystal, direct methods or Patterson-space methods {{can be used to}} determine <b>their</b> <b>location</b> and to obtain initial phases. Such heavy atoms can be introduced either by soaking the crystal in a heavy atom-containing solution, or by co-crystallization (growing the crystals {{in the presence of a}} heavy atom). As in MAD phasing, the changes in the scattering amplitudes can be interpreted to yield the phases. Although this is the original method by which protein crystal structures were solved, it has largely been superseded by MAD phasing with selenomethionine.|$|E
