25|$|Popular Epiphany customs include Epiphany singing, {{chalking}} the door, having one's house blessed, consuming Three Kings Cake, winter swimming, {{as well as}} attending church services. It is customary for Christians in many localities {{to remove}} their Christmas decorations on Epiphany Eve (Twelfth Night), although those in other Christian countries historically remove them on Candlemas, the conclusion of Epiphanytide. According to the first tradition, those who fail <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>to</b> remove their Christmas decorations on Epiphany Eve must leave them untouched until Candlemas, the second opportunity to remove them; failure to observe this custom is considered inauspicious.|$|E
25|$|The preparatory attentional {{and memory}} (PAM) theory proposes {{two types of}} {{processes}} involved in successful prospective memory performance. The first component of this theory involves a monitoring process that begins when a person constructs an intention that is then maintained until it is performed. This monitoring component involves a capacity-consuming process, {{similar to those used}} when maintaining attention, because {{there is a need for}} the intention to be stored and maintained in memory. The second component involves the use of elements of retrospective memory processes. These elements are used to differentiate between the wanted prospective memory intention and unwanted thoughts, in an attempt to keep focus on the goal and not the other options surrounding it. Retrospective memory is also used to remember specifically what intention is supposed to be performed in the future, and the monitoring process is needed to be able <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>to</b> perform this action at the correct condition or time.|$|E

500|$|Some media commentators, such as Howard Kurtz and Toby Harnden, criticized {{what they}} {{perceived}} as {{a rush to judgment}} about the shooter's motivation, disputing suggestions that the shooting {{was the result of the}} Tea Party movement or anything in connection to Palin. Paul Krugman wrote an op-ed piece arguing that political rhetoric had become toxic. With renewed calls to tone down political rhetoric after the shooting, Keith Olbermann said, [...] "Violence, or the threat of violence, has no place in our Democracy, and I apologize for and repudiate any act or any thing in my past that may have even inadvertently encouraged violence." [...] Jon Stewart stated that he did not know whether or not the political environment contributed to the shooting, but, [...] "For all the hyperbole and vitriol that's become a part of our political process—when the reality of that rhetoric, when actions match the disturbing nature of words, we haven't lost our capacity to be horrified. ...

The end of Zelenka's video message ("drž se miláčku" [...] "take care, darling") was ad-libbed, but Nykl left it to the writers to create Zelenka's backstory. But during the show's run, Zelenka only ever mentions having a brother, a sister, and a nephew, and is never shown to be or {{have been in a}} romantic relationship.|$|E

Parker finally brought Presley to national television, booking him on CBS's Stage Show for six appearances over two months.

After his first appearance, on January 28, introduced by disc jockey Bill Randle, Presley stayed in town to record at RCA's New York studio.

2500|$|It is {{important}} {{to be able to keep}} track of future intentions and plans, and most importantly, individuals need <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>to</b> actually carry out such intentions and plans. [...] This memory for future events is prospective memory. [...] Prospective memory includes forming the intention to carry out a particular task in the future, which action we’re going to use to carry out the action, and when we want to do it. [...] Thus, prospective memory is in use continuously in day to day life. [...] For example, prospective memory is in use when you decide that you need to write and send a letter to a friend.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two types}} of {{prospective}} memory; event-based and time based. [...] Event-based prospective memory is when an environmental cue prompts you to carry out a task.

[...] An example of this is remembering to phone your sister on her birthday. [...] Time-based prospective memory is more difficult than event-based prospective memory because there is no environmental cue prompting one <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>to</b> carry out the task at that specific time.|$|E

Pregnant women [...] are more likely <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>to</b> perform an intention after the cue has already passed.

2500|$|Songs to Remember {{received}} a favourable reception from the UK music press on its release. Melody Maker stated that [...] "Green's determination to stamp his brandmark into the nation's consciousness is {{reflected by the}} album's pompous title... Yet {{the funny thing is}} those dubious proclamations just aren't needed because the arrogance embodied in the title is emphatically based on vinyl reality... Some people may find Green's sugary vocals and Adam Kidron's lush production just a little too refined; listening to Scritti can be a bit like having honey tipped down your ears, but that seems like a perfect design for mainstream invasion. If justice prevailed Songs to Remember would be number one across the globe... You'd have to go back a long way to find a better pop record than this – back to the Sixties probably." [...] NME noted that six of the album's nine tracks had already appeared in some form on the singles, and wryly described Songs to Remember as [...] "Scritti Politti's greatest hits... It's by no means a disturbing record to listen to, which is why it could appeal to the timid, but Green's lyrical preoccupations – language, definitions, the way one's preconceptions determine and control perception – would intrigue the curious... Songs to Remember is witty, ingenious, likeable and probably in the public interest." [...] Smash Hits felt that [...] "the two years it took to make may have blunted its impact somewhat" [...] but [...] "there's more than enough in Songs <b>to</b> <b>Remember</b> <b>to</b> establish Scritti Politti as the acceptable face of intellectual pop." ...|$|E
