25|$|Symptoms {{and signs}} vary {{depending}} on the type of hernia. Symptoms may or may not be present in some inguinal hernias. In the case of reducible hernias, a bulge in the groin or in another abdominal area can often be seen and felt. When standing, such a bulge becomes more obvious. Besides the bulge, other symptoms include pain in the groin that may also include a heavy or dragging sensation, and in men, there is sometimes pain and swelling in the scrotum around the <b>testicular</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
40|$|Contents: Ultrasound {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} forms of non-invasive contraception and has been studied in several animal models. The objective of the current investigation was to determine the most practical and effective application protocol for dog sterilization. A total of 100 dogs were divided into five equal groups. Group A received 5 -min applications three times performed at 48 -hr intervals and covering the entire <b>testicular</b> <b>area</b> at frequency of 1 MHz; Group B received 5 -min applications three times performed at 48 -hr intervals over the dorso-cranial area of the testis at frequency of 3 MHz; Group C received three sequential 5 -min applications (at 5 -min intervals between applications) covering the entire <b>testicular</b> <b>area</b> at frequency of 1 MHz; Group D received 15 -min applications two times performed at 48 -hr intervals and covering the entire <b>testicular</b> <b>area</b> at frequency of 1 MHz. The experimental groups' ultrasound had an intensity of 1. 5 W/cm 2. The Control Group had the same procedure as Group A, but with the transducer switched-off. Dogs were surgically castrated 40 days following the treatment for histological examination. Azoospermia, testicular volume reduction and apparently irreversible testicular damage were achieved by Group A. No effects were noticed in the other groups. Testosterone levels remained within physiological range with all application protocols. A regimen of three applications of ultrasound at 1 MHz, and 1. 5 W/cm 2, lasting 5 min with an interval of 48 h was effective as permanent sterilization in the dog without hormonal impact...|$|E

40|$|Some male {{seasonal}} breeders undergo testicular {{growth and}} regression throughout the year. The {{objective of this}} study was to understand the effect of seasonality on: (i) microvasculature of cat testes; (ii) angiogenic activity in testicular tissue in vitro; and (iii) testicular endothelial cells expression throughout the year. <b>Testicular</b> vascular <b>areas</b> increased in March and April, June and July, being the highest in November and December.

Even though CD 143 expression was higher in December, smaller peaks were present in April and July. As changes in angiogenesis may play a role on testes vascular growth and regression during the breeding and non-breeding seasons, data suggest that testicular vascularisation in cats is increased in three photoperiod windows of time, November/December, March/April and June/July. This increase in testicular vascularisation might be related to higher seasonal sexual activity in cats, which is in agreement with the fact that most queens give birth at the beginning of the year, between May and July, and in September...|$|R
40|$|Previous work in dogfish, Scyliorhinus canicula, has {{identified}} the <b>testicular</b> germinative <b>area</b> as the {{spermatogonial stem cell}} niche. In the present study, an in vitro co-culture system of spermatogonia and somatic cells from the germinative area was developed. Long-term maintenance of spermatogonia has been successful, and addition of GDNF has promoted the develop-ment of clones of spermatogonia expressing stem cell charac-teristics such as alkaline phosphatase activity and has allowed maintenance of self-renewal in spermatogonia for at least 5 mo under culture conditions, notably by decreasing cell apoptosis. Furthermore, clones of spermatogonia expressed the receptor of GDNF, GFRalpha 1, {{which is consistent with}} the effect of GDNF on cells despite the lack of identification of a GDNF sequence in the dogfish’s transcriptome. However, a sequence homologous to artemin has been identified, and in silico analysis supports the hypothesis that artemin could replace GDNF in the germinative area in dogfish. This study, as the first report on long-term in vitro maintenance of spermatogonia in a chondrichthyan species, suggests that the GFRalpha 1 signaling function in self-renewal of spermatogonial stem cells is probably conserved in gnathostomes. culture, dogfish, GDNF, self-renewal, spermatogonial stem cell...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{fertilizing}} ability and DNA damage response of preimplantation stage embryos {{derived from the}} γ-irradiated mouse sperm carrying varying amounts of DNA strand-breaks. Material and Methods: The DNA damage in the sperm was induced by exposing the <b>testicular</b> <b>area</b> to different doses of γ-radiation. After mating with healthy female mice, sperm zona binding, fertilizing ability of DNA damaged sperm and developmental competence of embryos derived from the DNA damaged sperm were assessed. Results: The in vivo zona binding ability and fertilizing ability of DNA damaged sperm was significantly affected in the 5. 0 and 10. 0 Gy sperm irradiation groups. Although {{the development of the}} embryos derived from the DNA damaged sperm was not significantly affected until day 2. 5 post-coitus, further development was significantly altered, as evidenced by the total cell number in the embryos. Conclusion: The sperm carrying DNA strand breaks still has the ability to fertilize the oocyte normally. However, the events like zona-binding and successful fertilization depend on the extent of sperm DNA fragmentation. The study has also showed a great heterogeneity in embryonic development at peri-implantation period with respect to the degree of sperm DNA damage...|$|E

40|$|The {{straight}} spermatic {{and highly}} convoluted testicular arteries were studied by light microscopy in adult and aging normotensive (NT) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats. In younger rats, {{on the internal}} part of bends of the <b>testicular</b> artery, <b>areas</b> lacking the media similar to classical cerebral arterial medial defects were observed. At the same location, in other bends, structurally defective areas (SDA) constituted by or including medial defects but also lacking the internal elastic lamina and which in some cases evaginated, were present. Structurally defective areas were less numerous in SHR than in NT rats at 6 months, suggesting that intrinsic differences may exist between rat strains. In contrast, in old rats, the number of SDA was higher in hypertensive than in normotensive rats, supporting the role of hemodynamics in SDA formation. With age, SDA enlarged in both rat strains, {{and most of them}} became structurally similar to aneurysms, ie, lacking the internal elastic lamina and medial cells and with a dilated lumen, supporting the view that medial defects are sites of aneurysmal structure development. In hypertensive rats, fibrin and lipid deposits occurred within these aneurysmal-like structures. In the straight part of the spermatic artery no such structural modifications occurred, suggesting that either hemodynamics and/or structural development, both dependent on arterial geometry, are determinant in SDA formation. The results are discussed in view of the use of the rat testicular artery as a possible model of the formation of spontaneous aneurysmal-like structures relevant to cerebral aneurysms...|$|R
40|$|Roe {{deer are}} {{seasonal}} breeders and show cyclic variation in testicular volume and cellular differentiation within the tubular and interstitial testis compartment. We have employed the roe deer {{as a model}} to elucidate {{the expression of the}} postpubertal Leydig cell marker INSL 3 during seasonal changes in Leydig cell differentiation. Roe deer testis and serum samples were collect-ed bimonthly throughout the complete reproductive cycle. Peak levels of testicular Insl 3 mRNA and INSL 3 immunoprotein were detected well before the onset of rut in April and coincided with the highest percentage of INSL 3 -positive cell number/square millimeter of <b>testicular</b> interstitial <b>area.</b> During the winter (De-cember, February), roe deer INSL 3 was exclusively detected in a subpopulation of alpha-actin-negative, spindle-shaped peritu-bular cells. Concordant with the increase in INSL 3 production in April and 1 mo after the reported LH peak, a sharp increase in serum testosterone concentrations was observed. High serum testosterone concentrations coincided with the presence of de-tectable 17 alpha-hydroxylase, mRNA and protein, in Leydig cells. Upregulation of INSL 3 production in spring appeared to reflect LH-dependent differentiation of Leydig cells. The consid-erable changes in percentage of INSL 3 immunopositive cells within the numerically constant interstitial cell population in-dicated cyclic seasonal de- and redifferentiation of Leydig cells. A complex functional role of the INSL 3 /LGR 8 ligand-receptor system in the roe deer testis was suggested by the detection of specific hybridization signals for roe deer Lgr 8 transcripts in Ser-toli cells of the roe deer testis.

40|$|Introduction: Orchialgia {{following}} {{inguinal hernia}} repair is rare complication and still challenging since {{there has been}} no established surgical treatment because of complexity of nerve innervation to the <b>testicular</b> <b>area.</b> Herein we report a case of postoperative orchialgia following Lichtenstein repair, which was successfully treated by mesh removal, orchiectomy and triple neurectomy. Case presentation: A 65 -year-old man was referred to our department because of chronic right orchialgia following Lichtenstein hernia repair. He walked with a limp and was unable to walk a long distance. Physical examination revealed the presence of meshoma in the groin area and hypoesthesia in the anterior skin of the right scrotum. His right testis was completely atrophic and located not in the scrotum but in the subcutaneous regions of right groin. He was diagnosed as both neuropathic and nociceptive orchialgia and underwent meshoma removal, triple-neurectomy, and orchiectomy to address these issues. Pathological examination revealed that meshoma was integrated with the structures of the spermatic cord, leading to foreign-body reaction and fibrosis around the genital branch of genitofemoral nerve. The resected right testis was completely-scarred without ischemic changes. Orchialgia disappeared immediately after operation {{and he was able to}} walk without a limp. Discussions: It is important to distinguish between nociceptive and neuropathic orchialgia. Neuroanatomic understanding is essential to guide treatment options. Orchiectomy is an option but should be reserved for refractory cases with evidence of nociceptive pain accompanied by anatomical changes. Conclusions: Triple neurectomy should be considered in patients with neuropathic orchialgia...|$|E
40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{physiology of}} the Pacific white-sided dolphin, Lagenorhynchus obliquidens, was characterized {{to facilitate the}} development of artificial insemination (AI) using cryopreserved spermatozoa. Specific objectives were to: 1) describe reproductive seasonality of the Pacific white sided dolphins; 2) describe urinary LH and ovarian steroid metabolites during the estrous cycle; 3) correlate LH and ovarian steroidal metabolite patterns to ultrasound-monitored follicular growth and ovulation; and 4) assess the efficacy of synchronizing estrus, sperm collection/cryopreservation, and intrauterine insemination. Ovulations (64 %, n= 37) and conceptions (83 %, n= 18) occurred from August to October. Peak mean serum testosterone (24 ng/ml), cross-sectional <b>testicular</b> <b>area</b> (41. 6 cm 2), and sperm concentration (144. 3 × 107 sperm/ml) occurred in July, August, and September respectively. Spermatozoa were only found in ejaculates from July to October. Estrous cycles (n= 22) were 31 d long and were comprised of a 10 d follicular and 21 d luteal phase. Ovulation occurred 31. 2 h after {{the onset of the}} LH surge and 19. 3 h after the LH peak. Follicular diameter and circumference within 12 h of ovulation were 1. 52 and 4. 66 cm respectively. Estrus synchronization attempts with altrenogest resulted in 17 (22 %) ovulatory cycles with ovulation occurring 21 d post-altrenogest. Ten AI attempts using cryopreserved semen resulted in five pregnancies (50 %). The mean gestation length was 356 days (range 348 – 367). These data provide new information on the Pacific whitesided dolphin’s reproductive physiology and collectively enabled the first application of AI in this species...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of gonadal maturation and nesting {{success of the}} anemone fish Amphiprion ocellaris was analyzed through mating system removal. Four experiments viz., (i) Sex change of active male to female {{in the absence of}} active female, (ii) Juveniles {{in the presence of a}} functional male that was changing sex from male to female, (iii) Juvenile in the presence of a functional female, and (iv) Same length group juvenile fishes (total length: 50 mm) without the presence of adult fishes, were carried out. The gonad of male in experiment (i) showed first perceptible sign of sex inversion after 1 to 2 weeks. After 25 weeks the testicular zone almost disappeared and the gonad looked like maturing ovary with perivitellogenic oocytes and oocytes at various stages of development. The gonad of juveniles in the second experiment showed increased testicular development after 23 to 24 weeks, and <b>testicular</b> <b>area</b> became clearly discernible after 30 weeks. In the third experiment, the gonad of juvenile completed its spermatogenesis after 15 to 16 weeks and showed well-developed testicular zones. In the fourth experiment, the gonad of largest fish showed development of ovarian part after 24 weeks with oogonia and oocytes at various stages, and degeneration of testicular tissues. The observation of nesting success in the above experimental groups showed that spawning was obtained in the third group after 4 months of association; and after 12 to 18 months in the first and second groups, and after 20 to 24 months in the fourth group. The present study shows that in the absence or disappearance of adult female, the active male changes sex to female within a period of 25 weeks. The study also confirms that in the clownfish A. ocellaris, the largest and socially dominant fish in a host sea anemone (Heteractis magnifica) is generally female, whose gonads are functional ovaries with remnants of degenerated testicular tissues. The second largest fish in the same group is an active male and has gonad that are functioning testis but also possess non-functioning or latent ovarian cells (ovotestis). If the dominant female dies or is experimentally removed from the "queue", the male not only changes sex but also grows at an accelerated rate, and the juveniles also grow faster to become male and fill the size gap of the social group. This adaptation allows continuous reproduction. It is found that social structure plays an important role on the sex changing mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The {{handling}} and reporting of testicular tumours is difficult {{due to their}} rarity. METHODS AND RESULTS: A survey developed by the European Network of Uro-Pathology (ENUP) and sent to its members and experts to assess the evaluation of testicular germ cell tumours. Twenty-five experts and 225 ENUP members replied. Areas of disagreement included immaturity in teratomas, reported by 32 % of experts but 68 % of ENUP. Although the presence of rete testis invasion was reported widely, the distinction between pagetoid and stromal invasion was made by 96 % of experts but only 63 % of ENUP. Immunohistochemistry was used in more than 50 % of cases by 68 % of ENUP and 12 % of experts. Staging revealed the greatest areas of disagreement. Invasion of the tunica vaginalis without vascular invasion was interpreted as T 1 by 52 % of experts and 67 % of ENUP, but T 2 by the remainder. Tumour invading the hilar adipose tissue adjacent to the epididymis without vascular invasion was interpreted as T 1 : 40 % of experts, 43 % of ENUP; T 2 : 36 % of experts, 30 % of ENUP; and T 3 : 24 % of experts, 27 % of ENUP.

50|$|In men, as in women, {{there are}} a number of {{physical}} factors that may cause sexual discomfort. Pain is sometimes experienced in the <b>testicular</b> or glans <b>area</b> of the penis immediately after ejaculation. Infections of the prostate, bladder, or seminal vesicles can lead to intense burning or itching sensations following ejaculation. Men suffering from interstitial cystitis may experience intense pain at the moment of ejaculation. Gonorrheal infections are sometimes associated with burning or sharp penile pains during ejaculation. Urethritis or prostatitis can make genital stimulation painful or uncomfortable. Anatomic deformities of the penis, such as exist in Peyronie's disease, may also result in pain during coitus. One cause of painful intercourse is due to the painful retraction of a too-tight foreskin, occurring either during the first attempt at intercourse or subsequent to tightening or scarring following inflammation or local infection. Another cause of painful intercourse is due to tension in a short and slender frenulum, frenulum breve, as the foreskin retracts on entry to the vagina irrespective of lubrication. In one study frenulum breve was found in 50% of patients who presented with dyspareunia. During vigorous or deep or tight intercourse or masturbation, small tears may occur in the frenum of the foreskin and can bleed and be very painful and induce anxiety, which can become chronic if left unresolved. If stretching fails to ease the condition, and uncomfortable levels of tension remain, a frenuloplasty procedure may be recommended. Frenuloplasty is an effective procedure, with a high chance of avoiding circumcision, giving good functional results and patient satisfaction. The psychological effects of these conditions, while little understood, are real, and are visible in literature and art.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study the {{postnatal}} development of the testis of 67 male cats was examined. The youngest cats were neonatal, the oldest ones had been castrated {{at the age of}} 12 months. Apart from investigating the morphology by light- and electron-microscopic methods, the growth of some of the tissues´ components (for example the area of the seminiferous tubules) were recorded morphometrically. In addition, the concentration of testosterone in the animals´ plasma was measured. These investigations give an overview of the structures of the cats´ testis at different ages and point out influences of parts of the organ depend on each other during their development. This is supported by comparison of the morphology, the morphometric parameters and the concentration of testosterone in the plasma. At birth, moderately coiled, solid germinal cords {{can be found in the}} testis of the cat. They have a single-layered epithelium, which contains mainly SERTOLI cells and only a few germinal cells. The intertubular tissue is loose, containing LEYDIG cells. These cells also occur in great number underneath and in between the tunica albuginea, where they are named "heterotopic LEYDIG cells". From the age of 4 months on the formation of a lumen starts in the peripheral situated seminiferous tubules and from 4 ? months on they build a stratified germinal epithelium, leading on spermatogenesis. The germinal cord in the centre remain solid for a longer time and spermatogenesis starts later. After 7 - 8 months spermatogenesis covers all tubules. All quantitative parameters (<b>testicular</b> weight, <b>area</b> of tubules, area of parenchyma, etc.) except the testosterone concentration in the plasma increase abruptly in the 20 th week of life. SERTOLI cells in neonatal cats already have a high level of maturity. From the 4 th month on they play a leading role in forming the tubular lumen. Two kinds of SERTOLI cells can be distinguished: the dark type shows features that indicate a high metabolic activity, but they also seem to degenerate more often. The light type occurs much more often and shows characteristics also described in other species. The blood-testis barrier was demonstrated by fixation, containing lanthanum nitrate. The barrier is established from the 4 th month on and apart from SERTOLI cells it is also maintained by testicular blood vessels, which are not permeable to lanthanum nitrate. The myofibroblasts of the lamina limitans contain contractile filaments from the 2 nd month of life on and they are surrounded by an incomplete basement membrane. From the beginning of the investigated period the intertubular as well as the heterotopic LEYDIG cells show all characteristics of steroid hormone production. In the blood plasma testosterone is first detectable in the 10 th week of life and the concentration does not increases until the 26 th week, which seems inconsistent with other quantitative and qualitative features. The particularities of the cats testis and its development are part of the discussion. In addition the discrepancy between the morphological degree of maturation of LEYDIG cells and of the parenchyma and the testosterone levels in plasma as well as the regional differences within the testis in connection with the heterotopic LEYDIG cells, typical of the cat, are discussed...|$|R
