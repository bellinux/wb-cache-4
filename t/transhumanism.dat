5|$|The script of Human Revolution {{was written}} by Mary DeMarle, who was {{narrative}} director and main writer. While she did act as chief writer, DeMarle also worked {{on a number of}} other people throughout development so the story could be conveyed through environments and dialogue, along with handling how its progression was influenced by player choices. Sheldon Pacotti, main writer for the first two Deus Ex titles, was brought in as story consultant during the early stages, and was also contacted regularly through production to ensure that the storyline fitted properly within the series chronology. A total of four writers worked on the game, including author James Swallow. DeMarle was brought onto the project four months into its development, after it had been decided that it would be prequel to the first game, focusing on mechanical rather than nanotechnological enhancement technology. As part of her research, DeMarle looked up multiple subjects, from speculated conspiracy theories to the current level of biotechnology: the final story was influenced in large part by her reading of non-fiction and writings concerning <b>transhumanism.</b> DeMarle compared the game's study of <b>transhumanism</b> through main character Adam to that in the 1982 film Blade Runner, while also using the video game medium to put questions surrounding the ethics and motivations surrounding <b>transhumanism</b> in a nuanced way. She also stated that Adam being forced to confront these issues in person was the narrative's central irony, something that had previously been explored using different narrative elements in Deus Ex. The ending, which was ultimately decided using a choice of buttons, was chosen because of technical and time constraints while retaining player interaction. While the gameplay evolved continually through development and some elements required cutting, the story remained almost unchanged, instead being further refined and improved to work out plot holes.|$|E

2500|$|Transhumanists {{engage in}} {{interdisciplinary}} approaches {{to understand and}} evaluate possibilities for overcoming biological limitations by drawing on futurology and various fields of ethics. Unlike many philosophers, social critics and activists who place a moral value on preservation of natural systems, transhumanists see {{the very concept of}} the specifically natural as problematically nebulous at best and an obstacle to progress at worst. In keeping with this, many prominent transhumanist advocates, such as [...] Dan Agin, refer to <b>transhumanism's</b> critics, on the political right and left jointly, as [...] "bioconservatives" [...] or [...] "bioluddites", the latter term alluding to the 19th century anti-industrialisation social movement that opposed the replacement of human manual labourers by machines.|$|R
2500|$|Other critics target {{what they}} claim to be an {{instrumental}} conception {{of the human body}} in the writings of Marvin Minsky, Hans Moravec and some other transhumanists. Reflecting a strain of feminist criticism of the transhumanist program, philosopher Susan Bordo points to [...] "contemporary obsessions with slenderness, youth and physical perfection", which she sees as affecting both men and women, but in distinct ways, as [...] "the logical (if extreme) manifestations of anxieties and fantasies fostered by our culture." [...] Some critics question other social implications of the movement's focus on body modification. Political scientist Klaus-Gerd Giesen, in particular, has asserted that <b>transhumanism's</b> concentration on altering the human body represents the logical yet tragic consequence of atomized individualism and body commodification within a consumer culture.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Transhumanism's</b> {{assertion}} that the human being exist within the evolutionary processes and that humans should use their technological capabilities to intentionally accelerate these processes is an affront to some conceptions of Imago Dei within Christian tradition. In response, these traditions have erected boundaries {{in order to establish}} the appropriate use of trashumanisic technologies using the distinction between therapeutic and [...] technologies. Therapeutic uses of technology such as cochlear implants, prosthetic limbs, and psychotropic drugs have become commonly accepted in religious circles as means of addressing human frailty. Nevertheless, these acceptable technologies {{can also be used to}} elevate human ability. Further, they correct the human form according to a constructed sense of normalcy. Thus the distinction between therapy and enhancement is ultimately questionable when addressing ethical dilemmas.|$|R
25|$|It is {{a matter}} of debate whether <b>transhumanism</b> is a branch of posthumanism and how this {{philosophical}} movement should be conceptualised with regard to <b>transhumanism.</b> The latter {{is often referred to as}} a variant or activist form of posthumanism by its conservative, Christian and progressive critics.|$|E
25|$|The first {{dialogue}} between <b>transhumanism</b> and faith was a one-day conference {{held at the}} University of Toronto in 2004. Religious critics alone faulted the philosophy of <b>transhumanism</b> as offering no eternal truths nor {{a relationship with the}} divine. They commented that a philosophy bereft of these beliefs leaves humanity adrift in a foggy sea of postmodern cynicism and anomie. Transhumanists responded that such criticisms reflect a failure to look at the actual content of the transhumanist philosophy, which, far from being cynical, is rooted in optimistic, idealistic attitudes that trace back to the Enlightenment. Following this dialogue, William Sims Bainbridge, a sociologist of religion, conducted a pilot study, published in the Journal of Evolution and Technology, suggesting that religious attitudes were negatively correlated with acceptance of transhumanist ideas and indicating that individuals with highly religious worldviews tended to perceive <b>transhumanism</b> as being a direct, competitive (though ultimately futile) affront to their spiritual beliefs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transhumanism</b> (abbreviated as H+ or h+) is an {{international}} intellectual movement that aims to transform the human condition by developing and making widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly enhance human intellect and physiology.|$|E
25|$|Optimistic {{assumptions}} {{are made by}} proponents of ideologies such as <b>transhumanism</b> and singularitarianism, which view technological development as generally having beneficial effects for the society and the human condition. In these ideologies, technological development is morally good.|$|E
25|$|The {{philosophy}} of <b>transhumanism</b> {{is closely related}} to technoself studies, an interdisciplinary domain of scholarly research dealing with all aspects of human identity in a technological society and focusing on the changing nature of relationships between humans and technology.|$|E
25|$|Viewed {{from the}} {{perspective}} of some Christian thinkers, the idea of mind uploading is asserted to represent a denigration of the human body, characteristic of gnostic manichaean belief. <b>Transhumanism</b> and its presumed intellectual progenitors have also been described as neo-gnostic by non-Christian and secular commentators.|$|E
25|$|Transhumanist themes {{have become}} {{increasingly}} prominent in various literary forms during {{the period in which}} the movement itself has emerged. Contemporary science fiction often contains positive renditions of technologically enhanced human life set in utopian (especially techno-utopian) societies. However, science fiction's depictions of enhanced humans or other posthuman beings frequently come with a cautionary twist. The more pessimistic scenarios include many horrific or dystopian tales of human bioengineering gone wrong. In the decades immediately before <b>transhumanism</b> emerged as an explicit movement, many transhumanist concepts and themes began appearing in the speculative fiction of authors of the Golden Age of Science Fiction such as Robert A. Heinlein (Lazarus Long series, 1941–87), A. E. van Vogt (Slan, 1946), Isaac Asimov (I, Robot, 1950), Arthur C. Clarke (Childhood's End, 1953) and Stanisław Lem (Cyberiad, 1967). C. S. Lewis' That Hideous Strength (1945) contains an early critique of <b>transhumanism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Philosophical debates {{have arisen}} {{over the use}} of technology, with {{disagreements}} over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as <b>transhumanism</b> and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.|$|E
25|$|Robot {{designer}} Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil {{have predicted}} that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called <b>transhumanism,</b> which has roots in Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger, has been illustrated in fiction as well, for example in the manga Ghost in the Shell and the science-fiction series Dune.|$|E
25|$|A {{belief of}} counter-transhumanism is that <b>transhumanism</b> can cause unfair human {{enhancement}} {{in many areas}} of life, but specifically on the social plane. This can be compared to steroid use, where athletes who use steroids in sports have an advantage over those who do not. The same scenario happens when people have certain neural implants that give them an advantage in the work place and in educational aspects.|$|E
25|$|Although {{generally}} {{sympathetic to}} <b>transhumanism,</b> public health professor Gregory Stock is {{skeptical of the}} technical feasibility and mass appeal of the cyborgization of humanity predicted by Raymond Kurzweil, Hans Moravec and Kevin Warwick. He said that, throughout the 21st century, many humans would find themselves deeply integrated into systems of machines, but would remain biological. Primary changes to their own form and character would arise not from cyberware, but from the direct manipulation of their genetics, metabolism and biochemistry.|$|E
25|$|Aarni's music bears {{similarities}} to funeral doom metal (in Reaching Azathoth, for example) and has sometimes {{similarities to}} folk metal (The Weird of Vipunen). Their style {{has been described}} as almost orthodox doom metallish Lovecraftian-Jungian Kalevala avantgarde music. The band themselves sometimes use the term Chthonic Musick. The lyrics of Aarni include varied themes such as Finnish folklore, <b>transhumanism,</b> Lovecraft, paganism, parapsychology, psychoanalytical theories and mythology. The lyrics have been sung in English, Finnish, Latin, and occasionally in Enochian, Ancient Egyptian, Ouranian Barbaric, Swedish, and Glossolalic.|$|E
25|$|While many transhumanist {{theorists and}} advocates seek to apply reason, science and {{technology}} {{for the purposes of}} reducing poverty, disease, disability and malnutrition around the globe, <b>transhumanism</b> is distinctive in its particular focus on the applications of technologies to the improvement of human bodies at the individual level. Many transhumanists actively assess the potential for future technologies and innovative social systems {{to improve the quality of}} all life, while seeking to make the material reality of the human condition fulfill the promise of legal and political equality by eliminating congenital mental and physical barriers.|$|E
25|$|The Talos Principle {{bore out}} from Croteam's work towards first-person shooter Serious Sam 4, experimenting {{with the use}} of {{interactive}} objects as part of the game design while creating levels that fit within the Serious Sam design style. This led to some complicated puzzles that the team was inspired to build upon further as a separate title. Croteam designed the general world setting and outline of the story, and then brought two writers on board, Tom Jubert and Jonas Kyratzes, who consulted on narrative design and philosophy on the bases of <b>transhumanism</b> and other important questions about humanity.|$|E
25|$|Some secular humanists {{conceive}} <b>transhumanism</b> as an {{offspring of}} the humanist freethought movement {{and argue that}} transhumanists differ from the humanist mainstream by having a specific focus on technological approaches to resolving human concerns (i.e. technocentrism) and {{on the issue of}} mortality. However, other progressives have argued that posthumanism, whether it be its philosophical or activist forms, amounts to a shift away from concerns about social justice, from the reform of human institutions and from other Enlightenment preoccupations, toward narcissistic longings for a transcendence of the human body in quest of more exquisite ways of being.|$|E
25|$|Transhumanists do not {{necessarily}} rule out specific restrictions on emerging technologies so as to lessen the prospect of existential risk. Generally, however, they counter that proposals based on the precautionary principle are often unrealistic and sometimes even counter-productive {{as opposed to the}} technogaian current of <b>transhumanism,</b> which they claim is both realistic and productive. In his television series Connections, science historian James Burke dissects several views on technological change, including precautionism and the restriction of open inquiry. Burke questions the practicality of some of these views, but concludes that maintaining the status quo of inquiry and development poses hazards of its own, such as a disorienting rate of change and the depletion of our planet's resources. The common transhumanist position is a pragmatic one where society takes deliberate action to ensure the early arrival of the benefits of safe, clean, alternative technology, rather than fostering what it considers to be anti-scientific views and technophobia.|$|E
500|$|Some {{philosophers}} {{of biology}} such as James G. Lennox {{have argued that}} Darwin was a teleologist, while others like Michael Ghiselin described this claim as a myth promoted by misinterpretations of his discussions, and emphasized the distinction between using teleological metaphors and actually being teleological. Andrew Askland, from the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law claims that unlike <b>transhumanism,</b> an ideology that aims to improve the human condition, which he asserts is [...] "wholly teleological", Darwinian evolution is not teleological.|$|E
500|$|Set in {{the year}} 2027, Human Revolution focuses on ex-SWAT officer Adam Jensen, who is {{employed}} as security officer for Sarif Industries, a company {{on the leading edge}} of advanced and controversial artificial organs dubbed [...] "augmentations". An attack on Sarif Industries that apparently kills researcher and Adam's ex-girlfriend Megan Reed also leaves Adam critically injured. To save him, company CEO David Sarif subjects him to an extensive augmentation procedure: six months later, now recovered and possessing advanced augmentations, Adam sets out to pursue his attackers and the shadowy organization behind them. The story explores themes of <b>transhumanism,</b> the growing power of megacorporations, and their impact on social class. It also uses the series' recurring cyberpunk setting and conspiracy theory motif.|$|E
500|$|In a 2012 {{article for}} The New York Observer, {{journalist}} Jessica Roy characterized Fucking Machines' examples of orgasms {{as a form}} of <b>transhumanism.</b> In the book Screening the Dark Side of Love: From Euro-Horror to American Cinema (2012), Sarah Schaschek devoted a chapter to the phenomenon, titled [...] "Fucking Machines: High-Tech Bodies in Pornography". Schaschek concluded, [...] "While antipornography feminists usually criticize that female performers are visually and practically degraded by men in heterosexual pornography, it is hard to uphold such an impression in the FuckingMachines videos. Given that all pornography eroticizes difference, and given that sexual fantasies usually require clearly drawn roles of dominance and submission, the women of FuckingMachines seem to resist at least a few of these categories.... Strictly speaking, the women in these videos are both the controllers and the controlled." ...|$|E
500|$|The website {{has been}} the subject of {{attention}} from journalists and academics studying sexuality. Writer Regina Lynn highlighted the site's emphasis on communication, and Annalee Newitz of AlterNet classed it as part of Porn 2.0. Violet Blue wrote in The Adventurous Couple's Guide to Sex Toys that it helped popularize the idea of machines aiding in sex acts. The 2008 edition of The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History described the aesthetic of the devices as disturbing. Jessica Roy wrote for The New York Observer that Fucking Machines' examples of orgasms were a form of <b>transhumanism.</b> Sarah Schaschek devoted a chapter to the phenomenon in Screening the Dark Side of Love: From Euro-Horror to American Cinema, titled [...] "Fucking Machines: High-Tech Bodies in Pornography".

500|$|To expand {{this into}} a book, Weisman's agent found an editor and {{publisher}} at St. Martin's Press. Among the 23-page bibliography are two articles he wrote for the Los Angeles Times Magazine ("Naked Planet" [...] on persistent organic pollutants, and [...] "The Real Indiana Jones" [...] on the Mayan civilization) and one published in the Condé Nast Traveler ("Diamond in the Wild" [...] on diamond mining), as well as Discovers [...] "Earth Without People". Additional research saw Weisman travel to England, Cyprus, Turkey, Panama, and Kenya. Interviews with academics quoted in the book include biologist E. O. Wilson on the Korean Demilitarized Zone, archaeologist William Rathje on plastics in garbage, forest botanist Oliver Rackham on vegetative cover across Britain, anthropologist Arthur Demarest on the crash of Mayan civilization, paleobiologist Douglas Erwin on evolution, and philosopher Nick Bostrom on <b>Transhumanism.</b>|$|E
500|$|Breaking {{from the}} theme of the natural {{environment}} after humans, Weisman considers what could lead to the sudden, complete demise of humans without serious damage to the built and natural environment. That scenario, he concludes, is extremely unlikely. He also considers <b>transhumanism,</b> the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement, the Church of Euthanasia and John A. Leslie's The End of the World: the Science and Ethics of Human Extinction. Weisman concludes the book considering {{a new version of the}} one-child policy. While he admits it is a [...] "draconian measure", he states, [...] "The bottom line is that any species that overstretches its resource base suffers a population crash. Limiting our reproduction would be damn hard, but limiting our consumptive instincts may be even harder." [...] He responded to criticism of this saying [...] "I knew in advance that I would touch some people's sensitive spots by bringing up the population issue, but I did so because it's been missing too long from the discussion of how we must deal with the situation our economic and demographic growth have driven us too (sic)".|$|E
2500|$|The {{biologist}} Julian Huxley {{is generally}} regarded as the founder of <b>transhumanism,</b> after using the term {{for the title of}} an influential 1957 article. The term itself, however, derives from an earlier 1940 paper by the Canadian philosopher W. D. Lighthall. [...] Huxley describes <b>transhumanism</b> in these terms: ...|$|E

2500|$|A common {{feature of}} <b>transhumanism</b> and {{philosophical}} posthumanism {{is the future}} vision of a new intelligent species, into which humanity will evolve and eventually will supplement or supersede it. <b>Transhumanism</b> stresses the evolutionary perspective, including sometimes {{the creation of a}} highly intelligent animal species by way of cognitive enhancement (i.e. biological uplift), but clings to a [...] "posthuman future" [...] as the final goal of participant evolution.|$|E
2500|$|The {{very notion}} and {{prospect}} of human enhancement and related issues arouse public controversy. Criticisms of <b>transhumanism</b> and its proposals take two main forms: those objecting to {{the likelihood of}} transhumanist goals being achieved (practical criticisms) and those objecting to the moral principles or worldview sustaining transhumanist proposals or underlying <b>transhumanism</b> itself (ethical criticisms). Critics and opponents often see transhumanists' goals as posing threats to human values.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, {{the idea}} of {{creating}} intelligent artificial beings (proposed, for example, by roboticist Hans Moravec) has influenced <b>transhumanism.</b> Moravec's ideas and <b>transhumanism</b> have also been characterised [...] as a [...] "complacent" [...] or [...] "apocalyptic" [...] variant of posthumanism and contrasted with [...] "cultural posthumanism" [...] in humanities and the arts. While such a [...] "cultural posthumanism" [...] would offer resources for rethinking the relationships between humans and increasingly sophisticated machines, <b>transhumanism</b> and similar posthumanisms are, in this view, not abandoning obsolete concepts of the [...] "autonomous liberal subject", but are expanding its [...] "prerogatives" [...] into the realm of the posthuman. Transhumanist self-characterisations as a continuation of humanism and Enlightenment thinking correspond with this view.|$|E
