5|$|After VE Day, Ismay {{accompanied}} Churchill to the Potsdam Conference. Like Yalta, {{the conference}} focussed primarily on political issues, {{so there was}} little for Ismay <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>After</b> Clement Attlee defeated Churchill in the 1945 election, becoming Prime Minister, Ismay kept his position, working with Attlee at the conference, but remained loyal to Churchill. Ismay and Churchill remained friends {{for the remainder of}} their lives, and Ismay even helped Churchill write his memoirs, reviewing and commenting on each chapter of his manuscript.|$|E
5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} in March 44 BC. The motives of the conspirators were both personal, as well as political. Many of Caesar's {{ultimate}} assassins were envious of him, and dissatisfied with the recognition that they had received from him. Most of the conspirators were senators, {{and many of them}} were angry {{about the fact that he}} had deprived the senate of much of its power and prestige. They were also angry that, while they had received few honors, Caesar had been given many honors. There were also rumors that he was going to make himself king, and transfer the seat of government to Alexandria. The grievances that they held against him were vague, and as such, their plan against him was vague. The fact that their motives were vague, and that they had no idea of what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>after</b> his assassination, both were plainly obvious by the subsequent course of events.|$|E
5|$|The Cottage was {{originally}} developed in 1977–1978 by three children: brothers Viggo Kann (then Eriksson) and Kimmo Eriksson, and their friend Olle Johansson, {{who at the}} time of the project's start were ten, twelve and fourteen years old, respectively. As Viggo and Kimmo's parents worked at Stockholms Datamaskincentral ("Stockholm's Computer Center", QZ) and the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), and Johansson's father worked at an office that was a client for QZ, they had access to QZ's DEC-10 mainframe computer Oden. Using Oden and the book What <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>After</b> You Hit Return (1975), the Eriksson brothers and Johansson learned programming.|$|E

5|$|The {{diplomatic}} context at Constance {{included the}} revolt of the Bohemian Hussites, who looked upon Poland {{as an ally}} in their wars against Sigismund, the emperor elect and new king of Bohemia. In 1421, the Bohemian Diet declared Sigismund deposed and formally offered the crown to Władysław on condition that he accept the religious principles of the Four Articles of Prague, which he was not prepared <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>After</b> Władysław's refusal, Vytautas was postulated (elected in absentia) as Bohemian king, but he assured the pope that he opposed the heretics. Between 1422 and 1428, Władysław's nephew, Sigismund Korybut, attempted a regency in war-torn Bohemia, with little success. Vytautas accepted Sigismund's offer of a royal crown in 1429 — apparently with Władysław's blessing — but Polish forces intercepted the crown in transit and the coronation was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|When the {{children}} that work for the Vulture are discussing what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>after</b> Superior Spider-Man (Otto Octavius's mind in Spider-Man's body) brutally defeats the Vulture, the Green Goblin approaches them and tells them {{that he will be}} the one that crushes Superior Spider-Man. Green Goblin is later shown having gathered a new gang of followers together in the sewers formed from discarded members of other villains' gangs like Vulture, Owl and the third White Dragon's gangs. These henchmen escaped their organizations unharmed because Superior Spider-Man is more focused on the larger threats (where the original Spider-Man would focus on individuals).|$|E
5|$|While {{fighting}} the Lydians, Cyrus had sent {{messages to the}} Ionians asking them to revolt against Lydian rule, which the Ionians had refused <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>After</b> Cyrus completed the conquest of Lydia, the Ionian cities now offered to be his subjects under the same terms {{as they had been}} subjects of Croesus. Cyrus refused, citing the Ionians' unwillingness to help him previously. The Ionians thus prepared to defend themselves, and Cyrus sent the Median general Harpagus to conquer Ionia. He first attacked Phocaea; the Phocaeans decided to entirely abandon their city and sail into exile in Sicily, rather than become Persian subjects (although many subsequently returned). Some Teians also chose to emigrate when Harpagus attacked Teos, {{but the rest of the}} Ionians remained, and were in turn conquered.|$|E

5|$|While the Grand Prince is away in Lithuania, his power-hungry {{younger brother}} forms an {{allegiance}} {{with a group}} of Tatars and raids Vladimir. We see flashbacks of the Grand Prince and his brother attending a religious service in the church, and see the rivalry and animosity between them. The invasion of the combined armed forces on horseback and the resulting carnage is shown in great detail. The city is burned, the citizens are murdered and women raped and killed. One scene shows a horse falling from a flight of stairs and being stabbed by a spear. Another shows a cow being set on fire. Foma narrowly escapes being killed in the city and escapes into the nearby countryside, but as he is crossing a river he is shot in the back with an arrow and killed. The Tatars force their way into the barricaded church, now fully decorated with Andrei's paintings, where the majority of the citizens have taken refuge. The Tatars show no mercy and massacre the people inside and burn all the painted wooden altarpieces. Andrei saves Durochka from being raped by killing a Tatar with an axe. The Bishop's messenger is cruelly tortured to make him reveal the location of the city's gold, which he refuses <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>After</b> being repeatedly burned, he has liquid metal from a melted crucifix poured into his mouth and is dragged away tied to a horse. In the aftermath only Andrei and Durochka are left alive in the church. Andrei imagines a conversation with the dead Theophanes the Greek, lamenting the loss of his work and the evil of mankind, while Durochka distractedly plaits the hair of a dead woman. Andrei decides to give up painting and takes a vow of silence to atone for killing another man.|$|E

25|$|His successor, Prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, was proclaimed Domnitor as Carol I of Romania on 20 April 1866. The {{election}} of a foreign prince with ties to an important princely house, legitimizing Romanian independence (which Carol came <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>after</b> the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878), {{had been one of}} the liberal aims in the revolution of 1848.|$|E

England left too much <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>after</b> the defeat by Italy {{to qualify for the}} World Cup, but Hughes nonetheless celebrated a 50th cap when England beat the Italians 2–0 in the final qualifier at Wembley at the end of 1977.|$|E

Shivaji had {{great respect for}} other contemporary saints, especially Samarth Ramdas, to whom he gave the fort of Parali, later renamed as 'Sajjangad'. Among the various poems written on Shivaji, Ramdas' Shivastuti ("Praise of King Shivaji") is the most famous. Shivaji's son Sambhaji later built a samadhi for Ramdas Swami on Sajjangad upon the latter's death. Samarth Ramdas had also written a letter to Sambhaji guiding him {{on what to do}} and what not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>after</b> death of Shivaji.|$|E
25|$|Langer {{through to}} the end of his career {{remained}} publicly undecided about what he wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>after</b> his retirement. Speculation hence rose in the media with suggestions of a coaching position with Middlesex, and an open invitation to return to Somerset in some capacity. In November 2009, Cricket Australia announced the appointment of Langer as assistant coach of their Test team under national boss Tim Nielsen, as a batting coach and mentor. In November 2012, Langer was appointed to the position of senior coach of Western Australia and the Perth Scorchers, after the resignation of Lachlan Stevens, with a contract until the end of the 2015–16 season.|$|E
25|$|The Wicked Witch {{successfully}} tricks Dorothy {{out of one}} of her Silver Shoes. Angered, Dorothy {{throws a}} bucket of water at her and is shocked to see the witch melt away. The Winkies rejoice at being freed of the witch's tyranny and help restuff the Scarecrow and mend the Tin Woodman. They ask the Tin Woodman to become their ruler, which he agrees <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>after</b> helping Dorothy return to Kansas. Dorothy finds the Golden Cap and summons the Winged Monkeys to carry her and her companions back to the Emerald City. The King of the Winged Monkeys tells how he and the other monkeys are bound by an enchantment to the cap by the sorceress Gayelette from the North, and that Dorothy may use the cap to summon the Winged Monkeys two more times.|$|E

25|$|The school's mascot is an Indian. In 2004, {{there was}} a major {{controversy}} at the school about the appropriateness of the mascot. The school took up the issue after researching high schools and colleges around the U.S. with similar nicknames that had decided to change their mascots. Many of these schools had received complaints from Native American groups about the stereotypes that the mascots reinforced. The student council also discussed rumors that New Jersey would be banning Native American-related mascots, and eventually it was decided that taking up the issue by choice rather than force was the right thing <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>After</b> months of public debate and an official symposium in which students voiced opinions {{from both sides of the}} issue, a vote was held among the students and faculty and the motion to keep the Indian was affirmed, 67% voting in favor of keeping the mascot.|$|E
25|$|McIlroy's tough {{schedule}} eventually {{caught up}} with him as he missed the cut at his next two events. First at the BMW PGA Championship, he opened with an average one-under-par 71 but faded the next day to a 6-over 78. He claiming mental fatigue got the better of him and not its physical counterpart. The following week at the Irish Open, McIlroy shot a first round 80 to lie 9-over and in a tie for last place. The following day he managed a level-par 71 around Royal County Down which left him 4 shots off the halfway cut. McIlroy stated he had left himself too much <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>after</b> a poor Thursday performance in front of his home Northern Irish fans and at the event he now hosts. He later said he was looking forward to a break after five tournaments in a row.|$|E
25|$|Hazumu's parents, {{her father}} , {{and her mother}} , are almost always shown {{together}} throughout the series. When Hazumu goes missing after getting rejected from Yasuna, both of Hazumu's parents are completely distraught, and {{do not know what}} <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>After</b> Hazumu's transformation, both parents become overjoyed to have a daughter in place of a son which is shown through their eccentricities. Toru works as a magazine photographer and loves to take pictures of Hazumu any chance he gets; often this is after his wife has already dressed Hazumu in some feminine garment. Additionally, Hazumu's father repeatedly attempts to take a bath with Hazumu, but is always stopped by his wife. Kahoru loves to buy feminine clothes for Hazumu to wear, and buys these clothes without consulting Hazumu herself, though regardless she finds herself wearing them anyway. Directly after Hazumu turned into a girl, her mother even goes ahead and buys her a female school uniform to wear from now on. Hazumu becomes annoyed by her parents' new behavior toward her, and finds trying on her new clothes very tiring. When Hazumu bakes cookies for the first time, Kahoru loves it, but Toru simply wolfs down most of the cookies for himself. Since his mother had always wanted a daughter instead of son, she often dressed Hazumu up in young girl's clothes, saying that gender discrimination is not a good thing.|$|E
