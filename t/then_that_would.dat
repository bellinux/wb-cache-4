5|$|If a photon {{did have}} non-zero mass, {{there would be}} other effects as well. Coulomb's law would be {{modified}} and the electromagnetic field would have an extra physical degree of freedom. These effects yield more sensitive experimental probes of the photon mass than the frequency dependence {{of the speed of}} light. If Coulomb's law is not exactly valid, <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> allow the presence of an electric field to exist within a hollow conductor when it is subjected to an external electric field. This thus allows one to test Coulomb's law to very high precision. A null result of such an experiment has set a limit of m ≲ 10−14eV/c2.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{cited as}} {{authoritative}} National Labor Relations Board v. Bell Oil & Gas Co., 91 F.2d 509 (5 Cir. 1937). If Mackay Radio {{had refused to}} rehire the workers because of anti-union animus, <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be an unfair labor practice, the court held. Reviewing briefly the evidence generated by the Board during the hearings, Justice Roberts concluded that anti-union animus had motivated the employer and thus reinstatement was proper.|$|E
500|$|Nimoy said Meyer {{gave the}} script [...] "the kind {{of humor and}} social comment, gadfly {{attitude}} I very much wanted". He added that his vision was for [...] "no dying, no fighting, no shooting, no photon torpedoes, no phaser blasts, no stereotypical bad guy. I wanted people to really {{have a great time}} watching this film [...] if somewhere in the mix we lobbed a couple of big ideas at them, well, <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be even better." [...] One of Meyer's earlier films, Time After Time, was largely based in San Francisco; when he was told by the producers that The Voyage Home had to be set in the same city, he took the opportunity to comment upon cultural aspects not covered by his earlier film, such as punk rock—The Voyage Homes scene where Kirk and Spock meet an annoying punk rocker was based on a similar scene cut from Time After Time.|$|E

500|$|... "Sweet Life" [...] was raved {{by music}} critics. John Calvert of The Quietus {{described}} the song as [...] "really big. Like R. Kelly's [...] "I Believe I Can Fly" [...] big. Like Superman eating a super hotdog while fighting King Kong while...ok {{you get the}} picture. If you were looking around for a high concept pitch-style descriptor, with its synth brass and Philly soul strings {{you might call it}} 'Stevie Wonder meets N.E.R.D in space'. But <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be too simplistic a definition for the multifaceted, resolutely accomplished 'Sweet Thing'." [...] Pitchforks Larry Fitzmaurice labeled it a [...] "Best New Track" [...] and noted that [...] "this was a week where Frank Ocean bravely invited us to learn more about his personal story; 'Sweet Life' is another reminder of how well he can structure a narrative in the musical realm." [...] The Telegraphs Neil McCormick noted that Ocean took the R genre and pushed it out into strange new places, with tracks like the [...] "blissful, jazzy jigsaw of 'Sweet Life', which seems to assemble itself from disconnected elements as it goes along." [...] AllMusic's Andy Kellman mused that the track served as one of the album's lighter moments, and wrote that [...] "the bright 'Sweet Life' and the relatively exuberant 'Monks,' both of which would be standouts on any N.E.R.D. album, offer more than bright coating, dealing in surrealism and sharp observations that are equally penetrating." ...|$|E
500|$|More recent {{research}} has revealed {{that it was only}} Dr Francisco who told the news people that Elvis apparently died of heart failure. In fact, the doctors [...] "could say nothing with confidence until they got the results back from the laboratories, if <b>then.</b> <b>That</b> <b>would</b> be a matter of weeks." [...] One of the examiners, Dr E. Eric Muirhead [...] "could not believe his ears. Francisco had not only presumed to speak for the hospital's team of pathologists, he had announced a conclusion that they had not reached." [...] "Early on, a meticulous dissection of the body ... confirmed [...] Elvis was chronically ill with diabetes, glaucoma, and constipation. As they proceeded, the doctors saw evidence that his body had been wracked over a span of years by a large and constant stream of drugs. They had also studied his hospital records, which included two admissions for drug detoxification and methadone treatments." [...] Therefore, Frank Coffey is of the opinion that a plausible cause of Elvis' death is [...] "a phenomenon called the Valsalva maneuver (essentially straining on the toilet leading to heart stoppage— plausible because Elvis suffered constipation, a common reaction to drug use)..." [...] In similar terms, Dr Dan Warlick, who was present at the autopsy, [...] "believes Presley's chronic constipation— the result of years of prescription drug abuse and high-fat, high-cholesterol gorging— brought on what's known as Valsalva's maneuver. Put simply, the strain of attempting to defecate compressed the singer's abdominal aorta, shutting down his heart." ...|$|E

2500|$|Current {{research}} on the WSC focuses in on two areas: heat content and methane gas release. It {{has been well documented}} that the Atlantic Water core temperature associated with the WSC has increased by almost 1 °C in recent years. It has also been well documented that the Atlantic Water core temperature decreases as you move cyclonically around the Arctic. Thus, this means that heat is being lost to the surrounding water. As the temperature of the water is increased, more heat will be lost to the surrounding water as the WSC tracts around the Arctic Ocean. If the heat flux out of the Atlantic Water core in the WSC is vertically upward <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> lead to warming of the Arctic Surface Water and the melting of more Arctic Sea Ice. Thus, this current topic is of high interest because an increase of heat flux out of the AW core will result in more Arctic Sea Ice melting.|$|E

2500|$|While {{serving as}} a {{professor}} at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Dembski wrote The End of Christianity, which argued that a Christian can reconcile an old Earth creationist view with a literal reading of Adam and Eve in the Bible by accepting the scientific consensus of a 4.5 billion year of Earth. He further argued that Noah's flood likely was a phenomenon limited to the Middle East. This caused controversy and Dembski's reading of the Bible was criticized by Tom Nettles, a young Earth creationist, in The Southern Baptist Journal of Theology, Southern Seminary's official theological journal. In 2010, the dean of Southwestern's School of Theology, David Allen, [...] "released a White Paper through the seminary's Center for Theological Research defending Dembski as {{within the bounds of}} orthodoxy and critiquing Nettles for misunderstanding the book. The paper included Dembski's statement admitting error regarding Noah's flood." [...] Southwestern Seminary president Paige Patterson, a young Earth creationist, [...] "said that when Dembski's questionable statements came to light, he convened a meeting with Dembski and several high-ranking administrators at the seminary. At that meeting, Dembski was quick to admit that he was wrong about the flood. [...] "'Had I had any inkling that Dr. Dembski was actually denying the absolute trustworthiness of the Bible, <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have, of course, ended his relationship with the school,' he said." ...|$|E
