5|$|On February 25, 1970, the 11 Westinghouse-powered cars {{intended}} for Harrisburg service completed their performance testing. Penn Central {{refused to accept}} <b>the</b> <b>cars,</b> citing numerous technical issues with <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> and their general unsuitability for the service. They had worse acceleration than the Silverliners already in service, tended to overheat when making numerous closely spaced stops, and had difficulty climbing the grade out of Suburban Station. Additionally, the corridor lacked high-level platforms to effectively use <b>the</b> <b>cars,</b> and 15 substations would require expensive modifications. The 11 cars were unused for some time before Penn Central ultimately decided to lease <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> for use on the core New York - Washington service. They were {{moved back to the}} Budd plant for modifications in April. In July, the state authorized $100,000 to upgrade Silverliners for the Harrisburg service instead.|$|E
5|$|Troop kitchens, rolling galleys, {{also joined}} the trains to provide meal service en route (the troops took their meals {{in their seats}} or bunks). As the cooking was {{performed}} by regular U.S. Army cooks, <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> were outfitted with two Army-standard coal ranges. <b>The</b> <b>cars</b> were also equipped {{with a pair of}} 200-gallon cold water tanks and a 40-gallon hot water tank; supplies were stocked on open shelves with marine-type railings, a bread locker, a large refrigerator, and a series of built-in cabinets and drawers. <b>The</b> <b>cars</b> served approximately 250 men each, and were typically placed {{in the middle of the}} train so that food could be served from both ends.|$|E

5|$|After {{the arrival}} of the strikebreakers on the {{afternoon}} of November 2, Indianapolis Police Chief Martin Hyland had mounted city police escort them from Indianapolis Union Station to the company's maintenance and storage carhouses, one block south of the terminal building. The police broke a path through the strikers to allow the strikebreakers into the building so they could prepare to launch <b>the</b> <b>cars.</b> Organized labor leaders held two mass meetings and unions across the city agreed to send additional men to support the strikers against the strikebreakers. A riot began as the strikebreakers attempted to restore transit service. Whenever the strikebreakers launched a streetcar from the storage barns, the strikers attacked them with rocks and brick. They boarded the streetcars, dragged the crews from <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> and lit <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> on fire. Many injuries occurred on both sides and ambulances were called to carry the injured to a hospital. After the destruction of six cars, the strikebreakers abandoned their attempts to restart service.|$|E
5|$|B. From the 2000 season, races stopped {{after two}} laps but before three-quarters race {{distance}} {{had been completed}} would be restarted with <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> lining up on the grid in the order {{they were at the}} end of the penultimate lap before the lap during which the red flag was shown. Only the race order and number of laps completed was taken into account for the new race, time differences between <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> were voided. The distance of the new race was the number of laps remaining from the original races, less three laps.|$|E
5|$|E. When Jos Verstappen stalled his {{car on the}} grid, Race Director Charlie Whiting {{attempted}} to abort the start, a procedure that is carried out when a car is stalled before the lights go out. However, {{the lights went out}} before he had the chance to do so, and as a result the lights afterwards displayed the standard 5 red lights and 3 amber lights. The race was immediately stopped, but the red flag was not displayed until <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> came to the start/finish line. As is the case when a start is aborted, the race was shortened by one lap as <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> were not refuelled, but Verstappen was allowed to regain his original grid position in 15th.|$|E
50|$|The {{aluminum}} frame of <b>the</b> <b>car</b> was badly warped during heat treating in early 1966, eliminating {{any possibility of}} <b>the</b> <b>car</b> racing in <b>the</b> 1966 Indianapolis 500. Work started over again and <b>the</b> <b>car</b> {{was ready for the}} 1967 Indianapolis 500. Parnelli Jones drove <b>the</b> <b>car</b> during tire testing in Phoenix early that year and was impressed with <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> He agreed to drive <b>the</b> <b>car</b> in <b>the</b> Indianapolis 500 after being offered $100,000 and half of any prize money he won.|$|R

500|$|With the J2X-C {{far from}} being {{completely}} developed, Allard Holdings were liquidated {{in the first quarter}} of 1993, and <b>the</b> <b>car</b> was sold to Robs Lamplough for £76,000. <b>The</b> <b>car's</b> lack of straightline speed, due to a combination of undeveloped aerodynamics, the high level of downforce, and the low power of the engine, would restrict <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> racing career even further. After Lamplough had bought <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> he ran <b>the</b> <b>car</b> in <b>the</b> test session for the 1993 24 Hours of Le Mans; however, he was only able to finish 19th overall, and last in <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> category, even lapping slower than four of <b>the</b> GT <b>cars.</b> <b>The</b> <b>car</b> was clocked at just [...] down the Mulsanne Straight, and this led to Lamplough opting to not run in the 24 Hours of Le Mans race. Instead, Lamplough debuted <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> with assistance from Bob Pond Racing, at the ninth round of the IMSA GTP Championship, held at Laguna Seca Raceway; ninth place overall, and last in the GTP category, was the best Lamplough could do with <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> <b>The</b> <b>car</b> never raced again.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>car</b> {{appeared}} resplendent in British racing green, since John Player Special {{had pulled}} out of F1. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> featured 'coke bottle' sidepods, something that would become familiar in the 1980s. However, a serious problem was encountered during testing. Mario Andretti reported that at speed <b>the</b> <b>car</b> behaved very well, but in braking and cornering, where speeds were lower, <b>the</b> <b>car</b> lost downforce alarmingly then regained it unexpectedly. It was discovered <b>the</b> <b>car</b> was generating too much downforce for the driver to cope with. The problem was twofold: firstly, the ground effect's low pressure area under <b>the</b> <b>car</b> was moving around with <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> centre of gravity. The phenomenon was known as porpoising, as <b>the</b> <b>car</b> appeared to be lifting and squatting at different speeds, causing it to lurch violently through corners. Secondly, the slightest difference in track ride height including off cambered corners, kerbs, etc. affected the undercar pressure hugely. The team experimented by fitting <b>the</b> <b>car</b> with wings, but this {{had little effect on}} <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> <b>car</b> behaved. Andretti persevered with <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> but his new team mate Carlos Reutemann refused to drive it and stayed with the Lotus 79.|$|R

5|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In {{is modeled}} after a 1950s {{drive-in}} theater. The entrance {{is made to}} look like a box office, and guests can walk from there along a tall fence to the dining room, where they sit at formica countertops in booths {{made to look like}} convertibles from the 1940s and 1950s. These booths were designed by Walt Disney Imagineering and are made of fiberglass with much chrome plating. <b>The</b> <b>cars</b> have whitewall tires, and speakers are mounted on poles next to each car. The license plates are dated from 1955, and each convertible seats four people, although these mock vehicles were initially six-seaters when the restaurant first opened. There are six picnic tables near {{the back of the room}} that are only used when the rest of the restaurant is full and there are guests who are willing to forego the experience of sitting in <b>the</b> <b>cars.</b> All guests who make reservations are seated in <b>the</b> <b>cars,</b> although this was not the case the year the restaurant first opened. The restaurant has a total seating capacity of 260.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cars</b> had an aluminium-alloy {{double-skinned}} construction, {{and were}} delivered unpainted to save time. A red adhesive strip {{ran through the}} length of <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> in the middle to match the operator's visual branding. The unpainted cars had a shiny appearance upon delivery, but as dirt and grime accumulated it became a recurring problem for the operator and attracted several public complaints. In response, MRT Corporation built a wash machine at Bishan Depot {{in an attempt to}} clean up the cars' exterior proper. After refurbishment, the problem was solved by covering the cars' exterior entirely with giant stickers, creating a livery that is similar to the newer C751B and C151A rolling stocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, {{the majority}} of the company's workers appeared for duty, but many were absent. The 65 crews of workmen were able to operate half of the normal routes, and were dispatched to continue operations. The strikers, supported by thousands of other pro-union men, continued their campaign. They blocked streetcar tracks, harassed workers, and demanded that the union be recognized by the company. Dozens of streetcars were vandalized, some were completely destroyed, the overhead electric cables that powered <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> were cut, and passengers were threatened to not to ride <b>the</b> <b>cars.</b> Some company employees were forcibly taken multiple times to Labor Hall to repeat their oaths of loyalty to the union before they were convinced or intimidated to join the strike.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine and}} <b>the</b> <b>car</b> levels {{determine}} how fast and how reliable <b>the</b> <b>car</b> {{will be in}} race for the driver.
