5|$|Throughout the Philippines, damage {{amounted}} to roughly 1.21billion PHP (US$31million), of which 664million PHP (US$17million) {{was attributed to}} agriculture. Approximately eightpercent of the corn and rice harvest was destroyed. A total of 2,605homes were destroyed while another 18,181were damaged. Across seven provinces, 364,733people were affected by the typhoon, 65,585of whom were significantly impacted. A total of 34people lost <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>as</b> a result of Cimaron. Additionally, 65people sustained injuries.|$|E
5|$|Adults {{make their}} homes within holes in various {{mangrove}} trees and maintain an arboreal existence whereas the young are strictly terrestrial {{for the first}} year of <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> <b>As</b> the Utila iguana cannot successfully lay its eggs in the mangrove swamps, the gravid females are forced to migrate to nearby sandy beaches in order to bury their clutches of eggs so they can incubate in the hot sun. After digging their nest burrows and laying their eggs, the females abandon the nests and return to the mangroves. Sixty to seventy-four days later the hatchlings emerge and move back to the swamps.|$|E

5|$|As I {{was reading}} about Cope and Marsh, I ran across Knight as {{something}} of a bit player in <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> <b>As</b> I got further into the Cope and Marsh story, and I liked the two less and less as people—which is different from liking them as characters, of course—I wanted to have a character in the book for the readers to root for, and neither of the scientists could fill that role. When I found out that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character I needed.|$|E
5|$|By 1913, {{the revival}} at Azusa Street had lost momentum, {{and most of}} the media {{attention}} and crowds had left by 1915. Seymour remained there with his wife, Jennie, for the rest of <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>as</b> pastors of the small African American congregation, though he often made short trips to help establish other smaller revivals later in life. After Seymour {{died of a heart attack}} on September 28, 1922, Jennie led the church until 1931, when the congregation lost the building.|$|E
5|$|In Capitalism and Freedom, {{he argued}} that {{conscription}} is inequitable and arbitrary, preventing young men from shaping <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>as</b> they see fit. During the Nixon administration he headed the committee to research a conversion to paid/volunteer armed force. He would later state that his role in eliminating the conscription in the United States was his proudest accomplishment. Friedman did, however, believe a nation could compel military training as a reserve in case of war time.|$|E

5|$|Most {{amphibians}} today remain semiaquatic, {{living the}} first stage of <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>as</b> fish-like tadpoles. Several groups of tetrapods, such as the snakes and cetaceans, have lost some or all of their limbs. In addition, many tetrapods have returned to partially aquatic or fully aquatic lives throughout the history of the group (modern examples of fully aquatic tetrapods include cetaceans and sirenians). The first returns to an aquatic lifestyle may have occurred as early as the Carboniferous Period whereas other returns occurred as recently as the Cenozoic, as in cetaceans, pinnipeds, and several modern amphibians.|$|E
5|$|Public {{reaction}} to the Emperor's speech varied–many Japanese simply listened to it, then went on with <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>as</b> best they could, while some Army and Navy officers chose suicide over surrender. At a base north of Nagasaki, some Japanese Army officers, enraged {{at the prospect of}} surrender, pulled some 16 captured American airmen out of the base prison and hacked them to death with swords. A large, weeping crowd gathered in front of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, with their cries sometimes interrupted by the sound of gunshots as military officers present committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|A {{particularly}} memorable {{match between}} the two sides came on 1 February 1958, when they met in a league fixture at Highbury. It was the last league game that United played before the Munich air disaster five days later, which claimed the lives of eight of their players and saw two other players injured {{to such an extent that}} they never played again. United won the game 5–4, with goals from Tommy Taylor (twice), Duncan Edwards, Bobby Charlton and Dennis Viollet. Five of the United players who would lose <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>as</b> a result of the crash took to the field in the game – captain and full-back Roger Byrne, right-half Eddie Colman, centre-half Mark Jones, left-half Edwards and centre-forward Taylor.|$|E

5|$|Although {{formally}} {{separate from}} Greek Orthodox and Latin (Catholic) Christians, the Armenians consider their quarter {{to be part}} of the Christian Quarter. The three Christian patriarchates of Jerusalem and the government of Armenia have publicly expressed their opposition to any political division of the two quarters. The central reasons for the existence of a separate Armenian Quarter is the miaphysitism and distinct language and culture of the Armenians, who, unlike the majority of Christians in Jerusalem (also in Israel and Palestine), are neither Arab nor Palestinian. However, for all intents and purposes, the Armenians living in the Armenian Quarter are considered Palestinians by Israel and the United Nations (UN). They have faced many of the same restrictions on <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>as</b> have the Palestinians.|$|E
5|$|Committed {{to living}} the {{philosophy}} they sing about, {{the band members}} have each pursued careers apart from <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>as</b> the superstars of Malagasy pop music. Most {{of the members of}} Mahaleo have also launched individual humanitarian projects, in addition to the cooperative they formed together in the 1980s to support the hand-made production of traditional musical instruments, and the Centre des informations de communication, d'animation, formation et d'éducation (CICAFE) rural development center they launched in 2000. As the years passed {{and the members of the}} band matured in their respective careers, they started to write songs more relevant to the difficult conditions of life of the Malagasy people and the underdeveloped state of the nation, addressing such topics as environmental conservation, poverty, education, and violence. Among their hits in this period are songs that address rural-urban flight, homesickness after moving abroad to find work, husbands who abandon their families, and the guilt of military personnel required to carry out repression against their compatriots.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} 1988–89 season, Arsenal led the First Division table; their manager George Graham had {{assembled}} a side mixed with youth and experience, captained by academy graduate Tony Adams. At one stage Arsenal were 11 points clear of defending champions Liverpool, but their lead diminished following a run of bad results. Liverpool, coached by player-manager Kenny Dalglish, capitalised after an indifferent start to the campaign, and emerged as Arsenal's main challengers for the title. Towards {{the end of the}} season Liverpool supporters were involved in a sporting disaster at Hillsborough, where 96 of the club's supporters lost <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>as</b> a result of overcrowding during a match against Nottingham Forest on 15 April. The disaster was the worst of its kind in English sporting history, and led to an inquiry into safety standards of stadiums.|$|E

5|$|Once in the Klondike, {{very few}} women—less than one percent—actually worked as miners. Many {{were married to}} miners; however, <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>as</b> {{partners}} on the gold fields were still hard and often lonely. They had extensive domestic duties, including thawing ice and snow for water, breaking up frozen food, chopping wood and collecting wild foods. In Dawson and other towns, some women took in laundry to make money. This was a physically demanding job, but could be relatively easily combined with child care duties. Others took jobs in the service industry, for example as waitresses or seamstresses, which could pay well, but were often punctuated by periods of unemployment. Both men and women opened roadhouses, but women {{were considered to be}} better at running them. A few women worked in the packing trade, carrying goods on their backs, or became domestic servants.|$|E
5|$|Reed and Sue {{contemplate}} abandoning <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>as</b> superheroes {{in order}} to have a normal life and raise a family, but are unaware Johnny is listening. With the Surfer creating craters around the globe, Reed determines that the next will appear in London. The team arrives too late to stop the crater, which drains the River Thames, but they manage to prevent the London Eye from collapsing after it is damaged by the quake (although Johnny nearly thwarts their attempt when he unwillingly switches powers with Reed). Meanwhile, the Surfer's movements around the globe bring him past Latveria, where the cosmic energy affects their ex-friend Victor Von Doom, freeing him from two years encased in metal. A scarred Doom traces the Surfer to the Russell Glacier and offers to join forces. When the Surfer rebuffs him, Doom attacks. The Surfer retaliates, blasting Doom through the ice, but the cosmic energy of the Surfer's blast heals Doom's body.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Uncle Tupelo's signing, Giant Records {{changed its}} name to Rockville Records. The band's first album for Rockville No Depression, was {{recorded}} over ten days in January 1990, at Fort Apache South recording studio in Boston, Massachusetts. The album's thematic structure revolved around <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>as</b> adolescents in Belleville; examples are songs about wanting to avoid factory work and songs about fearing a potential Persian Gulf War military draft. Impressed by their previous work on Dinosaur Jr.'s Bug, the band wanted Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade to produce the album. Slade let Farrar play on the same 1961 Gibson Les Paul SG Junior that J. Mascis originally played on Bug. The album was released on June 21, 1990, and the band celebrated by playing at Cicero's for two nights.|$|E
