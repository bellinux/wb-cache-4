40|$|With the {{awareness}} of the need for optimal and sustainable use of natural resources, hydrothermal <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>biomass</b> and biomass waste for energy and resource recovery has received increasing attention. In this context, hydrochars produced by hydrothermal <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>biomass,</b> which have been traditionally employed as catalyst supports or adsorbents, are now of considerable interest as precursors for activated carbons. Activated carbon produced from hydrochars has been widely used in applications such as energy storage, environmental remediation and resource recovery. Apart from savings in energy and resource conservation, hydrochars are of interest in activated carbon production because they possess unique attributes such as high density of oxygenated functional groups (OFGs) and low degree of condensation which can be tailored to produce activated carbons with specific and desired characteristics. This review aims to integrate the current knowledge on hydrothermal carbonization of biomass waste in the context of resource and energy recovery. Specifically, we bring together recent advances made in this area through a systematic and critical review of the production of activated carbon from hydrochars. Mechanisms involved in the production of hydrochars with different surface characteristics in response to variations in the operating parameters are critically reviewed. The current knowledge gaps and challenges involved in the hydrothermal carbonization of biomass waste are critically evaluated with suggestions for further research...|$|E

In the present study, torrefaction of karanja de-oiled seed cake {{was carried out in}} a bench-scale fixed bed reactor under inert (N 2) atmosphere. Effects of different reaction variables like temperature and the residence time on the weight loss and carbon conversion have been studied. Experiments were performed to examine the properties of torrefaction products and cold gas efficiency. The effect of torrefaction was studied by measuring the changes in yield, efficiency, tar and char production during gasification <b>of</b> torrefied <b>biomass.</b> The study confirmed that torrefaction <b>of</b> <b>biomass</b> altered the compositions of syngas produced. Increased torrefaction treatment impacted syngas composition yield by reducing carbon dioxide (around 4 to 10 mol %) and increasing H 2 and CH 4. Observed cold gas efficiency ranged between 40 and 80 %. The syngas produced was rich in H 2, CH 4, and CO implying that the syngas quality is significantly improved by torrefaction. Also as expected, the moisture content <b>of</b> <b>biomass</b> is reduced by torrefaction. This holds the advantage for storage, transport and subsequent <b>treatments</b> <b>of</b> <b>biomass</b> at large scale.
