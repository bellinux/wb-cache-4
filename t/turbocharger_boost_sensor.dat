5000|$|There is {{evidence}} that Cosworth {{was working on a}} [...] push-rod V8 {{along the lines of the}} Ilmor/Mercedes 500I to exploit the peculiar loophole in the Indianapolis 500 rules on the definition of the word [...] "pushrod engine", permitting such engines with extremely short pushrods higher <b>turbocharger</b> <b>boost</b> - this was assigned a project code CD but seemingly never completed.|$|R
50|$|MAP sensors measure {{absolute}} pressure. <b>Boost</b> <b>sensors</b> or gauges {{measure the}} amount of pressure above a set absolute pressure. That set absolute pressure is usually 100 kPa. This is {{commonly referred to as}} gauge pressure. Boost pressure is relative to absolute pressure - as one increases or decreases, so does the other. It is a one-to-one relationship with an offset of -100 kPa for boost pressure. Thus a MaP sensor will always read 100 kPa more than a <b>boost</b> <b>sensor</b> measuring the same conditions. A MaP sensor will never display a negative reading because it is measuring absolute pressure, where zero is the total absence of pressure. Vacuum is measured as a negative pressure relative to normal atmospheric pressure. Vacuum-Boost sensors can display negative readings, indicating vacuum or suction (a condition of lower pressure than the surrounding atmosphere). In forced induction engines (supercharged or <b>turbocharged),</b> a negative <b>boost</b> reading indicates that the engine is drawing air faster than it is being supplied, creating suction. The suction is caused by throttling in spark ignition engines and is not present in diesel engines. This is often called vacuum pressure when referring to internal combustion engines.|$|R
50|$|Following {{qualifying}} the ACO {{altered the}} balance of performance in the LMGTE Pro category, adding 10 kg of ballast and lowering <b>turbocharger</b> <b>boost</b> pressure in the Ford GT and adding 25 kg of ballast to the Ferrari 488s to lower their performance. Similarly, Aston Martin and Corvette received an increase in performance by allowing a larger air restrictor on the air intake of their engines. Porsche had no performance changes.|$|R
50|$|In 1987, a dogleg chicane was hastily {{built in}} the middle of the backstretch to slow the cars down, but it was never used in competition. After a couple of {{practice}} runs, it was deemed unsuitable, partially due to fear of gearbox failure, being too abrupt, and not necessarily serving its intended purpose. But it was also scrapped due to concern over fans' negative reactions. Instead, officials decided to reduce <b>turbocharger</b> <b>boost</b> for the race.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is popular}} among enthusiasts {{to replace the}} stock 3S-GTE with the [...] "4th Gen" [...] 3S-GTE from the Caldina GT-T (ST215). This updated engine {{features}} coil on plug electronics, higher compression, a reinforced cylinder block, a higher flowing cylinder head, and a larger integrated to manifold turbocharger colloquially named the CT15. All of these help produce a higher output of [...] and with just a <b>turbocharger</b> <b>boost</b> pressure controller, [...] is reliably attainable.|$|R
5000|$|Pole-sitter Scott Brayton's day ended ten laps down in 17th place. His car {{was down}} on <b>turbocharger</b> <b>boost,</b> and after the race he quipped {{that he was so}} slow he felt he [...] "was in the way." [...] Years later, it would be {{revealed}} that Brayton (and his teammate Arie Luyendyk), were secretly being penalized by USAC for illegally over-boosting their turbocharger plenums and tampering with the pop-off valves during practice and qualifying.|$|R
50|$|When Buick {{pulled out}} of IndyCar racing in 1993, John Menard {{continued}} developing the engine, now badged as the Menard V-6. Brayton, now without a regular ride in the CART IndyCar series, joined the Indy-only Menards team in 1994. Their belief in the powerplant paid off when Brayton won his first Indy 500 pole position in 1995, at an average speed of 231.604 mi/h km/h. <b>Turbocharger</b> <b>boost</b> and pop-off valve problems relegated him to a 17th-place finish.|$|R
50|$|In {{automotive}} applications, 'boost' {{refers to}} the amount by which intake manifold pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure. This {{is representative of the}} extra air pressure that is achieved over what would be achieved without the forced induction. The level of boost may be shown on a pressure gauge, usually in bar, psi or possibly kPa.The control of <b>turbocharger</b> <b>boost</b> has changed dramatically over the 100-plus years of their use. Modern turbochargers can use wastegates, blow-off valves and variable geometry, as discussed in later sections.|$|R
50|$|The D19 was {{introduced}} in 1961 to suit the needs of larger farmers. It was the first D Series tractor besides the diesel D17 to have a six-cylinder engine. Its horsepower was: 71.54 gas; 66.19 propane, and 66.92 diesel. Its displacement was 262 cubic inches. The diesel model {{was the first in}} the industry to come standard with a <b>turbocharger,</b> <b>boosting</b> both horsepower and fuel economy. 10,591 units were built, and they weighed 6650 to 6840 pounds. The D19 was manufactured until 1964. D19s were known for running smoothly and fairly quietly.|$|R
50|$|In short, most <b>boost</b> <b>sensors</b> {{will read}} 100 kPa {{less than a}} MaP sensor reads. One can convert boost to MaP by adding 100 kPa. One can convert from MaP to boost by {{subtracting}} 100 kPa.|$|R

5000|$|The Lamborghini Diablo VTTT (viscous {{traction}} twin turbo) was {{an extremely}} limited production (6 made in 1995, 2 made in 1998, although some say 7 overall) modification of the standard Diablo VT, offered as a special dealer upgrade by Platinum Motors, the Lamborghini dealership of southern California. The cars were equipped with twin blueprinted, water-cooled, Garrett T4 turbochargers with electronically controlled wastegates, custom-built intercoolers, competition-type valves with race-type guides, cylinder heads with polished ports, and a reprogrammed electronic fuel injection system. Modifications to the drivetrain included a custom Kevlar twin-plate clutch {{to cope with the}} extra torque and a new short ratio gearbox to improve acceleration. The brakes were upgraded with cross-drilled, ventilated discs and carbon fiber brake pads. The VTTT featured a dash-mounted switch with three different engine settings including a very limited valet mode and two levels of <b>turbocharger</b> <b>boost</b> ( [...] and [...] ).|$|R
50|$|The Indy 500 {{version of}} the PC-23, showed a much higher engine cover, {{required}} {{because of the new}} engine. Other modifications included changes to the input gears of the gearbox, to cope with the lower rpm and higher power and torque the pushrod engine provided. However, the two versions of the gearbox were of the same weight, thus causing no shift in the weight balance. The Mercedes-Benz 500I engine was slightly lighter than the Ilmor Indy V8, although because of its longer inlets the center of gravity of the entire engine was higher than that of the 500I, thus changing the overall balance of the car a bit. The development and testing of the 500I engine, at that time called Ilmor 265E, took place in the utmost secrecy, because there was a possibility of the <b>turbocharger</b> <b>boost</b> level being changed, or the engine being banned by the Indy 500 sanctioning body.|$|R

50|$|In {{response}} to losing the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Petit Le Mans to the Peugeot 908s, Audi updated their R15 for the 2010 season, creating the R15 plus. 2010 Regulations reduced {{the size of}} diesel LMP1 air restrictors and <b>turbocharger</b> <b>boost</b> pressure. However, despite this, Audi's engineering team led by Ulrich Baretzky were able to achieve engine power and performance that was comparable to the 2009 powerplant. Aerodynamic efficiency was also a major area of focus for 2010. The frontal area of the car was redesigned to reveal the raw crash structures. The front fenders were also lowered {{in an effort to}} reduce drag while the concept of air running through the car was abandoned for a more conventional design.

40|$|This {{study is}} to convert and tune a bus diesel engine for {{electricity}} production in a farm using biogas as fuel. The engine under study is a Hino K- 13 CTI 13, 000 cc 24 valve turbocharged engine coupled to a 3 phase 4 pole induction motor to produce electricity at 50 Hz. Modifications include an addition of biogas carburetor for air-fuel mixing, replacing the fuel injection system with spark ignition system, reduction of compression ratio from the original 16 : 1 to 8 : 1 using a cylinder head spacer, and modification of the turbocharger waste gate so the boost pressure can be adjusted. When the induction motor is synchronized to the power grid, the running speed of the engine is 1, 500 rpm. Optimal engine efficiency was achieved at 28. 6 % by setting the lambda factor at 1. 097, ignition timing at 54 o before top dead center, and the <b>turbocharger</b> <b>boost</b> at 56 kPa.
