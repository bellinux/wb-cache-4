50|$|<b>Talsaclidine</b> (WAL-2014) is a non-selective muscarinic {{acetylcholine}} receptor agonist which {{acts as a}} full agonist at the M1 subtype, and as a partial agonist at the M2 and M3 subtypes. It was under development {{for the treatment of}} Alzheimer's disease but showed only modest or poor efficacy in rhesus monkeys and humans, respectively, perhaps due to an array of dose-limiting side effects including increased heart rate and blood pressure, increased salivation, urinary frequency and burning upon urination, increased lacrimation and nasal secretion, abnormal accommodation, heartburn, upset stomach as well as cramps, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, excessive sweating and palpitations.|$|E
40|$|The amyloid beta-peptides A beta 40 and A beta 42 {{are highly}} amyloidogenic {{constituents}} of brain beta-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lowering their formation may {{be achieved by}} modulating the activities of proteases that cleave the amyloid precursor protein (A beta PP), including alpha- beta-, and gamma-secretases. <b>Talsaclidine</b> is a functionally selective muscarinic m 1 agonist that stimulates non-amyloidogenic alpha-secretase processing in vitro. We compared cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of A beta 40 and A beta 42 measured by ELISA before {{and at the end}} of 4 weeks of treatment with <b>talsaclidine.</b> The medication was administered in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized clinical study to 40 patients with AD. <b>Talsaclidine</b> (n = 34) decreased CSF levels of A beta 42 by a median of 19 % (p < 0. 001) as compared to baseline. The mean difference between CSF levels of A beta 42 before and after treatment with <b>talsaclidine</b> (n = 34) was - 46 +/- 73 (SD) pg/ml as compared to 0 +/- 8 (SD) pg/ml with placebo (n = 6) (p < 0. 05). CSF levels of A beta 40 increased during treatment with placebo (n = 6) while they remained stable during treatment with <b>talsaclidine</b> (n = 31) (1. 118 +/- 1. 710 ng/ml, and - 0. 170 +/- 0. 967 ng/ml, respectively; p < 0. 05). These data show that treatment with the m 1 agonist <b>talsaclidine</b> reduced A beta peptides, and particularly A beta 42, in AD patients, suggesting it as a potential amyloid lowering therapy of AD...|$|E
30|$|One of the chiral alcohols, (R)- 3 -quinuclidinol, is {{a useful}} {{compound}} applicable to the synthesis of various pharmaceuticals, such as <b>talsaclidine</b> and revatropate (Rzeszotarski et al. 1988; Bietti et al. 1990; Cross and Stobie 1993; Takeuchi et al. 1996; Alabaster 1997; Ward et al. 1998; Leusch et al. 2000; Ishihara et al. 2004). So far, chemical and biochemical methods have been applied to produce (R)- 3 -quinuclidinol (Stembach and Kaiser 1952; Rehavi et al. 1977; Muchmore 1993; Bossard 1997; Brieden 1998; Matsuyama and Hamatani 1998; Sato and Enomoto 1999; Nomoto et al. 2003; Yamamoto et al. 2003; Takenaka 2006), {{and most of these}} methods take the approach of resolving a racemic mixture. Recently, for the production of (R)- 3 -quinuclidinol, 3 -quinuclidinone reductase (RrQR) was isolated from Rhodotorula rubra (Uzura et al. 2009). The purified enzyme from R. rubra is specific to NADPH as a coenzyme and stereospecifically produces the (R)-enantiomer of 3 -quinuclidinol from 3 -quinuclidinone. Furthermore, a coexpression system for the 3 -quinuclidinone reductase and glucose dehydrogenase using Escherichia coli as a host was developed for the large-scale production of (R)- 3 -quinuclidinol. The system using the enzyme is superior to former kinetic resolution methods in that it has a higher molar yield, requires no substrate modification, and so on (Uzura et al. 2009).|$|E
40|$|LU 25 - 109 (II) and WAL 2014 (<b>talsaclidine,</b> III) are two M 1 muscarinic {{agonists}} chemically {{related to}} the natural substance arecoline (I). All these compounds have beneficial effects on memory and cognition in animals and humans, {{and they have been}} proposed in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, but only III will likely find a place in therapy. In this work we have investigated the solid state structures of II and III and the X-ray structures of the two molecules and of the parent compound I have been used to input a series of computational chemistry efforts. In particular, the X-ray geometries have been manipulated to model 20 molecular structures (1 - 20) which have been submitted to ab initio, semiempirical quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics calculations. The conformational space accessible to the 20 structures has been assessed by means of potential energy maps. The reactivities of 1 - 20 have been estimated by examining at the graphics terminal the composition and the extension of the frontier orbitals (HOMOs and LUMOs) and of the molecular electrostatic potential. The information obtained has been interpreted to explain the different degrees of activity shown by I-III. Our data indicate that III has better in vivo activity for its intermediate size, less polar surface, conformational rigidity and orientation of reactive domains. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|The {{norepinephrine}} transporter (NET) transports norepinephrine {{from the}} synapse into presynaptic neurons, where norepinephrine regulates signaling pathways associated with cardiovascular effects and behavioral traits via binding to various receptors (e. g., β 2 -adrenergic receptor). NET is a known target {{for a variety}} of prescription drugs, including antidepressants and psychostimulants, and may mediate off-target effects of other prescription drugs. Here, we identify prescription drugs that bind NET, using virtual ligand screening followed by experimental validation of predicted ligands. We began by constructing a comparative structural model of NET based on its alignment to the atomic structure of a prokaryotic NET homolog, the leucine transporter LeuT. The modeled binding site was validated by confirming that known NET ligands can be docked favorably compared to nonbinding molecules. We then computationally screened 6, 436 drugs from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG DRUG) against the NET model. Ten of the 18 high-scoring drugs tested experimentally were found to be NET inhibitors; five of these were chemically novel ligands of NET. These results may rationalize the efficacy of several sympathetic (tuaminoheptane) and antidepressant (tranylcypromine) drugs, as well as side effects of diabetes (phenformin) and Alzheimer’s (<b>talsaclidine)</b> drugs. The observations highlight the utility of virtual screening against a comparative model, even when the target shares less than 30 % sequence identity with its template structure and no known ligands in the primary binding site...|$|E
