40|$|The {{study will}} analyse how Anglo-American evangelicals' {{antipathy}} towards slavery spread and transformed {{in the context}} of <b>the</b> <b>transatlantic</b> evangelical network. Many researchers have treated antislavery sentiment as a spontaneous reaction, or as {{one of a number of}} background moods influencing those who started the abolitionist movement. However, this sentiment spread in the Atlantic world as result of evangelical activities throughout the eighteenth century. The formation of <b>the</b> <b>transatlantic</b> evangelical network is central to understanding the spread of antislavery sentiment. Stimulated by the Great Awakening in the 1730 s and the 1740 s, Anglo-American evangelicals began to travel between both sides of the Atlantic. Much evidence suggests that a religious and ideological sense of unity was being forged during this process. Importantly, the evangelical network offered a channel of transatlantic communication allowing Anglo-Americans to debate common issues. Although in itself not antislavery, it had the potential to develop antislavery sentiment among its members. Many historians have not traced the development of antislavery ideals in the mid-eighteenth century as there seemed no public self-identifying antislavery movement. However, close examination of 'proslavery' literature reinvents this period into years of transformation of evangelical attitudes to slavery, far from a 'dark age' of unquestioned proslavery expression. Below the surface, fledgling antislavery sentiment was spreading in the Atlantic world before the American Revolution. In the tense atmosphere of the American Revolution in the 1770 s, antislavery sentiment became transformed into moral conviction. Many members of religious communities on both sides of the Atlantic lost their confidence in the imperial system, and were fearful for their moral health. As part of this process, ill-feeling towards both the inhumanity and religio-moral inconsistencies of slavery became transformed into a moral ideology. Furthermore, the Revolution stimulated evangelical abolitionism and participation in wider secular political activities. After the Revolution, the evangelical network seemed to be reinvigorated, responding to new territorial and economic circumstance. However, conflicts within <b>the</b> <b>transatlantic</b> evangelical <b>community</b> caused by disestablishment debates stimulated the process of division, and influenced the developmental process of the antislavery movement in <b>the</b> <b>transatlantic</b> evangelical network. Consequently, evangelicals in each area developed individual abolitionist movements, producing different outcomes. This reflects that <b>the</b> <b>transatlantic</b> evangelical network's mission for a <b>transatlantic</b> channel for <b>the</b> antislavery cause was finishing.

40|$|A {{consensus}} is emerging in <b>the</b> <b>transatlantic</b> <b>community</b> that the Kremlin’s manipulation of information constitutes {{a real threat}} to EU security. Across Europe, far-right, populist and Euro- skeptic political parties are embracing Russia’s information campaigns. In the European Parliament, Marine Le Pen’s Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) is the main proponent of pro-Kremlin narratives. The foreign policy platform of the Front National in France contains explicit references to a strategic alliance with the Kremlin and a pan-European Union that includes Russia. Following Brexit, Marine Le Pen is describing the UK vote as a peoples’ rebellion that has signaled {{the beginning of the}} end for the EU, much like the fall of the Berlin Wall signaled the collapse of the Soviet Union. Conceivably, in the aftermath of Brexit the absence of British Eurosceptic MEPs from the European Parliament may lead to the consolidation of the radical far-right under the banner of the Front National. In turn, this means that the EU may have a rather difficult time gathering the necessary support to confront Russian assertiveness in the Eastern Neighbourhood...|$|E

We argue that to the extent either of the Italian “objective correlatives” makes any sense, it is Berlusconi not Mussolini.

The new, global {{international}} security threats {{of the twenty-first}} century, including terrorism, the {{proliferation of weapons of}} mass destruction (WMD), failed states, energy security, and cyber terrorism, among others, have drastically affected, challenged, and changed the transatlantic relationship that existed during the Cold War.

40|$|NATO {{needs to}} define its global purpose if it wishes to address global threats. What is the {{prospect}} of NATO going global and how will it affect NATO's future course? In {{the run-up to the}} NATO Summit in Riga in November 2006, a debate {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic has now evolved over NATO's global engagement that touches on the very foundations of NATO's original purpose and definition. Critically, the debate is no longer about wether NATO should go 'out of area or out of business' but whether the Alliance should enlarge on a global level from Vancouver to Tokyo and Wellington. In order to place this debate into the recent historical context of the Alliance, this article examines U. S. -European security relations since September 11 within the institutional framework of NATO and, subsequently, draws conclusions for the future role of the Alliance. As <b>the</b> <b>transatlantic</b> <b>community</b> faces security threats of inherently global nature such as internationally organized terrorism and crime, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, collapse or lack of state structures in certain regions, and ruptures in the stable supply of energy resources, NATO will have to define its role as a global security actor if it wishes to avoid becoming a mere service provider of security.

40|$|Recent {{experience}} permits us {{to form a}} {{more concrete}} picture of how Europe's security architecture will look in the next century. The most important steps have included {{the opening of the}} North Atlan-tic Treaty Organization (NATO) through the Partnership for Peace (PfP), the signing of political charters with Russia and Ukraine, the entry of three new members, the Alliance-led military opera-tions in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo, and the decision to enlarge the European Union (EU). Most recently we have seen the rapprochement between NATO and the EU, the latter's decision to integrate the Western European Union (WEU) and to be more actively involved in the so-called Pe-tersberg tasks, and- finally- the agreement to create a Union of Freedom, Security and Justice by integrating the Schengen and Dublin agreements into community law. Against the background of these important developments, in this chapter I attempt to answer two basic questions: What are the central pillars of Europe's security architecture? How do Europe's security organizations contribute to the strengthening of these pillars?

40|$|By {{the turn}} of the 21 st century liberal {{democracy}} and democracy promotion have both become strongly entrenched norms in U. S. and E. U. foreign policies. Despite squabbles over a host of international issues, democracy as a system of government and an ideal is fundamentally shared by Americans and Europeans. Moreover, the erosion of state sovereignty and principles of non-intervention, as well as growing appreciation of the links between substantive democracy and economic development, peace and security, have made the goal of democracy promotion a shared one for Americans and Europeans. We argue that contemporary Europe and the United States are united by a normative commitment to democracy and the objective of supporting and promoting its development outside <b>the</b> <b>transatlantic</b> <b>community.</b> But does this mean that the E. U. and U. S. pursue the same democracy promotion strategies? We suggest that the answer is "sometimes, and sometimes not" and that it is dynamic. At times, and in different contexts, E. U. and U. S. strategies and instruments converge and diverge. Finally, we argue that divergence in strategies can be explained with reference to three key factors: the different histories and formative experiences that have shaped E. U. and U.

40|$|The Russiaâ€“Georgia war of August 2008 had repercussions {{well beyond}} the South Caucasus. The war was the {{culmination}} of Western tensions with Russia over its influence in the postâ€“Soviet space, while the fallout exposed divisions within <b>the</b> <b>transatlantic</b> <b>community</b> over how aggressively to confront Moscow after its invasion of undisputed Georgian territory and its permanent stationing of troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The conflict also called into question Georgia's relationship with the United States, as well as U. S. credibility as a regional security partner in light of Washington's apparent inability either to restrain Tbilisi from launching an attack against Tskhinvali in August 2008 or to help its ally once the war began. Since the war, both the United States and Europe have provided significant financial support to help rebuild Georgia and have denounced the continued presence of Russian forces in the breakaway territories. <b>The</b> <b>transatlantic</b> <b>community,</b> however, has failed to develop a forward-looking strategy toward those territories. The West's adamant refusal to accept Russia's recognition of the declared independence of these two territories in August 2008 is legally correct, but just pledging enduring support for Georgia's territorial integrity is impractical and somewhat meaningless now that Abkhazia and South Ossetia are even further out of Georgian sovereignty than they were before the war. These territories almost certainly are lost to Georgia for the short and medium termsâ€”possibly for a period of decadesâ€”and Russian influence has substantially increased in both regions. Russia has formally recognized their independence, and perhaps ironically, the territories have gone from enjoying de facto independence as unrecognized states and parties to frozen conflicts, before August 2008, to becoming almost de facto parts of the Russian Federation in their new status as "independent states. " Further, Russia has sought international support (particularly from Latin American countries) for the policy, offering economic incentives to secure recognition from third parties such as Nicaragua and Venezuela. Russia's "sovereign diplomatic" offensive, therefore, has further eroded the very international regime of sovereignty which Moscow professed to uphold when it criticized Kosovo's 2008 unilateral declaration of independence as a "dangerous precedent. " The war's troubling consequences for the region's territorial disputes do not seem to have resulted in any updated Western policy initiatives or active measures to rollback Russia's accelerating absorption of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Nearly 20 years {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union, Eurasia's unrecognized states remain isolated and dependent on regional patrons, removed from international governance structures, rules, and norms. Instead of a region pursuing greater global integration, the unrecognized states continue to act as islands of isolation while regional powers seek to monopolize their interactions. With these pressing factors in mind, we propose a basic outline of a new approach called "engagement without recognition" for Western policy toward at least Abkhazia, a policy that could serve as a model for crafting more robust engagement with Eurasia's other unrecognized states. According to this strategy, Abkhazia would be given the opportunity to engage with the West on a number of political, economic, social, and cultural issues for the purpose of lessening Russia's influence. While undertaking this strategy, the West must make it clear that Abkhazia's status as an independent state will never be accepted by either the United States or the EU. By separating the international legal dimensions of sovereignty (the question of non-recognition) from its governance aspects, the West can attempt to gain some needed strategic leverage over Abkhazia, which it currently lacks...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT JANE EYRE AND HER TRANSATLANTIC LITERARY DESCENDANTS: THE HEROIC FEMALE BILDUNGSROMAN AND CONSTRUCTIONS OF NATIONAL IDENTITY by ABIGAIL RUTH HEINIGER May 2013 Advisor: Dr. Anca Vlasopolos Major: English Degree: Doctor of Philosophy This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} role of fairy tales and fairy lore across the arc of Charlotte Brontë 2 ̆ 7 s career from Jane Eyre (1847) to Villette (1853) in order to demonstrate {{the evolution of the}} heroic female bildungsroman in Brontë 2 ̆ 7 s work. This distinctive narrative paradigm, the heroic female bildungsroman, is incorporated into a perpetual search for a mythology to define womanhood, which ripples out from Jane Eyre 2 ̆ 7 s literary descendants written by women, both in Great Britain, Continental Europe and across the Atlantic, in the United States and Canada. Expanding upon the theory of transatlantic literary exchange modeled by Amanda Claybaugh in The Novel of Purpose: Literature and Social Reform in the Anglo-American World (2007), I demonstrate the ideological influence of Jane Eyre and the reciprocal influence of American literary responses on interpretation of Charlotte Brontë 2 ̆ 7 s work. The fairytale allusions and, more particularly, the fairy heroine figure featured in Jane Eyre are excised from Brontë 2 ̆ 7 s final novel, Villette (1851). Nor do they survive intact in Jane Eyre 2 ̆ 7 s other literary descendants: Elizabeth Barrett Browning 2 ̆ 7 s Aurora Leigh (1856), Susan Warner 2 ̆ 7 s The Wide, Wide World (1850), L. M. Montgomery 2 ̆ 7 s Anne of Green Gables (1908), and Hannah Crafts 2 ̆ 7 s The Bondwoman 2 ̆ 7 s Narrative (ca 1850). These four texts are certainly not the only works of literature that were influenced by Jane Eyre; however, {{these are some of the}} most prominent examples of literature written by women that are currently being posited as literary descendants of Brontë 2 ̆ 7 s debut novel. Moreover, all four of these texts attempt to replace Brontë 2 ̆ 7 s fairytale allusions in unique and distinctive ways; these authors all model the search for a female mythology, which persists into the twentieth-first century. Moreover, like Brontë 2 ̆ 7 s fairy heroine, the larger-than-life heroines in her literary progeny are invested with a range of regional and national associations that generate nationalistic messages. Chapter One functions as an introduction to my main argument as well as an overview of my critical approach. It particularly outlines the distinctive transatlantic microcosm that develops around Jane Eyre as well as the Cinderella paradigm projected back onto Brontë 2 ̆ 7 s novel by American authors and readers. Chapter Two covers the arc of Brontë 2 ̆ 7 s career; it explores the dominant fairytale paradigms in Jane Eyre and identifies {{the role of}} the fairy lore in constructing the heroic Jane Eyre. This chapter demonstrates the connections between the heroic changeling and the local, pre-Victorian fairy lore. The argument relies heavily on primary source material from Haworth and Yorkshire as well as periodicals that the Brontë family read. It concludes by demonstrating how fairytale material in Villette is excised. Chapter Three explores <b>the</b> <b>transatlantic</b> <b>community</b> of women writers in which Brontë was immersed. It begins with the ideological or imaginary transatlantic exchange between Great Britain and the United States discussed by Amanda Claybaugh in The Novel of Purpose (2007). It also explores the role that Elizabeth Gaskell 2 ̆ 7 s biography The Life of Charlotte Brontë played in generating a transatlantic mythology that linked Brontë 2 ̆ 7 s life with her texts. Finally, this chapter examines the mainstream literary descendants of Jane Eyre. It identifies the heavy reliance on classical mythological allusions to generate a female mythology in the British descendants of Jane Eyre in the Victorian Era, particularly Aurora Leigh. It also examines Canadian novel Anne of Green Gables and U. S. novel The Wide, Wide World and the American Cinderella paradigm that these novels develop. I argue that the 2 ̆ 2 Beauty and the Beast 2 ̆ 2 and fairy bride allusions in Jane Eyre resonated with the cultural traditions of Brontë 2 ̆ 7 s British audience while Cinderella reflects nineteenth-century American ideals. Chapter Three concludes with an examination of the recently discovered, unpublished manuscript, The Bondwoman 2 ̆ 7 s Narrative (ca. 1850), by Hannah Crafts. This is the first novel written by an escaped female slave in the United States. Recent scholarship on Crafts has commented on the way her text borrows large amounts of material from other popular novels, primarily Charles Dickens 2 ̆ 7 Bleak House (1852) and Jane Eyre; critics have even identified the influence of Villette in the final chapter of Crafts 2 ̆ 7 s novel. The treatment of Jane Eyre and Villette in The Bondwoman 2 ̆ 7 s Narrative is a distinctive addition to current scholarship on Brontë 2 ̆ 7 s literary progeny, which has focused exclusively on white authors. Furthermore, this close reading of The Bondwoman 2 ̆ 7 s Narrative is the first to put this novel in conversation with the network of mainstream authors that developed around Jane Eyre. Unlike white American women writers, Crafts 2 ̆ 7 s repositioning of Jane Eyre does not rely upon Cinderella allusions; rather, she creates a heroic female bildungsroman that undermines this American narrative paradigm, demonstrating that the white fairytale expectations are founded upon exploitation. Finally, Chapter Four analyzes the cultural significance of transatlantic responses to Jane Eyre. Brontë 2 ̆ 7 s novel was incorporated into an American narrative culture. In fact, I argue that American readers project the nineteenth-century American self-rise ethic onto Jane Eyre, placing it at the center of a distinctly nationalistic tradition. More specifically, Jane Eyre became mired in narratives of nineteenth-century American identity formation. It was absorbed into the parallel tradition of male and female rise tales, related to American individualism and the self-rise ethic. The male narrative tradition has been dominated in the popular imagination by novels like Horatio Alger 2 ̆ 7 s, while the American Cinderella became the term to describe the female narrative tradition...|$|E
