50|$|In his prime, {{his voice}} was mellifluous, his versatility, an un-inked watermark. ‘Niche’ {{audience}} he captured. With irreproachable style and sabeki accent. With ease, without {{the slightest hint of}} body movement. Not exactly a cock-a-hoop for the aam admi. His brand equity though was adamantine for those who accepted him. Strangely, even at the zenith of his career, many of his numbers were never broadcast over the AIR…A case in point was a chartbuster from a 1952 film; music composed by Salil Chowdhuri. The action defied logic. One wonders if it is because he had terminated his contract with the AIR earlier for his alleged difference of opinion. By any reckoning, it was a daring step, for the AIR was the only mass media channel available those days. What followed, however, was quite incredible. Heaps of protest letters from his fans started piling up on the tables of hapless AIR officials…They had had <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>track</b> and offer him a fresh contract. Around the same time, he was summoned to Bombay. By R C Boral. Through a brief telegram: Come sharp… No reason given.On arrival, he found out to his dismay, that it was for a two-month assignment, all cut and dried. His immediate reaction: nothing doing. He was hell bent on returning the very next day. However, his respect for RC finally won over but not before he extracted a promise from him that never again would he be called to come to Bombay.His assignment embraced: a solo; a duet with Lata; a chorus with Lata and Rafi; and help pick up nuances of devotional and kirtan styles for stalwarts like Lata, Asha, Mukesh, Rafi. Talat and Geeta.The duet with Lata deserves a special mention in that it shows his immense respect for other singers. After a day’s practice, Lata came to the studio for recording. Her rendering was so impeccable that Dhanajay later confided that had Lata not been junior to him in age, he would have touched her feet as Devi Saraswati.Lata apart, S D Burman, Salil Chaudhuri and many others asked him many times over to come over to Bombay. A fabulous job offer too came his way but to no avail. Lure of money could not sway him. For he always felt more at home, at home - in Bengal. Some little-known factsHere’s one instance how he marked his footstep in the world of classical music…Film: Tansen. Pt Bhimshen Jhosi, chosen as the original playback singer, recorded a Dhrupad number. Somehow, Robin Chattopadhya, the Music Director, wasn’t 100% satisfied. Ramesh Bandopadhya of Vishnupur Gharana was called in. Somehow this too went amiss. However, the next take was ‘fit’. By you know who. His excellence stood out in many other ways. When Hemanta Mukherjee created a sensation with his composition and songs for Sapmochan bagging the Gold Prize as the Best Music Director for the year, the Gold Prize as the best play-back singer went to Dhanajay for his devotional songs in Rani RasmoniAmong his basic records, one Raag based composition by Salil Chowdhuri released as a Saradiya Number was such a hit that it kept on selling during the next Puja too.Probably one of his best kept secrets was that he was a prolific lyricist too, all written under different pseudo names. Many hit numbers of Pannalal Bhattacharya in particular were penned by him as well as music composed.One for the fraternitySatinath Mukherjee, struggling for a breakthrough, came along with Shyamal Mitra with a request if he would care to record one of his compositions which he sang out. After a prolonged silence, he declined and then added… “This song is meant for you”. He ensured that HMV complied with his request. That was the breakthrough that was for Satinath who shortly afterward composed the year’s best selling Puja Number for him:’ Sunya Ghare Phire Elam’.Mrinal Chakrabarti’s breakthrough too makes for an interesting reading. He was singing as a local guy in a function when he was spotted by Dhanajay and was asked to call on him the next day without being told the nature of the call. Two of them then proceeded to a small ‘practising room’ and Mrinal Chakrabarti was asked to sing a song. Immediately afterward, he was told that his audition was over and that he would be signed up by HMV.Pralhad Bramhachari’s case was even more interesting. He approached him if he could be considered by the Gramophone Company. Then and there he made a request over the phone to HMV but the person on the other side said it would be absolutely impossible. Not only all the Puja records were ready but also the booklet, Saradiya Arghya, had also been sent to the printer. “In that case, please exclude my record”, was the stern diktat. HMV could not chance it and Pralhad Brahamachari was ‘in’.Pintu Bhattacharya too was backed to the hilt, first being coached classical music by him, free of cost and later helped out with his career as he began to establish himself as a singer.The first opportunity for Arati Mukherjee cutting a disc was also created by him. She was far too young then. On the spot, he asked the film director to include her as a playback singer. Since there was no such scope in the film, naturally the answer was in the negative. Not to be undone, he insisted that a situation could always be created and so it was. The very next day, Arati sang for a small boy in the film in a duet with him in a father’s role.Strong and softHe was asked to sing for the Prime Minster’s Relief Fund. “ Sorry, where is the Prime Minister’s letter?”, he questioned. The persons who carried the message were flummoxed. They rushed to Dr B C Roy, for the programme was virtually finalized with the list of the artistes participating. Dr Roy, instead of getting upset, muttered “ If only we Bengalees had such guts”. He arranged to get a special letter of invitation from Panditji; after all the trouble was created by Dr. Roy’s “golden voice”, as he used to call him.Quite early on in his career he had sat in a dharna fighting for better compensation.Now, the softer side. On being told that Shyampukur Bati was crumbling down, where Sri Ramakrishna had stayed for some time for treatment of cancer, he put in an incredible effort along with Gautam Gupta, Mahendra Gupta’s grandson, to salvage the situation though he was almost nbeearing his active singing career then. A fairly substantial donation apart, he took it upon himself to provide ‘technical assistance’ in rebuilding the civil construction at his own cost.Despite his Spartan lifestyle, his charities were legion. To mark the 50th year of his singing career, HMV arranged for a felicitation programme at the Rabindra Sadan,Calcutta, attended by Jyoti Basu, Hemanta Mukherjee, Salil Chowdhuri, Shyamal Mitra, V Balsara and other luminaries. There he was given a munificent sum as a token of his contribution. Straightaway, he distributed the money among various charities.His another trait was to entertain friends and guests with delicacies he would cook himself. Though a vegan, he had many non-veg recipes up his sleeves. And there were very few artistes in his era who had not savoured his preparations.|$|E

40|$|Everyday {{speech is}} {{littered}} with disfluencies. Disfluencies are perceived as negative as it is felt they disrupt conversation flow without adding any communicative function. In this eye tracking experiment the edit interval is directly manipulated making a short edit interval and a longer edit interval. It is hypothesised listeners upon hearing a disfluency would take the disfluency {{as a sign that}} an error had been made and as a result would predict what the speaker meant to convey. It was also hypothesised that a longer edit interval would instigate listeners <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>track</b> further when making a prediction about a possible repair. Results show a short edit interval leads listeners to predict no change would be made to the reparandum object and a long edit interval leads listeners to predict a colour change would be made to the reparandum object. Listeners seem to take disfluencies to mean that the speaker has made an error and in turn will predict what the speaker meant to convey, however it is apparent that longer edit intervals do not encourage listeners <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>track</b> when predicting a repair. Edit interval length was shown to be important in aiding the listener to make a prediction. It is concluded that the longer the edit interval, the more time available for the listener to recognise an error was made and subsequently make a prediction about a possible repair. It is also concluded that listeners would believe the word immediately preceding the disfluency was the error word and therefore would not track back further than the word immediately preceding the disfluency when predicting a repair. Results lend support to the argument that disfluencies, in particular fillers such as uh, serve a communicative function to the listener by indicating an error has been made on behalf of the speaker. The study also highlights the importance of the length of the edit interval when interpreting listeners’ predictions...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was focused {{to find out}} a method to develop or update the National Road Inventory Database in a cost effective manner.

Any revision on existing Inventory Databases or originating New Databases should be done with the completion of an inventory survey.

For the complete Road Inventory Database, the inventory survey should be carried out to cover all links in the network.

According to the inventory survey carried out by Transportation Engineering Division of University of Moratuwa, it was found that approximately half of the total cost of inventory survey occurred for the idle traveling. If the road inventory survey can be carried out with minimum idle traveling that method will be the most effective method to carry out the survey. Hence under this research, it was found a method which minimizes the 'idle traveling' by considering the both cases of survey trip patterns...|$|E

40|$|Development of {{real-time}} predictive modeling {{to identify}} the dispersion and/or source(s) of airborne {{weapons of mass destruction}} including chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear material in urban environments is needed to improve response to potential releases of these materials via either terrorist or accidental means. These models will also prove useful in defining airborne pollution dispersion in urban environments for pollution management/abatement programs. Predicting gas flow in an urban setting on a scale of less than a few kilometers is a complicated and challenging task due to the irregular flow paths that occur along streets and alleys and around buildings of different sizes and shapes, i. e., ''urban canyons''. In addition, air exchange between the outside and buildings and subway areas further complicate the situation. Transport models that are used to predict dispersion of WMD/CBRN materials or <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>track</b> the source of the release require high-density data and need defensible parameterizations of urban processes. Errors in the data or any of the parameter inputs or assumptions will lead to misidentification of the airborne spread or source release location(s).

40|$|Creating the {{theoretical}} framework, conceptual tools {{and design of}} a doctoral research project {{is a very complex}} undertaking. The intent {{of this paper is to}} help to demystify the process and give some practical guidance for new researchers in order for them to avoid (or overcome) obstacles and minimise the time and effort required to complete their research proposal and thesis. When starting out on my doctoral research odyssey, a labyrinth of potential research methodologies confronted me. Finding a way through this labyrinth to complete my journey (doctoral thesis) seemed to be a daunting task. This paper describes the iterative processes I used to create a road map for myself to help me navigate through the plethora of research methodologies available when conducting educational research. To progress in my journey I had to negotiate roadblocks and detours and learn how to recognise when I was heading toward a dead-end and needed <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>track</b> in order to find a thoroughfare to my destination. The theoretical framework I used in my doctoral research was the sociology of innovation theory or actor-network theory (Latour, 1987; Law, 1992). ANT is also referred to as the sociology of translation (Callon, 1986). Roadblocks were incidents such as my principal supervisor and methodology specialist moving to another university. Detours were episodes when I digressed in my reading or in my thinking or both. Sometimes this was on purpose in order to understand a key concept; at other times I had wandered off on a tangent. Dead-ends were occasions when my reading didn’t help me to move forward in my thinking. One technique that I found helpful to assist me in overcoming the roadblocks, returning to the main road after a detour or spotting a dead-end was to take a helicopter ride to move above the roadway and the traffic and to view the research landscape. This allowed me to put my doctoral research into perspective and view the thoroughfares (the theory, research methods and techniques which would allow me to answer my research questions) that would lead me towards my final destination – the completed thesis...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 19) I {{would like}} to discuss a style of painting, which originated in Europe soon after World War II, that prevails among many abstract painters today. I include myself as one of these painters who have incorporated this type of aesthetic into their work. Though it may seem less innovative <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>track,</b> I believe that artists who seek parallels throughout history can fully comprehend the long range effects of their efforts. These artists, who recognize the intrinsic value {{as well as the}} apparent nature of their work, generate a fresh vitality within current art movements without the stagnation of academic dogma. From an overall viewpoint, social limitations cause individuals to respond in a predictable manner to cyclical events, and repeated cause and effect multi-disguised as "new" go down in history. Artists, therefore, willingly or not become documentarians in the broadest perspective. Perhaps then it is less crucial that each artist break through to a "new" dimension in the art mainstream. Such was the case within a less famous group of European painters during the late forties and early fifties which include Antoni Tapies, Hosiasson, Nicolas De Stael, Karl Fred Dahman, K. R. H. Sonderborg, Emil Shumacher, Jean Fautrier, and Jean Dubuffet. These artists were knows as "matter painters" and though their mild discoveries lacked the glamour of the "Tenth Street niche," they revealed a most unique kind of informalism, distinct from Biomorphism or Abstract Expressionism, that was clearly a violent reaction to reductive and plastic limitations imposed by the non-objective spirit of the De Stijl and Constructivist schools. Emphasis on strict visualty included a kind of plastic consideration without conceptual interruption as well as the use of nonfigurative imagery applied in a brutal or often offensive manner. I {{would like to}} isolate and discuss this type of painting as an attempt to truly explain the source of reference behind my own painting along with my personal viewpoints. World War II caused many European artists to relocate. This managed to affect the arts of the period, eliminating the "absolutes" of content and ideology. Some French artists' obsessions with conceptualizing sensations and images were probably a result of literary values based on modern European philosophies and novels, and their works might appear as action painting with a few splashes of European folklore. The "matter" painters, who may have described their work as an amalgam of the "Surrealist dream fused with concrete life into a new romantic Realism," treated the paint medium itself as a non-representational reference to an iconographical language independent of figuration. Michel Tapie believed that painting should not "say" or "express" but should "live," and not make a commitment to either free form or geometry but rather stress the importance of the primary state of the work. Thus the subject could be dictated by its process, allowing form to be geometric, without implications of hard-edge painting standards. (See more in text...|$|E
