5|$|It is {{the nature}} of man to build <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>complicated</b> cage of rules and {{regulations}} in which to trap himself, and then, with equal ingenuity and zest, to bend his brain to the problem of wriggling triumphantly out again. Lent was a challenge; the game was to ferret out the loopholes.|$|E
5|$|The Floriana Lines are {{considered}} to be among <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>complicated</b> and elaborate of the Hospitaller fortifications of Malta.

25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>complicating</b> {{factors related}} to such ventures {{is the fact that}} the CIS states' broad railway gauge is {{incompatible}} with China and Western and Central Europe's standard gauge. Therefore, a train travelling from China to Western Europe would encounter gauge breaks twice: at the Chinese–Mongolian or the Chinese–Russian frontier and at the Ukrainian or the Belorussian border with Central European countries.|$|R
5|$|The film {{contains}} around fifty {{shots with}} computer-generated imagery. Alfredson {{wanted to make}} them very subtle and almost unnoticeable. The sequence where multiple cats attack Virginia, one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>complicated</b> scenes to film, required several weeks of drafting and planning. The crew used a combination of real cats, stuffed cats and computer-generated imagery.|$|E
5|$|He was {{admitted}} into the Colegio Nacional de La Plata in 1936. After {{graduating from high}} school, he {{was admitted}} to the School of Medicine at the National University of La Plata. During his third year, he began his medical residency at the Hospital Policlínico San Martín, a medical center that received <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>complicated</b> cases from much of Buenos Aires province. This residency brought him into contact with patients for the first time. He attended procedures carried out by professors José María Mainetti and Federico E. B. Christmann, from whom he learned the simplicity and standardization that he would later apply to cardiovascular surgery, one of his many great contributions to cardiovascular operating techniques. Favaloro graduated with a medical degree in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Spasticity: {{spasticity}} {{is characterized}} by increased stiffness and slowness in limb movement, the development of certain postures, an association with weakness of voluntary muscle power, and with involuntary and sometimes painful spasms of limbs. A physiotherapist can help to reduce spasticity and avoid the development of contractures with techniques such as passive stretching. Nabiximols is safe and effective for relieving spacticity. There is evidence, albeit limited, of the clinical effectiveness of baclofen, dantrolene, diazepam, and tizanidine. In <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>complicated</b> cases intrathecal injections of baclofen can be used. There are also palliative measures like castings, splints or customized seatings.|$|E

50|$|Japan {{has one of}} <b>the</b> world's <b>most</b> <b>complicated</b> {{taxation}} systems, {{with its}} property tax provisions deserving specific mention. These provisions have been widely abused for speculation and have contributed to costlier land, especially within urban areas.|$|R

25|$|Operating system {{development}} {{is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>complicated</b> activities in which a computing hobbyist may engage. A hobby operating system may be classified as one whose code has not been directly derived from an existing operating system, and has few users and active developers.|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of the efficiency of an event selection is always {{an important part of}} the analysis of experimental data. The statistical techniques which are needed to determine the efficiency and its uncertainty are reviewed. Frequentist and Bayesian approaches are illustrated, and the problem of choosing a meaningful prior is explicitly addressed. Several practical use cases are considered, from the problem of combining different samples to complex situations in which non-unit weights or non-independent selections have been used. The Bayesian approach allows to find analytical expressions which solve even <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>complicate</b> problems, which make use of the family of Beta distributions, the conjugate priors for the binomial sampling...|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>complicated</b> {{aspect of}} the {{insurance}} business is the actuarial science of ratemaking (price-setting) of policies, which uses statistics and probability to approximate the rate of future claims based on a given risk. After producing rates, the insurer will use discretion to reject or accept risks through the underwriting process.|$|E
25|$|A bra {{is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>complicated</b> {{articles}} of clothing to make. A typical bra design has between 20 and 48 parts, including the band, hooks, cups, lining, and straps. Major retailers place orders from manufacturers in batches of 10,000. Orders of this size require a large-scale operation to manage the cutting, sewing and packing required.|$|E

It's certainly the longest I've ever played, and I've played quite a few. However, EiA has also been <b>the</b> <b>most</b> exciting, engrossing, and rewarding board-gaming experience of my life." ...|$|R

25|$|Analog {{computers}} were {{widely used in}} scientific and industrial applications where digital computers of the time lacked sufficient performance. Analog computers can have a very wide range of complexity. Slide rules and nomographs are the simplest, while naval gunfire control computers and large hybrid digital/analog {{computers were}} among <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>complicated.</b> Systems for process control and protective relays used analog computation to perform control and protective functions.|$|E
25|$|Creating {{the music}} for the series was a {{deliberate}} attempt to deviate from the standard for animated cartoons, which traditionally followed the works of Carl Stalling. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>complicated</b> piece of music created for the series was for the opening sequence, which was recorded preceding animation, rather than the typical method of composing it afterward. Newman's scat singing plays over transitions in the series. The show also incorporated homemade sound effects.|$|E
