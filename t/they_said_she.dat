25|$|Syrian state media said Nicole Mansfield, {{a single}} mother from the Midwestern city of Flint, Michigan, was killed with two others in an ambush by Syrian {{government}} forces on an opposition mission in northwestern Syria. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> was with a rebel group, {{but it was not}} clear which one.|$|E
25|$|Rosa later faces {{financial}} {{trouble with the}} restaurant and George offers her help, which she accepts. After Nicky claims she was assaulted by her mathematics tutor Rod Morris (Forbes Masson) and later admits she didn't tell the whole truth (but was still assaulted) and then dissowns the family when <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> was lying, Rosa decides the whole family should leave Walford to move to Leicester and besides Beppe the entire family leaves Walford in August 2000. Rosa dies {{from a heart attack}} two years later at the age of 50. Beppe then later joins the rest of his family in Leicester.|$|E

6000|$|... 'It is {{not real}} green. Blue, red, and yellow are the pragmatic colours,' said Ada, with a most triumphant air. 'Now are not <b>they,</b> Maurice?' <b>said</b> <b>she,</b> turning to her brother, who was, as usual, deep in entomology.|$|R
50|$|The French were {{impressed}} by her appearance despite saying her skin was too tanned. <b>They</b> also <b>said</b> <b>she</b> was a quiet girl. Upon hearing of this meeting at Lyon, Philip IV {{is said to have}} said the marriage would not happen..|$|R
25|$|The events {{surrounding}} Corrie's death are disputed. Fellow ISM activists {{said that the}} soldier operating the bulldozer deliberately ran Corrie over while she was acting as a human shield to prevent the demolition of the home of local pharmacist Samir Nasrallah. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> was between the bulldozer and a wall near Nasrallah's home, in which ISM activists {{had spent the night}} several times. Israeli eyewitnesses maintain that the death was accidental because the bulldozer operator was unable to see Corrie due to the vehicle's obstructed view. Furthermore, Israeli witnesses maintain that Corrie was not defending a house from being demolished and was instead inhibiting a military operation to find contraband weapons and smuggling tunnels in Gaza. An IDF officer testified in court that on that day they were only clearing vegetation and rubble from houses that were previously demolished, and that no new houses were slated for demolition.|$|E
500|$|Nick Harris of {{newspaper}} The Independent compared the Rangers Football Club's makeover to hers. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> was a [...] "geeky girl wearing mumsy sweaters" [...] before a [...] "glamour puss" [...] and joked she looked [...] "knock-down gorgeous – At least by late 1980s Ramsay Street standards." [...] Entertainment website Lowculture {{published an article}} criticising various soap operas for using each other's storyline, in which they brand Jane's [...] "geek makeover" [...] as {{the most famous of}} all and that other storylines of the same nature, are repetitive.|$|E
500|$|On March 2, {{the defense}} argued {{in court that}} Cisneros should be set free on bond during the trial {{because she did not}} pose a flight risk as {{demonstrated}} by her actions during the first trial. The defense stated that she never failed to appear in court during the 1994 trial even though she was facing a possible death penalty. In addition, <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> was a long-time resident of Brownsville and had no previous criminal history. Though Cisneros was aware of the FBI investigation, and the possibility of a new indictment against her, she had not fled, thus justifying her bond. On March 9, Cisneros was released from jail on a US$300,000 bond. The court ruled for the defense after deciding that she would not attempt to flee before the trial. [...] Court officials imposed certain restrictions on her freedom, however. They asked her to hand over her U.S. passport and to limit her travel to the Brownsville and McAllen, Texas judicial districts. Her husband was also required to sign a document that made him a third-party custodian.|$|E

2500|$|Bree, like Ashley, has {{not spoken}} to Castor since the trial. Bree said that though losing {{her mother was}} hard, [...] "I was happy that <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> was guilty, because {{we all know that}} she's guilty." [...] Ashley said, [...] "I would have done {{anything}} for her. But she tried to kill me instead." [...] Both of Castor's daughters expressed concern that their mother had not yet apologized to them. Castor maintains she is innocent of the deaths of her husbands and the attempted murder of Ashley.|$|E
2500|$|New York Times {{columnist}} Joe Nocera continued this argument. He {{also took}} issue with how the book was promoted by the 'Murdoch Empire' as a [...] "newly discovered" [...] novel, attesting that {{the other people in}} the Sothebys meeting insisted that Lee's attorney was present in 2011, when Lee's former agent (who was subsequently fired) and the Sotheby's specialist found the manuscript. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> knew full well that it was the same one submitted to Tay Hohoff in the 1950s that was reworked into Mockingbird, and that Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter had been sitting on the discovery, waiting for the moment when she, and not Alice, would be in charge of Harper Lee's affairs.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2000, Jones {{revealed}} {{that she would}} pose for nude pictures in an adult magazine, saying she {{wanted to use the}} money to pay taxes and support her grade-school-aged children, in particular saying, [...] "I'm wanting to put them through college and maybe set up a college fund." [...] Coulter publicly denounced Jones, calling her [...] "the trailer-park trash <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> was" [...] (Coulter had earlier chastened Clinton supporters for calling Jones this name), after Clinton's former campaign strategist James Carville had made the widely reported remark, [...] "Drag a $100 bill through a trailer park, and you'll never know what you'll find," [...] and called Jones a [...] "fraud, at least to the extent of pretending to be an honorable and moral person." ...|$|E
60|$|While these {{negotiations}} were going on, the embassadors asked permission {{to see the}} princess. This at first the king and queen, Isabella's father and mother, declined. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> was only {{eight or nine years}} old, and that such a child would not know at all how to conduct at such an interview.|$|R
60|$|In April a well-to-do {{storekeeper}} from {{an adjacent}} village began to court Bessy Houghton. He was over fifty, {{and had never}} been a handsome man in his best days, but Lynnfield oracles opined that Bessy would take him. She couldn't expect to do any better, <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> and <b>she</b> was looking terribly old and dowdy all at once.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{clerk in}} the book-department that died from asphyxiation--I {{wonder if it}} was accident, after all. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> so, but <b>she</b> was so unhappy and all when she talked to me at lunch.|$|R
2500|$|... "Gold" [...] was {{released}} {{as the second}} single on May 11, 2012. It peaked at number ten, and was certified platinum by ARIA. There was some controversy surrounding the song. Carmen Smith who contributes significant vocals to the track, although not credited as a featured artist, was disqualified as a contestant from The Voice for appearing in the video. Smith had worked with Sebastian for years, and later stated The Voice producers were aware of this, {{and that she had}} a clause in her contract which allowed her to continue to perform and record with him. She thought appearing in the video would be permitted under her contract. However <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> was breaking the [...] "spirit" [...] of the rules, as it might give her an unfair advantage over the other contestants." ...|$|E
2500|$|Political figures giving {{tribute to}} Rivers {{included}} {{former first lady}} Nancy Reagan, who had helped Rivers {{after the death of}} her husband, Edgar Rosenberg. As a friend of Prince Charles, Rivers was one of only four Americans invited to his wedding to Camilla Parker Bowles in 2005. Upon hearing of her death, <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> was [...] "utterly irreplaceable". Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu noted that besides bringing laughter to {{millions of people around the}} world, she was [...] "proud of her Jewish heritage". Future U.S. President Donald Trump attended her funeral and tweeted that she [...] "was an amazing woman and a great friend". After her mother's death, Melissa Rivers said she received a letter from President Barack Obama in which he wrote, despite being a frequent target of Rivers' jokes: [...] "not only did she make us laugh, she made us think".|$|E

60|$|You can't {{think how}} pleased Peter {{was to learn}} that all the people outside the gates knew about him. He begged Maimie {{to tell him what}} they knew and what <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> and <b>she</b> did so. They were sitting by this time on a fallen tree; Peter had cleared off the snow for Maimie, but he sat on a snowy bit himself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But how {{beautiful}} <b>they</b> are!' <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> in a muffled voice. Then, with a strange, suddenly revealed passion, she stooped and kissed Winifred.|$|R
6000|$|And yet, ef she hadn't been spiled, she was {{harmless}} {{enough in}} her [...] way; [...] She could jabber in French to her dad, and <b>they</b> <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> knew [...] how to play; [...] And she worked me that shot-pouch up thar, which the man doesn't [...] live ez kin use; [...] And slippers--you see 'em down 'yer--ez would cradle an Injin's [...] papoose.|$|R
6000|$|... "That skills not. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> made strange cures by {{no rules}} of art. Ay, and said her prayers backward, and had unknown books." ...|$|E
6000|$|Yet {{none of her}} intimates in {{the school}} and in the boarding-house knew of her abyss of passion. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> was [...] "so optimistic." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{shocking}} bad form!" [...] exclaimed Primrose. [...] "Just like cads of girls," [...] muttered Fergus, unheard; for Thekla continued--"Why, <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> must be our maiden aunt, {{instead of}} our sister." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For if <b>they</b> do," [...] <b>said</b> <b>she,</b> [...] "it {{may happen}} to you, {{as it has}} to me, that the iron-hearted King Pluto will take a liking to your darlings, and snatch them up in his chariot, and carry them away." ...|$|R
50|$|The Circle meets Lucy as <b>they</b> <b>said</b> and <b>she</b> guides {{them through}} a spell. The spell though instead of {{activating}} the medallion, it's absorbing the magic from {{the members of the}} Circle. When they realize that, Cassie uses the medallion to scare Lucy and make her tell them why she is really in town. Lucy admits the truth and Cassie lets her go with a message for the witch hunters.|$|R
60|$|She {{asked them}} about the social life in the village, and they told her that a good many new people had really settled there, {{but they did not}} know whether she would like them; they were not the old Hatboro' style. Annie showed them some of the things she had brought home, {{especially}} Roman views, and <b>they</b> <b>said</b> now <b>she</b> ought to give an evening in the church parlour with them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not, my lord. I remember, <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> {{was called}} the Ca Ira; and I always {{supposed}} {{that it was the}} name of some old Greek or Roman--or, perhaps, of one of their new-fangled republican saints." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her {{answers to}} the {{kindness}} and the remarks of her companions were at first unconsciously given. They had travelled half their way along the rough lane, before she was quite awake to what <b>they</b> <b>said.</b> <b>She</b> then found them talking of [...] "Frederick." ...|$|E

5000|$|There was no International Classification of European two-year-olds in 1976: the {{official}} handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. Olwyn {{was not given}} a rating in either the British or French handicaps.
