2500|$|As {{part of the}} post-September 11 drive towards {{increased}} capability in {{homeland security}} and public health preparedness, traditional GC-MS units with transmission quadrupole mass spectrometers, {{as well as those}} with cylindrical ion trap (CIT-MS) and toroidal ion trap (T-ITMS) mass spectrometers have been modified for field portability and near real-time detection of chemical warfare agents (CWA) such as sarin, soman, and VX. [...] These complex and large GC-MS systems have been modified and configured with resistively heated low thermal mass (LTM) gas chromatographs that reduce analysis time to less than ten percent of the time required in traditional laboratory systems. [...] Additionally, the systems are smaller, and more mobile, including units that are mounted in mobile analytical laboratories (MAL), such as those used by the United States Marine Corps Chemical and Biological Incident Response Force MAL and other similar laboratories, and systems that are hand-carried by two-person teams or individuals, much ado to the smaller mass detectors.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a <b>thermal</b> vacuum <b>desorption</b> process to rapidly extract water from environmental samples for tritium analysis. <b>Thermal</b> vacuum <b>desorption</b> allows for extraction of the moisture from the sample {{within a few hours}} in a form and quantity suitable for liquid scintillation counting and allows detection of tritium at the levels of < 2 Bq/L of milk, < 0. 5 Bq/gm of vegetation, and < 0. 5 Bq/gin of soil. We developed a prototype unit that can process batches of twenty or more samples within 24 hours. Early data shows that a high percentage of water is extracted reproducibly without enrichment or depletion of the tritium content.

There is also significant variation in the competing rates out of the physisorbed state into chemisorption at the various surface sites, which we attribute to differences in site-specific Arrhenius pre-factors.
