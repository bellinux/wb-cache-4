5|$|In the Truman Study is a {{fireplace}} mantel that was originally {{installed in the}} White House. It was removed to Blair House during Truman's occupancy, when he used this room as his personal office. In 1987, <b>the</b> <b>mantel</b> was refinished in white enamel with gold-leaf accents. In 2004, before the state funeral of Ronald Reagan, Nancy Reagan used the Truman Study to receive visitors.|$|E
5|$|Since its predecessor's {{inception}} in 1953, Burger King has used several variations of franchising {{to expand its}} operations. In the United States, the company originally relied on a regional franchise model with owners having exclusive expansion rights in a defined geographic territory. This model proved to be problematic as it led to issues of food quality, procedures and image management. A 1970s attempt by one of its largest franchises {{to take over the}} chain led to a restructuring of its franchising system, tossing the old method in favor of a restricted, per store licensing model. The 1978 restructuring, led by a new director of operations, firmly placed <b>the</b> <b>mantel</b> of franchise oversight on the shoulders of the company.|$|E
5|$|Sutherst {{said the}} scratch marks {{appeared}} in photographs taken on 10 September 1985, 34 {{days after the}} murders, but were not visible in the original crime-scene photographs. He also said {{he had failed to}} find in the photographs any chipped paint on the carpet below the mantelpiece, where it might have been expected to fall had the mantelpiece been scratched during a struggle. He was asked by the CCRC to examine a red spot on the carpet visible in photographs underneath the scratches on the mantelpiece. He said the red spot matched a piece of nail varnish missing from one of Sheila's toes. He concluded that the scratch marks on <b>the</b> <b>mantel</b> had been created after the day of the murders.|$|E
25|$|A Helmet with {{a medieval}} student on top, {{in a green}} coat, doubled gold and yellow, a sword on his right side. In the left hand, he has a flag with a golden cross on a red shield {{containing}} the letters C and V surrounded by a green wreath. In the left hand he has a red book. <b>The</b> <b>manteling</b> {{is made in the}} colors green, dubbled silver on the left side, dubbled red and gold on the right side. in <b>the</b> <b>manteling</b> is a white ribbon with the motto.|$|R
50|$|The single-story wings {{were built}} in the 1930s. The east wing has two rooms with a fireplace. The west wing has three rooms. Two of these have fireplaces. The wings use a Greek Revival style for <b>the</b> <b>mantels</b> and woodwork. <b>The</b> rear hallway extends along the north side of each wing.|$|R
60|$|Virginia {{raised her}} eyes to the {{painting}} on the wall over <b>the</b> marble <b>mantel.</b> <b>The</b> face under the heavy coils of brown hair was sweet and gentle, delicately feminine. It had an expression of sorrow that seemed a prophecy.|$|R
5|$|The cousins {{went back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to search for the source of the red paint on the silencer. In the kitchen they found marks in the red paint {{on the underside of the}} mantelpiece above the Aga cooker. DI Cook, a scenes-of-crime officer, took a paint sample from the mantelpiece on 14 August. This was found to contain the same 15 layers of paint and varnish that were in the paint flake found on the silencer. Casts were taken of the marks on <b>the</b> <b>mantel,</b> and the marks were deemed consistent with the silencer having come into contact several times with the mantelpiece. The implication was that the silencer had scratched the mantelpiece during a fight for the gun.|$|E
5|$|The {{locations}} are themed around {{the idea of}} a traditional Southern U.S. general store. Items used to decorate each store are authentic artifacts, including everyday objects from the early 1900s and after. Each restaurant features a front porch lined with wooden rocking chairs, a wooden peg solitaire game on every table, and a stone fireplace with a deer head displayed above <b>the</b> <b>mantel.</b> In fact, each location has five common items: a shotgun, a cookstove, a deer head, a telephone, and a traffic light. The peg games have been present in Cracker Barrel since the opening of the first store, and continue to be produced by the same family in Lebanon, Tennessee. The decor at each location typically includes artifacts related to the local history of the area, including antique household tools, old wall calendars and advertising posters, and antique photographs; these are centrally stored in a warehouse in Tennessee, where they are cataloged and stockpiled for future use by individual store locations.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally {{paintings}} of both presidents Roosevelt have {{hung in the}} room. Even before President Nixon's formal naming of the Roosevelt Room a tradition existed of Democratic administrations hanging Alfred Jonniaux's portrait of FDR over <b>the</b> <b>mantel</b> with Theodore Roosevelt's equestrian portrait by Tade Styka titled Rough Rider hung on the south wall. Republican administrations would, in turn, hang Teddy Roosevelt's painting above <b>the</b> <b>mantel</b> and move FDR's portrait to the south wall. Bill Clinton decided to keep the landscape formatted Teddy Roosevelt portrait above <b>the</b> <b>mantel</b> and FDR's portrait on the south wall.|$|E
25|$|Inside, the house's decor {{reflects}} later Victorian stylings, {{due to the}} era {{in which}} it was rebuilt. The walls are plaster on lath; the floorboards are thin oak. The woodwork, particularly <b>the</b> <b>mantels,</b> use Eastlake decorative motifs. In the hallway next to the main staircase is the church's safe. The basement is, like the church's, unfinished.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} the Scott Mansion, the William A. Scott House was built in 1883 in the Stick-Eastlake style used by its neighbors. Among the {{hallmarks}} of the style are its paired front windows, narrow horizontal clapboarding, and imbricated chingles at the peak. Inside, <b>the</b> <b>mantels</b> and interior doorways are cunningly crafted, along with the chamfering on numerous edges and the parquet flooring.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{many of the}} {{original}} details of the home have been replaced, {{there are still some}} remaining pieces. The decorative iron gates from the open-air elevator can be viewed from the basement restaurant. In the office where William Lemp, Jr. committed suicide, there is still an Italian marble <b>mantel.</b> <b>The</b> ceiling in the parlor is hand-painted, and <b>the</b> <b>mantels</b> are intricately carved African mahogany. [...] The main bathroom includes a glass-enclosed shower that Lemp brought back to St. Louis from an Italian hotel. [...] The three vaults where the Lemps stored their art pieces are located {{in the rear of the}} home.|$|R
25|$|Social Arts Club mantel & {{furniture}} – library table, console, chairs, map case – (1878), {{designed by}} Frank Furness. Renamed the Rittenhouse Club, it sold the clubhouse in the 1990s, and auctioned off <b>the</b> <b>mantel</b> and furniture.|$|E
25|$|During the 90's Kevin Williams {{took over}} <b>the</b> <b>mantel</b> and {{has run the}} Junior section without fault. He has raised the junior {{membership}} to figures never realised {{in the past and}} has gained sponsorship for all teams. As a result of all his hard work the club is now seeing the youth moving into the grades and staying with the club.|$|E
25|$|Conger {{used the}} {{workshop}} of Franco Scalamandré for textiles, keeping {{the motif of}} medallions and scrolls, but changed the red color used by the Kennedys to a warmer more scarlet shade of red. On the south wall of the room between two windows a large gilded bracket was installed to hold a bust of President Martin Van Buren carved by Hiram Powers. A portrait of Van Buren's daughter-in-law, Angelica Singleton Van Buren, painted in 1842 by Henry Inman hangs above <b>the</b> <b>mantel.</b> The portrait includes {{a representation of the}} marble bust.|$|E
5000|$|Inside, {{the house}} was divided into two {{principal}} rooms per floor, with a central hallway for the stairs. Few original fittings survive; <b>the</b> <b>mantels</b> and wainscoting were removed, as were some floorboards from the second floor. Part of the first-level floor had fallen in. Portions of the stairway survived, as did the north-exterior door. [...] The walls were once plastered, {{but much of the}} covering has disintegrated over time.|$|R
40|$|Mantel's test (MT) for {{association}} is conducted by testing the linear relationship of similarity of all pairs of subjects between two observational domains. Motivated by applications to neuroimaging and genetics data, {{and following the}} succes of shrinkage and kernel methods for prediction with high-dimensional data, we here introduce <b>the</b> adaptive <b>Mantel</b> test {{as an extension of}} the MT. By utilizing kernels and penalized similarity measures, <b>the</b> adaptive <b>Mantel</b> test is able to achieve higher statistical power relative to the classical MT in many settings. Furthermore, <b>the</b> adaptive <b>Mantel</b> test is designed to simultaneously test over multiple similarity measures such that the correct type I error rate under the null hypothesis is maintained without the need to directly adjust the significance threshold for multiple testing. The performance of <b>the</b> adaptive <b>Mantel</b> test is evaluated on simulated data, and is used to investigate associations between genetics markers related to Alzheimer's Disease and heatlhy brain physiology with data from a working memory study of 350 college students from Beijing Normal University...|$|R

25|$|The President's House, {{built in}} 1921 and {{designed}} by architect Louis Bowman of McKim, Mead & White, {{is an example}} of 16th century Tudor-style architecture. Its living room features restored carved beams, representing the various trades, from a 16th-century Tudor mansion in England. Additionally, above <b>the</b> <b>mantel</b> a Christian creation story is told in intricate wood carving. Campus legend dictates that a secret panel exists in the living room leading to a wine cellar, which was built during Prohibition. The President's House has housed the College's presidents since 1954, when the first President's House, located north of campus, was demolished {{to make way for the}} Sprain Brook Parkway.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the wall hangings, McKim, Meade & White commissioned {{a wide range of}} other furnishings more in line with their Louis XVI style salon de famille style. Marcotte and Co. supplied heavy velvet gold drapes, and topped each window with carved and gilded cornices of the company's own design. The existing pier tables were removed, and four richly carved and gilded Louis XVI Revival style console tables, also designed by Marcotte & Co., were placed between the pilasters. The existing seating was also removed, and Marcotte & Co. replaced it with 13 Louis XVI Revival gilded banquettes (upholstered benches). Marcotte & Co. also supplied new ornate gilded frames for each over-mantel mirror. A few items in the room were reused, however. These included <b>the</b> <b>mantel</b> candelabra, manufactured by Russell & LaFarge and purchased in the Monroe administration in 1817.|$|E
25|$|Butterfield also oversaw {{installation}} of the taping system which Nixon ordered for the White House. On February 10, 1971, Haldeman's assistant, Larry Higby, told Butterfield that president Nixon wanted a voice-activated audio taping system installed in the Oval Office and on White House telephones. The goal, Nixon said, {{was to create a}} more accurate record of events. Butterfield worked with the Secret Service to install five hidden microphones in Nixon's desk, two in lamps on <b>the</b> <b>mantel</b> over the fireplace, two in the cabinet room, and on all telephone lines in the Lincoln Sitting Room and the Oval Office. According to Butterfield, the system was highly secret, its existence known only to Nixon, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Higby, the three or four Secret Service technical staffers who installed it, and him. In April 1971, Nixon ordered the taping system installed in his private office in the Executive Office Building.|$|E
50|$|Heavy {{crowds in}} the White House during the Jackson {{administration}} left the mansion in shabby condition. President Martin Van Buren purchased a new, 30 ft {{table for the}} State Dining Room, and reupholstered the chairs in blue satin fabric. Blue and yellow drapes and rugs complimented the chairs. At some point, <b>the</b> <b>mantels</b> over <b>the</b> fireplace had been replaced with new ones of black marble, and three chandeliers now lit the room.|$|R
60|$|Upon <b>the</b> <b>mantels,</b> and on many {{shelves and}} {{brackets}} and tables, were clustered ornaments of every description, seemingly {{made out of}} all sorts of metals, glass, china, stones and marbles. There were vases, and figures of men and animals, and graven platters and bowls, and mosaics of precious gems, and many other things. Pictures, too, were on the walls, and the underground palace was quite a museum of rare and curious and costly objects.|$|R
5000|$|Construction {{lasted from}} August 1919 to May 1921. The general {{contractor}} was W.O. Heckart of Eugene. Washington Brick of Spokane did the brick, Rushlight and Hastorf did the heating, City Iron Works in Portland did the ironwork, and Standard Artificial Stone Company of Portland did the cast stone. The carvines on <b>the</b> <b>mantels</b> and <b>the</b> grand stairway {{were based on}} designs done by students in the Art Department and Professor Larry Schroff did the over-mantel paintings ...|$|R
25|$|Hunting parties {{left their}} towns after the growing season, moving up {{tributary}} streams to temporary camps {{through the winter}} in the state. Local legends suggest the hunt had a religious aspect.). The Riparian zone on the lower western drainage of the Allegheny Mountains has some creek bottoms which were covered over with shallow beaver lakes. At the base of these hills is <b>the</b> <b>mantel</b> created by watering animals {{at the edge of}} the beaver lake. The narrower bottom creeks become brooks flowing around cliff ridge-lines and rolling hills on enveloped terraces feeding the bottomland of major rivers. Along the bottom land and terrace of slower moving waters, the Late Prehistoric farming Indian had lived and canoed. Occasionally, an earlier hunter's point from antiquity can be found around these mantels, which are distant from today's dryer creek beds across plowable bottoms. With the exception of elk and mountain lion, absent today, these bowmen hunted today's game.|$|E
25|$|Ford was {{renowned for}} his intense {{personality}} and his many idiosyncrasies and eccentricities. From the early Thirties onwards, he always wore dark {{glasses and a}} patch over his left eye, which was only partly to protect his poor eyesight. He was an inveterate pipe-smoker {{and while he was}} shooting he would chew on a linen handkerchief—each morning his wife would give him a dozen fresh handkerchiefs, {{but by the end of}} a day's filming the corners of all of them would be chewed to shreds. He always had music played on the set and would routinely break for tea (Earl Grey) at mid-afternoon every day during filming. He discouraged chatter and disliked bad language on set; its use, especially in front of a woman, would typically result in the offender being thrown off the production. He rarely drank during the making of a film, but when a production wrapped he would often lock himself in his study, wrapped only in a sheet, and go on a solitary drinking binge for several days, followed by routine contrition and a vow never to drink again. He was extremely sensitive to criticism and was always particularly angered by any comparison between his work and that of his older brother Francis. He rarely attended premieres or award ceremonies, although his Oscars and other awards were proudly displayed on <b>the</b> <b>mantel</b> in his home.|$|E
500|$|Cukor {{himself was}} highly {{dissatisfied}} by the film. [...] "I suspect {{the story was}} basically fraudulent," [...] he told an interviewer. Like many critics, he felt that [...] "as a piece of storytelling, the unfolding of a mystery, {{the first half of}} Keeper of the Flame is a damn good show", {{but the rest of the}} film had substantial problems. He praised Spencer Tracy's work, saying: [...] "Tracy... was at his best in the picture. Subdued, cool, he conveyed the ruthlessness of the reporter sent to investigate Forrest's death without seeming to try. He was ideally cast in the role, grimly and skeptically exploring the secret of the dead boys' club hero who was in fact a rampant fascist." [...] Hepburn, he felt, was hindered by the role and her approach to it. [...] "It was Kate's last romantic glamour-girl part, and she acted with some of that artificiality she'd supposedly left behind at RKO. That first scene, floating into a room in yards and yards of draperies with these lillies—well, it was all far, far too much. I don't think I really believed in the story, it was pure hokeypokey, and her part was phony, highfalutin." [...] He particularly disliked Hepburn's entrance in the film, with the long dress and lillies. But he felt Hepburn did her best: [...] "That's awfully tricky isn't it? And doesn't she give long, piercing looks at his portrait over <b>the</b> <b>mantel?</b> Well. I think she finally carried a slightly phony part because her humanity asserted itself, and her humor. They always did." [...] Overall, though, Cukor felt the film was leaden, and that it had [...] "a wax work quality". Even screenwriter Stewart eventually came to feel the film was [...] "tedious, wooden, and heavy-handed".|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{furniture}} in the East Room was removed by Boudin to make the room appear to be of a single historic era. The 1902 console tables {{were removed from the}} piers between the windows, and the 1902 Louis XVI style floor lamps moved out of the corners and in front of the piers. The 1952 Adam-style camelback sofas were removed at the instigation of du Pont, and replaced with gilt benches. Research conducted by White House Curator Lorraine Waxman Pearce and Jacqueline Kennedy identified the four Monroe-era candelabra (which had been moved), and restored them to <b>the</b> <b>mantels</b> in <b>the</b> room's southern wall. Early 19th-century crystal candelabra (of an indeterminate manufacture) were placed on <b>the</b> <b>mantels</b> on <b>the</b> room's northern wall. To compliment the paintings of George and Martha Washington, Jacqueline Kennedy was loaned portraits of a young Bushrod Washington (George Washington's nephew and an Associate Supreme Court Justice) and his wife, Julia Ann Blackburn Washington. These portraits by Chester Harding were hung on the east wall. Kennedy's friend, Jayne Wrightsman, donated two early 19th-century wall sconces, which were wired for electricity by White House staff and hung {{on either side of the}} center window.|$|R

[...] Other distinctive features include transoms over all interior doorways in the house's southern portion and a walnut log in the attic, which was a traditional element used to bring good luck to the house.|$|E
2500|$|A bright {{fire was}} {{burning in the}} grate, casting golden patches that danced over the ceiling and the walls. The room was thus {{illuminated}} by a brilliant, vacillating glow which dimmed the lamp set on a table. Madame Raquin had tried to arrange the room attractively, all white and scented, as though {{to serve as a}} nest for young lovers; the old shopkeeper had chosen to add to the bed a few bits of lace and to fill the vases on <b>the</b> <b>mantel</b> with big bouquets of roses. A gentle warmth lingered in the air, with soft odors.|$|E
