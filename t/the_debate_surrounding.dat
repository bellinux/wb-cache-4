5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, I. C. Filitti {{worked with the}} {{formerly}} Junimist tribune Convorbiri Literare, which published fragments of his research on Maiorescu (1922) and novelist Costache Negruzzi (1923). Filitti subsequently {{turned his attention to}} some of the earliest sources on Wallachian history, adding his opinion to <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>surrounding</b> the historicity of Negru Vodă (described by some early modern sources as Wallachia's state-builder). His topical study, published by in the 1924 Romanian Academy annals, concluded that Negru Vodă was in fact the stuff of legend, concocted by the 17th-century Wallachian Lord Matei Basarab. The next year, he returned to social history, with the book Clasele sociale în trecutul românesc ("Social Classes in the Romanian Past"). It mainly explained the difference between the concepts of nobility in Western Europe, on one hand, and the Danubian Principalities, on the other: Moldo-Wallachian nobility had no concept of knighthood, as all boyars were defined by their demesnes.|$|E
5|$|Moving to Northern California, McNallen began {{a career}} as a school teacher; during the summer {{vacations}} he travelled the world as a military journalist, writing articles for Soldier of Fortune magazine. Concerned by what he saw as the growth of liberal, universalist ideas in Heathenry, he returned to active involvement in the Heathen movement in the mid-1990s, establishing the Asatrú Folk Assembly, which was headquartered in Grass Valley, California. In 1997 he was involved in the establishment of the International Asatru/Odinist Alliance alongside Murray's AA and the British Odinic Rite. He brought greater attention to his group after they became involved in <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>surrounding</b> the Kennewick Man, arguing that it constituted evidence for a European presence in prehistoric America. In the 21st century he became more politically active, becoming involved in both environmentalist campaigns and a group promoting the rights of European Americans.|$|E

25|$|Beatus was {{directly}} involved in <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>surrounding</b> adoptionism, which argued that Jesus was born a man, and was adopted by God and acquired a divine dimension only after his passion and resurrection. Beatus refuted this theological position, championed by such figures as Elipando, bishop of Toledo.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>surrounding</b> the Constitution's {{ratification}} is {{of practical}} importance, particularly to adherents of originalist and strict constructionist legal theories.

25|$|Having {{discussed}} Plato's philosophy, linguistics, perception, {{and some}} cognitive structures, various implications {{that arise from}} the research and theorizing can be touched on. <b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>surrounding</b> how to define knowledge {{goes back to the}} origin of humanity. In historical philosophy, the debate has been between rationalism and empiricism. In contemporary psychology, the debate is between biology (nature) and environment (nurture).|$|E

25|$|Along with <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>surrounding</b> Tilted Arc, Serra's {{public image}} has been further {{affected}} by two accidents. In November 1971, 34-year-old Raymond Johnson, a laborer installing Serra's Sculpture No. 3 at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, was crushed to death when a two-ton steel plate toppled over on him. A subsequent lawsuit absolved {{the artist and}} museum of blame. In October 1989, another worker lost a leg while dismantling a 16-ton Serra sculpture at the Leo Castelli Gallery.|$|E
25|$|Regarding {{the issue}} of whether the breadth of infant {{attachment}} functioning can be captured by a categorical classification scheme, {{it should be noted that}} continuous measures of attachment security have been developed which have demonstrated adequate psychometric properties. These have been used either individually or in conjunction with discrete attachment classifications in many published reports. The original Richter's et al. (1998) scale is strongly related to secure versus insecure classifications, correctly predicting about 90% of cases. Readers further interested in the categorical versus continuous nature of attachment classifications (and <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>surrounding</b> this issue) should consult a paper by Fraley and Spieker and the rejoinders in the same issue by many prominent attachment researchers including J. Cassidy, A. Sroufe, E. Waters & T. Beauchaine, and M. Cummings.|$|E
25|$|As one of {{the largest}} growing {{concerns}} American adults have of current Internet privacy policies, identity and credit theft remain a constant figure in <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>surrounding</b> privacy online. A 1997 study by the Boston Consulting Group showed that participants of the study were most concerned about their privacy on the Internet compared to any other media. However, it is important to recall that these issues are not the only prevalent concerns our society has. Though some may call it a modern-day version of McCarthyism, another prevalent issue also remains members of our own society sending disconcerting emails to one another. It is for this reason in 2001 that for {{one of the}} first times ever the public demonstrated an approval of government intervention in their private lives.|$|E

25|$|TMRCA {{calculations}} {{are considered}} critical evidence {{when attempting to}} determine migration dates of various populations as they spread around the world. For example, if a mutation is deemed to have occurred 30,000 years ago, then this mutation should be found amongst all populations that diverged after this date. If archeological evidence indicates cultural spread and formation of regionally isolated populations then this must {{be reflected in the}} isolation of subsequent genetic mutations in this region. If genetic divergence and regional divergence coincide it can be concluded that the observed divergence is due to migration as evidenced by the archaeological record. However, if the date of genetic divergence occurs at a different time than the archaeological record, then scientists will have to look at alternate archaeological evidence to explain the genetic divergence. The issue is best illustrated in <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>surrounding</b> the demic diffusion versus cultural diffusion during the European Neolithic.|$|E
500|$|Among {{critics of}} the 'Ethical Oil' {{point of view is}} Andrew Nikiforuk, author of Tar Sands: Dirty Oil and the Future of a Continent (Greystone Books, 2008, [...] ), who {{referred}} to Levant's reasoning as [...] "a classic Republican ruse", and dismissed Minister of the Environment Peter Kent's argument as an [...] "infomercial on bitumen". In The Guardian, Leo Hickman points out that China is a major investor in the Canadian oil sands, and asks [...] "Shouldn't this now mean that Canada's tar sands are labelled as 'Conflict Oil', too?" [...] Another opponent, Megan Leslie, the environment critic for the Official Opposition's New Democratic Party, said <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>surrounding</b> the ethics of Canadian oil sands [...] "misses the point" [...] and maintained that [...] "Canada should be working to move beyond fossil fuels toward renewable sources of energy".|$|E
500|$|Within {{the region}} {{originally}} demanded from Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany in 1938 was the important railway junction city of Bohumín (...) [...] The Poles regarded {{the city as}} of crucial importance to the area and to Polish interests. On 28 September, Edvard Beneš composed a note to the Polish administration offering to reopen <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>surrounding</b> the territorial demarcation in Těšínsko {{in the interest of}} mutual relations, but he delayed in sending it in hopes of good news from London and Paris, which came only in a limited form. Beneš then turned to the Soviet leadership in Moscow, which had begun a partial mobilisation in eastern Belarus and the Ukrainian SSR on 22 September and threatened Poland with the dissolution of the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact. The Czech government was offered 700 fighter planes if room for them could be found on the Czech airfields. On 28 September, all the military districts west of the Urals were ordered to stop releasing men for leave. On 29 September, 330,000 reservists were up throughout the western USSR.|$|E

500|$|The U.S., {{after the}} Spanish–American War, had many expansionists {{who wanted to}} annex Cuba. Many people felt that a foreign power (outside of the U.S.) would control a portion of Cuba, thus the U.S. could not {{continue}} with its interests in Cuba. Although many advocated annexation, this was prevented by the Teller Amendment, which states [...] "hereby disclaims any disposition of intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over said island except for pacification thereof, and asserts its determination, when that is accomplished, to leave the government {{and control of the}} island to its people." [...] When summarized, this could mean that the U.S. would not interfere with Cuba and its peoples. The expansionists argued though, that the Teller Amendment was created [...] "ignorant of actual conditions" [...] and that this released the U.S. from its obligation. Following <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>surrounding</b> the Teller Amendment, the Platt Amendment took effect. The Platt Amendment (the name is a misnomer; the Platt Amendment is actually a rider to the Army Appropriation Act of 1901) was accepted by Cuba in late 1901, after [...] "strong pressure" [...] from Washington. The Platt Amendment, summarized by Thomas A. Bailey in [...] "Diplomatic History of the American People": ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his later}} life Graham {{and his wife}} settled on the Gold Coast in Queensland and were {{involved}} in community activities and fundraising. He enjoyed swimming and fishing and was involved in work to help the blind. He died at his home on the Isle of Capri on 20 July 1996 and was survived by his widow and two sons. Despite <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>surrounding</b> the laying of the barrier minefield, McNeill and Ekins later described Graham as a [...] "clever and imaginative" [...] commander, who was [...] "widely regarded as {{having one of the}} best minds in the army", and whose [...] "broad knowledge and fair approach earned him the respect of his subordinates." [...] Yet even in death Graham remained a controversial figure. In his book, The Minefield, published in 2007, author and former Army officer Greg Lockhart argued that the decision to establish the minefield had been [...] "reckless"; the product of a failure to understand the prevailing nature of the insurgency in Phuoc Tuy Province, it had ended in [...] "strategic disaster". Lockhart argued that the decision ultimately cost Graham the position of CGS, even though he had been seen by some as being the likely candidate to replace Daly. He went on to describe Graham as ambitious and career-driven, [...] "...a talented man who rose to a position of some importance and was undone by inescapable personal flaws." ...|$|E
