50|$|For {{this purpose}} TermCoord keeps {{in contact with}} a large number of universities, {{terminology}} bodies and experts through its public website, as well as through its memberships in important associations, such as the European Association for Terminology (EAFT), the International Information Centre for Terminology (Infoterm), the International Network for Terminology (<b>TermNet)</b> and the Rat für Deutschsprachige Terminologie (RaDT). TermCoord's Facebook page is another important means of communication.|$|E
50|$|The DTT's {{mission is}} {{to find ways of}} {{improving}} technical communication through terminology management. It acts as a forum for discussing terminology issues and supports individuals, companies, and public agencies, domestic and foreign, in achieving their own terminological goals. The DTT cooperates with other organizations on terminology management matters, including the Council for German-Language Terminology (German Rat für deutschsprachige Terminologie), Infoterm, <b>TermNet,</b> the German technical communication association tekom, the Federal Association of Interpreters and Translators (German Bundesverband der Dolmetscher und Übersetzer e.V.) and the European Association for Terminology, among others.|$|E
40|$|In this contribution, {{we discuss}} and compare {{alternative}} options of modelling the entities and relations of wordnet-like {{resources in the}} Web Ontology Language OWL. Based on different modelling options, we developed three models of representing wordnets in OWL, i. e. the instance model, the dass model, and the metaclass model. These OWL models mainly differ {{with respect to the}} ontological Status of lexical units (word senses) and the synsets. While in the instance model lexical units and synsets are represented as individuals, in the dass model they are represented as classes; both model types can be encoded in the dialect OWL DL. As a third alternative, we developed a metaclass model in OWL FULL, in which lexical units and synsets are defined as metaclasses, the individuals of which are classes themselves. We apply the three OWL models to each of three wordnet-style resources: (1) a subset of the German wordnet GermaNet, (2) the wordnet-style domain ontology <b>TermNet,</b> and (3) GermaTermNet, in which <b>TermNet</b> technical terms and GermaNet synsets are connected by means of a set of “plug-in” relations. We report on the results of several experiments in which we evaluated the performance of querying and processing these different models: (1) A comparison of all three OWL models (dass, instance, and metaclass model) of <b>TermNet</b> in the context of automatic text-to-hypertext conversion, (2) an investigation of the potential of the GermaTermNet resource by the example of a wordnet-based semantic relatedness calculation...|$|E
40|$|The work {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} {{dynamics}} of the interaction between people. The theoretical basis of the research is the model of the dynamics of living systems activity, stating the existence of three phases of systems dynamics: <b>termnet,</b> affinity and involvement. The equivalents of these phrases in interpersonal communication are the following: prudence during interaction (equivalent to <b>termnet</b> phase), readiness to avow one’s goals (equivalent to affinity phase), readiness to plan united actions (equivalent to involvement phase). The goal of the research is to study the process of interaction between two persons {{from the perspective of the}} theory of dynamics of living systems activity. The participants were offered to enter into agreement during an hour. The time limit of their dialogue had three 20 -minute periods. The level of prudence, readiness to discuss goals and plan united actions were estimated every three time segments, using visual-analogue scale. The research was conducted in the group, involving 42 people. The obtained results showed that the communication structure, projected by the theory of dynamics activity seems to be convincing and can be used to describe communicative interactions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} modelling a general-language wordnet, GermaNet, and a domain-specific wordnet, <b>TermNet,</b> in the web ontology language OWL. While the modelling process for GermaNet adopts relevant recommendations {{with respect to the}} English Princeton WordNet, for Term-Net an alternative modelling concept is developed that considers the special characteristics of domain-specific terminologies. We present a proposal for linking a general-language wordnet and a terminological wordnet within the framework of OWL and on this basis discuss problems and alternative modelling approaches...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} “ 10 {{good reasons}} for terminology” in any expert field and any language(s) by discussing the areas of application in {{the public and the}} private sector as well as in science and education. After a short introduction on the history of terminology, the term “ontology” will be discussed, as one of the key terms in current knowledge engineering and terminology. The paper gives an overview on means and methods of assuring and improving the quality of knowledge generation, communication and management through terminology. Also, it introduces the main standards, players and experts in the terminology community, such as the International Network for Terminology (www. <b>termnet.</b> org) ...|$|E

Project coordinator was Tilde (Latvia), the project partners were: Institute for Information Management at Cologne University of Applied Sciences (Germany), Center for Language Technology at University of Copenhagen (Denmark), Institute of the Lithuanian Language (Lithuania), Terminology Commission of Latvian Academy of Science (Latvia), MorphoLogic (Hungary), University of Tartu (Estonia), Information Processing Center (Poland). EuroTermBank project {{has been focused on}} harmonization and consolidation of terminology work in new EU member states, transferring experience from other European Union terminology networks and accumulating competencies and efforts of the new EU countries. The result of the project is a centralized online term bank for languages of new EU member countries interlinked to other terminology banks and resources. The term bank is accessible via internet and it contains over 600 000 terminological entries, in which there are more than 1, 5 million terms in 25 languages. It has a link with four external data bases: <b>TermNet.</b> lv, OLSTEN, MoBiDic and Lietuvos Respublikos terminų bankas. In EuroTermBank there are over 78 000 Lithuanian terms and their equivalents in other languages from 11 sources. Terms in this term bank are arranged according to subject fields from Eurovoc – an official multilingual thesaurus of the European Union. The address of EuroTermBank web page is www. eurotermbank. com...|$|E
