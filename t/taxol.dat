5|$|The {{reaction}} {{has been}} used in a number of notable total syntheses including the Danishefsky <b>Taxol</b> total synthesis, which produces the chemotherapeutic drug <b>taxol,</b> and the Kuehne Strychnine total synthesis which produces the pesticide strychnine.|$|E
5|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry has {{roots in the}} apothecary shops of Europe in the 1800s, where pharmacists provided local traditional medicines to customers, which included extracts like morphine, quinine, and strychnine. Therapeutically important drugs like camptothecin (from Camptotheca acuminata, used in traditional Chinese medicine) and <b>taxol</b> (from the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia) were derived from medicinal plants. The Vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, used as anti-cancer drugs, were discovered in the 1950s from the Madagascar periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{and plants}} {{have evolved to}} {{synthesise}} {{a vast array of}} poisonous products including secondary metabolites, peptides and proteins that can act as inhibitors. Natural toxins are usually small organic molecules and are so diverse that there are probably natural inhibitors for most metabolic processes. The metabolic processes targeted by natural poisons encompass more than enzymes in metabolic pathways and can also include the inhibition of receptor, channel and structural protein functions in a cell. For example, paclitaxel (<b>taxol),</b> an organic molecule found in the Pacific yew tree, binds tightly to tubulin dimers and inhibits their assembly into microtubules in the cytoskeleton.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{application of}} samarium {{and its compounds}} is as catalyst and chemical reagent. Samarium catalysts assist decomposition of plastics, dechlorination of pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), {{as well as the}} dehydration and dehydrogenation of ethanol. Samarium(III) triflate (Sm(OTf)3, that is Sm(CF3SO3)3), {{is one of the most}} efficient Lewis acid catalysts for a halogen-promoted Friedel–Crafts reaction with alkenes. Samarium(II) iodide is a very common reducing and coupling agent in organic synthesis, for example in the desulfonylation reactions; annulation; Danishefsky, Kuwajima, Mukaiyama and Holton <b>Taxol</b> total syntheses; strychnine total synthesis; Barbier reaction and other reductions with samarium(II) iodide.|$|E
5|$|At least 120 drugs {{come from}} plant sources, {{many of them}} from the bark of trees. Quinine {{originates}} from the cinchona tree (Cinchona) and was for a long time the remedy of choice for the treatment of malaria. Aspirin was synthesised to replace the sodium salicylate derived from the bark of willow trees (Salix) which had unpleasant side effects. The anti-cancer drug Paclitaxel is derived from <b>taxol,</b> a substance found in the bark of the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia). Other tree based drugs come from the paw-paw (Carica papaya), the cassia (Cassia spp.), the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao), the tree of life (Camptotheca acuminata) and the downy birch (Betula pubescens).|$|E
5|$|Florida State University {{aspires to}} become a top twenty-five public {{research}} university with at least one-third of its PhD programs {{ranked in the top}} 15 nationally. The university owns more than 1,600 acres (6.4km²) and is the home of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory among other advanced research facilities. The university continues to develop in its capacity as a leader in Florida graduate research. Other milestones at the university include the first ETA10-G/8 supercomputer, capable of 10.8 GFLOPS in 1989, remarkable for the time in that it exceeded the existing speed record of the Cray-2/8, located at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory by a substantial leap and the development of the anti-cancer drug <b>Taxol.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many {{hundreds}} of medicines {{are derived from}} plants, both traditional medicines used in herbalism and chemical substances purified from plants or first identified in them, sometimes by ethnobotanical search, and then synthesised for use in modern medicine. Modern medicines derived from plants include aspirin, <b>taxol,</b> morphine, quinine, reserpine, colchicine, digitalis and vincristine. Plants used in herbalism include ginkgo, echinacea, feverfew, and Saint John's wort. The pharmacopoeia of Dioscorides, De Materia Medica, describing some 600 medicinal plants, was written between 50 and 70 AD and remained in use in Europe and the Middle East until around 1600 AD; it was the precursor of all modern pharmacopoeias.|$|E
5|$|RTI {{scientists}} Monroe Wall and Mansukh Wani synthesized anti-cancer treatments camptothecin in 1966, {{from the}} bark of the Camptotheca tree, and <b>Taxol</b> in 1971, from a Pacific yew tree. These two drugs account for $3 {{billion a year in}} sales by pharmaceutical companies. In 1986, RTI was awarded a $4 million contract with the National Cancer Institute to conduct an eight-year clinical trial on the effects of an anti-smoking campaign. Two years later, RTI began a $4.4 million program to coordinate AIDS drug trials for the National Institutes of Health. This had grown to $26 million by 1988.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} {{is classified as}} a Research University with Very High Research by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. The university comprises 16 separate colleges and more than 110 centers, facilities, labs and institutes that offer more than 360 programs of study, including professional school programs. The university has {{an annual budget of}} over $1.7 billion and an annual economic impact of over $10 billion. Florida State is home to Florida's only National Laboratory – the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and is the birthplace of the commercially viable anti-cancer drug <b>Taxol.</b> Florida State University also operates The John & Mable Ringling Museum of Art, the State Art Museum of Florida and one of the largest museum/university complexes in the nation.|$|E
5|$|Throughout history {{mandrake}}s (Mandragora officinarum) {{have been}} highly sought after for their reputed aphrodisiac properties. However, {{the roots of}} the mandrake plant also contain large quantities of the alkaloid scopolamine, which, at high doses, acts as a central nervous system depressant, and makes the plant highly toxic to herbivores. Scopolamine was later found to be medicinally used for pain management prior to and during labor; in smaller doses it is used to prevent motion sickness. One of the most well-known medicinally valuable terpenes is an anticancer drug, <b>taxol,</b> isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia, in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Larger drugs (>500 Da) can {{provoke a}} {{neutralizing}} immune response, {{particularly if the}} drugs are administered repeatedly, or in larger doses. This limits the effectiveness of drugs based on larger peptides and proteins (which are typically larger than 6000 Da). In some cases, the drug itself is not immunogenic, but may be co-administered with an immunogenic compound, as is sometimes the case for <b>Taxol.</b> Computational methods {{have been developed to}} predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins, which are particularly useful in designing therapeutic antibodies, assessing likely virulence of mutations in viral coat particles, and validation of proposed peptide-based drug treatments. Early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids; however, more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied virus proteins, as a training set. A publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by B cells. The emerging field of bioinformatics-based studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics. Immunoproteomics is the study of large sets of proteins (proteomics) involved in the immune response.|$|E
25|$|In November 1978, <b>taxol</b> {{was shown}} to be {{effective}} in xenograft studies.|$|E
25|$|The NCI {{continued}} to commission work to collect more Taxus bark and to isolate increasing quantities of <b>taxol.</b> By 1969, 28kg of crude extract had been isolated from almost 1,200kg of bark, although this ultimately yielded only 10 g of pure material, but for several years, no use {{was made of}} the compound by the NCI. In 1975, it was shown to be active in another in vitro system; two years later, a new department head reviewed the data and finally recommended <b>taxol</b> be moved on to the next stage in the discovery process. This required increasing quantities of purified <b>taxol,</b> up to 600 g, and in 1977 a further request for 7,000lbs of bark was made.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, two NCI {{researchers}} {{published a}} report showing <b>taxol</b> was mildly effective in leukaemic mice.|$|E
25|$|The cancer-fighting taxane {{class of}} drugs (paclitaxel (<b>taxol)</b> and docetaxel) block dynamic {{instability}} by stabilizing GDP-bound tubulin in the microtubule. Thus, even when hydrolysis of GTP reaches {{the tip of}} the microtubule, there is no depolymerization and the microtubule does not shrink back.|$|E
25|$|This {{synthetic}} route to <b>Taxol</b> {{is one of}} several; other groups have presented their own solutions, notably the group of Holton with a linear synthesis starting from borneol, the Samuel Danishefsky group starting from the Wieland-Miescher ketone and the Wender group from pinene.|$|E
25|$|Paclitaxel (<b>Taxol)</b> was a novel {{antimitotic agent}} that {{promoted}} microtubule assembly. This agent proved difficult to synthesize and {{could only be}} obtained from the bark of the Pacific Yew tree, which forced the NCI into the costly business of harvesting substantial quantities of yew trees from public lands. After 4 years of clinical testing in solid tumours, it was found in 1987 (23 years after its initial discovery) to be effective in ovarian cancer therapy. Notably, this agent, although developed by the NCI in partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb, was exclusively marketed by BMS (who had utilized the synthetic methodology developed by Robert Holton at Florida State University) who went on to make over a billion dollars profit from <b>Taxol.</b>|$|E
25|$|Paclitaxel (PTX), {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} <b>Taxol</b> among others, is a {{chemotherapy}} medication used to treat a number of types of cancer. This includes ovarian cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, Kaposi sarcoma, cervical cancer, and pancreatic cancer. It is given by injection into a vein. There is also an albumin bound formulation.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} in the {{synthesis}} of <b>Taxol,</b> the material was a racemic mixture. To obtain the desired enantiomer, allylic alcohol 4.9 was acylated with (1S)-(−)-camphanic chloride and dimethylaminopyridine, giving two diastereomers. These were then separated using standard column chromatography. The desired enantiomer was then isolated when one of the separated disatereomers was treated with potassium bicarbonate in methanol.|$|E
25|$|As {{shown in}} Scheme 7, Ojima lactam 7.1 reacted with alcohol 7.2 with sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide as a base. This alcohol is the triethylsilyl ether of the {{naturally}} occurring compound baccatin III. The related compound, 10-deacetylbaccatin III, {{is found in}} Taxus baccata, {{also known as the}} European Yew, in concentrations of 1 gram per kilogram leaves. Removal of the triethylsilyl protecting group gave <b>Taxol.</b>|$|E
25|$|Docetaxel {{is of the}} {{chemotherapy}} drug class; taxane, and is a semi-synthetic analogue of paclitaxel (<b>Taxol),</b> {{an extract}} from the bark of the rare Pacific yew tree Taxus brevifolia. Due to scarcity of paclitaxel, extensive research was carried out leading to the formulation of docetaxel – an esterified product of 10-deacetyl baccatin III, which is extracted from the renewable and more readily available leaves of the European yew tree.|$|E
25|$|As {{science and}} {{technology}} developed, medicine became more reliant upon medications. Throughout history and in Europe right until the late 18th century, not only animal and plant products were used as medicine, but also human body parts and fluids. Pharmacology developed in part from herbalism and some drugs are still derived from plants (atropine, ephedrine, warfarin, aspirin, digoxin, vinca alkaloids, <b>taxol,</b> hyoscine, etc.). Vaccines were discovered by Edward Jenner and Louis Pasteur.|$|E
25|$|As {{illustrated}} in Retrosynthetic Scheme I, <b>Taxol</b> {{was derived from}} diol 7.2 by an ester bond formation, according to the Ojima-Holton method. This diol comes from carbonate 6.3 {{by the addition of}} phenyllithium. The oxetane ring in compound 6.3 was obtained via an SN2 reaction involving a mesylate derived from acetate 4.9. Ring B was closed via a McMurry reaction involving dialdehyde 4.8 which ultimately was derived from aldehyde 4.2 and hydrazone 3.6 using a Shapiro coupling reaction.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on their}} reactivity, another {{distinct}} {{advantage of these}} two variants is that kinetically they provide a difference in diastereoselectivity. The reaction is very well established, and enantioselective variants (catalytic and stoichiometric) have also been achieved. From a retrosynthetic analysis standpoint, this reaction provides a reasonable alternative to conventional epoxidation reactions with alkenes (scheme 22). Danishefsky utilized this methodology for the synthesis of <b>taxol.</b> Diastereoselectivity is established by 1,3 interactions in the transition state required for epoxide closure.|$|E
25|$|The {{first public}} report from a phase II trial in May 1988 showed an effect in {{melanoma}} patients and a remarkable {{response rate of}} 30% in patients with refractory ovarian cancer. At this point, Gordon Cragg of the NCI's Natural Product Branch calculated the synthesis of enough <b>taxol</b> to treat all the ovarian cancer and melanoma cases in the US would require the destruction of 360,000 trees annually. For the first time, serious consideration {{was given to the}} problem of supply.|$|E
25|$|Paclitaxel total {{synthesis}} {{in organic}} chemistry {{is a major}} ongoing research effort in the total synthesis of paclitaxel (<b>Taxol).</b> This diterpenoid is an important drug {{in the treatment of}} cancer but, also expensive because the compound is harvested from a scarce resource, namely the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia). Not only is the synthetic reproduction of the compound itself of great commercial and scientific importance, but it also opens the way to paclitaxel derivatives not found in nature but with greater potential.|$|E
25|$|The acetyl {{group in}} 6.1 (Scheme 6) was removed to give primary alcohol 6.2. The <b>Taxol</b> ring (D) was added by an {{intramolecular}} nucleophilic substitution involving this hydroxyl group to give oxetane 6.3. After acetylation, phenyllithium {{was used to}} open the carbonate ester ring to give alcohol 6.5. Allylic oxidation with pyridinium chlorochromate, sodium acetate, and celite gave ketone 6.6, which was subsequently reduced using sodium borohydride to give secondary alcohol 6.7. This was the last compound before {{the addition of the}} amide tail.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, <b>taxol</b> was {{discovered}} {{as a natural}} product in a newly described endophytic fungus living in the yew tree. It has since been reported {{in a number of}} other endophytic fungi, including Nodulisporium sylviforme, Alternaria taxi, Cladosporium cladosporioides MD2, Metarhizium anisopliae, Aspergillus candidus MD3, Mucor rouxianus sp., Chaetomella raphigera, Phyllosticta tabernaemontanae, Phomopsis, Pestalotiopsis pauciseta, Phyllosticta citricarpa, Podocarpus, Fusarium solani, Pestalotiopsis terminaliae, Pestalotiopsis breviseta, Botryodiplodia theobromae Pat., Gliocladium sp., Alternaria alternata var. monosporus, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Nigrospora sp., Pestalotiopsis versicolor, and Taxomyces andreanae. However, there has been contradictory evidence for its production by endophytes, with other studies finding independent production is unlikely.|$|E
25|$|Phase I {{clinical}} trials began in April 1984, {{and the decision}} to start Phase II trials was made a year later. These larger trials needed more bark and collection of a further 12,000 pounds was commissioned, which enabled some phase II trials to begin {{by the end of}} 1986. But by then it was recognized that the demand for <b>taxol</b> might be substantial and that more than 60,000 pounds of bark might be needed as a minimum. This unprecedentedly large amount brought ecological concerns about the impact on yew populations into focus for the first time, as local politicians and foresters expressed unease at the program.|$|E

25|$|From 1967 to 1993, {{almost all}} {{paclitaxel}} produced {{was derived from}} bark from the Pacific yew, the harvesting of which kills the tree in the process. The processes used were descendants of the original isolation method of Monroe Wall and Mansukh Wani; by 1987, the NCI had contracted Hauser Chemical Research of Boulder, Colorado, to handle bark on the scale needed for Phase II and III trials. While both {{the size of the}} wild population of Taxus brevifola and the magnitude of the eventual demand for <b>taxol</b> were uncertain, it was clear for many years that an alternative, sustainable source of supply of the natural product would be needed. Initial attempts to broaden its sourcing used needles from the tree, or material from other related Taxus species, including cultivated ones, but these attempts were challenged by the relatively low and often highly variable yields obtained. Early in the 1990s, coincident with increased sensitivity to the ecology of the forests of the Pacific Northwest, paclitaxel was successfully extracted on a clinically useful scale from these sources.|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, BMS {{applied to}} {{trademark}} the name <b>taxol</b> as Taxol(R). This was controversially approved in 1992. At the same time, paclitaxel replaced <b>taxol</b> as the generic (INN) {{name of the}} compound. [...] Critics, including the journal Nature, argued the name <b>taxol</b> had been used {{for more than two}} decades and in more than 600 scientific articles and suggested the trademark should not have been awarded and that BMS should renounce its rights to it.

2500|$|Because of the {{practical}} and, in particular, the financial scale of the program needed, the NCI decided to seek association with a pharmaceutical company, and in August 1989, it published a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) offering its current stock and supply from current bark stocks, and proprietary access to the data so far collected, to a company willing to commit to providing the funds to collect further raw material, isolate <b>taxol,</b> and fund {{a large proportion of}} clinical trials.
