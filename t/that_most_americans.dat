25|$|As {{far back}} as 1969, the Bureau of Labor Statistics put forward {{suggested}} budgets for adequate family living. 60% of working-class Americans lived below one of these budgets, which suggested that a far higher proportion of Americans lived in poverty than the official poverty line suggested.

25|$|Although GM {{since the}} 1920s has always offered economy {{models in the}} U.S. market (relative to that market's {{definition}} in any given decade), and had done research and development in the 1940s and 1950s in preparation for any potential rise of strong demand for truly small cars in the U.S. market, {{it has also been}} criticized over the decades for not doing enough to promote fuel efficiency in the U.S. market in the 1970s through 1990s. GM's response has been that it has always responded to market demands, and <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans,</b> despite anything they said to the contrary, did not actually demand (at purchasing-decision time) small size or fuel efficiency in their vehicles to any great or lasting extent. Although some U.S. consumers flocked temporarily to the ideal of fuel economy whenever fuel supply crises arose (such as 1973 and 1979), they flocked equally enthusiastically to SUVs when cheap fuel of the 1980s and 1990s temporarily shielded them from any downside to these choices.|$|E
25|$|Factors such {{as nature}} {{of work and}} lack of {{influence}} within their jobs leads some theorists to the conclusion <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans</b> are working class. They have data that shows the majority of workers are not paid to share their ideas. These workers are closely supervised and do not enjoy independence in their jobs. Also, they are not paid to think. For example: The median annual earnings of salaried dentists were $136,960 in May 2006, indicating {{a high degree of}} scarcity for qualified personnel. The opinions and thoughts of dentists, much like those of other professionals, are sought after by their organizations and clients. The dentist creates a diagnosis, consults the patient, and conceptualizes a treatment. In 2009, Dental assistants made roughly $14.40 an hour, about $32,000 annually. Unlike dentists, dental assistants do not have much influence over the treatment of patients. They carry out routine procedures and follow the dentists' instructions. Here we see that a dental assistant being classified as working class. Similar relationships can be observed in other occupations.|$|E

The battle became more widely known after it was featured in the 1950s Disney miniseries Davy Crockett, which was largely based on myth. Within several years, John Wayne directed and starred in one of the best-known, but questionably accurate, film versions, 1960's The Alamo. In 2004 another film, also called The Alamo, was released. CNN described it as possibly [...] "the most character-driven of all the movies made on the subject". It is also considered more faithful to the actual events than other movies.|$|E

500|$|Sonic was {{originally}} teal-colored, then a light shade of blue, {{but he was}} changed to dark blue so he would stand out against certain backgrounds and to match the Sega logo. His shoes were colored red through the inspiration of Michael Jackson's boots on the album cover for Bad and the outfit of Santa Claus, whom Ohshima saw as the most [...] "famous character in the world". Sonic's spikes were emphasized {{to make him look}} sleeker, and he was given the ability to spin while jumping (so attacking and jumping could be controlled with one button). The new character {{was originally}} named [...] "Mr. Needlemouse", but the eight-member AM8 changed his name to [...] "Sonic" [...] and their studios to Sonic Team. Ideas proposed to flesh out the character included placing him in a rock band, giving him vampire fangs, and giving him a human girlfriend named Madonna, but Sega of America scrapped these ideas to keep his identity simple. Sega of America also expressed concerns <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans</b> would not know what a hedgehog is and initially proposed a full-scale recreation of the character, but compromised with Sonic Team to simply make design changes.

500|$|The film {{received}} a mixed critical response. In a review for Time magazine entitled [...] "Just Another Mississippi Whitewash", author Jack E.

He wrote, [...] "It is bad enough <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans</b> know next to nothing about {{the true story of}} the civil rights movement. It would be even worse for them to embrace the fabrications in Mississippi Burning." [...] Columnist Desson Howe of The Washington Post believed that the film [...] "speeds down the complicated, painful path of civil rights in search of a good thriller. Surprisingly, it finds it". He felt the film was a [...] "Hollywood-movie triumph that blacks could have used more of during – and since – that era." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader, lightly criticized Parker's direction, commenting that the film was [...] "sordid fantasy" [...] being [...] "trained on the murder of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964, and the feast for the self-righteous that emerges {{has little to do with}} history, sociology, or even common sense." [...] Rita Kempley of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "...like the South African saga Cry Freedom, it views the black struggle from an all-white perspective. And there's something of the demon itself in that. It's the right story, but with the wrong heroes." [...] Pauline Kael, writing for The New Yorker, praised the acting, but criticized the film's [...] "garish forms of violence" [...] and described it as [...] "morally repugnant".|$|E
500|$|Adams is {{generally}} {{less well known}} than many of America's other founding fathers. McCullough argued that [...] "he problem with Adams is <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans</b> know nothing about him." [...] Todd Leopold of CNN added in 2001 that Adams is [...] "remembered as that guy who served a single term as president between Washington and Jefferson, and as a short, vain, somewhat rotund man whose stature {{seems to have been}} dwarfed by his lanky colleagues." [...] He has always been seen, Ferling says, as [...] "honest and dedicated," [...] but despite his lengthy career in public service, is still overshadowed by the dramatic explanations and strong personalities of his contemporaries. Gilbert Chinard, in his 1933 biography of Adams, described the man as [...] "staunch, honest stubborn and somewhat narrow." [...] In his 1962 biography, Page Smith lauds Adams for his fight against radicals such as Thomas Paine, whose promised reforms portended anarchy and misery. In 1995, Peter Shaw published The Character of John Adams. Ferling says that the man who emerges is one [...] "perpetually at war with himself," [...] whose desire for fame and recognition leads to changes of vanity. Ferling, in his 1992 biography, writes that [...] "Adams was his own worst enemy." [...] He criticizes Adams for his [...] "pettiness...jealousy, and vanity," [...] and finds fault with him for his frequent separations from his wife and children. However, he praises Adams for his willingness to acknowledge his deficiencies and for striving to overcome them. In 2001, David McCullough published a biography of the president entitled John Adams. McCullough lauds Adams for consistency and honesty, [...] "plays down or explains away" [...] his more controversial actions, such as the dispute over presidential titles and the predawn flight from the White House, and criticizes his friend and rival, Jefferson. The book was very favorably received and, along with other biographies published not long before, contributed to a rapid surge in Adams' reputation.|$|E
