It was first heard by a live audience in December 1982 in Glasgow, Scotland, on a twenty-one show [...] "Pre-War Tour." [...] The band were particularly nervous about playing {{the song in}} Belfast, Northern Ireland. Introducing the song there at the Maysfield Leisure Centre, Bono stated [...] "It's not a rebel song.", attempted to further clarify this point by reciting the entire second verse ("Broken bottles under children's feet ..."), and added as a final note, [...] "If you don't like it, you let us know." [...] The crowd overwhelmingly enjoyed the song; the Edge recalls that [...] "the place went nuts, it drew a really positive reaction.", also saying that [...] "We <b>thought</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> the song before we played it in Belfast and Bono told the audience that if they didn't like it then we'd never play it again.

For comedy completists and comedians alike, this book is a real treat." [...] The Washington Post said of Nesteroff, [...] "He writes with insider perception but never seems to be either whitewashing or trashing any of this outrageous cast. Like a biblical epic, The Comedians seems to have a cast of thousands. One act barely somersaults offstage before Nesteroff leads on the next. The anecdotes are memorable and often hilarious ... With his encyclopedic knowledge, talent for vivid anecdotes and tireless gusto, he drives this busload of rowdy clowns into the 21st century." [...] The Onion's AV Club stated, [...] "Nesteroff is intent on giving the beautiful losers of comedy their due. The Comedians is an astonishingly assured and compulsively readable exploration of an impossibly vast topic." [...] The New York Times book review said, [...] "The way he traces ... the evolution of comedy is fascinating ... Through his elegiac attention, these forgotten comedians become almost romantic figures, the stars of a secret history of laughter." ...|$|R

[...] They also used public street meetings to try and attract as many black working-class youth as possible to their organization, particularly gang members.

And rather than going with the {{traditional}} Uma Thurman role, we <b>thought</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> Kill Bill and who her character was in that, and this kind of resilience and this violence, but there's something that's authentic about it (like a woman taking revenge or being empowered).
