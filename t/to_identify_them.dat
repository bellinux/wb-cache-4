5|$|After {{the start}} of the {{conflict}} between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, there was a mass migration of Tamils trying to escape the hardships and perils of war. Initially, it was middle class professionals, such as doctors and engineers, who emigrated; they were followed by the poorer segments of the community. The fighting drove more than 800,000 Tamils from their homes to other places within Sri Lanka as internally displaced persons and also overseas, prompting the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>them</b> in 2004 as the largest asylum-seeking group.|$|E
5|$|As of 2003 {{there were}} still 138 Allied men with no known grave in the area, and they are commemorated at the Groesbeek Memorial. However, {{evidence}} of the battle is often discovered even today, and the bodies of Allied servicemen are reinterred at the Airborne Cemetery. When found, bodies are exhumed and Dutch Graves Registration staff attempt <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>them</b> before they are reburied. One soldier of the Border Regiment was discovered and reburied in the cemetery in 2005 and another who had previously been unidentified was reburied in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Krause {{and colleagues}} wrote {{that these two}} teeth {{resemble}} multituberculate deciduous anterior upper premolars, particularly second and third premolars (P2 and P3), and used this {{as one of their}} arguments for identifying Ferugliotherium as a multituberculate. However, as with the dentary MACN Pv-RN 975, the two upper premolars were excluded from Ferugliotherium and identified as multituberculates by Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues after the discovery of the jaw of Sudamerica. Gurovich continues <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>them</b> as Ferugliotherium {{on the basis of their}} size and provenance and other similarities between Ferugliotherium and multituberculates.|$|E

5|$|Laura and L. D. {{were due}} to be arraigned on May 25. Between 11:30 and midnight on May 24, a group of between a dozen and 40 men arrived at the jail. They entered it {{through the front door}} of the sheriff's office. Payne, the jailer, said he had left it {{unlocked}} to let in a detective from McAlester, who was looking for an escaped prisoner. He said the men bound, gagged and blindfolded him at gunpoint, took his keys, and cut the telephone line. He was unable <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{probable}} {{prokaryotic cell}} fossils date to almost 3.5billion years ago, most prokaryotes {{do not have}} distinctive morphologies and fossil shapes cannot be used <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>them</b> as archaea. Instead, chemical fossils of unique lipids are more informative because such compounds do not occur in other organisms. Some publications suggest that archaeal or eukaryotic lipid remains are present in shales dating from 2.7billion years ago; such data have since been questioned. Such lipids have also been detected in even older rocks from west Greenland. The oldest such traces come from the Isua district, which include Earth's oldest known sediments, formed 3.8billion years ago. The archaeal lineage {{may be the most}} ancient that exists on Earth.|$|E
5|$|As a {{relatively}} rural environment {{in an increasingly}} urbanised area, Kersal Moor was also used for more peaceful pursuits. During the 18th and 19th centuries it was much frequented by amateur naturalists and botanists. One of the botanists was Richard Buxton {{who went on to}} write A Botanical Guide to Manchester. In 1829 an amateur insect collector named Robert Cribb collected a series of about fifty small yellow and brown moths from a rotting alder on the moor. These {{turned out to be a}} previously unknown species of moth, but they were mistakenly attributed to a friend of Cribb's, the collector R. Wood, who had asked an expert <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>them.</b> The moths were classified as Pancalia woodiella (today Euclemensia woodiella) in Wood's honour.|$|E

5|$|At present, some 192 spells are known, {{though no}} single {{manuscript}} contains them all. They served {{a range of}} purposes. Some are intended to give the deceased mystical knowledge in the afterlife, or perhaps <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>them</b> with the gods: for instance, Spell 17 is an obscure and lengthy description of the god Atum. Others are incantations to ensure the different elements of the dead person's being were preserved and reunited, and to give the deceased control over the world around him. Still others protect the deceased from various hostile forces or guide him through the underworld past various obstacles. Famously, two spells also deal with the judgement of the deceased in the Weighing of the Heart ritual.|$|E
5|$|Brunel and Gooch both {{gave their}} {{locomotives}} names <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>them,</b> but the standard-gauge companies {{that became a}} part of the GWR used numbers. Until 1864 the GWR therefore had named broad-gauge locomotives and numbered standard-gauge ones. From the time of Armstrong's arrival all new locomotives– both broad and standard– were given numbers, including broad-gauge ones that had previously carried names when they were acquired from other railways. Dean introduced a policy in 1895 of giving passenger tender locomotives both numbers and names. Each batch was given names with a distinctive theme, for example kings for the 6000 class and castles for the 4073 class.|$|E
5|$|When Blake {{finds the}} bodies, he calls Nelson, who comes out <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>them.</b> After Blake angrily demands an explanation, Nelson reluctantly reveals West's condition. Nelson {{believes}} West is somehow getting stronger the more his body decomposes. Back at Nelson's house, West attacks and kills Perry, although Judy is not harmed. Nelson and Blake arrive just as West escapes. West then stumbles upon {{the home of}} a married couple (played by Jonathan Demme and Janus Blythe). West kills the man and attacks his wife, but she drives him away after chopping his arm off with a cleaver. Blake receives a call about the attack and takes Nelson with him to investigate. They follow West to a giant power plant, and then up several flights of outside stairways.|$|E

5|$|The Do 217s trailed {{the fleet}} for some time, but the Italian fleet did not open fire upon {{sighting}} them; they were trailing the fleet {{at such a}} distance {{that it was impossible}} <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>them</b> as Allied or Axis, and Bergamini believed that they were the air cover promised to them by the Allies. However, an attack upon Italia and Roma at 15:37 spurred the fleet into action, as the anti-aircraft batteries onboard opened fire and all ships began evasive maneuvers. About fifteen minutes after this, Italia was hit on the starboard side underneath her fore main turrets, while Roma was hit on the same side somewhere between frames 100 and 108. This bomb passed through the ship and exploded beneath the keel, damaging the hull girder and allowing water to flood the after engine room and two boiler rooms. The flooding caused the inboard propellers to stop for want of power and started a large amount of arcing, which itself caused many electrical fires in the aft half of the ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{violence}} and terror of Pontiac's War convinced many western Pennsylvanians that their {{government was not}} doing enough to protect them. This discontent was manifested most seriously in an uprising led by a vigilante group that {{came to be known as}} the Paxton Boys, so-called because they were primarily from the area around the Pennsylvania village of Paxton (or Paxtang). The Paxtonians turned their anger towards Native Americans—many of them Christians—who lived peacefully in small enclaves in the midst of white Pennsylvania settlements. Prompted by rumors that a Native war party had been seen at the Native village of Conestoga, on December 14, 1763, a group of more than 50 Paxton Boys marched on the village and murdered the six Susquehannocks they found there. Pennsylvania officials placed the remaining 16 Susquehannocks in protective custody in Lancaster, but on December 27 the Paxton Boys broke into the jail and slaughtered most of them. Governor John Penn issued bounties for the arrest of the murderers, but no one came forward <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 1973, {{a wave of}} UFO {{sightings}} {{in southeast}} Missouri prompted Harley D.

Although taking a specific interest in describing unidentified aerial phenomena, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>identifying</b> <b>them,</b> the book references the presumed intelligence of the sighted objects. Rutledge's study results were not published in any peer-reviewed journal or other scientific venue or format.|$|R
