Kyle Anderson from EW wrote [...] "We should probably just {{change the name of}} <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>from</b> '2013' to '1978', because there are more sparkly suits and disco guitars than we know what to do with" [...] and that [...] "Bruno Mars has gone full-on Betamax for his new video for the track 'Treasure'. It's all there: the suits, the setting, and the bong-water video effects". Jordan Sargent of Spin said that Mars wasn't trying to hide the Michael Jackson influence on the video, writing [...] "new low-def makes obvious — compare it next to, say, the video for [...] "Rock with You"". Similarly, Robbie Daw, from the Idolator website, drew {{attention to the fact that}} the song and dance had already been seen during the performance on Billboard Music Awards in May, since [...] "Mars and his band seem to have recreated that very same performance for this clip". He also wrote that the video was [...] "still a fun three minutes to sit through", mainly because [...] "Bruno mimics MJ's [...] "Rock With You" [...] moves so deftly". According to Joseph Atilano of the Philippine Daily Inquirer, [...] "everything from the choreography, stage lighting, and so on, serve as a heartfelt ode to that era". He wrote [...] "visually, the music video is tricked out with set pieces such as a disco ball and vintage stage lights. Even the manner by which the instruments were set up in the background show the attention given to even the minutest of details and the small things do matter when it comes to making a music video".|$|E

Everybody of any note was there <b>this</b> <b>year.</b> <b>From</b> their own part of England came many that they knew; among the rest, Lord and Lady Purbeck, the Earl and Countess of Wessex, Sir John Grebe, the Drenkhards, Lady Stourvale, the old Duke of Hamptonshire, the Bishop of Melchester, the Dean of Exonbury, and other lesser lights of Court, pulpit, and field. Thither also came the fair Contessa, whom, as soon as Philippa saw how much she was sought after by younger men, she could not conscientiously suspect of renewed designs upon Sir Ashley.|$|E
60|$|The legates, having thus triumphed {{over the}} king, passed back into France, but without {{relaxing}} the interdict or excommunication, which they still left hanging over him, lest {{he should be}} tempted to throw off the chains of his new subjection. Arriving in France, they delivered their orders to Philip with as much haughtiness as they had done to John. They {{told him that the}} end of the war was answered in the humiliation of the King of England, who had been rendered a dutiful son of the Church,--and that, if the King of France should, after this notice, proceed to further hostilities, he had to apprehend the same sentence which had humbled his adversary. Philip, who had not raised so great an army with a view of reforming the manners of King John, would have slighted these threats, had he not found that they were seconded by the ill dispositions of a part of his own army. The Earl of Flanders, always disaffected to his cause, was glad of this opportunity to oppose him, and, only following him through fear, withdrew his forces, and now openly opposed him. Philip turned his arms against his revolted vassal. The cause of John was revived by this dissension, and his courage seemed rekindled. Making one effort of a vigorous mind, he brought his fleet to an action with the French navy, which he entirely destroyed on the coast of Flanders, and thus freed himself from the terror of an invasion. But when he intended to embark and improve his success, the barons refused to follow him. They alleged that he was still excommunicated, and that they would not follow a lord under the censures of the Church. This demonstrated to the king the necessity of a speedy absolution; and he received it <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>from</b> the hands of Cardinal Langton.|$|E
