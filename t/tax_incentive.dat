Additional legislation stalled after negotiations over how to make the state's retirement system solvent reached an impasse. Fletcher indicated that he would consider calling the Assembly into special session later in the year. In July, Fletcher called the session and included 67 items on its agenda. Democrats in the state House of Representatives maintained that none of the items were urgent enough to warrant a special session. They claimed the call was an attempt by Fletcher to boost his sagging poll numbers against Beshear, and the House adjourned after only 90 minutes without acting on any of Fletcher's agenda. Fletcher denied the claims and insisted that a <b>tax</b> <b>incentive</b> program was needed immediately to keep the state in the running for a proposed coal gasification plant to be built by Peabody Energy. After negotiating with legislators, Fletcher called another session for August; the session included only the <b>tax</b> <b>incentive</b> program, which the Assembly passed.|$|E

40|$|As {{a policy}} tool, state <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> can be {{structured}} to help states meet clean energy goals. Policymakers often use state <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> {{in concert with}} state and federal policies to support renewable energy deployment or reduce market barriers. This analysis used case studies of four states to assess the contributions of state <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> {{to the development of}} renewable energy markets. State <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> that are appropriately paired with complementary state and federal policies generally provide viable mechanisms to support renewable energy deployment. However, challenges to successful implementation of state <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> include serving project owners with limited state tax liability, assessing appropriate incentive levels, and differentiating levels of incentives for technologies with different costs. Additionally, state <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> may result in moderately higher federal tax burdens. These challenges notwithstanding, state <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> that consider certain policy design characteristics can support renewable energy markets and state clean energy goals.

40|$|Governments {{around the}} world have {{implemented}} several tax policies to strengthen the competitiveness and investment capacities of the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) specifically, those in the manufacturing sector. In Malaysia, the importance of SMEs in industrialization and economy has led the government to extend <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> to eligible SMEs. Successful utilization of <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> will enable SMEs to reduce {{the cost of doing business}} through deductible tax exemptions. Unfortunately, not many SMEs have been successful in utilizing the granted <b>tax</b> <b>incentives.</b> Hence, the goal of this study is to investigate the performance of Malaysia’s SMEs in manufacturing sector which have been granted <b>tax</b> <b>incentives.</b> Specifically, this study identifies the factors leading to the successful utilization of <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> from the SMEs owners’/managers’ perspectives, analyses the financial characteristics differences between successful and unsuccessful SMEs’ utilization of <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> and determines the relationship between the financial characteristics, age of the company and <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> on SMEs performance. Two methodological approaches for data collection were employed; questionnaire survey and financial statements analysis. For the survey, factor analysis was applied to analyze the key factors leading to successful utilization of <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> and the analysis was further extended using Logistic Regression. Discriminant analysis was used to differentiate the financial characteristics between successful and unsuccessful SMEs where the tax exempt income account reported in the financial statements stands as proxy in differentiating both categories of SMEs. On the other hand, Multiple Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between the financial characteristics, age of the company and tax exempt income account on SMEs performance. Three models were developed to test the three groups of samples; small-sized companies, medium-sized companies and pooled sample of both types of companies. The findings showed that the <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> given based on profit is a weak policy tool in stimulating SMEs’ investment, thus limiting them from gaining competitive advantage locally or abroad. Most SMEs have been unsuccessful in utilizing the <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> because they are not generating profit consistently. The period at which SMEs are awarded with <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> is unsuitable since most of them are making losses in the initial stage of operation. Hence, the <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> do not improve their financial position. Lack of monitoring from the relevant awarding authority such as MIDA contributes to the ineffectiveness of <b>tax</b> <b>incentives.</b> The performance of SMEs with <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> should be monitored and-evaluated continuously to ensure the objectives of providing <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> are achieved. In this study, the term foreign SMEs refers to companies which are registered by foreigners in Malaysia and the purpose of including them is solely to distinguish them from the local Malaysian-owned SMEs. The findings of this study send an important signal to the relevant government agencies and the policy makers to formulate appropriate policy on <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> for small-sized and medium-sized companies. Treating both types of companies as single entity in granting <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> will distort the equitable principles of the present tax system. Thus, it is worthwhile to apply the macro aspect of the Tax Competition Theory in extending <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> to SMEs. Finally, there should be some vital policy reforms which take into consideration the size of the companies since, this study proved that size has significant effect in differentiating between successful and unsuccessful small-sized and medium-sized companie...|$|R

Simulated <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> involved increasing capital cost allowance and investment tax credit and reducing corporate income tax. The production technology was specified as a function of capital, labor, energy, sawlogs, and a time dependent technological progress variable. A translog multilateral index number model was applied to measure and analyze TFP. Two analytical phases were followed. In the first phase, without the <b>tax</b> <b>incentives,</b> we analyzed annual levels and growth rates of TFP 1; and parametrically examined effects of output growth and time dependent technology on the growth of TFP 1. Over the study period, the average annual growth rate of TFP 1 was 2 %; and the parametric results revealed that the marginal effects of each of output growth and technological progress on TFP 1 growth were highly significant. The second phase involved recalculation of the rental price of capital to estimate effects of the simulated <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> on capital formation and growth of TFP (=Â TFP 2). As expected, the average annual share of capital in total cost with the <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> rose to 12 % from 9 % without the <b>tax</b> <b>incentives.</b> The average annual capital intensity also rose to real $ 15, 263. 70 with the incentives from real $ 10, 402. 91 without the incentives. Most importantly, higher capital formation, motivated by the <b>tax</b> <b>incentives,</b> raised aggregate quantity of the inputs significantly, leading to a slightly lower TFP 2 than TFP 1, because output was unchanged. In short, the data validated the hypothesis that <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> do indeed spur capital formation and TFP growth. <b>Tax</b> <b>incentives</b> Capital intensity Technological progress Technical efficiency Competitiveness...|$|R
