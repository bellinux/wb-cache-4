5|$|Another American <b>tradition</b> <b>is</b> {{that of an}} apolitical military, {{although}} this custom was of more recent origin, dating back only to the period after the American Civil War. Few officers voted in the 19th century, {{but not so much}} from a lack of interest in politics as because frequently moving from state to state and living on Federal land effectively disenfranchised them under the laws of many states. Under General of the Army William T. Sherman, the Commanding General of the United States Army from 1869 to 1883, who hated politics, this custom of an apolitical military became firmly established.|$|E

50|$|Franco's Spanish {{nationalism}} {{promoted a}} unitary national identity by repressing Spain's cultural diversity. Bullfighting and flamenco were promoted as national traditions, while those traditions not considered Spanish were suppressed.

All cultural activities were subject to censorship, and many were forbidden entirely, often in an erratic manner. This cultural policy relaxed over time, most notably in the late 1960s and early 1970s.|$|R

5|$|Roark's modernist {{approach}} to architecture is contrasted {{with that of}} most of the other architects in the novel. In the opening chapter, the dean of his architecture school tells Roark that the best architecture must copy the past rather than innovate or improve. Roark repeatedly loses jobs with architectural firms and commissions from clients because he is unwilling to copy conventional architectural styles. In contrast, Keating's mimicry of convention brings him top honors in school and an immediate job offer. The same conflict between innovation and <b>tradition</b> <b>is</b> reflected in the career of Roark's mentor, Henry Cameron.|$|E
5|$|Stargazy pie is a pastry-based fish pie which, by <b>tradition,</b> <b>is</b> {{filled with}} whole pilchards. Critically, the pilchards must retain their heads, which then poke through the pastry top, {{appearing}} {{to gaze at}} the stars. The position of the fish allows the oil that is released during cooking to drain into the pie, adding a fuller flavour and ensuring the pie is moist. The celebrity chef Rick Stein suggested also poking the pilchards' tails through the pie crust to give the effect of leaping through water.|$|E
