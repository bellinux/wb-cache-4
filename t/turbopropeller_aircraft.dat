50|$|Increasing {{knowledge}} of the surrounding landscape led to permanent agricultural settlement very soon afterwards, mostly grazing beef and dairy cattle. It was, until {{the opening of the}} all-weather port of Grassy Harbour in 1974, the main port connecting the island with both Victoria and Tasmania. It is a significant centre for the fishing industry, especially rock lobster. There is also a nearby airport, King Island Airport, capable of handling medium-sized <b>turbopropeller</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E
50|$|Due to its short {{runway and}} limited ramp space, the only {{aircraft}} that {{can use the}} airport are <b>turbopropeller</b> <b>aircraft</b> such as the Fokker 50, ATR 72, and Dash 8. The main problem of La Nubia airport is weather. Sometimes shut down due to fog, rain, or winds, {{it is difficult for}} airlines to offer a reliable schedule for the passengers wishing to visit Manizales and Caldas. Combined with its daylight-only hours of operation and limited runway length, La Nubia has been seen as an obstacle to the region's development.|$|E
40|$|Since 2011 the {{aerodynamic}} {{research group}} of the Dept. of Industrial Engineering of the University of Naples "Federico II" makes use of the University's computing grid infrastructure SCoPE to perform parallel computing simulations with the commercial CAE package Star-CCM+. This infrastructure allows Navier-Stokes calculations on complete aircraft configurations in a relative short amount of time. Therefore, the software and the above mentioned infrastructure allow the parametric analysis of several configurations that are extremely useful to the correct estimation of aerodynamic interference among aircraft components and to highlight some useful trends that could indicate how a specific aerodynamic characteristic (i. e. the drag of a component, the wing downwash or the directional stability contribution of the vertical tail) is linked to aircraft geometrical parameters. Thus, with {{the choice of a}} specific set of test-cases it is possible to make a deep investigation on some aerodynamic features and, from the analyses of results, it is possible to extract and develop ad-hoc semi-empirical methodologies {{that could be used in}} preliminary design activities. In this paper, two investigations are presented: the aerodynamic interference among aircraft components in sideslip and the aerodynamic characteristics of a fuselage, focusing on typical large <b>turbopropeller</b> <b>aircraft</b> category...|$|E
40|$|One {{proposed}} {{solution to the}} total short-haul transportation system problem is to use existing low-wing-loading <b>turbopropeller</b> STOL <b>aircraft.</b> Deflected slipstream turboprop aircraft have also been considered for early STOL service. Aspects of current aircraft research are discussed together with the NASA research aircraft, field length and aircraft performance considerations, crosswind landings, crosswind reducing fences, elevated STOL ports, a guaranteed friction STOL runway, and problems of runway containment...|$|R
