5|$|A pop ballad, {{the song}} {{includes}} instrumentation from guitars, keyboards, drums and a synthesizer, and its lyrics deal with deceit, mistrust and childhood scars. It {{is also about}} being strong, which Madonna recalled {{in an interview that}} she <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> relationship with her parents, while writing the lyrics. The music video, directed by James Foley, shows Madonna's first image makeover, featuring her with a cleaner look, shoulder-length wavy golden blond hair, conservative wardrobe and subtle make-up. This toned down blond appearance was again inspired by Marilyn Monroe.|$|E
5|$|My first {{memory of}} {{fragrance}} is my mother, {{and as a}} very young girl, hearing her footsteps... Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she would walk past me and it would just stay in the room. It left a warm feeling every time I <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> scent. I think about the icons that I respect {{and they all have}} their own fragrance so I thought {{it was time for me}} to have my own.|$|E
25|$|Polly's bubble in Paris burst {{when she}} learned shortly after their arrival that Harry had been flirting with a girl from Boston. It {{was the first of}} many flirtations and affairs that Polly would learn to live with. In early 1923, Polly {{introduced}} Harry to her friend Constance Coolidge. She was the niece of Frank Crowninshield, editor of Vanity Fair, and had been married to American diplomat Ray Atherton. Constance didn't care what others <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>her.</b> She loved anything risky and was addicted to gambling. She and Harry soon began a sexual relationship.|$|E

25|$|Mortimer and Isabella {{landed in}} England {{two months later}} in September 1326, and they joined forces with Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster. On 16 November, King Edward was taken {{prisoner}} and eventually murdered at Berkeley Castle, presumably by Mortimer's hired assassins. From 1327 to 1330, Mortimer and Isabella jointly held the Office of Regent for her son, King Edward III who was duly crowned following his father's death. Mortimer was made constable of Wallingford Castle; in September 1328, Mortimer was created Earl of March. This made Joan henceforth, the Countess of March; {{although it is not}} known what she <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> husband's illegal assumption of power and flagrant affair with the Queen. What has been established is that Joan was never an active participant in her husband's insurrection against King Edward.|$|E
500|$|The casting of {{the lead}} pair was leaked well before the {{intended}} official announcements. Gowariker cast Harman Baweja after watching the trailer of his debut film, the science fiction romance Love Story 2050 (2008). He asked Harman's father, Harry Baweja, to show him the film's rushes and was impressed with his performance, calling him the best person for the part. Following this, Priyanka Chopra, {{who had worked with}} Baweja in Love Story 2050, was cast to play all twelve of the potential brides, each related to one of the twelve zodiac signs. On casting Chopra, Gowariker said: [...] "I have always liked Priyanka's work, right from [...] She's been fabulous in all her films. So when I thought of somebody doing twelve roles I <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>her,</b> as I thought she had the potential." [...] When Gowariker offered the film to her, Chopra instantly agreed to star in it.|$|E
500|$|The war had a {{significant}} influence on Moore's life - he said his only romance ended when his fiancée Lorna, a nurse, was killed in London in 1943 by a bomb which struck her ambulance. Moore subsequently remarked that he never married because [...] "there {{was no one else}} for me... second best is no good for me... I would have liked a wife and family, but it was not to be." [...] In his autobiography he said that after sixty years he still <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>her,</b> and because of her death [...] "if I saw the entire German nation sinking into the sea, I could be relied upon to help push it down." [...] In May 2012 he said to the Radio Times magazine, [...] "We must take care. There may be another war. The Germans will try again, given another chance". He also said, in the same interview, that [...] "The only good Kraut is a dead Kraut." [...] However, some doubt has arisen over Moore's account, as researchers have been unable to identify Lorna, despite the meticulous records kept of wartime civilian casualties.|$|E

50|$|The song {{itself is}} a ballad, which builds in {{intensity}} towards the end. The singer describes <b>her</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> lover, and asks why she is the lucky one to have his love, as against anyone else.|$|R
50|$|In addition, it {{can lead}} to sexual dysfunction. Engaging in sexual {{activity}} involves another person focusing attention on one's body and during sexual relations a woman can be distracted by <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> body rather than experiencing sexual pleasure.|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rick Edwards titled Under the Skin of Leona Lewis on 28 February 2010 for 4Music, Lewis revealed {{that she is a}} fan of Oasis and that [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" [...] is a [...] "great song" [...] with a [...] "beautiful sentiment behind it". She continued to say herself and label boss Simon Cowell discussed the possibility of Lewis recording a discussed cover version. Lewis cited her reason for wishing to record her own version as being a [...] "massive" [...] fan of rock bands, and that she wanted to put a [...] "different spin on it". When asked the question of if she knew what Gallagher <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> version, she replied saying that she had not spoken to them and that she did not know if they had listened to her version. Originally written solely by Gallagher, Lewis's cover version was produced by Steve Robson. Both Robson and Lewis were the vocal producers on [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out". It was engineered by Richard Flack, who was assisted in the process by vocal engineer Seth Waldmann. It was mixed by Jeremy Wheatly at Twenty-One Studios, located in London, England. A range of instrumentalists were bought in for the song; Karl Brazil played the drums, while Luke Potashnick provided guitar. John Garrison played the bass and Robson the piano.

2500|$|Because {{he missed}} his fiancée, Bella, who was still in Vitebsk—"He <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> day and night", writes Baal-Teshuva—and was afraid of losing her, Chagall decided to accept an {{invitation}} from a noted art dealer in Berlin to exhibit his work, his intention being to continue on to Belarus, marry Bella, and then return with her to Paris. Chagall took 40 canvases and 160 gouaches, watercolors and drawings to be exhibited. The exhibit, held at Herwarth Walden's Sturm Gallery was a huge success, [...] "The German critics positively sang his praises." ...|$|E
2500|$|In The Cry of Tamar: Violence Against Women and the Church's Response, Pamela Cooper-White {{criticizes the}} Bible's {{depiction}} of Tamar for {{its emphasis on}} the male roles in the story and the perceived lack of sympathy given to Tamar. [...] "The narrator of 2 Samuel 13 at times portrays poignantly, eliciting our sympathy for the female victim. But mostly, the narrator (I assume he) steers us {{in the direction of}} primary interest, even sympathy, for the men all around her. Even the poignancy of Tamar's humiliation is drawn out for the primary purpose of justifying Absalom's later murder of Amnon and not for its own sake." [...] She opined that [...] "Sympathy for Tamar is not the narrator's primary interest. The forcefulness of Tamar's impression is drawn out, not to illuminate her pain, but to justify Absalom's anger at Amnon and subsequent murder of him." [...] Cooper-White also states that after the incestuous rape, the narrative continues to focus on Amnon, writing, [...] "The story continues to report the perpetrator's viewpoint, the thoughts and feelings after the incident of violence; the victim's viewpoint is not presented. [...] We are given no indication that he ever <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> again—even in terms of fear of punishment or reprisal." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1923, {{shortly after}} their arrival in Paris, Caresse {{introduced}} Crosby {{to her friend}} Constance Coolidge, also a Boston Brahmin, an American expatriate. She was the niece of Frank Crowninshield, editor of Vanity Fair, and had been married to American diplomat Ray Atherton. Constance didn't care what others <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>her.</b> She loved anything risky and was addicted to gambling. Crosby nicknamed her the [...] "Lady of the Golden Horse." [...] Crosby immediately began {{a sexual relationship with}} her that continued for several months. Harry rationalized their affair, telling Constance, [...] "One should follow every instinct no matter where it leads." [...] In the fall of 1923, Caresse could not put up with their affair any longer and left for London. Harry told Constance the Caresse he could not meet Caresses' [...] demand that he [...] "love her more than anyone in the world. This is absolutely impossible." [...] But Crosby would not leave Caresse, nor did Constance ask this of him. But when Constance received a letter from Caresse who confessed that her affair with her husband had made her [...] "very miserable", Constance wrote Harry and told him she would not see him any more. Harry was devastated by her decision. [...] "Your letter was bar none the worst blow I have ever received. [...] I wouldn't leave her under any circumstances nor as you say would you ever marry me." [...] But the three remained friends, and on October 1, 1924 Constance married the Count Pierre de Jumilhac, although the marriage only lasted 5 years.|$|E
2500|$|On 3April 1937, Puyi's younger {{full brother}} Prince Pujie was proclaimed heir {{apparent}} after marrying Lady Hiro Saga, a distant cousin to the Japanese Emperor Hirohito. The marriage had been politically arranged by Shigeru Honjō, a {{general of the}} Kwantung Army. Puyi thereafter would not speak candidly {{in front of his}} brother and refused to eat any food provided by Lady Hiro Saga, believing that she was out to poison him. Puyi was forced to sign an agreement that if he himself had a male heir, the child would be sent to Japan to be raised by the Japanese. Puyi initially thought that Lady Saga was a Japanese spy, but came to trust her after the Sinophile Saga discarded her kimono dresses for cheongsam dresses and she repeatedly assured him that she come to the Salt Tax Palace because she was Pujie's wife, not because she was a spy. Behr described Lady Saga as [...] "intelligent" [...] and [...] "level-headed", and noted the irony of Puyi snubbing the one Japanese who really wanted to be his friend. A sign of improved relations came when Puyi gave Lady Saga a diamond encrusted watch as a belated wedding present. Later in April1937, a [...] 16year-old Manchu aristocrat Tan Yuling moved into the Salt Tax Palace to become Puyi's concubine, but though Puyi seemed to have liked her, it remains unclear whether he had sex with her or not. Lady Saga tried to improve relations between Puyi and Wanrong by having them eat dinner together, which {{was the first time that}} they had shared a meal in three years. Wanrong refused to eat with chopsticks, instead using her fingers, which is regarded as [...] "savage" [...] behavior in Asia, but Wanrong stated she was past the point of caring about what others <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>her.</b> Puyi tried to joke away Wanrong's unhappiness by saying that tonight was [...] "Mongol night", and everyone was going to be like a Mongol [...] "savage" [...] by eating with their fingers, but Lady Saga noted his jesting failed.|$|E
