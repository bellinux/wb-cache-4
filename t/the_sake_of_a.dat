5|$|The {{film was}} advertised to the American churchgoer {{as a moral}} picture. The film was {{generally}} well received by critics, but the faults of story for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> moral lesson was noted. Adrift, like all other American silents of the day, had no musical accompaniment, but a letter written into a trade publication provides a score for the drama. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{positively}} reviewed by critics, but {{contained within the}} reviews were often criticism on {{the execution of the}} story and plot. A review in the The Moving Picture World was positive to the moral lesson the film asserted and found the acting to be satisfactory. Walton of the The Moving Picture News criticized the type of film as invoking sudden and unnatural changes in character for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> moral lesson. The child's influence and ability to bring sense to her father was seen as cheap theatrics, but ended with the assertion that the film was not second rate for employing such theatrics. The New York Dramatic Mirror was positive, but said that the scene upon which the little girl follows her father was not believable because she was unaware of her father's intentions to kill himself. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
25|$|Among {{black men}} in America, coolness, which may have its roots in slavery as an ironic {{submission}} and concealed subversion, at times is enacted {{in order to create}} a powerful appearance, a type of performance frequently maintained for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> social audience.|$|E

25|$|The war {{dragged on}} for several years longer {{in a series of}} {{desultory}} sallies and frontier massacres: neither the leaders in England nor France thought of weakening their position in Europe for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> knock-out blow in North America. By the terms of the Treaty of Ryswick the boundaries and outposts of New France, New England, and New York remained substantially unchanged. In Newfoundland and Hudson's Bay French influence now predominated but William III, who had made the interests of the Bay Company a cause of war in North America, was not prepared to hazard his European policy for the sake of their pursuit. The Iroquois Five Nations, abandoned by their English allies, were obliged to open separate negotiations, and by the treaty of 1701 they agreed to remain neutral in any future Anglo-French war.|$|E
25|$|The {{nucleation}} reaction {{can start}} with any heterogeneous surface, such as rock salt, but Mentos {{have been found to}} work better than most. Tonya Coffey, a physicist at Appalachian State University, found that the aspartame in diet drinks lowers the surface tension in the water and causes a bigger reaction, but that caffeine does not accelerate the process. It has also been shown that a wide variety of beverage additives such as sugars, citric acid, and natural flavors can also enhance fountain heights. In some cases, dissolved solids that increase the surface tension of water (such as sugars) also increase fountain heights. These results suggest that additives serve to enhance geyser heights not by decreasing surface tension, but rather by decreasing bubble coalescence. Decreased bubble coalescence leads to smaller bubble sizes and greater foaming ability in water. Thus, the geyser reaction will still work even using sugared drinks, but diet is commonly used both for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> larger geyser as well as to avoid having to clean up a sugary soda mess.|$|E
25|$|Life {{in his own}} monastery proved no more congenial than before. For this Abelard {{himself was}} partly responsible. He took a sort of {{malicious}} pleasure in irritating the monks. As if for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> joke, he cited Bede {{to prove that the}} believed founder of the monastery of St Denis, Dionysius the Areopagite had been Bishop of Corinth, while the other monks relied upon the statement of the Abbot Hilduin that he had been Bishop of Athens. When this historical heresy led to the inevitable persecution, Abelard {{wrote a letter to the}} Abbot Adam in which he preferred to the authority of Bede that of Eusebius of Caesarea's Historia Ecclesiastica and St. Jerome, according to whom Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth, was distinct from Dionysius the Areopagite, bishop of Athens and founder of the abbey, though, in deference to Bede, he suggested that the Areopagite might also have been bishop of Corinth. Adam accused him of insulting both the monastery and the Kingdom of France (which had Denis as its patron saint); life in the monastery grew intolerable for Abelard, and he was finally allowed to leave.|$|E

25|$|Beginning {{at the end}} of January, he {{performed}} with his Wonder Horses for several weeks on the Keith-Albee-Orpheum Circuit at the New York Hippodrome. His 15-minute presentation was far above the average horse act, but did not begin to compare with John Aggee's equines that had appeared previously in the same setting at the Hippodrome. The two acts were different. Joyce's presentation was the typical circus offering of the kind where the animals followed set routines. It opened with a high school turn with various types of 1 and 2 steps to music with Joyce in the saddle. Then Jack dismounted and put his black steed through a ritual where it knelt and ran between 2 cannons in the ring. Carrying flags it jumped over the cannons and fired them. Later in the engagement, Joyce, for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smoother presentation, replaced this part of the act with a riding turn. Next, the drollery of an English comic brought forth mild laughter. Cossack trick riding with various unique feats scored well as the horse and rider raced around the ring. Following came 6 showy equines with royal plumes and glittering harness. They did a nice drill which ended with their marching {{on the rim of the}} ring curb. The horses were somewhat hesitant in their movements and notably nervous, probably as a result of experiencing the very rough ocean crossing just two weeks earlier.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to Jim, Dwight, Kevin, and Erin in {{the warehouse}} was more mixed. Sepinwall criticized the warehouse subplot for [...] "selling them [...] out for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> joke". Forcella, who gave {{the majority of the}} episode a positive review, was more critical of the installments subplot. Andrew Daglas of ChicagoNow, on the other hand, was more positive towards the subplot, calling it [...] "generally amusing". He called [...] "Ellie Kemper with a smudge of dirt" [...] on her face [...] "totes [...] adorbs." ...|$|E
500|$|A March 2015 {{article in}} Bloomberg said an {{increasing}} number of executive staff at Kaspersky Lab previously worked for Russian military and intelligence agencies.

[...] Competitor FireEye said many U.S. IT companies also have executives that formerly worked for government military and intelligence agencies. NPR reported that Kaspersky has been doing an increasing amount of business with Russian cybersecurity agencies to catch cybercriminals. Kaspersky confirmed that Russian agencies are among its government customers.|$|E

500|$|She {{became a}} {{professional}} climber in 1988 {{and the subsequent}} interviews, photoshoots and media appearances led to her becoming a spokesperson for climbing. As Hill explained, competition climbing is [...] "such a different activity than going out and climbing on rock... You're {{in front of all}} these people... You're there to perform." [...] From the beginning of her sport climbing career, Hill was aware that the sport was evolving and growing. For example, she pointed out in an interview that some competition organizers would chop down trees and alter rocks just for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> competition; she could foresee that competitions would all eventually take place on artificial walls for environmental reasons.|$|E
500|$|Michael Tedder of New York {{praised the}} writers work and for giving [...] "nice {{character}} moments" [...] to the cast, particularly Kinsey. He also praised them for giving Kinsey [...] "more to work with", comparing {{her role in}} previous episodes which featured her character being [...] "exaggerated to cartoon levels for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> laugh". ScreenCrush reviewer Damon Houx was slightly more critical with his review, writing that while the cast was quite good, the episode was too struggled with [...] "find stuff for everyone to do", and that the Pete-Erin-Pam and Jim-Stanley-Phyllis subplots [...] "ultimately have nowhere interesting to go". Multiple critics noted similarities between the style of this episode with the early seasons of the series, particularly for its use of callbacks.|$|E
500|$|Critics pay special {{attention}} to Bette's lack of traditional femininity, and her unconventional relationships with two characters. She is described from the outset as having [...] "des qualités d'homme" [...] ("certain manly qualities"), with similar descriptions elsewhere. Her relationship and attitude toward Steinbock, moreover, hint at her masculinity. She commands him into submission, and even binds him with economic constraints by lending him the money to develop his sculpture. Her domination is tempered by maternal compassion, but the couple's relationship is compared to an abusive marriage: [...] "Il fut comme une femme qui pardonne les mauvais traitements d'une semaine à cause des caresses d'un fugitif raccommodement." [...] ("He was like a woman who forgives a week of ill-usage for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> kiss and a brief reconciliation.") ...|$|E

500|$|Aval Appadithan explores {{a number}} of themes such as women's liberation, sex and the chauvinistic {{attitude}} of males. Its central theme is on women and their plight in society, as exemplified by Manju and her relationships. Born to a timid father and a mother with loose moral values, she is also subsequently affected by two people she becomes romantically involved with. One, her college mate, left her to marry someone else for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> job; {{and the second is}} Mano, the son of a Christian priest, who used her to satisfy his lust and then trivialised their relationship by calling her [...] "sister" [...] in front of her parents. These relationships result in her becoming wary of men and developing an aggressive nature towards them. Conversations related to matters like the status of women in contemporary (1978) times and the nature of humankind are frequently seen in the film.|$|E

David James Young, from Sputnikmusic, felt it was the best song on the album, [...] "the best thing about this song is how damn {{infectious}} it is, thus making it an excellent pop song with top harmonies and a synth hook". Andrew Tijs from CitySearch Brisbane stated that it [...] "has the kind of breathless, carnivorous sexuality that Madonna still keeps trying to convince us she has", but it wasn't [...] "the sexual awakening that most have been waiting for [...] to have". For its lyrics, Evan Sawdey from PopMatters said [...] "Hook Me Up" [...] "sacrifice lyrical clarity for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> good hook".|$|E
500|$|Bushnell did {{not want}} to appoint Hanna, and offered the seat to Congressman Theodore Burton, a member of neither faction, who turned it down. [...] Historian Wilbur Jones speculates that the seat was refused because of Burton's unwillingness to {{alienate}} Hanna's supporters, an action which might sacrifice a career in the House of Representatives for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few months in the Senate. [...] The governor considered other options, such as arranging to get the position himself or calling a special session of the legislature and have them elect a new senator. [...] However, Bushnell eventually decided that appointing someone else was not worth risking the wrath of the new presidential administration, and of Hanna (who was chairman of the Republican National Committee). [...] In late February 1897, McKinley sent a personal emissary, his old friend Judge William R. Day, to Bushnell, and the governor yielded. [...] Hanna was given his commission by Governor Bushnell in the lobby of Washington's Arlington Hotel on the morning of March5, 1897.|$|E
