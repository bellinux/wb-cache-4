5000|$|A boost gauge is a {{pressure}} gauge that indicates manifold air pressure or <b>turbocharger</b> or supercharger <b>boost</b> <b>pressure</b> [...] in an internal combustion engine. They are commonly {{mounted on the}} dashboard, on the driver's side pillar, or in a radio slot.|$|R
25|$|In {{petrol engine}} <b>turbocharger</b> applications, <b>boost</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is limited to}} keep the entire engine system, {{including}} the turbocharger, inside its thermal and mechanical design operating range. Over-boosting an engine frequently causes damage to the engine {{in a variety of}} ways including pre-ignition, overheating, and over-stressing the engine's internal hardware. For example, to avoid engine knocking (also known as detonation) and the related physical damage to the engine, the intake manifold pressure must not get too high, thus the pressure at the intake manifold of the engine must be controlled by some means. Opening the wastegate allows the excess energy destined for the turbine to bypass it and pass directly to the exhaust pipe, thus reducing <b>boost</b> <b>pressure.</b> The wastegate can be either controlled manually (frequently seen in aircraft) or by an actuator (in automotive applications, it is often controlled by the engine control unit).|$|R
50|$|For 2012, Audi {{introduced}} an {{evolution of the}} original car called the R18 ultra and R18 e-tron quattro which won Le Mans. Both the Ultra and e-tron quattro R18 were run at the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans. In addition to the changes required by the regulations (reduced air intake restrictor and 60 litre fuel tank) the car was completely reworked to reduce weight. These changes included Xtrac sequential electrically activated 6-speed racing gearbox with gearbox housing made of new carbon-fiber composite with titanium inserts, carbon clutch, changes to the carbon-fiber composite aluminum honeycomb monocoque built by Dallara, Single Garrett (Honeywell Turbo Technologies) <b>turbocharger</b> with <b>boost</b> <b>pressure</b> limited to 280 kPa absolute, Bosch MS24 engine management, 1 x 45.8 mm diameter air restrictor, OZ magnesium forged wheels, Michelin Radial 360/710R18 front and 370/710R18 rear tires.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to losing the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Petit Le Mans to the Peugeot 908s, Audi updated their R15 for the 2010 season, creating the R15 plus. 2010 Regulations reduced {{the size of}} diesel LMP1 air restrictors and <b>turbocharger</b> <b>boost</b> <b>pressure.</b> However, despite this, Audi's engineering team led by Ulrich Baretzky were able to achieve engine power and performance that was comparable to the 2009 powerplant. Aerodynamic efficiency was also a major area of focus for 2010. The frontal area of the car was redesigned to reveal the raw crash structures. The front fenders were also lowered {{in an effort to}} reduce drag while the concept of air running through the car was abandoned for a more conventional design. The air channel that exited {{to the side of the}} car was redesigned resulting in a more conventional configuration, and a new headlight concept was introduced.

50|$|The {{roots of}} the Group C {{category}} lie in both FIA Group 6 {{and particularly in the}} GTP category introduced by the ACO at Le Mans in the mid-1970s. GTP was a class for roofed prototypes with certain dimensional restrictions, but instead of the more usual limits on engine capacity, it placed limits on fuel consumption. The FIA applied the same concept in its Group C rules. It limited cars to a minimum weight of 800 kg and a maximum fuel capacity of 100 litres. With competitors restricted to five refueling stops within a 1000 kilometer distance, the cars were effectively allowed 600 litres per 1000 kilometers. The FIA hoped this would prevent manufacturers from concentrating solely on engine development; in the late 1970s, a few manufacturers (especially Porsche and Lancia) had dominated sports car racing by simply increasing <b>turbocharger</b> <b>boost</b> <b>pressure,</b> especially in qualifying trim — the 3.2 L Porsche 935 was capable of more than 800 hp. Engines had to be from a recognized manufacturer which had cars homologated in the FIA's Group A Touring Car or Group B GT Car categories.|$|E
5000|$|For {{model year}} 1995, a high {{performance}} model, developed {{in part with}} Porsche, was released and designated the 850 T-5R. Originally {{it was to be}} called 850 plus 5.

The engine was mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission or 5-speed manual transmission, the latter of which was not available in the US. The T-5R was renowned as a sleeper car; despite its boxy, understated appearance, it boasted a drag coefficient of 0.29 and was capable of accelerating from 0 to 60 mi/h km/h in 5.8 - 6.0 seconds (depending on transmission and body type). The top speed was electronically limited to 152.2 mi/h km/h. The vehicle came standard with Pirelli P-Zero tires, providing lateral grip of 0.88 g. The engine tuning was co-developed with Porsche, as was the transmission and other powertrain components. Porsche also aided in designing some of the interior, such as the Alcantara seat inserts. These cars came as standard with nearly every feature available, only a handful of options - such as heated rear seats - were available. On the North American market only two options could be chosen, a trunk-mounted Alpine 6-CD changer and no-cost 16" [...] wheels for a smoother, more comfortable ride and driveability in snow when using all-season tires.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} and theoretical analysis {{is carried out}} to study the response of a multi-cylinder, turbocharged, IDI (indirect injection) compression ignition engine, under transient operating conditions. To this aim, a comprehensive digital computer model is developed which solves the governing differential equations individually for each cylinder, providing thus increased accuracy over previous 'single-cylinder' simulations. Special {{attention has been paid}} for diversifying the transient operation from the steady-state one, providing improved or even new relations concerning combustion, heat transfer to the cylinder walls, friction, turbocharger and aftercooler operation, and dynamic analysis for the transient case. An extended steady state and transient experimental work is conducted on a specially developed engine test bed configuration, located at the authors' laboratory, which is connected to a high-speed data acquisition and processing system. The steady-state measurements are used for the calibration of the individual submodel constants. The transient investigation includes both speed and load changes operating schedules. During each transient test four major measurements are continuously made, i. e. engine speed, fuel pump rack position, main chamber <b>pressure</b> and <b>turbocharger</b> compressor <b>boost</b> <b>pressure.</b> The hydraulic brake coupled to the engine possesses a high mass moment of inertia and long nonlinear load-change times, which together with the indirect injection nature of the engine are important challenges for the simulation code.

40|$|Work has {{proceeded}} intensely {{with the}} objective of completing the commercial prototype system prior {{to the end of the}} contract period. At the time of this report, testing and refinement of the commercial version of the system has not been completed. During this reporting period, several major milestones were reached and many significant lessons were learned. These are described. The experimental retrofit system has achieved all performance objectives in engine dynamometer tests. The prototype commercial version of the system will begin demonstration service on the first of several Santa Maria Area Transit (SMAT) transit buses on February 1, 1999. The commercial system has been redesignated the Electronic Diesel Smoke Reduction System (EDSRS) replacing the original internal pseudonym ADSC. The focus has been narrowed to a retrofit product suitable for installation on existing mechanically-governed diesel engines. Included in this potential market are almost all diesel-powered passenger cars and light trucks manufactured prior to the introduction of the most recent clean diesel engines equipped with particulate traps and electronic controls. Also included are heavy-duty trucks, transit vehicles, school buses, and agricultural equipment. This system is intended to prevent existing diesel engines from overfueling to the point of visible particulate emissions (smoke), while allowing maximum smoke-limited torque under all operating conditions. The system employs a microcontroller and a specialized exhaust particulate emission sensor to regulate the maximum allowable fuel quantity via an adaptive throttle-limit map.

40|$|In {{the last}} 15 years, diesel engines in {{passenger}} cars have evolved rapidly. The combination of performance, fuel consumption, emissions and refinement {{offered by a}} modern diesel engine makes it the preferred engine choice in many sectors of the market. The enormous progress made has resulted from technological improvements such as low swirl 4 -valve per cylinder, direct injection combustion systems complemented by high pressure common rail fuel systems {{and high levels of}} <b>turbocharger</b> <b>boost</b> <b>pressure.</b> The durability and output potential of such engines is strongly linked to the operating temperature of certain key components. Accurate temperature predictions are an essential pre-requisite to the continuing evolution, thus placing emphasis on the need for high quality predictive tools. Despite this, existing methods for predicting heat flux and component operating temperatures in diesel engines rest mainly with methodology developed over 50 years ago, often updated in the light of more recent experimental data. It is questionable how well those methods represent modern diesel engines. In order to look at this issue, the authors have undertaken a wide-ranging experimental and analytical study using a highly instrumented modern diesel engine. The engine had 109 thermocouples implanted into the walls of the cylinders and cylinder head to reveal the spatial variation of temperature and heat flux over a wide range of operating conditions.

40|$|Requirements for {{alternatives}} to diesel-fueled vehicles are developing, particularly in urban centers not {{in compliance with}} mandated air quality standards. An operator of fleets of diesel- powered vehicles {{may be forced to}} either purchase new vehicles or equip some of the existing fleets with engines designed or modified to run on alternative fuels. In converting existing vehicles, the operator can either replace the existing engine or modify it to burn an alternative fuel. Work described in this report addresses the problem of modifying an existing diesel engine to operate on natural gas. Tecogen has developed a technique for converting turbocharged automotive diesel engines to operate as dedicated spark-ignition engines with natural gas fuel. The engine cycle is converted to a more-complete-expansion cycle in which the expansion ratio of the original engine is unchanged while the effective compression ratio is lowered, so that engine detonation is avoided. The converted natural gas engine, with an expansion ratio higher than in conventional spark- ignition natural gas engines, offers thermal efficiency at wide-open- throttle conditions comparable to its diesel counterpart. This allows field conversion of existing engines. Low exhaust emissions can be achieved when the engine is operated with precise control of the fuel air mixture at stoichiometry with a 3 -way catalyst. A Navistar DTA- 466 diesel engine with an expansion ratio of 16. 5 to 1 was converted in this way, modifying the cam profiles, increasing the <b>turbocharger</b> <b>boost</b> <b>pressure,</b> incorporating an aftercooler if not already present, and adding a spark-ignition system, natural gas fuel management system, throttle body for load control, and an electronic engine control system.

50|$|Since less {{positive}} {{pressure can}} {{be present at}} the wastegate actuator as desired boost is approached the wastegate remains closer to a completely closed state.

50|$|Today's WRC cars {{also use}} anti-lag systems which feed air {{directly}} to the exhaust system. The reason is that these systems are more refined, more effective with advanced computer control, and also quieter. Today this kind of system has reached such a refinement that it's even possible to use the system in a road car. A recent example is the Prodrive P2 prototype. The system works by bypassing charge air {{directly to the}} exhaust manifold which acts as a combustor when fuel rich exhaust from the engine meets up with the fresh air from the bypass. This will provide a continuous combustion limited to the exhaust manifold which significantly reduces the heat and pressure loads on the engine and turbocharger. With the latest anti-lag systems the bypass valve can not only be opened or closed but it can actually control the flow of air to the exhaust manifold very accurately. The turbocharger is fitted with a turbo speed sensor and the engine management system has a map based on throttle position and car speed {{which is used to}} find a suitable <b>turbocharger</b> speed and <b>boost</b> <b>pressure</b> for every condition. When the engine alone can’t provide enough exhaust energy to reach the turbo speed/boost demanded by the management system, the bypass valve opens and exhaust manifold combustion begins. This not only reduces turbo load, but it also allows boost to be produced at very low engine speeds where boost was previously limited by compressor surge or exhaust energy. With relatively high boost at low speeds, this makes the low end torque superior even to large naturally aspirated engines. This is loud, and has been banned on some rallies because of the noise it produces.|$|R
5000|$|A ball & {{spring type}} boost {{controller}} uses {{the force of}} a spring acting against the <b>boost</b> <b>pressure</b> to control <b>boost.</b> This is installed with one boost signal line coming from the intake somewhere after the <b>turbocharger,</b> and one <b>boost</b> signal line going to the wastegate. A knob changes the force on the spring which in turn dictates how much pressure is on the ball. The tighter the spring, the more boost that is needed to unseat the ball, and allow the <b>boost</b> <b>pressure</b> to reach the wastegate actuator. There is a bleed hole on the boost controller after the ball, to allow the pressurized air that would be trapped between the wastegate actuator and the ball after it is seated again.

40|$|Increasing {{fuel prices}} and {{environmental}} concern drives {{the research and}} development for the internal combustion engine. Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) is a promising combustion concept with high fuel efficiency and low emissions. The auto-ignition in HCCI combustion has no flame propagation and therefore the combustible mixture is consumed rapidly, even at low temperature. This results in high peak pressure rate and therefore high combustion noise, that limits the possible operating range. The focus of this thesis is to research how the fuel efficiency can be the improved and how the operating range can be extended for a turbocharged light duty multi-cylinder HCCI engine. The research evaluates how different engine settings influence the fuel efficiency, combustion noise and exhaust emissions. It is shown which operating limitations a HCCI engine needs to fulfill regarding; combustion noise, combustion stability, peak cylinder pressure, nitrogen oxides and soot emissions. At increased <b>boost</b> <b>pressure</b> the achieved fuel efficiency has to be balanced against these operating limitations and the real operating range can be very limited, especially at high load. Due to the low exhaust enthalpy from a negative valve overlap HCCI engine the turbocharger function is important. It is shown how efficiency and operating range can be improved by finding a better suited smaller <b>turbocharger.</b> At high <b>boost</b> <b>pressure</b> the pumping losses can be very high in this engine configuration. In engine simulation of the turbocharged HCCI, the correct exhaust valve closing position is fundamental since it controls the mass flow through the engine. It is shown that by controlling the exhaust valve closing position in the engine simulation to have in-cylinder temperature of ~ 1000 K near firing top dead center, gives simulation results that follows experimental engine results well. The short duration exhaust valve event was identified as one source to the pumping losses. The engine simulation results showed that a change of exhaust valve timing could reduce the pumping losses. This was verified with experimental results where the new longer duration exhaust camshaft improved the fuel efficiency and capable operating range. The knowledge on how to operate this turbocharged HCCI engine to improve the fuel efficiency and fulfill the operating limitations, resulted in an operating range from 1000 to 3000 rpm and a load of more than 5 bar BMEP, in that speed range. It is shown that this turbocharged HCCI engine has up to 35 % improvement in fuel efficiency compared to a modern SI engine...|$|R
50|$|MAP sensors measure {{absolute}} <b>pressure.</b> <b>Boost</b> sensors or gauges {{measure the}} amount of pressure above a set absolute pressure. That set absolute pressure is usually 100 kPa.

A MaP sensor will never display a negative reading because it is measuring absolute pressure, where zero is the total absence of pressure.

Vacuum-Boost sensors can display negative readings, indicating vacuum or suction (a condition of lower pressure than the surrounding atmosphere).
