5|$|For the {{construction}} of the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA, with the engineering firm Arup, worked to reduce the noise levels in stations. In order to reduce noise for all future stations starting with the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA is investing in low-vibration track using ties encased in concrete-covered rubber and neoprene pads. Continuously welded rail, which is also being installed, reduces the noise being made by the wheels of trains. The biggest change <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made is in the design of stations. Current stations were built with tile and stone, which bounce sound everywhere, while newer stations will have the ceilings lined with absorbent fiberglass or mineral wool that will direct sound toward the train and not the platform. With less noise from the trains, platform announcements could be heard more clearly. They will be clearer with speakers spaced periodically on the platform, angled so that announcements can be heard by the riders. The Second Avenue Subway has the first stations to test this technology.|$|E

2500|$|This often {{involves}} programming different effects and signal processing {{for use on}} specific songs, to make the songs sound somewhat similar to the studio versions.

2500|$|The {{band has}} been {{categorized}} under many genres of heavy music. Mainly categorized as heavy metal, hard rock, progressive metal and metalcore, Avenged Sevenfold's music {{has evolved over}} most of the band's career. At first, the band's debut album Sounding the Seventh Trumpet consisted almost entirely of a metalcore sound; however, there were several deviations from this genre, most notably in [...] "Streets", which shows a punk rock style, and [...] "Warmness on the Soul", which is a piano ballad. On Waking the Fallen, the band displayed a metalcore style once more, but added more clean singing and leaned a bit more towards metal and bit less close to hardcore. In the band's DVD All Excess, producer Andrew Murdock explained this transition: [...] "When I met the band after Sounding the Seventh Trumpet had come out before they had recorded Waking the Fallen, M. Shadows said to me 'This record is screaming. The record we want to make is going to be half-screaming half-singing. I don't want to scream anymore. And the record after <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> all singing'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Linear accelerators emit {{high energy}} X-rays; {{the process is}} usually {{referred}} to as [...] "X-ray therapy" [...] or [...] "photon therapy." [...] The term [...] "gamma ray" [...] is usually reserved for photons that are emitted from a radioisotope such as cobalt-60 (see below). Such radiation is not substantially different from that emitted by high voltage accelerators. In linear accelerator therapy, the emission head (called [...] "gantry") is mechanically rotated around the patient, in a full or partial circle. The table where the patient is lying, the [...] "couch", can also be moved in small linear or angular steps. The combination of {{the movements of the}} gantry and of the couch makes possible the computerized planning of the volume of tissue <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> irradiated. Devices with a high energy of 6MeV are the most suitable for the treatment of the brain, due to the depth of the target. The diameter of the energy beam leaving the emission head can be adjusted {{to the size of the}} lesion by means of collimators. They may be interchangeable orifices with different diameters, typically varying from 5 to 40mm in 5mm steps, or multileaf collimators, which consist of a number of metal leaflets that can be moved dynamically during treatment in order to shape the radiation beam to conform to the mass to be ablated. [...] Linacs are capable of achieving extremely narrow beam geometries, such as 0.15 to 0.3mm. Therefore, they can be used for several kinds of surgeries which hitherto had been carried out by open or endoscopic surgery, such as for trigeminal neuralgia, etc. The exact mechanism of its effectiveness for trigeminal neuralgia is not known; however, its use for this purpose has become very common. Long-term follow-up data has shown it to be as effective as radiofrequency ablation, but inferior to surgery in preventing the recurrence of pain.|$|E

60|$|The {{sense of}} taste, {{which in the}} lowest animals is {{diffused}} equally over the whole frame, is in ourselves and other higher creatures concentrated in a special part of the body, namely the mouth, where the food about to be swallowed is chewed and otherwise prepared beforehand {{for the work of}} digestion. Now it is, of course, quite clear that some sort of supervision must be exercised by the body over the kind of food <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> put into it. Common experience teaches us that prussic acid and pure opium are undesirable food-stuffs in large quantities; that raw spirits, petroleum, and red lead should be sparingly partaken of by the judicious feeder; and that even green fruit, the bitter end of cucumber, and the berries of deadly nightshade are unsatisfactory articles of diet when continuously persisted in. If, at the very outset of our digestive apparatus, we hadn't a sort of automatic premonitory adviser upon the kinds of food we ought or ought not to indulge in, we should naturally commit considerable imprudences in the way of eating and drinking--even more than we do at present. Natural selection has therefore provided us with a fairly efficient guide in this respect in the sense of taste, which is placed at the very threshold, as it were, of our digestive mechanism. It is the duty of taste to warn us against uneatable things, and to recommend to our favourable attention eatable and wholesome ones; and, on the whole, in spite of small occasional remissness, it performs this duty with creditable success.|$|E
