40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a study of}} shipbuilding and timber management in the Royal Dockyards in the period 1750 – 1850, focusing on an archaeological investigation of ship timber marks. The first chapter outlines the concept of <b>timber</b> <b>marking</b> in shipbuilding contexts, stressing the multi-disciplinary approach to the study highlighted in the available archaeological and documentary evidence by which the practice of <b>timber</b> <b>marking</b> can be understood. Chapter two outlines the background to <b>timber</b> <b>marking</b> in the Georgian era {{and the development of}} the practice within the broader advances made in shipbuilding, technology and design prior {{to the end of the}} 17 th century. Chapter three outlines the developments in shipbuilding and the introduction of systems to control and standardise the management of timber in the Royal Dockyards in the 18 th century. In the latter half of the 18 th century we will see the attempts of naval reformers to develop these systems of timber management and pave the way for the sweeping changes made at the beginning of the 19 th century. Chapter four highlights these changes with the introduction of the Timber Masters and looks at the nature of timber management and the marking of timbers as identified in documentary sources. This evidence lays the foundation for the understanding of <b>timber</b> <b>marking</b> in the 19 th century as witnessed in the archaeological record. The remaining chapters present the much more extensive archaeological evidence for <b>timber</b> <b>marking</b> among several high profile assemblages. The main assemblages presented in Chapters 5 to 9 show the diversity of <b>timber</b> <b>marking</b> practices and how they relate to the working processes of the Royal Dockyards. The research offers new insights into the understanding of shipbuilding and the management of timber in the Royal Dockyards between 1750 and 1850 and explores the possibilities for further avenues of study.

40|$|On February 11, 1998, the U. S. Forest Service (USFS) {{requested}} that {{a representative of}} NIOSH conduct a health hazard evaluation (HHE) to evaluate and compare timber marker's (also called Forestry Technicians) exposures to a new waterborne formulation of tree marking paint developed {{for use by the}} U. S. Forestry Service. NIOSH performed several previous investigations to document Forestry Technician's exposures to alkyd enamel tree marking paint traditionally used by the USFS for <b>timber</b> <b>marking</b> operations. On May 18, 1998, two NIOSH industrial hygienists met with USFS employees and management representatives in LaGrande, Oregon, where an opening conference was conducted to discuss details of this investigation which occurred on may 19 - 21, 1998, at the Little Bear timber sale in the Catherine Creek Wildlife Unit located approximately 25 miles southeast of LaGrande...|$|E
40|$|To {{be able to}} {{estimate}} the commercial wood assortment of forests at all times is an important requirement of economical wood production. This {{makes it possible to}} improve management decisions by quantifying the revenues of alternative silvicultural and bucking strategies. So far a functional simulaton instrument for bucking single trees and whole stands was missing in forestry and in forest science in Switzerland. The SorSim bucking simulator of the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) fills this gap. SorSim is implemented in Java and is platform-independent. An overview is given how the simulator works. Two examples show applications in practice and science. Of particular value is the possibility of estimating wood assortments of planned harvesting operations based on simple <b>timber</b> <b>marking</b> protocols. Especially in science and in strategic planning, SorSim allows the analysis of the long-term development of revenues of forest stands given different silvicultural methods. Combining SorSim with IT-based harvesting productivity models provides greater insight. Further development of SorSim entails testing different optimization approaches, e. g. single tree bucking to value and whole stand bucking to order...|$|E

50|$|Assembly or {{marriage}} marks {{were used}} to identify the individual <b>timbers.</b> Assembly <b>marks</b> include numbering to identify {{the pieces of the}} frame.

These marks are chiseled, cut with a race knife (a tool to cut lines and circles in wood), or saw cuts. The numbering can also be in Arabic numerals which are often written with a red grease pencil or crayon. German and French carpenters made some unique marks. (Abbundzeichen (German assembly marks)).|$|R
