5|$|August 30, 1839– A {{hurricane}} {{that remains}} offshore {{of the state}} forced <b>the</b> <b>floating</b> light in Sandy Hook to break loose and set adrift.|$|E
5|$|Harbour ferry services, {{operated}} by Bristol Ferry Boats and Number Seven Boat Trips, call at a landing stage in <b>the</b> <b>Floating</b> Harbour outside the station. The service links Bristol Bridge, St Augustine's Reach in the City Centre, the SS Great Britain, and Hotwells.|$|E
50|$|Many floats, {{along with}} their drive train, include {{computer-controlled}} robotic mechanisms to animate <b>the</b> <b>floats.</b> Most float drivers can only see the ground below them. An observer communicates by intercom to the driver. Most observers are hidden within <b>the</b> <b>float</b> and have limited visibility. Each float has a Tournament Member (Float Liaison) assigned to it who shepherds <b>the</b> <b>float</b> from <b>the</b> <b>float</b> barn to <b>the</b> formation area and down the parade route. Most ride on motor scooters although some walk. <b>The</b> <b>Float</b> Liaisons communicate with <b>the</b> <b>float's</b> observer by hand signals. At the two corners other Tournament Members direct <b>the</b> <b>floats</b> in addition to <b>the</b> <b>Float</b> Liaisons.|$|R
50|$|Recent {{modifications}} to <b>the</b> <b>float</b> include <b>the</b> addition of dart like flights {{to the top}} of <b>the</b> <b>float</b> ensuring <b>the</b> <b>float</b> flies straighter when cast over long distances. Another new addition is a washer around the base of <b>the</b> <b>float</b> to stop <b>the</b> <b>float</b> diving under <b>the</b> surface of the water, this is very important when carp are feeding near the surface, as a pellet waggler that dives deep below the surface will scare them.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Spatial {{distribution}} of <b>the</b> Argo <b>floats</b> in <b>the</b> Southern Ocean was simulated {{based on an}} output of a high resolution ocean general circulation model. Giving initial uniform {{distribution of}} <b>the</b> <b>floats,</b> numerical simulations were performed for the parking depths of 2000 m and 1000 m, respectively, with and without sea ice. When the sea ice was ignored, <b>the</b> <b>floats</b> were distributed almost uniformly even four years later but generally showed northward shift. Under sea ice condition, most of <b>the</b> <b>floats</b> were lost south of 62 °S one year after <b>the</b> <b>float</b> deployment while most of <b>the</b> <b>floats</b> survived north of 53 °S if the sea ice concentration was considered as the survival rate of <b>the</b> <b>float</b> in <b>the</b> corresponding region...|$|R

5|$|In central Bristol, {{where the}} river is tidal, it is {{diverted}} from its original course into the New Cut, a channel dug between 1804 and 1809 {{at a cost of}} £600,000. The original course is held at a constant level by lock gates (designed by Jessop) and is known as <b>the</b> <b>Floating</b> Harbour. <b>The</b> <b>Floating</b> Harbour is protected by an 1870s replacement for Jessop's locks. This unusual dock has a tentacled plan resulting from its origins as the natural river course of the Avon and its tributaries, the River Frome and Siston Brook, and is intimately entwined with Bristol's city centre as few docks are. As a result of this, <b>the</b> <b>Floating</b> Harbour {{is one of the more}} successful pieces of dockland regeneration, with much of the dockside now occupied by residential, office and cultural premises, and the water area heavily used by leisure craft. <b>The</b> <b>Floating</b> Harbour gave the port an advantage by enabling shipping to stay afloat rather than grounding when the tide went down. Downstream of central Bristol the river passes through the deep Avon Gorge, spanned by Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge, the river is tidal and is navigable by seagoing vessels at high tide but drying to a steep sided muddy channel at low tide. It was largely the challenge of navigating this section that sealed the fate of <b>the</b> <b>Floating</b> Harbour as commercial docks and saw them replaced by docks at Avonmouth where the Avon joins the Severn Estuary.|$|E
5|$|The B had a goods depot at Pylle Hill (south of the station) from 1850, and the MR had an {{independent}} yard at Avonside Wharf {{on the opposite}} side of <b>the</b> <b>Floating</b> Harbour from 1858.|$|E

The bug's head is at left and it is straddling several women seated on <b>the</b> <b>float.</b> Large models of sunflowers line the sides of <b>the</b> <b>float.</b> Strings of lights can be seen along <b>the</b> <b>float,</b> including on <b>the</b> grasshopper's legs...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Rallo and a {{reluctant}} Donna {{sign up to}} make a <b>float</b> for <b>the</b> Stoolbend Thanksgiving Parade. As Rallo starts to work on <b>the</b> <b>float,</b> Arianna's snide attitude changes Donna's and she jumps into <b>the</b> <b>float</b> building as well. But Rallo's avant-garde design ideas conflict with Donna's traditional ideas. When she finally gets <b>the</b> <b>float</b> to her liking, Rallo enlists his friends to trash <b>the</b> <b>float.</b>|$|R
50|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>float's</b> {{mission is}} over and the data {{collected}} by the satellites, one major step is to compute <b>the</b> <b>float's</b> route over time. This is done {{by looking at the}} travel time of the signals from the moored speakers to <b>the</b> <b>float,</b> computed from <b>the</b> emission time (known accurately), the reception time (known from <b>the</b> <b>float's</b> clock and corrected if the clock had moved). Then, because the speed of sound is known to 0.3% in sea, the position of <b>the</b> <b>float</b> can be determined to about 1 km by an iterative circular tracking procedure. The doppler effect can also be taken into account. Since <b>the</b> <b>float's</b> speed is not known, a first closing speed is determined by measuring the shift in time arrival between two transmissions, where <b>the</b> <b>float</b> is considered not to have moved.|$|R
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{studied by}} Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute researchers {{off the island}} of Sardinia show random social behavior while feeding, and their social behavior {{does not depend on}} feeding activity. In Sardinia, the presence of a floating marine fin-fish farm has been linked to a change in bottlenose dolphin distribution as a result of high fish density around <b>the</b> <b>floating</b> cages in the farming area.|$|E
5|$|Bristol City Council {{built over}} 15,000 houses between 1919 and 1939, {{enabling}} clearance {{of some of}} the worst slums in the city centre. The new estates were at Southmead, Knowle, Filwood Park, Sea Mills and Horfield. The city boundaries were extended to north and south to accommodate this growth. In 1926, the Portway, a new road along the Avon Gorge built at a cost of around £800,000, was opened linking <b>the</b> <b>floating</b> harbour to the expanding docks at Avonmouth.|$|E
5|$|Floating {{storage and}} {{offloading}} units (FSO) are used worldwide by the offshore oil industry to receive oil from nearby platforms and store {{it until it}} can be offloaded onto oil tankers. A similar system, <b>the</b> <b>floating</b> production storage and offloading unit (FPSO), {{has the ability to}} process the product while it is on board. These floating units reduce oil production costs and offer mobility, large storage capacity, and production versatility.|$|E
50|$|While many {{distinct}} {{changes have}} taken place with <b>the</b> Festival's <b>floats,</b> including computer-aided movement and professional <b>float</b> building, <b>the</b> <b>floats</b> have kept true to the event's title and heritage, by using real, fresh flowers. The cost of flowers {{is included in the}} total cost of <b>the</b> <b>float</b> and paid for by <b>the</b> <b>float</b> sponsor.|$|R
5000|$|Judging {{occurs on}} the {{two days before the}} parade. In the first day's judging, <b>the</b> <b>float</b> is viewed [...] "at rest", without any animation, sound, or riders. <b>The</b> <b>float</b> builder is allowed to explain <b>the</b> <b>float</b> to <b>the</b> judges before the judges begin their examination. In the second judging, <b>the</b> <b>float</b> is judged as it will be {{presented}} in the parade, with all animation, riders, outwalkers, and effects. Each judging session lasts five minutes.|$|R
50|$|The {{critical}} {{capability of}} an Argo float {{is its ability}} to rise and descend in the ocean on a programmed schedule. <b>The</b> <b>floats</b> do this by changing their effective density. The density of any object is given by its mass divided by its volume. <b>The</b> Argo <b>float</b> keeps its mass constant, but by altering its volume, it changes its density. To do this, mineral oil is forced out of <b>the</b> <b>float's</b> pressure case and expands a rubber bladder at the bottom end of <b>the</b> <b>float.</b> As <b>the</b> bladder expands, <b>the</b> <b>float</b> becomes less dense than seawater and rises to the surface. Upon finishing its tasks at <b>the</b> surface, <b>the</b> <b>float</b> withdraws <b>the</b> oil and descends again.|$|R
5|$|Following a brief naval {{bombardment}} {{the troops}} on Maaloy succeeded in securing the island; however, the four troops in Vaagso experienced considerable {{resistance from the}} German garrison and their attack up the main street briefly stalled before Durnford-Slater signalled Haydon requesting <b>the</b> <b>floating</b> reserve be released to him and No. 6 Troop under Peter Young were ferried across from Maaloy.|$|E
5|$|In 1612 Robert Aldworth, Mayor of Bristol, rebuilt St Peter's Hospital {{on a site}} between St Peter's Church and <b>the</b> <b>Floating</b> Harbour. This 'beautiful {{house with}} its {{elaborate}} carving' became the Bristol Mint in 1695, and {{was considered to be}} Bristol's greatest architectural loss of the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the state {{government}} conducted a feasibility study for a second floating bridge across Lake Washington, in response to increased traffic on the bridge. In 1953, the Washington State Legislature approved {{the construction of a}} second floating bridge, using past and future tolls to fund its construction. The west end of <b>the</b> <b>floating</b> bridge would be connected to the Everett–Seattle tollway (later Interstate 5) at Roanoke Street, south of the planned Ship Canal Bridge, as well as the proposed Empire Way Expressway at Montlake. The east end would be connected to a north–south freeway bypass of the Seattle area, which later became Interstate 405. Two alignments for <b>the</b> <b>floating</b> bridge were considered in the late 1950s: a Sand Point–Kirkland, favored by the City of Seattle; and an Evergreen Point crossing, favored by {{the state government}} and the U.S. Navy, which operated Naval Air Station Sand Point. The state government initially chose the Montlake–Evergreen Point alignment in 1954, intending to begin construction in 1955, but the alignment dispute delayed a final decision until December 1956. Citizen groups from the Montlake area protested the decision, but were largely ignored by the project's citizen committee.|$|E
50|$|Here {{the spear}} gun is {{connected}} to a buoy via a float rope. After spearing a fish, the spearfisher detaches <b>the</b> <b>float</b> rope and uses a speed stick (a metal spike) attached to <b>the</b> <b>float</b> rope to thread the fish onto <b>the</b> <b>float</b> rope through its gills. The fish will then gradually slide up <b>the</b> <b>float</b> rope as <b>the</b> diver swims until it rests underneath the buoy. When shooting larger fish, the diver can {{let go of his}} gun and play the fish from <b>the</b> <b>float</b> line, giving <b>the</b> fish more room to tire and preventing it from tearing off the spear or dragging the spearfisher under the water.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{self-propelled}} <b>float</b> in <b>the</b> Tournament of Roses Parade, Pasadena, ca. 1906. <b>The</b> ship-shaped <b>float,</b> {{covered in}} {{various types of}} light-colored flowers, is just right of center. <b>The</b> <b>float</b> is moving left {{in front of a}} sidewalk as well as a pathway to a California Bungalow home in the background. At least six women in light-colored dresses and bonnets are seated in the stern on the vessel, just above the banner identifying <b>the</b> parade. <b>The</b> <b>float</b> is decorated with at least five lantern-shaped flower arrangements that can be seen hanging from <b>the</b> <b>float.</b> A placard toward the bow identifies <b>the</b> <b>float</b> as "A- 24 " and four wheels are slightly visible from below the undercarriage of <b>the</b> <b>float...</b>|$|R

5|$|Madre de Deus {{attracted}} {{all manner}} of traders, dealers, cutpurses and thieves from miles around, from as far as London and beyond. At seeing this huge vessel, pandemonium broke out amongst the townspeople; they visited <b>the</b> <b>floating</b> castle and sought out drunken sailors in taverns and pubs, buying, stealing, pinching and fighting for the takings. Local fishermen as well ventured aboard, further depleting the cargo.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Nurse Edwards (Vernee Watson-Johnson) confronts Preijers {{about an}} {{injection}} {{she saw him}} give Reyes; he kills Edwards to cover his tracks. Later, in <b>the</b> <b>floating</b> hospital, Stephen collapses and disappears when he too is pulled off of life support. After Doggett is spotted with Audrey in the basement by Preijers, he begins to worry that she could expose what he is doing. He injects the same drug he used to kill Edwards, but Audrey is able to concentrate and move into <b>the</b> <b>floating</b> hospital one last time. She informs Reyes that her only way out is {{to jump into the}} void. Reyes does so and wakes up in her hospital bed moments before her organs are to be harvested. Doggett runs down to Audrey's room only to find that Preijers has killed her. Doggett manages to capture Preijers before he can escape.|$|E
5|$|Planning for {{the large}} Finzels Reach {{development}} across <b>the</b> <b>Floating</b> Harbour from Castle Park, including the old Georges Brewery buildings, was first granted in 2006 but progress was hampered by the recession and the developers went into receivership. By 2015 the development is part complete with the historic waterfront facade still awaiting regeneration.|$|E
2500|$|Float type carburetors {{are able}} to {{compensate}} for these unstable conditions through various design features, but only within reason. For example, once <b>the</b> <b>float</b> type carburetor is under negative g conditions, such as a rapid nose down attitude, <b>the</b> <b>float</b> lifts toward <b>the</b> top of the fuel bowl as <b>the</b> <b>float</b> becomes weightless when the aircraft descends faster than <b>the</b> <b>float</b> and <b>the</b> fuel. <b>The</b> <b>float</b> is [...] lifted upward by inertia, closing the fuel inlet valve as if the fuel bowl was full of fuel. Cutting off the fuel supply causes the fuel-air ratio to become greater than sixteen to one, which is then too lean for combustion to take place, stopping the engine.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>floats</b> are {{typically}} multilevel, {{with a lower}} and upper level, {{and one or two}} mezzanine stations (typically near the back of <b>the</b> <b>float).</b> <b>The</b> <b>float</b> [...] "captain" [...] typically rides on the upper level, which lets him or her see everyone on <b>the</b> <b>float.</b> For floats in night-time parades, the structures are wired for lighting, and a portable generator is towed behind <b>the</b> <b>float</b> to provide power. Each float also contains some type of portable restroom facilities. Although from the street, a Mardi Gras float might look like a dainty, flimsy contraption, the reality is that they are quite sturdily built and are capable of withstanding a good rocking by the riders.Some of Mobile's most famous floats include: ...|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after her}} arrival New Jersey was {{opened to the}} public, officially {{beginning}} her new career as a museum ship with the name Battleship New Jersey Museum and Memorial. Self-guided tours, guided group tours, and overnight encampments are offered on <b>the</b> <b>floating</b> museum.

5|$|The 300-seat {{restaurant}} at Kampoeng Rawa floats {{in a small}} lake and serves Indonesian dishes using locally produced ingredients, including catfish, gourami, and tilapia. Dishes included nasi goreng and mie goreng. Customers can sit in the main hall or one of <b>the</b> <b>floating</b> gazebos. All are floated by plastic drums, and to reach the main hall customers must use covered boats which are guided by a rope.|$|E
5|$|The Kennet and Avon Canal is a canal in {{southern}} England. The name may refer {{to either the}} route of the original Kennet and Avon Canal Company, which linked the River Kennet at Newbury to the River Avon at Bath, or to the entire navigation between the River Thames at Reading and <b>the</b> <b>Floating</b> Harbour at Bristol, including the earlier improved river navigations of the River Kennet between Reading and Newbury and the River Avon between Bath and Bristol.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> square, <b>the</b> <b>float</b> {{is ready}} to leave. Michelle has dressed up in officer Crabtree's spare uniform, {{to be able to}} tag along, by {{claiming}} to escort <b>the</b> <b>float.</b> Crabtree then announces all of the participants of <b>the</b> <b>float,</b> as they come out of the café and climb on board. First comes a prawn in a wheelchair, driven by an octopuss (madame Fanny and monsieur LeClerc). They are followed by two mermaids (Yvette and Mimi) and then comes king Neptune and Venus unadorned (René and Edith). Finally comes two crabs (Gruber and Von Strohm). Just as <b>the</b> <b>float</b> is about to leave, the general drives into the square and finds the two officers there. He naturally demands Gruber and Von Strohm get off <b>the</b> <b>float</b> and out of the costumes. Monsieur Alfonse then drives <b>the</b> <b>float</b> out of <b>the</b> square, towards the coast.|$|R
50|$|If {{the valve}} body {{is filled with}} water, <b>the</b> <b>float</b> moves upwards and closes the valve. If air {{collects}} in the valve body, the waterline lowers, as does <b>the</b> <b>float,</b> and <b>the</b> valve opens to release it. To give more sealing force on <b>the</b> valve, <b>the</b> <b>float</b> generally works <b>the</b> valve through a lever. A greater movement of <b>the</b> <b>float</b> gives a shorter, but more forceful, movement of the valve. This lever mechanism may be simply, almost crudely, made of a pressed steel strip which acts as a bending hinge.|$|R
5000|$|A Bug's Life Unit: <b>The</b> longest <b>float</b> in <b>the</b> parade, it {{features}} Flik and Atta on a two-person swing with Dot looking on, {{along with two}} larger swings in the back portion of <b>the</b> <b>float</b> capable of swinging almost 360-degrees {{around the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>float.</b> Heimlich leads <b>the</b> <b>float,</b> pushing a water-squirting flower with him, occasionally splitting into multiple portions as he walks.
