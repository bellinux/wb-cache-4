40|$|A {{companion}} {{paper to}} an AIAA Off-the-Drawing-Board Presentation, 36 th Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit Reno, NV, January 1998. Fully reusable two-stage-to-orbit vehicle designs that incorporate ‘branching’ trajectories during their ascent are of current {{interest in the}} advanced launch vehicle design community. Unlike expendable vehicle designs, the booster of a reusable system must fly to a designated landing site after staging. Therefore, both the booster return branch and the orbital upper stage branch along with the lower ascent trajectory are of interest after the staging point and must be simultaneously optimized {{in order to achieve}} an overall system objective. Current and notable designs in this class include the U. S. Air Force Space Operations Vehicle designs with their ‘pop-up’ Trajectories and NASA’s proposed liquid flyback booster designs (Space Shuttle solid booster upgrade). The solution to this problem using an industry standard trajectory optimization code (POST) typically requires at least two separate computer jobs — one for the orbital branch from the ground to orbit and one for the booster branch from the staging point to the landing site. However, these two jobs are tightly coupled and their data requirements are interdependent. This paper expounds upon the research necessary to improve the accuracy, computational efficiency, and data consistency with which this <b>twin</b> <b>job</b> problem can be solved. In particular, the proposed methods originate from the field of Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO). The planned research program is outlined, and preliminary results are reporte...|$|E

5000|$|Soderholm won the <b>Twins</b> regular <b>job</b> {{at third}} base in 1974 and had two solid seasons as their starter. He then injured his knee and missed the entire 1976 campaign. The White Sox took a gamble and signed Soderholm as a Free Agent in November 1976. The move paid off as Soderholm responded with a career year in 1977, hitting [...]280 and {{slugging}} 25 home runs. Soderholm stroked 16 of his 25 homers after the All-Star break {{to help keep the}} South Side Hitmen, as the Sox were fondly known that year, in the AL West pennant race into September.|$|R
50|$|During {{their four}} seasons in New Haven, the Cutters had {{varying degrees of}} success. Their first season saw them leading the Northeast League South Division {{for most of the}} first half of their season, but the team {{severely}} faltered down the stretch of the first half and ended up losing the division to the eventual league champion New Jersey Jackals in a one-game playoff at Yale Field. The bad streak continued, and the Cutters fell to last place in the division in the second half and cost first-year manager Jarvis Brown, a former Minnesota <b>Twins</b> prospect, his <b>job.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>twins</b> {{consider}} their <b>job</b> done and grant their father's wish {{of having a}} burial at sea {{with the assistance of}} Bryn's boat, with the coffin respectfully draped in the Welsh flag. It is a poignant moment as the local choir (formed from a number of real-life local male voice choirs) sing the Welsh language song Myfanwy at the end of Mumbles Pier. Meanwhile, Terry Walsh, terrified and pleading, has been gagged and bound to the coffin, and lowered into the sea just off the pier head of Mumbles Swansea. The coffin floats for a while before the twins make a bet to how long the coffin would stay afloat, seemingly brushing aside the emotion of their father's funeral at sea.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the start}} of The Hogan Familys sixth and final season, John Hillerman joined the cast as Sandy and Michaels father, Lloyd. The season premiere has Mike, Sandy, and the boys visit Lloyd in California, upon hearing {{that he and his}} wife (Mike and Sandys mother) have just been divorced. Lloyd clearly has trouble with the events, and at one point in the hour-long episode goes missing, with the family fearing that he might have been killed boating during a storm. The senior Hogan materializes safe, and in the end, follows the family to Oak Park. During the same season, Cara and Brenda become {{full-time}} regulars, as Mark and Willie (respectively) become steady with them. Also that fall, the <b>twins</b> lose their <b>job</b> at Bossy Burger after Willie pressures Mark to skip work with him in order to see a concert (Sandy and Mrs. Poole filled in for them that evening, impromptu). Eventually, in the episode [...] "A Sneaking Suspicion" [...] (aired July 10, 1991), Mark and Willie get new jobs at a shoe store in the local mall.|$|R
