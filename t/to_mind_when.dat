25|$|Mark Tauber, senior {{vice-president}} of HarperOne, {{has stated that}} the Green Bible was developed {{with the intention of}} being “the first ever specialty bible that takes the issues of sustainability, stewardship of the earth, what many in the religious community call ‘creation care’ very seriously”. He went further, exposing on the Green Bible’s purpose: “That the Bible has a profound message of sustainability—some might argue, the original message—is not all that surprising. What is surprising {{is that it is not}} one of the first things that comes <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> most folks think about the Bible and its message... this Bible seeks to change that fact. We believe that the unique and specially added features by some of today's most important thinkers, writers and leaders, across the ecumenical spectrum make it a must-have for those who already find motivation, comfort and inspiration in it and for the many more who might see it freshly as a critical resource in their journey to sustain our planet”.|$|E

But that is the emotion—subterranean, powerful, beautiful, illicit, and infinitely patient—that suffuses the pages of Khaled Hosseini's A Thousand Splendid Suns. As in his best-selling first novel, The Kite Runner, Hosseini movingly examines the connections between unlikely friends, the fissures that open up between parents and children, the intransigence of quiet hearts." ...|$|E

500|$|Notwithstanding Eisenhower's {{estimation}} of Patton's abilities {{as a strategic}} planner, his overall view of Patton's military value in achieving Allied victory in Europe can best be seen in Eisenhower's refusal to even consider sending Patton home after the slapping incidents of 1943, after which he privately remarked, [...] "Patton is indispensable to the war effort– one of the guarantors of our victory." [...] As Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy told Eisenhower: [...] "Lincoln's remark after they got after Grant comes <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> I think of Patton– 'I can't spare this man, he fights'." [...] After Patton's death, Eisenhower would write his own tribute: [...] "He {{was one of those}} men born to be a soldier, an ideal combat leader... It is no exaggeration to say that Patton's name struck terror at the hearts of the enemy." ...|$|E
500|$|John Cornwell, {{author of}} [...] (1999), praised Daniel Goldhagen's [...] "excellent job in exposing the propagandistic hagiography of recent {{defenders}} of Pius XII, especially {{their tendency to}} confuse diplomatic eulogy with historical fact", but said that Goldhagen errs in identifying a key Vatican figure as an antisemite, a misrepresentation he thinks [...] "can only provide ammunition for the Pius XII lobby". The journalist Gritz noted that Goldhagen [...] "does not cushion his criticisms of the Church in diplomatic language", that [...] "even philosophy professor John K. Roth, who favorably reviewed A Moral Reckoning in the Los Angeles Times, said that the adjectives [...] "unpretentious ... indecisive ... moderate ... patient" [...] do not come <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> reading Goldhagen. Another book review in The New York Times said that A Moral Reckoning is an [...] "impressive and disturbing bill of indictment against" [...] the Roman Catholic Church, yet its imbalanced perspective results in [...] "turning history {{into a kind of}} cudgel".|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} the Linux mascot being a penguin came from Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux. Tux was created by Larry Ewing in 1996 after an initial {{suggestion}} made by Alan Cox and further refined by Linus Torvalds on the Linux kernel mailing list. Torvalds took his inspiration from an image he found on an FTP site, showing a penguin figurine looking strangely like the Creature Comforts characters made by Nick Park. The first person to call the penguin [...] "Tux" [...] was James Hughes, who said that it stood for [...] "(T)orvalds (U)ni(X)". However, tux is also an abbreviation of tuxedo, the outfit which often springs <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> one sees a penguin.|$|E

2500|$|This Image and {{reputation}} {{has become an}} essential part of a [...] "state's strategic equity". [...] Place branding is [...] "the totality of the thoughts, feelings, associations and expectations that come <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> a prospect or consumer is exposed to an entity's name, logo, products, services, events, or any design or symbol representing them." [...] Place branding is required to make a country's image acceptable for investment, tourism, political power, etc. [...] As Joseph Nye commented, [...] "in an information age, it is often the side which has the better side of the story that wins," [...] this has resulted in a shift from old style diplomacy to encompass brand building {{and reputation}} management. [...] In short, a country can use its culture to create a brand for itself which represents positive values and image.|$|E
2500|$|Zulu Architecture was {{constructed}} with more perishable materials. Dome shaped huts typically comes <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> {{one thinks of}} Zulu dwellings, but later on it evolved into dome over cylinder shape walls. Zulu capitals were elliptical in shape. The exterior was lined with durable wood palisade. Domed huts in rows of 6 through 8 lined the interior of exterior palisades. In {{the center of the}} capital city was the kraal, used by the king to examine his soldiers, holding cattle, or ceremonies. It was an empty circular area {{at the center of the}} capital, lined with less durable palisades compared to the exterior palisades. The entrance of the city was opposite to the highly fortified Royal Enclosure called the Isigodlo. [...] This was the general makeup of Zulu capitals Mgungundlovu (King Dingane's capital) and Ulundi (King Cetshwayo's capital).|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four stars and stating that while it is not [...] "a true {{visualization}} of Tolkien's Middle-earth", it is [...] "a work for, and of, our times. It will be embraced, I suspect, by many Tolkien fans and take on aspects of a cult. It is a candidate for many Oscars. It is an awesome production in its daring and breadth, and there are small touches that are just right". USA Today also gave the film {{three out of four}} stars and wrote, [...] "this movie version of a beloved book should please devotees as well as the uninitiated". In his review for The New York Times, Elvis Mitchell wrote, [...] "The playful spookiness of Mr. Jackson's direction provides a lively, light touch, a gesture that doesn't normally come <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> Tolkien's name is mentioned". Entertainment Weekly magazine gave the film an [...] "A" [...] rating and Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, [...] "The cast take to their roles with becoming modesty, certainly, but Jackson also makes it easy for them: His Fellowship flows, never lingering for the sake of admiring its own beauty ... Every detail of which engrossed me. I may have never turned a page of Tolkien, but I know enchantment when I see it".|$|E

2500|$|The di Marcos {{have been}} {{dismissed}} as [...] "unconvincing characters", and Bruno and Luisa were ridiculed, with Baylis suggesting that their [...] "foreign mannerisms would have gone down great in any production of Fiddler On The Roof".
