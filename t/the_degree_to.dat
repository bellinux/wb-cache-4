However, <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> which the Jesuits controlled the indigenous population for which they had responsibility and <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> which they allowed indigenous culture to function is a matter of debate, and the social organization of the reductions have been variously described as jungle utopias on the one hand, to theocratic regimes of terror, the former description being much closer to the mark.|$|E

5|$|In {{psychological}} assessments, the name-letter {{effect has}} been exploited to measure self-esteem.
