5|$|At this point, Australian {{fears of}} a Japanese counterattack grew and they {{requested}} reinforcements from their higher commander, General Douglas MacArthur. However, the request was denied as MacArthur's intelligence staff believed that there were only 350Japanese in the vicinity. Actually, there were already 5,000Japanese around Sattelberg and Finschhafen while throughout early October this number grew to 12,000 {{as they began to}} prepare for their planned counterattack. The Australians received some reinforcements {{in the shape of the}} 2/43rd Infantry Battalion. The arrival of this unit meant that the 2/17th, deadlocked around Jivevaneng, could be freed for the advance on Finschhafen, thus enabling the entire 20th Brigade to concentrate on <b>that</b> <b>objective.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before {{the end of}} 1993, Butcher's {{reign as}} manager {{came to an end}} after 45games in charge, and he was {{replaced}} by Mick Buxton. In a period which included six managers in ten years, Buxton was sacked in 1995. Sunderland's board turned to Peter Reid as temporary manager, in the hopes of keeping Sunderland clear of relegation. <b>That</b> <b>objective</b> was achieved within weeks, and Reid was rewarded with a permanent contract. Reid's first full season as Sunderland manager, 1995–96, was successful; the club won the Division One title and gained promotion to the Premier League {{for the first time since}} the League restructuring which had taken effect in 1992–93. In the 1996–97 season, despite beating Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea they were relegated.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of West German Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik ("Eastern Policy") {{at the end}} of the 1960s reduced tensions between the two German states. It led to a series of treaties and agreements in the early 1970s, most significantly a treaty in which East and West Germany recognised each other's sovereignty and supported each other's applications for UN membership, although East Germans leaving for the West retained the right to claim a West German passport. Reunification remained a theoretical objective for West Germany, but in practice <b>that</b> <b>objective</b> was put aside by the West and abandoned entirely by the East. New crossing points were established and East German crossing regulations were slightly relaxed, although the fortifications were as rigorously maintained as ever.|$|E

About half the students stated that they refer to objectives {{at the beginning of}} each of their study sessions, and 61. 9 percent claimed to read objectives when it is time to consider assessment items. Most students disagreed with the statement <b>that</b> <b>objectives</b> enhance their ability to learn to their full potential; however, 62. 9 percent felt <b>that</b> <b>objectives</b> help measure their understanding of material studied.

5|$|Despite the {{unfavorable}} {{developments in}} South Vietnam, North Vietnamese General Tran Van Tra believed North Vietnam and the Viet Cong could still {{win the war}} if they pursued a strategy of attrition. In other words, the Communists would have to fight on {{for as long as}} possible, until the United States recognized that the war was unwinnable and would disengage from the conflict in Vietnam. To achieve <b>that</b> <b>objective</b> at the tactical level, Tra argued that North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces would have to destroy American military units, and cause as many casualties as possible until they got tired and left. Indeed, towards mid-1967 General Thanh, who had the Viet Cong 7th and 9th Division at his disposal, was out to do just that. In June, U.S. military forces in III Corps Tactical Zone began to detect the build-up of Viet Cong troops in northern Phuoc Vinh located War Zone D. To stop a major enemy attack on Phuoc Vinh, Major General John H. Hay—commander of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division—launched Operation Billings with the objective of trapping three Viet Cong battalions in War Zone D.|$|E
5|$|Following {{extensive}} {{discussions on}} the fighting ability of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, the Political Bureau approved the General Staff’s plan, which had selected the Central Highlands as the main battlefield for the upcoming offensive. The Central Highlands campaign was codenamed ‘Campaign 275’ and {{the goal was to}} capture the city of Ban Me Thuot. To achieve <b>that</b> <b>objective,</b> North Vietnamese General Văn Tiến Dũng placed great emphasis on the principles of massed force, secrecy, and surprise to draw South Vietnamese forces away from the main objective. For the element of surprise to be successful, North Vietnamese forces needed to launch strong diversionary attacks on Pleiku and Kon Tum, thereby leaving Ban Me Thuot completely exposed. Once the element of surprise had been achieved, the North Vietnamese would mass their forces on Ban Me Thuot, and prevent South Vietnamese reinforcements from retaking the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the 2/43rd Infantry Battalion meant that the 2/17th Infantry Battalion could be {{reassembled}} for the advance on Finschhafen, thus enabling the entire 20th Infantry Brigade to concentrate on <b>that</b> <b>objective.</b> On 2 October the 2/17th Infantry Battalion crossed the Bumi without opposition, and found the Salankaua Plantation unoccupied. In mopping up the area, it captured two Japanese stragglers and killed three. By evening Finschhafen was in Australian hands. Between 22 September and 2 October, the 20th Infantry Brigade had taken its objectives. It had lost 73 dead, 276 wounded and nine missing, {{all of whom were}} later accounted for as dead or wounded. The 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment had eight dead and 42 wounded. Two Americans were also killed in the Air Liaison Party.|$|E

40|$|Summary The use of {{learning}} objectives in study materials for external students is an instructional design strategy {{which is generally}} accepted. However, {{with the emergence of}} the constructivist paradigm in learning theory, there is the question as to whether the use of objectives, underpinned by behaviourist theory, is justified. This study was undertaken to investigate the distance education student's disposition towards objectives, with particular reference to the way they used them and to what their perceptions and expectations were. Responses to a questionnaire revealed <b>that</b> <b>objectives</b> were perceived by the majority of the students sampled as useful to their studies, and <b>that</b> <b>objectives,</b> for them, were an integral part of their learning strategy...|$|R
25|$|When Søren Kierkegaard, as his {{character}} Johannes Climacus, ends his writings: My thesis was, subjectivity, heartfelt is the truth, {{he does not}} advocate for subjectivism in its extreme form (the theory that something is true simply because one believes it to be so), but rather that the objective approach to matters of personal truth cannot shed any light upon that which is most essential to a person's life. Objective truths {{are concerned with the}} facts of a person's being, while subjective truths are concerned with a person's way of being. Kierkegaard agrees <b>that</b> <b>objective</b> truths for the study of subjects like mathematics, science, and history are relevant and necessary, but argues <b>that</b> <b>objective</b> truths do not shed any light on a person's inner relationship to existence. At best, these truths can only provide a severely narrowed perspective that {{has little to do with}} one's actual experience of life.|$|E

40|$|Secondary game <b>objectives,</b> {{optional}} challenges <b>that</b> {{players can}} choose to pursue or ignore, are a fundamental element of game design. Still, {{little is known about}} how secondary objectives affect player behavior. It is commonly believed <b>that</b> secondary <b>objectives</b> such as coins or collectible items can increase a game’s flexibility, replayability, and depth. In contrast, we present results from analysis of two popular online Flash games showing <b>that</b> secondary <b>objectives</b> can easily harm the retention of many players. We support our findings with data collected from over 27, 000 players through large-scale A/B tests in which we measured play time, progress, and return rate. We show <b>that</b> while secondary <b>objectives</b> can encourage long-term players to extend their playtime, they can also cause many players to play for less time. By modifying secondary <b>objectives</b> so <b>that</b> they reinforce the primary goal of the game instead of distracting from it, we are able to avoid negative consequences and still maintain the retention of long-term players. Our results suggest <b>that</b> secondary <b>objectives</b> <b>that</b> support the primary goal of the game are consistently useful, while secondary <b>objectives</b> <b>that</b> do not support the main goal require extensive testing to avoid negative consequences...|$|R
