5|$|Shawn Adolf was {{retained}} in prison on a $1 million bond for several outstanding warrants involving drug charges. He was initially charged with {{possession of a}} firearm by a prohibited person, possession of body armor by a violent felon and possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute. On November 6, 2009, Adolf pleaded guilty to the firearm possession charge, {{and the other two}} charges were dropped. On February 5, 2010, Adolf was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison over the weapons charges; <b>that</b> <b>sentence</b> is concurrent with Adolf's subsequent sentence on March 15 to 10 years in Colorado state prison on unrelated robbery charges.|$|E

25|$|Dependency is a {{one-to-one}} correspondence: {{for every}} element (e.g. word or morph) in the sentence, there is exactly one node {{in the structure}} of <b>that</b> <b>sentence</b> that corresponds to that element. The result of this one-to-one correspondence is that dependency grammars are word (or morph) grammars. All that exist are the elements and the dependencies that connect the elements into a structure. This situation should be compared with the constituency relation of phrase structure grammars. Constituency is a one-to-one-or-more correspondence, which means that, for every element in a sentence, there are one or more nodes in the structure that correspond to that element. The result of this difference is that dependency structures are minimal compared to their constituency structure counterparts, since they tend to contain many fewer nodes.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, as {{a result}} of an {{incident}} in Las Vegas, regarding an attempt to reacquire materials Simpson claimed were stolen from him, Simpson was convicted of multiple felonies including use of a deadly weapon to commit kidnapping, burglary and armed robbery, and sentenced to a minimum 9 years to a maximum 33 years in prison. His attempts to appeal <b>that</b> <b>sentence</b> were unsuccessful and he resided at Lovelock Correctional Center in Lovelock, Nevada. During his 2013 parole hearing, Simpson was granted parole on all counts except weapons related and the two counts of assault with a deadly weapon. After a July 20, 2017, Nevada parole board hearing voting unanimously 4-0, Simpson was granted parole after a minimum 9-year sentence on the remaining counts for the Vegas robbery with Sunday, October 1, 2017, to be his release date from prison on parole. According to Nevada law if he continues his good behavior, Simpson will have his 33-year sentence reduced by 50% to make September 29, 2022, the end of his sentence. Upon release, Simpson intends to reside near his family in Miami, Florida. Ron Goldman's father and sister, Fred and Kim, did not appear before the board, but stated that they had received about 1% of the $33.5 million that Simpson owes from the wrongful death civil suit.|$|E
25|$|Davidson's work is {{well noted}} for its unity, as he has brought a similar {{approach}} {{to a wide variety}} of philosophical problems. Radical interpretation is a hypothetical standpoint which Davidson regards as basic to the investigation of language, mind, action, and knowledge. Radical interpretation involves imagining that you are placed into a community which speaks a language you do not understand at all. How could you come to understand the language? One suggestion is that you know a theory that generates a theorem of the form 's means that p' for every sentence of the object language (i.e. the language of the community), where s is the name of a sentence in the object language, and p is <b>that</b> <b>sentence,</b> or a translation of it, in the metalanguage in which the theory is expressed. However, Davidson rejects that suggestion on the grounds that the sentential operator 'means that' is sensitive not only to the extensions of the terms that follow it, but also to their intensions. Hence, Davidson replaces 'means that' with a connective sensitive only to the extensions of sentences; since the extension of a sentence is its truth value, this is a truth functional connective. Davidson elects the biconditional (if and only if) as the connective needed in a theory of meaning. He concludes that a theory of meaning must be such that for each sentence of the object language it generates a theorem of the form 's is true if and only if p'. A theory of truth for a language can serve as a theory of meaning.|$|E
500|$|Tripp's {{second edition}} in 1987 {{discussed}} the first edition's reception. [...] He wrote that no sentence in it stirred such a [...] "hateful reaction" [...] as Tripp's comment that, [...] "When {{two men are}} excited and unrestrained in their sexual interaction, the fire that is fed from both sides often does whip up levels of eroticism that are very rarely reached elsewhere." [...] Tripp accused his critic Hendin of using <b>that</b> <b>sentence</b> to wrongly portray him as maintaining that homosexuality is an inherently superior form of sexual expression. The sociologist Jonathan Dollimore described Tripp's account of psychoanalytic theories of homosexuality as an over-simplification bordering on parody.|$|E

5000|$|Ethical cognitivists hold <b>that</b> ethical <b>sentences</b> do express propositions: {{that it can}} be true or false, for example, that Mary is a good person, or that {{stealing}} {{and lying}} are always wrong. Cognitivists believe <b>that</b> these <b>sentences</b> do not just express feelings, as though we were saying, [...] "Hey!" [...] or [...] "Yay for Mary!"; they actually express propositions that can be true or false. Derivatively, a cognitivist or a realist would say <b>that</b> ethical <b>sentences</b> themselves are either true or false. Conversely, if one believes <b>that</b> <b>sentences</b> like [...] "Mary is a good person" [...] cannot be either true or false, then one is a non-cognitivist.|$|R

500|$|Linguistically, ain't {{is formed}} by the same rule that English {{speakers}} use to form aren't and other contractions of auxiliary verbs. Most linguists consider usage of ain't to be grammatical, as long as its users convey their intended meaning to their audience. In other words, a sentence such as [...] "She ain't got no sense" [...] is grammatical because it generally follows a native speaker's word order, and because a native speaker would recognize the meaning of <b>that</b> <b>sentence.</b> Linguists draw a distinction, however, between grammaticality and acceptability: what may be considered grammatical across all dialects may nevertheless be considered not acceptable in certain dialects or contexts. The usage of ain't is socially unacceptable in some situations.|$|E
500|$|Evans {{and another}} footballer, Clayton McDonald, were tried at the Crown Court at Caernarfon after being indicted {{of the rape}} of a 19-year-old woman, who was deemed too drunk to consent, at a hotel near Rhyl in May 2011. Evans was convicted on 20 April 2012 {{and was sentenced to}} five years' imprisonment.

In August 2012, Evans was refused leave to appeal against the conviction by a single Court of Appeal of England and Wales judge and the full court upheld the decision in November.
