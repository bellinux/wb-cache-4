5|$|Johnson's wife Shelly {{is having}} breakfast with her lover Bobby Briggs; the two roleplay {{the idea of}} {{shooting}} Johnson, while they toy with Shelly's pistol. When Deputy Andy Brennan (Harry Goaz) arrives to enquire about Johnson, Briggs hides and Shelly attempts to make Johnson seem deeply involved in Laura's death and Renault's disappearance. Elsewhere, lovers Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) and Norma Jennings (Peggy Lipton) meet to discuss their spouses. Jennings' husband Hank (Chris Mulkey) has been released from prison, while Hurley's volatile wife Nadine is increasingly becoming mentally unwell. Jennings leaves, feeling that <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> nowhere, leaving Hurley crestfallen. Meanwhile, Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) is interviewed for a job at her father's department store and blackmails the interviewer into giving her a position at the shop's perfume counter—where Laura and Ronette Pulaski worked before their abduction.|$|E

Putting him off, she tells him that she will give him an answer in the morning. After he leaves, she is afraid of her feelings, and she heads back to her home. After she arrives, she and Henry realize that the two really love each other, and they reconcile.|$|E
25|$|I think {{global warming}} {{is an issue that}} is {{currently}} relevant, time sensitive, and a symptom of the shortsightedness of the U.S. As a broader metaphor, the drowning Statue of Liberty, a revered icon of the U.S., symbolizes the eminent demise of many of the ideals upon which the nation was founded. Civil liberties, freedom of speech, privacy, etc. have been decreasing since 9/11. The sun in the image could either be setting or rising and this ambiguity shows that there is still hope to turn things around... The U.S. is the dominant global force. When <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> wrong in the U.S. they are probably going wrong around the world. I think this image conveys both the U.S. situation and its larger global implications.|$|E

25|$|Discussions about Fahrenheit 451 often {{center on}} its story {{foremost}} {{as a warning}} against state-based censorship. Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the McCarthy era, {{he was concerned about}} censorship in the United States. During a radio interview in 1956, Bradbury said:I wrote this book at a time when I was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. <b>Things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.|$|E
500|$|Although Brühl {{thought the}} film [...] "very realistic", he was {{dissatisfied}} with his character's authenticity. The actor felt [...] "attached" [...] to Jan, admiring his [...] "courage {{to want to}} change the way <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going,</b> to act to defend his beliefs", but thought it was [...] "very utopian and naive, that they take so much risk to break into some rich man's house to move things around." ...|$|E
500|$|On 18 May 1968, Lennon {{summoned the}} other Beatles {{to a meeting}} at Apple Corps to {{announce}} {{that he was the}} living reincarnation of Jesus: [...] "I have something very important to tell you all. I am Jesus Christ. I'm back again." [...] The meeting was adjourned for lunch and Lennon never mentioned the subject again. In May 1969, Lennon and McCartney recorded [...] "The Ballad of John and Yoko", with Lennon singing the lines, [...] "Christ, you know it ain't easy, You know how hard it can be, The way <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going,</b> They're gonna crucify me." [...] In a BBC interview a few months later, Lennon called himself [...] "One of Christ's biggest fans", talked about the Church of England, his vision of heaven, and unhappiness over being unable to marry Yoko Ono in church.|$|E

This is going to be, like, the ultimate creative orgasm for me 'cause I'm ready to move on. I'm not restricted to a certain structure for my show anymore. No limitations. I'm free. [...] I {{want to have a}} clear schedule of the dimensions for each venue so that we can properly execute all the technology and visuals.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with TV Guide Anders expressed the same sentiments, responding, [...] "I've watched Rachel struggle. She's always {{trying to do the}} right thing, or thinks she's {{trying to do the right}} thing, and it always gets messed up." [...] Anders also said that this song is [...] "her asking when <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to work out," [...] and commented that it was [...] "emotional" [...] and thought that it would bring people to tears. [...] "Get It Right" [...] and [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] both premiered on On Air with Ryan Seacrest on February25,2011, and were performed in the episode [...] "Original Song", on March15,2011. The song was also released on the iTunes Store in the United States on March15,2011. In the episode performance, Rachel Berry (Michele) appears performing the song with a bedazzled microphone, wearing a blue dress, black belt, and boots, accompanied by Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) and Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) in the background.|$|E
500|$|A {{co-owner}} for Swedish lifestyle magazine Millennium, Blomkvist {{is devoted}} to exposing the corruptions and malfeasance of government, attracting infamy for his tendency to [...] "go too far". Craig competed with Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Viggo Mortensen, and Johnny Depp as candidates for the role. Initial concerns over schedule conflicts with the production of Cowboys & Aliens (2011) and Skyfall (2012) prompted Craig to postpone the casting process. Given the uncertainty surrounding Skyfall following Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's bankruptcy, Sony Pictures Entertainment and DreamWorks worked out a schedule and Craig agreed to take the part. The British actor was required to gain weight and adopted a neutral accent to befit Stockholm's worldly cultural fabric. Having read the book amid its [...] "initial craze", Craig commented, [...] "It's one of those books you just don't put down" [...] There's just this immediate feeling that bad <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to happen and I think that's part of why they've been so readable for people." ...|$|E

500|$|The Economist heralded the book's publication, saying [...] "If {{there is}} no place for Watership Down in children’s bookshops, then children’s {{literature}} is dead." [...] Peter Prescott, senior book reviewer at Newsweek, gave the novel a glowing review: [...] "Adams handles his suspenseful narrative more dextrously than most authors who claim to write adventure novels, but his true achievement lies in the consistent, comprehensible and altogether enchanting civilisation that he has created." [...] Kathleen J. Rothen and Beverly Langston identified the work as one that [...] "subtly speaks to a child", with [...] "engaging characters and fast-paced action [...] make it readable." [...] This echoed Nicholas Tucker's praise for the story's suspense in the New Statesman: [...] "Adams ... has bravely and successfully resurrected the big picaresque adventure story, with moments of such tension that the helplessly involved reader finds himself checking whether <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to work out all right on the next page before daring to finish the preceding one." ...|$|E
500|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the series, fans had expressed dislike towards the character of Duncan. However, he decided to keep playing the character. In a later interview, he said, [...] "Obviously, I acted because I wanted the fans to like the experience. You want your performance to be liked. You don't want to suck. You don't want people to think you suck. That wasn't the goal." [...] Towards the end of the airing of the first season, he stated, [...] "I'm going to be there in every episode next season if we get a second season. So people will either continue to hate me or things will change. <b>Things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to change for Duncan anyway, as the season resolves. There are going to be different sides of him that you're going to get to see." [...] Before going into the filming of season two, Thomas had told Dunn that he was being written off the show, and Dunn did not react badly to the news, as by that point, it [...] "was actually a decision" [...] for him to return for the second season at all.|$|E
500|$|Martin E. Cirulis of Computer Gaming World {{wrote that}} Command & Conquer [...] "remains mainly a good, networkable version of Dune II". Cirulis found the game's {{interface}} intuitive and described its online component as [...] "sophisticated and easy-to-use", also praising its story for being [...] "as interesting as the actual tactics and gunfire", and commented that he [...] "would buy C {{just to see}} where <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to end up". However, according to him, the developers failed [...] "to correct major shortcomings" [...] in Dune II, as its fog of war does not fit with the real-world setting, also finding fault with design choices in the game's missions, which he believed were structured like [...] "puzzles" [...] that allowed for {{only one way to}} win. Nevertheless, he concluded that it remained [...] "the best-looking and sounding strategy game yet" [...] despite its flaws, and that it was [...] "more than entertaining enough to make up for its shortcomings." [...] Writing for PC Gamer US, T. Liam McDonald wrote that the game [...] "has all the playability of Dune II, but with more diverse units, more unusual scenarios, and impressively executed wraparound cutscenes." [...] McDonald called its combat a [...] "satisfying blend of action and strategy", and noted that this, combined with an attention to [...] "little details", made the game a [...] "success", also praising its cutscenes as [...] "terrifically executed". Although he was disappointed that the game lacked [...] "fancier terrain or another zoom level", McDonald concluded: [...] "This game is a whole lot of fun, so get it, play it, and love it like your own child." ...|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2008–09 NHL season, Panthers head coach Peter DeBoer, who first saw Horton play at seven years old, said about his hopes for Horton, [...] "If I'm looking for guys to do more, he wouldn't be at the top of the list. If he can give us 30-plus, I'd be happy with Nathan. There's a group of guys {{underneath}} him that I think can make a lot bigger jumps than I need out of Nathan Horton goal-wise." [...] Horton was also moved from his position of right wing to centre before the season. After playing a few games at centre, Horton said, [...] "It's not as easy as wing. You can play wing and all you have to concentrate on is getting the puck and shooting it. At center, you have more responsibilities." [...] Against the Nashville Predators on November 1, Horton played in his 300th career game, but failed to record a point. On November 26, Horton suffered a deep cut in his leg after it was stepped on by a skate. At the time of the injury, Horton had 6 goals and 7 assists. In early December, the Ottawa Sun reported that the Panthers might have been looking to trade Horton after he was reportedly unhappy playing for the team. Horton returned to the lineup on December 17 after missing eight games. After the game, Horton commented, [...] "I'm excited to play. It's kind of a different Panthers team than the past. It's really changed in a matter of a month. <b>Things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> good now, and everybody's really buying into what Pete has been telling us all year." [...] On January 17, Horton recorded 3 assists to help the Panthers defeat Tampa Bay, 43. For the second time during the season, Horton's name came up in trade rumours, this time with the Chicago Blackhawks. In early March, days after the trade deadline, Horton suffered a finger injury that forced him to have surgery. He returned to the lineup on March 23, recording an assist in a Panthers loss to the Carolina Hurricanes. Horton ended the season with 22 goals and 23 assists in 67 games.|$|E
