That supposition vanishes in a few minutes, as Renner slowly reveals the strength, confidence and unpredictability of a young Russell Crowe. The merging of actor and character is one of <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>things</b> to love about this movie... It's a creepy marvel to watch James in action. He has the cool aplomb, analytical acumen and attention to detail of a great athlete, or a master psychopath, maybe both."Corliss praised the film's [...] "steely calm" [...] tone, reflective of its main character. Corliss summarized, [...] "The Hurt Locker is a near-perfect movie about men in war, men at work. Through sturdy imagery and violent action, it says that even Hell needs heroes." ...|$|E
500|$|Winslet {{has said}} that she is {{interested}} in parts of [...] "angst-ridden women" [...] with strong dispositions masking flaws and insecurities. She connects with [...] "women who are either finding {{their way out of}} a situation, looking for love, having some struggle within love, or questioning <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>things</b> in life". She subconsciously finds herself drawn to parts that are in tandem with her personal struggles at certain points in her life. She finds it difficult to detach herself from her roles, saying that [...] "you have to confront your true feelings every single day. And that’s pretty exhausting. Then you have to go home and make dinner". Even so, she finds it therapeutic to perform. Winslet is known for her willingness to perform nude scenes, having done so in 12 of her films, although she considers its contribution to the narrative before agreeing to it. She believes that these scenes promote a positive body image among women.|$|E
2500|$|Louis Menand in The New Republic {{described}} the sourcing of Goldman's book as [...] "vague and unreliable". [...] Menand wrote of Goldman's book that [...] "The little things don't matter, of course, if <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>things</b> can be trusted. But <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>things</b> can't." [...] Luc Sante, in The New York Review of Books, {{said about the}} account of Lennon's consumption of LSD in the book: [...] "Goldman's background research was either slovenly or nonexistent," [...] {{and that the only}} establishing quote for the LSD story was [...] "from a novel called Groupie (author unidentified)".|$|E

2500|$|Barakat {{said the}} writing process {{consisted}} of Gaskarth [...] "writing songs and us going into the studio to put in our two cents and changing a couple things around." [...] In an interview with Just So You Know, Gaskarth said the album title [...] "summarizes {{the theme of the}} songs, most of which centralize around escapism; running from my problems, burning bridges because of those problems; and the realization that its hard work to rebuild after those problems have torn people apart." [...] In an interview with MTV, Gaskarth said that the title was inspired [...] "by the subject matter on the record, where it's this toss-up of being wrapped up in what we do, and having the fun and the good times, and kind of pulling that blindfold down in order to ignore the fact that other problems are crumbling around you". Gaskarth also said [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>things</b> that came along with this album ... a lot of anxiety. About where were we going to go". Gaskarth said the band purposely sought to [...] "step outside of the box and do some things that were a bit scary." [...] He mentioned that [...] "there's one [...] that starts with classical guitar playing something that sounds like it could be out of vaudeville and it's that kind of thing that we really decided to go for on this record." ...|$|E

Somehow or other, the world has gone amiss with me lately. They won't have me back, my place has been filled up, I can't get any fighting. They've shelved me at the War Office; they talk about a home adjutancy. I can't stick it, I have lived amongst <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>things</b> too long. I'm sick of waiting about, doing nothing--sick to death. I want to get away. There's some work I could do in America. You understand?" ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{thoroughly}} {{enjoyed it}} and the preparation has been great. <b>The</b> <b>big</b> <b>thing</b> {{that came out of}} it was that I played at three Test grounds I'm going to be playing on and got to experience them before this big series coming up. Lord's was my home ground there for Middlesex and I played at The Oval as well and Edgbaston. It couldn't have really worked out any better. <b>The</b> <b>big</b> <b>thing</b> was just going over there to experience the whole different culture really, the weather, the wickets and the bowlers as well." ...|$|R
