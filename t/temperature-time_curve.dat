40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a process and a device for the modification of the local grain structure {{on the surface of}} a material in the solid and liquid phases. The surface of the processing site is heated to a specific temperature by high energy radiation. The temperature arising there is measured. The actual values thus obtained are modified by a control unit by modifying the emission of the high-energy radiation source {{in the direction of the}} desired nominal value. After the heating phase of the material, the <b>temperature-time</b> <b>curve</b> is measured during the cooling phase. The temperature is therefore measured at at least two different points in time on the surface of the material at the site of processing. The control of the <b>temperature-time</b> <b>curve</b> during the remainder of the cooling process takes place by the fact that at least one further exposure of the material to high-energy radiation takes places at the site of processing in such a way that a resulting <b>temperature-time</b> <b>curve</b> request ed in advance is obtained at the site of processing while the material is cooling...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Transcapillary heat {{transfer}} after injections of cold saline {{into the right}} atrium generates bronchial thermodilution curves resembling those observed in the aorta. Under the assumption that no indicator is lost or gained within the pulmonary capillary bed and changes in blood temperature are instantaneously recorded in the bronchial system, we tested the hypothesis that flow rates calculated from bronchial <b>temperature-time</b> <b>curves</b> {{are similar to those}} from aortic curves. Design: Comparative study of two cardiac output estimates in five dogs. Setting: Research laboratory for Experimental Anaesthesiology. Interventions: Cardiac output was decreased (repeated withdrawal of blood) and increased (infusion of colloids or dobutamine) in order to study a wide range of cardiac outputs. Measurements and results: Thermistors were placed in a bronchiole (wedge position) and in the ascending aorta of anaesthetized dogs. Bronchial and aortic thermodilution curves were recorded after injection of 5 mi ice-cord saline into the right atrium. We found that bronchial thermodilution yields flow estimates similar to those from aortic curves. Correlation between the two now estimates was acceptable (r = 0. 84) with a mean difference between the two of less than 2 %. Conclusion: We conclude that the Stewart-Hamilton equation may be extended to bronchial <b>temperature-time</b> <b>curves</b> for estimations of cardiac output. At this time, however, we do not advocate bronchial thermistors as suitable and less invasive alternatives to pulmonary arterial catheters for routine cardiac output measurements in patients...|$|R

Lightweight aggregates from expanded clay are produced by firing of row material up to temperature 1050 °C.

30|$|Subsurface soil {{temperature}} data {{were used to}} calculate two key responses: the average peak temperature reached during the fire {{and the amount of}} lethal heat dosage. For the latter, we plotted the duration (minutes; log-transformed) at or above each temperature that was recorded (to 0.1 ° C) to produce a <b>temperature-time</b> <b>curve</b> for every quadrat. We then compared these curves to a thermal death time (TDT) curve that describes lethality as a function of temperature and duration of heating for insects. Thermal death time curves are lacking for most species, so we used the minimum TDT curve that resulted in 50 % mortality from among the TDT parameters assembled by Rezende et al. (2014) for various life stages of 16 terrestrial insect species from temperate ecosystems. This TDT curve has a slope of 3.9 °C log[min]™ 1 and a y-intercept (time = 1 min) of 41.4 °C, meaning that 50 % mortality would be expected when organisms are subjected to 1 minute at 41.4 ° C, 10 minutes at 37.5 ° C, or 30 minutes at 35.6 ° C. We considered the amount of lethal heat dosage for each quadrat to be the area under the <b>temperature-time</b> <b>curve</b> but above the TDT curve.|$|E

Conduction models were later applied numerically to allow for more realistic time-varying surface heating. Rego and Rigolot (1990) employed a one-dimensional Taylor-Series numerical solution to describe heat transfer through a plant stem. The stem was approximated as a flat semi-infinite slab composed of three layers (bark, cambium and sapwood). Predicted cambium <b>temperature-time</b> <b>curves</b> showed a slightly slower time response than the actual data. Costa et al.

40|$|The current design {{methods used}} to {{determine}} fire progression and temperature-time development in fire compartments today are being questioned to not give accurate results in large and complex enclosures (larger than 500 m 2). The established design methods proposed by Eurocode and used by fire safety engineers today are primarily the standard <b>temperature-time</b> <b>curve</b> and the parametric temperature-time curves. The parametric temperature-time curves {{are based on the}} heat and mass balance equations and both methods assume homogenous temperatures and uniform burning. These assumptions are being questioned for use in large enclosures such as open-plan compartments and compartments with multiple floors connected which are typically modern and common building types in today’s society. Today there are no established design methods developed to determine fire progression in large enclosures, but the Improved Travelling Fire Method (iTFM) and the New MT model II are new, alternative design methods which are prospects to become established engineering tools in the future. The iTFM is developed at the University of Edinburgh for travelling fires in large size compartments and the New MT model II is developed by RISE, Research Institutes of Sweden, for large tunnel fires. These two new design methods have been investigated and compared to established methods in a case study. Also localised fires from Eurocode with proposed interpretations by Ulf Wickström has been investigated and compared to the standard <b>temperature-time</b> <b>curve</b> and the parametric temperature-time curves. The new interpretation suggests that the given heat flux boundary conditions in Eurocode are interpreted as adiabatic surface temperatures based on given emissivities and convection heat transfer coefficients according to Eurocode. Through a case study the different methods were compared throughout reference buildings with constant material properties and fire loads, but with varying floor area and height. The result focused on if the new methods have more bearing on reality than the standard fire curve and the parametric temperature-time curves methods when determining fire progression and temperature-time development. Desired benefits with the new methods are to better predict and describe fire development in large enclosures. The referenceIIIbuildings were considered as occupancy class 2 (Vk 2) and Br 2 buildings with a load bearing fire resistance capacity demand of 30 minutes. This report is an early stage {{in the process of developing}} new fire models to improve the fire designing process when working with large compartments. The aim with the new, alternative methods and localised fires with proposed interpretation is to enable them to become engineering tools used by fire safety engineers in the future to create a more efficient and adapted design process. The results differ significantly depending on used method and reference building. The maximum temperatures conducted by the iTFM are in general higher than the standard fire curve and the parametric temperature-time curves. When applying the method to the reference building with high ceiling height and low spread rate the resulting temperatures were lower than the standard fire curve. The fire progression of the New MT model II is highly dependent on opening factor and time until temperature increase starts. In comparison to the parametric fire curves with the same opening factors the New MT model II resulted in considerably faster temperature development and higher temperatures. Localised fires with the new proposed interpretations resulted in adiabatic surface temperatures which were compared to the standard <b>temperature-time</b> <b>curve</b> after 30 minutes of fire and the maximum temperature of the parametric temperature-time curves. The comparison resulted in slightly lower temperatures for the localised fires with the new proposed interpretations compared to the standard <b>temperature-time</b> <b>curve</b> and similar temperatures compared to the parametric temperature-time curves in the case study. The results of the iTFM and the New MT model II differs significantly depending on physical parameters used in the calculation processes. The models are customizable and vary depending on fire scenarios and compartments and could possibly be future alternative methods when designing for fires in large compartments. Further studies and development together with real fire tests would provide the models with better accuracy and continuity. Localised fires with proposed new interpretations are a future prospect to become a future standard method for determination of maximum temperature of member surfaces in fire safety design...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{research on}} the charring rate of large structural members of timber and the material properties and external factors that influence on the charring of these members. The most commonly used <b>temperature-time</b> <b>curves</b> for large structures, and calculation models for the charring rate of wood, are evaluated and used to establish the documented charring rates. The most important material properties and external factors that influence the charring rate of large timber structures are found by an extensive literature review, and total impact of the properties and factors are listed in tables. However, the change in charring rate due to the various properties and factors is not unambiguous and more systematic research should be carried out to determine rules. An evaluation of calculation models for the charring rate of solid wood, nail-, glue- and cross-laminated structural members was performed and the models giving results closest to test results from the literature were determined. The standard model, EN 1995 - 1 - 2, was only accurate in a few cases. The models that include more of the properties and factors found to influence the charring rate were most accurate. Evaluation of standard and parametric <b>temperature-time</b> <b>curves</b> {{for the design of}} timber structures reveal that the “Swedish” fire and iBMB fire give the best representation of a real fire in a timber structure. The EN 1991 - 1 - 2 Standard fire does not include the contribution to the fire load from the timber structure, and the EN 1991 - 1 - 2 Parametric fire has an unrealistic linear cooling stage. The experimental tests on the charring rate of cross-laminated timber panels show that the calculation models for the charring rate are inaccurate for this type of structural member. The charring rate is affected by the growth rate of the fire and the maximum temperature. High initial growth rates result in higher charring rates. Short fires with steep cooling rate will have a short charring period, while a long fire will reach constant charring rate after a while. Comparing the obtained test results with test results from other researchers gave good matches. The charring rates found during the experimental tests are compared with charring rates found using the calculation models from the literature evaluated earlier in the thesis. As the experiments only resulted in a few measurements for the “Swedish” fire and the EN 1991 - 1 - 2 Parametric fire there was not much to compare with. The char depths for the EN 1991 - 1 - 2 Standard and Parametric fires match well with each other, but the charring rates have a wide scatter. This research has pointed out several issues where knowledge is lacking for fire safe design of large timber structures. The behaviour of exposed timber structures in compartment fires should be studied further, and the influence the timber structure has on the temperature development over time needs more research. This can result in the development of better <b>temperature-time</b> <b>curves</b> for fire exposed timber structures. The models for, calculation of the charring rate given in EN 1995 - 1 - 2 should be improved by introducing more factors and carrying out more {{research on the}} properties and factors that influence the charring rate.   PhD i bygg, anlegg og transportPhD in Civil and Transport Engineerin...|$|R
