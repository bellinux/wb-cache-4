40|$|Institutions {{of higher}} {{learning}} should be doing leadership development of females to enhance the gender balance. The number of females employed in South African higher education is almost equal {{to the number of}} males, yet the highest proportions of females continue to hold the lowest academic and support positions. To compound the problem, after attracting suitable female staff, institutions do not have programmes to encourage them to remain within the system. Females need to surmount extra hurdles to be considered as leaders, and have different experiences of organisations from those of their male peers. Research suggests that women have the qualifications, skills and experiences required for leadership. This study aimed to look at mentoring as a strategy to enhance female leadership development. A literature review was conducted to understand the term mentoring and all related aspects. The aspects included the functions and phases of mentoring, as well as the process of a mentoring programme. Recently organisations have begun to realise how important mentoring can be to their success. Research has shown that mentoring facilitates leadership development through the career and psycho-social functions that the relationship provides. The study also investigated gender and leadership, and highlighted the barriers faced by women. The empirical part {{of this study was to}} determine employees‘ perceptions of mentoring. It was conducted in a Higher Education Institution. Random sampling was used to select respondents. The sample size consisted of 110 respondents. A structured pre-coded questionnaire was used to collect the data. The data was analysed Abstract Page iii using the relevant statistical package.

A cross-sectional survey design was used and recruited 834 patients in a general practice. There were {{statistically significant differences between}} the bookable and the non-bookable appointments for the questions on ‘choice of doctor’, ‘whether able to see the doctor in the time they needed to’, and ‘convenience of the appointment’.

40|$|Patient no-shows for {{scheduled}} {{primary care}} appointments are common.

This paper describes patterns of no-show variation by patient age, gender, appointment age, and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> request for six individual service lines in the United States Veterans Health Administration (VHA). This retrospective observational descriptive project examined 25, 050, 479 VHA appointments contained in individual-level records for eight years (FY 07 -FY 14) for 555, 183 patients. Multifactor analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed, with no-show rate as the dependent variable, and gender, age group, appointment age, new patient status, and service line as factors. The analyses revealed that males had higher no-show rates than females to age 65, at which point males and females exhibited similar rates. The average no-show rates decreased with age until 75 – 79, whereupon rates increased. As appointment age increased, males and new patients had increasing no-show rates. Younger patients are especially prone to no-show as appointment age increases. These findings provide novel information to healthcare practitioners and management scientists to more accurately characterize no-show and attendance rates {{and the impact of}} certain patient factors.

40|$|Allied health {{professionals}} provide a {{diverse range of}} patient care. However funders and purchasers of allied health services have few mechanisms for defining the interventions carried out by allied health providers; for defining episodic care; or for monitoring the quality and outcomes of allied health provider interventions. As a result, third party funders tend to allocate allied health services by establishing a ceiling {{on the number of}} appointments allowed, or “capping care” regardless of the condition or patient need. This paper reports on the effect of the monitoring systems by a third party funder to introduce more patient centred funding models. Aim: To evaluate a system of monitoring allied health service provision, quality and outcomes. Method: A large third party funder piloted the introduction of a comprehensive care planning tool to investigate the potential for post-payment monitoring of service quality. Results: Practitioner perceptions of provider quality were quite different from what was measured and audited. The heterogeneity of allied health services means that no standardised classification system of interventions is appropriate for service benchmarking. There were large variations in service provision, within and between practitioners. Conclusions: Ongoing monitoring should include easily auditable measures, such as occasions of service mapped against broad indicators of <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment.</b> There is a need for ongoing systems of quality improvement to ensure the quality of patient care is optimised...|$|E

METHOD: Patient-representative sample was selected. It consisted of users of the Ophthalmology Outpatient Service at the Hospital das Clínicas, Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP). A structured questionnaire was applied through interview, including the following variables: personal characteristics (gender, age, literacy, job), <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> (new patient, follow-up), waiting time for the first appointment, opinion regarding ease {{of access to the}} hospital, assistance at the front desk, time spent in the waiting room on the appointed day, quality of care, degree of satisfaction with the consultation and general evaluation of the assistance. RESULTS: The sample was characterized by patients with low literacy and socioeconomic level; 21. 7 % had a steady income. The majority of them think that it is easy to obtain an appointment. According to patients, the mean waiting time for the appointment was 94. 6 minutes and 45. 3 % of them received no orientation after the appointment. Final evaluation of the quality of assistance was positive and patients were satisfied with the provided assistance.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore the perspectives of nurse practitioners (NPs) on the barriers and facilitators of ACP. The web-based ACP survey was distributed to the members of the New Hampshire Nurse Practitioner Association (NHNPA). The participants (n = 65) were mostly women (96. 9 %), had a Master’s degree (83. 1 %), and had 16 to 25 years of practice as NPs (37. 5 %).

Whereas the first {{refers to the}} ability to obtain an appointment as soon as possible, the latter warrants a patient being able to see a familiar physician. In this context one has to consider the two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointments</b> - same-day and prescheduled.

What impact does the presence and the location <b>of</b> prescheduled <b>appointments</b> have in this context?
