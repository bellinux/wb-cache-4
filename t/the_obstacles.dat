But Himmler knew that the future of the Waffen-SS was assured; Hitler was already considering invading the Soviet Union.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation is}} made to study <b>the</b> effect of <b>obstacle</b> on <b>the</b> flow structure of air-water two-phase flow through a rectangular enlarging channel. The cross-section of <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> is considered as circular in shape. Effect of the diameter of <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> on <b>the</b> flow structure, pressure fluctuation and pressure distribution is made. Finite volume method (FVM) with mixture model and Eulerian model have been adopted for the present numerical simulation. Simulation results are obtained for both steady and unsteady cases. Due to change in both magnitude and direction of local velocities of fluid as the mixture approaches <b>the</b> <b>obstacle,</b> there is a marked difference in phase distribution around <b>the</b> <b>obstacle.</b> As <b>the</b> size of <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> increases, this becomes more remarkable. It can also be noticed that vortices before and after <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> becomes stronger with increase in size of <b>the</b> <b>obstacle.</b> <b>The</b> pressure difference is also monitored. It is found that as <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> size increases, <b>the</b> pressure drop increases and pressure distribution changes drastically...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} go over a {{vertical}} <b>obstacle</b> face, <b>the</b> front wheels are forced against <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> by <b>the</b> center and rear wheels. The rotation of the front wheel then lifts {{the front of the}} vehicle up and over <b>the</b> <b>obstacle.</b> <b>The</b> middle wheel is then pressed against <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> by <b>the</b> rear wheels and pulled against <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> by <b>the</b> front until it is lifted up and over. Finally, the rear wheel is pulled over <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> by <b>the</b> front two wheels. During each wheel's traversal of <b>the</b> <b>obstacle,</b> forward progress of the vehicle is slowed or completely halted. This is not an issue for the operational speeds at which these vehicles have been operated to date.|$|R
5|$|In both {{navigation}} modes, Air-Cobot is {{also able}} to detect, track, identify and avoid obstacles that are in its way. The laser data from laser range sensors and visual data from the cameras {{can be used for}} detection, monitoring and identification of <b>the</b> <b>obstacles.</b> The detection and monitoring are better in the two-dimensional laser data, while identification is easier in the images from the cameras; the two methods are complementary. Information from laser data can be used to delimit work areas in the image.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the family}} Theraphosidae, which {{includes}} tarantulas and baboon spiders, have urticating hairs on their abdomens and use their legs to flick them at attackers. These hairs are fine setae (bristles) with fragile bases and a row of barbs on the tip. The barbs cause intense irritation {{but there is no}} evidence that they carry any kind of venom. A few defend themselves against wasps by including networks of very robust threads in their webs, giving the spider time to flee while the wasps are struggling with <b>the</b> <b>obstacles.</b> The golden wheeling spider, Carparachne aureoflava, of the Namibian desert escapes parasitic wasps by flipping onto its side and cartwheeling down sand dunes.|$|E
5|$|On 18 March 1948, Jhangar, lost in December 1947 to the Pakistanis, was recaptured by {{troops of}} the Indian Army, which then started to move towards Rajauri from Naushahra sector. On 8 April 1948, the 4th Dogra Battalion {{advanced}} to Rajauri. During the advance, the battalion attacked and captured the Barwali ridge, eleven kilometers {{to the north of}} Naushahra. The battalion's advance beyond Barwali was obstructed by the increasing number of roadblocks and minefields. Supporting tanks were also unable to cross <b>the</b> <b>obstacles.</b>|$|E

We did test a proportional change in the desired velocity as <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> was approached, but this provided little observable effect at great distances and a highly-negative effect closer to <b>the</b> <b>obstacle,</b> as cars were congesting more smoothly but to a greater extent.|$|R
30|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that if <b>the</b> <b>obstacle’s</b> height is {{approximately}} equal to or greater than the walker’s lower leg length, he cannot pass over <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> easily.

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{commissioned}} on 22 November {{and became the}} flagship of Flag Officer Josiah Tattnall, commander of the naval defenses of Georgia. Under pressure from Mallory to engage the blockading ships, Tattnall attempted to engage them before any ironclads arrived on 5 January 1863, but army engineers could not clear <b>the</b> <b>obstacles</b> blocking the channel in a timely manner, despite early coordination being made by Tattnall to do so. It took another month to actually clear <b>the</b> <b>obstacles</b> and two monitors arrived {{before the end of}} January. Nonetheless Tattnall attempted to pass through the obstructions during high tide on 3 February, but high winds prevented the water from rising enough to allow the ship to do so. After Atlanta successfully passed through them on 19 March, Tattnall planned to attack the Union base at Port Royal, South Carolina while the monitors were attacking Charleston. Deserters revealed Tatnall's plan while he was waiting at the head of Wassaw Sound and he was forced to retreat when three monitors augmented the defenses at Port Royal. Dissatisfied with Tattnall's perceived lack of aggressiveness, Mallory replaced Tattnall as commander of the Savannah squadron later that month with Commander Richard L. Page. Page, in his turn was relieved in May by Commander William A. Webb; Atlanta remained the squadron flagship throughout this time.|$|E
5|$|Then, {{following}} {{a degree of}} reconciliation with Charles, Rupert obtained command of the Royalist fleet himself. The intention was to restore Royalist finances by using the remaining vessels of the fleet to conduct a campaign of organised piracy against English shipping across the region. One of <b>the</b> <b>obstacles</b> that this plan faced was the growing strength of the Parliamentary fleet {{and the presence of}} Robert Blake, one of the finest admirals of the period, as Rupert's opponent during the campaign.|$|E

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} numerical {{study of}} Taylor bubble flow in a microchannel (diameter 0. 2 mm) having an obstacle is carried out. A square shaped obstacle, of side 0. 02 mm is placed inside the microchannel. Taylor bubble flow is created using T-junction. Water and air enters through two inlets and form Taylor bubble at <b>the</b> T-junction. <b>The</b> <b>obstacle</b> is placed at an appropriate {{distance from the}} T-junction, where the water and gas fluids are getting mixed, along the downstream such that the stabilized Taylor bubble will touch <b>the</b> <b>obstacle.</b> This shows that <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> will be touched by the Taylor bubble which is already in steady motion. <b>The</b> <b>obstacle</b> position is varied along the perpendicular to the direction of fluid flow. Initially <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> is kept {{at the center of}} the microchannel i. e., it provides an equal space of 0. 9 mm on either of its sides inside the microchannel. As the Taylor bubble touches <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> it splits into two parts and moves through both sides of <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> with a perfect symmetric flow. The bubble joins again and gets to its original form as it passes through <b>the</b> <b>obstacle.</b> Then <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> is moved 0. 02 mm away from the center towards one side, i. e., it provides a gap of 0. 11 mm and 0. 07 mm on either side of <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> respectively. In this case as the Taylor bubble touches <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> it doesn’t split into two parts rather the whole bubble tries to move to the upper side of <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> i. e. maximum area side. Similar phenomenon is observed as <b>the</b> <b>obstacle</b> moves further away from the center line towards one side. The liquid-gas interface is continuously changing its shape due to the disturbance caused by the presence of <b>the</b> <b>obstacle.</b> This creates turbulence inside the liquid plugs present in between the two consecutive bubbles, which is shown by using the velocity vector fields. This may raise hope to enhance more heat and mass transfer in the microchannels by placing multiple <b>obstacles</b> inside <b>the</b> microchannel...|$|R

5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>obstacles,</b> {{readers and}} {{commentators}} {{have reached a}} broad consensus about the book's central cast of characters and, to a lesser degree, its plot, but key details remain elusive. The book discusses, in an unorthodox fashion, the Earwicker family, comprising the father HCE, the mother ALP, {{and their three children}} Shem the Penman, Shaun the Postman, and Issy. Following an unspecified rumour about HCE, the book, in a nonlinear dream narrative, follows his wife's attempts to exonerate him with a letter, his sons' struggle to replace him, Shaun's rise to prominence, and a final monologue by ALP at the break of dawn. The opening line of the book is a sentence fragment which continues from the book's unfinished closing line, making the work a never-ending cycle. Many noted Joycean scholars such as Samuel Beckett and Donald Phillip Verene link this cyclical structure to Giambattista Vico's seminal text La Scienza Nuova ("The New Science"), upon which they argue Finnegans Wake is structured.|$|E
5|$|Early on, {{the player}} {{is given the}} choice between three {{different}} game modes, each with unique cutscenes, puzzles to solve and locations to visit: the Team Path, the Wits Path, and the Fists Path. In the Team Path, protagonist Indiana Jones is joined by his partner Sophia Hapgood who will provide support throughout the game. The Wits Path features an abundance of complex puzzles, while the Fists Path focuses heavily on action sequences and fist fighting, the latter of which is completely optional {{in the other two}} modes. Atypical for LucasArts titles, it is possible for the player character to die at certain points in the game, though dangerous situations were designed to be easily recognizable. A score system, the Indy Quotient Points, keeps track of the puzzles solved, <b>the</b> <b>obstacles</b> overcome and the important objects found.|$|E
5|$|Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book Stories of Resilience in Childhood, {{analyzed}} {{the events in}} Caged Bird to illustrate resiliency in children. Challener states that Angelou's book provides a useful framework for exploring <b>the</b> <b>obstacles</b> many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used Caged Bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He has called the book a highly effective tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.|$|E

5|$|Like the infantry, the {{engineers}} {{had been pushed}} off their targets, and only five of the 16 teams arrived at their assigned locations. Three teams came in {{where there were no}} infantry or armor to cover them. Working under heavy fire, {{the engineers}} set about their task of clearing gaps through the beach obstacles—work made more difficult by loss of equipment, and by infantry passing through or taking cover behind <b>the</b> <b>obstacles</b> they were trying to blow. They also suffered heavy casualties as enemy fire set off the explosives they were working with. Eight men of one team were dragging their pre-loaded rubber boat off the LCM when artillery hit; only one survived the resulting detonation of their supplies. Another team had just finished laying its explosives when the area was struck by mortar fire. The premature explosion of the charges killed or wounded 19 engineers, as well as some nearby infantry. Nevertheless, the engineers succeeded in clearing six gaps, one each at Dog White and Easy Green on the 116th RCT front, the other four at Easy Red on the 16th RCT front. They had suffered casualties of over 40%.|$|E
5|$|Paskevich, who {{observed}} the artillery duel from Fort 55, {{became convinced that}} his Polish counterpart would {{not come to the}} rescue of Fort 56. Initially hesitant, he finally ordered Russian infantry to attack Fort 56 around 10:00. The attack was carried out by 13 infantry battalions (ca. 6,900 men) from columns commanded by General Lüders and Martinov. The forces of Lüders stormed <b>the</b> <b>obstacles</b> and crossed the stockade, but Polish defenders met them with rifle volleys from within the fort, and the attack was repelled. Lüders quickly ordered his second line (2,300 men) to advance as well. The new forces were twice pushed back into the moat by the commander of the northern wing, Maj. Franciszek Biernacki, but in the end the Polish defenders were overpowered and had to withdraw further into the fort. The Russians followed, but their battalions lost cohesion, which allowed the numerically inferior force under Biernacki to hold out inside the fort and cover the flank of the central wing.|$|E
5|$|People {{living in}} areas with high rates of HIV/AIDS face several {{psychological}} barriers when deciding whether to undergo testing for HIV. For example, people may prefer not {{to know if they}} are HIV-positive because, due to <b>the</b> <b>obstacles</b> they often face in gaining access to antiretroviral drugs, many view HIV/AIDS diagnoses as death sentences. Others may simply believe that they are HIV-negative, either because they practice strict monogamy and consistently use condoms during sexual intercourse or because they are in denial about the prevalence of the disease. However, despite these barriers, both mobile and static testing services have become more widely available in Malawi recently: 1,392 testing and counseling sites existed in 2011. Certain non-governmental organization such as the Malawi AIDS Counseling and Resource Organisation (MACRO) provide door-to-door counseling and testing services, which have drastically improved the accessibility of HIV testing.|$|E

5|$|The {{failure of}} the Franco–Belgian forces to hold the Ardennes gap was fatal.

Devoid of any centre of resistance, the German assault engineers had cleared <b>the</b> <b>obstacles</b> unchallenged. The delay that the Belgian Ardennes Light Infantry, {{considered to be an}} elite formation, could have inflicted upon the advancing German armour was proved by the fight for Bodange, where the 1st Panzer Division was held up for a total of eight hours. This battle was a result of a breakdown in communications and ran contrary to the operational intentions of the Belgian Army.|$|E
5|$|Visitation, {{for those}} {{able to make}} the journey, was {{strictly}} controlled by school officials {{in a manner similar to}} the procedures enforced in the prison system.
