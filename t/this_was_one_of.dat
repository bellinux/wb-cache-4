5|$|Broadcasting by National Public Radio in the United States {{followed}} in March 1981 with a repeat broadcast in September. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their first transmissions in stereo.

A German radio version of the first six radio episodes, Per Anhalter ins All was transmitted in 1981 and the twelve original radio episodes have been translated and transmitted in Finland, France, The Netherlands and Sweden.|$|E

5|$|Additional {{concerns}} are hypothyroidism, allergies, epilepsy, diabeties and glandular disorders which may cause baldness. The hair loss occurs at around {{six months of}} age, affecting the neck, thighs and tail; however the frequency has been reduced through work conducted by the breed clubs. Hip dysplasia is seen in around 8.3% of the breed, according to surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals over a twenty five-year period between 1974 and 1999. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the lower results of the sporting breeds, with Greyhounds coming lowest with 3.4%, and the related Boykin Spaniel coming in second highest at 47%. There {{was no evidence of}} elbow dysplasia found. The breed has an average life span of 1013 years.|$|E
5|$|Another {{element of}} the Commonwealth army {{consisted}} of various private armies fielded by the most powerful magnates. In time of peace these consisted of usually small regiments {{of a few hundred}} men, but at their extreme they could number up to 10,000, including cavalry and artillery. In some instances the magnate contribution could surpass that of the main Commonwealth army on the frontlines, although often the magnates preferred to save their troops, as they were not compensated for the state for their contributions. The troops were paid for and equipped by the richest of the noble families, such as the Opaliński, Lubomirski, Potocki, Ossoliński, Zamoyski, Koniecpolski, Sieniawski, Żółkiewski, Sapieha, Chodkiewicz, Pac and Radziwiłł families. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the reasons why the magnates {{played a major role in}} Polish politics, and on occasion, allowed them to engage in bloody civil wars (such as the Lithuanian Civil War in 1700) amongst themselves.|$|E

5|$|At 1:50p.m. CDT (18:50UTC), the SPC {{issued a}} tornado watch for {{northern}} and central Illinois, far northwestern Indiana, far southern Wisconsin, and portions of Lake Michigan. A 60% chance {{of two or}} more tornadoes was assessed across the watch box, with a 40% chance of at least one strong tornado. Isolated shower activity began forming across the region just prior to the issuance of watch, eventually growing into a line of strong to severe thunderstorms, including supercells. One such high-precipitation supercell was first severe warned at 6:11p.m. CDT (23:11UTC); the National Weather Service office in Chicago, Illinois warned of winds up to 70mph (110km/h) and quarter- to golf ball-sized hail. The weather forecast office upgraded the severe thunderstorm warning to a tornado warning at 6:35p.m. CDT (23:35UTC), and four minutes later, trained storm spotters reported a damaging tornado north of Ashton. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> several tornadoes observed across the Central United States on April8 and April9.|$|E
5|$|By a 5–4 margin, {{the justices}} {{reversed}} the conviction, agreeing that Jacobson had been entrapped, on April 6, 1992. It {{has since been}} reported that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the rare cases where the decision changed after arguments. The original poll of the justices showed a 7–2 majority for affirmance, with only White and Stevens holding out. But White argued persuasively for reversal to his fellow Justices, and Blackmun and Clarence Thomas, who had replaced Marshall, changed their minds. It {{has been suggested that}} Thomas, who later established a reputation for allowing wide latitude to law enforcement similar to other contemporary Republican appointees, was especially sensitive at that time to Jacobson's situation due to the sexual harassment allegations raised by Anita Hill during his own recent confirmation hearings.|$|E
5|$|Carlsen won the {{category}} 21 Nanjing Pearl Spring tournament, 2½ points ahead of second-place finisher Topalov, the world's highest-rated player at the time.

By rating performance, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the greatest results in history, with a PR of 3002.

5|$|Coal {{measures}} {{appear in}} the Radstock district, and surrounding Somerset Coalfield (largely concealed by Triassic and newer rocks). There are two series of coal-bearing sandstones and shales separated by Pennant Sandstone. Locally the beds are folded and faulted. There were mines in the Radstock and Nailsea areas but these have closed. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the first areas {{in the world to}} undergo systematic geological study and mapping by John Strachey and William Smith in the 18th century.

5|$|Details of Carol's death were {{revealed}} in the post mortem. There were severe injuries to the skull, and {{it was said that}} her face had been smashed by multiple blows. It was later found in court that the murder weapon had been an ice axe. The body was found to be in a foetal position, which suggested that the body had been dealt with within a few hours of death, before rigor mortis could settle in. It has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that rigor mortis passes in a 24‑to48‑hour time period, and that the body could feasibly have been trussed once rigor mortis had passed. Many unusual knots were used to tie the body, and the same knots were said to be used in Gordon Park's house and boat. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the key pieces of evidence used against Gordon in the trial.|$|E
