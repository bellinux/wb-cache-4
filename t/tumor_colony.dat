40|$|The most {{concerned}} factors for cancer prognosis are tumor invasion and metastasis. The patterns of tumor invasion {{can be characterized}} as random infiltration to surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) or formation of long-range path for collective migration. Recent studies indicate that mechanical force {{plays an important role in}} tumor infiltration and collective migration. However, how <b>tumor</b> <b>colonies</b> develop mechanical interactions with each other to initiate various invasion patterns is unclear. Using a micro-patterning technique, we partition cells into clusters to mimic <b>tumor</b> <b>colonies</b> and quantitatively induce colony-ECM interactions. We find that pre-malignant epithelial cells, in response to concentrations of type I collagen in ECM ([COL]), develop various branching patterns resembling those observed in tumor invasion. In contrast with conventional thought, these patterns require long-range (~ 600 μm) transmission of traction force, but not biochemical factors. At low [COL], cell colonies synergistically develop pairwise and directed branching mimicking the formation of long-range path. By contrast, at high [COL] or high colony density, cell colonies develop random branching and scattering patterns independent of each other.

40|$|The {{emerging}} regulatory role of deubiquitinases (DUBs) {{has been}} implicated in various fundamental processes and pathogenesis. To determine the pivotal role that DUBs play in mediating tumorigenesis, we have performed a non-biased screen of 67 human DUBs based on a mammary cell transformation assay. This led to the identification of USP 11 as a critical determinant of mammary tumor initiation and progression. Using an approach of protein complex purification coupled with mass spectrometry, we further identified XIAP to be a target for USP 11. We demonstrated that, while depletion of XIAP attenuates cell transformation, elevated USP 11 significantly promotes the <b>tumor</b> <b>colony</b> formation through stabilization of XIAP. Molecular modeling coupled with mutagenesis analyses further revealed that Leu 207 on the BIR 2 domain of XIAP facilitates its interaction with USP 11. Stabilization of XIAP due to its deubiquitylation by USP 11 leads to the inhibition of cell anoikis and apoptosis, which in turn promotes tumorigenesis. Finally, immunohistochemical staining revealed that aberrant accumulation of USP 11 correlates with elevated levels of XIAP in breast cancer tissues. We therefore propose that aberrant USP 11, via stabilization of XIAP, promotes tumor initiation and progression...|$|E

40|$|A {{new concept}} in {{multifunctional}} anticancer agents is demonstrated. Tetrakis-(diisopropyl-guanidino) zinc phthalocyanine (Zn-DIGP) exhibits excellent properties as a photodynamic therapy (PDT) agent, {{as well as}} potential anti-metastatic activities in vivo. Zn-DIGP exhibits good cellular uptake and low toxicity in the dark (EC 50 > 80 μM) and is well tolerated upon its intravenous injection into mice at 8 mg/kg. Upon photoexcitation with red laser light (660 nm), Zn-DIGP exhibits a high quantum yield for singlet oxygen formation (Φ ≈ 0. 51) that results in potent phototoxicity to cell cultures (EC 50 ≈ 0. 16 μM). Zn-DIGP is also capable of inhibiting the formation of <b>tumor</b> <b>colonies</b> in the lungs of C 57 BL/ 6 mice injected with B 16 F 10 cells. Zn-DIGP therefore inhibits cancer growth by both light-dependent and light-independent pathways. The anti-metastatic activities of Zn-DIGP possibly result from its ability {{to interfere with the}} signaling between chemokine CXCL 10 and the G protein-coupled receptor CXCR 3. Zn-DIGP is a competitive inhibitor of CXCR 3 activation (IC 50 = 3. 8 μM) and selectively inhibits downstream events such as CXCL 10 -activated cell migration. Consistent with the presence of feedback regulation between CXCR 3 binding and CXCL 10 expression, Zn-DIGP causes overexpression of CXCL 10. Interestingly, Zn-DIGP binds to CXCR 3 without activating the receptor yet is able to cause endocytosis and degradation of this GPCR. To the best of our knowledge, Zn-DIGP is the first PDT agent that can facilitate the photodynamic treatment of primary tumors while simultaneously inhibiting the formation of metastatic <b>tumor</b> <b>colonies</b> by a light-independent mode of action...|$|R

C 57 BL/ 6 male mice were intravenously injected with B 16 melanoma cells (B 16 cell) and were given chow containing 3 % JTT. In subsequent in vivo experiments, we assessed serum cytokine levels and <b>tumor</b> <b>colony</b> formation in the lungs. Additionally, we assessed NK cell activity in ex vivo experiments. Results. JTT significantly suppressed B 16 cell metastasis, whereas injection of anti-asialo-GM 1 antibody into mice abrogated the inhibitory actions of JTT.

Murine peritoneal macrophages incubated with CSF for 48 h inhibited [3 H[thymidine (TdR) incorporation by P 815 tumor cells to approximately 20 % of control values. Inhibition of CSF-stimulated macrophages was significantly greater than inhibition by unstimulated macrophages (P less than 0. 001). CSF had little direct effect on the proliferation of either tumor cells or macrophages alone, indicating that the antitumor activity of CSF was mediated by macrophages. {{it is unlikely that}} impurities in the CSF preparations were responsible for the effect since CSF that had been purified to homogeneity was as active as crude preparations. Furthermore the activity of CSF on macrophages was blocked by addition of purified anti-CSF antibodies. In addition to being tumoristatic, CSF-stimulated macrophages were tumoricidal as determined by a <b>tumor</b> <b>colony</b> growth assay.

Three morphological variants of developing <b>tumor</b> <b>colonies</b> are reported: 1) large light colonies, 2) small dark colonies, and 3) smooth-edged colonies. The large light colony variant is the most frequently observed in the soft agar assay (approximately 70 %), followed by the dark colony variant (approximately 27 %), and the smooth-edged colony variant (approximately 3 %). Major morphological characteristics are associated with each variant, as shown with light microscopy (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both LM and TEM analyses demonstrated that the large light colony variant was hypomelanotic and contained a microfibrillar extracellular matrix (ECM). The small dark colony variant {{was found to be}} hypermelanotic and contained a less demonstrable ECM. The smooth-edged variant has an encapsulated periphery, no demonstrable ECM, and tightly packed cells with desmosome-like junctions. In order to characterize further the ECM in the most commonly observed variant, the large light colony, specific antibodies to fibronectin (FN) and collagen types IV and V (COLs IV and V) were applied and observed with immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoperoxidase.

Our results indicated that the host RNF 13 could inhibit experimental lung metastasis. The absence of host RNF 13 lowered the concentration of GM-CSF in tumor bearing lungs, leading to enhanced invasion of melanoma cells and increased lung colonization.

Accumulating evidence from microarray analyses and animal genetic models highlights the central involvement of the transcription factor early growth response- 1 (EGR- 1) in prostate carcinoma progression. It is unknown, however, whether knockdown of EGR- 1 inhibits IL- 8 production and IL- 8 -mediated tumor metastasis. Here we show that EGR- 1 knockdown by a specific shRNA-Egr 1 inhibited gene transcription and production of IL- 8 by the human prostate cancer cell line DU 145. Conversely, enforced expression of EGR- 1 in EGR- 1 -lacking PC 3 prostate cancer cells markedly enhanced IL- 8 transcription and secretion. By using wild type and a series of mutant IL- 8 promoter luciferase constructs, we found that the NF-κB binding site is important for EGR- 1 regulation of IL- 8. Furthermore, silencing EGR- 1 suppressed a synergistically functional interaction between EGR- 1 and NF-κB. Consequently, knockdown of EGR- 1 inhibited IL- 8 -mediated <b>tumor</b> <b>colony</b> formation and invasion.

The possibility that the enhancement was mediated by inactivation of radiosensitive contaminating lymphocytes was explored. Depletion of T lymphocytes from unirradiated adherent cells by a monoclonal antibody and complement resulted in little overall change in tumour colony growth.

40|$|It {{is unclear}} how proliferating cells elicit {{suppression}} on cell proliferation and how cancer cells evade this growth suppression. Using a loss-of-function screening of the human kinome and phosphatome to identify genes suppressing tumor initiation in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we identified 19 genes and characterized one of the top-scoring tumor suppressor candidates, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type F (PTPRF). We found that PTPRF was induced during cell proliferation by cell-cell contact. Ectopic expression of wild-type PTPRF, but not the phosphatase-inactive mutant, suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation in soft-agar assays. In contrast, PTPRF silencing led to cell hyperproliferation, enhanced <b>tumor</b> <b>colony</b> formation in soft agar, and increased xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. Mechanistically, PTPRF silencing showed aberrant ERK-dependent signaling including the phosphorylation/stabilization of v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC) through the direct activation of v-src avian sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (SRC) and suppression of PP 2 A. This PTPRF-mediated growth suppression during cell proliferation functioned independently of the Hippo-Yap pathway. Clinically, PTPRF was down-regulated in 42 % HCC (37 / 89), 67 % gastric cancer (27 / 40), and 100 % colorectal cancer (40 / 40). PTPRF up-regulation was found in 24 % HCC (21 / 89) and associated with better clinical outcomes.

Two animal groups were studied: Group A consisted of animals bearing small tumors (130 m) and group B consisted of larger tumors (600 m).

40|$|AbstractHuman {{immunodeficiency}} virus type- 1 (HIV- 1) -specific dendritic cell (DC) vaccines {{have been applied}} to clinical trials that show only induction of some degree of immune responses, warranting the search of other more efficient vaccine strategies. Since HIV- 1 -specific CD 8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) {{have been found to}} recognize some HIV- 1 structural protein Gag conserved and cross-strain epitopes, Gag {{has become one of the}} most attractive target candidates for HIV- 1 vaccine development. In this study, we generated HIV- 1 Gag-specific Gag-Texo vaccine by using ConA-stimulated polyclonal CD 8 + T-cells with uptake of Gag-expressing adenoviral vector AdVGag-transfected DC (DCGag) -released exosomes (EXOs), and assessed its stimulation of Gag-specific CD 8 + CTL responses and antitumor immunity. We demonstrate that Gag-Texo and DCGag vaccines comparably stimulate Gag-specific effector CD 8 + CTL responses. Gag-Texo-stimulated CTL responses result in protective immunity against Gag-expressing BL 6 - 10 Gag melanoma in 8 / 8 wild-type C 57 BL/ 6 mice. In addition, we show that Gag-Texo vaccine also induces CTL responses leading to protective and long-term immunity against Gag/HLA-A 2 -expressing BL 6 - 10 Gag/A 2 melanoma in 8 / 8 and 2 / 8 transgenic HLA-A 2 mice, respectively. The average number of lung <b>tumor</b> <b>colonies</b> in mice with 30 -days post-immunization is only 23, which is significantly less than that (> 300) in control ConA-T-immunized HLA-A 2 mice. Furthermore, Gag-Texo vaccine also induces some degree of therapeutic immunity. The average number (50) and size (0. 23 mm in diameter) of lung <b>tumor</b> <b>colonies</b> in Gag-Texo-immunized HLA-A 2 mice bearing 6 -day-established lung BL 6 - 10 Gag/A 2 melanoma metastasis are significantly less than the average number (> 300) and size (1. 02 mm in diameter) in control ConA-T-immunized HLA-A 2 mice. Taken together, HIV- 1 Gag-Texo vaccine capable of stimulating Gag-specific CTL responses and therapeutic immunity may be useful as a new immunotherapeutic vaccine for viral control in HIV- 1 patients...|$|R
40|$|Berberine, an {{isoquinoline}} alkaloid {{derived from}} plants, {{is a traditional}} medicine for treating bacterial diarrhea and intestinal parasite infections. Although berberine has recently been shown to suppress growth of several tumor cell lines, information regarding the effect of berberine on colon tumor growth is limited. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the effects of berberine on regulating the fate of colon tumor cells, specifically the immorto Min mouse colonic epithelial (IMCE) cells carrying the Apcmin mutation, and of normal colon epithelial cells, namely young adult mouse colon (YAMC) epithelial cells. Berberine decreased colon <b>tumor</b> <b>colony</b> formation in agar, and induced cell death and LDH release in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in IMCE cells. In contrast, YAMC cells were not sensitive to berberine-induced cell death. Berberine did not stimulate caspase activation, and PARP cleavage and berberine-induced cell death were not affected by a caspase inhibitor in IMCE cells. Rather, berberine stimulated a caspase-independent cell death mediator, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) release from mitochondria and nuclear translocation in a ROS production-dependent manner. Amelioration of berberine-stimulated ROS production or suppression of AIF expression blocked berberine-induced cell death and LDH release in IMCE cells. Furthermore, two targets of ROS production in cells, cathepsin B release from lysosomes and PARP activation were induced by berberine. Blockage of either of these pathways decreased berberine-induced AIF activation and cell death in IMCE cells. Thus, berberine-stimulated ROS production leads to cathepsin B release and PARP activation-dependent AIF activation, resulting in caspase-independent cell death in colon tumor cells. Notably, normal colon epithelial cells are less susceptible to berberine-induced cell death, which suggests the specific inhibitory effects of berberine on colon tumor cell growth...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{allogeneic}} versus syngeneic killer cells derived from normal or {{severe combined immunodeficiency}} disease (SCID) mice was evaluated for induction of antitumor reaction in a murine model of mammary carcinoma. Tumor cells of H- 2 d origin were injected intravenously into H- 2 d/b mice 24 hours after total body irradiation (4 Gy). On the following day, lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) splenocytes, derived from either minor (H- 2 d) or major (H- 2 b) histocompatibility complex (MHC) -mismatched parental normal mice or MHC (H- 2 b) -mismatched SCID mice, were given intravenously. LAK cells of H- 2 d normal or SCID mice, syngeneic to the tumor, were inoculated in parallel. The results show that LAK cells derived from minor histocompatibility complex-mismatched or MHC-mismatched parental normal mice improved the probability of tumor-free survival as compared with LAK cells syngeneic to the tumor cells, but they aggravated the severity of graft-versus-host disease. SCID splenocytes serving {{as a source of}} natural killer (NK) cells were expanded and activated in vitro by rIL- 2 to obtain a sufficient number of DX 5 + CD 3 − CD 8 − NK cells (SCID-LAK). H- 2 b SCID-LAK cells did not cause graft-versus-host disease and significantly delayed tumor growth compared with syngeneic H- 2 d SCID-LAK cells, as indicated by <b>tumor</b> <b>colony</b> assays in vitro and adoptive transfer experiments. However, the graft-versus-tumor effect was not long lasting, and treated mice finally died of tumor. Our results show an advantage of allogeneic over syngeneic cell therapy for achieving a graft-versus-tumor effect by rIL- 2 -activated T cells and NK cells. Periodic repetition of NK treatments may be required to achieve more durable antitumor effects...|$|E
40|$|Two {{peptides}} {{derived from}} the C 1 B domain of protein kinase Cγ (PKCγ) were shown to associate with classical PKC isozymes and modulate their activities. These C 1 B peptides are designated C 1 B 1 (amino acid residues 101 - 112) and C 1 B 5 (residues 141 - 151). Since PKC enzyme activity is shown {{to be involved in}} colon cancer development, the effect of C 1 B peptides on the growth of various human colon cancer cell lines was examined in vitro and in vivo. Sub-micromolar to micromolar levels of both C 1 B peptides induced approximately 60 - 70 % growth attenuation in multiple colon cancer cell lines in a soft agar <b>tumor</b> <b>colony</b> assay; however, C 1 B 5 peptide was not cytotoxic to normal colon epithelial cells in two dimensional culture. The effect of C 1 B 5 peptide on colony growth of COLO 205 cells was reversed by treatment with the PKCα/β inhibitor, Ro- 32 - 0432. C 1 B peptide treatment attenuated COLO 205 cells via two mechanisms: 1) cell cycle arrest and 2) stimulation of apoptosis. This is evident in G[subscript ⁯ 2] arrest and increases in levels of cleaved caspase 3 and p 53 phosphorylated at serine 20. Intratumoral injection of C 1 B 5 peptide (20 mg/kg/day, every three days) markedly attenuated the growth of subcutaneous xenografts of COLO 205 cells in SCID mice by 76 % compared to the control. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that C 1 B peptides have negligible effects on normal tissues but are potentially effective chemotherapeutic agents for colon cancer...|$|E
40|$|Why does hormone {{replacement}} therapy (HRT) with estrogens plus progestins {{increase the risk of}} breast cancer? First, experimental estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and progesterone receptor-positive (PR+) human breast cancers contain a rare subpopulation of ER−, PR− cancer stem cells. Especially in small, nascent ER+, PR+ <b>tumor</b> <b>colonies,</b> progestins, but not estrogens, reactivate cells with ER−, PR− stem-like properties. Second, there is a reservoir of occult, undetected, preinvasive breast cancer in some women who are candidates for HRT. We propose that women who develop breast cancer while on estrogens plus progestins harbor undiagnosed nascent disease before the start of therapy. The progestin component, in a nonproliferative step, reactivates receptor-negative cancer stem cells within such germinal, perhaps even dormant tumors. After reacquiring receptors, these tumor cells are expanded by the mitogenic properties of estrogens. We argue that screening methods need to be improved to detect small, preexisting malignancies {{prior to the start of}} HRT. Women harboring such disease should be excluded from regimens that include systemic progestins...|$|R
40|$|The {{pattern of}} in vitro anchorage-independent growth of tumor {{cells from the}} murine UV- 2237 {{fibrosarcoma}} correlated with their ability to produce experimental metastasis in vivo. When seeded into 0. 3 % Noble agar semisolid medium, cells of metastatic clones developed into larger <b>tumor</b> <b>colonies</b> {{at a faster rate}} than did cells of clones with low metastatic potential. Furthermore, when tumor cells were plated into 0. 6 % Noble agar, colony development by cells of low metastatic potential clones was almost completely restricted. Tumor cells from the heterogeneous parent UV- 2237 fibrosarcoma were plated into dishes containing 0. 6 % agar semisolid medium. In separate experiments, 16 colonies were isolated 2 weeks thereafter and were established as individual cell lines in monolayer cultures. All of these cell lines produced experimental metastases as determined by in vivo lung colony assay. The data suggest that anchorage-independent growth of UV- 2237 tumor cells in 0. 6 % Noble agar semisolid medium is selective and permits the isolation of metastatic subpopulations...|$|R
40|$|Ablation of <b>tumor</b> <b>colonies</b> {{was seen}} in a wide {{spectrum}} of human carcinoma cells in culture after treatment with the combination of β-lapachone and taxol, two low molecular mass compounds. They synergistically induced death of cultured ovarian, breast, prostate, melanoma, lung, colon, and pancreatic cancer cells. This synergism is schedule dependent; namely, taxol must be added either simultaneously or after β-lapachone. This combination therapy has unusually potent antitumor activity against human ovarian and prostate tumor prexenografted in mice. There is little host toxicity. Cells can commit to apoptosis at cell-cycle checkpoints, a mechanism that eliminates defective cells to ensure the integrity of the genome. We hypothesize that when cells are treated simultaneously with drugs activating more than one different cell-cycle checkpoint, the production of conflicting regulatory signaling molecules induces apoptosis in cancer cells. β-Lapachone causes cell-cycle delays in late G 1 and S phase, and taxol arrests cells at G 2 /M. Cells treated with both drugs were delayed at multiple checkpoints before committing to apoptosis. Our findings suggest an avenue for developing anticancer therapy by exploiting apoptosis-prone “collisions” at cell-cycle checkpoints...|$|R
