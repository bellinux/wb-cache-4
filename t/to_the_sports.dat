5|$|In 2008, {{the city}} council in Oslo decided to upgrade the Holmenkollen Line to metro standard, to allow six-car MX3000 trains {{to be the main}} mode of {{transport}} to Holmenkollen Ski Jump during the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011. This will allow 9,000people per hour to be transported <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> venue. The first T1000 was scrapped on 14 March 2007, and the last T1000 train was run on 19 July 2009. Oslo Tramway Museum has preserved six T1000 cars, no. 1002 (T1-2), 1018 (T1-2), 1076 (T1-1), 1092 (T2), 1129 (T3) and 1141 (T4). In 2008, the T2000 were taken out of service while the Holmenkollen Line was being renovated. In 2010, Ruten decided that they would not put back into service, largely because of high maintenance costs and low availability of spare parts because of the technically complex design and small series. The last T1300 was retired on 22 May 2010, after which only MX3000 units are used on the metro.|$|E
5|$|In January 2008, an {{addition}} 15 units were ordered by Oslo, with {{an option for}} further orders later. This will allow all the eastern lines to have a 7.5-minute headway on their services into the city center, instead of the current 15-minute headway. Trains would start using the balloon loop located at Stortinget, and the western lines {{will continue to have}} a 15-minute headway. At the same time, the trains serving the Ring Line will be extended to six cars. The order cost NOK675 million. In addition, Akershus finalized their order for five units, costing NOK240 million. Unlike the Oslo-owned units, Akershus' five units will be owned by the transit authority Ruter. The same year, the city council in Oslo decided to upgrade the Holmenkoll Line to metro standard, to allow six-car MX3000 trains to be the main mode of transport to Holmenkollen during the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011. This allowed 9,000people per hour to be transported <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> venue. In 2009, the T2000 units were taken out of service, and on 22 April 2010 the last T1300 was taken out of service, making the MX3000 the only units to be used on the Oslo Metro. The city council was considering ordering 15 additional MX3000 to replace the T2000, as an alternative for a NOK50-million renovation.|$|E
5|$|In October 2009, Mike Ashley {{announced}} {{that he planned to}} lease the name of the ground in a bid to increase revenue, and in November the stadium was temporarily renamed sportsdirect.com @ St James' Park Stadium. This name was only supposed to be used {{until the end of the}} 2009–10 season, but lasted until November 2011. On 10 November 2011, the club officially changed the name of the stadium <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sports</b> Direct Arena, although this will most likely be an interim name, as it is only being used to showcase the sponsorship capabilities of the stadium. The company, owned by Ashley, were not paying anything for the deal. However, if another company purchases the naming rights, they will be expected to pay between £8 million and £10 million. Many fans voiced their anger at the renaming, but Managing Director Derek Llambias has said that it was necessary to give Newcastle extra money so that they compete with the bigger clubs in the league.|$|E
