In this paper, we attempt to describe the problems and challenges <b>of</b> <b>argument</b> <b>mining</b> from a machine learning angle. In particular, we advocate that machine learning techniques {{so far have been}} under-exploited, and that a more proper standardization of the problem, also with regards to the underlying argument model, could provide a crucial element to develop better systems...|$|R

We test our method on the CorEA corpus of user comments to online newspaper articles, evaluating our system's performances in assigning the correct relation, i. e., support or attack, to pairs <b>of</b> <b>arguments.</b> We obtain results consistently better than a sentiment analysis-based baseline (over two out three correctly classified pairs), and we observe that sentiment and lexical semantics are the most informative features {{with respect to the}} relation prediction task...|$|R

However, to extract richer information {{from such a}} sentence as “His decision was right, ” not only the predicate “was right ” but also the noun “decision ” need to be identi ed as an event denoting expression.

Some event-nouns, such as ryouri “cook/cuisine”, do not always refer to an event, and word sense disambiguation of event-nouns {{has to be done}} depending on their context. In this paper, we present an unsupervised machine learning method to extract patterns of event-nouns for event-hood determination.

SRL is crucial to information extraction, question answering, and machine translation. When applied to patent text, existing tools for SRL have unsatisfying performance because of long sentences. To improve performance in patent SRL systems, this study separates each sentence in patent abstracts into a simpler structure, and then labels semantic roles for the simplified sentence. At last, semantic information and semantic framework for frequently used words are used to extract patent knowledge. Our work demonstrates that the method used in this article can improve the performance in SRL system and obtain beneficial knowledge from patents...|$|R

40|$|Enthymeme reconstruction, i. e. the <b>task</b> <b>of</b> reformulating <b>arguments</b> with missing propositions, is an {{exciting}} task at the borderline of text understanding and argument interpretation. However, there is some doubt in the community about the feasibility <b>of</b> this <b>task</b> due to {{the wide range of}} possible reformulations that are open to humans. We therefore believe that research on how to define an objective ground truth for these tasks is necessary before any work on the automatic reconstruction can begin. Here, we present a feasibility study for the <b>task</b> <b>of</b> finding and expanding enthymemes involving a fortiori arguments in real-world texts, and we show that given a sufficiently strict reformulation of the human annotation task, substantial agreement can be achieved. We split the task into three sub-tasks: 1. deciding whether a candidate text span really represents an enthymematic argument, 2. classifying the type <b>of</b> a fortiori <b>argument</b> concerned and 3. describing the missing premise in natural language. In a case study involving the two authors of this paper as annotators, we test a specific type <b>of</b> a fortiori <b>arguments,</b> the let alone construction, for its suitability for reaching high agreement in all three stages <b>of</b> the <b>task.</b> We also discuss pragmatic effects of let alone and how they relate to argumentation theory...|$|R

One can then get anthropic estimates for the masses, sizes, luminosities, times, velocities, etc. for many other structures in physics and astronomy, from atoms to giraffes to the universe, as simple powers of the anthropic estimate for the elementary charge. For example, one gets an anthropic estimate for the real part of the logarithm of the dark energy density with a relative error of only 0. 2 %.

We have, peculiar to the prose writer, the <b>task</b> <b>of</b> keeping his phrases large, rhythmical and pleasing to the ear, without ever allowing them {{to fall into the}} strictly metrical: peculiar to the versifier, the <b>task</b> <b>of</b> combining and contrasting his double, treble, and quadruple pattern, feet and groups, logic and metre--harmonious in diversity: common to both, the <b>task</b> <b>of</b> artfully combining the prime elements of language into phrases that shall be musical in the mouth; the <b>task</b> <b>of</b> weaving their <b>argument</b> into a texture of committed phrases and of rounded periods--but this particularly binding in the case of prose: and, again common to both, the <b>task</b> <b>of</b> choosing apt, explicit, and communicative words. We begin to see now what an intricate affair is any perfect passage; how many faculties, whether of taste or pure reason, must be held upon the stretch to make it; and why, when it is made, it should afford us so complete a pleasure. From the arrangement of according letters, which is altogether arabesque and sensual, up to the architecture of the elegant and pregnant sentence, which is a vigorous act of the pure intellect, there is scarce a faculty in man but has been exercised. We need not wonder, then, if perfect sentences are rare, and perfect pages rarer.|$|R
