50|$|Drum hoists {{require less}} routine {{maintenance}} than a friction hoist, because the haulage cable is {{fixed to the}} drum, and therefore have less downtime, and the maintenance regime is less sophisticated. Drum hoists can continue to operate if the shaft bottom gets flooded and less shaft depth is required below the loading pocket, unlike friction hoists where such flooding could cover the <b>tail</b> <b>ropes</b> and so on. Because drum hoists do not have <b>tail</b> <b>ropes,</b> the hoisting system is more suited to slinging beneath a conveyance.|$|R
50|$|Balanced {{friction}} hoists are {{not suitable}} for hoisting from multiple loading pockets on different horizons within a shaft, and are generally {{not suitable for}} deep shafts. Friction hoists can not operate at normal speeds if the shaft bottom is flooded and water reaches the <b>tail</b> <b>ropes.</b>|$|R

He made a rough guess at the strength of its pull, and loaded the sledge accordingly. Two <b>tail</b> <b>ropes</b> were fastened to the last bar of the sledge for the men to hold on by and check its speed. A sort of anchor was made by which it could be stopped at any moment, and two stout poles, with iron claws at the end of them, were prepared for scraping over the snow and checking the pace.|$|R
50|$|There were steep {{gradients}} on the line; from Seghill to Prospect Hill {{rising as}} steep as 1 in 61, and from Prospect Hill to the Tyne falling gradients, the steepest {{of which was}} 1 in 25. The line was worked mainly by stationary engines, one at Prospect Hill, near the Allotment, which hauled up the loaded wagons from Holywell, and the empty wagons from the Newcastle and North Shields road. The other engine was at Percy Main, hauling the empty wagons from the staiths. From Prospect Hill to Percy Main and from Percy Main to the staiths the loaded wagons ran by gravity, unwinding as they descended a <b>tail</b> <b>rope</b> from the drum of the engine, to bring hack the empty wagons. The remainder of the line from Seghill to Holywell was worked by locomotives; those used at first were the Samson and the John, both built by Timothy Hackworth.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the coal}} was removed, it was transported {{underground}} from the South Hills to industries along the Monongahela river. The [...] "coal road" [...] passed under three hills, under Mount Oliver, Pennsylvania, then a trestle over a ravine {{at the present}} location of Parkwood Road, then under the hill topped by Fort Jones, later St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church and St. Clair Village, then over another ravine at the present-day Wagner Street, to re-enter an underground mine section in Carrick near where Bruner Street is today. This mine connected with the [...] narrow gauge line of the Bausman Mine in Spiketown, now Carrick, and was still operational in 1899. Coal was transferred from Spiketown to the mine entrance on St. Patrick Street by a <b>tail</b> <b>rope</b> system, which was later replaced by a steam locomotive that ran underground. The coal from the mine {{was transferred to the}} Birmingham Coal Railroad, a [...] narrow gauge railroad that ran down the middle of South 21st Street from an inclined plane railroad. Although the incline is no longer in existence, its site is occupied by South Side Park, which was also a location of a Sankey brick works. When the enginehouse of the coal road burned shortly before the expiration of Keeling's lease on the mine, the lease was not renewed; At about the same time, the Pittsburgh and Whitehall Railroad obtained an easement adjacent to the track in the center of South 21st St.|$|E

Michael raced up the ladder and tried to close their gap. Bronte then made it up to the <b>tail</b> <b>rope,</b> and tried to untie it without a glove on, but once she untied it, she dropped her glove. Michael soon got level with Bronte, but {{as he was about to}} untie his tail, he made a big slip. Bronte went to untie the bit of the tail while taking her other glove off, but dropped that as well. Just as Bronte was making her last climb towards the finish, Michael tried to untie his last bit of the tail. There was no {{stopping}} Bronte however as she got her way past the line andwon it for Claw. Claw had escaped from Scorpion Island. Michael didn't give up however and edged his way up to the finish line for Sting. The rest of Claw were so happy for Bronte but showed sportsmanship for Sting as well. A helicopter arrived on the island to pick up Claw and take them home. Both teams also reflected on their on the island and how it changed them. The spirits of the powers in the Arena of the Powers had then become released, and the members of Sting were set in stone to replace them. Claw on the other hand celebrated their win and stopped off at a public beach to have fun.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare anaesthetic recoveries without assistance (group NA) to a head and tail rope-assisted technique (group A) after emergency abdominal surgery in horses. Additionally, possible risk factors for the quality of recovery (S: safe, NS: non-safe) were investigated and possible complications associated to the head and <b>tail</b> <b>rope</b> technique recorded. For that purpose 200 anaesthetic protocols (100 NA, 100 A) from horses that all received a standardised medetomidine-isoflurane balanced anaesthesia regime and medetomidine in combination with morphine for recovery were analysed retrospectively. No significant difference regarding recovery score was detected between NA and A horses. Fatalitalities (3 / 100 in each group) were similarly distributed between groups. However, in group NA only one horse died because of trauma during recovery. The other two horses died before attempting to stand up. All 3 horses that died in group A were euthanized because of trauma. Hypoxemia (defined as arterial oxygen partial pressure < 60 mmHg) during anaesthesia was a risk factor for non-safe recoveries. No influence was detected for age, weight, duration of general anaesthesia, reason of colic surgery, recovery technique (A, NA), hypotension during anaesthesia, time in lateral recumbency, time in sternal recumbency and time until standing. Several technical complications (material fail, twisting of ropes, halters slipping off and loss of ropes) were observed using the head and tail ropes, probably being partially responsible for the unexpectedly high number of dangerous and fatal recoveries observed in group A. The present study could not demonstrate that the head and <b>tail</b> <b>rope</b> technique can reduce fatalities or improve anaesthetic recovery scores after emergency abdominal surgery in horses. Hypoxemia during general anaesthesia increases the risk of non-safe recovery...|$|E
40|$|Belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) {{have been}} {{identified}} as Arctic ecosystem sentinels because they are broadly dispersed, high trophic feeders and are likely to be negatively impacted by climate change. They are highly dependent on hearing and underwater sound to enact key biological activities such as forage for prey, communicate with conspecifics and navigate. Therefore, understanding how noise might affect their sensory ecology is a priority to encourage their survival and address the broader potential acoustic impacts within the Arctic. Ocean noise levels are increasing in the Arctic due to an increase in human activities, which are related to the interests in Arctic resources and the opening of the Northwest Passage. This is of concern because several beluga populations are endangered and considered strategic stocks. Their hearing sensitivities are unknown. The work presented here describes for the first time how wild belugas hear. OBJECTIVE To describe the hearing sensitivity of temporarily restrained Bristol Bay belugas using auditory evoked potential (AEP) techniques for the range 4 - 180 kHz in the shortest time possible. METHODS 1) Solitary belugas were captured using a 300 -ft. long net, 15 -ft deep with 21 in. mesh deployed from an 18 ft. aluminum skiff with a 70 hp outboard assisted by an additional two to four support boats.

5000|$|Friction (or Koepe) hoists are {{the most}} common type of hoist used in Europe, Asia and Australia. [...] The {{friction}} hoist was invented in 1877 by Frederick Koepe. [...] Friction hoists are mounted on the ground above the mine shaft, or at the top of the headframe. Friction hoists utilize <b>tail</b> <b>ropes</b> and counterweights and do not have the haulage rope fixed to the wheel, but instead passed around it. The tailropes and weights offset the need for the motor to overcome the weight of the conveyance and hoisting rope, thereby reducing the required horsepower of the hoisting motor by up to 30%, with the overall power consumption remaining the same. Friction hoists, unlike drum hoists, can and normally do use multiple ropes giving them a larger payload capacity, however since they require a larger safety factor, they are impractical for very deep shafts.|$|R

60|$|Browning's {{conception}} of the Universe can hardly be better expressed than in the old and pregnant fable about the five blind men who went to visit an elephant. One of them seized its trunk, and asserted that an elephant {{was a kind of}} serpent; another embraced its leg, and was ready to die for the belief that an elephant was a kind of tree. In the same way to the man who leaned against its side it was a wall; to the man who had hold of its <b>tail</b> a <b>rope,</b> and to the man who ran upon its tusk a particularly unpleasant kind of spear. This, as I have said, is the whole theology and philosophy of Browning. But he differs from the psychological decadents and impressionists in this important point, that he thinks that although the blind men found out very little about the elephant, the elephant was an elephant, and was there all the time. The blind men formed mistaken theories because an elephant is a thing with a very curious shape. And Browning firmly believed that the Universe was a thing with a very curious shape indeed. No blind poet could even imagine an elephant without experience, and no man, however great and wise, could dream of God and not die. But there is a vital distinction between the mystical view of Browning, that the blind men are misled {{because there is so much}} for them to learn, and the purely impressionist and agnostic view of the modern poet, that the blind men were misled because there was nothing for them to learn. To the impressionist artist of our time we are not blind men groping after an elephant and naming it a tree or a serpent. We are maniacs, isolated in separate cells, and dreaming of trees and serpents without reason and without result.|$|R
50|$|A leg rope or leash is a {{urethane}} cord {{attached to}} {{the deck of a}} surfboard, down near the <b>tail.</b> A leg <b>rope</b> plug enables the leg rope to be attached here using a leg rope string. The other end of the leg rope is secured tightly around the surfer's ankle with a velcro fastening strap covered in neoprene to provide comfort for the user. The purpose of using a leg rope is to keep the surfboard attached to a surfer's ankle at a safe distance. Should the surfer fall whilst riding a wave, the surfboard will not be swept away, thus allowing the surfer to quickly recover his surfboard and return to the take-off zone. The leg rope was invented in the 1970s amidst controversy that it was a dangerous accessory. Initially, a minority of people expressed concern that if a surfer fell whilst riding a wave and wearing a leg rope, the surfboard may bounce back and hit the surfer causing serious injury. Although this can happen, most surfers today choose to use a leg rope whilst surfing as it is believed that leg ropes prevent more accidents than they cause.|$|R
