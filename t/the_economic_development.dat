40|$|Education is very {{important}} issue in İslam to develop a Muslim individual who should well learn the İslam for living his life according to İslamic rules. This order is also important in <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> life. A Muslim individual should concern halal and haram and avoid derivation an improper personal benefit. Erbakan mentions this subject with <b>the</b> ethical <b>economic</b> <b>development.</b> According to Erbakan, <b>the</b> ethical <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> is that a Muslim indivudial should act according economic laws of İslam. Erbakan also states that the material development cannot actualise without <b>the</b> ethical <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> for which <b>the</b> number of quran courses, İslamic institutes and imam hatip school should increase to educate Muslims İslamically. Thus, an economic system could constuct through which Muslims can acquire İslamic mind, avoid harams and derivation an improper personal benefit, give infaq and sadaqah.

The closure to traffic also enabled a significant repair programme to be undertaken, in part funded by the Welsh Government and the European Union.

A portion of sales tax revenues is set aside for this, some going into the Grand Forks Growth Fund. Companies can request low-interest loans or grants from this fund provided they meet certain criteria, such as paying a relatively high wage and doing most of their business outside the city's trade region. The city also contributes to the Grand Forks Region Economic Development Corporation (EDC), a public-private organization that receives funding from banks and other major businesses. The EDC plays a consulting role for businesses, such as identifying suitable sites for expansion or assembling public funding packages. Its other key role is to vet businesses {{to see if they}} are suitable for funding by the Growth Fund.|$|E
5|$|The {{state and}} federal governments also had {{conflicts}} on the economic front. UMNO leaders feared that the economic dominance of Singapore would inevitably shift political power away from Kuala Lumpur. Despite earlier agreement to establish a common market, Singapore continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of Malaysia. In retaliation, Singapore refused to provide Sabah and Sarawak {{the full extent of the}} loans previously agreed to for <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> of the two eastern states. The Bank of China branch of Singapore was closed by the Central Government in Kuala Lumpur as it was suspected of funding communists. The situation escalated to such an extent that talks between UMNO and the PAP broke down, and abusive speeches and writings became rife on both sides. UMNO extremists called for the arrest of Lee Kuan Yew.|$|E
5|$|After Napoleon's total {{defeat in}} 1815, the Congress of Vienna merged the French {{territory}} in Belgium with the Netherlands {{to form the}} United Kingdom of the Netherlands as a buffer state against the French. It was ruled by William I of Orange. The synergy of combining the manufacturing centers in Belgium with the important exporting ports in the Netherlands encouraged growth of the industrial cloth manufacturing and metallurgic centers in Wallonia. Keen to promote <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> of the southern provinces as well, William I founded the Société Générale des Pays-Bas in 1822 to provide businesses with capital to invest in machinery. The Société Générale served as a driving force behind Belgian industrialization in the 19th century, and at its height controlled large swathes of the national economy. William I also encouraged the creation of educational facilities in the Southern Provinces, founding the State University of Leuven, the University of Liège and Ghent University in 1817.|$|E

Despite a scandal surrounding donations he had received from Texan businessman Robert Stafford, Joseph was selected to contest the seat of St Mary's North in the 2004 Antiguan general election, in which the ALP lost power, being replaced in government by the United Progressive Party (UPP) led by Baldwin Spencer. Joseph himself lost his seat, but was elected Chairman of the ALP a year later, and regained the seat in 2009 with a majority of 21. The same year, he was arrested for participating in an unauthorised May Day rally protesting the UPP administration; after a lengthy trial, he and several other ALP members were convicted and fined.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Development</b> Board {{had been}} set up in 1961 to {{formulate}} and implement national economic strategies, focusing on promoting Singapore's manufacturing sector. Industrial estates were set up, especially in Jurong, and foreign investment was attracted to the country with tax incentives. The industrialization transformed the manufacturing sector to one that produced higher value-added goods and achieved greater revenue. The service industry also grew at this time, driven by demand for services by ships calling at the port and increasing commerce. This progress helped to alleviate the unemployment crisis. Singapore also attracted big oil companies like Shell and Esso to establish oil refineries in Singapore which, by the mid-1970s, became the third largest oil-refining centre in the world. The government invested heavily in an education system that adopted English as the language of instruction and emphasised practical training to develop a competent workforce well suited for the industry.|$|E
5|$|Under Rau's {{leadership}} the DWK, {{still under}} {{supervision of the}} Soviet Military Administration in Germany (German: Sowjetische Militäradministration in Deutschland or SMAD), quickly developed more and more into a partner of the SMAD with its own conceptions and intentions. This policy was also endorsed by the Soviet chief diplomat in Germany, Vladimir Semyonov, the future Chief Commissar of the USSR in Germany, who already in January 1948 correspondingly stated, that SMAD orders, (which accompanied DWK orders,) should have merely the purpose to back {{the authority of the}} German orders. One of Rau's aims during the meetings with the SMAD was, to come to agreements, which also obliged the Soviet side, including subordinate Soviet authorities, who still engaged in wild confiscations for reparation purposes. An important success in this direction was a half-year plan for <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> {{in the second half of}} 1948, which was accepted by the SMAD in May 1948.

5|$|Although {{there was}} an {{improving}} system of roads in early modern Scotland, it remained a country divided by topography, particularly between the Highlands and Islands and the Lowlands. Most of <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> was in the Lowlands, which saw the beginnings of industrialisation, agricultural improvement {{and the expansion of}} eastern burghs, particularly Glasgow, as trade routes to the Americas opened up. The local laird emerged as a key figure and the heads of names and clans in the Borders and Highlands declined in importance. There was a population expanding {{towards the end of the}} period and increasing urbanisation. Social tensions were evident in witch trials and the creation of a system of poor laws. Despite the aggrandisement of the crown and the increase in forms of taxation, revenues remained inadequate. The Privy Council and Parliament remained central to government, with changing compositions and importance before the Act of Union in 1707 saw their abolition. The growth of local government saw introduction of Justices of the Peace and Commissioners of Supply, while the law saw the increasing importance of royal authority and professionalisation. The expansion of parish schools and reform of universities heralded the beginnings of an intellectual flowering in the Enlightenment. There was also a flowering of Scottish literature before the loss of the court as a centre of patronage at the beginning of the seventeenth century. The tradition of church music was fundamentally changed by the Reformation, with the loss of complex polyphonic music for a new tradition of metrical psalms singing. In architecture, royal building was strongly influenced by Renaissance styles, while the houses of the great lairds adopted a hybrid form known as Scots baronial and after the Restoration was influenced by Palladian and Baroque styles. In church architecture a distinctive plain style based on a 'T'-plan emerged. The Reformation also had a major impact on art, with a loss of church patronage leading to a tradition of painted ceilings and walls and the beginnings of a tradition of portraiture and landscape painting.|$|E
