5|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of the game in Spain, modifications <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> rules have appeared regionally, creating variations.

5|$|Finally, Putnam's {{internal}} realism {{has been}} accused by Curtis Brown of being a disguised form of subjective idealism. If this is the case, it is subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> arguments against that position. In particular, it falls {{into the trap of}} solipsism. That is, if existence depends on experience, as subjective idealism maintains, and if one's consciousness were to stop existing, then the rest of the universe would stop existing as well.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s, {{molecular}} biology was increasingly {{seen as a}} threat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> core of evolutionary biology. Established evolutionary biologists—particularly Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, and George Gaylord Simpson, three of {{the architects of the}} modern synthesis—were extremely skeptical of molecular approaches, especially {{when it came to the}} connection (or lack thereof) to natural selection. The molecular-clock hypothesis and the neutral theory were particularly controversial, spawning the neutralist-selectionist debate over the relative importance of mutation, drift and selection, which continued into the 1980s without a clear resolution.|$|E
5|$|His {{father had}} him crowned king in 1057 or 1058. Solomon's {{coronation}} was a fundamental condition of his engagement to Judith, a sister of Henry IV, King of Germany. Their engagement {{put an end}} to the more than ten-year-long period of armed conflicts between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire. However, Solomon's coronation provoked his uncle, Béla, who had until that time held a strong claim to succeed his brother Andrew according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> principle of seniority. Béla had, since around 1048, administered the so-called ducatus or duchy, which encompassed one-third of the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In April 1999, Sullivan {{scholars}} Bruce I. Miller and Helga J. Perry {{announced that}} they had discovered a nearly complete orchestration – lacking only the second violin part – in a private collection of early band parts. These materials, with a conjectural reconstruction of the partially lost vocal lines and second violin part, were later published and professionally recorded. This piece has now been performed {{a number of times}} by amateur and professional companies, although it has not become a standard addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> scores or recordings.|$|E

5|$|Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days was {{released}} for the Nintendo DS in Japan on May 30, 2009. It is primarily set between Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II, focusing on Roxas' time in Organization XIII and his motives for leaving. It {{is the first}} game in the series to feature cooperative multiplayer in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> use of AI-controlled partners. Gameplay is mission-based with optional objectives that yield additional rewards. The game also has a unique panel system which governs character improvement, special abilities, and equipped weapons.|$|E
5|$|Real-world {{historical}} {{designs were}} also adapted for the fictional world. Flying battleships of the Anatoray and Disith nations included components of Japanese dreadnoughts in commission {{at the turn}} of the twentieth century. Uniform designs for Anatoray's musketeers were based on Napoleon Bonaparte's army and American Civil War soldiers. On the other hand, Soviet Red Army fur coats provided the basis for Disith uniforms. Another inspiration for creators came from a silent film of the airship Hindenburg, which depicted the aircraft's UFO-like silver-plated design in contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> buildings below. This imagery was reproduced in the series.|$|E
5|$|Research by Matthew Baron, David B. Norman, and Paul M. Barrett in 2017 {{suggested}} a radical revision of dinosaurian systematics. Phylogenetic analysis by Baron et al. recovered the Ornithischia as being {{closer to the}} Theropoda than the Sauropodomorpha, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> union of theropods with sauropodomorphs. They resurrected the clade Ornithoscelida {{to refer to the}} group containing Ornithischia and Theropoda. Dinosauria itself was re-defined as the last common ancestor of Triceratops horridus, Passer domesticus, Diplodocus carnegii, and all of its descendants, to ensure that sauropods and kin remain included as dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|The Bahá'í {{calendar}} {{is based}} upon the calendar established by the Báb. The year consists of 19 months, each having 19 days, with four or five intercalary days, to make a full solar year. The Bahá'í New Year corresponds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> Persian New Year, called Naw Rúz, and occurs on the vernal equinox, near 21 March, {{at the end of the}} month of fasting. Bahá'í communities gather at the beginning of each month at a meeting called a Feast for worship, consultation and socializing.|$|E
5|$|The Echo {{moved from}} Bridge Street to a {{purpose-built}} newspaper office at Echo House, Pennywell Industrial Estate, in 1976. The move brought an end <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> methods of printing using hot molten metal to produce type and printing plates, and introduced computer technology. The £4million development saw the Echo {{become the first}} daily newspaper in the North East to be completely produced by photo-composition and web-offset printing. It also saw {{a change in the}} Echos appearance, with a new shape, bolder typefaces and clearer printing. The first new-look Echo was printed at Pennywell on 26 April 1976 and was issue number 32,512.|$|E

5|$|The Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky {{reaction}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as the Corey–Chaykovsky reaction or CCR) is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of epoxides, aziridines, and cyclopropanes. It was discovered in 1961 by A. William Johnson and developed significantly by E. J. Corey and Michael Chaykovsky. The reaction involves addition of a sulfur ylide to a ketone, aldehyde, imine, or enone to produce the corresponding 3-membered ring. The reaction is diastereoselective favoring trans substitution in the product regardless of the initial stereochemistry. The synthesis of epoxides via this method serves as an important retrosynthetic alternative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> epoxidation reactions of olefins.|$|E
5|$|The {{athletics}} {{competition at}} the first Olympics featured a men's long jump competition and a women's competition was introduced at the 1948 Summer Olympics. Professional long jumpers typically have strong acceleration and sprinting abilities. However, athletes must also have a consistent stride {{to allow them to}} take off near the board while still maintaining their maximum speed. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> long jump, a standing long jump contest exists which requires that athletes leap from a static position without a run-up. A men's version of this event featured on the Olympic programme from 1900 to 1912.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulty}} in acquiring Masters badges {{has made the}} tournament {{one of the largest}} events on the secondary-ticket market. A majority of the badges for the Masters are delivered to the same group of patrons, fans, and members each year, and these perennial ticket holders sometimes decide to sell their badges through large ticket marketplaces such as StubHub, TicketCity, and VividSeats. Some of these marketplaces will allow fans to purchase a Masters badge for a single day, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> 4-day pass.|$|E
