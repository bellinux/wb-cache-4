50|$|SCRIBE is a {{decentralized}} publish/subscribe {{system that}} uses Pastry for its underlying route management and host lookup. Users create topics to which other users can subscribe. Once <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> has been created, {{the owner of}} <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> can publish new entries under <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> which will be distributed in a multicast tree {{to all of the}} SCRIBE nodes that have subscribed to <b>the</b> <b>topic.</b> <b>The</b> system works by computing the hash of <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> name concatenated with the name of the user who owns <b>the</b> <b>topic.</b> This hash is then used as a Pastry key, and the publisher then routes packets to the nodeclosest to the key using Pastry's routing protocol to create the root node of <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> on that node. People then subscribe to <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> by computing <b>the</b> key from <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> and publisher's name and then using Pastry to route a subscribe message to <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> towards <b>the</b> root node. When the root node receives the subscribe message from another node it adds the node ID to its list of children and begins acting as a forwarder of <b>the</b> <b>topic.</b>|$|R

5|$|Ancient Athens, of the 6th century BC, was {{the busy}} trade centre at the {{confluence}} of Egyptian, Mesopotamian and Minoan cultures {{at the height of}} Greek colonisation of the Mediterranean. The philosophical thought of this period ranged freely through many subjects. Empedocles (490430 BC) foreshadowed Darwinian evolutionary theory in a crude formulation of the mutability of species and natural selection. The physician Hippocrates (460370 BC) avoided the prevailing superstition of his day and approached healing by close observation and the test of experience. At this time a genuine non-anthropocentric curiosity about plants emerged. The major works written about plants extended beyond the description of their medicinal uses to <b>the</b> <b>topics</b> of plant geography, morphology, physiology, nutrition, growth and reproduction.|$|E
40|$|Topic Maps {{are used}} for {{structuring}} contents and knowledge provided from different information sources and different languages. They are defined as semantic structures which allow organizing all the subjects they represent. They are intended to enhance navigation and improve information search in these resources. In this paper, we propose to study <b>the</b> quality of <b>Topic</b> Maps. Topic Map quality covers various aspects, {{some of them are}} common with conceptual schemas, others are common with information retrieval systems and some other aspects are specific to <b>the</b> problem of <b>Topic</b> Maps. In this paper, we have limited our work to treat the aspect of quality related to the volume of <b>the</b> <b>Topic</b> Map. In fact, Topic Maps are usually very big and voluminous, since they can contain thousands of Topics and associations. This large volume of information and complexity can lead to a bad organization of <b>the</b> <b>Topic</b> Map, so searching information using <b>the</b> <b>Topic</b> Map structure will be a very difficult task and users cannot find easily what they want. In this context, to manage the volume of <b>the</b> <b>Topic</b> Map, we propose a dynamic pruning method when we display <b>the</b> <b>Topic</b> Map by defining a list of meta-properties associated to each <b>topic.</b> <b>The</b> first meta-property represents <b>the</b> <b>Topic</b> score which reflects its relevance over the time and the second meta-property indicates the level to which belongs <b>the</b> <b>Topic</b> in <b>the</b> <b>Topic</b> Map...|$|R

5|$|Beyond architecture, Burges {{designed}} metalwork, sculpture, jewellery, {{furniture and}} stained glass. Art Applied to Industry, {{a series of}} lectures he gave to the Society of Arts in 1864, illustrates the breadth of his interests; <b>the</b> <b>topics</b> covered including glass, pottery, brass and iron, gold and silver, furniture, the weaver's art and external architectural decoration. For most of the century following his death, Victorian architecture was neither the subject of intensive study nor sympathetic attention and Burges's work was largely ignored. However the revival of interest in Victorian art, architecture, and design in the later twentieth century {{has led to a}} renewed appreciation of Burges and his work.|$|E

50|$|A study {{conducted}} by Lana (1961) demonstrates a moderating effect of the familiarity of information presented on order effects. In <b>the</b> study, a <b>topic</b> of initial low familiarity was used. Then, the researchers presented a long talk to well familiarize one group with <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> and a short talk to another group to gain little familiarization with <b>the</b> <b>topic.</b> A third group was then presented with no familiarization talk. Each of these three groups was then split into two subgroups, which listened to arguments for and against <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> twelve days later. One subgroup would listen to the argument for <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> first and then the argument against <b>the</b> <b>topic,</b> and <b>the</b> second subgroup would listen to the argument against it first. These groups then filled out a Likert Scale questionnaire on their opinions on <b>the</b> <b>topic.</b> <b>The</b> results show that prior familiarization with a <b>topic</b> increased <b>the</b> likelihood of a primacy effect. Therefore, those in the long familiarization group had an opinion on <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> that coincided with which argument they heard first, regardless of the actual stance. However, no prior familiarization led to a recency effect to be demonstrated. Therefore, the group that was given no familiarization talk demonstrated opinions that coincided with the argument presented last to them.|$|R

Farah estimated that approximately 60 per cent of the militia were Darod, 30 per cent were Hawiye, and the remaining 10 per cent were from other clans; the majority of security forces in Mogadishu were Darod. He said that the TFG had not sought to exclude Darod from the militia, and attributed the imbalance to Hawiye having primarily supported the Council of Islamic Courts (CIC).|$|E

40|$|The {{community}} and <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> can help summarize the text-augmented social networks. Existing works mixed up the {{community and}} <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> by regarding them as the same. However, there is an inherent difference between {{the community and}} <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> such that considering them as the same is not so flexible. We propose a mutual enhanced infinite (MEI) community–topic model to detect communities and topics simultaneously in text-augmented social networks. The community and <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> are correlated via a community–topic distribution. The mutual enhancement effect between the community and <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> is validated by introducing two novel measures perplexity with community (perplexityc) and mean of the rank (MRK) with topic (MRKt). To determine the numbers of communities and <b>topics</b> automatically, <b>the</b> Dirichlet Process Mixture (DPM) model and the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process mixture (HDP) model are used to model the community and <b>the</b> <b>topic,</b> respectively. We further introduce parameters to model {{the weight of the}} community and <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> responsible for community inference. Experiments on the co-author network built from a subset of DBLP data show that MEI outperforms the baseline models in terms of the generalization performance. Parameter study shows that MEI is averagely improved by 3. 7 and 15. 5 % in perplexityc and MRKt, respectively, by setting a low weight for <b>the</b> <b>topic.</b> We also experimentally validate that MEI can determine the appropriate numbers of communities and topics...|$|R
