2500|$|Like the Model <b>T</b> <b>car,</b> a Fordson tractor {{that was}} {{relatively}} new and well maintained would start easily in warm weather. Under such conditions, often a single crank pull would start it. However, in cold weather, starting could be difficult, especially once the machines were 10, 20, or 30 {{years old and}} worn out. In cold weather, the oil congealed on the cylinder walls and on the clutch plates. The engine had to be hand cranked repeatedly with great effort. [...] Strong men took turns cranking between intervals when individual ignition coils were adjusted. [...] Sometimes farmers would build a fire under the tractor to warm up the crankcase and gear boxes to make it crank easier. [...] The tractor, when in use, was fueled by kerosene, but gasoline was required to start it.|$|E
