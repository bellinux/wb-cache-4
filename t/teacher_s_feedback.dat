40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{relationship}} between causal attribution beliefs of students and their self-esteem. The sample of the study comprised of 3614 students including 1868 male and 1746 female students studying in the 10 th grade from 72 public sector schools across 6 districts (selected on the geographical basis) of Punjab. The data were collected by using two research instruments. A 5 -point rating scale, Causal Attribution Beliefs Scale (CABS) was used to measure causal attributions beliefs of students. Eight attributes were included in the instrument i. e. ability, effort, strategy, interest, luck, task difficulty, parent. s influence and teacher. s influence. Another instrument, a 5 -point rating scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) was used to measure self-esteem of the students. According to the nature of the data and to address the research questions, different statistical techniques i. e. inferential statistics like Independent Sample t-Tests, MANOVA, Pearson Product-Moment Correlations were applied. The results of the study revealed that students endorsed all given causes (ability, effort, strategy, interest, luck, task difficulty, parent. s influence and teacher. s influence) as a potential cause of both success and failure. Identical patterns of success were observed in mathematics and English. Both girls and boys ranked teacher. s influence, effort and parent. s influence as their prime causes of success in mathematics. Both male students and female students believe teacher. s influence, effort, parent influence and ability as the primary causes of their success in English. However, there were significant differences in failure attribution patterns. Male students consider lack of effort, lack of interest and wrong use of strategy as the main causes of their failure in mathematics. Whereas, female students considered lack of effort, wrong use of strategy and task difficulty as major causes of their failure in mathematics. In the same way, male students. main causes of failure in English were ranked as lack of interest, lack of effort and wrong use of strategy. While female students ranked failure causes in English as lack of effort, task difficulty and wrong use of strategy. Majority of the students showed high self-esteem levels. Only 14 % of the male students and 10 % of the female students exhibited low self-esteem level. Gender difference was found in self-esteem. Girls showed higher self-esteem level than boys. Similarly, urban students showed higher self-esteem level than rural students and science students showed higher self-esteem level than arts students. Relationship between causal attribution beliefs of students and self-esteem was found at secondary level. A small, negative but significant correlation was found in failure attributions and self-esteem level of the students. The relationship between failure attributions in mathematics and self-esteem was found in three attributions i. e. ability, luck and parent. s influence: whereas the relationship between failure attributions in English and self-esteem was found in five attributions i. e. ability, strategy, luck, parent. s influence and teacher. s influence. A small but positive correlation was found between success attributions and self-esteem level of the students. As far as success attributions in mathematics and self-esteem were concerned, four attributions i. e. ability, effort, interest and parent. s influence were positively correlated. Similarly, relationship between success attributions in English and self-esteem was found in six attributions i. e. ability, effort, strategy, interest, parent. s influence and teacher. s influence. Attributional patterns are changeable and can be taught to the students. The teachers should encourage their students to the attributions of controllable causes, so that changed self-perception brings academic improvement. The <b>teacher.</b> <b>s</b> <b>feedback</b> is very important in changing students. attributional beliefs. They must be trained in approaching their students, motivating them intrinsically and provision of suitable oral / written feedback to them so that in result students. desire to learn, to discover, to comprehend, to develop etc, can be flourished...|$|E

This paper reports on an explorative study in two schools on teachers Eexperiences in multicultural classes followed by an in-depth case study of one expert teacher in a multicultural classroom. We use this study to answer the question to what degree this teacher displays interpersonal competencies (teaching behaviours, knowledge and attitudes) specific for teaching in multicultural classrooms by comparing this <b>teacher</b> <b>s</b> competence with generic interpersonal teaching competence. The teacher studied seems to be aware of special needs of students from different cultures and to use this knowledge to apply specific teaching strategies and interpersonal cues to create a positive classroom atmosphere and to cater for needs of diverse students.

40|$|Abstract Current uses of robots in {{classrooms}} are reviewed {{and used to}} characterise four scenarios: (s 1) Robot as Classroom Teacher; (s 2) Robot as Companion and Peer; (s 3) Robot as Care-eliciting Companion; and (s 4) Telepresence Robot Teacher. The main ethical concerns associated with robot teachers are identified as: privacy; attachment, deception, and loss of human contact; and control and accountability. These are {{discussed in terms of}} the four identified scenarios. It is argued that classroom robots are likely to impact children’s’ privacy, especially when they masquerade as their friends and companions, when sensors are used to measure children’s responses, and when records are kept. Social robots designed to appear as if they understand and care for humans necessarily involve some deception (itself a complex notion), and could increase the risk of reduced human contact. Children could form attachments to robot companions (s 2 and s 3), or robot <b>teachers</b> (<b>s</b> 1) and this could have a deleterious effect on their social development. There are also concerns about the ability, and use of robots to control or make decisions about children’s behaviour in the classroom. It is concluded that there are good reasons not to welcome fully fledged robot <b>teachers</b> (<b>s</b> 1), and that robot companions (s 2 and 3) should be given a cautious welcome at best. The limited circumstances in which robots could be used in the classroom to improve the human condition by offering otherwise unavailable educational experiences are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — An electro-tactile {{display is}} a tactile {{interface}} composed of skin surface electrodes. The {{use of such}} a device {{is limited by the}} variability of the elicited sensation. One possible solution to this problem is to monitor skin electrical impedance. Previous studies revealed a correlation between impedance and threshold, but did not construct real-time feedback loops. In this study, an electro-tactile display was constructed using a 1. 45 <b>s</b> <b>feedback</b> loop. Real-time pulse width modulation was proposed, and the relationship between skin resistance and absolute threshold was measured to find a function for determining a suitable pulse width from skin resistance. An evaluation experiment revealed that the proposed algorithm suppressed spatial variation and reduced temporal change.

Assim, discute o descompasso entre a Formação Continuada e os resultados em sala de aula, na qual o que foi proposto não acontece. Busca, nas raízes do trato educativo, a trajetória percorrida pelos professores, desde a fase de sua formação inicial até o presente momento. Pontua a Formação Continuada, tentando identificar como é recebida pelos professores. Oportuniza uma discussão que contrapõe teoria e prática, a partir do posicionamento dos professores relativamente à Formação Continuada. Os apoios teóricos focam prioritariamente significado, sentido e, complementarmente, a identidade do professor. Com o alicerce das entrevistas, esta pesquisa levanta categorias, concernentes às inquietações quanto à práxis dos docentes, em decorrência dos cursos de Formação Continuada, analisadas e discutidas à luz dos fundamentos propostos por Ciampa, Nóvoa e outros. A pesquisa é qualitativa, utilizando as entrevistas pessoa a pessoa como o instrumento de coleta de dados. Objetiva desvelar o ponto de vista de três professoras no quadro de cursistas participantes em Cursos de Formação Continuada, por mais de uma década, para localizar possíveis entraves, avanços e retrocessos em sua prática e a possibilidade de relação disso com a Formação Continuada vivenciada.

In this sense, it questions the out of the measure observed between the Continuity Training and the results in the classroom, where all the proposed actions do not happen. It also searches, in the deep essence of education, the way performed by the teachers, since their initial training until the actual moment. This work also highlights the Continuity Training, trying to identify how it is absorbed by the teachers and it also gives opportunity to the discussions between theory and practice, from the angle of the teachers actions towards the Continuity Training. Theoretical support essentially focuses on meaning, sense and, in a complementary side, the <b>teacher</b> <b>s</b> identity.
