When police went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>motel</b> {{to check the}} register, they discovered that at 8:26p.m. CT that evening, Puentes Pizaña and Ramón Palomares, another hitman of the Cuellar organization, checked in with the receptionist. She registered the car in her notebook as a white Grand Marquis, but it was unclear if she wrote 821-WEX or 821-THE7 as the license plate number. Other evidence showed that several calls were made from Puentes Pizaña's and Garza's rooms to an identical Dallas number {{on the day of}} the murder. The police were never able to connect the number with the investigation, or identify the Dallas contact. Other evidence showed that Garza, along with Cuellar and Moya, visited a gun shop in Dallas to purchase a [...]38 Super pistol. After Fischer was killed, Garza said that the gun was stolen from his house in San Antonio after someone broke into it. The weapon was never recovered.|$|E
