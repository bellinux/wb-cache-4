40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to propose}} a tax reform that would reduce income taxes and other {{indirect}} taxes {{while at the same}} time increasing inheritance and estate taxes. Such a reform is economically very efficient and would certainly equalize income distribution. Design/methodology/approach – A wide review of the death and inheritance taxes in the USA and Europe is presented. Findings – Government's revenue from inheritance and gifts is lower than 1 percent of GDP. This is due mainly to a combination of considerable <b>tax-free</b> <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> the closest relatives and high thresholds where the top rates apply. No empirical examination of the effect of inheritance tax on economic growth or economic efficiency could be found. Practical implications – Because inheritance taxes are economically efficient, they improve the immoral unequal income distribution drastically. Therefore, it should be concluded that inheritance tax must be implemented. Originality/value – This paper discusses the various economic aspects of the proposed tax reform.

A flexible retirement age after 62 years was introduced (1972) for invalids and handicapped persons, and social assistance was extended to those who previously had to be helped by their relatives. From 1971, special subventions were provided to enable young farmers to quit farming “and facilitate their entry into the non-agricultural pension system by means of back payments.” ...|$|R

At the same time, more elaborated apps are being developed for offline use. For example, Google is planning to offer new offline features that will allow navigating around a city in offline mode. Moreover, through Google’s new context-aware service, Now on Tap, tourists will be able to build a temporary offline library with all relevant data and information they would need for a day, for example of where they want to travel and what they are planning to visit. The data download can be completed while the mobile device is connected to free Wi-Fi, for example at the airport, accommodation and other Wi-Fi zones and hotspots and thus, expensive internet fees can be avoided [24]. According to Tripadvisor [34], 74  % of global travellers surveyed regarded free in-room Wi-Fi as the most influential amenity when booking accommodation. Furthermore, 87  % of global travellers use mobile devices while travelling, with 61  % of global travellers using social media while on holidays [33].

Dies w nach Berechnung des DIW Berlin Familien mit Kindern durchschnittlich um rund 700 Euro pro Jahr entlasten. Die Entlastung steigt mit dem Einkommen. Im untersten Zehntel (Dezil) der Einkommensverteilung betr 4 gt die durchschnittliche Entlastung der Familien knapp 300 Euro pro Jahr, w 4 hrend sie im obersten Zehntel rund 840 Euro ausmacht. Familien mit geringen Einkommen werden also unterdurchschnittlich entlastet. Insgesamt kostet die Reform mehr als sieben Milliarden Euro pro Jahr. Im Zusammenhang mit der Familienbesteuerung wird h 4 ufig das franz 6 sische Familiensplitting als Vorbild genannt. In dieser Studie werden der deutsche Familienleistungsausgleich sowie der Reformvorschlag der Union als Varianten eines Familienrealsplittings in Art und Wirkung mit dem tariflichen Familiensplitting in Frankreich verglichen. Es zeigt sich, dass schon das bestehende deutsche Modell in weiten Teilen gro ist als das franz 6 sische. Die finanziellen Vorteile f deutsche Familien w sich bei Umsetzung der Unionspl 4 ne vergr 6. Generell haben alle Splittingmodelle den gravierenden Nachteil, dass sie dem familienpolitischen Ziel der Vereinbarkeit von Beruf und Familie entgegenwirken. Angesichts der hohen fiskalischen Kosten des Unionsvorschlags sollte deswegen in Erw 4 gung gezogen werden, die Mittel eher in Ma zu investieren, die einen solchen Zielkonflikt nicht aufweisen, wie zum Beispiel den Ausbau qualitativ hochwertiger Kinderbetreuung. As part {{of their}} {{election}} manifesto, under the heading 'family income splitting', the German Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CDU/CSU) has proposed increasing child benefits by 35 euros per month and raising the <b>tax-free</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> dependent children to {{the same level as}} the basic personal tax exemption for adults. According to calculations by DIW Berlin, if this proposal were to be implemented, families with children would be around 700 euros a year better off, on average. The higher the family's income, the more tax relief they would receive. Families in the lowest income decile only stand to gain an average of just under 300 euros per year, while those in the upper decile will be approximately 840 euros per year better off. Consequently, tax relief for low-income families is below average and yet, the total cost of the reform is more than seven billion euros per annum. In the context of family taxation, the French family income splitting system is frequently cited as a model. The present study outlines the German family allowance system and also the reform proposed by the CDU/CSU as examples of 'real' family income splitting (Familienrealsplitting) and compares them, in terms of their structure and impact, with the French system of 'notional' family income splitting (tarifliches Familiensplitting). The analysis reveals that the current German model is already, to a great extent, more generous than the French one. Should they be implemented, the CDU/CSU plans would further increase the financial benefits already provided to German families under the current system. However, it is generally the case that all income splitting models have the serious disadvantage of undermining the important family policy goal of enabling a reconciliation of work and family life. Given the high fiscal costs of the CDU/CSU proposal, serious consideration should be given to investing the additional funds in other family policy measures that do not present conflicts of interest, such as expanding high-quality child care options, for example...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{based on}} German and French micro data {{shows that the}} redistributive effects of family support provided {{in the form of}} tax relief are stronger in Germany than in France. This is true both for redistribution between households of different sizes and for redistribution between households with different incomes. The average burden on single individuals without children compared to other types of household is larger in Germany than in France. Couples with one, two, or three children bear a comparatively lower burden in Germany than in France. For couples with four or more children, the relative income-tax burden is the same in the two countries. Overall, all German households with children bear a below-average share of the income-tax burden, while in France this applies only to lone parents and to couples with three or more children. In France, therefore, there is a greater degree of redistribution than in Germany from households consisting of couples with one or two children to households that have three or more children. The study also revealed differences in the redistributive effects related to the amount of household income. In all households with children, the burden is much lower (or the relief obtained is much higher) in the bottom five deciles in Germany than in France. Only couples with children who are in the top two deciles (or in the top three deciles in the case of couples with three children) enjoy greater relief under the French system than their counterparts in Germany. For a long time, family policy has been more of a peripheral question in the political debate in Germany, but issues relating to family policy have recently been gaining increasing priority. One important reason is the fact that family policy in Germany - despite the substantial amount of public funds spent on it compared to other countries - performs less well with respect to a range of indicators than the family policy of other European countries. Indicators that deserve particular mention in this respect are the low birthrate and the low share of working mothers. Contributors to the public debate often cite France, whose income-tax system and supply of state-funded child-care facilities are believed to be particularly supportive of families. France is seen {{as an example of a}} country with a 'successful family policy' because both its fertility rate and the share of working mothers in its labor force are higher than in Germany and, in particular, because childlessness is less common there amongst highly qualified women than in Germany. 4 French family policy differs from German family policy in many respects, ranging from the supply of subsidized child-care facilities and the design of the regulations on parental leave benefits to the family policy components of the income-tax system. 5 The focal point of this report is a comparison between the redistributive effects engendered in Germany and France by the different tax treatment of families with children. The German instruments concerned are child benefits (Kindergeld) and the <b>tax-free</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> dependent children (Kinderfreibetrag); the French measures are the 'family splitting' procedure in the calculation of income tax and family allowances (Allocations Familiales). If a comparison of the relief provided by these measures is to yield useful information, then it must, on principle, also take account of the empirical income distribution and of the different definitions of taxable income. This is particularly important in the context of a Franco-German comparison because there are some substantial differences in the definitions of taxable income used in the two countries. Having compared the tax treatment of families in France and Germany, the results of the empirical analysis of the effective average tax burden or amount of tax relief will then be presented; the analysis is based on the year 2001 because more recent data are not yet available for France. ...|$|R
