5|$|With Queensland's {{resources}} already strained by {{an ongoing}} severe drought, the Commonwealth Government of Australia agreed to evenly split {{the cost of}} restoring government assets damaged by Ada; this expenditure would normally fall to the state alone. By August 1970, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> governments had issued a combined $708,000 in grants for repairing flood damage in Bowen. The name Ada was later retired from the Australian tropical cyclone naming list due to the cyclone's severe impact.|$|E
5|$|Forced {{to choose}} between {{accepting}} depreciated money in payment for outstanding debts or waiting long times to collect debts, creditors turned to the courts for relief. In 1822, Bourbon County circuit court judge James Clark ruled {{in the case of}} Williams v. Blair that the replevin law violated <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> constitutions. This ruling was so unpopular with the Relief Party that they attempted to remove him from office, but the 5935 vote fell just short of the needed two-thirds majority. Fayette County circuit court judge Francis P. Blair issued a similar ruling in the case of Lapsley v. Brashear.|$|E
5|$|Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin {{had ordered}} all {{settlers}} to stay {{to the east}} of the Divide, as <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> governments had not made peace with the Utes. Nevertheless, some defied the order, drawn by the prospect of mining fortunes. Settlers sometimes used Hunter Pass to get to Ashcroft, an early camp on Castle Creek above the Roaring Fork. However, they preferred to take the southern route over the slightly higher Cottonwood Pass through Taylor Park and then back over Taylor Pass to get there, even though this made for a 100-mile (160km) journey, 40 miles (64km) more than the direct route offered by Hunter Pass.|$|E

5|$|New Melones was {{the focus}} of a long {{environmental}} battle during the 1970s and early 1980s; critics protested the flooding of a long scenic stretch of the Stanislaus River, which flowed over whitewater rapids through the deepest limestone canyon in the western United States. The protestors employed a variety of methods, some extreme, to prevent the filling of New Melones Lake until 1983, when record-setting floods filled the reservoir and nearly breached the dam's emergency spillway. The fight over New Melones galvanized the river conservation movement in California and influenced major water policy changes on <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> levels; since its completion, no other dams of its size or importance have been built in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of {{construction}} is being undertaken {{as part of the}} NorthLink WA project. Tonkin Highway's northern section will be grade separated, and a dual carriageway will be constructed from the Northern end of Tonkin Highway near Reid Highway, past Ellenbrook and through the Swan Valley to an interchange with Great Northern Highway and a new part of Brand Highway, with the extension continuing on as Great Northern Highway. The previously planned route of the bypass, prior to 2012, followed Lord Street, east of Whiteman Park. The project is funded by both <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> governments. Construction began in June 2017, and is scheduled to finish mid 2019.|$|E

5|$|Because the Bill of Rights did not {{initially}} apply to <b>the</b> <b>states,</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> criminal investigations were less {{common in the}} first century of the nation's history, there is little significant case law for the Fourth Amendment before the 20th century.

5|$|The tribe {{sued the}} United States for {{compensation}} in the US Court of Claims, which ruled that tribal members still had {{hunting and fishing}} rights and that Congress had not abrogated the rights. The opposite rulings by <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> courts brought the issue to the Supreme Court. In 1968, the Supreme Court held that the tribe retained its hunting and fishing rights under the treaties involved and the rights were not lost after federal recognition was ended by the Menominee Indian Termination Act without a clear and unequivocal statement by Congress removing the rights.|$|E
5|$|United States v. Lanza {{was one of}} {{a series}} of cases {{involving}} Prohibition. Lanza committed acts allegedly in violation of both state and federal law, and was first convicted in Washington state court, then prosecuted in federal district court.

Taft, for a unanimous court, allowed the second prosecution, holding that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> governments were dual sovereigns, each empowered to prosecute the conduct in question.|$|E

As the capital, the city is vital to the political and economic welfare of the state.

5|$|The {{economy of}} Grand Forks is not {{dominated}} by any one industry or sector. While agriculture {{continues to play}} a role in the area's economy, the city of Grand Forks now has a relatively diverse economy that includes public and private employers in sectors such as education, defense, health care, manufacturing, and food processing. <b>The</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> governments are two of the largest employers in the Grand Forks area. The University of North Dakota, in the heart of the city, is the largest employer in the metropolitan area. Grand Forks Air Force Base, just west of the city, employs a large number of civilian workers in addition to its military personnel. Altru Health System is the largest private employer in Grand Forks.|$|E
5|$|The flood had {{a massive}} effect on Fairbanks. Four people were killed, {{and the damage}} ran into the {{hundreds}} of millions of dollars. It helped push the city's remaining farm, Creamer's Dairy, into bankruptcy, and it forced the closure of St. Joseph's Hospital. Fairbanks residents responded to the problems with aplomb. The annual Tanana Valley State Fair was postponed but not canceled. Seven thousand dollars were raised to buy Creamer's Dairy and turn it into a bird sanctuary. KTVF, one of the few town businesses to have flood insurance, rebuilt its studio and became the first Fairbanks TV station to broadcast in color, four months after the flood. When two bond measures to build a government-run hospital were turned down by Fairbanks voters, residents raised $2.6 million from private contributions and $6 million from <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> government to build Fairbanks Memorial Hospital.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was first}} {{designated}} along {{a series of}} roads between Appleton and Minneapolis around 1933. At first these roads were a mixture of gravel and bitumen surfaces, the latter a forerunner of today's asphalt. Within the first year or so, the western end was extended to terminate MN7 in the Ortonville area. In 1958, the highway was extended to its modern western terminus at Beardsley by replacing another trunk highway. The section that is now an expressway in the Twin Cities was expanded by the 1950s, and the whole highway was paved in a hard-surface {{by the end of}} that decade. The highway was truncated in the Twin Cities to its current eastern terminus in the 1980s. The scenic byways designations were applied at <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> levels in 1995 and 2002, respectively.|$|E
