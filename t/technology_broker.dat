50|$|Commercialization Reactor is {{an ongoing}} {{business}} workshop combining features of pre-seed accelerator, seed fund, business incubator, <b>technology</b> <b>broker,</b> technology transfer office, commercialization agent of universities and educational project. The main difference {{from all of the}} above forms of support is that the model of the Commercialization Reactor implements natural forming of teams instead of selecting people from existing teams of technology enthusiasts. The ultimate requirement is that each team should have a strong scientific foundation enforced by entrepreneurial spirit which, when combined, define a path to success. Consequently, identifying team players and team building is one of the core activities of Commercialization Reactor. Commercialization of science-based innovations is of course higher risk with a longer timeline, and cost then IT / web-based or sustaining innovation projects. Therefore, unlike traditional accelerators, which select projects with already formed business models and teams, Commercialization Reactor selects scientific / engineering ideas and develops them by adding and coaching business teams and by providing initial investment.|$|E
40|$|The {{recognition}} that innovation occurs in networks of heterogeneous actors and requires broad systemic support beyond knowledge brokering {{has resulted in}} a changing landscape in the intermediary domain in the increasingly market-driven agricultural sector in developing countries. This paper presents findings of an explorative case study that looked at 22 organizations identified as fulfilling an intermediary role in the Kenyan agricultural sector. The results show that these organizations fulfill functions that are not limited to distribution of knowledge and putting it into use but also include fostering integration and interaction among the diverse actors engaged in innovation networks and working on technological, organizational, and institutional innovation. Further, the study has identified various organizational arrangements of innovation intermediaries, with some organizations fulfilling a specialized innovation brokering role and other intermediaries taking on brokering as a side activity, while substantively contributing to the innovation process. On the basis of these findings, we identify a typology of four innovation intermediation arrangements including <b>technology</b> <b>broker,</b> systemic broker, enterprise development support, and input access support. The results indicate that innovation brokering is a pervasive task in supporting innovation and will require policy support to embed it in innovation support arrangements, but without prescribing a one-size-fits-all approach...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – Many studies {{emphasize}} the importance of technology brokers in fostering innovation in small and medium enterprises. Despite this acknowledged relevance, the literature does not supply a clear vision of the key activities that characterise the intervention of such intermediaries. This paper aims to identify the key brokers’ activities and their overall process of intervention to clarify the role of <b>technology</b> <b>broker</b> in fostering innovation in Small and Medium Enterprises. Design/methodology/approach – The research process was based on in-depth theoretical and empirical investigations. Firstly, using an approach that combined elements of systematic literature review with focus group meetings, we identified a research framework synthesizing the key activities that characterize the brokers’ intervention. Subsequent, to get a closer insight into brokers’ role, we investigated empirically the activities and intervention process of six bridging institutions. Originality/value – Reviewing literature, we developed a research framework showing the groups of activities the brokers could carry out to support innovation in SMEs. The empirical analysis of the six heterogeneous bridging organizations provides an overview of the brokers’ activities and highlights the presence of different possible level of interventions. Merging theoretical and empirical evidences, the paper synthetizes the overall process of intervention of technology brokers and the presence of three main brokers’ roles, namely networking role, integration role and absorptive role. Practical implications – The identified research framework and the three brokers’ role could be useful to investigate empirically the brokerage institutions operating in the national and international context...|$|E
50|$|Many {{companies}} {{today are}} restructuring their R&D departments {{and they are}} finding the structure of <b>technology</b> <b>brokering</b> to be very successful and cost-effective for innovation. Not only is <b>technology</b> <b>brokering</b> a business foundation for design firms, {{it can also be}} used inside large corporations in order to achieve inter-departmental innovations. Andrew Hargadon was really the first person to coin the term ‘technology brokering’ and advocate to industry its advantages. He did this in the late 1980s, early 1990s, now the concept of <b>technology</b> <b>brokering</b> is fairly common. The Hargadon Group currently advises businesses ranging from Fortune 500 companies to start-ups about how to integrate a <b>technology</b> <b>brokering</b> system into their innovation process.|$|R

50|$|<b>Technology</b> <b>brokering</b> {{can teach}} firms how to {{effectively}} shift the focus of traditional R&D teams from trying to invent completely new products to combining previous innovations. New ideas for observation based research pull R&D scientists out of the lab and place them into direct consumer observation {{to allow them to}} diagnose problems with products and identify the needs of the customer more accurately. The <b>technology</b> <b>brokering</b> process intertwines with the idea of empathic design, which is basically understanding products from a customers’ point of view and then designing them to fit needs and issues. The advantage of empathic design, especially when combined with <b>technology</b> <b>brokering</b> firms, is that it leads to innovative products that suit the particular problems of the customer. Another perk of empathic design is including marketing and manufacturing people in the product design to get diverse opinions of product success and practicality.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} proposes {{an investigation}} into the creation and the later development, in the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, of a private company called CRIT Srl, constituted by a group of large and medium-sized mechanical firms. The purpose of CRIT is not only to act as a <b>technology</b> <b>broker,</b> but also to provide in-teraction spaces between firms, and to contribute to the establishment of new networks of firms, therefore acting as a scaffolding structure. The decision to set up CRIT, in 2000, emerged {{in the context of a}} project concerning the construction of a Science Park in Vignola (in the province of Modena) that had been discussed since the second half of the 1990 s. After having outlined some important elements of the history of this project (PST ex-Sipe), we will examine the whole range of activities that CRIT had developed in the course of nine years, from 2000 to 2008. Over time, most of the services offered by CRIT, to member and non-member firms, underwent changes following the members’ proposals and their changing needs. This study is part of a wider research project, that investigates public policies and pri-vate interventions that sustain innovation in systems of SMEs. See Russo and Rossi (2009), Rossi, Russo, Sardo and Whitford (2009), Russo and Whitford (2009). The last paper, in particular, uses data that are presented in this work, and it analyzes the characteristics of the network created by CRIT’s actions. technology broker; science park; innovation...|$|E
5000|$|The idea of <b>technology</b> <b>brokering</b> is to span multiple, {{otherwise}} disconnected industries, {{to see how}} existing technologies {{could be}} used to create breakthrough innovations in other markets. <b>Technology</b> <b>brokering</b> requires companies to be strong in two areas. As Andrew Hargadon, technology brokering’s founder, summarized: [...] "Firstly, the company must have the ability to bridge distant communities, usually when a company can move easily across a range of different markets they have a better view of how technologies can be used in new ways. Secondly, <b>technology</b> <b>brokering</b> involves creating new markets and industries from innovative combinations of existing technology. These two strengths are difficult to have simultaneously because the strong ties the companies have with customers and supplies in one industry prevent the company from moving easily into other markets and experimenting with new ideas." [...] Yet, when a company is able to combine these two strengths it can result in being the first to experience technological advances.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{recognized}} that Edison understood {{the concept of}} <b>technology</b> <b>brokering.</b> And some of his methods were rather elementary.

50|$|Another {{excellent}} example of <b>technology</b> <b>brokering</b> is the telephone. Since it was invented, the telephone has undergone {{a great number of}} changes: from residential-only, to being portable in a brief case, to more modernized digital cell phones with access to internet and much more. It seemed as though the residential phone would disappear completely due to the technology found in the cellular phones; however, <b>technology</b> <b>brokering</b> was able to bring about a huge change in residential phones. Verizon communications recently introduced the Verizon Hub, a residential phone that allows you to send and receive text-messages, pictures, connect to the internet, and link your cell phone to your Verizon Hub so you can answer your home phone even if not at home.|$|R

5000|$|Thomas Edison was an inventor, a {{business}} man, {{and most importantly}} an innovator. In 1875 Edison purchased a single model home in New Jersey. This property {{is referred to as}} one of his first major innovations; the first industrial research lab, [...] "Menlo Park." [...] This would be the location of over 400 inventions and prove to be a prime example of Thomas Edison using <b>technology</b> <b>brokering</b> to innovate. Edison has stated that he built this laboratory for the; [...] "Rapid and cheap development of an invention." [...] He also promised, [...] "A minor invention every ten days and a major invention every six months." [...] How could Edison make such bold projections? Edison developed four intertwined work practices that helped him be so innovative. They were: capturing good ideas, keeping these ideas alive, imagining new uses for old ideas, and putting promising concepts to test. Using these concepts, which underline the concepts of <b>technology</b> <b>brokering,</b> Edison is credited with 1,093 U.S. patents as well as patents in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Technology</b> <b>brokers</b> {{are people}} who {{discovered}} how to bridge the emergent worlds and apply scientific concepts or processes to new situations or circumstances. [...] A related term, used almost synonymously, is [...] "technology valorisation". While conceptually the practice has been utilized for many years (in ancient times, Archimedes was notable for applying science to practical problems), the present-day volume of research, combined with high-profile failures at Xerox PARC and elsewhere, {{has led to a}} focus on the process itself.|$|R
5000|$|In the 29th Information Systems Research Conference in Scandinavia [...] in 2006 the {{transition}} path from closed innovation to open innovation was formally described. As a result, {{it was found}} that when seeking to increase customer loyalty and attracting new customers, companies needed to increase customer involvement in research and design (R&D) operation. Brokering and social networking processes {{lie at the heart of}} the open innovation paradigm. The <b>technology</b> <b>brokering</b> process model by Hargadon and Sutton (1997) describes the shift towards open innovation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Technology</b> <b>Brokering</b> {{can make}} an impact on any kind of product {{regardless}} of its nature. For example, a bar tap handle could be pretty much anything, a stick or piece of metal, a button, etc. However, {{with the help of}} IDEO, Sam Adams was able to innovate its bar tap handles. The totally redesigned Sam Adams tap continues to have a similar shape as the others, but Sam Adams’ has a blue fluorescent cover displaying the Sam Adams brand while giving a sense of the elegance and class behind the Sam Adams brand.|$|R

40|$|Interpreting {{technological}} invention as {{an evolutionary}} and recombinant search process, we study {{the effect of}} <b>technology</b> <b>brokering,</b> i. e. creating new inventions by combining formerly disconnected but familiar technology components, on the likelihood of inventing more useful and particularly breakthrough inventions. For evidence, we consider 26 years of the US patent record in biotechnology.

50|$|The {{beauty of}} <b>technology</b> <b>brokering</b> is not inventing totally new products, {{it is the}} ability to reimage or {{recreate}} a product while using an old idea/product. For example, the Craving Aid Patch was a product originally designed for smokers and in many cases seen as a medical procedure. Nonetheless, exactly the same idea has now been used to create a totally different product using the same technology. Similar to the Craving Aid Patch, which is just an old idea reinvented into a new product, the Verizon Hub, perhaps the most modern residential phone, is based on the very same idea as when it was first invented, in the years of Alexander Graham Bell.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the major}} {{features}} of gameplay is scientific research. Completing the research of a new technology will make available new units, city improvements and wonders of the world, as well as special bonuses and abilities {{that are related to}} the technology. The technology tree is divided into four ages (Ancient Age, Middle Ages, Industrial Age, and Modern Age); each age requires the research of specific technologies to advance to that age. Additionally, there are technologies that provide useful bonuses that are often essential for good empire management, or may provide different alternatives to it. Technologies can also be traded to and from other civilizations in return for resources or other technologies. Technologies acquired in this way can in turn be exchanged (also called <b>technology</b> <b>brokering)</b> for other new technologies by contacting one or more other civilizations.|$|R
40|$|Patterns of patent in-licensing and out-licensing are {{examined}} among Japanese {{firms in the}} pharmaceuticals and electronics industries. Sixty-five questionnaires and 24 interview-based cases provide insights into what influences the decisions to 'make-or-buy' (in-license) knowledge assets and to 'exploit-or-sell' (out-license) R&D outputs. Firm size and resources, the existing portfolio of technologies, and ongoing exploitation strategies are all influential. Significant increases in in-licensing and out-licensing and associated changes {{in the management of}} intellectual property are also a response to changing competitive pressures and markets in Japan for both these sets of firms. Reciprocal technology-sharing agreements are evolving into more formalised relationships and firms are being pushed to improve their <b>technology</b> <b>brokering</b> capabilities. Looking beyond abstracted patent data, the study provides additional insights into the influences on strategic R&D selection as well as the general management dilemmas associated with the leveraging of intellectual assets, core competence selection and 'markets versus hierarchies' decision making...|$|R
50|$|The first {{examples}} of <b>technology</b> <b>brokering</b> {{can be found}} as early as 1876 with Thomas Edison in his Menlo Park laboratory. In six years, this lab procured over 400 patents. Menlo Park laboratory was such a successful ‘invention factory’ because Thomas Edison had a firm belief in recombinant innovation. There were no inventions from Menlo Park that were truly invented from nothing - each one had some basis that was pulled from another field of technology. Edison and his team worked in many different fields in conjunction with many different companies, in addition to working on individual experiments. All of these projects enabled the team to use their knowledge of various fields to be innovative in creating new solutions for different organizations. Because knowledge of technology across differing fields was disconnected, Edison was able to exploit this and create new solutions from areas of past projects.|$|R
40|$|Actes à paraître. In today's {{innovation}} based {{competition and}} {{with the increase of}} the innovation pace, the open innovation model (Chesbrough, 2003) appears {{as a response to the}} challenges the firms face. Hence, several authors have underlined that mobilizing knowledge external to the firm enhances its innovation ability. Von Hippel (1986) highlighted the role and knowledge of lead-users in innovation processes. Cohen and Levinthal (1990) introduced the notion of absorptive capacity to highlight the role of R&D departments in identifying and assimilating knowledge from the environment. Hargadon and Sutton (1997) showed that some firms that get involved in <b>technology</b> <b>brokering</b> generate innovative solutions thanks to their connections to various technological knowledge networks. If researchers agree to consider that leveraging external knowledge do foster innovation, the processes by which it occurs are complex and understudied. We focus more specifically on the connect phase. How are topics on which to look for external knowledge identified and formalized? How to involve external entities in order to mobilize their knowledge and combine it with the internal one in order to develop new solutions? How to assess the value of various external technical solutions? We propose to formalize four steps and highlight their specificities...|$|R

Hargadon in 1998 introduced this concept setting a promising research agenda, but then focused mainly on the <b>technology</b> <b>brokering</b> activity.

The aim of this contribution is to provide a better understanding about knowledge brokering: which are the differences from other strategic orientations, the key capabilities needed to support effectively this activity and the business practices in the actual scenario, its impact on the competitive advantage. The study proposes a case study survey concerning three companies: Accenture, Alessi, ENI. Evidences support knowledge broker as a 'creator' and not purely carrier of knowledge between disconnected domains. The geographic dimension emerges in all the analyzed cases. The knowledge broker is characterized by a global orientation of upstream (technology, design, [...] .) and downstream (customers, distributors, [...] .) markets and by a multilocal understanding of where and how the needed specific knowledge can be found.

40|$|Technological {{innovation}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly significant driving force of firm competitiveness; however, only a few scholars have attempted to investigate the specific relationship between technological innovation and human resource (HR). In this study, we test the relationships among high-commitment human resource management (HCHRM) system, HR capability and ambidextrous technological innovation, {{as well as the}} mediating role of HR capability in the relationship between the other two. For this purpose, we derive HR capability based on two dimensions: (a) factors (skills vs. behaviors) and (b) nature (component vs. combinative capability). Juxtaposing these dimensions enables us to generate the following four elements of HR capability for ambidextrous technological innovation: (a) T-shaped skills (component skills), (b) <b>technology</b> <b>brokering</b> (combinative skills), (c) personal initiative (component behaviors), and (d) cooperation (combinative behaviors). Empirical results based on data collected from the HR and technology planning managers of 105 corporate research and development centers indicate that HCHRM positively affects HR capability and ambidextrous technological innovation. In addition, we find that HR capability fully mediates the relationship between the HCHRM system and ambidextrous technological innovation. We discuss theoretical contributions and practical implications of these findings. ope...|$|R

40|$|Conference paper. Accounting, {{as it is}} {{currently}} practiced, has {{lost much of its}} ability to inform as businesses have become more and more knowledge intensive. Intangible assets are now variously estimated to currently constitute 60 - 75 percent of corporate value, on average (Lev, 2002). Research to date has yet to conclude how best to measure this intellectual capital (Brennan & Connell, 2000). Current debates about intellectual capital are part of the search for a methodology to measure the knowledge base of a firm (Power, 2001). This is critical since a failure to properly conceptualize the nature and value of knowledge assets condemns firms and whole economies to fight competitive battles with outdated weapons and tactics (Boisot, 1998). The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a comparative evaluation of some of the most commonly known intellectual capital (IC) models.

40|$|To {{deal with}} the pace of {{technological}} development and the risks and costs imposed by R&D projects, firms need to collaborate and engage in technology partnerships going from licensing agreement to research joint venture. However, managers often struggle to find a right partner, to negotiate the contracts, to monitor the contractual relationships, and to enforce the contractual commitments. Entities (that we call ‘third parties’) have progressively developed skills that are highly valuable for firms wishing to engage in technology partnerships. Key third parties are <b>technology</b> <b>brokers,</b> patent attorneys, auditing firms, arbitrators, trade associations, and collective research centers. Surprisingly, the role of these third parties in technology partnerships has received extremely limited attention in the strategic management and business economics literature. This dissertation investigates the use of third-party services in technology partnerships through one theoretical and two empirical essays. We use as our frame of reference Transaction Cost Economics and Social Network Theory. Both streams of research provide specific {{pieces of the puzzle}} as we argue that relying on third parties will be variously beneficial depending on the transaction attributes and the firm’s social embeddedness. In light of this, the first essay positions the third parties in the Social Network framework. The second and third essays are empirical essays focusing on a specific form of technology partnership: the licensing agreement. The second essay investigates firms’ decision to resort to third parties at the first three contractual stages (identification, negotiation, and monitoring) and the third essay examines the last contractual stage (enforcement) through firms’ decision to include an arbitration provision in their contracts.
