40|$|By {{taking the}} measure {{and working out}} indexes in all the items, {{statistical}} observations were made <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants of Kanto, Hokuriku and Kinki Districts. It was revealed that <b>the</b> <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants of Kanto District differed from those of Hokuriku District in many items, and also from those of Kinki District in a considerable number <b>of</b> items. Between <b>the</b> <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants of Kanto and Hokuriku Districts {{there were significant differences}} in 26 items : <b>the</b> male <b>skull</b> showed significant differences in 20 items, <b>the</b> female <b>skull</b> in 15 items and both male and female skulls in 10 items. Between <b>the</b> <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants of Kanto and Kinki Districts, there were significant differences in 20 items : <b>the</b> male <b>skull</b> showed significant differences in 18 items, <b>the</b> female <b>skull</b> in 9 items and both male and female skulls in 7 items. These observations indicate that <b>the</b> <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants of Kanto District considerably differ in size not only from those of Hokuriku District but also from those of Kinki District. Survey of the items in which significant differences were found shows that, while significant differences existing between <b>the</b> <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants of Kanto and Hokuriku Districts were confined to a series of items and those existing between <b>the</b> <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> inhabitants of Kanto -and Kinki Districts to another series of items, significant differences existed between <b>the</b> <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants of Kanto District and those of both Hokuriku and Kinki Districts in a few items...|$|R

5|$|In the skull, the braincase is high, the {{zygomatic}} arches (cheekbones) are {{broad and}} squared, and the incisive foramina, which perforate the palate between the incisors and the molars, {{are long and}} broad. The upper incisors are orthodont, with their cutting edge nearly vertical. Morphometrically, <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> O.peninsulae is sharply distinct from other western Mexican Oryzomys.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{brain to}} have been {{discovered}} was in Armenia in the Areni-1 cave complex. The brain, estimated to be over 5,000 years old, was found in <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> a 12 to 14-year-old girl. Although the brains were shriveled, they were well preserved due to the climate found inside the cave.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> the Acrocanthosaurus atokensis holotype shows light exostotic {{material}} on the squamosal. The neural spine of the eleventh vertebra was fractured and healed while the neural spine of its third tail vertebra had an unusual hook-like structure.|$|E

5|$|When {{originally}} {{described by}} Brown, Prosaurolophus maximus was known from a skull and jaw. Half {{of the skull}} was badly weathered {{at the time of}} examination, and the level of the parietal was distortedly crushed upwards to the side. The different bones of the skull could be easily defined, {{with the exception of the}} parietals and nasal bones. Brown found that <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> the already described genus Saurolophus is very similar overall to, but also smaller than <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> P. maximus. A unique feature of a shortened frontal in lambeosaurines is also found in Prosaurolophus, and the other horned hadrosaurines Brachylophosaurus, Maiasaura, and Saurolophus. Although they lack a shorter frontal, the genera Edmontosaurus and Shantungosaurus share with saurolophins an elongated dentary.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} D. horneri skulls suggest that unlike many depictions of tyrannosaurids, this genus and likely other tyrannosaurids did not possess lips. Comparisons of <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> this species with modern {{crocodiles}} {{show the same}} rugose bone structure that indicates the presence of large flat scales as opposed to lips. As the rough texture descends almost to the tooth line, it is theorized that Daspletosaurus teeth were not covered by lips, as {{there would have been}} no room for such soft tissue.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} toothed whales, <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> the sperm whale is {{asymmetrical}} {{so as to}} aid echolocation. Sound waves that strike the whale from different directions will not be channeled in the same way. Within the basin of the cranium, the openings of the bony narial tubes (from which the nasal passages spring) are skewed towards {{the left side of}} the skull.|$|E
5|$|Hippopotamus lemerlei bones {{have been}} mostly {{discovered}} in the rivers and lakes of western Madagascar, suggesting a riparian lifestyle, {{very similar to that}} of the modern hippopotamus of modern Africa. H. lemerlei also shared the high-orbits that make it easier for the hippopotamus to see while in the water. <b>The</b> <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> H. lemerlei also resembled that of the modern hippopotamus, but with consistent size differences, indicating that H. lemerlei was a sexually dimorphic species.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 Lü {{and colleagues}} {{proposed}} that the articulation between the quadrate and quadratojugal bones in <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> Nemegtomaia suggested that these bones were movable in relation to each other, which would have affected how the jaws functioned. In 2015 Christophe Hendrickx and colleagues found it unlikely that Nemegtomaia and other oviraptords had bird-like kinesis in their skulls, due to the quadrate bone being immobile.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Vikings drank out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> vanquished enemies. This was a misconception based on a passage in the skaldic poem Krákumál speaking of heroes drinking from ór bjúgviðum hausa (branches <b>of</b> <b>skulls).</b> This was a reference to drinking horns, but was mistranslated in the 17th century as referring to <b>the</b> <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slain.|$|R

50|$|Lions' <b>skulls</b> rival those <b>of</b> tigers in size or length (Pease, 1913, page 101), {{with even}} <b>the</b> largest known <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> tigers being smaller than <b>the</b> largest known <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> lions, albeit slightly. Apart from their sizes, <b>the</b> <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> lions and tigers are {{generally}} similar, with there being differences in structural {{features of the}} lower jaws, relative lengths of their noses, and the frontal regions. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> lions, especially from Asia, were so {{similar to those of}} tigers that Heptner and Sludskii (1972) argued that the lion was closer to the tiger than to other animals like the leopard and jaguar, unlike what others believed.|$|R
5|$|Majungasaurus, being {{known from}} many well-preserved {{specimens}} of different ages, is well studied {{in regards to}} its growth and development. Throughout ontogeny, <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> Majungasaurus (more specifically, the jugal, postorbital, and quadratojugal) seems to have become taller and more robust; additionally, the skull bones became more fused and the eye sockets became proportionally smaller. This indicates a shift in dietary preferences between juveniles and adults.|$|E
5|$|The attack {{occurred}} at 21:15 on a Wednesday evening, {{as a football}} game featuring Spain and Iceland was being shown. The four participants exited their car carrying shotguns and machine guns and opened fire on the bar. The bullets shattered <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> three of the victims and hit the fourth in the heart. Three of the targets were killed instantly, with the fourth dying shortly afterwards in hospital. A fifth person was injured after being hit in the foot, but survived the attack.|$|E
5|$|The first toothless {{ancestors}} of Mysticetes {{appeared before the}} first radiation in the late Oligocene. Eomysticetus {{and others like it}} showed no evidence in <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> echolocation abilities, suggesting they mainly relied on their eyesight for navigation. The eomysticetes had long, flat rostra that lacked teeth and had blowholes located halfway up the dorsal side of the snout. Though the palate is not well-preserved in these specimens, they are thought to have had baleen and been filter feeders. Miocene baleen whales were preyed upon by larger predators like killer sperm whales and Megalodon.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> Apatosaurus was {{confused}} {{with that of}} Camarasaurus and Brachiosaurus until 1909, when the holotype of A. louisae was found, and a complete skull just a few meters away {{from the front of}} the neck. Henry Fairfield Osborn disagreed with this association, and went on to mount a skeleton of Apatosaurus with a Camarasaurus skull cast. Until 1970, Apatosaurus skeletons were mounted with speculative skull casts, when McIntosh showed that more robust skulls assigned to Diplodocus were more likely from Apatosaurus.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> Pachylemur is {{relatively}} broad, but the orbits (eye sockets) are smaller and oriented more {{towards the front}} than in the ruffed lemurs. In the postcranial skeleton, the most distinctive traits of Pachylemur are found. It had shorter and more robust limbs than the ruffed lemurs, and the fore- and hindlimbs were closer in length (intermembral index of approximately 97).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> Patagosaurus is {{not very}} well known, with a 2003 {{revision}} by Oliver Rahut determining only a few jaws are certainly referrable to it, as opposed to nearly the entire skull. MPEF-PV 1670 shows what the morphology of the adult or subadult skull was like, while MACN CH 933 represents a juvenile individual. Based upon how broad, high and short the adult articulated mandibles of Patagosaurus are, its snout would have been short, high and broad as well, a typical feature of most sauropods.|$|E
