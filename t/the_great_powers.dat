5|$|<b>The</b> <b>great</b> <b>powers</b> of Europe in the Early Modern {{period were}} the result of a gradual process of {{centralization}} of power taking place {{over the course of the}} Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|On October 27, 1914, after {{approval}} from <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Powers,</b> the Greek army re-entered the area. During the Greek administration, {{and while the}} First World War continued, it had been agreed between Greece, Italy and <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Powers</b> that the final settlement of the Northern Epirote issue {{should be left to}} the future, after the war ended. After Venizelos' resignation in December however, the succeeding royalist governments were determined to exploit the situation and pre-determine the region's future by incorporating it formally within the Greek state. In the first months of 1916, Northern Epirus participated in the Greek elections and elected 16 representatives for the Greek Parliament. In March, the region's union with Greece was officially declared, and the area was divided into the prefectures of Argyrokastro and Korytsa.|$|E
50|$|Dengeki Sentai Changeman: The Earthforce (Āsufōsu) is the mystrious {{energy source}} of <b>the</b> Changemen's <b>power.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Power</b> of <b>the</b> Changemen {{was one of}} <b>the</b> three <b>Great</b> <b>Powers</b> that was stolen by Basco before his failed attempt to claim <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Power</b> of <b>the</b> Ohrangers. <b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Power</b> is stolen from Shō Hayate, who later calls Goro Hoshino of the United Airforce Overtech Hardware to alert him of Basco's actions. <b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Power</b> is gained after Basco's defeat and Shō's approval.|$|R

50|$|Chikyu Sentai Fiveman: <b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Power</b> of <b>the</b> Fivemen {{was stolen}} by Basco {{off-screen}} before the attempted execution of Captain Marvelous. <b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Power</b> is gained after Basco's defeat and Remi Hoshikawa's approval.|$|R
5|$|The {{effect of}} his (and his advisors') {{policies}} {{was to make}} the Great Powers' parties more powerful, not less. <b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Powers</b> did not support curtailing Otto's increasing absolutism, however, which resulted in a near permanent conflict between Otto's absolute monarchy and the power bases of his Greek subjects.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} machinations of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Powers</b> were personified {{in their}} three legates in Athens: the French Theobald Piscatory, the Russian Gabriel Catacazy, and the English Edmund Lyons. They informed their home governments {{on the activities}} of the Greeks, while serving as advisers to their respective allied parties within Greece.|$|E
5|$|As a {{response}} to the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, Venizelos's power base was further strengthened, and on 8 October 1908 the Cretan Assembly passed a resolution in favor of union despite both the reservations of the Athens government under Georgios Theotokis and the objections of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Powers.</b> The muted reaction of the Athens Government to the news from Crete led to an unsettled state of affairs on the mainland.|$|E
50|$|Taiyo Sentai Sun Vulcan: <b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Power</b> of Sun Vulcan {{was stolen}} by Basco {{off-screen}} before the attempted execution of Captain Marvelous. <b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Power</b> is gained after Basco's defeat and Takayuki Hiba's approval.|$|R
50|$|Before a <b>Great</b> <b>Power</b> {{can reach}} a trade {{agreement}} with a Minor <b>Power,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Power</b> must build a Trade Consulate in the Minor <b>Power.</b> Before <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Power</b> can sign a treaty with a Minor <b>Power,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Power</b> must build an Embassy in the Minor Power. The money required to build Trade Consulates and Embassies is significant, especially early in the game, when the player's revenue is limited. All <b>Great</b> <b>Powers</b> automatically possess Embassies with {{each other at the}} beginning of the game.|$|R

5|$|Later that year, after {{continued}} {{unrest in}} Crete, {{which included the}} murder of the British vice-consul, Prince George of Greece was made the Governor-General of Crete under the suzerainty of the Sultan, after the proposal was put forward by <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Powers.</b> Greece was effectively in day-to-day control of Crete {{for the first time in}} modern history.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Greek army {{evacuated}} from the region, and, on 1 March, Korytsa (Korçë) was ceded {{to the newly}} formed Albanian gendarmerie. Serious disturbances broke out {{in a number of}} places between the Autonomist forces and Albanian gendarmerie units and irregulars. Meanwhile, an International Commission formed by <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Powers</b> to secure stability and peace in the region was unable to achieve an agreement between the two sides.|$|E
5|$|On June 1 <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Powers</b> (including Italy and Austria-Hungary) {{approved}} {{the results of}} the negotiations and on June 23 the terms of the Protocol were officially approved by the Albanian Government. The Greek government, without being involved until then in the situation, was aware of the negotiations and the possibility of a final agreement. Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos advised Georgios Christakis-Zografos to approve the protocol’s terms without asking for even wider autonomy.|$|E

Once freed, he decided to observe the Gokaigers {{to see if the}} team was worthy of <b>the</b> <b>Greater</b> <b>Power</b> of <b>the</b> Gokaigers. Eventually they {{impressed}} him enough to grant them <b>the</b> <b>Greater</b> <b>Power,</b> {{which turned out to be}} himself.|$|R

5|$|Rhodes also {{concentrated}} on the Rhodes Scholarship, which had British statesman Alfred Milner {{as one of its}} trustees. Established in 1902, the original goal of the trust fund was to foster peace among <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>powers</b> by creating a sense of fraternity and a shared world view among future British, American, and German leaders by having enabled them to study for free at the University of Oxford.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{government}} {{was reluctant to}} overtly support the uprising. Military and political officials continued {{to carry out a}} slow evacuation process, which had begun in March and ended on 28 April. Resistance was officially discouraged, and assurances were given that <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Powers</b> and the International Control Commission (an organization founded by <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Powers</b> in order to secure peace and stability in the area) would guarantee their rights. Following the declaration in Gjirokastër, Zografos sent messages to local representatives in Korçë (gr. Korytsá) asking them to join the movement; however, the Greek military commander of the city, Colonel Alexandros Kontoulis, followed his official orders strictly and declared martial law, threatening to shoot any citizen raising the Northern Epirote flag. When the local bishop of Kolonjë (gr. Kolónia), Spyridon, proclaimed the Autonomy, Kontoulis had him immediately arrested and expelled.|$|E
5|$|The League of Nations {{has been}} a disappointing failure.... It {{has been a}} failure, not because the United States did not join it; but because <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>powers</b> have been unwilling to apply {{sanctions}} except where it suited their individual national interests to do so, and because Democracy, on which the original concepts of the League rested for support, has collapsed over half the world.|$|E
50|$|Building Diplomatic {{power can}} be key to winning the game. When a <b>Great</b> <b>Power</b> is in an {{alliance}} with another <b>Great</b> <b>Power,</b> or has signed a non-aggression pact with a Minor <b>Power,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Power</b> {{is expected to go}} to war if the other Power is attacked. In the case of two <b>Great</b> <b>Powers</b> that share an alliance, if one <b>Great</b> <b>Power</b> starts a war, <b>the</b> other <b>Great</b> <b>Power</b> is also expected to go to war. If a player decides not to honor an alliance or non-aggression pact, <b>the</b> player's <b>Great</b> <b>Power</b> loses diplomatic standing and may find it harder to negotiate alliances in the future. Negotiating a separate peace instead of waging total war will also break an alliance, with the same effect on a <b>Great</b> <b>Power's</b> diplomatic standing as if <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Power</b> had refused to go to war in the first place.|$|R

5|$|These events worried Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, {{as well as}} the {{possibility}} that the unstable situation could spill over outside Albania, triggering a wider conflict. On 27 October, after receiving the approval of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Powers,</b> the Greek Army's V Army Corps entered the area for a second time. The provisional government formally ceased to exist, declaring that it had accomplished its objectives.|$|E
5|$|This turn {{of events}} proved highly unpopular with the local Greek population, and their representatives under Georgios Christakis-Zografos formed the Panepirotic Assembly in Gjirokastër in protest. The Assembly, short of {{incorporation}} with Greece, demanded either local autonomy or an international occupation by forces of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Powers</b> for the districts of Gjirokastër, Sarandë, and Korçë.|$|E
5|$|As a cardinal, Paul had {{previously}} maintained neutrality between <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>powers</b> of Spain and France that had dominated the previous conclave and {{were present in}} the current one as well. While he had been the papal envoy to Spain and was receiving a pension from them, he was largely low profile as a cardinal and perceived as neutral. At 52, Paul was young {{at the time of his}} election, and was anticipated to have a lengthy papacy, not requiring a third conclave soon.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{his having}} overtly {{undermined}} the king, Armansperg was dismissed from his duties by King Otto immediately {{upon his return}} from Germany. However, despite high hopes {{on the part of}} the Greeks, the Bavarian Rudhart was appointed chief minister, and the granting of a constitution was again postponed. The attempts of Otto to conciliate Greek sentiment through efforts to enlarge the frontiers of his kingdom, for example, by the suggested acquisition of Crete in 1841, failed in their objective, and only succeeded in embroiling him in conflict with <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Powers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hydra and {{her sisters}} saw heavy service with the Greek Navy. They participated in the GrecoTurkish War in 1897 until <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Powers</b> intervened and {{prevented}} the Greek Navy from capitalizing on their superiority over the Ottoman Navy. Hydra saw action in the First Balkan War at the Naval Battle of Elli and {{was present at the}} Naval Battle of Lemnos, but was too slow to actively engage the Ottoman forces. She did not see action during World War I, and was reduced to a gunnery training ship {{after the end of the}} war. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Korçë {{belongs to}} the region {{regarded}} as Northern Epirus, a region with substantial Albanian, Aromanian and Greek populations. The Greek national view was to classify all Aromanians and Orthodox Albanians {{as part of the}} Greek minority. <b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Powers</b> signed the Protocol of Florence and awarded the region to the newly founded Principality of Albania on December 17, 1913. Gradual withdrawal of the Greek army would enable the Albanian forces {{to take control of the}} region. Consequently, to avert this possibility, pro-Greek Epirotes decided to declare their own separate political identity and self-governance.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the events}} of Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger, Tsuruhime was {{originally}} supposed to grant <b>the</b> <b>Greater</b> <b>Power</b> of <b>the</b> Kakurangers to the Gokaigers, which was Ninjaman. However the Gokaigers managed to discover and release Ninjaman before being approached by Tsuruhime. Tsuruhime then decided to allow Ninjaman to grant <b>the</b> <b>Greater</b> <b>Power</b> to <b>the</b> Gokaigers, impressed {{at the fact that}} they found and freed him on their own.|$|R
