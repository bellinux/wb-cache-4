5|$|In 1996, the Minister of National Defense {{established}} a jack of the President of <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poland</b> {{with the purpose}} of flying it on Polish Navy ships while the commander-in-chief is on board. The jack is identical in its design to the former Banner of <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poland.</b> In 2005, the use of the presidential jack was extended to all branches of the Polish Armed Forces. It was first flown on land during a Constitution Day ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw on May 3, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Derived {{from early}} Slavic flag-like objects, a royal banner of arms dates {{as far back}} as the 11th century CE. A symbol of royal authority, it was used at coronations and in battles. In the interwar period, it was {{replaced}} with the Banner of <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poland,</b> which was part of the presidential insignia. A national banner is not mentioned in the current (2007) regulations on Polish national symbols, although today's presidential jack is based directly on the pre-war design for the Banner of the Republic.|$|E

5|$|In August 1919, the Sejm (lower {{house of}} parliament) of the renascent Republic of Poland adopted a law {{defining}} the Banner of <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poland</b> (chorągiew Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej). The banner {{was part of}} the insignia of the head of statethe State Leader (Naczelnik Państwa) and, later, President of the Republic. It was plain red emblazoned with the crowned White Eagle and bordered with a wężyk generalski, a wavy line used in the Polish military as a symbol of general's rank. It was modified on December 27, 1927 to reflect the adoption of a new official rendering of the national coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{used only}} by the Navy, {{the use of these}} rank flags was {{extended}} in 2005 to all branches of the Armed Forces by an amendment to the relevant ministerial ordinance. They are flown to mark the presence and pay respect to the highest civilian and military authorities: the President of <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poland</b> who is ex officio commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces; the Minister of National Defence who acts on the commander-in-chief's behalf in peacetime; Marshal of Poland, the highest rank in the Polish army (no living holders since 1989); and the Chief of the General Staff.|$|E
5|$|Polish Flag Day (formally: Flag of <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poland</b> Day, Dzień Flagi Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej) {{was first}} {{observed}} on May 2, 2004. It {{was established in}} order to educate the Polish people about the history and significance of national symbols. The date was chosen {{to coincide with the}} Polonia Day traditionally observed by the Polish diaspora outside Poland and the Polish Senate on May 2. There was also a historical reason: under the Communist regime, May 2 was a day when national flags, hoisted for Labor Day on May 1 were being quickly removed before Polish Constitution Day (May 3), which was banned by the authorities.|$|E

5|$|The {{communist}} Polish United Workers' Party dissolved {{itself in}} 1990 and {{transformed into the}} Social Democracy of <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poland.</b> The Warsaw Pact was formally dissolved on 1 July 1991; the Soviet Union ceased to exist in December 1991 and the last post-Soviet troops left Poland in September 1993. On 27 October 1991, the first entirely free Polish parliamentary elections since the 1920s took place. This completed Poland's transition from a communist party rule to a Western-style liberal democratic political system.|$|E
5|$|In June 1970, Jagielski was {{appointed}} as a Deputy Prime Minister (thus ending {{his tenure as}} the Minister of Agriculture and becoming the Deputy of the Council of Ministers of <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poland),</b> and in December 1971 he became a full member of the Politburo of the Polish United Workers' Party (he was previously a deputy to an existing member). On 26 October 1971, he became the Chairman of the Planning Committee of the Council of Ministers. On 23 October 1975, he was relieved of his post as Chairman of the Planning Committee after he suffered a severe heart attack. From 1971 to 1981 he was the Polish representative in the Comecon. In February 1981 he became {{the president of the}} Economy Committee at the Council of Ministers.|$|E
5|$|On March 13, the Polish {{government}} {{issued a}} threatening statement accusing Lithuania of provocation. On the following day, the Senate of <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poland</b> {{called for the}} establishment of diplomatic relations and for the Lithuanian renunciation of claims to Vilnius. Upon receiving news that Poland was considering extreme measures, President Smetona was verging towards agreeing to discuss diplomatic relations, but changed his mind at almost the last minute. On the night of March 14, the Lithuanians, acting through France's envoy to Warsaw, proposed a commission to investigate the shooting incident and to agree on measures to avoid such incidents in the future. This was a partial measure that clearly did not satisfy Poland, which responded by refusing, in the first paragraph of the ultimatum delivered three days later, to establish such a commission. At the same time Lithuanian diplomats approached foreign powers in a bid for international support.|$|E
