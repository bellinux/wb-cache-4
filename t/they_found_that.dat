5|$|At the college, Morris met fellow first-year {{undergraduate}} Edward Burne-Jones, {{who became}} his lifelong friend and collaborator. Although from very different backgrounds, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{they had a}} shared attitude to life, both being keenly interested in Anglo-Catholicism and Arthurianism.|$|E
5|$|Mayfly {{phylogeny}} {{was further}} studied using morphological and molecular analyses by Ogden {{and others in}} 2009. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the Asian genus Siphluriscus was sister to all other mayflies. Some existing lineages such as Ephemeroidea, and families such as Ameletopsidae, were found not to be monophyletic, through convergence among nymphal features.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} Polman, Pollmann, and Poehlman found that sharing {{initials}} with members {{in a group}} can increase the quality of group work. In a study ofundergraduatestudents <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> groups sharing initials performed better than groups that did not. Groups that had {{a higher proportion of}} shared initials exceeded groups with a lower proportion of shared initials.|$|E
50|$|What <b>they</b> <b>found</b> was <b>that</b> {{when the}} buyer {{actively}} {{sought out the}} supplier it reduced conflict between the relationship manager and the potential buyer. In {{a random sample of}} 1600 they took from buyers and suppliers, <b>they</b> also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the majority of businesses actually had a policy for reverse marketing.|$|R

5|$|Black Hawk was {{determined}} to hold onto Saukenuk, where he lived and had been born. When the Sauks returned to the village in 1829 after their annual winter hunt in the west, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> it had been occupied by white squatters who were anticipating the sale of land. After months of clashes with the squatters, the Sauks left in September 1829 for the next winter hunt. Hoping to avoid further confrontations, Keokuk told Forsyth {{that he and his}} followers would not return to Saukenuk.|$|E
5|$|British and European audiences {{typically}} followed {{concert hall}} behaviour protocols associated with classical music performances, {{and they were}} more reserved in their behaviour than were audiences of other forms of rock. This confused musicians during US tours, as <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> American audiences were less attentive and more prone to outbursts during quiet passages.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{also found}} that the deicing {{procedures}} at LaGuardia were substandard. While the jet encountered a delay of up to 35 minutes, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the deicing fluid that was being used at the airport, and by the majority of commercial airlines across the United States, was effective for only fifteen minutes. The accident led to a number of studies into the effect that ice has on aircraft, and several recommendations into prevention techniques.|$|E

5|$|Jaeger and Wiley, in 2015, {{looked at}} readers' ability {{to monitor their}} own comprehension. Their study used a science text as {{the base of a}} lesson and {{decorative}} images as the seductive details. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> readers were less able to monitor their own comprehension of the text when the text was sprinkled with decorative images.|$|E
5|$|Later in 2009, Goodman {{and colleagues}} {{described}} two more species of M.manavi-like Malagasy Miniopterus: M.brachytragos from northern Madagascar and M.mahafaliensis from the southwest. On {{the basis of}} cytochrome b sequences, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> M.aelleni was most closely related to a clade of M.brachytragos, M.manavi, and another recently described Malagasy species, M.petersoni. The five recognized species of M.manavi-like bats are not each other's closest relatives, but apparently acquired their similarities through convergent evolution. At some places (for example, Namoroka) four cryptic species of M.manavi-like bats, including M.aelleni, occur together.|$|E
5|$|Naughty Dog began {{developing}} The Last of Us: Left Behind {{following the}} release of The Last of Us in June 2013, with a team about half the size. Following the decision to create single-player downloadable content for the game, the development team immediately decided that the story would focus {{on the character of}} Ellie; <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> players of The Last of Us were interested to learn about events in Ellie's life prior to the events of the main game, particularly the events involving Riley Abel, whom Ellie mentioned in The Last of Us. In addition, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> some players were interested in the events that occurred between the Fall and Winter segments of the main game, in which Ellie cares for an injured Joel. This led to the team deciding to contrast these two events against each other, feeling it would help the story's pacing. Game director Bruce Straley said that the team felt the story justified the development of Left Behind.|$|E

5|$|Radial {{velocity}} measurements {{revealed the}} existence of a planet with a mass of at least 7 Earths. This planet, GJ 3634 b, became the first planet to be discovered under the new strategy. The team of astronomers then followed up with transit measurements using instruments on the Spitzer Space Telescope; <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> there was most likely no transit event present at the star, but they were able to discover its true mass. GJ 3634 b was published to the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics on February 8, 2011.|$|E
5|$|The Aristotle project, a multi-year {{initiative}} by Google Inc. {{aimed at}} defining {{the characteristics of}} an ideal team in the workplace, has found somewhat similar conditions for group effectiveness. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> by far, most important factor is psychological safety. The other key factors in productivity are dependability, structure and clarity, personal meaning, and each team member feeling like they have an impact.|$|E
5|$|The Pipeline Hazardous Material Safety Administration (PHMSA) is {{responsible}} for developing and enforcing regulations for pipeline operation transportation having been created in 2004 within the United States Department of Transportation. In the months following the spill, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the in-line inspection tool used by Plains in Line 901 and Line 903 had miscalculated the degree of corrosion. The company also withheld in-line inspection data so “it could enhance its interpretation of the data,” according to a corrective order issued by PHMSA. In October, PHMSA proposed new rules to assist in preventing such inspection discrepancies.|$|E
30|$|According to Gonçalves et al. experiments, a {{magnetic}} field was found {{having an impact on}} the paraffin crystal formation, since it avoided the formation of paraffin cluster (Gonçalves et al. 2010). <b>They</b> <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> under a 0.3  T magnetic field, the crystallization was lower than that without the effect of {{a magnetic}} field. However, <b>they</b> also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> rheological changes in crude oil due to magnetic fields exposure is strongly dependent on the crude constitution (Gonçalves et al. 2011).|$|R

5|$|The {{game was}} first {{revealed}} by Atari at the Games Convention 2008. The game was poorly received after its release; video game critics gave it an aggregated score of 49% at Metacritic. Reviewers {{generally agreed that}} presenting a cooking guide as a video game was a good idea, but <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the game was poorly executed and mediocre as a result.|$|E
5|$|They used a {{cladistic}} {{analysis to}} examine its relationships within Oryzomyini, also including {{two species of}} Holochilus, Lundomys, and five other oryzomyines. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Noronhomys appeared closest to Holochilus, with Lundomys more distantly related. Eighteen shared characters (synapomorphies) supported the grouping of Noronhomys with Holochilus. Another form described as a species of Holochilus, Holochilus primigenus, may also be related, but is likely to fall outside the Holochilus–Noronhomys clade.|$|E
5|$|To be an {{automatic}} process, the effect should, for each specific person, be fairly stable over time. Koole, Dijksterhuis and van Knippenberg investigated this by asking Dutch students to rate each {{letter of the}} alphabet, together with some filler questions for distraction, twice within a four-week period. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> preferences for name letters did not significantly change {{between the first and}} second rating. Hoorens and colleagues also found that ratings remained stable when 164 subjects rated letters seven days in a row.|$|E

50|$|In 2001, the {{ichthyologist}} John Ernest Randall and {{his wife}} Helen Randall reviewed all nominal flagtail species from the Pacific Ocean. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> two species had been lumped together under Kuhlia sandvicensis, one {{of which had been}} misidentified as the freshwater K. marginata by some authors (the true K. sandvicensis). <b>They</b> <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> specimens of the common flagtail species from the Hawaiian Islands misidentified as K. sandvicensis matched the description of Xenichthys xenurus and thus Kuhlia xenura became the correct name for one of the two flagtail species from Hawaii.|$|R
5|$|With the {{description}} of Skorpiovenator in 2008, Canale et al. published another phylogenetic analysis focusing on the South American abelisaurids. In their results, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> all South American forms, including Ilokelesia (except Abelisaurus), grouped together as a sub-clade of carnotaurines, which they named Brachyrostra. In the same year Matthew T. Carrano and Scott D. Sampson published new large phylogenetic analysis of ceratosaurian. With {{the description}} of Eoabelisaurus, Diego Pol and Oliver W. M. Rauhut (2012) combined these analyses and added ten new characters. The following cladogram follows their analysis.|$|E
5|$|A 2003 {{episode of}} Discovery Channel's Unsolved History used modern {{technology}} {{to attempt to}} re-enact the gunfight. They utilized a movie set to recreate a space similar to the lot where the original gun fight took place. They confirmed that the front-to-back wrist wound suffered by Billy Clanton could only have occurred if his arm {{was raised in the}} manner of one holding a pistol, and that the black powder may have obscured the shooters' view of each other. The episode concluded that the three eyewitnesses for the prosecution (Sheriff Behan, Ike Clanton, and Billy Clanton) likely offered perjured testimony. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Tom McLaury may have been hit by the shotgun round under his armpit as he reached over his horse for a rifle in his scabbard, as the horse turned away from him at the same time.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} Dutch were winning the action, but after {{they put in}} {{disorder}} two or three Spanish squadrons, Paulo Emilio Martinengo charged ahead his company on their flank and in turn routed a Dutch squadron, which allowed Córdoba to regroup his troops and renew the attack, this time with success. Despite the stubborn resistance offered by the Dutch troops, they were finally broken and fled in a disorderly fashion, attempting to save themselves before the Lippe river. Córdoba sent his cavalry to follow them up, and <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> some of the Dutch soldiers, having {{been unable to find}} a good place to ford the river, had drowned. The Spanish captives were freed, and the spoils taken by the Dutch recovered.|$|E
