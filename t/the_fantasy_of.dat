5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. <b>The</b> <b>fantasy</b> <b>of</b> a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl {{in the way that they}} relate to their grandparents.|$|E

500|$|Lacking the {{financial}} resources of industry leaders MGM, Paramount, Warner Bros./First National and Fox, RKO turned out many pictures during the era that made up for it with high style in an Art Deco mode, exemplified by such Astaire–Rogers musicals as The Gay Divorcee (1934), their first pairing as leads, and Top Hat (1935). One of the figures most responsible for this was creative Van Nest Polglase, chief of RKO's highly regarded design department for almost a decade. Film historian James Naremore has described RKO as [...] "chiefly a designer's studio. It never had a stable of important actors, writers, or directors, but ... it was rich in artists and special-effects technicians. As a result, its most distinctive pictures contained a strong element of fantasy—not so much <b>the</b> <b>fantasy</b> <b>of</b> horror, which during the thirties was the province of Universal, but <b>the</b> <b>fantasy</b> <b>of</b> the marvelous and adventurous." ...|$|E

This sentiment was echoed in The Queen: The Lady's Newspaper, with the reviewer pronouncing that [...] "this is a tale {{in the hands of a}} writer not so able as Mr. Haggard might easily have become absurd; but he has treated it with so much vividness and picturesque power as to invest it with unflagging interest, and given to the mystery a port of philosophic possibility that makes us quite willing to submit to the illusion.|$|E

[...] "No," [...] he said, [...] "because we're doing the Jack Kirby/Stan Lee/Walt Simonson/J. Michael Straczynski Thor. We're not doing the blow-the-dust-off-of-the-old-Norse-book-in-your-library Thor. And in the Thor of the Marvel Universe, there's a race called the Asgardians. And we're linked through this Tree of Life that we're unaware of. It's real science, but we don't know about it yet. The 'Thor' movie is about teaching people that". In March, it was reported that Penn had completed the first draft of the script, and that Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada and Avengers comic-book writer Brian Michael Bendis had received copies. Also in March, Chris Evans accepted an offer to play Captain America in three films including The Avengers.|$|E
500|$|American author Jennifer Roberson {{was known}} for writing fantasy novels before she moved into {{historical}} fiction, a genre new to her. She noted, [...] "One thing I'd always wanted to try–another ‘someday’ dream– was a big, sprawling, mainstream historical epic." [...] She proposed to her literary agent that she write a reinterpretation of the Robin Hood legend {{from the perspective of}} Maid Marian. Roberson understood that her rendition was not a [...] "recounting" [...] of the original story, because [...] "there is none"; rather, Lady of the Forest was [...] "purely [...] own concoction." [...] Describing the novel as a prequel, the author explained, [...] "I wanted very much to write the story of how the legend came to be; the tale of how seven very different people from a rigidly stratified social structure came to join together to fight the inequities of medieval England. To me, the key was logic—I interwove historical fact with <b>the</b> <b>fantasy</b> <b>of</b> the classic legend, and developed my own interpretation of how things came to be. I wanted to come to know all of these people; to climb inside their heads and learn what motivated them to do what they did." ...|$|E
500|$|Ray Muzyka, {{co-founder of}} BioWare, {{said that the}} team wanted to try {{something}} that would be new but familiar to most players. They hoped that Origins would redefine the genre to become The Lord of the Rings of video game franchises. Greg Zeschuk, another co-founder of BioWare, described <b>the</b> <b>fantasy</b> <b>of</b> Dragon Age as in between the high fantasy of J. R. R. Tolkien's works and the low fantasy of works by George R.R. Martin. The goal was a [...] "dark heroic fantasy" [...] that would suit the taste of any fan of the genre. Thus, while the game has the typical races of human, elf, and dwarf, they are slightly altered from the usual nature of the three races, and a new lizard-like race called the Qunari was introduced. Some of the alterations they made included flipping how certain races, like elves, are treated in other fictional worlds. While elves are often described as a race of high prestige in fiction, Dragon Age: Origins presents them as slaves of humans, labelled as second class citizens who resent the human race. This extended to the gameplay, where the player can choose to discriminate against other races, and can experience discrimination from others based on their choices.|$|E
