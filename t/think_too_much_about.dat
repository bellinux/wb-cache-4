500|$|The Chicago Tribunes Sid Smith {{found the}} film to be [...] "pretty lousy, despite a wealth of {{impressive}} special effects that end with {{an image of a}} completely demolished Chicago skyline." [...] He found the plot to be overly melodramatic and [...] "hokey" [...] with an excessive amount of coincidences and ill-fortunes thrown at the characters, despite the performances of the star-studded cast. Australia's The Age gave the film a slightly more favorable review, praising the stunts and special effects, though it noted the effects suffer from poor computer editing and referred to the film as [...] "a little entertaining supertrash" [...] that does require one to not <b>think</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the science to enjoy.|$|E
500|$|Before Other Ms development, Sakamoto did not <b>think</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> [...] "what kind {{of person}} Samus Aran was and how she thinks and her personality", {{particularly}} because the games tried to depict Samus as a mysterious person. Sakamoto and Team Ninja put much focus on backstory in the game to present Samus as an [...] "appealing human character", something important for future installments, as players would get further interest in Samus' adventures. Hayashi {{said that one of}} the development team's goals was to have the player [...] "connect with Samus as the story and action develops". Sakamoto also said the game would [...] "bring everyone up to the same level of understanding in the Metroid universe", and would not only introduce the series to new players but also create new challenges for fans. The chronological setting between Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion was chosen because Sakamoto considered the period [...] "so critical that without addressing it, we wouldn't be able to make new games that show Samus' adventures that take place after the events of Metroid Fusion".|$|E

You cannot think about how much {{you want to win}} without the mind automatically generating defeat as a possibility, and that creates fear.

I believe that she has only one fault, and it is that she <b>thinks</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> me. Uncle said that he had told you how we came here first when I was eight years old. Well, I {{remember}} that when we lost our way on the veldt that night, and it rained so and was so cold, Jess took off her own shawl and wrapped it round me over my own. Well, it has been just like that with her always. I am always to have the shawl--everything is to give way to me. But there, that is Jess all over; she is very cold, cold as a stone I sometimes think, but when she does care for anybody it is enough to frighten one. I don't know a great number of women, but somehow I do not think that there can be many in the world like Jess. She is too good for this place; she ought to go away to England and write books and become a famous woman, only----" [...] she added reflectively, [...] "I am afraid that Jess's books would all be sad ones." ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the final}} game of the month Vancouver played the Rangers and former coach Alain Vigneault. Daniel Sedin said of the game: [...] "I know our former coach is over there, but once you get into the game you're not going to <b>think</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it. He was with us for seven years and he meant a lot to this franchise, so it's going to be fun seeing him again but once the game gets going we want the two points, and so does he". Tortarella stated: [...] "I'm not going to lie, it's a little weird for me coming back, but once the game starts, it's about playing and {{trying to find a way}} to get a win". The Canucks lost the game 5–2, {{finishing}} the month with 31 points, four points out of the final playoff spot.|$|E

Of her {{experience}} of the relay, she said: They began lunging towards me, trying to grab the torch from my hands. I tried to hide the torch with my body and managed {{to keep it from}} them. I was focused on the three or four separatists attacking me. I'm not sure how many were behind me. I felt people trying to take the torch from me. That's when some of the escort runners , as well as the tourist guide assigned to me in Paris, came over to help me, drawing the attackers away. People ask me how I dealt with the danger. I don't <b>think</b> I thought <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it. I trusted the escorts around me. They were the ones, along with my guide, that faced the danger.|$|R
2500|$|While Evans {{considered}} himself an acoustic pianist, from the 1970 album From Left to Right on, he also released some material with Fender-Rhodes piano intermissions. However, unlike other jazz players (e.g. Herbie Hancock) he never fully embraced the new instrument, and invariably ended up {{returning to the}} acoustic sound. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the electronic thing, except that it's kind of fun to have it as an alternate voice. (...) [...] merely an alternate keyboard instrument, that offers {{a certain kind of}} sound that's appropriate sometimes. I find that it's a refreshing auxiliary to the piano—but I don't need it (...) I don't enjoy {{spending a lot of time}} with the electric piano. I play it for a period of time, then I quickly tire of it, and I want to get back to the acoustic piano." [...] He commented that electronic music: [...] "just doesn't attract me. I'm of a certain period, a certain evolution. I hear music differently. For me, comparing electric bass to acoustic bass is sacrilege." ...|$|E
2500|$|Silvers {{said of the}} editors' philosophy, that [...] "there was no subject we couldn't deal with. And {{if there}} was no book , we would deal with it anyway. We tried hard to avoid books that were simply {{competent}} rehearsals of familiar subjects, and we hoped to find books that would establish something fresh, something original." [...] In particular, [...] "We felt you had to have a political analysis of the nature of power in America – who had it, who was affected". The editors also shared an [...] "intense admiration for wonderful writers". Well-known writers were willing to contribute articles for the initial issues of the Review without pay because it offered them a chance to write a new kind of book review. [...] As Mark Gevisser explained: [...] "The essays ... made the book review form not just a report on the book and a judgment of the book, but an essay in itself. And that, I think, startled everyone – that a book review could be exciting in that way, could be provocative in that way." [...] Early issues included articles by such writers as Hardwick, Lowell, Jason Epstein, Hannah Arendt, W. H. Auden, Saul Bellow, John Berryman, Truman Capote, Paul Goodman, Lillian Hellman, Irving Howe, Alfred Kazin, Dwight Macdonald, Norman Mailer, Mary McCarthy, Norman Podhoretz, Philip Rahv, Adrienne Rich, [...] Susan Sontag, William Styron, Gore Vidal, Robert Penn Warren and Edmund Wilson. [...] The Review pointedly published interviews with European political dissidents, including Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Andrei Sakharov and Václav Havel. But, Silvers noted, it is a mystery whether [...] "reviews have a calculable political and social impact" [...] or will even gain attention: [...] "You mustn't <b>think</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> influence – if you find something interesting yourself, that should be enough." ...|$|E

There was no sign of fear or pain on his face--just the look that he used to have when asleep, patient and a little wearied. [...] "What a stroke his death will be to hundreds!" [...] What his Mission will do without him, God only knows Who has taken him away. His ways are not as our ways. Seeing people taken away, when, as we think, they are almost necessary to do God's work on earth, makes one think that we often <b>think</b> and talk <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> Christian work. What God requires is Christian men. He does not need the work, only gives it to form or perfect the character of the men whom He sends to do it.|$|R
5000|$|After {{ten years}} of {{struggling}} as the Blue Velvets and the Golliwogs, singer/guitarist John Fogerty, his brother guitarist Tom Fogerty, bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford scored a #11 hit single with [...] "Susie Q" [...] in June 1968 under the name Creedence Clearwater Revival. Their self-titled album peaked at #52 on the Billboard albums chart. Despite their new-found success, however, seeds of discontent among the four members had already been planted due to John Fogerty assuming control of the band at just about every level. [...] "There was {{a point at which}} we had done the first album. Everybody had listened to my advice. I don't <b>think</b> anybody thought <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it," [...] Fogerty recalled to Michael Goldberg of Rolling Stone in 1993. [...] "But in making the second album, Bayou Country, we had a real confrontation. Everybody wanted to sing, write, make up their own arrangements, whatever, right? This was after {{ten years of}} struggling. Now we had the spotlight. Andy Warhol's fifteen minutes of fame. 'Suzie Q' was as big as we'd ever seen. Of course, it really wasn't that big...I didn't {{want to go back to}} the carwash." [...] In 2007, the singer elaborated to Joshua Klein of Pitchfork, [...] "I determined, we're on the tiniest record label in the world, there's no money behind us, we don't have a manager, there's no publicist. We basically had none of the usual star-making machinery, so I said to myself I'm just going to have to do it with the music...Basically I wanted to do what the Beatles had done.
