500|$|In the 1980s, {{to further}} {{his career as}} a filmmaker, Pierce moved to Carmel, California, where he met and befriended actor Clint Eastwood. Pierce shared a film {{treatment}} he had developed with Eastwood, who liked the story and helped Pierce develop it into Sudden Impact (1983), the fourth entry in Eastwood's Dirty Harry film series. Pierce was given a writer's credit for the story along with Joseph C. Stinson. Pierce is said to have written the phrase, [...] "Go ahead, make my day," [...] the film's most famous line, which went on to be identified as one of the ten best movie quotes of all-time by the American Film Institute. The phrase was inspired by something his father once told Pierce in his youth while encouraging his son <b>to</b> <b>mow</b> the lawn: [...] "When I come home tonight and the yard has not been mowed, you're going to make my day." [...] However, whether Pierce truly invented the phrase has been brought into question, since the same line was used in the action-drama film Vice Squad (1982) the previous year. Around this time, Pierce also directed Sacred Ground (1983), which was released the same year as Sudden Impact.|$|E

In the Battle of Kolín he commanded the left wing and was then assigned to Duke August Wilhelm Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel-Bevern, who was given the command in Silesia. On 24 November 1757, he led the rest of the army past Glogau to Liegnitz to join Frederick's army; he subsequently distinguished himself in the Battle of Leuthen on 5 December, [...] by helping <b>to</b> <b>mow</b> down the Austrian left flank.

Thirty-three randomly selected farms (preventive group) set simple scaring devices in order to reduce fawn mortality, whereas the rest of the farms (control group) did not set any scaring devices. The scaring device consisted of a black sack attached to a 1. 80 m long pole. These poles had to be placed in a field that was about <b>to</b> be <b>mown</b> 24 hours before mowing, one pole per hectare. During our research 13 roe deer fawns were killed by mowers. The highest rate of mortality was perceived in the beginning {{and in the middle of}} June, that is 4. 5 fawns per 100 ha. Twelve fawns were killed by tractor mowers and one by a sickle mower. The control group suffered a loss of 3. 3 fawns per 100 ha of mowed meadows and the preventive group 2 fawns per 100 ha. Our conclusion was that simple scaring devices had decreased the mortality rate of roe deer fawns, but to a lesser degree than expected, though it is true that the farmers did not always set the scaring devices according to our instructions...|$|R

40|$|Traditional grasslands {{are often}} of high {{conservation}} value, but depend on non-intensive management like mowing for their preservation. During the 20 th century, traditional agricultural usage was either heavily intensified or abandoned due to socio-economic reasons. In Eastern Europe, land abandonment mainly {{took place in}} regions with qualitatively bad soils. This large scale land use change lead to secondary succession. In fens and fen meadows, this {{may lead to a}} decrease in species richness and a replacement of specialist species by more generalist ones. The main objective of the present study is to examine if and how mowing cessation interacts with hydrology in determining species and trait distribution in a fen meadow. In the Upper Course of the Biebrza National Park, Poland, we selected 15 sites along four transects, with plots in mown and abandoned parcels. In these plots we measured plant abundance, aboveground biomass and relative light intensity, while plant traits were selected from different trait databases. The relationship between these plot characteristics and the different traits was assessed using concordance analysis. Mowing cessation resulted in reduced moss cover and light availability, while vegetation height increased and higher litter deposition and tussock development were observed. This altered environment not only resulted in decreased species richness and evenness in abandoned plots but also caused shifts in plant trait distribution. Most of the significantly linked traits responded more strongly <b>to</b> <b>mowing</b> cessation than <b>to</b> the hydrologic gradient. Traits related to light competition, such as light requirements, plant height and shoot growth form, especially responded <b>to</b> <b>mowing</b> cessation. This stresses the importance of light competition as a major factor determining species and trait distribution in fen systems. ...|$|R

All treatments were executed prior <b>to</b> <b>mowing</b> the turf at the new reduced height of 1 / 8 ". Significant treatment effects resulted from combinations of mowing and rolling for ball speed distance, when averaged over three evaluation dates. When averaged over all three evaluation dates, the single mow/no roll treatment [1 x mow/ 0 roll] had the least ball roll distance (BRD) values.

40|$|Background: Mowing is {{a widely}} adopted {{management}} practice for the semiarid steppe in China and affects CH 4 exchange. However, the magnitude and the underlying mechanisms for CH 4 uptake in response <b>to</b> <b>mowing</b> remain uncertain. Methodology/Principal Findings: In two consecutive growing seasons, we measured the effect of mowing on CH 4 uptake in a steppe community. Vegetation was <b>mowed</b> <b>to</b> 2 cm (M 2), 5 cm (M 5), 10 cm (M 10), 15 cm (M 15) above soil surface, respectively, and control was set as non-mowing (NM). Compared with control, CH 4 uptake was substantially enhanced at almost all the mowing treatments except for M 15 plots of 2009. CH 4 uptake was significantly correlated with soil microbial biomass carbon, microbial biomass nitrogen, and soil moisture. Mowing affects CH 4 uptake primarily through its effect on some biotic factors, such as net primary productivity, soil microbial C supply and soil microbial activities, while soil temperature and moisture were less important. Conclusions/Significance: This study found that mowing affects the fluxes of CH 4 in the semiarid temperate steppe of north China...|$|R
