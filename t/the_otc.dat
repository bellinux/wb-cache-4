40|$|The {{effects of}} {{elevated}} CO 2 were studied on the photosynthetic gas exchange behaviour and leaf physiology of two contrasting poplar (Populus) hybrids grown and treated in open top chambers (OTCs in Antwerp, Belgium) and in closed glasshouse cabinets (GHCs in Sussex, UK). The CO 2 concentrations used in <b>the</b> <b>OTCs</b> were ambient and ambient + 350 µmol mol– 1 {{while in the}} GHCs they were c. 360 µmol mol– 1 versus 719 µmol mol– 1. Measurements of photosynthetic gas exchange were made for euramerican and interamerican poplar hybrids in combination with measurements of dark respiration rate and Rubisco activity. Significant differences in the leaf anatomy and structure (leaf mass per area and chlorophyll content) were observed between the leaves grown in <b>the</b> <b>OTCs</b> and those grown in the GHCs. Elevated CO 2 stimulated net photosynthesis in the poplar hybrids after 1 month in the GHCs and after 4 months in <b>the</b> <b>OTCs,</b> {{and there was no}} evidence of downward acclimation (or down-regulation) of photosynthesis when the plants in the two treatments were measured in their growth CO 2 concentration. There was also no evidence of down-regulation of Rubisco activity and there were even examples of increases in Rubisco activity. Rubisco exerted a strong control over the light-saturated rate of photosynthesis, which was demonstrated by the close agreement between observed net photosynthetic rates and those that were predicted from Rubisco activities and Michaelis-Menten kinetics. After 17 months in elevated CO 2 in <b>the</b> <b>OTCs</b> there was a significant loss of Rubisco activity for one of the hybrid clones, i. e. Beaupré, but not for clone Robusta. The effect of the CO 2 measurement concentration (i. e. the short-term treatment effect) on net photosynthesis was always larger than the effect of the growth concentration in both <b>the</b> <b>OTCs</b> or GHCs (i. e. the longterm growth CO 2 effect), with one exception. For the interamerican hybrid Beaupré dark respiration rates in <b>the</b> <b>OTCs</b> were not significantly affected by the elevated CO 2 concentrations. The results suggest that for rapidly growing tree species, such as poplars, there is little evidence for downward acclimation of photosynthesis when plants are exposed to elevated CO 2 for up to 4 months; longer term exposure reveals loss of Rubisco activity...|$|R

40|$|A {{bioactive}} N,N-diacetylglycine (NNDAG) and new organotin(IV) complexes (OTCs) (1 - 7) were synthesized. Spectroscopic {{techniques were}} employed to characterize NNDAG and OTCs. FTIR was employed to verify N,N protection of glycine by acetyl groups. The disappearance of υ(OH) at 3000 - 2600 cm- 1 showed de-protonation of free ligand. The Δυ 150 < 200 cm- 1 of OTCs 4 - 7 verified bidentate coordination with tetrahedral geometry. <b>The</b> Δυ of <b>OTCs</b> 1 and 3 was < 200 cm- 1 exhibitingtrans -octahedral geometry while OTC 2 dimer was assigned a unique sinusoidal view. The 1 H NMR spectra of OTCs verified their synthesis by de-protonation of NNDAG and no chemical shift was found downfield for carboxylic acid proton. The 13 C, 119 Sn NMR and Mass spectrometric data also supported FTIR and 1 H NMR descriptions. <b>The</b> <b>OTCs</b> 4, 5, 6 and 7 (500 ppm) proved twice as active against Escherichia coli as the standard antibiotic enoxacin (1000 ppm). The promising property of <b>the</b> <b>OTCs</b> (4, 5, 6 and 7) is clearly due to their tetrahedral. <b>The</b> <b>OTCs</b> 4 and 5 exhibited excellent activity against M. minimum and good activity against T. castaneum.

40|$|Studies of {{cryptogam}} {{responses to}} climate change in the polar regions are scarce because these slow-growing organisms require long-term monitoring studies. Here, we analyse the response of a lichen and moss community to 10 years of passive environmental manipulation using open-top chambers (<b>OTCs)</b> in <b>the</b> maritime Antarctic region. Cover of the dominant lichen Usnea antarctica declined by 71 % in <b>the</b> <b>OTCs.</b> However, less dominant lichen species showed no significant responses except {{for an increase in}} Ochrolechia frigida, which typically covered dying lichen and moss vegetation. There were no detectable responses in the moss or associated micro-arthropod communities to the influence of <b>the</b> <b>OTCs.</b> Based on calculated respiration rates, we hypothesise that the decline of U. antarctica was most likely caused by increased net winter respiration rates (11 %), driven by the higher temperatures and lower light levels experienced inside <b>the</b> <b>OTCs</b> as a result of greater snow accumulation. During summer, U. antarctica appears unable to compensate for this increased carbon loss, leading to a negative carbon balance on an annual basis, and the lichen therefore appears to be vulnerable to such climate change simulations. These findings indicate that U. antarctica dominated fell-fields may change dramatically if current environmental change trends continue in the maritime Antarctic, especially if associated with increases in winter snow depth or duration...|$|R
