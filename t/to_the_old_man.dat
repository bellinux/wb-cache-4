2500|$|Ring 3: Against God, Art, and Nature: The {{third round}} of the seventh circle is a great Plain of Burning Sand {{scorched}} by great flakes of flame falling slowly down from the sky, an image derived from the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 19:24.) The Blasphemers (the Violent against God) are stretched supine upon the burning sand, the Sodomites (the Violent against Nature) run in circles, while the Usurers (the Violent against Art, which is the Grandchild of God, as explained in Canto XI) crouch huddled and weeping. Ciardi writes, [...] "Blasphemy, sodomy, and usury are all unnatural and sterile actions: thus the unbearing desert is the eternity of these sinners; and thus the rain, which in nature should be fertile and cool, descends as fire". Dante finds Capaneus {{stretched out on the}} sands; for blasphemy against Jove, he was struck down with a thunderbolt during the Siege of Thebes; he is still scorning Jove in the afterlife. The overflow of Phlegethon, the river of blood from the First Round, flows boiling through the Wood of the Suicides (the second round) and crosses the Burning Plain. Virgil explains the origin of the rivers of Hell, which includes references <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> of Crete.|$|E

Bowers and I went to Kaufman’s store to get the money and Van Triplett and Foster {{remained}} behind. We came back with the dust and I unrolled it and showed them the sack, and the old man {{said he did not know}} if that was gold, and Bowers said, ‘Open it and show it to him, as he don’t know gold dust when he sees it,’ but I did not open it, and [...] just about to roll it up again, when Foster grabbed it and handing it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> said, “Git!” and I started to grab the old man when they held me and said if I made a noise it would not be well for me.
