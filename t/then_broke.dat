5|$|After {{missing the}} Australian {{victory in the}} Second Test due to injury, Meckiff {{returned}} for the Third Test and he was again attacked, taking 1/74 from 13 overs in the first innings, his sole victim being Conrad Hunte. He <b>then</b> <b>broke</b> down after five overs in the second innings. Davidson also left the field with injury and the tourists took advantage; they attacked the remaining bowlers, levelling the series 1–1. The Victorian did not recover {{in time for the}} rest of the Tests.|$|E
5|$|After the match, which Galatasaray won 4–1 on penalties, {{approximately}} 300 Arsenal {{fans in the}} Finsbury Park area of Islington in London attacked Turkish {{restaurants and}} businesses, with bottles being used to break windows. They <b>then</b> <b>broke</b> into an apartment building to threaten Kosovan refugees with a knife, mistakenly believing them to be Turkish. Six people were arrested and three Metropolitan Police officers were injured. In Turkey, nine people were accidentally shot and injured by Galatasaray fans firing guns in celebration despite police warning them not to.|$|E
5|$|Against Osasuna on 17 September 2011, Villa contributed {{two goals}} and forced Rovérsio into scoring an own goal in Barcelona's 8–0 {{win over the}} team from Pamplona. He <b>then</b> <b>broke</b> his tibia in a Club World Cup match in Yokohama against Al Sadd. Doctors said {{he was to be}} out of action for up to six months, but this {{eventually}} led to him missing the entire 2011–12 season with both Barcelona and the Spanish football team at Euro 2012.|$|E
60|$|There was a pause. <b>Then</b> Ursula <b>broke</b> into faltering challenge.|$|R
60|$|There {{was another}} brief, almost stupefied silence. <b>Then</b> Laura <b>broke</b> into speech.|$|R
60|$|They {{looked at}} each other, and <b>then</b> they <b>broke</b> into a happy laugh.|$|R
5|$|An {{argument}} <b>then</b> <b>broke</b> {{out between}} Tyler {{and some of}} the royal servants. The Mayor of London, William Walworth, stepped forward to intervene, Tyler made some motion towards the King, and the royal soldiers leapt in. Either Walworth or Richard ordered Tyler to be arrested, Tyler attempted to attack the Mayor, and Walworth responded by stabbing Tyler. Ralph Standish, a royal squire, then repeatedly stabbed Tyler with his sword, mortally injuring him.|$|E
5|$|At 11 am a {{disturbance}} {{started in the}} chapel at Strangeways Prison when some 300 prisoners attacked staff. Those prisoners then gained access to the chapel roof and <b>then</b> <b>broke</b> into the living accommodation in the main prison. Other prisoners, including those on remand, joined in the disturbance and staff had to be withdrawn. The perimeter is secure.|$|E
5|$|Continents formed, <b>then</b> <b>broke</b> up and {{reformed}} as {{the surface}} of Earth reshaped over {{hundreds of millions of}} years, occasionally combining to make a supercontinent. Roughly 750million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia which broke apart about 540million years ago, then finally Pangaea, which broke apart about 180million years ago.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> he <b>broke</b> {{out at a}} {{new place}} {{in a tone of}} {{detached}} criticism.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> they <b>broke</b> {{and fled}} {{this way and}} that, {{screaming}} curses as they went.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> Farquhar <b>broke</b> in, and Alison {{recognized}} {{that he meant}} to follow his wife's lead.|$|R
5|$|Despite this form, his Test {{campaign}} started poorly with an ineffective 1/130 in the drawn First Test at Edgbaston. He <b>then</b> <b>broke</b> {{down with}} a back injury in a match against Kent and looked unlikely to play. With Benaud already sidelined with a shoulder injury, Australia looked severely weakened without their two main bowlers. Despite again complaining about frailties of his body, Davidson vowed to play and produce a special performance for friend and stand-in captain Neil Harvey in the Second Test at Lord's.|$|E
5|$|In 1533, Henry <b>then</b> <b>broke</b> with Pope Paul III {{in order}} to annul the long-standing {{marriage}} to his wife, Catherine of Aragon and remarry. Catherine was the aunt of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, {{and he took the}} annulment as a personal insult. This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England. An invasion of England now appeared certain.|$|E
5|$|The Bible {{may contain}} an early account of rhabdomyolysis. In , the Pentateuch {{says that the}} Jews demanded meat while {{traveling}} in the desert; God sent quail {{in response to the}} complaints, and people ate large quantities of quail meat. A plague <b>then</b> <b>broke</b> out, killing numerous people. Rhabdomyolysis after consuming quail was described in more recent times and called coturnism (after Coturnix, the main quail genus). Migrating quail consume large amounts of hemlock, a known cause of rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> Lovell <b>broke</b> silence. He {{took his}} pipe from his mouth, and he {{addressed}} Aynesworth.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> he <b>broke</b> into {{a violent}} sobbing. Dick knelt by his side, {{and took his}} hand.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a rather}} tense {{silence for a moment}} or two, and <b>then</b> Hawtrey <b>broke</b> it.|$|R
5|$|A minor Army-Air Force fight <b>then</b> <b>broke</b> {{out about}} what targets {{would be used}} for the Kwajalein tests. The Army favored using its Jupiter design, fired from Johnston Atoll in the Pacific, while the Air Force {{recommended}} using Atlas fired from Vandenberg AFB in California. The Army had already begun converting the former Thor launchers to Jupiter when an Ad Hoc Panel formed by the Department of Defense considered the issue. On 26 May 1960 they decided in favor of Atlas, and this was made official on 29 June when the Secretary of Defense ended pad conversion and additional Jupiter production earmarked for Zeus testing.|$|E
5|$|Alabama's post-touchdown kickoff {{sailed through}} the end zone for a touchback, and Tech's offense started at its 20-yard line. Stith ran ahead for a five-yard gain on first down, <b>then</b> <b>broke</b> free on second down for a 38-yard run to the Alabama 36-yard line. Once there, Clark threw an {{incomplete}} pass and Ferguson ran for a two-yard gain. On third down, Clark scrambled for a six-yard gain. Facing fourth down, Beamer sent in Graham to attempt a 44-yard field goal. The kick was good, and with 6:41 remaining in the first half, Virginia Tech regained the lead, 107.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2003, Laurer had {{a tumultuous}} {{relationship}} with fellow wrestler Sean Waltman. They were engaged {{for a period}} in 2003, <b>then</b> <b>broke</b> up, and then became engaged again, a pattern that continued {{for the next two}} years. In 2004, Laurer and Waltman made a sex tape. Eager for a repeat success, the company that released Paris Hilton's celebrity sex tape obtained the footage, edited it, and released it under the name 1 Night in China. The video sold over 100,000 copies, with both Laurer and Waltman earning a share of the profits. Laurer, however, maintained that she did not earn any money from the release. In January 2005, Laurer was arrested for domestic assault after allegedly beating Waltman.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> she <b>broke</b> away, {{called a}} low, hurried good-by, and stole {{like a shadow}} into the darkness.|$|R
60|$|He paused, contemplating this definition; <b>then</b> {{suddenly}} <b>broke</b> into horrible laughter--as unnatural and ghastly as a {{laugh in}} hell.|$|R
60|$|The three Miss Smithly-Dubbs {{put down}} their cups of Turkish coffee and stared. <b>Then</b> they <b>broke</b> into protesting giggles.|$|R
5|$|Harvey {{was dropped}} after two matches in 195657, ending his {{first-class}} career. After his playing career was over, Harvey took up umpiring, {{and made his}} first-class debut in 197475. He became a regular official {{over the next few}} seasons and <b>then</b> <b>broke</b> into international umpiring in 197879. In that summer, Harvey stood in two One Day Internationals (ODIs) and one Test. The following season he made his final appearances at international level, presiding over another Test and four ODIs. His last season of top-level domestic umpiring was in 198182 during which he officiated in two matches. He finished his career having presided over 31 first-class and 13 List A matches.|$|E
5|$|Morales' {{second term}} was heavily {{affected}} by infighting and dissent from {{within his own}} support base, as indigenous and leftist activists came to oppose {{a number of the}} governments' reforms. In May 2010, Morales' government announced a 5% rise in the minimum wage. The Bolivian Workers' Central (COB) felt this insufficient given the rise in the cost of living, and called a general strike. Protesters clashed with police, although the government refused to increase the rise, accusing protesters of being pawns of the right. In August 2010, violent protests <b>then</b> <b>broke</b> out in southern Potosí over widespread unemployment and a lack of investment in infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1699, {{other members}} of the Royal Society (of which Newton was a member) accused Leibniz of plagiarism. The dispute <b>then</b> <b>broke</b> out in full force in 1711 when the Royal Society proclaimed in a study that it was Newton who was the true {{discoverer}} and labelled Leibniz a fraud. This study was cast into doubt when it was later found that Newton himself wrote the study's concluding remarks on Leibniz. Thus began the bitter controversy which marred the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the latter's death in 1716.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> he <b>broke</b> {{out in his}} coarse way, {{saying things}} to his {{daughter}} of which {{he should have been}} ashamed.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> he <b>broke</b> {{the silk}} of the seals and read, {{and as he}} read his face grew black with rage.|$|R
6000|$|Bridge made no reply, {{and the two}} trudged {{on toward}} the {{whitewashed}} hut in silence for several minutes. <b>Then</b> Bridge <b>broke</b> it: ...|$|R
5|$|The list reached 20° between 02:05 and 02:30, {{and when}} 'abandon ship' was {{declared}} again at 04:00, had reached 27°. Ark Royals complement had been evacuated to Legion by 04:30; {{with the exception}} of Mitchell, there were no fatalities. The 1,487 officers and crew were transported to Gibraltar. The list reached 45° before Ark Royal capsized and sank at 06:19 on 14 November. Witnesses reported the carrier rolling to 90°, where she remained for three minutes before inverting. Ark Royal <b>then</b> <b>broke</b> in two, the aft sinking within a couple of minutes, followed by the bow.|$|E
5|$|Thomas of Lancaster {{made little}} {{use of his}} new castle; {{the only time he}} might have visited it was in 1319, when {{he was on his way}} north to join Edward's {{military}} campaign against Scotland. Civil war <b>then</b> <b>broke</b> out in 1321 between Edward and his enemies among the barons. After the initial royalist successes, Thomas fled the south of England for Dunstanburgh in 1322, but was intercepted on route by Sir Andrew Harclay, resulting in the Battle of Boroughbridge, in which Thomas was captured; he was later executed.|$|E
5|$|Unrest <b>then</b> <b>broke</b> {{out across}} eastern Bolivia, as radicalized autonomist activists {{established}} blockades, occupied airports, clashing with pro-government demonstrations, police, and armed forces. Some formed paramilitaries, bombing state companies, indigenous NGOs, {{and human rights}} organisations, also launching armed racist attacks on indigenous communities, culminating in the Pando Massacre of MAS activists. The autonomists gained support from some high-ranking politicians; Santa Cruz Governor Rubén Costas lambasted Morales and his supporters with racist epithets, accusing the president of being an Aymara fundamentalist and a totalitarian dictator responsible for state terrorism. Amid the unrest, foreign commentators began speculating {{on the possibility of}} civil war.|$|E
60|$|Opening his notebook, he {{supported}} his claim, {{and there was}} a brief silence when he had finished. <b>Then</b> Florence <b>broke</b> in angrily.|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I--suppose--Oh!" [...] And <b>then</b> Dora <b>broke</b> from Dick's hold, as Fred Garrison and Hans Mueller appeared, {{around a}} {{bend of the}} pathway.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly, with a snake-like motion, {{she seemed}} to slip from his embrace, and <b>then</b> again <b>broke</b> out into her low laugh of triumphant mockery.|$|R
