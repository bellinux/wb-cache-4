40|$|Spinach plants (Spinacea oleracea L. cv. Estivato) {{were grown}} an {{nutrient}} solutions under deficient, normal and excess sulfate supply. In both young and mature plants net uptake of sulfate and its transport <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> increased with increasing sulfate supply, but bath processes proceeded {{at a higher}} rate in young as compared <b>to</b> mature plants. <b>The</b> relative sulfate transport, i. e. the relative amount of the sulfate taken up that is transported <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot,</b> decreased with increasing sulfate supply. Apparently, net uptake of sulfate is not strictly controlled by the sulfur demand of <b>the</b> <b>shoot,</b> but xylem loading appears to counteract excess transport of sulfate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot.</b> Fumigation with H 2 S or SO 2 reduced net uptake of sulfate by the roots in sulfur-deficient plants and absolute as well as relative sulfate transport <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> independent of <b>the</b> three sulfate levels supplied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plant. At the same time thiol contents of <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> and <b>the</b> root were enhanced by fumigation with H 2 S and SO 2.

40|$|In tobacco plants the net uptake of {{sulphate}} and its transport <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> {{were determined}} after cultivation with low, normal, and high sulphate supply. The relative {{amount of the}} sulphate taken up that was transported <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> {{was used as a}} measure of xylem loading. Net uptake of sulphate and its transport <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> were low in tobacco plants grown with low sulphate, and high in plants cultivated with high sulphate. Xylem loading, however, was relatively low in tobacco plants grown with high sulphate and relatively high in tobacco plants grown with low sulphate supply. Pre-culture in low sulphate containing nutrient solution also resulted in a high proportion of the absorbed sulphate being transported into the xylem if normal sulphate concentration was supplied afterwards. Fumigation with H 2 S or SO 2 reduced net uptake of sulphate in tobacco plants grown with normal, but not with high sulphate supply. Sulphate transport <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoots</b> was diminished by H 2 S or SO 2 fumigation in tobacco plants grown with normal and high sulphate supply. Also the relative amount of the sulphate taken up that was transported <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> was lowered by fumigation with H 2 S or SO 2 in tobacco plants grown with normal sulphate supply. Apparently, the diminished sulphate transport <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> upon H 2 S or SO 2 fumigation can only partially be explained by a smaller sulphate uptake. Sulphur nutrition of tobacco plants also seems to be controlled by xylem loading of sulphate. The possible role of glutathione as a signal regulating sulphur nutrition of tobacco plants upon fumigation with H 2 S and SO 2 is discussed...|$|R

5|$|Barry Lyndon (1975) is an {{adaptation}} of William Makepeace Thackeray's The Luck of Barry Lyndon (also known as Barry Lyndon), a picaresque novel about the adventures of an 18th-century Irish rogue and social climber. John Calley of Warner Bros. agreed in 1972 to invest $2.5 million into the film, on condition that Kubrick approach major Hollywood stars, to ensure it of success. Like previous films, Kubrick and his art department conducted {{an enormous amount of}} research, and he went from knowing very little about the 18th century {{at the start of the}} production to becoming an expert on it. Extensive photographs were taken of locations and artwork in particular, and paintings were meticulously replicated from works of the great masters of the period in the film. The film was shot on location in Ardmore, County Waterford, Ireland, beginning in the autumn of 1973, at a cost of $11 million with a cast and crew of 170. The decision to shoot in Ireland stemmed from the fact that it still retained many buildings from the 18th century period which England lacked. The production was problematic from the start, plagued with heavy rain and political strife involving Northern Ireland at the time. After Kubrick received death threats from the IRA in the New Year of 1974 due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> scenes with English soldiers, he fled Ireland with his family on a ferry from Dún Laoghaire under an assumed identity, and filming resumed in England.|$|E

With certain assumption concerning the equilibration of applied [3 H]indole- 3 -acetyl-myo-inositol-[U- 14 C]galactose with the endogenous pool, it may be concluded that indole- 3 -acetyl-myo-inositol galactoside in the endosperm supplies about 2 picomoles per plant per hour of indole- 3 -acetyl-myo-inositol and 1 picomole per plant per hour of indole- 3 -acetic acid <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> and thus is comparable to indole- 3 -acetyl-myo-inositol {{as a source of}} indole-acetic acid for <b>the</b> <b>shoot.</b> Quantitative estimates of the amount of galactose in the kernels suggest that [3 H]indole- 3 -acetyl-myo-inositol-[14 C]galactose is hydrolyzed after the compound leaves the endosperm but before it reaches <b>the</b> <b>shoot.</b> In addition, [3 H]indole- 3 -acetyl-myo-inositol-[14 C]galactose supplies appreciable amounts of 14 C <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> and both 14 C and 3 H to an uncharacterized insoluble fraction of the endosperm...|$|R
5|$|Days {{after the}} arrival of the RUF, on 2 June, rebels and {{soldiers}} attacked the Mammy Yoko hotel—where around 800 foreign citizens had gathered under the protection of Nigerian soldiers—in response to a Nigerian naval bombardment of Freetown. Penfold was able to see the firefight from the high commission building, and telephoned the Sierra Leonean defence headquarters to demand an end to the violence, threatening to request the deployment of US Marines from the USS Kearsarge, which was anchored offshore. The defence headquarters promptly ordered an end <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting,</b> and the occupants of the hotel were evacuated to another nearby hotel for the night and then to the USS Kearsarge the next morning (3 June). In addition, Penfold and the remaining members of his staff (most of the staff and all their families had already left) were ordered to evacuate on the Kearsarge, despite Penfold's objections. The Kearsarge sailed to Conakry, where Kabbah had been staying {{since the beginning of the}} coup. No country recognised the military junta, and the international community continued to recognise the exiled Kabbah government as the legitimate government of Sierra Leone. Kabbah re-established his government in Conakry, basing it in a former Chinese restaurant leased by the British government through Penfold. There, Penfold advised Kabbah on keeping up the government's presence on the international stage, such as by ensuring that a representative was sent to international meetings. He also continued to run the British diplomatic mission in Freetown; the high commission continued to pay its local staff and began smuggling food and money into Sierra Leone. During the ten months in which the Kabbah government was exiled, Penfold—with funds from the British Department for International Development (DfID)—also assisted in the setting up of a covert radio station, which broadcast on behalf of the exiled government.|$|E

40|$|In this report, we {{consider}} the accumulation in roots, and transport <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot,</b> of Na+ and K+ in intact lettuce plants (Lactuca sativa cv Black-seeded Simpson). Plants were grown in modified Hoagland medium supplemented with 10 moles NaCl per cubic meter. At this salinity, significant levels of Na+ were accumulated in roots and shoots, {{but there was no}} reduction in plant growth. Transport characteristics for both Na+ and K+ were qualitatively similar to those previously reported, for Spergularia marina, indicating that the results obtained with these experimental protocols are not limited to one unconventional experimental plant. The most pronounced difference in transport of the two ions was evident when transport was followed in a chase period after a 10 minute uptake pulse. For Na+, there was an initially rapid, but small, loss of label <b>to</b> <b>the</b> medium, and very little movement <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot.</b> For K+, little label was lost from the plants, but translocation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> proceeded for at least 60 minutes.

For K+, both uptake and translocation were reduced by about 50 %.
