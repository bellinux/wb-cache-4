40|$|Summary Conifers have {{defenses}} such as {{the production}} of phenolic compounds and resins that can be induced by bark beetles and other invading organisms, but the signaling agents involved are unknown. The anatomical effects of methyl jas-monate (MJ), a potent inducer of certain plant defenses, were compared with wounding of the bark of 12 – 15 -year-old trees of five conifer species. Wounding in all species resulted in tis-sue necrosis and wound periderm development immediately around the wound site. One cm from the wound, swelling of phloem polyphenolic parenchyma cells and phenolic accumu-lation were observed in Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco, Picea pungens Engelman, Larix occidentalis Nutt. and Pinus monticola Douglas ex D. Don, but not in Taxus brevifolia Nutt. <b>Traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts</b> were formed in response to wounding in three species of Pinaceae, but not in P. monticola, which formed irregular clusters of cells rather than ducts. Taxus brev-ifolia did not form resin ducts in response to either wounding or MJ treatment. In the Pinaceae species studied, surface applica-tion of 100 mM MJ caused similar anatomical changes to those observed in response to wounding, including phenolic accu-mulation, cell swelling and <b>traumatic</b> resin <b>duct</b> formation, {{but it did not}} induce a wound periderm. <b>Traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts</b> dif-fered in size among the study species, ranging from small in L. occidentalis to very large in P. menziesii. In P. menziesii, P. pungens and L. occidentalis, <b>traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts</b> were more abundant after MJ treatment than after wounding. We conclude that the octadecanoid pathway is likely involved in defense responses in stems of the Pinaceae, but not necessarily in other taxa...|$|R
40|$|Rockfall {{and snow}} {{avalanche}} events often cause injury to European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) trees, {{giving rise to}} the formation of callus tissue and tangential rows of <b>traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts</b> (TRDs). We analyzed and quantified anatomical reactions of juvenile trees injured {{before the start of the}} growing season by snow avalanches (15 trees, 324 cross sections) or rockfalls (18 trees, 270 cross sections). <b>Traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts</b> were observed in the growth ring formed following injury in 94. 3 % of the rockfall samples and 87. 3 % of the snow avalanche samples. <b>Traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts</b> were formed at the beginning of the new annual ring around wounds caused by rockfalls. In contrast, in trees injured by snow avalanches, TRDs were not formed until after the formation of several rows of early earlywood (EE) tracheids (mean ± SD = 4. 19 ± 2. 56 rows). The dimensions of the EE tracheids observed in the snow avalanche samples were greatly reduced in the tissues bordering the wound, with radial width reaching an average of only 50 % and lumen cross-sectional area an average of only 46 % of pre-event values. It is therefore possible to differentiate injuries due to past snow avalanches from injuries due to rockfall based on anatomical growth reactions in the tissues bordering scars...|$|R
30|$|It {{is noted}} that, {{including}} the type species Brachyoxylon notabile Hollick et Jeffrey, many Brachyoxylon species (e.g., B. trautii (Barale) Philippe, B. liebermanii Philippe, B. avramii Iamandei et Iamandei, B. dobrogiacum Iamandei et Iamandei, B. semibiseriatum (Pant et Singh) Kurzawe et Merlotti, and B. serrae Philippe et al.) {{are characterized by}} having tangential tracheid pitting and/or <b>traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts</b> (Table 1). Nevertheless, neither tangential tracheid pitting nor <b>traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts</b> are observed in Brachyoxylon zhejiangense sp. nov. Being different from the new species from China, Brachyoxylon currumilii from the Lower–Middle Jurassic of Argentina bears scanty and diffuse axial parenchyma (Bodnar et al. 2013). Another Argentina species, Brachyoxylon baqueroensis differs from the new species by having distinct annual rings, triseriate radial pits, and a higher number of cross-field pits (Vera and Césari 2015). Generally, Brachyoxylon zhejiangense sp. nov. {{seems to be more}} comparable to B. woodworthianum Torrey (mid-Cretaceous, North America) in ray height, obscure annual rings, and the absence of tangential tracheid pitting and parenchyma; however, original description of B. woodworthianum shows that it has traumatic resin canals and abietan pitting in traumatic ray cells (Torrey 1923).|$|R
40|$|Past {{activity}} of geomorphic processes can be reconstructed on tree-ring series using {{the presence of}} injuries, reaction wood or abrupt changes in the annual increment. The analysis of these features provides valuable data on years with process activity. In contrast, an intra-annual dating has so far normally only been possible through the analysis of injuries. In this technical note, it is shown that, in tree-ring studies realized with conifers, resin ducts may {{have the potential for}} providing information on the intra-seasonal timing of past geomorphic processes as well. However, because ducts may occur as a result of influences other than geomorphic, detailed field investigations and the identification of processes present at the study site imperatively need to precede dendrogeomorphological investigations. Data obtained from 1298 cross-sections indicate that the presence of resin ducts in Picea abies (L.) Karst. and Larix decidua Mill. can be considered {{to be the result of}} geomorphic activity if they form tangentially oriented rows with a compact and continuous arrangement of <b>traumatic</b> <b>ducts.</b> The presence of resin ducts may also help to improve the quality of reconstructions in studies using Abies alba Mill. as vertical resin ducts occur exclusively at or next to injuries. In contrast, resin ducts apparently cannot be used for dendrogeomorphological analyses of Pinus ssp...|$|R
30|$|In C. libani, onset and {{dynamics}} of cambial activity and xylogenesis are triggered by daily means of stem and air temperatures whereas water availability {{has a higher}} influence on growth rates and cessation of wood formation. Within sites, duration of xylogenesis does not significantly differ with respect to age and tree size. C. libani grows well outside its natural range and thus may be a promising species for forestation in Central Europe with respect to climate change. We suggest further studies on if/how <b>traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts</b> influence tree ring width.|$|R
40|$|The conifer Picea abies (Norway spruce) defends {{itself against}} herbivores and {{pathogens}} with a terpenoid-based oleoresin composed chiefly of monoterpenes (C 10) and diterpenes (C 20). An important group of enzymes in oleoresin biosynthesis are the short-chain isoprenyl diphosphate synthases that produce geranyl diphosphate (C 10), farnesyl diphosphate (C 15), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (C 20) as precursors of different terpenoid classes. We isolated a gene from P. abies via a homology-based {{polymerase chain reaction}} approach that encodes a short-chain isoprenyl diphosphate synthase making an unusual mixture of two products, geranyl diphosphate (C 10) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (C 20). This bifunctionality was confirmed by expression in both prokaryotic (Escherichia coli) and eukaryotic (P. abies embryogenic tissue) hosts. Thus, this isoprenyl diphosphate synthase, designated PaIDS 1, could contribute to the biosynthesis of both major terpene types in P. abies oleoresin. In saplings, PaIDS 1 transcript was restricted to wood and bark, and transcript level increased dramatically after methyl jasmonate treatment, which induces the formation of new (<b>traumatic)</b> resin <b>ducts.</b> Polyclonal antibodies localized the PaIDS 1 protein to the epithelial cells surrounding the <b>traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts.</b> PaIDS 1 has a close phylogenetic relationship to single-product conifer geranyl diphosphate and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases. Its catalytic properties and reaction mechanism resemble those of conifer geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases, except that significant quantities of the intermediate geranyl diphosphate are released. Using site-directed mutagenesis and chimeras of PaIDS 1 with single-product geranyl diphosphate and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases, specific amino acid residues were identified that alter the relative composition of geranyl to geranylgeranyl diphosphate...|$|R
30|$|Our general {{sampling}} methods follow Margolis et al. (2007), in which large quaking aspen patches embedded in mesic mixed conifer and spruce-fir {{forests of the}} upper Rio Grande Basin were mapped and tree-ring dated with multiple lines of evidence to reconstruct stand-replacing fire patch sizes and dates. The four lines of evidence included 1) quaking aspen age structure, 2) conifer death dates, 3) conifer <b>traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts</b> or ring-width changes, and 4) conifer fire scars. All conifer death dates were bark-ring dates. Bark-ring dates indicate that either bark or other evidence of an intact outer ring (e.g., insect galleries) was present on the samples—this ensures that the outer ring dates are actual tree death dates.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Inflammatory {{conditions}} of the biliary tree are infrequently reported {{with the exception of}} sclerosing cholangitis. These conditions, especially when affecting the common bile duct (CBD), can be mistaken for tumours; their existence should be considered in the differential diagnosis of biliary lesions and, in particular, biliary strictures. Few descriptions of inflammatory conditions exist in the published literature. METHODS: A comprehensive search was undertaken of the last 20 years of published literature. RESULTS: Potential aetiological factors include infection, infestation, <b>traumatic</b> bile <b>duct</b> injury, foreign body or gallstone reaction and the host inflammatory response. CONCLUSIONS: These conditions typically mimic malignant tumours of the CBD but knowledge of the aforementioned processes might alter the surgical approach to biliary strictures (especially after previous cholecystectomy), with greater emphasis on surgical exploration...|$|R
40|$|Methyl jasmonate, a {{well-known}} inducer of plant defense responses, {{was used to}} manipulate the biochemistry and anatomy of mature Picea abies (Norway spruce) stems. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate if this treatment protected trees against attack by the blue-stain fungus Ceratocystis polonica [(Siem.) C. Moreau], the spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) and the white pine weevil (Pissodes strobi Peck.). Application of methyl jasmonate lead to several biochemical and anatomical changes and the results suggest that induced defenses such as formation of <b>traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts,</b> enhancement of resin flow, and increased accumulation of volatile terpenes and diterpene resin acids, all triggered by application of jasmonates, play a significant role in Norway spruce defense against multiple enemies. The results also confirmed that the jasmonate pathway directly regulates the formation of these induced defenses...|$|R
30|$|A mapped aspen patch was {{determined}} to represent the minimum extent of a previous stand-replacing burn patch if: 1) the oldest aspen estimated pith dates were associated with (≤ 5 years following) a fire event recorded by conifer death dates from within the patch or fire scars on surviving trees along {{the periphery of the}} patch, and 2) estimated aspen pith dates were part of a site-level (i.e., multi-patch) aspen recruitment pulse. The rarity and poor spatial coverage of fire-scarred trees at some sites (e.g., n = 6) prevented the use of percent-scarred filters to categorize and compare relatively widespread versus local fires between sites (Swetnam and Baisan 2003). Instead, we categorized fires recorded by ≥ 5 conifer samples at a site (e.g., conifer death dates, growth changes or <b>traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts,</b> and fire scars) as likely being more widespread than fires recorded by fewer trees.|$|R
40|$|Context A {{pancreatic}} fistula is {{the most}} common complication of pancreatic injury. Although spontaneous closure of pancreatic ductal disruption has been reported, surgical treatment is accepted as the single most carried-out intervention in major ductal injury. We report a case of pancreatic duct disruption due to a bullet injury managed successfully by endoscopic pancreatic duct stenting. Case report A 28 -year old male sustained a bullet injury leading to proximal pancreatic duct disruption with leakage of dye. After a month of unsuccessful conservative management, graded endoscopic pancreatic duct stenting was carried out, leading to closure of the leak. The patient has gained 15 kilograms of weight at one year of follow-up without any complications. Conclusion This is probably the first case of successful endoscopic management of pancreatic duct disruption due to a bullet injury. In carefully selected patients, successful non-surgical management of <b>traumatic</b> pancreatic <b>duct</b> disruption is feasible...|$|R
30|$|We {{prepared}} and analyzed fire-scarred specimens using dendrochronology techniques (Stokes and Smiley 1968, Arno and Sneck 1977, Orvis and Grissino-Mayer 2002). Samples were air dried and sanded with progressively finer sandpaper until the cellular structure within each annual growth ring, {{and the position}} of fire scars within the ring series, could be viewed clearly under a stereomicroscope with 7 - 45 X magnification (Speer 2010). We identified 373 fire scars in 70 whole or partial cross-sections. Fire scars were identified {{by the presence of}} a gap (often charred) within the ring and subsequent overlapping curvilinear growth characteristic of the tree’s healing pattern (McBride 1983). In addition, we used other fire-associated ring characteristics including <b>traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts,</b> double latewood, and growth releases to confirm the presence of a scar found elsewhere along the circumference of the cross-section (Brown and Swetnam 1994). We approximated the seasonality of fire occurrence by assessing the position of the scar within the annual growth ring (Caprio and Swetnam 1995).|$|R

The dormant cambium consisted of about 5 cells at the Turkish sites and 7 cells at Bayreuth. Cambial activity set in, when daily minimum temperatures exceeded 0 °C and daily means of air and stem temperature exceeded 5 °C. Xylogenesis started between April and May, ended approximately the end of September {{to the beginning of}} October and lasted 134 (at tree line) to 174 days (at the lowest Turkish site). Mean ring widths varied from 0.55 to 3.35 mm, with highest values observed at Bayreuth very likely resulting from a steady water supply during growing season. Means of daily cell production rates varied from 0.73 to 0.12. Samples containing <b>traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts</b> occurred only rarely and where not used for analysis.|$|R
30|$|The {{mean age}} of {{patients}} was 41 years (range, 4 – 61 years). The male/female ratio was 1 : 2.8 (13 : 37). The most common diagnosis (70 %, 35 / 50) was PANDO. Other diagnoses include acute dacryocystitis (12 %, 6 / 50), failed external DCR (8 %, 4 / 50), <b>traumatic</b> nasolacrimal <b>duct</b> obstruction (6 %, 3 / 50), and persistent congenital nasolacrimal duct obstructions (4 %, 2 / 50). External DCR was performed in 65 % (34 / 52) and endoscopic DCR in 35 % (18 / 52) of the cases. All the blood cultures were uniformly negative {{both in terms of}} abnormal physical changes in media (Figure 1 c) as well subcultures (Figure 1 d); 22 % (11 / 50) did not receive post-operative antibiotic prophylaxis. None of the patients developed any signs of wound infections.

40|$|Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) {{produces}} an oleoresin {{characterized by a}} diverse array of terpenoids, monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, and diterpene resin acids that can protect conifers against potential herbivores and pathogens. Oleoresin accumulates constitutively in resin ducts in the cortex and phloem (bark) of Norway spruce stems. De novo formation of <b>traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts</b> (TDs) is observed in the developing secondary xylem (wood) after insect attack, fungal elicitation, and mechanical wounding. Here, we characterize the methyl jasmonate-induced formation of TDs in Norway spruce by microscopy, chemical analyses of resin composition, and assays of terpenoid biosynthetic enzymes. The response involves tissue-specific differentiation of TDs, terpenoid accumulation, and induction of enzyme activities of both prenyltransferases and terpene synthases in the developing xylem, a tissue that constitutively lacks axial resin ducts in spruce. The induction of a complex defense response in Norway spruce by methyl jasmonate application provides new avenues to evaluate the role of resin defenses for protection of conifers against destructive pests such as white pine weevils (Pissodes strobi), bark beetles (Coleoptera, Scolytidae), and insect-associated tree pathogens...|$|R
40|$|Laser microdissection of conifer stem tissues: Isolation and {{analysis}} of high quality RNA, terpene synthase enzyme activity and terpenoid metabolites from resin ducts and cambial zone tissue of white spruce (Picea glauca) Eric Abbott 1, 2, Dawn Hall 1, Björn Hamberger 1, Jörg Bohlmann 1, 2 * Background: Laser microdissection (LMD) has been established for isolation of individual tissue types from herbaceous plants. However, there are few reports of cell- and tissue-specific analysis in woody perennials. While microdissected tissues are commonly analyzed for gene expression, reports of protein, enzyme activity and metabolite analysis are limited {{due in part to}} an inability to amplify these molecules. Conifer stem tissues are organized in regular patterns with xylem, phloem and cortex development controlled by the activity of the cambial zone (CZ). Defense responses of conifer stems against insects and pathogens involve increased accumulation of terpenoids in cortical resin ducts (CRDs) and de novo formation of <b>traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts</b> from CZ initials.

30|$|The xylem in {{stems of}} C. libani showed {{differences}} in onset, duration {{and end of}} cambial activity and xylogenesis as well as growth rates with respect to climate and site conditions. Temperature, especially daily means of air and stem temperature, {{appeared to be the}} main trigger {{when it comes to the}} onset of cambial activity and xylogenesis, whereas water availability and other factors, e.g. stand structure, light exposure etc., affect the total annual increment. Under the same site conditions (or within the respective sites) trees showed no significant differences in timing and duration of cambial activity and xylogenesis regardless of plant age and size. Cessation of growth is affected either by temperature or- as typical for the natural range habitats- by restricted water availability. Obviously, a temperate climate with an evenly distributed rainfall during the growing season is more favorable for C. libani than a Mediterranean climate. Our results therefore underline the potential of C. libani for afforestation outside its natural range with respect to climate change. Further studies on the relationship between <b>traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts</b> and tree ring width are necessary for a better understanding of the wood formation processes.|$|R
30|$|Anatomical {{indicators}} supplement scars for dating historical fires, {{often in}} conjunction with changes in ring width (Swetnam et al. 1991, Holz and Veblen 2009, Swetnam et al. 2009, Margolis et al. 2011). Redwood, giant sequoia, {{and other members of}} the Cupressaceae respond to injury by producing inducible <b>traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts</b> (TRD) in the xylem (Hudgins et al. 2004, Krokene et al. 2008), and fire-associated TRD occur up to 6 m above the ground on redwood trunks (Brown and Swetnam 1994). TRD provide evidence of fire in redwoods (Jones and Russell 2015), but the mechanics and variation of fire-induced TRD are poorly understood. Other anatomical reactions to heat exposure in conifers include resin soaking, discolored wood, and callus tissue formation (Smith et al. 2016). Intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs) such as false rings and double latewood correspond with fire in both redwood and giant sequoia (Brown and Swetnam 1994, Swetnam et al. 2009, Jones and Russell 2015). IADFs result from disruption of normal xylogenesis during the growing season and reflect variations in environmental conditions often caused by climate (Vieira et al. 2010, De Micco et al. 2016).|$|R

30|$|Age-structure-based {{methods for}} reconstructing fire history were {{developed}} in coniferous subalpine and boreal forests of North America where stand-replacing fire regimes are dominant (Clements 1910, Heinselman 1973, Agee 1993, Johnson and Gutsell 1994). By definition, stand-replacing fires leave few or no surviving trees to record direct evidence of those fires within the highest burn severity patches (but note that fire-scarred survivors can sometimes {{be found on the}} edges of such patches; e.g., Margolis et al. 2007). Post-fire tree cohorts, assumed to have established soon after the fire, are {{the most common type of}} evidence used to date and map stand-replacing burns. In the Rocky Mountains, the assumption that there is typically rapid recruitment of a post-fire cohort (i.e., < 5 yr) within stand-replacing burn patches is well supported in the case of quaking aspen, because it has evolved mechanisms for rapid regeneration, and has been commonly observed to do so following fires (Clements 1910, Patton and Avant 1970). Post-fire cohort evidence (dates and mapped perimeters) can be combined with the relatively rare direct conifer evidence of fire (e.g., fire scars, tree death dates, ring-width changes or <b>traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts)</b> to reconstruct annually resolved stand-replacing fire dates (Johnson and Gutsell 1994, Margolis et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|Following {{mechanical}} injury, {{stems of}} many conifers produce tangential rows of <b>traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts</b> (TRDs), {{the distribution of}} which has been used to date geomorphic events. However, little is known about how far TRD formation extends tangentially and axially from the point of injury or what the time course of TRD appearance is. We analyzed 28 injuries in eight Larix decidua Mill. tree stems resulting from debris flows in October 2000 and November 2004. Injuries occurred outside the period of cambial activity, and TRD formation occurred in the first layers of the growth ring formed in the year following that of injury. The axial extent of TRD formation averaged 74 cm and was greater above the injury than below it. At the height of the wound center, TRDs extended horizontally to a mean of 18 % of the stem circumference excluding that portion where the cambium had been destroyed. In subsequent growth rings, TRDs, if present, were confined mainly to the height of the center of injury. Both the vertical and horizontal extent of TRD formation was related to the injury size. Within growth rings, the position of TRD formation changed with increasing distance from the wound progressing from early earlywood to later portions of the growth ring...|$|R
40|$|The {{eruption}} of Parícutin (1943 – 1952), a cinder cone volcano in Michoacán, Mexico, caused dendrochronological and dendrochemical responses {{that might be}} useful as general dating tools for eruptions. For the eruption period, pines near Parícutin have slightly suppressed ring widths plus high inter-annual variability of width. Wood anatomy changes include <b>traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts</b> and thin bands of false latewood. Dendrochemistry of tree rings shows little temporal variation in most elements, but beginning in 1943 sulfur content increased in rings of four trees and phosphorus content increased in rings of two trees. Hypotheses for increased S and P include new availability of pre-existing soil S and P and/or new input of S and P from the tephra itself. Pines at Parícutin also show suppressed ring widths for five years beginning in 1970, and had the eruption date not been known, the most likely conclusion from ring-width data alone {{would have been an}} eruption from 1970 to 1974. However, the 1970 s suppression was in response to defoliation by a pine sawfly outbreak, not an eruption. For dendrochronological dating of cinder-cone eruptions, a combination of multiple characteristics (width, chemistry, and anatomy) would be more reliable than depending on any one characteristic alone...|$|R
40|$|The leprosis disease shows a viral {{etiology}} and the citrus leprosis virus is considered its etiologic agent. The disease may show {{two types of}} cytopatologic symptom caused by two virus: nuclear (CiLV-N) and cytoplasmic (CiLV-C) types. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the morpho-anatomical differences in the lesions caused by leprosis virus-cytoplasmic and nuclear types in Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck ?Pêra?. Leaf and fruit lesions were collected in Piracicaba/São Paulo (cytoplasmic type) and Monte Alegre do Sul/São Paulo and Amparo/São Paulo (nuclear type). The lesions were photographed and then fixed in Karnovsky solution, dehydrated in a graded ethylic series, embedded in hydroxy-ethyl methacrylate resin (Leica Historesin), sectioned (5 ?m thick), stained and mounted in synthetic resin. The digital images were acquired in a microscope with digital video camera. Leaf and fruit lesions caused by the two viruses were morphologically distinct. Only the lesion caused by CiLV-N virus presented three well-defined regions. In both lesions there was the accumulation of lipidic substances in necrotic areas that were surrounded by cells with amorphous or droplets protein. Only leaf and fruit lesions caused by CiLV-N virus exhibited <b>traumatic</b> gum <b>ducts</b> in the vascular bundles. 2010 Disponivel em:. Acesso em: 18 out. 2010...|$|R
40|$|Summary Norway spruce trees (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) pretreated by {{wounding}} and {{fungal infection}} showed highly enhanced resistance to a subsequent challenge inoculation with the pathogenic bluestain fungus Ceratocystis polonica (Siem.) C. Moreau. This {{is the first}} time the effectiveness of the constitutive and inducible defenses has been shown to depend on prior wounding and infection in conifers, although such acquired resistance has previously been found in several angio-sperms. Trees that were pretreated with a combination of 12 bark wounds (1. 6 × 10 cm), four fungal inoculations and four sterile inoculations 1 [...] 15 days before mass inoculation with C. polonica at 400 inoculations per square meter over a 0. 8 m stem section had significantly shorter necroses in the phloem, less bluestained sapwood, and less dead cambium than un-treated control trees. Pretreatment with four fungal or sterile inoculations alone did not lead to enhanced resistance. Pretreat-ment by bark wounding alone seemed to provide an interme-diate degree of resistance compared to bark wounding, fungal inoculations and sterile inoculations combined. All trees had a marked {{increase in the number of}} resin ducts in the year of inoculation compared with previous years, suggesting that formation of <b>traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts</b> play an important role in the development and maintainance of enhanced resistance...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{reconstruct}} spatio-temporal patterns of avalanche events in a forested avalanche path of the Queyras massif (Echalp avalanche path, Southeast French Alps). Analysis of past evnts was based on tree-ring series from 163 heavily affected multi-centennial larch trees (Larix decidua Mill.) near or next to the avalanche path. A total of 514 growth disturbances, such as tangential rows of <b>traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts,</b> the onset of compression wood as well as abrupt growth suppression or release, are identified in the samples indicating 38 destructive snow avalanches between 1338 and 2010. The mean return period of snow avalanches was 22 years with a 4 % probability that avalanche occurs in a particular year. On a temporal plan, three maxima In snow avalanche frequency were reconstructed at the beginning of the 16 th and 19 th centuries and around 1850, correlating with above average winter temperatures and glacier advances. Analysis of the spatial distribution of disturbed trees contributed to the determination of four preferential patterns of avalanche events. The comparison of dendrogeomorphic data with historical records demonstrate that at least 18 events- six of were undocumented- reached the hamlet of Echalp during the last seven centuries, but no significant temporal trend was detected concerning the frequency of these extreme events...|$|R
40|$|Conifers possess {{inducible}} terpenoid defense systems. These {{systems are}} associated with the formation of <b>traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts</b> (TRD) and are underpinned by enhanced gene expression and activity of terpene synthases (TPS), enzymes responsible for oleoresin formation. We first determined that Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis [Bong. ] Carriere) had the capacity for TRD formation by mechanically wounding representative trees. We then proceeded to investigate whether the white pine weevil (Pissodes strobi Peck.), a stem-boring insect, can influence the expression of genes encoding monoterpene synthases (mono-tps) in Sitka spruce. We went on to compare this response with the effects of a simulated insect attack by drill wounding. A significant increase in mono-tps transcript level was observed in the leaders of lateral branches of weevil-attacked and mechanically wounded trees. In this study, weevils induced a more rapid enhancement of mono-tps gene expression. A full-length Sitka spruce mono-tps cDNA (PsTPS 2) was isolated, expressed in Escherichia coli, and functionally identified as (—) -pinene synthase. The recombinant (—) -pinene synthase catalyzes the formation of (—) -α-pinene and (—) -β-pinene, both of which are known constituents of stem oleoresin in Sitka spruce and increase in abundance after weevil attack. These data suggest that increased (—) -pinene synthase gene expression is an important element of the direct defense system deployed in Sitka spruce after insect attack...|$|R
40|$|Summary We {{investigated}} the cellular responses of stem tis-sues of mature Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees to inocula-tions with two fungal pathogens. The bark beetle vectored fungus, Leptographium wingfieldii Morelet, induced longer le-sions in the bark, stronger swelling of polyphenolic paren-chyma cells, more polyphenol accumulation and increased ray parenchyma activity {{compared with the}} root rot fungus, Het-erobasidion annosum (Fr.) Bref., or mechanical wounding. Axial resin ducts in the xylem are a general feature of the pre-formed defenses of Scots pine, {{but there was no}} clear induction of additional <b>traumatic</b> axial resin <b>ducts</b> in response to wound-ing or fungal infection. The anatomical responses of Scots pine to pathogen infection were localized to the infection site and were attenuated away from bark lesions. The responses ob-served in Scots pine were compared with published studies on Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) for which anatomi-cally based defense responses have been well characterized...|$|R
30|$|The recent {{occurrence}} of large fires with a substantial stand-replacing {{component in the}} southwestern United States (e.g., Cerro Grande, 2000; Rodeo-Chedeski, 2002; Aspen, 2003; Horseshoe 2, Las Conchas, and Wallow, 2011) has {{raised questions about the}} historical role of stand-replacing fire in the region. We reconstructed fire dates and stand-replacing fire patch sizes using four lines of tree-ring evidence at four upper montane forest sites (> 2600 m) in the Madrean Sky Islands and Mogollon Plateau of Arizona and New Mexico, USA. The four lines of tree-ring evidence include: (1) quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and spruce-fir age structure, (2) conifer death dates, (3) <b>traumatic</b> resin <b>ducts</b> and ring-width changes, and (4) conifer fire scars. Pre- 1905 fire regimes in the upper montane forest sites were variable, with drier, south-facing portions of some sites recording frequent, low-severity fire (mean fire interval of all fires ranging from 5 yr to 11 yr among sites), others burning with stand-replacing severity, and others with no evidence of fire for > 300 yr. Reconstructed fires at three of the four sites (Pinaleño Mountains, San Francisco Peaks, and Gila Wilderness) had stand-replacing fire patches > 200 ha, with maximum patch sizes ranging from 286 ha in mixed conifer-aspen forests to 521 ha in spruce-fir forests. These data suggest that recent stand-replacing fire patches as large as 200 ha to 500 ha burning in upper elevation (> 2600 m) mixed conifer-aspen and spruce-fir forests may be within the historical range of variability.|$|R
