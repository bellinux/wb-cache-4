5|$|Cats have {{excellent}} hearing and can detect an extremely {{broad range of}} frequencies. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> higher-pitched sounds than either dogs or humans, detecting frequencies from 55Hz to 79,000Hz, a range of 10.5octaves, while humans and dogs both have ranges of about 9octaves. Cats can hear ultrasound, which is important in hunting because many species of rodents make ultrasonic calls. However, they do not communicate using ultrasound like rodents do. Cats' hearing is also sensitive and among the best of any mammal, being most acute {{in the range of}} 500Hz to 32kHz. This sensitivity is further enhanced by the cat's large movable outer ears (their pinnae), which both amplify sounds and help detect the direction of a noise.|$|E
5|$|Decatur House (748 Jackson Place NW) is {{allegedly}} {{haunted by}} the ghost of Stephen Decatur. In 1820, Commodore James Barron challenged Commodore Decatur to a duel over comments Decatur had made regarding Barron's conduct in the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair of 1807. The two men duelled on March 20, and Decatur was mortally wounded in the stomach. Decatur was rushed back to his home, and died there on March 22. A year after Decatur's death, his ghost reportedly began appearing at the house—standing in a second floor window looking out at H Street NW or leaving {{the back door of}} the house with a box of dueling pistols. So many witnesses saw the specter of Decatur that the window was walled up. Some people have also claimed that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> his widow, who became hysterical at his death, weeping in the house.|$|E

5|$|General Edward Braddock left Observatory Hill in Georgetown in 1755 on an {{expedition}} to capture the French Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War. Braddock's expedition was surprised on July 9 {{in the vicinity of}} present-day Braddock, Pennsylvania, in what is now known as the Battle of the Monongahela. Nearly 900 of Braddock's 1,300 men were killed or wounded, and Braddock himself killed. Since before the American Civil War, witnesses say that on the anniversary of Braddock's departure <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> shouted military orders, horses' hooves on cobblestones, the sound of men marching, and the sound of metal clanking against metal. The sounds can be heard near the old Long Bridge or near the Georgetown bluffs overlooking the Potomac River.|$|E
5|$|Michael (Steve Carell), Pam (Jenna Fischer), and Ryan (B. J. Novak) are {{struggling}} {{to adjust to the}} work environment of the new Michael Scott Paper Company. The office space used to be a closet; water pipes run through the room, so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> the toilets flush from the Dunder Mifflin bathrooms above them. Ryan openly goofs off in front of Pam and Michael and insults both of them in their presence during phone conversations. Pam and Ryan bicker over who is responsible for making copies until Michael separates them into corners. Pam, who joined the company as a saleswoman, is given the corner where the photocopier sits. She is concerned that Michael will force her to be the receptionist, which is why she quit Dunder Mifflin in the first place. She goes upstairs and asks Charles Miner (Idris Elba) for her job back, but Charles has already given the job to a new employee, Kelly Hannon (Ellie Kemper), who ends up going by her middle name—Erin—to avoid confusion with Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling).|$|E

50|$|Captioned {{telephony}} is the streaming of real-time text captions {{in parallel}} with speech on a phone call. This is used {{by people who are}} hard of hearing to allow them to have the full benefit of listening as best <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> <b>hearing</b> all the intonation etc. in speech, yet have the captions for those words they cannot hear clearly enough. In the United States, captioned telephony is one of the free relay services that is available to anyone who is hard-of-hearing. Originally developed for use on the analog phone systems (where it requires a special phone) it is now available over IP using standard devices.|$|R
50|$|El Naddaha {{takes the}} form of stunningly {{beautiful}} woman who appears, as if by chance, to men walking by the Nile at night. The men are usually a pair. The creature calls one by his first name, rendering him speechless, hypnotized, and obedient to her voice which he blindly follows, while the other man is unaffected, and attempts to pull the other back. The creature calls in a soft, sleepy, hypnotizing voice until the second unaffected man succeeds at last in reviving the called man from his trance. The two run away as fast as <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> <b>hearing</b> her voice still echoing as they run.|$|R

25|$|Due to age and rust, the Carillon {{ceased to}} play in 1981. In 1988, the last symphonies of U.P. Naming Mahal and Push On U.P.! (U.P. Diliman's {{athletic}} cheer) from the tower was played during the December's Lantern Parade. Since then, the Carillon was never tuned. But as late as 2001, students say that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> the rhymes of London Bridge Is Falling Down and Sing a Song of Six Pence despite being closed to prevent further mishap.|$|E
25|$|The {{conclave}} {{also provided}} for the cardinals a space in which <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> mass, and {{in which they can}} eat, sleep, and pass time attended by servants. From 1455, conclaves have been held in the Vatican; until the Great Schism, they were held in the Dominican convent of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. Since 1996, John Paul II's Apostolic Constitution Universi Dominici gregis requires the cardinals to be lodged in the Domus Sanctae Marthae during a papal conclave, but to continue to vote in the Sistine Chapel.|$|E
25|$|The {{superior}} courts {{from the}} provinces and territories are courts of inherent jurisdiction, {{which means that}} the jurisdiction of the superior courts is more than just what is conferred by statute. Following the principles of English common law, because the superior courts derive their authority from the Constitution, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> any matter unless there is a federal or provincial statute that says otherwise or that gives exclusive jurisdiction to some other court or tribunal. The doctrine of inherent jurisdiction gives superior courts greater freedom than statutory courts to be flexible and creative in the delivering of legal remedies and relief.|$|E

Guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) recommends that Mercedes and Sam stop speaking {{to each other for}} a week so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> what their hearts are telling them. Mercedes sings [...] "Don't Wanna Lose You" [...] and Sam reciprocates by singing a mash-up of [...] "Bamboléo" [...] and [...] "Hero".|$|E
500|$|The UN {{identifies}} Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish as its six official languages. [...] Delegates {{speaking in}} any of these languages will have their words simultaneously translated into all of the others, and attendees are provided with headphones through which <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> the translations. A delegate is allowed to make a statement in a non-official language, but must provide either an interpreter or a written copy of his/her remarks translated into an official language. English and French are the working languages of the United Nations Secretariat, as most of the daily communication within the Secretariat and most of the signs in the UN headquarters building are in those languages.|$|E
500|$|The Protoss are humanoids, [...] {{with two}} {{luminous}} eyes, typically gold, green, or blue. With two fingers {{flanked by two}} opposable thumbs on each hand, two large toes on each foot (four small toes in earlier games), digitigrade legs, broad chests and shoulders with narrow waists, Protoss are very agile and physically strong. A bony crest extends back from the crown of the head, with long neural strands sprouting {{from the back of}} the head. These strands facilitate the basic psychic communal link all Protoss naturally share. Each Protoss has a different skin shade that corresponds to the tribe from which they are descended. The Protoss do not possess any visible ears (but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear,</b> as when Terrans speak to them or hear what they are thinking), mouths or noses, but are able to communicate telepathically and possess strong olfactory sensitivities. Protoss do not need to eat or drink, but are shown in The Dark Templar Saga to instead absorb energy from a form of photosynthesis. The average life expectancy for a Protoss is about one thousand years. Little is known of the internal anatomy of the Protoss.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, Hasta la Raíz {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. Beverly Bryan of The Village Voice {{stated that the}} album [...] "casts a spell with deep feeling, and melodies and lyrics that linger in the mind. Elegantly adorned with subtle strings and velvety production, it {{has the kind of}} warmth people are always saying <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> on old vinyl records". Bryan also predicted that this release would be recognized in the future as the singer's [...] "most profound and enduring statement". In another positive review, Natalia Cano of the magazine Rolling Stone Mexico, referred to the album as [...] "fresh and honest pop, a reflection of her musical maturity", reiterating that the album [...] "continues to place her {{as one of the most}} important composer and performer of Latin America." [...] AllMusic's Mariano Prunes gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars ranking, and on his review stated that [...] "these are extremely well-written songs in the spirit of the great Latin America romantic tradition of which Lara was a founding father, but infused with a contemporary perspective". Luis Romero of the website Coffee and Saturday said that the album is one of the best pop releases of the year, praising Lafourcade's evolution as a musician, but was critical of Lafourcade for not having extended [...] "her comfort zone", since it is too early in her career to become settled in one type of music, [...] "and the proof is that the best album tracks are those where she is helped by Leonel García, Torreblanca and María Daniela". An editor from Televisa Espectáculos wrote a mixed review, commenting that the album has to be listened to twice to [...] "fall in love with at least one song", comparing positively the title track with Lafourcade's work on her previous album (Mujer Divina) and the songs [...] "Mi Lugar Favorito" [...] and [...] "Te Quiero Ver" [...] with her album Hu Hu Hu, creating a [...] "mix of sounds" [...] on which Lafourcade shows all the things she learned after working with Agustín Lara's catalog. Lissette Corsa, of MTVIggy, stated that [...] "despite moments of darkness and heartfelt sadness, Hasta la Raiz bristles with a sense of adventure and optimism", and noted the influence of Chilean songwriter Violeta Parra in the track [...] "Vámonos Negrito", as part of Lafourcade's [...] "eclectic artistry". Corsa also noted that the singer [...] "drew from Joni Mitchell, Charles Bradley, and Amy Winehouse".|$|E

At that time, two brahmins, Bharadvaja and Vasettha, [...] are {{training}} with the monks (bhikkhu) and aim {{to be a member}} of the Sangha. As usual in the evening, the Buddha rises from his meditation and strolls in the open yard near his dwelling. Vasettha sees his Teacher strolling, tells his friend, Bharadvaja, and suggests that they meet the Buddha to see if <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> a Dhamma exposition from the Buddha.|$|E

5|$|In low-duty cycle echolocation, bats can {{separate}} their calls and returning echoes by time. They have to time their short calls to finish before echoes return. This {{is important because}} these bats contract their middle ear muscles when emitting a call, so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> avoid deafening themselves. The time interval between the call and echo allows them to relax these muscles, so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> clearly <b>hear</b> the returning echo. The delay of the returning echoes provides the bat {{with the ability to}} estimate the range to their prey.|$|R

2500|$|The tarsier is the {{smallest}} living primate that exists in several South East Asian countries today. The Philippine tarsier, Tarsius syrichta, locally known as [...] "mamag" [...] in Boholano is near to threatened according to the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. Adaptation to their large bulging eyes allows them to catch prey clearly at night, and with elongated limbs and fingers, leaping {{from tree to tree}} gives no limitation to the tarsier. Their brain is about the same size as their eyes. The connection between its eyes and brain serves a unique function to these animals which is important for their stability and balance. Tarsiers have incredible hearing abilities. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> a frequency of up to 91kHz (kilohertz) and send sounds of 70kHz.|$|E
