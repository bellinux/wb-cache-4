5|$|Bennett was to {{find that}} heading a leading music college was {{incompatible}} with {{a career as a}} composer. The post of Principal was traditionally not arduous. He was contractually required to attend for only six hours a week, teaching composition and arranging class-lists. But Bennett had not only to run <b>the</b> <b>RAM</b> but to save it from imminent dissolution. <b>The</b> <b>RAM</b> had been temporarily saved from bankruptcy by grants from the government, authorised by Gladstone as Chancellor of the Exchequer, in 1864 and 1865. The following year Gladstone was out of office, and the new Chancellor, Disraeli, refused to renew the grant. The directors of <b>the</b> <b>RAM</b> decided to close it, over the head of Bennett as Principal. Bennett, {{with the support of the}} faculty and the students, assumed the Chairmanship of the board of directors.|$|E
5|$|On February 13, 2013, Apple {{announced}} updated {{prices and}} processors for the MacBook Pro with Retina Display and increased <b>the</b> <b>RAM</b> of the high-end 15-inch model to 16 GB.|$|E
5|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>RAM</b> and {{the hard}} drive on some generations of MacBook Pro are user {{serviceable}} parts, there are aftermarket modifications to enhance the system with up to 16GB of DDR3-1600 RAM (maximum capacity and frequency depend on the hardware in question), 7200-rpm hard drives or third party SSDs.|$|E
50|$|In February 2013, <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> and <b>the</b> City of St. Louis went to {{arbitration}} over {{a clause}} in <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> lease that stated <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> current stadium {{must be in}} the top tier of NFL Stadiums. The arbitrators agreed with <b>the</b> <b>Rams,</b> giving <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> <b>the</b> ability to break their original lease and go to a year to year lease agreement.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rams</b> visited {{division}} rival San Francisco 49ers on September 17 {{for their}} home opener. The 49ers increased their winning streak against <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> to three, beating <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> 20–13.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rams</b> {{were forced}} to trade Brudzinski and did so {{in the spring of}} 1981. <b>The</b> <b>Rams</b> {{received}} multiple picks and the top pick was used to draft future star linebacker Jim Collins. With <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> Brudzinski totaled 242 tackles, 9 sacks, and over 20 passes broken up in his 55 games (41 starts) with <b>the</b> <b>Rams.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ram</b> finally {{fell out}} of favour in the 1880s, as the same effect could be {{achieved}} with a torpedo, with less vulnerability to quick-firing guns.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ram</b> {{uses his}} vomeronasal organ (sometimes called the Jacobson's organ) {{to sense the}} pheromones of ewes and detect {{when they are in}} estrus. The ewe uses her vomeronasal organ for early {{recognition}} of her neonate lamb.|$|E
5|$|The {{revival of}} ramming had a {{significant}} effect on naval tactics. Since the 17th century the predominant tactic of naval warfare had been the line of battle, where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its broadside guns. This tactic was totally unsuited to ramming, and <b>the</b> <b>ram</b> threw fleet tactics into disarray. The question of how an ironclad fleet should deploy in battle to make best use of <b>the</b> <b>ram</b> was never tested in battle, and if it had been, combat might have shown that rams could only be used against ships which were already stopped dead in the water.|$|E
50|$|Nixon {{was signed}} to <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> {{practice}} squad joining fellow BYU linebacker Bryan Kehl on <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> roster. Nixon was signed to <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> active roster on December 7, 2010. Nixon was waived on August 6, 2011.|$|R
50|$|Smith {{was signed}} by <b>the</b> St. Louis <b>Rams</b> of <b>the</b> National Football League (NFL) on July 27, 2011 after going undrafted in the 2011 NFL Draft. He was {{released}} by <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> on August 8, 2011. He {{was signed by}} <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> on November 16, 2011. Smith appeared in three games for <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> in 2011, recording three tackles. He was released by <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> on April 30, 2012.|$|R
25|$|On April 18, 2007 <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> signed punter Donnie Jones to {{a five-year}} $5.59 million deal. <b>The</b> <b>Rams</b> also {{gave up a}} seventh round draft choice to the Miami Dolphins for Jones. Sander was {{released}} from <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> two days later.|$|R
5|$|HMS Hotspur was {{inspired}} by a series of French coast-defence ships with <b>the</b> <b>ram</b> as their primary weapon. The layout of Glatton was modified with a fixed turret and her freeboard was increased over that of the older ship. The single 12-inch gun was mounted on a turntable and could pivot at each gun port to maximise its arc of fire. It was nominally capable of firing forward, but this proved to damage the upper deck.|$|E
5|$|In 1858 Bennett {{returned}} to composition, but his later works, though popular, were considered old-fashioned {{and did not}} arouse as much critical enthusiasm as his youthful compositions had done. He was Professor of Music at the University of Cambridge from 1856 to 1866. In that year he became Principal of <b>the</b> <b>RAM,</b> rescuing it from closure, and remained in this position until his death. He was knighted in 1871. He died in London in 1875 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Krokom Municipality {{was formed}} in 1974 and bears arms granted in 1977, {{featuring}} a ram (gumsen) based on a 6000-year-old rock carving at Glösabäcken. <b>The</b> <b>ram</b> seen here {{was included in the}} seal of the legislature of Rödön from 1658. While petroglyphs long predate heraldry, they rarely appear in heraldic armory. Blazon: Argent, a chevron gemel wavy inverted and diminished azure, beneath a ram {{in the manner of a}} rock carving gules.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, he led <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> to an 8-5-5 record, {{marking the}} school's first winning season since 1998. In 2006, he led <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> to an {{impressive}} 9-3-5 record, leading <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> {{to a national}} ranking as high as 12th.|$|R
50|$|On April 18, 2007 <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> signed punter Donnie Jones to {{a five-year}} $5.59 million deal. <b>The</b> <b>Rams</b> also {{gave up a}} seventh round draft choice to the Miami Dolphins for Jones. Sander was {{released}} from <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> two days later.|$|R
25|$|On {{opening day}} of the free agency, <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> traded a fifth round draft choice to the Detroit Lions for James Hall. On March 3, 2007, <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> signed Drew Bennett to a six-year, $30 million deal. Unrestricted free agents Todd Steussie and Travis Minor re-signed with <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> each for a one-year deal. <b>The</b> <b>Rams</b> {{acquired}} B.J. Sander in case the team lost Matt Turk. On March 8, 2007, <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> signed Randy McMichael to a three-year contract and acquired Todd Johnson from the Chicago Bears who signed a four-year contract. On March 21, 2007, <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> signed Randy McMichael to a three-year deal. On March 26, 2007, Marshall Faulk announced his retirement from the NFL.|$|R
5|$|Navies {{experimented with}} the {{positioning}} of guns, in turrets (like the USS Monitor), central-batteries or barbettes, or with <b>the</b> <b>ram</b> {{as the principal}} weapon. As steam technology developed, masts were gradually removed from battleship designs. By the mid-1870s steel {{was used as a}} construction material alongside iron and wood. The French Navy's , laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876, was a central battery and barbette warship which became the first battleship in the world to use steel as the principal building material.|$|E
5|$|The {{polycarbonate}} Intel MacBook {{is easier}} for users to fix or upgrade than its predecessor. Where the iBook required substantial disassembly to access internal components such as the hard drive, users only need to remove the battery and <b>the</b> <b>RAM</b> door to replace the MacBook drive. Apple provides do-it-yourself manuals for these tasks.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} ancient Greek {{references}} to sheep: that of Chrysomallos, the golden-fleeced ram, continuing {{to be told}} through into the modern era. Astrologically, Aries, <b>the</b> <b>ram,</b> is {{the first sign of}} the classical Greek zodiac, and the sheep is the eighth of the twelve animals associated with the 12-year cycle of in the Chinese zodiac, related to the Chinese calendar. In Mongolia, shagai are an ancient form of dice made from the cuboid bones of sheep that are often used for fortunetelling purposes.|$|E
50|$|The {{regular season}} began with <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> hosting <b>the</b> Saint Francis Red Flash on November 11. In a close affair, <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> earned a 63-57 {{victory over the}} Red Flash {{to open up the}} season. Despite the opening victory, <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> lost their second two games of the season, both at neutral venues during the Charleston Classic, losing to Seton Hall and Georgia Tech. Against Tech, <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> held an eight-point lead at halftime, before relinquishing the lead in the second half. Bradford Burgess led <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> in scoring, with 17 points. Their final game of the Classic ended in a five-point victory over Western Kentucky Hilltoppers. On November 23, <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> played <b>the</b> Hilltoppers again, this time in an intra-conference early season game, and still picked up a victory. Burgess once again led <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> in scoring, with 16 points.|$|R
50|$|Hughes {{signed with}} <b>the</b> St. Louis <b>Rams</b> July 29, 2011. He was {{released}} by <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> on September 3 and signed to the team's practice squad on September 4, 2011. He played in three games for <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> in 2011. Hughes {{was released by}} <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> on August 27, 2012.|$|R
50|$|The Carroll Rosenbloom Memorial Award {{is given}} to <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> rookie of <b>the</b> year as {{determined}} by the players and coaches. The reward is named after the former owner of <b>the</b> <b>Rams.</b> Rosenbloom was <b>the</b> owner of <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> from 1972 until 1978.|$|R
5|$|Unlike the {{warships}} of Antiquity, Byzantine and Arab ships did not feature rams, and {{the primary}} means of ship-to-ship combat were boarding actions and missile fire, {{as well as the}} use of inflammable materials such as Greek fire. Despite the fearsome reputation of the latter, it was only effective under certain circumstances, and not the decisive anti-ship weapon that <b>the</b> <b>ram</b> had been in the hands of experienced crews.|$|E
5|$|Vertical {{broaching}} machines {{can be designed}} for push broaching, pull-down broaching, pull-up broaching, or surface broaching. Push {{broaching machines}} are similar to an arbor press with a guided ram; typical capacities are 5 to 50 tons. The two ram pull-down machine {{is the most common}} type of broaching machine. This style machine has the rams under the table. Pull-up machines have <b>the</b> <b>ram</b> above the table; they usually have more than one ram. Most surface broaching is done on a vertical machine.|$|E
5|$|Across England, {{many public}} houses and inns were renamed after Daniel Lambert, {{particularly}} in Leicester and Stamford. The Daniel Lambert public house at 12 Ludgate Hill, {{near the entrance}} to St Paul's Cathedral in London, was well known, and had a large portrait of Daniel Lambert and Lambert's walking stick on display in the lobby. James Dixon, owner of <b>the</b> <b>Ram</b> Jam Inn in Stamford, bought the suit of clothes Lambert had been wearing when he died and put it on display, renaming the inn the Daniel Lambert.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rams</b> signed Giordano on June 15, 2013 after <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> {{released}} rookie {{free agent}} safety Don Unamba.|$|R
50|$|With <b>the</b> loss, <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> {{dropped to}} 4-8. A day after, <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> fired {{offensive}} coordinator Frank Cignetti.|$|R
5000|$|On 15 August 2014, Mark Dickel was {{appointed}} {{head coach of}} <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> after signing a two-year deal. On 5 December 2014, <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> re-signed star point guard Jeremy Kench, promising swingman Ethan Rusbatch, and [...] "Mr Intangibles" [...] Marty Davison. The team also nabbed combo guard Tony Tolovae, who like Dickel and forward Marques Whippy, joined <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> from <b>the</b> defunct Otago Nuggets. On 17 January 2015, <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> announced American swingman Kyle Coston as their first import for the 2015 season. The team also announced the signings of youngsters Sam Timmins, Joe Cook-Green and Jackson Stent. On 9 February 2015, <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> snared {{one of the most}} highly credentialed players {{in the history of the}} NBL by signing former NBA big man Mickell Gladness. <b>The</b> <b>Rams</b> also announced <b>the</b> re-signing of 2014 Rookie of the Year Richie Edwards. On 28 April 2015, <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> released Coston just seven games into the season and replaced him with Jermaine Taylor, another former NBA player. Despite a talented squad, <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> finished <b>the</b> 2015 season outside the top four with a 9-9 record.|$|R
5|$|Although Aries came to {{represent}} specifically <b>the</b> <b>ram</b> whose fleece became the Golden Fleece of Ancient Greek mythology, it has represented a ram since late Babylonian times. Before that, {{the stars of}} Aries formed a farmhand. Different cultures have incorporated the stars of Aries into different constellations including twin inspectors in China and a porpoise in the Marshall Islands. Aries is a relatively dim constellation, possessing only four bright stars: Hamal (Alpha Arietis, second magnitude), Sheratan (Beta Arietis, third magnitude), Mesarthim (Gamma Arietis, fourth magnitude), and 41 Arietis (also fourth magnitude). The few deep-sky objects within the constellation are quite faint and include several pairs of interacting galaxies. Several meteor showers appear to radiate from Aries, including the Daytime Arietids and the Epsilon Arietids.|$|E
5|$|Bennett left a {{substantial}} music library, {{a large proportion}} of which is owned by his great-great-grandson Barry Sterndale Bennett (b. 1939) and is on deposit at the Bodleian Library in Oxford. Of his total of some 130 compositions, about a quarter have been recorded for CD; among these are symphonies, overtures, piano concerti, chamber music, songs and piano solo music. During his bicentenary year of 2016, several concerts and events dedicated to Bennett's works were performed, including concerts and seminars at <b>the</b> <b>RAM.</b> From April 11 to April 15 2016 he was featured as 'Composer of the Week' on BBC Radio 3.|$|E
5|$|Bennett {{received}} honorary {{degrees from}} the universities of Cambridge (1867) and Oxford (1870). The Philharmonic Society awarded him its Beethoven gold medal in 1867. In 1871 he was knighted by Queen Victoria (two years after his old antagonist Costa had been accorded the same honour), and in 1872 he received a public testimonial before a large audience at St James's Hall, London. The money subscribed at this event founded a scholarship and prize at <b>the</b> <b>RAM,</b> which is still awarded. An English Heritage blue plaque has been placed at the house in 38 Queensborough Terrace, London, where Bennett lived during many of his later years.|$|E
50|$|He {{was drafted}} by <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> in <b>the</b> seventh round of the 2008 NFL Draft on April 27, 2008. On July 20, 2008, Chamberlain signed a three-year $1.186 million {{contract}} with <b>the</b> <b>Rams.</b> Chamberlain led <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> in special teams tackles in 2008 with 19.|$|R
50|$|The Seahawks {{win over}} Cleveland in Week 15 {{eliminated}} <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> from playoff contention for the 11th consecutive season. <b>The</b> <b>Rams</b> {{were able to}} sweep their division rival, the Seattle Seahawks in their regular season series. The last time <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> did this was 2004.|$|R
2500|$|From 1933, when Joe Lillard {{left the}} Chicago Cardinals, through 1946, {{there were no}} Black players in {{professional}} American football. After <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> had received approval to move to Los Angeles, <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> entered into negotiations to lease the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. <b>The</b> <b>Rams</b> were advised that a precondition to them getting a lease was {{that they would have}} to integrate the team with at least one African-American; <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> agreed to this condition. Subsequently, <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> signed Kenny Washington on March 21, 1946. The signing of Washington caused [...] "all hell to break loose" [...] among the owners of the NFL franchises. <b>The</b> <b>Rams</b> added a second black player, Woody Strode, on May 7, 1946, giving them two black players going into the 1946 season.|$|R
