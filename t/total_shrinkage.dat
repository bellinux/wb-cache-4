50|$|One unusual {{feature of}} Mercury's surface is the {{numerous}} compression folds, or rupes, that crisscross the plains. As Mercury's interior cooled, it contracted and its surface began to deform, creating wrinkle ridges and lobate scarps associated with thrust faults. The scarps can reach lengths of 1000 km and heights of 3 km. These compressional features {{can be seen}} on top of other features, such as craters and smooth plains, indicating they are more recent. Mapping of the features has suggested a <b>total</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of Mercury's radius in the range of ~1 to 7 km. Small-scale thrust fault scarps have been found, tens of meters in height and with lengths in the range of a few km, that appear to be less than 50 million years old, indicating that compression of the interior and consequent surface geological activity continue to the present.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Collapse-type {{shrinkage}} is {{the greatest}} obstacle to prevent planted eucalypts from being used for solid wood products. In {{order to make the}} suitable drying schedules for high effective utilization of eucalypt wood, the <b>total</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and collapse on two species of difficult-to-dry E. urophylla and E. grandis wood under continuous and intermittent drying regimes were measured. The results show that <b>total</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and collapse in both eucalypts exhibited higher values for continuous drying than intermittent drying. With increasing drying temperature, <b>total</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and collapse increase in both drying regimes, while the increasing magnitude of both parameters becomes apparently larger for continuous drying than intermittent drying regime, in particular higher temperature condition. Properly elevating drying temperature {{to make up for the}} intermittent-waiting time may be allowed for intermittent drying regime. Drying duration at each intermittent drying period has a greater effect on <b>total</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and collapse of eucalypt wood. When more than a drying duration of 6 hours at an intermittent drying period is used, the differences in shrinkage and collapse between both drying regimes are very slight. Intermittent duration at an intermittent drying period has a comparatively larger effect on <b>total</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and collapse. Accordingly, we may draw a conclusion that intermittent drying regime is very likely to be a potential drying one suitable for collapse-prone lower-density plantation-grown eucalypt wood...|$|E

The common inference that shrinkage stress effects will be reduced in teeth restored with such restoratives with lower shrinkage was tested in extracted human premolars. Mesio-occluso-distal slot-shaped cavities were cut and restored with a conventional (SupremePlus) or low-shrink (RefleXions, Premise, Kalore, and LS) composite (N = 5). We digitized the coronal surfaces before and 10 min after restoration to determine cuspal deflection from the buccal and lingual volume change/area. We also determined the main properties involved (<b>total</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> post-gel shrinkage, degree of conversion, and elastic modulus), as well as microleakage, to verify adequate bonding. It was shown that, due to shrinkage stresses, buccal and lingual surfaces pulled inward after restoration (9 - 14 microns). Only Kalore and LS resulted in significantly lower tooth deformation (ANOVA/Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc, p = 0. 05). The other two low-shrink composites, despite having the lowest and highest <b>total</b> <b>shrinkage</b> values, did not cause significant differences in cuspal deflection. Deflection seemed most related to the combination of post-gel shrinkage and elastic modulus.

The correlation coefficients were also determined and the corresponding regression equations were established with the anatomical parameters measured by using multiple linear regression. The results indicated that: (1) basic density was strongly positively linearly related to both unit tangential shrinkage (r = 0.970) and unit radial shrinkage (r = 0.959), weakly positively related to <b>total</b> <b>shrinkage</b> (r = 0.656 and 0.640 for tangential and radial, respectively), and weakly negatively related to residual collapse (r = 0.632 and 0.616 for tangential and radial, respectively). (2) The main factors affecting unit shrinkage were cell wall proportion (WP), microfibril angle (MFA), and double fiber cell wall thickness (DWT); factors playing an important role in <b>total</b> <b>shrinkage</b> were WP, ray parenchyma proportion (RP), and MFA, while RP had the highest effect on residual collapse (r = 0.949 and 0.860 for tangential and radial, respectively).

40|$|Plum (Prunus domestica L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} species of fruit trees in South-East Europe. Because of its fruits, it has been cultivated for centuries. The emergence of plum pox virus caused the disappearance of a large number of „old“ plum sorts. There is no chemical agent to combat plum pox virus, and the only way to prevent the spread of the virus is to destroy plantations. For this reason there is a large amount of wood mass that can be used for industrial purposes. In Croatia, over the past years we have witnessed this process that slowly spreads along the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina and other countries in the region. In this research some physical and mechanical properties were studied of plum wood from middle Bosnia and Herzegovina. The results of this research can be used to determine technological properties of plum wood. The physical properties of plum wood that were studied are as follows: density in absolutely dry condition, nominal density, total longitudinal, radial, tangential and volumetric shrinkage. The mechanical property of plum wood that was studied is: ultimate tensile stress parallel to the grain. From macroscopic characteristics, growth ring was measured for the correlation with the studied physical and mechanical properties of plum wood.

Methods. Seven BisGMA-based composites (Durafill/DU, Filtek Z 250 /FZ, Heliomolar/HM, Aelite LS Posterior/AP, Point 4 /P 4, Filtek Supreme/SU, ELS/EL), a silorane-based (Filtek LS, LS), a urethane-based (Venus Diamond, VD) and {{one based on}} a dimethacrylate-derivative of dimer acid (N`Durance, ND) were tested. Polymerization stress was determined in 1 -mm high specimens inserted between two PMMA rods attached to a universal testing machine. <b>Total</b> volumetric <b>shrinkage</b> was measured using a mercury dilatometer. Maximum shrinkage rate {{was used as a}} parameter of the reaction speed. Post-gel shrinkage was measured using strain-gages. Elastic modulus was obtained by three-point bending. Data were submitted to one-way ANOVA/Tukey test (p = 0. 05), except for elastic modulus (Kruskal-Wallis). Results. Composites ranked differently for <b>total</b> and post-gel <b>shrinkage.</b> Among the materials considered as ""low-shrinkage"" by the respective manufacturers, LS, EL and VD presented low post-gel shrinkage, while AP and ND presented relatively high values. Polymerization stress showed a strong correlation with post-gel shrinkage except for LS, which presented high stress. Elastic modulus and shrinkage rate showed weak relationships with polymerization stress. Significance. Not all low-shrinkage composites demonstrated reduced polymerization shrinkage. Also, in order to effectively reduce polymerization stress, a low post-gel shrinkage must be associated to a relatively low elastic modulus. (C) 2010 Academy of Dental Materials.

A series of CFRP laminates were prepared by the RTM technique varying the fibre volume content (30 to 60 %), reinforcement material (woven fabrics vs. unidirectional fibre reinforcements), curing temperatures (40 °C to 120 °C), additives (SiO 2 nanoparticles as matrix fillers) and using a surface finish applied as an in-mould coating.

The studied material came from Votorantim Metais Zinco S. A., and the plantations, located in Vazante, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, were six years old. Six trees were harvested from which were cut two logs with three meter long each. Those logs were sawed into thick diametral slabs.

Microfibril angle (MFA) and cellulose crystallite width (Wcryst), typical routine measurements from SilviScan, were determined from strip specimens that were end-matched with the wood block specimens. Simple and multiple relationships between these properties were examined. The potential of using the SilviScan measurements to predict various shrinkage properties, in particular tangential collapse, was investigated. It was found that several shrinkage properties were significantly correlated with microfibril angle and Wcryst. However, microfibril angle had a direct effect (negative) only on tangential shrinkage and cross-sectional shrinkage, and Wcryst had a direct effect (positive) only on radial collapse. Density, microfibril angle, and Wcryst, either singly or collectively, accounted for a small to modest amount of variation in shrinkage and collapse in both the radial and tangential directions. <b>Total</b> tangential <b>shrinkage</b> {{was found to be}} the best single predictor for tangential collapse (r 2 = 0. 896) and for <b>total</b> cross-sectional <b>shrinkage</b> (r 2 = 0. 924).

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis focuses on setting the behavior and shrinkage properties of high-performance pavement concrete and the effect factors, such as supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), chemical admixtures, and temperature. The thesis consists of two papers: (1) the relation between setting behavior and the maturity of pavement concrete materials and (2) a simple statistical model to predict the shrinkage behavior of high-performance concrete containing supplementary cementitious materials. In paper 1, setting behaviour and maturity of six different concrete mixtures under three different curing temperatures (18. 3, 23. 9, and 29. 4 C, corresponding to 65, 75 and 85 oF) were investigated. The mixtures were made with two different retarders (ASTM Types B and D) and with 0 or 20 % Class C fly ash replacement for Type I cement. The initial and final set times of these mixtures were measured by the penetration resistance method according to ASTM C 403. The temperature rise of the mixtures was monitored using a thermal couple, and the concrete maturity was then computed based on the time- temperature factor (TTF). A new approach is introduced for predicting concrete set time (penetration resistance) based on the concrete maturity (time-temperature factor). The results indicate that concrete penetration resistance well correlates with maturity measurements. This relationship enables engineers to assess setting behaviour of field concrete on site. In paper 2, autogenous shrinkage and free drying shrinkage of nine different high performance concrete mixtures used for bridge decks and bridge overlays constructions were measured, and the <b>total</b> <b>shrinkage</b> (defined as autogenous shrinkage plus free drying shrinkage) was studied. The mixtures were systemically designed for evaluating effects of class C fly ash and ground granulated blast-furance slag replacement on shrinkage proporties. A simplified exponential model ɛauto/drying(t) =a+b*e(c*t) was introduced for describing and predicting shrinkage in high-performance concrete when different types and amounts of supplementary cementitious materials were used. This model fits for both autogenous and free drying shrinkage and is validated and proved by comparing measured value with predicted shrinkage value of an independent group of mixtures. The results indicate that compare to GGBF slag, fly ash performs much better to reduce the <b>total</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> Additionally, free drying shrinkage increases linearly with autogenous shrinkage between 0 and 14 days. The {{results of the present}} study indicate that the concrete maturity method successfully describes the concrete setting behavior; and the exponential model successfully predicts the shrinkage behavior of high-performance concrete with SCMs. Additionally, the results indicate Class C fly ash replacement can reduce the <b>total</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and extend the setting time of high-performance concrete.

Mean density in absolutely dry condition of researched olive wood is 0. 810 g/cm 3 while the average value of teak wood is 0. 610 g/cm 3. Regardless of higher density, the mean value of total tangential shrinkage for olive wood is only by 3. 6 % higher than the one for teak wood, so the value for olive wood is 5. 6 % and for teak wood 5. 4 %. Based on this research of density in absolutely dry condition and <b>total</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> olive wood {{can be considered as}} a possible alternative indigenous species for use in products that are daily exposed to external conditions...|$|E
30|$|As {{regards the}} species that were {{harvested}} in several sites (Table  1), one-way ANOVA, at 95  % confidence level, was performed to test the site effect on <b>total</b> leaf <b>shrinkage.</b> The test showed no significant effect for most of these species with p values varying from 0.128 (A. unedo) to 0.354 (C. monspeliensis) except for P. canariensis and P. lentiscus, for which p value =  0.000. The three sites where P. canariensis needles were sampled indicated all statistical differences. This is due to anatomical differences in P. canariensis needles, owing to the environmental conditions variability (Grill et al. 2004). Regarding the leaves of P. lentiscus, only one site (Dardara) was {{significantly different from the}} other sites (Ahl Srif and Souk L’Qolla), considered similar. According to Barazani et al. (2003), there is a high polymorphism in P. lentiscus leaves. This warrants the significant shrinkage differences observed between certain sites.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This study {{concerned}} {{the temperature and}} linear dimensional change of heat-cured acrylic resin in the two-stage processing technique for complete dentures. Methods: Thermocouples were incorporated in the acrylic resin for recording temperatures. Measurements between reference marks were made by a high-resolution digital measuring microscope. Results: No increase in temperature associated with the exothermic nature of the polymerization reaction was recorded. The {{temperature of the resin}} followed the waterbath temperature closely. The temperatures recorded at various regions were in phase with each other. The <b>total</b> linear <b>shrinkage</b> of the base after two processing cycles was less than 1 % and compares favourably with studies on the single-stage processing technique. Conclusions: Temperature differential is excluded as a reason for the warpage of dentures. The dimensional changes of the denture base resulting from the two-stage processing technique cannot be considered to be of any clinical significance. © 1995. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change has}} a {{perceived}} threat on biodiversity {{due to its}} effect on species range.   Species with narrow ranges and highly specific climatic and habitat requirements are at higher risk.   To understand the influence of climate change on the Indian endemic gekkonid, the Indian Golden Gecko Calodactylodes aureus (Beddome, 1870) we model {{the present and future}} predicted distribution (2050 and 2070) under the CMIP 5 RCP 4. 5 and RCP 8. 5 scenarios using MaxEnt under the HadGEM 3 -ES Model.   Our analysis revealed the negative impact of climate change on the Indian Golden Gecko with a decrease in the amount of climatically suitable areas in the future, and an almost <b>total</b> range <b>shrinkage</b> by 2070.   Despite its wide distribution in the eastern Deccan Peninsula, according to our predictions, the species is threatened by a shrinkage in the future range due to climate change.  </div...|$|R
