5|$|Chennai {{was officially}} {{declared}} a disaster {{area on the}} evening of 2 December. At the MIOT Hospital, 14 patients died after power and oxygen supplies failed. With a letup in rainfall, floodwaters gradually began to recede in Chennai on 4 December, though 40 percent of the city's districts remained submerged and safe food and drinking water remained in short supply. Though relief efforts were well underway across most of the area by 3 December, the lack of any coordinated relief response in North Chennai forced thousands of its residents to evacuate on their own. As intermittent rains returned, thousands of displaced residents from Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts attempted to flee the stricken region by bus or train and travel to their family homes. Chennai International Airport was partly reopened for cargo flights on 5 December, with passenger flights scheduled to resume from the following morning. By 6 December, rescue efforts had largely concluded and relief efforts intensified, with the Chennai Corporation beginning <b>to</b> <b>disburse</b> relief packages. Mobile, banking and power services were gradually restored; fuel and food supplies were reaching their destinations, the airport had fully reopened and rail services slowly resumed. Many city neighbourhoods, however, remained flooded with some lacking basic necessities due to the uncoordinated distribution of relief materials. With the city slowly beginning to recover, state and national health officials remained watchful against disease outbreaks, warning that conditions were right for epidemics of water-borne illnesses to occur. Chennai Corporation officials reported at least 57,000 homes in the city had suffered structural damage, mostly those of working class pincodes. State housing boards said they would conduct safety inspections of both public and residential buildings. After being closed for the past month, schools and colleges across the affected districts began to reopen from 14 December. Relief operations were largely wound up by 19 December.|$|E

2500|$|The Plaintiff, John Jordan, in a {{class action}} suit, sued Illinois {{officials}} who administered federal-state of Aid to the Aged, Blind, or Disabled (AABD). Jordan alleged that the program monies had been administered {{in a way that}} violated both federal laws and the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Specifically, Jordan claimed that the Illinois administrators were applying their own guidelines which ignored federally mandated time limits, thereby not getting aid to applicants fast enough. The federal law required that applicants who qualify receive aid within 30 or 45 days, depending on their condition, but the Illinois agency was taking up to four months <b>to</b> <b>disburse</b> aid - and when such aid was distributed, it was not paid retroactively to the time when the state should have started paying it according to the federal guidelines.|$|E
2500|$|Special {{provisions}} {{are made in}} some states for determining the priority between a mechanic's lien and the lien of a mortgage that is financing the construction on the land. [...] For instance, in the State of New York, the appearance of specified language in the mortgage {{to the effect that}} it is a construction loan preserves its priority over mechanic's liens arising out of the construction, as long as subsequently filed lien claims that are legitimate are not ignored. [...] In other states, such as Florida, it is an all or nothing proposition. [...] There, the recording of the construction mortgage before the filing of a statutory notice of commencement of construction provides the mortgage with absolute priority over mechanic's liens arising out of the construction. [...] Still other states, such as California, provide priority for a construction loan mortgage recorded before the visible commencement of construction where the lender is obligated <b>to</b> <b>disburse</b> the funds. [...] In the State of Illinois, there is a statutory funds disbursing scheme that, if followed, provides construction loan mortgage priority. [...] In other states, there are still other arrangements and some states, such as Colorado, provide almost no practical means for a construction loan mortgage to obtain priority at all.|$|E
