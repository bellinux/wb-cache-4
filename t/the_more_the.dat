5|$|For galaxies {{more distant}} than the Local Group {{and the nearby}} Virgo Cluster, but within a {{thousand}} megaparsecs or so, the redshift is approximately proportional to the galaxy's distance. This correlation was first observed by Edwin Hubble and {{has come to be}} known as Hubble's law. Vesto Slipher was the first to discover galactic redshifts, in about the year 1912, while Hubble correlated Slipher's measurements with distances he measured by other means to formulate his Law. In the widely accepted cosmological model based on general relativity, redshift is mainly a result of the expansion of space: this means that the farther away a galaxy is from us, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>the</b> space has expanded in the time since the light left that galaxy, so <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>the</b> light has been stretched, the more redshifted the light is, and so the faster it appears to be moving away from us. Hubble's law follows in part from the Copernican principle. Because it is usually not known how luminous objects are, measuring the redshift is easier than more direct distance measurements, so redshift is sometimes in practice converted to a crude distance measurement using Hubble's law.|$|E

5|$|The use of {{lead for}} water pipes is {{problematic}} {{in areas with}} soft or acidic water. Hard water forms insoluble layers in the pipes whereas soft and acidic water dissolves the lead pipes. Dissolved {{carbon dioxide in the}} carried water may result in the formation of soluble lead bicarbonate; oxygenated water may similarly dissolve lead as lead(II) hydroxide. Drinking such water, over time, can cause health problems due to the toxicity of the dissolved lead. The harder the water the more calcium bicarbonate and sulfate it will contain, and <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>the</b> inside of the pipes will be coated with a protective layer of lead carbonate or lead sulfate.|$|E

25|$|The damper, {{instead of}} storing energy, dissipates energy. Since the damping force is {{proportional}} to the velocity, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>the</b> motion, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>the</b> damper dissipates the energy. Therefore, there is a point when the energy dissipated by the damper equals the energy added by the force. At this point, the system has reached its maximum amplitude and will continue to vibrate at this level as long as the force applied stays the same. If no damping exists, there is nothing to dissipate the energy and, theoretically, the motion will continue to grow into infinity.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the dependence of the anti-acetylcholinesterase, insecticidal activities and hydrolysis rate upon the substituents at the phosphorus atom and p-position relative to the phenyl ester group of saligenin cyclic phosphorothionates and phosphates, regression analysis was applied to the representative salithion (2 -methoxy- 4 H- 1, 3, 2 -benzodioxaphosphorin 2 -sulfide) and salioxon (2 -methoxy- 4 H- 1, 3, 2 -benzodioxaphosphorin 2 -oxide) analogs. For the insecticidal activity of salithion analogs, steric parameter was important in transport process of the compounds to the biological site of action {{as well as in the}} interaction with the site : the smaller the substituent at the phosphorus atom and <b>the</b> p-position, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> potent <b>the</b> insecticidal activity.

25|$|Image {{rejection}} is {{an important}} factor in choosing the intermediate frequency of a receiver.

25|$|In {{the case}} of an n-type switch, the body is {{connected}} to the most negative supply (usually GND) and the gate is used as the switch control. Whenever the gate voltage exceeds the source voltage by at least a threshold voltage, the MOSFET conducts. The higher the voltage, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>the</b> MOSFET can conduct. An N-MOS switch passes all voltages less than Vgate–Vtn. When the switch is conducting, it typically operates in the linear (or ohmic) mode of operation, since the source and drain voltages will typically be nearly equal.|$|E
