5|$|Bonstelle {{sold her}} {{stake in the}} Garrick <b>Theater</b> in 1924. She and her company founded the Bonstelle Playhouse in Detroit, which opened on January 1, 1925.

At first she carried on producing mostly Broadway-style plays. However, the company did perform classics, including modern-dress productions of Romeo and Juliet in 1926 and Hamlet in 1927, {{among the first to}} put on such performances. In February 1928 Bonstelle began a campaign to gain community support for the <b>theater.</b> A fund of over $200,000 was raised by donations from the public and Bonstelle made an agreement with local authorities to make the playhouse the city's unofficial premier <b>theater.</b> Later that year the group became known as the Detroit Civic <b>Theater.</b> In her plan for the <b>theater</b> she emphasized the importance of providing the public with the best drama, including both classics and modern works, and improving young people's knowledge of dramatic literature. Funded by public subscription, it had ticket prices as low as $1.50. Performances included works by Shakespeare, Henrik Ibsen and Richard Brinsley Sheridan. The <b>theater</b> also played a religious role. Bonstelle used it in an effort to improve understanding and co-operation between the church and the <b>theater,</b> holding multi-denominational religious services there during Lent, and she stated that her plays, while avoiding being preachy, were intended to have a positive moral influence on the audience. Local clergy publicly praised her work with the <b>theater.</b>|$|E
