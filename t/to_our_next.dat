Horner {{was reported to have}} been committed to the Avatar franchise; Cameron said he and Horner [...] "were looking forward <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> gig." [...] Horner's assistant, Sylvia Patrycja, wrote on her Facebook page, [...] "We have lost an amazing person with a huge heart and unbelievable talent [...] died doing what he loved." [...] Many celebrities, including Russell Crowe, Diane Warren and Celine Dion, also gave their condolences. Dion, who sang [...] "My Heart Will Go On", one of Horner's most popular compositions and considered Dion's signature song, wrote on her website that she and husband René Angélil were [...] "shaken by the tragic death" [...] of their friend and [...] "will always remember his kindness and great talent that changed [...] career." [...] Leona Lewis, who recorded Horner's [...] "I See You" [...] for Avatar, said working with him [...] "was one of the biggest moments of my life." ...|$|E

60|$|When {{we reached}} home, {{after a series}} of petty but {{provoking}} accidents,[25] we first locked up the mummy very carefully in the spare bedroom. To-morrow would be time enough, we said, to consult the wizard as <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> movement. We ordered a repast of the native viands (which included, I remember, a small but savoury fish, the Blô-ta), and sought our couches, in better spirits than usual.|$|E
6000|$|Dear Sir,--In [...] "Horace in London" [...] [1] I {{perceive}} some stanzas on Lord Elgin {{in which}} (waving the kind compliment to myself [2]) I heartily concur. I wish I {{had the pleasure}} of Mr. Smith's acquaintance, as I could communicate the curious anecdote you read in Mr. T.'s letter. If he would like it, he can have the substance for his second Edition; if not, I shall add it <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>next,</b> though I think we already have enough of Lord Elgin.|$|E

[...] said Bothwell, {{aside to}} him; [...] "cannot you see she's better where she is, {{so long as}} there is a respectable, sponsible, money-broking heritor, like Mr Morton of Milnwood, who has the means of atoning her trespasses? Let the old mother fly to raise another brood, she's too tough to be made any thing of herself--Here," [...] he cried, [...] "one other round to Milnwood and his roof-tree, and <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> merry meeting with him!--which I think will not be far distant, if he keeps such a fanatical family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then,' {{said the}} child, 'we often {{walked in the}} fields and among the green trees, and when we came home at night, we liked it better for being tired, and said what a happy place it was. And if it was dark and rather dull, we used to say, what did it matter to us, for it only made us {{remember}} our last walk with greater pleasure, and look forward <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> one. But now we never have these walks, and though it is the same house it is darker and much more gloomy than it used to be, indeed!' ...|$|E
6000|$|He sat down, looking rather {{spent with}} his effort, {{and on the}} way <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> stop, at the Temple of Neptune, the agent {{examined}} us upon our necessities in the article of language. He himself spoke such good English that we could not do otherwise than declare that we could get on perfectly with an address in French. The German pair, perhaps from patriotic grudge, denied a working knowledge of the unfriendly tongue. The solitary on the back seat, being asked in his turn, graciously answered, [...] "Toutes les langues me sont egales," [...] and thereafter we suffered with the orator only through French and German.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, but it is, though,' said Una quickly. 'We haven't begun German yet, and--and we're {{going back}} <b>to</b> <b>our</b> French <b>next</b> week.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'You won't if you {{can help}} it, of course,' he said, 'but I think you'll find him a little too much for your gravity. However, that's neither here nor there, and it {{certainly}} is not the letter; which ends thus: [...] "Knowing that I need not impress {{the nature and extent of}} that confidence upon you at any greater length, as it is already sufficiently established in your mind, I will only say, in bidding you farewell and looking forward <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> meeting, that I shall charge myself from this time, through all changes for the better, with your advancement and happiness, as if they were my own. You may rely upon that. And always believe me, my dear Tom Pinch, faithfully your friend, Martin Chuzzlewit. P.S.--I enclose the amount which you so kindly"--Oh,' said Martin, checking himself, and folding up the letter, 'that's nothing!' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{result of}} all these {{deliberations}} was that I temporized: I would not, I could not, give up the rides and rambles that took up most of my time, but I would try to overcome my disinclination to serious reading. There were plenty of books in the house-it was always a puzzle to me how we came to have so many. I was familiar with their appearance on the shelves-they had been before me since I first opened my eyes---their shape, size, colour, even their titles, {{and that was all}} I knew about them. A general Natural History and two little works by James Ronnie on the habits and faculties of birds was all the literature suited to my wants in the entire collection of three or four hundred volumes. For the rest, I had read a few story-books and novels: but we had no novels; when one came into the house it would be read and lent <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> neighbour five or six miles away, and he in turn would lend to another, twenty miles further on, and so on until it disappeared in space.|$|E
60|$|He {{made another}} speech--the man was {{absolutely}} inexhaustible. I closed my eyes--I endeavoured to hear {{as little as}} possible. In spite of my endeavours I was obliged to hear a great deal. My sister's endless husband congratulated himself, and congratulated me, on the result of our interview--he mentioned {{a great deal more}} about his sympathies and mine--he deplored my miserable health--he offered to write me a prescription--he impressed on me the necessity of not forgetting what he had said about the importance of light--he accepted my obliging invitation to rest and lunch--he recommended me to expect Lady Glyde in two or three days' time--he begged my permission to look forward <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> meeting, instead of paining himself and paining me, by saying farewell--he added a great deal more, which, I rejoice to think, I did not attend to at the time, and do not remember now. I heard his sympathetic voice travelling away from me by degrees--but, large as he was, I never heard him. He had the negative merit of being absolutely noiseless. I don't know when he opened the door, or when he shut it. I ventured to make use of my eyes again, after an interval of silence--and he was gone.|$|E
