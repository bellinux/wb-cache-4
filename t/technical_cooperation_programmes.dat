40|$|FOREWORD Radiation {{processing}} {{has been}} applied in many fields of national economy. Sterilization, polymer cross-linking (tapes, tubes, cables, etc.), tyre belt vulcanization, conservation of art objects, and irradiation of selected food items are well established technologies. Two types of irradiators, gamma sources and electron accelerators, are being applied for the process. The International Atomic Energy Agency — through its <b>technical</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>programmes,</b> coordinated research projects, consultants and technical meetings and conferences — is promoting the peaceful use of nuclear science and radiation technologies. Due to the IAEA’s support, some new radiation technologies (e. g. hydrogel wound dressings, sulphur-free radiation vulcanized latex) were developed and transferred to Member States during the past ten years. Special attention {{was given to the}} radiation processing of natural polymers under the framework of the Regional Cooperative Agreement (RCA) for Research, Development and Training Related to Nuclear Science and Technology for East Asia and the Pacific. This region is especially rich in respect to wide variety of indigenous natural polymers, such as chitin/chitosan, carrageenans and alginates...|$|E
40|$|The Alleviating Poverty through Peer Training (APPT) {{project was}} one of the ILO’s <b>technical</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>programmes</b> {{addressing}} the prejudices and barriers faced by people with disabilities when accessing training and employment opportunities. Implemented in Cambodia from October 2002 to September 2007, it aimed to increase the income levels of its clients residing in rural areas with limited training and employment prospects. To achieve this, the project used a methodology called “Success Case Replication” (SCR). SCR is a simple method of village-based informal apprenticeships that involves villagers imparting their skills to a person or group through informal methods. Many income-generating and vocational training projects report that successful training graduates often train others in their skills. This approach is not unique. It is simple, straightforward and operates at the grassroots level. However, by systematizing and adding some components to the process, such as strengthening training or adding access to small grants or loans, the APPT approach to skills transfer increased the likelihood of success and income generation. This manual describes the core elements of the approach which {{was at the heart of}} the APPT project’s success. It is designed to assist organizations and agencies learn how to replicate or adapt the APPT project and the SCR approach that uses local entrepreneurs with proven income-generating activities and small businesses to train others in replicating their businesses. The success of the approach has generated increasing interest and several international and local NGOs in Cambodia have already started replicating it. This manual is part of the Replicating Success Tool Kit developed by the APPT project. Other tools supporting the manual include a video, Replicating success, the APPT database and Management Information System (MIS) used for tracking clients and evaluating the project impact and its accompanying Managing success: An instruction manual for the APPT database and Management Information System, as well as Training for success: A guide for peer trainers...|$|E
40|$|CTA's newly-appointed Director Dr Rodney D Cooke, {{who is from}} Britain, took up {{his duties}} on a {{continuing}} basis in August. Two months earlier he had joined the Centre {{to participate in the}} 1995 annual Advisory Committee meeting and the subsequent CTA seminar on 'The Future Role of Information for Rural Development in ACP Countries' which was held in Montpellier, France. Here Spore provides some background information about Dr Cooke and his initial observations on the challenges now facing the Centre. CTA's new Director arrives at a critical juncture: various internal and external evaluations of CTA's activities have recently been completed and the Montpellier seminar has highlighted some of the expected trends in the next ten years concerning the role of information in rural development. Dr Cooke observed on his arrival in August that 'there are many opportunities and challenges which should enable CTA to further strengthen its services to ACP countries in support of their agriculture and rural development objectives. ' Dr Cooke is well-placed to address these challenges. Since obtaining a PhD in protein chemistry and enzymology from the University of Bristol, UK, he has gained twenty-two years of experience in different aspects of the renewable natural resources sector and rural development in the tropical world. Initially, he worked for the former Tropical Products Institute of the UK as a Project Leader and Programme Manager, where he was concerned with various applied and adaptive research and <b>technical</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>programmes</b> concerning post-harvest technologies and agro-industrial development; he was also involved in long-term and short-term overseas assignments in Latin America, Africa and Asia. In consequence, his second language is Spanish. Dr Cooke has a knowledge of Portuguese. but with a Brazilian flavour, and is fluent in French {{partly as a result of}} his earlier involvement in European-based projects. These activities led him to work with national, regional and international centres, and in Africa this involved work in Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Zambia and Sudan. From 1989 to 1992 Dr Cooke spent much of his time in the UK as a Deputy Director of Britain's Natural Resources Institute (NRI). A major preoccupation was the need to strengthen mid-term planning processes as that institute became the executive agency of the UK Government's Overseas Development Administration (ODA). Dr Cooke was also responsible for NRI's Finance and Central Services Division. From 1992 to 1995 he headed the Natural Resources Management Division, which covered the institute's technical cooperation and applied research programmes in resource assessment and farming systems: forestry, livestock production, agronomy and cropping systems, natural resources assessment methodologies (remote sensing and GIS approaches) and socio-economic aspects. One of his major responsibilities was to develop and strengthen the institute's partnerships with organizations in the developed and developing worlds. Dr Cooke has authored or coauthored over 60 scientific and technical publications. Key issues which Dr Cooke will be, considering with his staff in the coming months are the changing : characteristics and diversity of local, national and regional agricultural system organizations and their evolving requirements for information; the greater emphasis being placed on communication, i. e. two-way exchanges between organizations, beneficiaries and partners rather than the more usual picture of information flow in one direction; the broader need for information as an aid to decision-making, instead of information simply to advance knowledge and understanding; and the enhanced need for a technology 'foresight' role encompassing both the changing picture of ACP needs and also the rapid development of alternative technologies and products. CTA's newly-appointed Director Dr Rodney D Cooke, who is from Britain, took up his duties on a continuing basis in August. Two months earlier he had joined the Centre to participate in the 1995 annual Advisory Committee meeting and the subsequent [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Human {{rights law}} is an {{increasing}} and evolving concept in the international, regional, and national systems and because of using human rights in politics, it is becoming a famous phrase {{that need to be}} discussed thoroughly and to know how the international, regional and national systems for human rights work in cases of violations. In Chapter I I discussed the concept of human rights and I traced the historical development of that concept since the natural law thinking and I also discussed the modern international human rights system which started with the United Nations Charter and the influence of the Universalism and Cultural Relativisms theories on the development of human rights. The development of human rights at the international level was also accompanied by another development at the regional level, and these necessitate discussing those systems mainly, the European, Inter –American and African system for the promotion and protection of human rights. Chapter II discussed the applicable international human rights and humanitarian law. Sometimes we find misunderstanding in differentiating between the two branches of law, and {{in order to understand the}} two systems well, there is a need to know the bodies empowered with observing human rights realization such as the General Assembly, the Security Council, International Court of Justice, General Assembly and the main human rights treaties such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, Convention on the rights of the Child among others and also the relevant treaties relating to humanitarian law. It is not enough to know the relevant human rights treaties, we need to know the relevant machineries responsible of monitoring the realizations of the rights mentioned in those treaties and to see if they are effective or not, and this is discussed in details in Chapter III. The Seven Committees established by the Seven main human rights treaties are: the Human Rights Committee, The Economic, Social and Cultural Committee, Child Rights Committee, Committee Against Torture, Committee on Elimination of Racial Discrimination, Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and the Committee on the Protection of Migrant Workers and their Families. The mandate and functions of these different Committees are mentioned in detail. These treaty-based mechanisms are in real need for reform especially the reporting system and in relation to this point the experience of the International Labour Organization is also discussed. Another important legal development is the establishment of the International Criminal Court. Human rights system is developed at the conventional level and also at the Charter- based level and there are also important mechanisms that monitor the realization and enjoyment of these different rights for all human beings all over the world. These mechanisms are established by the United Nations Charter and they are the General Assembly, the Security Council, The International Court of Justice, and most importantly the Commission on Human Rights. This Commission has different methods of monitoring human rights issues; these are the public 1235 procedure of 1967 and the 1503 procedure of 1970. Recently the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights started playing a major role in human rights issues especially in human rights education, <b>technical</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>programmes</b> and in establishing national human rights institutions. These different mechanisms are using the same methods of monitoring mainly, gathering information, interviewing, visits to persons in detention and reporting. These mechanisms are political bodies, which are considered as one of the main defects in Charter-based monitoring system. Chapter V looks at the most developed regional system, which is the European system for human rights. I discussed the different treaties and mechanisms established to promote and protect human rights in the European countries. In Chapters VI and VII, I have discussed the Inter-American and the African systems respectively. Sudan has been scrutinized since the early 1990 s for its bad human rights records. So Chapter VIII discusses the international and regional obligations of Sudan and the national monitoring system for human rights violations. Under international law any state party to any international treaty has the obligation to harmonize its national laws with its obligations and is also obliged to realize the different rights enumerated in those treaties and to do that Sudan has the duty to establish machineries that protect the individual’s rights under its territory. This Chapter includes the most important mechanisms that is, the Constitutional Court, Advisory Council for Human Rights, regular courts, and the Committee on the Eradication of Abduction of Women and Children. The final Chapter IX is on conclusions and recommendations which will ensure an effective, functioning and reliable system for the promotion and protection of human rights at all levels whether international, regional or national level. Finally, there are four schedules...|$|E
