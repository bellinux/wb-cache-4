500|$|In April 1844, Verdi took on Emanuele Muzio, {{eight years}} his junior, as a pupil and amanuensis. He {{had known him}} since about 1828 as another of Barezzi's protégés. Muzio, who in fact was Verdi's only pupil, became {{indispensable}} to the composer. He reported to Barezzi that Verdi [...] "has a breadth of spirit, of generosity, a wisdom." [...] In November 1846, Muzio wrote of Verdi: [...] "If you could see us, I seem more like a friend, rather than his pupil. We are always together at dinner, in the cafes, when we play cards...; all in all, he doesn't go anywhere without me at his side; in <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>we</b> have a big table and we both write there together, and so I always have his advice." [...] Muzio was to remain associated with Verdi, assisting {{in the preparation of}} scores and transcriptions, and later conducting many of his works in their premiere performances in the US and elsewhere outside Italy. He was chosen by Verdi as one of the executors of his will, but predeceased the composer in 1890.|$|E

Reitman and the film's art {{director}} Steve Saklad searched a number of houses in Massachusetts {{as most of the}} film is set inside the Wheelers' home. According to Reitman, [...] "We searched the entire state of Massachusetts for that house. My location manager has never looked at that many locations looking for one place. For weeks we would just drive down the street, knocking on people’s doors. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>we</b> found was perfect but it was very modern. Steve brought it back to 1987." ...|$|E

40|$|Exploring the {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>we</b> want, and <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>we</b> have, this report presents original research on <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> preferences of Australians.  A representative sample of over 700 residents in Sydney and Melbourne was asked to make real-world housing choices, limited by their budgets. <b>The</b> <b>housing</b> they chose was a much more varied mix than either city currently provides. In particular, the research suggests significant shortfalls of semi-detached housing and apartments {{in the middle and}} outer areas of both cities. The second part of the report examines recent construction trends and argues that there are barriers to delivering more of <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> people say they want. These disincentives include the cost of materials and labour for buildings over four storeys, land assembly and preparation, and the risk and uncertainty of our planning systems, especially in Victoria. A subsequent Grattan report will recommend changes to the design of <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> market in order to provide people with more of the homes they say they want.  ...|$|R

French has remarked on Saunders's messy habits when sharing the house, stating, [...] "When we lived together in Chalk Farm, {{she had a}} room at the top of <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> <b>We</b> got broken into and the police said, 'Well, it is quite bad, but the worst is that room at the top.' And, of course, nobody had been in there." [...] The two performed together after graduation, working the festival, cabaret, and stand-up circuits. They formed a double-act called The Menopause Sisters. Saunders described the act, which involved wearing tampons in their ears, as [...] "cringeworthy." [...] The manager of the club where they performed recalled, [...] "They didn't seem to give a damn. There was no star quality about them at all." ...|$|E
