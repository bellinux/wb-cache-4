5|$|During {{the initial}} {{development}} {{stages of the}} film, Pixar revisited their work from the original Toy Story and found that, although they could open the old computer files for the animated 3D models, error messages prevented them from editing the files. This necessitated recreating the models from scratch. To create the chaotic and complex junkyard scene near the film's end, more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> a half was invested {{on research and development}} to create the simulation systems required for the sequence.|$|E
5|$|Hogg had {{previously}} suffered from mental health problems. In late 1918, she fell ill, probably from severe depression. She consulted with Dr. Francis Xavier Dercum, {{a specialist in}} the treatment of nervous and mental diseases, who treated her for the next three years. She was hospitalized for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> spent a further three years convalescing, primarily in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. By the summer of 1923 Hogg was fully recovered, but she permanently discarded her dream of being a concert pianist, ostensibly because of weakness after her illness.|$|E
5|$|In August 1958, workmen digging peat {{in an area}} of Chat Moss near Worsley {{discovered}} a severed head and called the police. It was initially believed that the head had been in the bog for less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> so a search was conducted for more remains, but nothing was found. After X-rays and chemical tests, it was determined that the head had been in the bog for at least 100 years. An inquest was held into the man's death, at which the coroner returned an open verdict, and the head was put in the care of the Manchester Medical School.|$|E

The I Squadron was primarily occupied with training exercises throughout each year, and also made numerous trips to other European countries, particularly Great Britain and Sweden–Norway. In 1901, {{the ship was}} severely damaged after striking submerged rocks in the Baltic; the incident contributed to design changes in later German battleships {{to make them more}} resistant to underwater damage.|$|E

5|$|The {{conversion}} of the Archbishop of Cologne to Protestantism also triggered religious and political repercussions throughout the Holy Roman Empire.

The council continued for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> eventually moved to other cities; although several times they seemed close to negotiating a conclusion to the crisis, a successful agreement remained beyond their reach. They also offered Gebhard a sum of money to relinquish his claim, which he refused on the high moral grounds of religious principle.|$|E

5|$|Twenty radioisotopes of {{californium}} {{have been}} characterized, {{the most stable}} being californium-251 with a half-life of 898 years, californium-249 with a half-life of 351 years, californium-250 with a half-life of 13.08 years, and californium-252 with a half-life of 2.645 years. All the remaining isotopes have half-lives shorter <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> {{the majority of these}} have half-lives shorter than 20 minutes. The isotopes of californium range in mass number from 237 to 256.|$|E
5|$|For {{its first}} three months, a calf relies entirely on milk from its mother for nutrition, after which {{it begins to}} forage for {{vegetation}} and can use its trunk to collect water. At the same time, improvements in lip and leg coordination occur. Calves continue to suckle {{at the same rate}} as before until their sixth month, after which they become more independent when feeding. By nine months, mouth, trunk and foot coordination is perfected. After a year, a calf's abilities to groom, drink, and feed itself are fully developed. It still needs its mother for nutrition and protection from predators for at least another year. Suckling bouts tend to last 2–4 min/hr for a calf younger <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> it continues to suckle until it reaches three years of age or older. Suckling after two years may serve to maintain growth rate, body condition and reproductive ability.|$|E
5|$|Invisible Circles is {{the third}} studio album by Dutch symphonic metal band After Forever. It was {{released}} on 25 March 2004, by the small Dutch label Transmission Records. It is After Forever's first full-length album since the dismissal of guitarist and composer Mark Jansen, whose musical tastes had strongly influenced {{the sound of their}} first work Prison of Desire (2000) and their successful second offering Decipher (2001). In this work After Forever choose a new musical direction, mostly revolving around elements of progressive metal instead of the gothic and symphonic metal of previous albums. The creative process for Invisible Circles took more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> required the use of three recording studios in the Netherlands and Germany. A long tour to support the album brought the band {{to some of the most}} important European rock festivals and to Central and South America.|$|E

5|$|Marshall {{was elected}} to Phi Beta Kappa during his final year at college. He {{graduated}} in June 1873, receiving the top grade in fourteen of his thirty-six courses {{in a class of}} twenty-one students. As a result of his libel case, he had become increasingly interested in law and began seeking someone to teach him. At that time, the only way to become a lawyer in Indiana was to apprentice under a member of the Indiana bar association. His great-uncle Woodson Marshall began to help him, but the younger Marshall soon moved to Columbia City, Indiana, to live with his parents. Marshall read law in the Columbia City law office of Walter Olds, a future member of the Indiana Supreme Court, for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> was admitted to the Indiana bar on April 26, 1875.|$|E

Completed in December 1911, the ship was assigned to the 4th Battle Squadron of the First Fleet by 18 February 1913, but had been transferred to the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron as of 18 June.

5|$|The Provincial Assembly of Rio Grande do Sul {{was closed}} in 1837, and no {{elections}} were held {{because of the}} Ragamuffin rebellion.

5|$|Sallal's {{popularity}} among his troops declined, and after two bazooka attacks {{on his home}} by disaffected soldiers, he took Egyptian guards. He ordered the execution of his security chief, Colonel Abdel Kader Khatari, after Khatari's police fired into a mob attacking an Egyptian command post in San'a, and had refused to recognize the committee of Arab leaders appointed at Khartoum to arrange peace terms. He also fired his entire Cabinet and formed a new one, installing three army men in key ministries, and took over the army ministry and the foreign ministry for himself. Meanwhile, Nasser announced the release of three republican leaders who had been held prisoner in Egypt for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> who {{were in favor of}} peace with the royalists. The three were Qadi Abdul Rahman Iryani, Ahmed Noman and General Amri. When Sallal met with Nasser in Cairo in early November, Nasser advised him to resign and go into exile. Sallal refused and went to Baghdad, hoping to get support from other Arab Socialists. As soon as he left Cairo, Nasser sent a cable to San'a, instructing his troops there not to block an attempt at a coup.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} had {{a complicated}} organisational history during this period, {{with a large}} number of units being attached or withdrawn for short periods, while others were merged or disbanded. About thirty infantry battalions were attached for short periods and the divisional artillery and supply columns remained in support of the front line, while one ambulance company was later transferred to serve with the American 27th Division. The future of the division was again in doubt by early September; the 197th Brigade had been transferred to a training role and the division was expected to be disbanded. Bethell argued for retaining the division and was ordered to prepare it for front-line service; the 197th Brigade was replaced by the South African Brigade to bring the division back up to strength. By the end of September, following amalgamations and reorganisation, the division was left with the South African Brigade (1st, 2nd, and 4th South African Infantry regiments), the 198th Brigade (5th Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, 6th Royal Dublin Fusiliers and 6th Lancashire Fusiliers) and the 199th Brigade, with the 9th Manchester Regiment, 5th Connaught Rangers and 18th King's (Liverpool Regiment). The divisional pioneers were the 9th Gloucestershire Regiment. Less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> a half after arriving in France, the division retained only the 6th Lancashire and 9th Manchester of its twelve original battalions and both of these had been amalgamated with other units from the 42nd Division.|$|E
