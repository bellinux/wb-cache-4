40|$|This paper {{describes}} the modification {{of an existing}} gas chromatographic (GC) method to incorporate simultaneous mass spectrometric (MSD) and flame ionization detection (FID) into the analysis of tobacco humectants. Glycerol, propylene <b>glycol,</b> <b>and</b> triethylene <b>glycol</b> were analyzed in tobacco labeled as roll-your-own (RYO), cigar, cigarette, moist snuff, and hookah tobacco. Tobacco was extracted in methanol containing 1, 3 -butanediol (internal standard), filtered, and separated on a 15 m megabore DB-Wax column. Post-column flow was distributed using a microfluidic splitter between the MSD and FID for simultaneous detection. The limits of detection for the FID detector were 0. 5 μg/mL (propylene <b>glycol</b> <b>and</b> triethylene <b>glycol)</b> <b>and</b> 0. 25 μg/mL (glycerol) with a linear range of 2 - 2000 μg/mL (propylene <b>glycol</b> <b>and</b> triethylene <b>glycol)</b> <b>and</b> 1 - 4000 μg/mL (glycerol). The limits of detection for the MSD detector were 2 μg/mL (propylene <b>glycol</b> <b>and</b> triethylene <b>glycol)</b> <b>and</b> 4 μg/mL (glycerol) with a linear range of 20 - 2000 μg/mL (propylene <b>glycol</b> <b>and</b> triethylene <b>glycol)</b> <b>and</b> 40 - 4000 μg/mL (glycerol). Significant improvement in {{the sensitivity of the}} MSD can be achieved by employing selective ion monitoring (SIM) detection mode. Although a high degree of correlation was observed between the results from FID and MSD analyses, marginal chromatographic resolution between glycerol <b>and</b> triethylene <b>glycol</b> limits the applicability of FID to samples containing low levels of both of these humectants. Utilizing MSD greatly improves the reliability of quantitative results because compensation for inadequate chromatographic resolution can be accomplished with mass selectivity in detection...|$|R

The role of these compounds was investigated in shake flasks and bench-scale fermentors. 2, 3 -Butanediol was not utilized by the fungus, and 1, 2 -propanediol- 1 - 14 C was not incorporated into the alkaloids. <b>Glycols</b> <b>and</b> Tweens lowered the surface tension of the basal medium and promoted the utilization of metabolites. In the presence of <b>glycols</b> <b>and</b> Tweens, an increased uptake of labeled sorbitol and succinic acid took place, whereas the specific radioactivity of the alkaloids was not affected.

40|$|AbstractThe {{electrochemical}} behaviour {{of direct}} ethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>and</b> glycerol oxidation {{on a novel}} nickel ion implanted-modified indium tin oxide electrode (NiNPs/ITO) was investigated. The investigation is used to verify the feasibility of using the NiNPs/ITO electrode in the ethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>and</b> glycerol fuel cells. The size and morphology of nickel nanoparticles (NiNPs) on the substrate surface was determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique was utilized to characterize the typical electrochemical behaviours of the NiNPs/ITO electrode. In alkaline medium (0. 2  M NaOH), a good redox behaviour of Ni(III) /Ni(II) coupled at the surface of modified electrodes can be observed. Electrochemical performances were measured by current–time curve technology. We find that the NiNPs/ITO electrode exhibits a satisfactory electrocatalytic activity toward ethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>and</b> glycerol with good stability, making it a prime candidate for use in ethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>and</b> glycerol fuel cells...|$|R

40|$|Propylene <b>glycol</b> <b>and</b> {{triacetin}} are chemical compounds, {{commonly used}} as food additives. Though {{the usage of}} the pure chemicals is not considered harmful when used as dietary supplements, {{little is known about}} the nature of their thermal degradation products and the impact they may have on human health. For these reasons, in this manuscript we investigate the thermal decomposition mechanisms of both neutral propylene <b>glycol</b> <b>and</b> triacetin in the gas phase by a novel simulation framework. This is based on a free energy sampling methodology followed by an accurate energy refinement. Structures, Gibbs free energy barriers, and rate constants at 800 K were computed for the different steps involved in the two pyrolytic processes. The thermal decomposition mechanisms found theoretically for propylene <b>glycol</b> <b>and</b> triacetin were validated by a qualitative experimental investigation using gas-phase chromatography–mass spectroscopy, with excellent agreement.

To simultaneously determine diethylene glycol (DEG) along with ethylene glycol, methanol, isopropanol, acetone, and ethanol, we modified a previously developed gas chromatographic (GC) method. The system used a Hewlett-Packard 6890 GC with EPC, a Gooseneck splitless liner, and an Rtx- 200 capillary column (30 m x 0. 53 -ram i. d., 3 ram). After serum samples were deproteinized using ultrafiltration (MUlipore Ultrafree | 1 mL of the protein-free filtrate was manually injected into the GC. Internal standards for alcohols (<b>and</b> acetone) <b>and</b> <b>glycols</b> were n-propanol <b>and</b> 1, 3 -butanediol, respectively.

30|$|In this study, we {{describe}} a rapid HS-GC method for simultaneous quantitation of ethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>and</b> propylene <b>glycol</b> in human serum and plasma samples. Previous {{studies have reported}} GC (Balikova & Kohlicek 1988;Houze et al. 1993; Porter & Auansakul 1982; Smith 1984) methods with liquid injections for ethylene glycol. More recently, a GC-MS method has been described for ethylene glycol determination (Porter & Rutter 2010); however, many clinical laboratories {{do not have access}} to GC-MS instrumentation. The method {{we describe}} utilizes HS-GC instrumentation commonly used for measurement of ethanol, methanol, acetone, and isopropanol (‘toxic alcohols’) and allows for HS-GC for the toxic alcohols, ethylene <b>glycol,</b> <b>and</b> propylene <b>glycol.</b> The relatively high boiling points of ethylene <b>glycol</b> (197 °C) <b>and</b> propylene <b>glycol</b> (188 °C) necessitate derivatization prior to HS-GC. We utilize a simple derivitization step with phenylboronic acid prior to HS-GC, adapting from the original phenylboronic acid GC liquid injection method (Porter & Auansakul 1982). We also present a retrospective analysis into determination of ethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>and</b> propylene <b>glycol</b> in specimens at an academic medical center central clinical laboratory.|$|R
