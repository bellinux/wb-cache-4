5|$|Garfield led {{the first}} front porch {{campaign}} for the Presidency. He did not travel that much, and he usually stayed at home to present his presidential agenda to visitors. Garfield enlisted {{the support of the}} other candidates from the convention to help with the campaign. The 1880 Democratic National Convention chose Winfield Scott Hancock as <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate</b> and William Hayden English as his vice-presidential running mate. The election featured a very close popular vote that put Garfield ahead with a majority of less than 10,000; some sources put the margin as low as 2,000.

5|$|In 1994, Moscoso ran as <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate</b> of her {{deceased}} husband's Arnulfista Party (PA) in {{the general}} election, seeking to succeed PA president Guillermo Endara. Her main rivals were Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) candidate Ernesto Pérez Balladares and salsa singer Rubén Blades, who was then president of the party Papa Egoro. Moscoso and Blades sought to emphasize Pérez Balladares' connection with military ruler Manuel Noriega, broadcasting pictures of the two together, while Pérez Balladares worked to position himself as a successor to military ruler Omar Torrijos, who {{was regarded as a}} national hero. Moscoso's campaign, meanwhile, was hindered by public dissatisfaction with the perceived incompetence and corruption of Endara's government. Pérez Balladares ultimately won the election with 33% of the vote, with Moscoso receiving 29% and Blades receiving 17%.|$|E
5|$|In February 1988, plainclothes police {{officers}} forced Arias Calderón {{and his wife}} onto a plane to Costa Rica at gunpoint, and the couple spent a month in exile in Miami. Arias returned to Panama in March, calling openly for Noriega's ouster on arrival at the Omar Torrijos International Airport. In Panama's May 1989 elections, Arias stood {{as a candidate for}} First Vice President with the ADOC, with Guillermo Endara as <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate</b> and Guillermo Ford as the candidate for Second Vice President. However, Noriega's government annulled the election before voting was complete. Days after the completion of voting, Endara, Arias, and Ford were attacked on camera by Noriega supporters while security forces observed and refused to intervene. In October of that year, Arias was briefly arrested for urging citizens not to pay taxes to his government.|$|E
5|$|In giving {{attention}} to national affairs, McKinley neglected his home front in Ohio, {{and when the}} Republican state convention met in Zanesville in May 1895, {{it proved to be}} controlled by the resurgent Foraker, who sought the Senate seat to be filled by the Ohio General Assembly in January 1896. That convention endorsed McKinley for president and Foraker for Senate, and nominated Foraker supporters for state and party offices, including Asa Bushnell to succeed McKinley as governor. McKinley realized that it would be risky to have a faction hostile to <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate</b> within his home state, and sought an alliance, campaigning for Bushnell and for a Republican legislature that would send Foraker to Washington. The voters chose Bushnell and gave the state Republicans a large majority in the legislature. In January 1896, Foraker was overwhelmingly elected (to take office in March 1897), and McKinley gained Foraker's agreement to support him for president, assuring party political peace at home.|$|E

Jennings won reelection to Congress in a close race, beating Jeremiah Sullivan of Madison. In the presidential election of 1824 American political parties organized around three candidates: Andrew Jackson running against John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay. Jennings favored Adams, and later, Clay; however, when the contested presidential election passed to the House in 1825, Jennings voted with the majority and gave his political support to Jackson, but he was defeated in the House and Adams became president. Indiana voters who supported Jackson hoped for {{a victory in the}} next election.|$|E

Nixon later stated that Chotiner's promise broke the tension and gave him a needed lift.
