5|$|A {{particular}} {{thorn in}} the side of the Scottish Crown at the turn of the thirteenth century was Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness (died 1206). At some point in the last half of <b>the</b> <b>twelfth</b> century, Haraldr put aside his first wife, a daughter of an Earl of Fife, and married Hvarflǫð, a daughter of an Earl of Ross. The latter woman was a member of the powerful meic Áedha, a northern kindred who had been in open conflict with the Scottish Crown throughout <b>the</b> <b>twelfth</b> century. Previous Orcadian earls had extended influence into Ross, and it may well have been through Hvarflǫð, and the claims to the earldom that she passed to their children, that drew Haraldr into conflict with the Scots.|$|E

5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that Lǫgmaðr regained some form of control in the Isles following Magnús' death, and afterwards joined Sigurðr's expedition to Holy Land {{in the first decade}} of <b>the</b> <b>twelfth</b> century. Whether Sigurðr's undertaking was a planned crusade per se, or merely an eventful and violent pilgrimage, is debatable. The precise chronology of this enterprise is similarly uncertain, although the Norwegian fleet certainly reached England before the end of the first decade of <b>the</b> <b>twelfth</b> century. It may have been at this point, whilst Sigurðr overwintered at the English royal court, that Lǫgmaðr joined up with him. If Lǫgmaðr and Sigurðr indeed rendezvoused in England, this may have been the time when Óláfr, the future King of the Isles, was entrusted to the safekeeping of the English king.|$|E

5|$|Elementary {{education}} was widely available {{throughout most of}} the Byzantine Empire's existence, in towns and occasionally in the countryside.

5|$|From <b>the</b> <b>twelfth</b> century, burghs, {{towns that}} were granted certain legal {{privileges}} from the Crown, developed, {{particularly on the}} east coast with distinctive urban building patterns. They were typically surrounded by a palisade, and many had a castle. They usually had a market place, with a widened high street or junction, often marked by a mercat cross. There were houses for the nobles, burgesses and other significant inhabitants, which were often built in a relatively elaborate style {{and by the end of}} the period some would have slate roofs or tiles. Very little has survived of the houses of the urban poor. They were probably largely located in the backlands, away from the main street frontages. From Aberdeen and Perth there is evidence of nearly forty buildings dating from <b>the</b> <b>twelfth</b> to the fourteenth centuries, with walls of planks or wattles.|$|E

5|$|Gedi's {{participation}} in trade {{is believed to}} be the contributing factor in its founding and its later development into a city supporting an estimated population of 2,500 inhabitants at its peak. Despite the absence of historical documents specifically mentioning Gedi, it is considered to be one of the most important sites along the coast. Prior to the construction of the outer wall in the fifteenth century, the city initially developed in the northern section of the modern site. The adoption of Islam by the inhabitants in <b>the</b> <b>twelfth</b> century is marked by the presence of three superimposed mosques in the northern area the city, which were constructed during <b>the</b> <b>twelfth</b> to the fourteenth century. The style of architecture and the absence of minarets characteristic of all of Gedi's mosques has been used to suggest that the locals were influenced by the Ibadite denomination.|$|E
