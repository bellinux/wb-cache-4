40|$|Monochloracetic acid (CClH 2 -COOH) is a trimorphic substance. Only one of {{the three}} forms is stable, viz. : the α form; whereas the β and γ forms are metastable. The {{infrared}} spectrum of the forms α and β has been studied; that of the γ form has not been studied because of its extreme instability. It has been seen that the spectrum of the α form is {{different from that of the}} β form. The fundamental frequencies of monochloracetic acid have been assigned, bearing in mind the assignments made by the present authors in another paper for di- and <b>trichloracetic</b> <b>acids.</b> This assignment makes it possible to determine that the displacements which are observed when passing from form α to β chiefly affect the frequencies bound up with the carboxyl group and more especially those in the OH group. This has been confirmed by the preparation of the deuterated derivatives which likewise present themselves in α and β forms, the same relative differences in frequencies being observed. It is inferred from this study that the two crystalline forms differ in the structure of the intermolecular dimers (or polymers). The α form is the conventional dimer with two hydrogen bonds.

40|$|The {{safety of}} {{cosmetic}} procedures {{in patients who}} are pregnant and/or lactating is a complex clinical question surrounded by uncertainty. Our objective is to consolidate data on the safety of commonly requested cosmetic procedures during pregnancy and lactation after a systematic review of the current literature to guide evidence-based care in the future. A systematic search of the PubMed database was conducted for articles on cosmetic procedures during pregnancy and lactation. Due {{to a lack of}} controlled trials, case reports and series were considered. Minor procedures such as shave, punch, snipping, and electrocautery are considered safe. With respect to chemical peels, glycolic and lactic acid peels are deemed safe; however, <b>trichloracetic</b> and salicylic <b>acid</b> peels should be avoided or used with caution. Although safety data on botulinum toxin A is insufficient, the procedure may be safe because systemic absorption and placental transfer are negligible. Sclerotherapy can be safe during pregnancy but must be avoided during the first trimester and after week 36 of the pregnancy. Laser and light therapies have been considered generally safe for patients with granulomatous conditions and condylomata. Epilation should be limited to waxing, shaving, and topical treatments instead of permanent procedures. In patients who are lactating, most therapies discussed above are safe but fat transfer, sclerotherapy, and tumescent liposuction are not recommended.

40|$|A {{previously}} described colorimetric method for determination of total serum globulins {{by means of}} a tryptophan reaction is applied to the determination of total globulins isolated from serum by precipitation with 2 % <b>trichloracetic</b> <b>acid</b> in ethanol. I T HAS BEEN KNOWN for some time that some acidified-polar organic solvents, e. g., 2 % (w/v) <b>trichloracetic</b> <b>acid</b> (TCA) in ethanol, when added to serum will retain albumin in solution but precipitate all the globulins (1, 2). Several investigators have shown that albumin sepa-rated from serum in this manner is relatively free of globulins and is similar in its physical and immunologic properties to albumin obtained by low-temperature alcohol fractionation (3, 4). Recently Rodkey (5) reported a procedure for the qualltitatiVe determination of the total globulins of human serum based on the unique separative ability of 2 % TCA in ethanol.

40|$|When a {{solution}} of pepsinogen is acidified to pH 1. 0 - 5. 0, one or more reactions take place producing pepsin and certain polypeptides. It was previously noted by the writer {{that one of these}} polypeptides has a powerful inhibiting action on pepsin at pH 5. 0 6. 0 (1). The present paper describes the isolation, crystallization, and properties of this inhibitor of pepsin. The decrease in milk clotting activity at pH 5. 7 of a standard pepsin solution is used as a measure of inhibitor activity. Preparation of the inhibitor consists of activation of the pepsinogen at pH 1. 0 - 2. 0 for a very short time followed by rapid alkali inactivation of the pepsin. Precipitation of the denatured pepsin is brought about with <b>trichloracetic</b> <b>acid.</b> The inhibitor remains dissolved in the <b>trichloracetic</b> <b>acid</b> filtrate. The total nitrogen in the <b>trichloracetic</b> <b>acid</b> filtrate is about 15 per cent of the original pepsinogen nitrogen; half of this non-protein nitrogen is inhibitor nitrogen. Separation of the inhibitor from the inert polypeptides has been accomplished by repeated fractional precipitation first with tungstic acid at pH 1. 0 - 2. 0 and second by magnesium sulfate in the presence of trichloracetate ion at about pH 3. 0. When fractionation has brought the specific inhibiting activity, i. e. the inhibiting activity per milligram nitrogen [I. U. ]mg. i to above 60 per cent {{of the value of the}} pure inhibitor, the preparation may be crystallized. Half saturated ammonium sulfate, pH 5. 0, room temperature, and 3. 0 - 5. 0 mg. of inhibitor nitrogen per ml. are the conditions required for crystallization. The material first precipitates as clear spheroids which on standing form rosettes of fine needles, as may be seen in Fig. 1. Fractional recrystallization and solubility experiments indicate the presence of not more than 20 - 25 per cent impurity in the material of highest specific activity. The inhibitor is destroyed by pepsin between pH 2. 0 - 5. 0, with a rate maximum near pH 4. 0...|$|E
40|$|Papain, like trypsin, digests {{proteins}} such as hemoglobin and casein most {{rapidly in}} slightly alkaline solution. The hemoglobin method {{used to estimate}} trypsin (Anson and Mirsky (1933 - 34)) can be used without change to estimate papain, provided papain is properly activated with cyanide and there is sufficient cyanide in the hemoglobin solution. Denatured hemoglobin at pH 7. 4 is digested for 5 minutes at 25 °C. and the split products not precipitated by <b>trichloracetic</b> <b>acid</b> are estimated colorimetrically with the phenol reagent which gives a blue color with tyrosine, tryptophane, and cysteine. By this method only {{the first stage of}} digestion, due to proteinase, is measured, for hemoglobin needs to be only slightly digested for the digestion products to be not precipitable by <b>trichloracetic</b> <b>acid.</b> The digestion of hemoglobin by papain, as measured by the <b>trichloracetic</b> <b>acid</b> method, is increased by cyanide and cysteine and abolished by iodoacetate, even in the presence of cyanide. Thus the effect of iodoacetate on the digestion of protein by commercial papain, unlike the effect of iodoacetic acid on digestion by liver extract (Anson (1936 - 37)) is an effect on the proteinase. In the procedure to be described papain is activated by cyanide in strongly alkaline solution. In neutral or acid solutions, such as have hitherto been used, activation is less rapid and complete.

40|$|Background: Moisture {{control is}} very {{important}} in restorative procedures in dentistry. Use of hemostatic agents helps control moisture; however, they might result in changes on enamel and dentin surfaces, affecting composite resin bond quality. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the marginal microleakage of two different composite resins with the use of three different hemostatic agents. Material and Methods: Standardized Class V cavities were prepared on the buccal and lingual surfaces of 48 premolars with cervical margins 1 mm apical to the cementoenamel junction (CEJ). The samples were randomly divided into 8 groups. In groups 1 to 4, an etch-and-rinse adhesive (Adper Single Bond) was applied as the bonding system, followed by exposure to different hemostatic agent: group 1 : no hemostatic agent (control); group 2 : ViscoStat; group 3 : ViscoStat Clear; and group 4 : <b>trichloracetic</b> <b>acid,</b> as hemostatic agents. The cavities were restored with Z- 250 composite resin. In group 5 to 8 Silorane System Adhesive (Filtek P 90 Adhesive) was applied as a bonding agent, followed by exposure to different hemostatic agents {{in a manner similar to}} that in groups 1 to 4. The cavities were restored with Filtek P 90, a low-shrinkage composite resin. The samples in each group were evaluated for dye penetration under a stereomicroscope at × 36 after 24 hours and a 500 -round thermocycling procedure at enamel and dentin margins. Statistical analysis was carried out using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests (α= 0. 05). Results: Z- 250 composite resin exhibited significantly higher dentin microleakage scores compared to Filtek P 90 (P = 0. 004). <b>Trichloracetic</b> <b>acid</b> increased dentin microleakage with Filtek P 90 (P = 0. 033).
