500|$|During {{the second}} verse, Ross' lyrics are {{somewhat}} different, [...] "Red bottom Bawse house big as Baltimore" [...] and [...] "With a blonde bombshell trying {{to bond with}} your boy." [...] Additionally, he makes reference to strippers, as well as driving with a suspended drivers' license. Throughout the bridge, Carey sings about achieving despite surrounding odds: [...] "In spite of the chains that bind you/ You can see the mountain top/ It’s not too far." [...] Additionally, towards the last chorus, the singer releases a series of her [...] "signature" [...] high notes. During an August 2, conference call, Carey described how she felt working with the duo, and how she felt Ross' voice blended well with her own: [...] "Working with Ross and Meek on the same record was incredible. Obviously Ross is a star and everybody loves him. I'm a fan of his music," [...] said Carey on the collaboration. [...] "I really, really {{wanted to work with}} him. I love the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> I think the contrast of his voice and mine would be something special. I always like to do collaborations that people might think are different." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{protagonist of}} Dead Head Fred is Fred Neuman (voiced by John C. McGinley), a private detective. [...] Fred {{is the only}} playable character, but since each head gives him a {{different}} set of animations, he could be considered nine separate characters. [...] As he does not have a proper face, Fred's mood is portrayed by the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> and by face-like expressions formed by his eyes and frontal lobes. [...] Fred has a wisecracking, sarcastic personality and occasionally breaks the fourth wall, such as heckling the player when he dies. [...] Ulysses Pitt (Jon Polito), the game's primary antagonist, is a small-time hoodlum turned racketeer. [...] Pitt employs many henchmen throughout Hope Falls, the most prominent of which is his lieutenant Lefty, whose right leg has been amputated and replaced with a tommygun. [...] Fred makes several allies throughout the game, including Dr. Steiner, who resurrected him, his girlfriend Jeanne Rossini (Kari Wahlgren), and his former partner Benny Salazar. [...] Fred's enemies are generally employees of Pitt, like the skeletal [...] "bone thugs", or creatures created by Hope Falls' radiation, like zombies and animated scarecrows.|$|E
500|$|Sinatra's {{split with}} Gardner {{in the fall}} of 1953 had a {{profound}} impact on the types of songs he sang and his voice. He began to console himself in songs with a [...] "brooding melancholy", such as [...] "I'm a Fool to Want You", [...] "Don't Worry 'Bout Me", [...] "My One and Only Love" [...] and There Will Never Be Another You", which Riddle believed was the direct influence of Ava Gardner. Lahr comments that the new Sinatra was [...] "not the gentle boy balladeer of the forties. Fragility had gone from his voice, to be replaced by a virile adult's sense of happiness and hurt". Author Granata considered Sinatra to have been a [...] "master of the art of recording", noting that his work in the studio [...] "set him apart from other gifted vocalists". During his career he made over 1000 recordings. Recording sessions would typically last three hours, though Sinatra would always prepare for it by spending at least an hour by the piano beforehand to vocalize, followed by a short rehearsal with the orchestra to ensure the balance of sound. During his Columbia years Sinatra would use an RCA 44 microphone, which Granata describes as [...] "the 'old-fashioned' microphone which is closely associated with Sinatra's crooner image of the 1940s", though when performing on talk shows later he would use a bullet-shaped RCA 77. At Capitol he used a Neumann U47, an [...] "ultra-sensitive" [...] microphone which better captured the timbre and <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|E
60|$|An ugly thrill {{spread from}} the spot he touched. The <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> were dull and startling, and echoed strangely in Will's heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it {{a matter}} of business?" [...] said Maruja, lightly, yet with a sudden instinctive premonition of coming evil in the {{relentless}} <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you {{given up}} all hope?" [...] Fred {{asked in a}} whisper, for while {{surrounded}} by the dense blackness the full <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> sounded fearsome.|$|R
2500|$|Carmichael made {{hundreds}} of recordings between 1925 and {{his death in}} 1981. He also appeared {{on radio and television}} and in motion pictures and live performances, where he demonstrated his versatility. Because Carmichael lacked the vocal strength to sing without amplification on stage, as well as the unusual <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> which he described as [...] "flatsy through the nose, [...] " [...] he took advantage of new technologies, especially the electrical microphone, sound amplification, and advances in recording. As a singer-pianist, Carmichael was adept at selling his songs to lyricists, music publishers, film producers, and promoting them to the public via microphones on stage and in mass media.|$|E
2500|$|Sonnet 73 mainly {{focuses on}} the theme of old age and its effect on human beings. Throughout this sonnet, Shakespeare's intent is to allow his {{audience}} to observe the consequences and outcomes of old age. To properly get his point across to his readers, Shakespeare uses a variety of metaphors throughout the three quatrains to help his audience distinguish what he understands to be old age. As a result, throughout the entire sonnet the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> is in some sense negative and cold, because the thought of old age which results in death is rarely enjoyed and becomes a burden on the lives of each individual. This sonnet addresses the poet's lover, who is believed to be a man. Throughout the poem, the poet tries to explain to his lover the difficulty of old age. Shakespeare informs his audience that old age and death both share an inevitable relationship, which each individual must experience, at one point in their lifetime. He uses the metaphor of the season of fall when he refers to the [...] "yellow leaves", before he emphasizes the death of winter, which is recognized, when he begins to talk about the [...] "cold". Hence, in this sonnet, Shakespeare's use of metaphor puts an emphasis on the notion of death and old age.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Stay" [...] was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller. On February 10, 2013, whilst walking the red carpet of the 55th Grammy Awards, Rihanna held an interview with Ryan Seacrest who officially revealed that the music video would premiere on E! News the following day. Rihanna described the production saying, [...] "The video was really, really simple. I pretty much stayed put in a bathtub, and we shot it really tight, really close. There's Mikky Ekko in the video as well. This {{is the first time}} I've ever collaborated with him, so I'm excited about that because he's actually the one who wrote the song and I kinda just {{fell in love with it}} so much and in love with the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> and we wanna keep him a part of it, so you'll see him in the video." [...] The singer added, [...] "It's a very emotional song and it's personal, so you just think about, it's almost like telling a story, and when you tell a story, even to yourself — if you're saying it out loud and expressing how you feel — it needs to be powerful because it needs to be authentic." [...] On February 11, Rihanna leaked an [...] "uncut" [...] version of the video on Twitter prior to the official premiere, featuring the singer performing to the track in one singular take, without Mikky Ekko. The official version premiered on E! News later that day. It was then uploaded to Rihanna's official VEVO account at 8AM ET the following day. Shortly after the video was uploaded, it was flagged by YouTube for its sexual content. The flag has since been removed.|$|E
60|$|In {{an instant}} I was wide awake, every nerve and fibre of me, for the <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> {{told me that}} {{something}} had happened which bore upon our destinies.|$|R
60|$|As the Bravo spoke, {{he shook}} {{his hand in the}} {{direction}} of the domes of St. Mark, and the deep <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> appeared to heave up from the depths <b>of</b> <b>his</b> chest.|$|R
6000|$|While he {{was still}} at table, Toff appeared, with {{profound}} mystery in his manner, and discreet confidence in the <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] "Here's another one, sir!" [...] the Frenchman announced, in his master's ear.|$|R
60|$|Something in the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> {{brings them}} all to a standstill.|$|E
60|$|The <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> was so bitter that Stephen seized his hand.|$|E
60|$|She {{intended}} that to hurt him; {{and from}} the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> she knew it had.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the little}} things, his movement, the funny <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> that showed up big to Anna. The matter-of-fact things he said were absurd in contrast. The things her father said seemed {{meaningless}} and neutral.|$|R
5000|$|For philosopher Thomas Carlyle Coletti was [...] "by {{the cast}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face, by the <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> by <b>his</b> general bearing,(...) {{a man of}} deep and ardent sensibilities, of {{delicate}} intuitions, just sympathies originally an almost poetic soul, or man of genius." ...|$|R
60|$|He held up {{his hand}} in warning. The <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> deepened, the luster <b>of</b> <b>his</b> eyes brightened. She had stirred in the depths of that great heart the faith in which the man lived--the steady {{principle}} which guided his modest and noble life.|$|R
60|$|The <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> {{must have}} been as strange as it sounded to himself, for Barbara spun round.|$|E
60|$|The altered <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> {{which now}} had in it {{something}} of severity, {{seemed to give}} her more power.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a change}} in the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> that caused the doctor to put his hand on his wrist again.|$|E
60|$|There was tenderness, I thought, in the <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> when {{speaking}} with his wife; and I could not but look with deep interest and admiration {{on the woman}} for whom this illustrious man had {{for so many years}} cherished feelings of reverential love.|$|R
60|$|Imagine poor, simple Davidson being {{addressed}} in such terms alongside an abandoned, decaying wharf jutting out of tropical bush. He {{had never heard}} anybody speak like this before; certainly not Heyst, whose conversation was concise, polite, with a faint ring of playfulness in the cultivated <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|R
60|$|To {{this the}} ranger made vocal answer, {{and they could}} soon see him moving athwart the hillsides, zigzagging in the trailer's fashion, {{dropping}} down with incredible swiftness. He was alone, and leading his horse, but <b>his</b> celerity <b>of</b> movement and the <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> denoted confidence and health.|$|R
60|$|The <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> {{as much as}} {{the content}} of his words startled Joan so that she did not at once reply.|$|E
60|$|Although the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> {{was more}} {{disturbing}} than his question, it pleased {{one of the}} loungers to affect to take it literally.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{get into}} the sled, girls, and we'll tend to Brown and Martell," [...] {{announced}} Spouter, and the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> showed his anger.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pass on your way," [...] {{rejoined the}} figure, the harsh <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> still more exalted by passion. [...] "I want not your guidance--I want not your lodging--it is {{five years since}} my head was under a human roof, and I trust {{it was for the}} last time." ...|$|R

Caption: "There must have been times early in the 1963 - 64 Central Hockey League season when opposing goaltenders {{made the mistake of}} thinking Al Caron's shot was as pleasantly tolerable as the gentle, French-infected <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] {{interposed}} Diogenes airily, [...] "the joy {{of being}} {{of service to}} so bountiful a patron will more than compensate Frans Hals for this interruption to his work. Am I not right, old friend?" [...] he added with just a soupçon of seriousness in the mocking <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray do, Mr. Medlicot," [...] said Harry. But {{again the}} <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> was not {{sufficiently}} hearty {{to satisfy the}} man who was invited.|$|E
60|$|If {{the quiet}} <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> {{was not an}} assumed tone, he was surely ignorant of all that had passed between his {{daughter}} and myself.|$|E
60|$|It {{was evident}} from the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> that he desired his emotion to be forgotten. Something very deep in Mr. Barter {{respected}} that desire.|$|E
6000|$|Encouraged by {{the mild}} <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> and perhaps led {{on by the}} earnestness of her purpose, the female approached, until she stood at his side; when the old man {{perceived}} his visitor to be the young woman, with whom the reader, has already become acquainted {{by the name of}} [...] "Ellen Wade." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Guy, firmly, the low sweet <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> full <b>of</b> tenderness. 'You {{are very}} ill; {{but not without}} hope.' Then, after a pause, during which Philip looked thoughtful, but calm, he added,--'I have tried to bring a clergyman here, but I could not succeed. Would {{you like me to}} read to you?' ...|$|R
