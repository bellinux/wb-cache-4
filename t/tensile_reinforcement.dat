40|$|This paper {{presents}} a tensegrity {{approach to the}} minimal mass design of <b>tensile</b> <b>reinforcements</b> of masonry structures with arbitrary shapes. The proposed strengthening methodology allows {{for the design of}} minimal mass resisting mechanisms of systems formed by a network of masonry rods, mainly working in compression, and grids of <b>tensile</b> <b>reinforcements.</b> Assuming a perfectly plastic response by each member, the existence of such resisting mechanisms ensures that the reinforced structure is stable under the examined loading conditions, due to the safe theorem of the limit analysis of elastic-plastic bodies. The approach proposed in this paper includes an explicit determination of the state of prestress to be applied to <b>tensile</b> <b>reinforcements,</b> in order that they are effective under pre-existing loading conditions.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the mobilization of}} reinforcement tension within geosynthetic-reinforced soil (GRS) structures at working stress and at large soil strains. Fully-mobilized reinforcement tension is assumed in most current design methods for the internal stability of GRS structures. In these methods the mobilized <b>reinforcement</b> <b>tensile</b> load {{is assumed to be}} equal to mobilized horizontal soil forces computed using active earth pressure theory. However, comparison with reinforcement tension loads measured in the field has shown that this approach is conservative (excessively safe) by as much as a factor of two.

The results show that the ratio of <b>reinforcement</b> <b>tensile</b> load and mobilized soil shear strength is not constant Only when the average mobilized soil shear strength exceeds 95 %, is <b>reinforcement</b> <b>tensile</b> capacity mobilized significantly.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of deep beams {{is significantly}} different from shallow beams. In deep beams, the plane section does not remain plane after deformation. The main {{purpose of this study}} is to facilitate the prediction of deep beam failure related to tensile bar and web reinforcement percentage variations. Six high strength self compacting concrete (HSSCC) deep beams were tested until failure. Strains were measured on concrete surface along mid span, tensile bar and compression strut trajectory. The load was incrementally applied and at each load increment new cracks, their widths and propagation were monitored. The results clearly show that, at ultimate limit condition, the strain distribution on concrete surface along mid-span is no longer parabolic. In deep beams several neutral axes were obtained before ultimate failure is reached. As the load increases, the number of neutral axis decreases and at failure load it reduces to one. The failure of deep beams with longitudinal <b>tensile</b> steel <b>reinforcement</b> less than that suggested by ACI codes is flexural and is accompanied by large deflections without any inclined cracks. As the longitudinal <b>tensile</b> steel <b>reinforcement</b> increases, the failure due to crushing of concrete at nodal zones was clearly observed.
