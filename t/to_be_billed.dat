25|$|The AIF Sports Control Board {{was fully}} {{supported}} by the Australian Board of (Cricket) Control which appointed Major Gordon Campbell, the former South Australia wicketkeeper, as its representative in meetings about a proposed AIF team and tour. The Board of Control retained control of the team and awarded first-class status to most of its matches {{but much of the}} practical organisation, especially of fixtures, was undertaken by Surrey County Cricket Club and their representative Howard Lacey became the team manager. Lacey had organised a charity match in August 1918 between his own invitation XI and an Australian XI. The Sports Board began trials in February 1919 and there was an enthusiastic response from many servicemen with first-class or grade cricket experience. Despite {{the fact that some of}} the players still carried war injuries, the Sports Board was able to form a strong team which came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>billed</b> as the Australian Imperial Force Touring XI.|$|E

500|$|During {{the filming}} of Last Summer, a seagull was killed. [...] "In one scene," [...] Hershey explained, [...] "I had to throw the bird {{in the air to}} make her fly. We had to reshoot the scene over and over again. I could tell the bird was tired. Finally, when the scene was finished, the director, Frank Perry, told me the bird had broken her neck on the last throw." [...] Hershey felt {{responsible}} for the bird's death and changed her stage name to [...] "Seagull" [...] as a tribute to the creature. [...] "I felt her spirit enter me," [...] she later explained. [...] "It was the only moral thing to do." [...] The name change was not positively received. When she was offered a part opposite Timothy Bottoms in The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder (1974) (or Vrooder's Hooch), Hershey had to forfeit half her salary, $25,000, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>billed</b> under the name [...] "Seagull" [...] because the producers were not in favor of the billing.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, EMLL {{withdrew from the}} NWA {{and in the early}} 1990s changed its name to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). CMLL {{retained}} ownership of three NWA-branded championships which originated in the promotion. The other two were the NWA World Welterweight Championship and the NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship. All continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>billed</b> as [...] "Campeonatos de NWA". In 1994, Último Dragón bought the NWA World Middleweight Championship and its booking rights from CMLL. He chose to make himself first champion, and won it in a match with Corazón de León at a Wrestle and Romance (WAR) show on November 8, 1994, in Korakuen Hall. At that point he began promoting the title exclusively in Japan, holding it himself until vacating it in 1998. During his run with the championship Último Dragón also won the J-Crown championships, eight unified lightweight championships, but the NWA World Middleweight Championship was never integrated into the J-Crown. In 2003, after ending The Great Sasuke's long reign, Dragón signed with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and returned the championship to CMLL who he worked with off and on until that point. Averno defeated Zumbido to win the vacant title in its first CMLL match since 1994.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} notable aspects of Sabu's early career was his refusal to speak, a gimmick that he {{inherited}} from The Sheik (who never spoke English in public to protect kayfabe). In his early career, Sabu was billed as being from Saudi Arabia, or Bombay, India (in real life he is a second generation Lebanese American from Michigan). In ECW, however, he was clearly heard speaking in the ring on several occasions and it was fairly common knowledge that Brunk was an American citizen from birth. This led to a joke at kayfabe's expense when Sabu began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>billed</b> as hailing from [...] "Bombay, Michigan".|$|E

Spivey {{took part in the}} 1986 King of the Ring tournament, losing to Nikolai Volkoff in the first round. He also tried a new tag team partner. In March 1987 Spivey teamed with Tito Santana to unsuccessfully challenge the Hart Foundation for the tag team titles.

The clinic had also asked D.C. Mayor Anthony A. Williams to waive more than $40,000 in street closing and police overtime fees. [...] Both requests were granted. [...] Unnamed sources quoted by the Washington Blade, a local LGBT newspaper, said Whitman-Walker's {{financial problems}} had spilled over into Capital Pride planning.
