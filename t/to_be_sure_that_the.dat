25|$|Since copper {{availability}} in {{the body}} is hindered by an excess of iron and zinc intake, pregnant women prescribed iron supplements to treat anemia or zinc supplements to treat colds should consult physicians <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> prenatal supplements they may be taking also have nutritionally-significant amounts of copper.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} this delay in declaring postmenopause is because periods are usually erratic {{at this time of}} life. Therefore, a {{reasonably}} long stretch of time is necessary <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cycling has ceased. At this point a woman is considered infertile; however, the possibility of becoming pregnant has usually been very low (but not quite zero) {{for a number of years}} before this point is reached.|$|E
25|$|The total {{population}} of individual clones obtained in a molecular cloning experiment is often termed a DNA library. Libraries may be highly complex (as when cloning complete genomic DNA from an organism) or relatively simple (as when moving a previously cloned DNA fragment into a different plasmid), but it is almost always necessary to examine {{a number of different}} clones <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> desired DNA construct is obtained. This may be accomplished through a very wide range of experimental methods, including the use of nucleic acid hybridizations, antibody probes, polymerase chain reaction, restriction fragment analysis and/or DNA sequencing.|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to Biblical apocrypha, which series creator Chris Carter felt was appropriate to the episode's thematic concerns—hidden documents and truths not brought to light. Director Kim Manners had directed a number of stand alone [...] "monster of the week" [...] episodes, but this was his first mythology-centered episode. Manners explained that [...] "there is some individual creative contribution from the directors" [...] in stand-alone episodes, but that with mythology episodes [...] "what you need to as a director is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> performances are there ... and that the yarn is presented in its cleanest and most interesting fashion".|$|E
2500|$|Optimizing {{existing}} code {{usually does}} not add new features, and worse, it might add new bugs in previously working code (as any change might). Because manually optimized code might sometimes have less [...] "readability" [...] than unoptimized code, optimization might impact maintainability {{of it as}} well. Optimization {{comes at a price}} and it is important <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> investment is worthwhile.|$|E
2500|$|A Republican staff member, Donald Sanders, {{found out}} about the White House tapes and {{informed}} the committee on July 13, 1973. Thompson was informed of the existence of the tapes, and he, in turn, informed Nixon's attorney, J. Fred Buzhardt. [...] "Even though I had no authority to act for the committee, I decided to call Fred Buzhardt at home," [...] Thompson later wrote, [...] "I wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> White House was fully aware of what was to be disclosed so that it could take appropriate action." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{selective}} ion monitoring (SIM) certain ion fragments are {{entered into}} the instrument method and only those mass fragments are detected by the mass spectrometer. [...] The advantages of SIM are that the detection limit is lower since the instrument is only looking at {{a small number of}} fragments (e.g. three fragments) during each scan. [...] More scans can take place each second. [...] Since only a few mass fragments of interest are being monitored, matrix interferences are typically lower. [...] To additionally confirm the likelihood of a potentially positive result, it is relatively important <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ion ratios of the various mass fragments are comparable to a known reference standard.|$|E
2500|$|In such cases, {{there are}} strong policy {{considerations}} supporting the principle that a trial procedure can never be considered fair {{if a person is}} kept in ignorance of the case against him or her. First, since the grounds for a reasonable suspicion that a person is involved in terrorist activity can span from incontrovertible evidence to an innocent misinterpretation of facts which can be explained away by the person, in many cases it is impossible for courts <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> disclosure of the evidence will make no difference to the applicant. Secondly, resentment will be felt by the person and his family and friends if sanctions are imposed without any proper explanation of the grounds and when, due to the non-disclosure of information, the person is put in a position where he is unable to properly defend himself. As Lord Phillips put it, [...] "if the wider public are to have confidence in the justice system, they {{need to be able to}} see that justice is done rather than being asked to take it on trust".|$|E
2500|$|The Festiniog Railway Company had, at one point, {{planned to}} open the entire railway in 2007. Delays from Government processes, a foot-and-mouth {{epidemic}} and funding restrictions meant that the opening was repeatedly delayed, with the full opening not happening until 2011. The line could not be opened to Beddgelert until the track left the National Park at Pont Ynysferlas; this restriction was imposed by the Snowdonia National Park Authority <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> railway really meant what it said, but this suspicious attitude lost the railway a year's income from Beddgelert. From the end of May 2010, the line was extended a further [...] to [...] Shortly thereafter the railway announced that as it had approval for service by the Safety Directorate of the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR), the remaining section would be completed {{before the end of}} September 2010. The cause of this sudden rush was the ROTS to ROGS transition. This should have happened in 2006, but heritage railways gained an extension of the transition period to 1 October 2010. It was foreseen that this change in regime would bring additional costs to the railway, so it was decided to complete the line before that date. A minor delay was incurred by the necessity to build a new culvert where the new Porthmadog A487 bypass road was being built.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2011, during rehearsals for his then {{upcoming}} [...] "Future History World Tour", Derulo {{was practicing}} a stunt {{when he fell}} and broke his C2 vertebrae – leaving him in a neck brace {{for six months and}} forcing him to cancel his first headlining tour. [...] "I was not able to dance, I couldn't even really bop my head. It's the simple things that you take for granted — not being able to perform for that amount of time, and also knowing that it could be gone in an instant." [...] said Jason during an interview. [...] "I wouldn't change the accident for anything because I've grown so much from it," [...] Jason admits. Derulo then decided to channel all of this creative energy into studio time, on writing and recording his third album. He had written over 300 songs, recorded between 100 and 120 of those songs for the album and had to narrow them down to 12. A very difficult process for him as he states [...] "I wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> album was a roller coaster ride, that every single song was totally different from the last... I wanted to be sure this album was far different from that one, {{to make sure that the}} growth was present. I'm 23 now. I really wanted this album to be a direct representation of who I am. I didn't want to hide anything. This album, I wanted to tell a story.|$|E

50|$|Because taxine {{poisoning}} {{is often}} diagnosed {{after the death}} of the patient due to its rapidly effect, preventing exposure is very important.

60|$|Mr. Wadham, Junior, {{had been}} rehearsing his {{interview}} and his prospective deportment towards the Marquis {{on the way}} up, and he started the enterprise to his own entire satisfaction.
