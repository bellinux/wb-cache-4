5|$|Banished {{revolves}} around the player guiding citizens of a remote community of outcasts to grow and maintain a settlement through a command economy. The game focuses on the player's town as a whole, with {{the citizens of the}} town acting as a resource to be managed. The player must assign citizens to various jobs such as building or fishing. The citizens then perform the job without specific direction from the player. Citizens have needs that must be met in order to keep <b>them</b> <b>happy</b> and healthy, such as ensuring enough food is available or that they have a home. Additional citizens come from two sources, the birth of children and the arrival of nomads, wandering groups that wish to join the player's town. The player's citizens will age and eventually die.|$|E

Players guide and direct {{the citizens of the}} Vault, and need to keep <b>them</b> <b>happy</b> through meeting their needs such as power, food, and water. They rescue dwellers from the wasteland and assign them to different resource-generating buildings in the Vault, using the SPECIAL statistics system from the other Fallout games. Each character's SPECIAL profile affects their ability to generate different resources, and their statistics can be increased by training them in rooms devoted to each stat. The dwellers can level up over time, increasing their health, and can be given new items and weapons to help with various tasks. The number of dwellers can be increased by waiting for new dwellers from the wasteland to arrive or by pairing a male and a female dweller in living quarters to produce babies.|$|E

With all of the Toad servants influenced by the scepter, the Hammer Bros. successfully capture Mario, Luigi, and Toad, but Toad escapes and retreats to the Mushroom Kingdom. Meanwhile, Princess Peach and Toadsworth return to her castle only to discover a note from Bowser saying that he captured Mario and Luigi. Enraged, Peach leaves her castle to rescue Mario and Luigi.

25|$|At the Cowles Commission, Simon’s {{main goal}} was to link {{economic}} theory to mathematics and statistics. His main contributions were to the fields of general equilibrium and econometrics. He was greatly influenced by the marginalist debate {{that began in the}} 1930s. The popular work of the time argued that it was not apparent empirically that entrepreneurs needed to follow the marginalist principles of profit-maximization/cost-minimization in running organizations. The argument went on to note that profit-maximization was not accomplished, in part, {{because of the lack of}} complete information. In decision-making, Simon believed that agents face uncertainty about the future and costs in acquiring information in the present. These factors limit the extent to which agents may make a fully rational decision, thus they possess only “bounded rationality” and must make decisions by “satisficing,” or choosing that which might not be optimal, but which will make <b>them</b> <b>happy</b> enough. Bounded rationality is a central theme in behavioral economics. It is concerned with the ways in which the actual decision making process influences decision. Theories of bounded rationality relax one or more assumptions of standard expected utility theory.|$|E

The Snow Queen is later revealed to Elsa's aunt and one of Emma's foster mothers; she plans on making them her new sisters, despite their obvious hatred of her. The Snow Queen enacts the spell of Shattered Sight to make everyone kill each other; however, she is given a letter written by Elsa and Anna's mother that shows how much she was loved. Seeing she let herself become a monster, the Snow Queen ends the spell by killing herself. At the same time, Mr. Gold plots to free himself of the Dark One dagger's control by crushing Hook's heart in a ceremony; however, Belle uses the dagger to force Gold to leave Storybrooke. Gold reunites the Queens of Darkness (Ursula, Cruella De Vil and Maleficent) to find the Author responsible for writing their stories and force him to give <b>them</b> <b>happy</b> endings. Emma also learns that her old friend Lily is Maleficent's daughter, helping the two reunite. Allying with the Author, Mr. Gold traps everyone in a new story called Heroes and Villains, where the roles are reversed. Henry frees everyone, becoming the new Author in the process. Things get worse as the darkness in Gold escapes, being revealed to be the true Dark One. To save Regina from becoming possessed by it, Emma forces the Darkness to take her instead.|$|E
