Obviously the values in the subsample obtained by the procedure designed are lower than those obtained with the SR sample and subsample, but the differences with the latter are almost non-existent. It is therefore possible to find subsamples contained in the CSWL and in the population that have a better fit and many more observations than would be provided by a stratified random sample taken from the CSWL. Overall, the distribution of <b>total</b> <b>pensions</b> is adjusted to the population using Pearson’s goodness of fit test using a p value of 1, as in the SR sample and subsample.

5000|$|Beauregard's {{suggestion}} that judges {{should not have}} to contribute to pensions owed partly to section 92(14) of the Constitution Act, 1867, which assigned the administration of justice to the provincial governments. This suggested the federal and provincial governments would have to agree {{to the creation of a}} pension to which judges must contribute. Dickson refuted this argument by saying the general effect of the section 92(14) is limited by other more specific parts of the Constitution, in this case section 100. [...] Another interpretation of section 100 was that the type of pensions it mentioned was the kind that existed at the time of Canadian Confederation, i.e. pensions to which judges did not contribute. Moreover, the section's requirement that Parliament provides the pension could be taken as meaning Parliament alone; the section did not say judges along with Parliament had the responsibility. [...] Dickson rejected the idea that the type of pension had to be the same as it was at Confederation in 1867, because the Constitution is meant to adapt to changing circumstances. This was the living tree doctrine. [...] As for the notion that Parliament alone must pay for the pension, Dickson replied under section 100, Parliament must pay a pension, but section 100 did not say what percentage of a <b>total</b> <b>pension.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In July 2006, Historians Will Graves and C. Leon Harris {{along with}} the Southern Campaigns of the American Revolution (SCAR) decided to {{establish}} a huge research project.

Attempting to transcribe the Revolution pension statements {{from all of the}} colonies seemed unrealistic at first, however they have additionally completed transcribing pensions from Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania, and have started pensions from New Jersey and New York.

5000|$|Not until 1818, forty-two {{years after}} the end of the war, did Congress decide to grant {{pensions}} to non-disabled soldiers. Under the act of 1818, soldiers were eligible to apply for pensions if they had served in the Continental Army, the Navy, or the Marines for at least nine months, and could prove it. These pensions would be available for life. To no surprise, pension applications soared into congress following this act. Financial problems quickly arose in the government as people were clearly starting to fraud the system to get benefits. In an attempt to reduce fraud, Congress passed a remedial legislation on May 1, 1820 in which pensioners were now forced to give documentation of his estate and income to the Secretary of War, who would then decide if this person legitimately needed a pension. This dramatically reduced the pensioners by thousands, as many of them were illiterate. [...] In May 1823, Congress granted full pay pensions to surviving officers and enlisted men who eligible who served through the end of the war. Later in 1832, a service-pension act provided that every officer or enlisted man who had served at least two years in the Continental or State troops was now eligible for a full pay pension for life. These pensions could be collected by the veteran’s widow or children and did not call for the veteran to show need to receive it. On July 7, 1838, widows of enlisted men were eligible for five-year pensions if their marriage was proven to be before January 1, 1794. Congress amended this law ten years later in which they pushed the marriage date back to January 2, 1800. In 1878, there would be lifetime benefits to any widow whose husband served at least fourteen days in the Revolution. The last of the Revolutionary pensioners had died by 1867, however there were still 887 widows on the pension rolls as of 1869, ninety-three {{years after the}} British surrender in the war.The <b>total</b> <b>pension</b> cost to the federal government in 1869 was $46,178,000.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a proposal for}} a regional differentiation of Italian pensions. It is divided into five sections. The first two are introductory. In the third section, I consider pensions based upon contributions by employers and employees (Disability, Old Age and Survivorship pensions). Both the "pay as you go" and the funded schemes are considered. They are put in relationship with several demographic variables, like the old people dependency ratio, the birth rate and life expectancy. I show that, according to these factors, pensions should be higher in most southern regions, in particular Campania, and lower in many central and northern regions, in particular Liguria, Toscana and Umbria. In the fourth section, pensions paid as welfare measures are considered. I show that, with a redistributive scheme based on PPP per capita income and consumption at the regional level, pensions should be higher in the North and lower in the South. In the fifth section I show that the sum of the asbolute values of the changes estimated in the other two steps amounts to 14 b. euros, i. e. more than 7 % of <b>total</b> <b>pensions</b> ex-penditure and 1 % of GNP. italy, pension system, regional differences...|$|R

30|$|These {{considerations}} on {{the data}} from the population are important in studying the average age and average pension of the population relative to the same data in the age cohorts or strata of the CSWL and for the subsequent post-stratification. However, taking into account that the average means and the average pensions of all the population are known for each type of pension, gender and age cohort, the interest is focused on whether n_i /n≈ N_i /N, even though the CSWL size may be considered large. The first section of the paper has questioned whether the proportions in the strata or cohorts of the CSWL are similar to the corresponding ones in the population.
