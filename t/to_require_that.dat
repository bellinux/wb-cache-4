5|$|An {{order for}} review of {{detention}} directs someone holding {{a person in}} detention to produce the detainee before the High Court so that {{the legality of the}} detention can be established. The power of the Court <b>to</b> <b>require</b> <b>that</b> this be done is specifically mentioned in Article 9(2) of the Constitution of Singapore. While the other prerogative orders may only be applied for with the court's permission, an order for review of detention may be applied for without prior permission from the court.|$|E
5|$|As Representative Mark Larson {{neared the}} end of his term-limited tenure in the Colorado House of Representatives, Roberts began to work with him on {{learning}} the legislative process, in preparation for seeking elected office herself. She instigated a bill, introduced by Larson and eventually signed into law, <b>to</b> <b>require</b> <b>that</b> remains be handled in accordance with the wishes of the deceased. She also lobbied the legislature, unsuccessfully, for the creation of an interim committee to study palliative care.|$|E

5|$|The 1964 Supreme Convention was {{scheduled}} to be held at the Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans. A few days before the Convention, new Supreme Knight John W. McDevitt learned the hotel admitted only white guests, under the state's racial segregation policy. He threatened to move the Convention to another venue. The hotel changed its policy and so did the Order. The Convention amended the admissions rule <b>to</b> <b>require</b> <b>that</b> a new applicant could not be rejected by less than one-third of those voting. In 1972 the Supreme Convention amended its rules again, requiring a majority of members voting to reject a candidate.|$|E
5|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was the flight crew members' failure to use available cues and aids to identify the airplane's location on the airport surface during taxi and their failure to cross-check and verify that the airplane was on the correct runway before takeoff. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew's nonpertinent conversations during taxi, {{which resulted in a}} loss of positional awareness and the Federal Aviation Administration's failure <b>to</b> <b>require</b> <b>that</b> all runway crossings be authorized only by specific air traffic control clearances.|$|E
5|$|By 287 BC, the {{economic}} {{condition of the}} average plebeian had become poor. The problem appears to have centered around widespread indebtedness. The plebeians demanded relief, but the senators refused to address their situation. The result was the final plebeian secession. The plebeians seceded to the Janiculum hill. To end the secession, a dictator was appointed. The dictator passed a law (the Lex Hortensia), which ended the requirement that the patrician senators must agree before any bill could be considered by the Plebeian Council. This {{was not the first}} law <b>to</b> <b>require</b> <b>that</b> an act of the Plebeian Council have the full force of law. The Plebeian Council acquired this power during a modification to the original Valerian law in 449 BC. The significance of this law was in the fact that it robbed the patricians of their final weapon over the plebeians. The result was that control over the state fell, not onto the shoulders of voters, but to the new plebeian nobility.|$|E

5|$|Since the 1755 earthquake, Boston and its {{surrounding}} towns have become a major metropolitan area. Much new construction has been built on infill, especially in the Back Bay area, which may be prone to greater shaking and to compaction of the sand and gravel used as fill. Many older buildings in the Boston area are built from stone and brick, {{and are likely to}} collapse completely during a major earthquake. Given this, modern observers have expressed concern about the effects of another quake in such a major city. A 1990 study by the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency estimated potential financial losses at between $4 billion and $5 billion, and potential loss of life in the hundreds. As a consequence, the state has updated building codes and zoning laws <b>to</b> <b>require</b> <b>that</b> new construction and additions in vulnerable areas be built to resist earthquakes.|$|E
