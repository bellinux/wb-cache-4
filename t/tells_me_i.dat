Everett Koop, the 13th Surgeon General of the United States, said [...] "The ethics and morals involved in this decision are too complex for me. I believe they are too complex for you as well.

2500|$|When {{sending his}} Historical preface and {{corrections}} for the American edition in February, Darwin thanked Asa Gray for his comments, as [...] "a Review from a man, {{who is not}} an entire convert, if fair & [...] moderately favourable, is in all respects {{the best kind of}} Review. About weak points I agree. The eye to this day gives me a cold shudder, but when I think of the fine known gradations, my reason <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> ought to conquer the cold shudder." [...] In April he continued, [...] "It is curious that I remember well time when the thought of the eye made me cold all over, but I have got over this stage of the complaint, & now small trifling particulars of structure often make me very uncomfortable. The sight of a feather in a peacock's tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick!" [...] A month later Darwin emphasised that he was bewildered by the theological aspects and [...] "had no intention to write atheistically, but could not see, as plainly as others do, & as I shd wish to do, evidence of design & beneficence on all sides of us. There seems to me too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars" [...] – expressing his particular revulsion at the Ichneumonidae family of parasitic wasps that lay their eggs in the larvae and pupae of other insects so that their parasitoid young have a ready source of food. He therefore could not believe in the necessity of design, but rather than attributing the wonders of the universe to brute force was [...] "inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance. Not that this notion at all satisfies me. I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the mind of Newton" [...] – referring to Isaac Newton.|$|E
