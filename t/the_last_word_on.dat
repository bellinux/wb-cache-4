5|$|IQ classifications from IQ testing are not <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> how a test-taker {{will do in}} life, nor {{are they}} the only {{information}} {{to be considered for}} placement in school or job-training programs. There is still a dearth of information about how behavior differs between persons with differing IQ scores. For placement in school programs, for medical diagnosis, and for career advising, factors other than IQ must also be part of an individual assessment.|$|E
5|$|Groves did {{not intend}} the Smyth Report to be <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> the project. It formed an {{addendum}} to the Manhattan District History, the official history of the project. This eventually consisted of 35 volumes with 39 appendices or supplements. It {{was written in the}} immediate postwar years by the chemists, metallurgists, physicists, and administrators who had worked on the project. Since there were no security restrictions, it covered every aspect of the Manhattan Project, but was itself classified. Most of it was declassified in the 1960s and 1970s and became available to scholars, except for some technical details on the construction of the bombs.|$|E
5|$|The Origin of Birds is {{an early}} {{synopsis}} of bird evolution written in 1926 by Gerhard Heilmann, a Danish artist and amateur zoologist. The book was born {{from a series of}} articles published between 1913 and 1916 in Danish, and although republished as a book it received mainly criticism from established scientists and got little attention within Denmark. The English edition of 1926, however, became highly influential at the time due to the breadth of evidence synthesized as well as the artwork used to support its arguments. It was considered <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> the subject of bird evolution for several decades after its publication.|$|E

Costume designer Arianne Phillips commented of the Like a Virgin look: [...] "This {{was one of the most}} shocking, liberating and influential moments in pop culture/fashion history... Fashion has never been the same." [...] Madonna herself declared: [...] "I have always loved to play cat and mouse with the conventional stereotypes. My Like a Virgin album cover is a classic example. People were thinking who was I pretending to beâ€”the Virgin Mary or the whore? These were the two extreme images of women I had known vividly, and remembered from childhood, and I wanted to play with them. I wanted to see if I can merge them together, Virgin Mary and the whore as one and all. The photo was a statement of independence, if you wanna be a virgin, you are welcome. But if you wanna be a whore, it's your fucking right to be so." ...|$|E
500|$|... 18-year-old Rebbie's {{announcement}} {{that she wanted}} to marry her childhood love, Nathaniel Brown, in May 1968 created a division in the Jackson family. Jackson expressed her feelings for the man and proclaimed {{that she wanted to}} move with him to Kentucky. Katherine encouraged her daughter to proceed with the union; she felt that being a wife and mother were important roles for all of her daughters to play. Joseph, however, was against the marriage; he wanted Rebbie to {{follow in the footsteps of}} her brothers (The Jackson 5) and become a singer. Her father felt that married life would stop her from becoming a success in the entertainment business. Though Rebbie had taken clarinet, piano, and dance lessons in her childhood, she had no interest in a music career. This was despite the fact that, according to brother Jermaine, she had won several singing contests, duetting with brother Jackie. The teenager thought a happy home was more comforting and secure than the instability of show business. She also wanted to leave her family's drama-filled home on Jackson Street as well as get away from her controlling father. Arguments ensued for several weeks before her father relented and allowed Rebbie to wed Brown. Having <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> the matter, Joseph refused to walk his daughter down the aisle.|$|E
500|$|As Christmas approaches, Akeelah {{goes out}} to buy Dr. Larabee a present, but when she meets him, he reveals that he is quitting being her coach because she reminds him of his {{deceased}} daughter Denise. Instead, he gives Akeelah 5,000 flashcards to study. Without her coach, rejected by her best friend Georgia, and feeling the pressure from her neighborhood residents to make them proud, Akeelah loses her motivation. However, Tanya tells {{her that if she}} looked around her, she would realize that she has [...] "50,000 coaches". Akeelah recruits her family members, classmates, teachers, friends, and neighbor Derrick T to prepare in earnest. After reuniting with Dr. Larabee, Akeelah goes to Washington, D.C. with him, along with Tanya, Georgia, Mr. Welch, and Devon, unaware that her coach has paid for four of their tickets. Georgia rekindles her friendship with Akeelah after she invites her. During the competition, Akeelah becomes a crowd favorite. After all the other competitors are eliminated, only Dylan and Akeelah remain. The two finalists are allowed a break, during which Akeelah overhears Dylan's father harshly pressuring him to win. Akeelah attempts to intentionally lose by deliberately misspelling [...] "xanthosis". Dylan, knowing that Akeelah knows this word, intentionally misspells it as well. Dylan tells Akeelah that he wants a fair competition, rejecting his father's obsession to win. The two then proceed to spell every word listed by the judges in the hopes of winning the championship together, with Dylan earning a share of it by correctly spelling [...] "logorrhea", much to his father's delight. Akeelah spells <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> the list, [...] "pulchritude", and the two are declared co-champions amidst a cheering crowd.|$|E

2500|$|Alger was {{appointed}} Secretary of War in the Cabinet of U.S. President William McKinley on March 5, 1897. As Secretary, he recommended pay increases for military personnel serving at foreign embassies and legations. He recommended legislation to authorize a Second Assistant Secretary of War and recommended a constabulary force for Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. He {{was criticized for}} the inadequate preparation and inefficient operation of the department during the Spanishâ€“American War, especially for his appointment of William R. Shafter {{as leader of the}} Cuban expedition. [...] "Algerism" [...] became an epithet to describe the claimed incompetence of the army, especially as compared to the more stellar performance of the navy. Alger resigned at President McKinley's request, August 1, 1899, though he perhaps got <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> his critics by publishing The Spanishâ€“American War in 1901.|$|E
2500|$|Caird {{had what}} seemed to be a bewildering array of interests. Ultimately, however, it was all of a piece: the unifying thread was the variety of ways in which {{language}} works. According to N.T. Wright, he loved words, and how human beings enjoy using and abusing them. This is demonstrated, e.g., by his early attraction to Septuagintal lexicography, or his analysis of The Language and Imagery of the Bible. In the latter Caird explored, among many other concerns, the rich variety of metaphor and imagery used by the biblical writers to convey their meanings. Going against much of the modern grain, he insisted that the Old and New Testament writers must be permitted to speak with their own voices and that modern vogues, presuppositions and dogmatic biases must not be permitted to get in the way. He particularly detested recent linguistic theories such as Structuralism, which he saw as sheer lunacy; it was among the [...] "Gaderene precipitations into the Dark Ages". He [...] "believed in the perspicuity of the substance of Holy Scripture, a principle which the medieval schoolmen and the Reformation inherited from St. Augustine, but which the disciples of Rudolf Bultmann have found it notoriously hard to share". Those who read or heard him were well aware that Caird thought British biblical scholarship (that of Dodd in particular) was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> the subject, and he found nothing more satisfying than a good joust with German theology. In this regard for over thirty years Bultmann remained his favorite target.|$|E
50|$|Wet is {{an album}} {{released}} by Barbra Streisand in 1979. The album {{is a concept}} album of sorts with all the songs referring to, or expressing different interpretations of, water. Wet is also the first and <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> sung <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album.|$|R

2500|$|While Magnolia {{struggled}} {{at the box}} office, it was well-received critically. [...] it has an 84% [...] rating at Rotten Tomatoes, {{based on}} 118 [...] "fresh" [...] reviews out of 141. USA Today gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it [...] "the most imperfect of the year's best movies". In the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert praised the film, saying: [...] "Magnolia {{is the kind of}} film I instinctively respond to. Leave logic at the door. Do not expect subdued taste and restraint, but instead a kind of operatic ecstasy". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B+" [...] rating, praising Cruise's performance: [...] "It's with Cruise as Frank T.J. Mackey, a slick televangelist of penis power, that the filmmaker scores his biggest success, as the actor exorcises the uptight fastidiousness of Eyes Wide Shut ... Like John Travolta in Pulp Fiction, this cautiously packaged movie star is liberated by risky business". The Independent said that the film was [...] "limitless. And yet some things do feel incomplete, brushed-upon, tangential. Magnolia does not have <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> anything. But is superb". Kenneth Turan, in his review for the Los Angeles Times, praised Tom Cruise's performance: [...] "Mackey gives Cruise the chance to cut loose by doing amusing riffs on his charismatic superstar image. It's great fun, expertly written and performed, and all the more enjoyable because the self-parody element is unexpected". In his review for The New York Observer, Andrew Sarris wrote, [...] "In the case of Magnolia, I think Mr. Anderson has taken us to the water's edge without plunging in. I admire his ambition and his very eloquent camera movements, but if I may garble something Lenin once said one last time, 'You can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs'." ...|$|E
