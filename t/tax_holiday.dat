25|$|Under the Presidency of Carlos Flores, decrees No. 85-98 and 267-98 were {{approved}} in 1998 by the Honduras Congress {{with the aim}} of promoting the development of renewable energy-generating plants. The new legislation includes tax breaks to developers and a secure buyer arrangement for energy at prices equivalent to the system’s short-term marginal cost. ENEE, which is the default buyer, must pay a premium (10 percent of the same short-run marginal cost) for the electricity generated when the installed capacity is below 50 MW. This framework has facilitated the negotiation of about 30 public-private partnerships with ENEE for small renewable energy plants. In addition, Decree No. 85-98 also establishes tax exemptions in favor of developers: import and sales taxes on equipment, and a five-year income <b>tax</b> <b>holiday.</b>|$|E

Using a diff-in-diff methodology, we find that STHs increase overall daily spending by 8 %, with large percentage increases in spending on children's clothes and shoes of 193 % and 98 % respectively. Consumers with children increase spending more during STHs. Our estimates of price elasticities range from 6 for big box merchants to 30 for kids clothing merchants (in absolute terms). There {{is no evidence of}} inter-temporal substitution either before or after the STH or cross-product substitution away from non-treated goods.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} two empirical {{questions about}} tax incentives: (i) are incentives used as tools of tax competition and (ii) how effective are incentives in attracting investment?

Using spatial econometrics techniques for panel data to answer the first question, we find evidence for strategic interaction in <b>tax</b> <b>holidays,</b> {{in addition to the}} well-known competition over the corporate income tax (CIT) rate. We find no evidence, however, for competition over investment allowances and tax credits. Using dynamic panel data econometrics to answer the second question, we find evidence that lower CIT rates and longer <b>tax</b> <b>holidays</b> are effective in attracting FDI in Latin America and the Caribbean but not in Africa. None of the tax incentives is effective in boosting gross private fixed capital formation. Tax incentives, tax competition, investment, developing countries...|$|R
50|$|Though the {{industry}} outlook is positive on the overall, there remains {{the issue of}} forecasted threats caused by policy shifts tobe undertaken by the country. One said issue {{is that of the}} proposal ofchanges for <b>tax</b> <b>holidays,</b> the temporary reductions or eliminations of taxes. The proposal discusses the reduction of <b>tax</b> <b>holidays</b> to be implemented for the BPO industry with the compromise of having their income tax from 30% to 15%. For the next 15 years. According to Industrycharacters, the threat here is that, though tax costs would decrease the change, even if diminished to 10%, might serve as a deterrent for foreign companies to enter the Philippine market due to a reduction of the country’s competitive advantage.Other key challenges to the BPO industry are the lack of well-trained employees as well as high turnover rates, the rate at which employees are replaced, which is said to reach as high as 50% of employees in {{the industry}} during 2014.|$|R
