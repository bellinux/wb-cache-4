It was one of their deserters, in 1867, escaping down the Yukon to Bering Sea, who was the first white man to make the North-west Passage by land from the Atlantic to the Pacific. It was at this time that the first accurate description of a fair portion of the Yukon was given by Dr. W. H. Ball, of the Smithsonian Institution. But even he had never seen its source, and it was not given him to appreciate the marvel of that great natural highway.|$|R

50|$|In {{the fall}} of 1841, the brig Creole, owned by Johnson and Eperson of Richmond, Virginia, was {{transporting}} 135 slaves for sale in New Orleans, the South's major market. It had left Richmond with 103 slaves and picked up another 32 at Hampton Roads, Virginia. Most were owned by Johnson and Eperson, and 26 were owned by Thomas McCargo, a slave trader {{who was one of}} the passengers on board. While the United States had prohibited the international slave trade effective in 1808, it permitted the domestic slave trade among those states that authorized slavery; many slave <b>traders</b> <b>transported</b> captives by the coastwise slave trade along the East Coast. The brig also carried tobacco, a crew of 10, the captain's wife, daughter and niece; four passengers, including slave traders; and eight black slave servants, for a total of 160 on board.|$|R
5|$|Prior to the {{emergence}} of the ice trade of the 19th century, snow and ice had been collected and stored to use in the summer months {{in various parts of the}} world, but never on a large scale. In the Mediterranean and in South America, for example, there was a long history of collecting ice from the upper slopes of the Alps and the Andes during the summer months and <b>traders</b> <b>transporting</b> this down into the cities. Similar trading practices had grown up in Mexico during the colonial period. The Russians collected ice along the Neva River during the winter months for consumption in Saint Petersburg for many years. Wealthy Europeans began to build ice houses to store ice gathered on their local estates during the winter from the 16th century onwards; the ice was used to cool drinks or food for the wealthiest elites.|$|R
5|$|The first {{recorded}} slaves in Indiana were {{owned by the}} French traders who entered the region and introduced the practice to the native tribes. Jesuit priests encouraged the tribes they lived among to adopt slavery {{as an alternative to}} executing their prisoners in war. According to some classical historians, the decline of cannibalism among the tribes was {{a direct result of the}} rise of slavery. Early slaves were often Native Americans who were sold to pay debts. The early slaves typically performed manual labor, helping the <b>traders</b> <b>transport</b> their goods and to build forts and trading posts. While part of new France, laws were enacted to give slaves some protection from their masters. Torture and mutilation of slaves was forbidden, and families were prevented from being forcibly broken up. Other laws allowed slaves to be seized by creditors as payment. Other laws required that if a master had children by a slave, the slave and her children were then to be freed. Their status under the French laws was similar to that of minors.|$|R
30|$|Free ports {{are based}} on a form of exceptionalism which has existed since Antiquity. They have seen their role and {{function}} evolve to follow political, economic and technological developments, particularly as they relate to international trade routes. Because of these changes, some free ports disappeared while others gained and lost their importance with the ebb and flows of global trade. Globalization underlines the enduring fundamental niche that free ports play as international trade gateways, with most countries having a regulatory environment enabling free ports, with some actively promoting them. Their use remains a market strategy for actors seeking a form of arbitrage such as <b>traders,</b> <b>transport</b> and logistics companies and even financial firms. They have been effective tools of transnationalism as the examples of Shenzhen and Dubai underline. Yet, free port status does not guarantee economic development since there are numerous free ports that provided limited economic and trade impetus. The insertion of free ports within existing trade networks remains a key factor in their success, but this success is often observed afterwards.|$|R

25|$|Without {{adequate}} roads, {{the regions}} of the Dominican Republic developed in isolation from one another. In the south, the economy was dominated by cattle-ranching (particularly in the southeastern savannah) and cutting mahogany and other hard woods for export. This region retained a semi-feudal character, with little commercial agriculture, the hacienda as the dominant social unit, {{and the majority of}} the population living at a subsistence level. In the Cibao Valley, the nation's richest farmland, peasants supplemented their subsistence crops by growing tobacco for export, mainly to Germany. Tobacco required less land than cattle ranching and was mainly grown by smallholders, who relied on itinerant <b>traders</b> to <b>transport</b> their crops to Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi.|$|R
5|$|Many congregations {{gathered}} in their churches upon hearing {{news of the}} attacks, volunteering {{to spend the night}} there to protect them from further attacks. The local Catholic leaders demanded a peaceful bandh on 15 September in and around the city of Mangalore, and as a response Catholic <b>traders</b> and <b>transport</b> owners closed their shops and stopped their vehicles. A memorandum was submitted to the district council at 10.30 am, seeking protection for the lives and property of Christians. Prayers were to be held in all the 48 churches of the district on Wednesday, 17 September. On 6 October 2008, some 10,000 people from civil society and religious organisations organised a march to protest against the anti-Christian perpetrators of the attacks.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1840s, almost 300,000 {{slaves were}} transported, with Alabama and Mississippi {{receiving}} 100,000 each. During each decade between 1810 and 1860, at least 100,000 slaves were moved from their state of origin. In the final decade before the Civil War, 250,000 were moved. Michael Tadman wrote in Speculators and Slaves: Masters, Traders, and Slaves in the Old South (1989) that 60-70% of inter-regional migrations {{were the result}} of the sale of slaves. In 1820 a child in the Upper South had a 30% chance of being sold south by 1860. The death rate for the slaves on their way to their new destination across the American South was less than that suffered by captives shipped across the Atlantic Ocean, but mortality was higher than the normal death rate.Slave <b>traders</b> <b>transported</b> two-thirds of the slaves who moved west.

50|$|It {{appears that}} the {{inhabitants}} of the two sites were the Wichita descendants of the Quivira people visited by Francisco Vásquez de Coronado in 1541 in central Kansas. The reason the Quivirans moved south to these sites about 1720 is probably due to two factors. First, the Wichita were under pressure from the Apache and Comanche on the west and the Osage on the east, The Deer Creek/Bryson Paddock sites may have been more secure against attacks. Secondly, located on the Arkansas River, near the head of navigation for large canoes, French <b>traders</b> could <b>transport</b> trade goods to the sites by boat. Archaeologists have found metal tools and glass beads of French and English origin at the site. The Wichita probably traded buffalo skins and meat (jerky) to the French in exchange.

5000|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} by the archaeologists of the Mu. Rasamanikkanar historical research centre, Trichy recently on the ancient Tamil inscription found in a dilapidated temple in this area as per the article published in the Kalki Tamil Magazine. This article mentions that this temple belongs to the 13th century A.D. and the inscription is deciphered thus - This village was called Kelundagam during this period and was a trading outpost to the traders and merchants carrying goods eastwards towards Madurai (Capital of Pandyan Kingdom - Pandyan dynasty). The inscription further states {{that a group of}} eighteen merchants guild was responsible for collection of taxes from the <b>traders</b> <b>transporting</b> goods. The tax money thus collected had to be spent for the upkeep of the Lord Siva temple (Madurai Udaya Eswaran - மதுரை உதய ஈஸ்வரன்) and the Lord Vishnu temple (Thiru Kannudaya Vinnagaram - திரு கண்ணுடைய விண்ணகரம்) found in this area near the confluence of the rivers Vaigai and Manjalaru. The article has published the photographs of the old temple walls. The article mentions about a very rare sculpture in the outer temple wall that depicts the capital punishment meted out to the criminals during that age. The study mentions that these types of paintings are also found in Madurai Meenakshi temple [...] Thus, this is connected to the Pandyan Kingdom due to the name of the Lord Siva temple (Madurai Udaya Eswaran) and also the sculpture resembling Pandya architecture. The study mentions that it could not read the entire inscription as the walls are submerged underground. As this area was near the confluence of the rivers Vaigai (also called Vegavathy in this region) and Manjalaru, locals refer to this area as “Mukkuttuthurai” which means a port. From the study, this port served the local merchants to transport goods to the capital city of the Pandyan Kingdom which is Madurai. The river is called Vegavathy (fast flowing river) as it gushes downwards from the Varushanad Valley. This helps in navigation and transportation of goods through boats in the Pandyan Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|During the Soviet era, {{especially}} after World War II, {{the city was}} a regional industrial and transport center and grew to its current size. The collapse of the Soviet Union removed support for state enterprises, {{and led to the}} shutdown of most manufacturing activity in the area. Much of the city's economic activity was supported by shuttle <b>traders</b> who would <b>transport</b> (often counterfeit) goods from the bustling markets of Moscow to Yoshkar-Ola's bazaars.

50|$|Packhorse {{couriers}} in Shinano {{fell into}} three main types. The first were local peasants, hauling their goods {{and those of}} their neighbours to market.

25|$|Historians {{estimate}} {{that between the}} advent of Islam in 650CE and {{the abolition of slavery}} in the Arabian Peninsula in the mid-20th century, 10 to 18 million Black Africans (known as the Zanj) were enslaved by Arab slave <b>traders</b> and <b>transported</b> to the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries. This number far exceeded the number of slaves who were taken to the Americas. Several factors affected the visibility of descendants of this diaspora in 21st-century Arab societies: The traders shipped more female slaves than males, as there was a demand for them to serve as concubines in harems in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries. Male slaves were castrated in order to serve as harem guards. The death toll of Black African slaves from forced labor was high. The mixed-race children of female slaves and Arab owners were assimilated into the Arab owners' families under the patrilineal kinship system. As a result, few distinctive Afro-Arab communities have survived in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries.|$|R
30|$|The {{contributions}} {{of this study}} can be viewed from both academic and practical perspectives. Academically, {{the result of this}} research contributes knowledge towards TCE and the use of trade facilitation activities to enhance economic performance. The findings of this study provide a comprehensive picture on the development of TCE and the linkage with economic performance. This study examines the key attributes of trade facilitation measures and investigates the performance outcomes. This study has developed a more systemic theory-driven model for the development of TCE than those previously found in the existing literature. Furthermore, a theory that explains the development of TCEs and the performance outcomes of TECs is established and empirically tested. Practically, the result of this study has significant managerial contributions because effective trade facilitation measures have been identified, which can be useful for <b>traders</b> and <b>transport</b> related operators in selecting a location to conduct their business operations and managing their shipping operations.|$|R
