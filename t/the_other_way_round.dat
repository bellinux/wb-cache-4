40|$|Media {{have never}} been {{consistently}} free in Pakistan. Different regimes used legal and constitutional means to control the media from public debate and criticism. In it over sixty-two years of history, Pakistan has been ruled by military more than the civilian. Media in Pakistan usually face threats, violence, economic pressure, etc. The country's laws have been used against journalists. Poor literacy, urban orientation of the media, and {{the high price of}} newspapers are detrimental factors for the under development of media in Pakistan. Beside these barricades, one can now easily notice a shift from the centralized broadcasting to an open competition broadcast system in Pakistan, enabling the audience to enjoy more power of selective exposure. All governments including the military say high about the media freedom but often do <b>the</b> thing <b>other</b> <b>way</b> <b>round</b> when media criticize the government. However, during the Musharraf military and civil regime for about nine year, media were operated in a mixed character.

5000|$|Set in the 1960s, Batman: Thrillkiller {{was written}} and drawn by Howard Chaykin and Dan Brereton and {{published}} in 1997-98. It has Bruce Wayne as a detective in the Gotham Police after his family was ruined by the Great Depression. Wayne Manor has {{been taken over by}} the rebellious, and a little demented, Barbara Gordon, daughter of police Commissioner James Gordon. Her live-in boyfriend is Richart Graustark, who goes under the name of [...] "Dick Grayson", presumably to cover his German origins (World War II being still fresh in people's minds at the time). Barbara and Graustark fight crime as Batgirl and Robin, though, in true 1960s anti-establishment style, their main targets are corrupt cops, in particular those led by the Two-Face-like Detective Duell and the Joker-like but very feminine Bianca Steeplechase. In this version, Grayson's family are still circus acrobats, but their deaths are caused {{as a result of his}} activities as Robin rather than <b>the</b> traditional <b>other</b> <b>way</b> <b>round.</b> He is overcome by grief and rage over their murder and his subsequent recklessness leads to his own death. He is replaced as Barbara's partner by Detective Bruce Wayne, who takes the identity of Batman, but the memory of him drives even Barbara to the point of insanity and she adopts the Robin guise as part of seeking revenge. Within the New 52 DC Multiverse, Earth-37's 1960s seem comparable to those of Thrillkiller, although while it has a Batgirl, Robin and female Joker, it now seems to lack a Batman.|$|R

For example, if José García Torres and María Acosta Gómez had a child named Pablo, then his full name would be Pablo García Acosta. One family member's relationship to another can often be identified by the various combinations and permutations of surnames.|$|E
25|$|With every geometry, Felix Klein {{associated}} {{an underlying}} group of symmetries. The hierarchy of geometries is thus mathematically {{represented as a}} hierarchy of these groups, and hierarchy of their invariants. For example, lengths, angles and areas are preserved {{with respect to the}} Euclidean group of symmetries, while only the incidence structure and the cross-ratio are preserved under the most general projective transformations. A concept of parallelism, which is preserved in affine geometry, is not meaningful in projective geometry. Then, by abstracting the underlying groups of symmetries from the geometries, the relationships between them can be re-established at the group level. Since the group of affine geometry is a subgroup of the group of projective geometry, any notion invariant in projective geometry is a priori meaningful in affine geometry; but not <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> <b>round.</b> If you add required symmetries, you have a more powerful theory but fewer concepts and theorems (which will be deeper and more general).|$|E

25|$|Against US {{forces the}} record is more mixed. There {{were a number of}} successes {{particularly}} in ambushes, sapper attacks and various other engagements. When entrenched in strong positions, they were able to exact a price on attacking American troops, before withdrawing to cross-border sanctuaries to fight another day. VC/NVA operations however were sometimes marked by very heavy casualties. Typical of these were the Tet attacks and the border battles that saw heavy losses against superior US air, ground and naval firepower. American strategic mobility, using airpower and helicopters also took a heavy toll and blunted several communist initiatives, most notably at the Ia Drang, Tet and other places. In general during the war, US forces caused far more casualties to the VC/NVA than <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> <b>round.</b> However, the communist forces were usually able to replenish their forces. Expansion of the battle-space over a wide area, and attrition over time however, the linchpin of their protracted war strategy, kept their forces intact until this formidable opponent withdrew.|$|E
25|$|This version {{agrees with}} all other {{versions}} of the legend of Hrothgar (Roas) and Halga (Helgo) by making them sons of Healfdene (Haldan) and by presenting Hrothgar as the uncle of Hroðulf (Rolfo).

Moreover, it agrees {{with all other}} versions, except for Hrólfr Kraki's saga, by presenting Hrothgar as a king of Denmark, although it agrees with Hrólfr Kraki's saga by marrying Hrothgar to an Anglo-Saxon woman. Another agreement with Hrólfr Kraki's saga is the information that their sister was married to a Sævil Jarl, and that they had to hide on an island fleeing their kin-slaying uncle, before they could kill him and avenge their father.|$|E
25|$|According to Appian, in 60 BC Caesar {{came back}} from his {{governorship}} in Hispania (Spain and Portugal) and was awarded a triumph for his victories there. He was making preparations to celebrate this outside the city walls. He also {{wanted to be a}} candidate for the consulship for 59 BC. However, the candidates had to present themselves in the city and it was not legal for those who were preparing a triumph to enter the city and then go back out for these preparations. Since he was not ready yet, Caesar asked to be allowed to register in absentia and to have someone to act on his behalf, even though this was contrary to the law. Cato the Younger, who was against this, used up {{the last day of the}} presentation with speeches. Caesar dropped the triumph, entered the city and presented his candidacy. Pompey had failed to get the acts for his settlements he made in the east during the Third Mithridatic War ratified by the senate. Most senators opposed this because they were envious, particularly Lucius Licinius Lucullus who had been replaced in the command of this war by Pompey. Crassus had co-operated with Lucullus in this matter. An aggrieved Pompey ‘made friends with Caesar and promised under oath to support him for the consulship'. Caesar then brought Crassus into friendly relations with Pompey and ‘these three most powerful men pooled their interests.’ Appian also noted that Marcus Terentius Varro wrote a book about this alliance called Tricaranus (the three-headed monster). Appian's version and Plutarch's Life of Pompey are the only sources that have Pompey seeking an alliance with Caesar, rather than <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> <b>round.</b>|$|E

Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> <b>round.</b> However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: [...] "One day , when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision...
