5|$|Long {{took the}} lead in {{preparing}} <b>the</b> <b>explosives,</b> telling his followers that his experience as a fortuneteller, mystic and natural healer made him an expert. The bombs were made from cannon shot, carbon, sulphur and saltpeter, which were then wrapped together.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{shooting}} {{took place}} at the Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, during late 2007. Principal photography began on January 2008 in New Zealand. One of the filming locations that was selected was Dunedin. Controversy arose as the Queenstown Lakes District Council disputed the Department of Labour's decision to allow Fox to store explosives in the local ice skating rink. Fox moved some of <b>the</b> <b>explosives</b> to another area. <b>The</b> <b>explosives</b> were used for a shot of the exploding Hudson Farm, a scene which required thirteen cameras. Jackman and Palermo's Woz Productions reached an agreement with the council to allow recycling specialists on set to advise the production on being environmentally friendly. According to Hood, the screenplay was still incomplete as filming begun, with the production in Australia receiving regularly new script pages from Los Angeles, at times in the night before shooting.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{founding}} of the State of Israel, the Yishuv leadership anticipated an attack by regular Arab armies, of which Egypt's was the strongest in terms of manpower, arms and equipment. As such, Plan Dalet took stopping a potential Egyptian attack into account, and the Ad Halom (Sukrir) dual bridge over the Lakhish River was blown up as part of Operation Barak on May 12. In the eyes of the Givati command, this part of the operation was of marginal importance. A platoon from the 54th Battalion, two mules and 300 kilograms of explosives were allocated for it. The mules fled the scene, and <b>the</b> <b>explosives</b> were divided among the soldiers, who delivered them to the bridge. It took two attempts to destroy it, as some of <b>the</b> <b>explosives</b> did not work the first time.|$|E
40|$|The main {{material}} properties affecting <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> weldability {{of a certain}} metal combination are the yield strength, the ductility, the density and the sonic velocity of the two metals. Successful welding of the metal combination depends mainly on the correct choice of <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> welding parameters; i. e., the stand off distance, the weight of <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> charge relative to {{the weight of the}} flyer plate and the detonation velocity of <b>the</b> <b>explosive.</b> Based on <b>the</b> measured and the handbook values of the properties of interest, <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> welding parameters were calculated and the arrangements for <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> welding of <b>the</b> Al alloy 6061 -T 6, titanium and zirconium to OFHC copper were determined. The relatively small sheet metal thickness (1 / 8 ") {{and the fact that the}} thickness of <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> layer must exceed a certain minimum value were considered during the determination of <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> welding conditions. <b>The</b> results of the metallographic investigations and the measurements of the shear strength at the interface demonstrate the usefulness of these calculations to minimize the number of experimental trials...|$|R

50|$|Goma-2 ECO was <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> {{that was}} used in the 2004 Madrid train bombings. Terrorist Jamal Ahmidan, also known as El Chino, bought <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> {{illegally}} from a mine in northern Spain. It was also planned by the same cell that carried out the Madrid bombings to use <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> to derail a high-speed train.About 80 kilograms of <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> was used by ETA in Operation Ogro to assassinate Luis Carrero Blanco.The explosion was so powerful it threw Blanco's car over a five storey building.|$|R
5|$|The car was waved {{through three}} {{security}} checkpoints without stopping before arriving at its destination {{well within the}} base. Sixteen people {{were waiting for the}} car near a building set up to debrief al-Balawi. Al-Balawi got out of the vehicle and detonated <b>the</b> <b>explosives</b> hidden in his suicide vest.|$|E
5|$|A {{year later}} in the United States, Charlie learns that Steve has resurfaced under a new {{identity}} and is laundering the gold through a Ukrainian jeweler named Yevhen to finance his lavish lifestyle in Los Angeles. Charlie gathers the team, and also recruits John's daughter Stella, a skilled private safe cracker, offering her {{the chance to get}} revenge on Steve for her father's death. They stake out Steve's mansion, and Stella, disguising herself as a cable technician, is able to map out its interior, allowing them to determine the location of Steve's safe containing the bullion. Coincidentally, Steve, unaware of Stella's identity, offers {{to go out on a}} date with her. Charlie devises a plan using explosives to blow the safe while Stella is on the date with Steve, using three heavily modified Mini Coopers to transport the gold out of the mansion. Charlie enlists the help of Skinny Pete for <b>the</b> <b>explosives</b> and Wrench to make the modifications on the cars. However, on the night of the planned heist, they find Steve's neighbors are having a party, and <b>the</b> <b>explosives</b> would draw their attention, and they abandon the plan. Stella inadvertently gives away her identity to Steve by using similar phrases her father used, but the team arrives to help protect her. Steve is shocked they survived but taunts them that he has the upper hand.|$|E
5|$|Anderson and Dredd {{obtain the}} code to Ma-Ma's {{apartment}} from her computer expert and confront her. Ma-Ma tells Dredd that, {{in the case}} of her death, a device on her wrist will detonate explosives on the top floors, destroying the building. Dredd reasons that the detonator's signal will not reach <b>the</b> <b>explosives</b> from the ground floor, so he forces Ma-Ma to inhale Slo-Mo and throws her down the atrium to her death.|$|E

5000|$|The foil {{does not}} {{come in contact with}} <b>the</b> <b>explosive,</b> which reduces <b>the</b> risk of {{corrosion}} of the foil or chemical reactions between <b>the</b> foil and <b>explosive</b> producing unstable compounds, and secondarily further reduces the risk of accidental electrical ignition of <b>the</b> <b>explosive.</b>|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} brisant of <b>the</b> {{conventional}} <b>explosives</b> is cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (also known as RDX or Hexogen). RDX is <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> agent in <b>the</b> plastic <b>explosive</b> commonly known as C-4, constituting 91% RDX by mass.|$|R
5|$|Chlorine gas {{was also}} used during the Iraq War in Anbar Province in 2007, with insurgents packing truck bombs with mortar shells and {{chlorine}} tanks. The attacks killed two people from <b>the</b> <b>explosives</b> and sickened more than 350. Most of the deaths were caused {{by the force of}} the explosions rather than the effects of chlorine since the toxic gas is readily dispersed and diluted in the atmosphere by the blast. In some bombings, over a hundred civilians were hospitalized due to breathing difficulties. The Iraqi authorities tightened security for elemental chlorine, which is essential for providing safe drinking water to the population.|$|E
5|$|Cross perfects the Yellowjacket and hosts an {{unveiling}} {{ceremony at}} Pym Technologies' headquarters. Lang, {{along with his}} crew and a swarm of flying ants, infiltrates the building during the event, sabotages the company's servers, and plants explosives. When he attempts to steal the Yellowjacket, he, along with Pym and Hope, are captured by Cross, who intends to sell both the Yellowjacket and Ant-Man suits to Hydra. Lang breaks free and he and Hope dispatch most of the Hydra agents, though one flees with a vial of Cross' particles and Pym is shot. Lang pursues Cross, while <b>the</b> <b>explosives</b> detonate, imploding the building as Pym and van Dyne escape.|$|E
5|$|From {{his newly}} {{established}} command post, {{in the trenches}} on the eastern bank of the canal near the bridge, Howard learned that the river bridge had also been taken. Captain Neilson of the engineers reported that although the bridges had been prepared for demolition, <b>the</b> <b>explosives</b> had not been attached. Howard ordered his signalman to transmit the code words 'Ham' and 'Jam' then brought Fox's platoon across the canal bridge, positioning them at the Bénouville to Le Port crossroads as the company's forward platoon.|$|E

5|$|Germany {{was criticized}} {{severely}} {{by the international}} press for lax security measures in Frankfurt Airport that allowed Demeke to smuggle a pistol on board, and for allowing the hijacked aircraft to leave after refueling in Hannover. Frankfurt Airport, the busiest airport in Europe at the time, had recently come under fire after the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, when it had been alleged that <b>the</b> <b>explosives</b> had been loaded in Frankfurt. Since the 1988 bombing, the Frankfurt airport had performed numerous security reviews and implemented more stringent security procedures.|$|E
5|$|In March 1937, {{five months}} after the wreck, the hulk of Ohioan—still aground near Seal Rock—caught fire when a {{watchman}} aboard the ship attempted to burn some meat in a refrigerator. The flames died out before reaching <b>the</b> <b>explosives</b> that remained aboard the wreck. A Pacific storm in December the same year caused the hulk of Ohioan to break in two. By 1939, only remnants of some of Ohioans rusty steel beams were still visible on the rocks.|$|E
5|$|Operation Labrador {{was headed}} by Colonel General Slobodan Rakočević, {{head of the}} Yugoslav Air Force branch of the KOS, based in Zemun. In Zagreb, {{operational}} control of Labrador was assigned to Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Sabolović, and Major Čedo Knežević. Lieutenant Colonel Radenko Radojčić was tasked with the storage of a substantial quantity of explosives in Zagreb and its surrounding areas and the subsequent planting of explosive devices in designated locations. <b>The</b> <b>explosives</b> and other munitions were stored across several sites.|$|E
40|$|Mechanism of {{explosive}} welding is discussed. The experimental date indicate that <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> bonding interface forms behind the collision {{point and the}} physical properties of metals affect considerably this process.

40|$|AbstractLocal {{melting zone}} {{encountered}} in {{sections of the}} cladding interface is a distinguished phenomenon of <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> cladding technique. <b>The</b> thickness and morphology of the melting zone in <b>the</b> Ti/NiCr <b>explosive</b> cladding bar are investigated by means of optical microscopy. Results show that {{the distribution of the}} melting zone in the interface of <b>the</b> Ti/NiCr <b>explosive</b> cladding bar is uniform and axisymmetric, and boundaries of the melting zone are circular arcs, whose center points {{to the center of the}} NiCr bar. The bamboo-shaped cracks generate in the melting zone. The thickness of the melting zone decreases with reducing of the stand-off distance and the thickness of <b>the</b> <b>explosive.</b> A physical model of the melting zone in the interface of <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> cladding bar is proposed...|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} {{of water into}} an explosive is highly undesirable since it reduces the sensitivity, strength, and velocity of detonation of <b>the</b> <b>explosive.</b> Hygroscopicity {{is used as a}} measure of a material's moisture-absorbing tendencies. Moisture affects explosives adversely by acting as an inert material that absorbs heat when vaporized, and by acting as a solvent medium that can cause undesired chemical reactions. Sensitivity, strength, and velocity of detonation are reduced by inert materials that reduce the continuity of <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> mass. When <b>the</b> moisture content evaporates during detonation, cooling occurs, which reduces the temperature of reaction. Stability is also affected by the presence of moisture since moisture promotes decomposition of <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> and, in addition, causes corrosion of <b>the</b> <b>explosive's</b> metal container.|$|R
5|$|Prior to May 18, Kehoe had {{loaded the}} back seat of his truck with metal debris capable of {{producing}} shrapnel during an explosion. He also bought a new set of tires for his truck to avoid breaking down when transporting <b>the</b> <b>explosives.</b> He made many trips to Lansing for more explosives, {{as well as to the}} school, town, and his house. A neighbor allegedly saw Kehoe carrying objects into the school building at night numerous times but never thought to mention it to anyone.|$|E
5|$|The {{experiments}} were {{performed in the}} Bayo Canyon in a location designated TA-10 ("Technical Area 10") (but more {{commonly referred to as}} the Bayo Canyon Site) in Los Alamos County and close to the border with Santa Fe County, northeast from the Los Alamos townsite. The site had several fixed structures. The lanthanum-140 was isolated in a radiochemistry building, TA-10-1. There were four firing sites. The instruments for firing <b>the</b> <b>explosives</b> and recording the data were housed in two detonation control buildings (TA-10-13 and TA-10-15).|$|E
5|$|The {{town was}} also the centre of <b>the</b> <b>explosives</b> {{industry}} between the 17th and early 20th century, before a decline following an accident in 1916 which killed over 100 workers. This coincided with {{a revival of the}} shipping industry in the town. Faversham has a number of landmarks, with several historic churches including St Mary of Charity, Faversham Parish Church, the Maison Dieu and Faversham Recreation Ground. Faversham Market has been established for over 900 years and is still based in the town centre. There are good road and rail links, including a Southeastern service to the High Speed 1 line at Ebbsfleet International and London.|$|E

50|$|Energetic {{polymers}} (e.g. nitro or azido derivates of polymers) {{can be used}} as {{a binder}} to increase <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> power in comparison with inert binders. Energetic plasticizers can be also used. The addition of a plasticizer lowers the sensitivity of <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> and improves its processibility.|$|R
5000|$|A {{triggering}} sequence, {{also called}} an explosive train, is {{a sequence of}} events that culminates in <b>the</b> detonation of <b>explosives.</b> For safety reasons, most widely used high explosives are difficult to detonate. A primary explosive of higher sensitivity is used to trigger a uniform and predictable detonation of {{the main body of}} <b>the</b> <b>explosive.</b> Although <b>the</b> primary <b>explosive</b> itself is generally a more sensitive and expensive compound, it is only used in small quantities and in relatively safely packaged forms. By design there are low explosives and high explosives made such that <b>the</b> low <b>explosives</b> are highly sensitive (i.e. their 'Figure of Insensitivity' is low) and high explosives are comparatively insensitive. This not only affords inherent safety to <b>the</b> usage of <b>explosives</b> during handling and transport, but also necessitates an explosive triggering sequence or <b>explosive</b> train. <b>The</b> <b>explosive</b> triggering sequence or <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> train essentially consists of an 'initiator', an 'intermediary' and the 'high explosive'.|$|R
5|$|Traveling {{down the}} rows of Austrian battleships, the two men {{encountered}} Viribus Unitis at around 4:40am. Rossetti placed one canister of TNT on the hull of the battleship, timed to explode at 6:30am. He then flooded the second canister, sinking it on the harbor floor close to the ship. This second canister exploded close to the Austrian freighter Wien, resulting in her sinking. The men had no breathing sets, and therefore had to keep their heads above water. They were discovered and taken prisoner just after placing <b>the</b> <b>explosives</b> under the battleship's hull. The two-man team were captured and taken aboard Viribus Unitis, where they informed the new captain of the battleship {{what they had done}} but did not reveal the exact position of <b>the</b> <b>explosives.</b> Admiral Vuković then arranged for the two prisoners to be taken safely to the sister ship , and ordered the evacuation of the ship. The explosion did not happen at 6:30 as predicted and Vuković returned to the ship with many sailors (believing mistakenly that the Italians had lied). He therefore remained on his ship and went down with her and 300–400 of her crew when the mines exploded shortly afterwards at 6:44. Following the explosion, the battleship sank in 15 minutes.|$|E
5|$|A {{gunpowder}} plant {{had been}} established around 1573 in Faversham. The town had a stream which could be dammed at intervals to provide power for watermills. It {{became known as the}} Home Works in the 18th century and was nationalised in 1759. By the 19th century, the site stretched for around a mile along the waterfront. A second explosive works was established at Oare to the northwest of town in the late 17th century, with the Marsh Works following in 1786. Towards the end of the 19th century, two new factories were built alongside the Swale to manage production of TNT and cordite. Faversham developed six explosive factories, and from 1874 to 1919, the town was the centre of <b>the</b> <b>explosives</b> industry in the UK.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Kistiakowsky was {{the head}} of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) section {{responsible}} for the development of explosives, and the technical director of <b>the</b> <b>Explosives</b> Research Laboratory (ERL), where he oversaw the development of new explosives, including RDX and HMX. He was involved in research into the hydrodynamic theory of explosions, and the development of shaped charges. In October 1943, he was brought into the Manhattan Project as a consultant. He was soon placed in charge of X Division, which was responsible for the development of the explosive lenses necessary for an implosion-type nuclear weapon. In July 1945, he watched as the first one was detonated in the Trinity test. A few weeks later another Fat Man implosion-type weapon was dropped on Nagasaki.|$|E
