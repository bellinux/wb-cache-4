50|$|PSS {{has been}} used to create value for {{customer}} beyond selling products as functions. Typically, there are four approaches for PSS design. 1. Function-based PSS: add new functions to increase product value in the competing market. For example, GM added OnStar in 1992 to product emergency services for customers. It integrated GPS with vehicle sensory system for telematics-based on-demand services. 2. Value-added PSS: companies added new features to increase value of a product to expand its value to customers and users. Some earlier work on <b>teleservice</b> system has been done during the 1990s. For example, Otis Elevator added Remote Elevator Maintenance (REM) system to its fleet system to monitor their elevators to reduce failures. GE Healthcare (formerly GE Medical Systems) developed InSite to remotely monitor its medical equipment to reduce service costs and increase users benefits. 3. Evidence-based Service: companies use big data analytics to provide the actual saving and further develop a service contract for customer to pay for part of the saving. For example, GE Aviation Power By The Hour On-Wind Support system to reduce the fuel of aircraft engine and reduce maintenance costs through a Long-Term Service Contract (LTSC).|$|E

40|$|The German {{machine and}} plant {{construction}} industry, with its mainly small and {{medium sized enterprises}} ('Mittelstand'), is particularly strongly affected by globalisation and is exposed to high competitive pressure. The stagnation of markets in Europe makes it essential for firms to open up new markets in distant regions, particularly in Asia, and to concentrate on keeping their regular customers. Appropriate use of the newest {{information and communication technologies}} can help to attain these goals. At the same time, the increasing complexity of machines and plants, as well as the growing proportion of software for machine control, require new and specialised knowledge, so that the customers of mechanical engineering have to rely more on support from the manufacturer's experts. The aim is to bridge distances between customer and manufacturer effectively and at reasonable cost. <b>Teleservice</b> (TS) is one answer to this problem. The findings are that <b>Teleservice</b> offers innovative potentials - which have been insufficiently exploited so far - for bringing machines into service, remote diagnosis and fault elimination, and for extended use in process support and customer advisory services. All enterprises that are already using <b>Teleservice</b> today are gaining economic and strategic advantages from this and are planning a further expansion of its use. At present <b>Teleservice</b> is particularly worthwhile for complex new machines whose modern controls are already planned to accommodate <b>Teleservice.</b> Theleservice is internationally considered as a strategically important technology application whose potential usefulness can only be realised in the relatively long term. Germany has a clear lead with regard to the range of services and technical level of existing solutions. The telecommunication infrastructure is no longer regarded as a problem. The survey comes to the conclusion that <b>Teleservice</b> should be used as an important component of business strategy in the area of service and customer relations. (orig.)

40|$|An INFORMATION ON DEMAND (IOD) <b>Teleservice</b> {{developed}} at the German National Research Center for Information Technology (GMD) provides remote access to multimedia information consisting of audio, video, and text. It uses a bidirectional narrowband message link between the end user and the service provider, and a unidirectional broadband data link from the service provider to the end user. Hyperstructure of the multimedia database, clear information presentation (on SUN workstations and on PCs) and high speed communication with long round-trip-delays were the major problems to be solved.
