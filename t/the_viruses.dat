5|$|In this falling block puzzle game, the player's {{objective}} is to destroy <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> populating the on-screen playing field by using colored capsules that are tossed into the field by Mario, who assumes {{the role of a}} doctor. The player manipulates each capsule as it falls, with the goal being to align similar colors which removes <b>the</b> <b>viruses.</b> The player progresses through the game by eliminating all <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> on the screen in each level.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} of Dr. Mario and <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> appeared in print media numerous times: Valiant published {{a volume of}} Nintendo Comics Systems entitled The Doctor Is In... Over His Head, Dr. Mario also makes a brief appearance in {{the first volume of}} Super Mario-Kun, and <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> also appear at the end of Super Mario Adventures.|$|E
5|$|Rotaviruses are {{stable in}} the {{environment}} and {{have been found in}} estuary samples at levels up to 1–5 infectious particles per US gallon, <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> survive between 9 and 19 days. Sanitary measures adequate for eliminating bacteria and parasites seem to be ineffective in control of rotavirus, as the incidence of rotavirus infection in countries with high and low health standards is similar.|$|E
50|$|Lastly, <b>the</b> <b>Virus</b> {{has always}} been 16 parts multitimbral for {{multilayered}} patches and ensemble performances. However, up until <b>the</b> <b>Virus</b> TI, this aspect of <b>the</b> <b>Virus</b> has been severely flawed and is often considered unusable because of the polyphonic limitations of <b>the</b> <b>Virus</b> A, B and C.|$|R
5000|$|... 9. Now {{get rid of}} <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> executable. Type 'explorer' on {{the command}} line. This will start Windows File Explorer. Navigate to the hard drive {{location}} of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> as noted in #7 above. Select <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> by clicking ONCE on the file (not TWICE! Double-clicking on <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> will start it up!). Right-click and select 'Delete' or hit your 'Delete' key on the keyboard and delete <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> program.|$|R
50|$|In {{an effort}} to {{restrict}} <b>the</b> <b>virus,</b> <b>the</b> United States, Great Britain and other countries prohibit the commercial sale of broken bulbs, or bulbs known to be infected by <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> As TBV-infected bulbs gradually degenerate, <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> can be minimized by removing and destroying 'broken' bulbs quickly before aphids spread <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> to other bulbs or cross-contaminating lily hosts.|$|R
5|$|Some viruses {{can cause}} lifelong or chronic infections, where <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> {{continue}} to replicate {{in the body}} despite the host's defence mechanisms. This is common in hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infections. People chronically infected are known as carriers, as they serve as reservoirs of infectious virus. In populations with {{a high proportion of}} carriers, the disease is said to be endemic.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics have {{no effect}} against viral infections or against <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> that cause the common cold. Due to their side effects, {{antibiotics}} cause overall harm but are still frequently prescribed. Some {{of the reasons that}} antibiotics are so commonly prescribed include people's expectations for them, physicians' desire to help, and the difficulty in excluding complications that may be amenable to antibiotics. There are no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold even though some preliminary research has shown benefits.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Mario {{offers a}} {{multiplayer}} gaming mode {{in which two}} players compete {{against each other in}} separate playing fields. In this mode, the player's goal is to clear their own playing field of viruses before the other player does. Eliminating multiple viruses or initiating chain reactions can cause additional capsules to fall onto the opponent's playing field. A player wins a single game upon eliminating all <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> or if the other playing field fills up. The first player to win three games wins overall.|$|E
5000|$|Persistent infection: There is a {{delicate}} balance between the host and <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> in this pattern. <b>The</b> <b>virus</b> adjusts its replication and pathogenecitiy levels to keep the host alive for its own benefit. While {{it is possible for}} <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> to live and replicate inside the host for its entire lifetime, oftentimes the host eventually eliminates <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b>|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> was {{isolated}} from the A. americanum nymph, it was inoculated into many test animals including: newborn and full-grown mice, woodchucks, raccoons, as well as chicken and duck eggs. <b>The</b> <b>virus</b> was most pathogenic to the newborn mice, causing death in many of them. In the full grown mice, their reaction to <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> was determined by how <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> was inoculated in them. Mice who received <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> intraperitoneally, showed no reaction or symptoms to <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> However about seventy-five percent of mice who were inoculated in their cerebrum showed sickness or even death, due to <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> One out of the six woodchucks studied showed signs of being infected while the others had no response to the inoculation. Only raccoons developed antibodies against <b>the</b> <b>virus,</b> and did not show any other signs of being exposed. The chicken and duck eggs were not affected in any way.|$|R
50|$|Transmission of RHD occurs {{by direct}} contact with an {{infected}} animal and fomites. Rabbits acquire RHD through oral, nasal or conjunctival pathways. Urine, faeces and respiratory secretions may also shed <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> <b>The</b> <b>virus</b> may also be carried by the wind. Carriers of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> may remain infectious {{for up to a}} month depending on climate conditions; however, <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> has been known to persist for as little as 2 days and as long as 215 days. An infected carcass or hairs from an infected animal may also transmit RHD. Fomites such as clothing, contaminated food, cages, bedding, feeders and water will also harbour <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> Even though <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> cannot reproduce in other mammals, predators and scavengers such as foxes, ferrets and some birds can excrete <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> through their faeces after ingesting an infected rabbit carcass. Flies, rabbit fleas, and mosquitoes can also spread <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> between rabbits.|$|R
5|$|Some viruses {{can cause}} lifelong or chronic infections where <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> {{continue}} to reproduce {{in the body}} despite the host's defence mechanisms. This is common in hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infections. People chronically infected with a virus are known as carriers. They serve as important reservoirs of the virus. If {{there is a high}} proportion of carriers in a given population, a disease is said to be endemic.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses {{replicate}} within archaea: {{these are}} double-stranded DNA viruses with unusual and sometimes unique shapes. These viruses {{have been studied}} in most detail in the thermophilic archaea, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Defences against these viruses involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences within archaean genomes {{that are related to}} the genes of <b>the</b> <b>viruses.</b> Most archaea have CRISPR–Cas systems as an adaptive defence against viruses. These enable archaea to retain sections of viral DNA, which are then used to target and eliminate subsequent infections by the virus using a process similar to RNA interference.|$|E
5|$|Viruses are {{the most}} {{abundant}} biological entity in aquatic environments—there are about one million {{of them in a}} teaspoon of seawater—and they are essential to the regulation of saltwater and freshwater ecosystems. Most of these viruses are bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals. They infect and destroy the bacteria in aquatic microbial communities and {{this is the most important}} mechanism of recycling carbon in the marine environment. The organic molecules released from the bacterial cells by <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth.|$|E

25|$|In {{a natural}} setting, the {{respiratory}} infection of Sendai virus in mice is acute. From the extrapolation of the infection of laboratory mice, {{the presence of}} <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> may first be detected in the lungs 48 to 72 hours following exposure. As <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> replicates in <b>the</b> respiratory tract of an infected mouse, the concentration of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> grows most quickly during {{the third day of}} infection. After that, the growth of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> is slower but consistent. Typically, the peak concentration of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> is on <b>the</b> sixth or seventh day, and rapid decline follows that by the ninth day. A fairly vigorous immune response mounted against <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> is <b>the</b> cause of this decline. The longest period of detected presence of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> in a mouse lung is fourteen days after infection.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>virus</b> is {{probably}} distributed worldwide (wherever asparagus is grown commercially). <b>The</b> <b>virus</b> spreads in East Asia, Eurasia, and North America. <b>The</b> <b>virus</b> occurs in Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.|$|R
5|$|A second defence of {{vertebrates}} against viruses {{is called}} cell-mediated immunity and involves immune cells known as T cells. The body's cells constantly display short fragments of their proteins on the cell's surface, and, if a T cell recognises a suspicious viral fragment there, the host cell is destroyed by killer T cells and the virus-specific T-cells proliferate. Cells {{such as the}} macrophage are specialists at this antigen presentation. The production of interferon is an important host defence mechanism. This is a hormone produced by the body when viruses are present. Its role in immunity is complex; it eventually stops <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> from reproducing by killing the infected cell and its close neighbours.|$|E
5|$|About 10,000years ago {{the humans}} who {{inhabited}} the lands around the Mediterranean basin began to domesticate wild animals. Pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, camels, {{cats and dogs}} were all kept and bred in captivity. These animals would have brought their viruses with them. The transmission of viruses from animals to humans can occur, but such zoonotic infections are rare and subsequent human-to-human transmission of animal viruses is even rarer, although there are notable exceptions such as influenza. Most viruses are species-specific and would have posed no threat to humans. The rare epidemics of viral diseases originating in animals would have been short-lived because <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> were not fully adapted to humans and the human populations were too small to maintain the chains of infection.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2007 article, the mite Varroa {{destructor}} {{remains the}} world's most destructive honey bee killer, {{due in part}} to <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> it carries, including deformed wing virus and acute bee paralysis virus, which have both been implicated in CCD. Affliction with Varroa mites also tends to weaken the immune system of the bees. Dr. Enesto Guzman, an entomological researcher at the University of Guelph in Canada, studied 413 Ontario bee colonies in 2007–08. The presence of Varroa mites within colonies before winter was observed to weaken the immune systems of bees and introduce viruses that led to colony death during the winter. About 27% of hives did not survive the winter, and the Varroa mite was identified as the cause in 85% of the cases. Varroa mites also affect the queen's ability to reproduce, which is detrimental to the survival of the hive. As such, Varroa mites have been considered as a possible cause of CCD, though not all dying colonies contain these mites.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was unedrtaken in order to clarify {{interaction}} between <b>virus</b> and <b>the</b> host cells in which <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> is growing actively, using rabbit kidney tissues cultured in vitro according to Maitland's method and the testicular strain of vaccinia virus. This paper deals with experiments what experimental condition of Maitland's method is suitable for multiplying <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> and what hsitological and histochemical change occurrs in the tissues cultured by the infection of <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> <b>The</b> following results were obtained. 1. As for the influences of components of the culture media upon the multiplication of <b>the</b> <b>virus,</b> addition of {{a small amount of}} rabitt serum was observed to accerelate the multiplication of <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> Moreover, among <b>the</b> three saline solutions tested, Hanks' solution was most suitable to employ for the. purpose of cultivating <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> in vitro. 2. The tissues thus cultured according to Maitland's method in vitro degenerated with the time of incubation period and no difference was observed in the histological and histochemical preparates between the tissues cultured with <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> and without <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> <b>The</b> <b>virus</b> multiplied in <b>the</b> tissues ten times as much as in the inoculating material three days after incubation...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>virus</b> enters <b>the</b> {{nucleus of}} {{infected}} cells, and reproduces until the cell is assimilated by <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> and produces crystals in the fluids of the host. These crystals will transfer <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> from one host to another.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> titers varied among mice {{infected}} with <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> <b>The</b> <b>virus</b> titers in <b>the</b> trachea of Hdac 6 transgenic mice {{at the age}} of 11  weeks were significantly reduced compared to control (P <  0.05) (Fig.  2 F).|$|R
5|$|Archaea can be {{infected}} by double-stranded DNA viruses that are unrelated {{to any other}} form of virus and have a variety of unusual shapes, including bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops. These viruses have been studied in most detail in thermophilics, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Two groups of single-stranded DNA viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated. One group is exemplified by the Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 ("Pleolipoviridae") infecting halophilic archaea and the other one by the Aeropyrum coil-shaped virus ("Spiraviridae") infecting a hyperthermophilic (optimal growth at 90–95°C) host. Notably, the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssDNA genome. Defenses against these viruses may involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences that are related to the genes of <b>the</b> <b>viruses.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Mya Breitbart, Forest Rohwer, {{and colleagues}} used {{environmental}} shotgun sequencing (see below) {{to show that}} 200 liters of seawater contains over 5000 different viruses. Subsequent studies showed {{that there are more}} than a thousand viral species in human stool and possibly a million different viruses per kilogram of marine sediment, including many bacteriophages. Essentially all of <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> in these studies were new species. In 2004, Gene Tyson, Jill Banfield, and colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley and the Joint Genome Institute sequenced DNA extracted from an acid mine drainage system. This effort resulted in the complete, or nearly complete, genomes for a handful of bacteria and archaea that had previously resisted attempts to culture them.|$|E
5|$|Like most arboviruses, dengue {{virus is}} {{maintained}} in nature in cycles that involve preferred blood-sucking vectors and vertebrate hosts. <b>The</b> <b>viruses</b> are maintained {{in the forests}} of Southeast Asia and Africa by transmission from female Aedes mosquitoes—of species other than A. aegypti—to their offspring and to lower primates. In towns and cities, the virus is primarily transmitted by the highly domesticated A. aegypti. In rural settings the virus is transmitted to humans by A. aegypti and other species of Aedes such as A. albopictus. Both these species had expanding ranges {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. In all settings the infected lower primates or humans greatly increase the number of circulating dengue viruses, in a process called amplification.|$|E
50|$|Once the {{transformation}} is complete, a Pak Protector must periodically consume more Tree-of-Life root to maintain <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> in its body. Without <b>the</b> <b>virus,</b> a Protector will weaken and die as its DNA is degraded; <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> supplies replacement DNA.|$|R
50|$|Tromantadine {{inhibits}} {{the early}} and late events in <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> replication cycle. It changes the glycoproteins of the host cells, therefore impeding the absorption of <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> It inhibits penetration of <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> It also prevents uncoating of the virions.|$|R
50|$|Nematodes of {{the family}} Trichodoridae, the stubby-root {{nematode}}s, are vectors of <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> <b>The</b> nematode species Paratrichodorus minor, for example, introduces <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> when it feeds on the roots of plants. <b>The</b> <b>virus</b> can also be spread on garden tools. It can also be mechanically and seed transmitted.|$|R
5|$|The {{common cold}} virus is {{typically}} transmitted via airborne droplets (aerosols), {{direct contact with}} infected nasal secretions, or fomites (contaminated objects). Which of these routes is of primary importance has not been determined; however, hand-to-hand and hand-to-surface-to-hand contact seems of more importance than transmission via aerosols. <b>The</b> <b>viruses</b> may survive for prolonged periods in the environment (over 18 hours for rhinoviruses) and can {{be picked up by}} people's hands and subsequently carried to their eyes or nose where infection occurs. Transmission is common in daycare and at school due to the proximity of many children with little immunity and frequently poor hygiene. These infections are then brought home to other members of the family. There is no evidence that recirculated air during commercial flight is a method of transmission. People sitting in close proximity appear to be at greater risk of infection.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{symptoms}} of a cold include a cough, a runny nose, nasal congestion and a sore throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. A sore throat is present in about 40% of cases and a cough in about 50%, while muscle ache occurs in about half. In adults, a fever is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, {{a great deal of}} similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-1 more {{commonly}} causes infections around the mouth while HSV-2 more commonly causes genital infections. They are transmitted by direct contact with body fluids or lesions of an infected individual. Transmission may still occur when symptoms are not present. Genital herpes is classified as a sexually transmitted infection. It may be spread to an infant during childbirth. After infection, <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> are transported along sensory nerves to the nerve cell bodies, where they reside lifelong. Causes of recurrence may include: decreased immune function, stress, and sunlight exposure. Oral and genital herpes is usually diagnosed based on the presenting symptoms. The diagnosis may be confirmed by viral culture or detecting herpes DNA in fluid from blisters. Testing the blood for antibodies against the virus can confirm a previous infection but will be negative in new infections.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>virus</b> {{responsible}} for <b>the</b> {{disease is a}} picornavirus, the prototypic member of the genus Aphthovirus. [...] Infection occurs when <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> particle is taken into a cell of the host. The cell is then forced to manufacture thousands of copies of <b>the</b> <b>virus,</b> and eventually bursts, releasing the new particles in <b>the</b> blood. <b>The</b> <b>virus</b> is genetically highly variable, which limits the effectiveness of vaccination.|$|R
2500|$|Survivors of {{the disease}} can become lifelong {{carriers}} of <b>the</b> <b>virus,</b> contaminating water with urine, sperm, and ovarian fluids. <b>The</b> <b>virus</b> {{has been shown to}} survive two freeze/thaw cycles in a conventional freezer, suggesting both live and frozen bait could be a transmission vector. In Europe, the gray heron has spread <b>the</b> <b>virus,</b> but it does so mechanically; <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> is apparently inactive in the ...|$|R
30|$|The {{principle}} of controlling <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> infection is either eradicating <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> or keeping <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> concentration {{at a low}} level while the ‘good’ cells at a high level. Since some classes of virus replicate so rapidly and irregularly that it is hardly possible to eradicate, the strategy of controlling <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> infection {{is to find a}} certain dynamical balance which does not lead to a disaster.|$|R
