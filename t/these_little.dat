5|$|While seated {{upon the}} bare rocks I have often {{observed}} <b>these</b> <b>little</b> animals watching me, apparently {{with as much}} curiosity as I watched them, turning their heads {{from side to side}} as if in an effort to be wise. If I kept quiet for a few minutes they would creep up to me and finally upon me; if I moved, they ran down the faces of the rocks, and turning, stuck their heads above the edges to watch me.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} Jurassic, Europe was a dry, {{tropical}} archipelago {{at the edge}} of the Tethys Sea. The fine limestone in which the skeletons of Compsognathus have been found originated in calcite from the shells of marine organisms. Both the German and French areas where Compsognathus specimens have been preserved were lagoons situated between the beaches and coral reefs of the Jurassic European islands in the Tethys Sea. Contemporaries of Compsognathus longipes include the early avialan Archaeopteryx lithographica and the pterosaurs Rhamphorhynchus muensteri and Pterodactylus antiquus. The same sediments in which Compsognathus have been preserved also contain fossils of a number of marine animals such as fish, crustaceans, echinoderms and marine mollusks, confirming the coastal habitat of this theropod. No other dinosaur has been found in association with Compsognathus, indicating that <b>these</b> <b>little</b> dinosaurs might in fact have been the top land predator in these islands.|$|E

5|$|The beak of the kakapo {{is adapted}} for {{grinding}} food finely. For this reason, the kakapo {{has a very}} small gizzard compared to other birds of their size. It is generally herbivorous, eating native plants, seeds, fruits, pollen and even the sapwood of trees. A study in 1984 identified 25 plant species as kakapo food. It is particularly fond of {{the fruit of the}} rimu tree, and will feed on it exclusively during seasons when it is abundant. The kakapo has a distinctive habit of grabbing a leaf or frond with a foot and stripping the nutritious parts of the plant out with its beak, leaving a ball of indigestible fibre. <b>These</b> <b>little</b> clumps of plant fibres are a distinctive sign of the presence of the bird. The kakapo is believed to employ bacteria in the fore-gut to ferment and help digest plant matter.|$|E

25|$|With the {{subdivision}} of the Amato territory, many residents became minor landowners. However many {{were unable to}} survive from <b>these</b> <b>little</b> farms and soon they sold their possessions to other landowners thus contributing to the consolidation of large territories under the ownership of few families, a fact that remains to this day. While recent divisions among heirs has divided the large holdings, the lands remain, nonetheless, within the same families noted above.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the shift}} key, {{typewriters}} {{had to have}} a separate key and typebar for upper-case letters; in essence, the typewriter had two keyboards, one above the other. With the shift key, manufacturing costs (and therefore purchase price) were greatly reduced, and typist operation was simplified; both factors contributed greatly to mass adoption of the technology. Certain models, such as the Barlet, had a double shift so that each key performed three functions. <b>These</b> <b>little</b> three-row machines were portable and could be used by journalists.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{his works}} also contain letters and words added to the painting. He explains: The words in the {{paintings}} are sometimes important to make you start thinking about what {{else is going on}} in there. And a lot of times, the words excite me as shapes, and something'll grow out of that. I used to cut <b>these</b> <b>little</b> letters out and glue them on. They just look good all lined up like teeth... sometimes they become the title of the painting.|$|E
25|$|The {{size and}} shape of a large cotton reel, <b>these</b> <b>little</b> sweet, spiced mutton pies are a golden brown, crispy pastry with a moist, sweet inside. They can be eaten as an hors d'oeuvre, with a salad or as a dessert. They are cooked in {{patisseries}} all over the town, but their origin is far from local. Tradition has it that Lord Clive brought the recipe from India and taught it to the pastry makers of Pézenas when he was staying at the Château de Larzac in 1768. It is more likely is that his servants were responsible.|$|E

25|$|Anyway, I keep picturing all <b>these</b> <b>little</b> {{kids playing}} some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around – nobody big, I mean – except me. And I'm {{standing}} {{on the edge of}} some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff – I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.|$|E
25|$|Privation {{had made}} a man of him, and in <b>these</b> <b>little</b> books he proves himself a poet of deep feeling and {{considerable}} power of expression. The stirring incidents in the political emancipation of Portugal inspired his muse, and he describes the bitterness of exile, the adventurous expedition to Terceira, the heroic defence of Porto, and the final combats of liberty. In 1837 he founded the Panorama in imitation of the English Penny Magazine, and there and in Illustração he published the historical tales which were afterwards collected into Lendas e Narrativas; {{in the same year}} he became royal librarian at the Ajuda Palace, which enabled him to continue his studies of the past. The Panorama had a large circulation and influence, and Herculano's biographical sketches of great men and his articles of literary and historical criticism did much to educate the middle class by acquainting them with the story of their nation, and with the progress of knowledge and the state of letters in foreign countries.|$|E
500|$|One day, bassist Mike Dirnt was in {{the studio}} {{recording}} a 30-second song by himself. Armstrong decided {{that he wanted to}} do the same, and drummer Tré Cool followed suit. Armstrong recalled, [...] "It started getting more serious as we tried to outdo one another. We kept connecting <b>these</b> <b>little</b> half-minute bits until we had something." [...] This musical suite became [...] "Homecoming", and the group subsequently wrote another suite, [...] "Jesus of Suburbia".|$|E

500|$|Despite the lukewarm {{reception}} at its première, the Sept haï-kaïs were performed in concert several times with growing success. [...] In April 1929, {{the organizers of}} the 7th festival of the International Society for Contemporary Music presented the work in Geneva, performed by Madeleine Grey and conducted by Ernest Ansermet. [...] Following the concert, Aloys Mooser praised the Sept haï-kaïs as [...] "chiselled with a subtle, refined artistry. [...] In a few lines, <b>these</b> <b>little</b> pieces create a singularly expressive atmosphere".|$|E
500|$|... "It {{was a hard}} decision, {{and this}} was not {{remotely}} {{having to do with}} us wanting to upgrade the acting ability or jump the character in age. The twins who play the part (Jaden and Ella Hiller) were not happy. We started feeling like we were just being mean to <b>these</b> <b>little</b> girls, making them come to the stage. And the character is reaching an age where she would talk, and {{that was going to be}} an asset to us to have Cam and Mitch communicating with her." ...|$|E
500|$|Watkins {{remembers the}} first time they saw the group: [...] "I saw Mark Fox. And then I saw <b>these</b> <b>little</b> girls {{skipping}} and running around. And they looked about thirteen. This can't be them. No way!". Nevertheless, the Spice Girls managed to impress them. They played a few of their tracks, but neither Watkins nor Wilson particularly like them, except for a song the group wrote with Richard Stannard and Matt Rowe, called [...] "Feed Your Love", which the duo thought was [...] "dark and cool". A songwriting session was booked within the next days.|$|E
