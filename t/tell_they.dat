25|$|Giger {{conceived}} the Alien as being vaguely human but a human in full armor, protected from all outside forces. He mandated that the creature have no eyes, {{because he felt}} that it made them much more frightening if you could not <b>tell</b> <b>they</b> were looking at you. Giger also gave the Alien's mouth a second inner set of pharyngeal jaws located {{at the tip of}} a long, tongue-like proboscis which could extend rapidly for use as a weapon. His design for the creature was heavily influenced by an aesthetic he had created and termed biomechanical, a fusion of the organic and the mechanic. His mock-up of the Alien was created using parts from an old Rolls Royce car, rib bones and the vertebrae from a snake, molded with plasticine. The Alien's animatronic head, which contained 900 moving parts, was designed and constructed by special effects designer Carlo Rambaldi. Giger and Rambaldi together would win the 1980 Academy Award for Visual Effects for their design of the Alien.|$|E

Tony and Jacqui decide to adopt a child, however due to Jacqui's criminal record the social services <b>tell</b> <b>they</b> won't be able to adopt.

Julie is sent away by Tony after she attempts to make amends.

500|$|In an {{interview}} after the episode aired, Sapochnik detailed {{the process of}} filming the battle and called Akira Kurosawa's Ran an inspiration in shooting the scenes: [...] "I watched every pitch field battle I could find (footage of real ones too), looking for patterns — for what works, what doesn't, what takes {{you out of the}} moment, what keeps you locked in. Interestingly one of the things I noticed is that staging of these battles through the years has changed dramatically. Back in the day you'd see these huge aerial shots of horse charges and there were two big differences. First, it was all real — no CGI or digital replication. And second, often when the horses would go down, you can kind of <b>tell</b> <b>they</b> got really hurt. Nowadays you'd never get away with that, and nor would you want to." ...|$|E

In 2005, Michael Shermer expressed concern over confirmation bias and experimenter bias in the tests, and concluded that Sheldrake's claim was unfalsifiable.|$|E
2500|$|The {{thousands}} of Halloween postcards produced between {{the start of}} the 20th century and the 1920s commonly show children but do not depict trick-or-treating. The editor of a collection of over 3,000 vintage Halloween postcards writes, [...] "There are cards which mention the custom [...] or show children in costumes at the doors, but {{as far as we can}} <b>tell</b> <b>they</b> were printed later than the 1920s and more than likely even the 1930s. Tricksters of various sorts are shown on the early postcards, but not the means of appeasing them".|$|E

I could <b>tell</b> you why <b>they</b> cannot; but I will not take up your time. But if they cannot explain it, {{there are those who}} can. St. Paul explains it in the Epistle. The Lord Jesus Himself explains it in the Gospel. <b>They</b> <b>tell</b> us why money will not make a gentleman. <b>They</b> <b>tell</b> us why poverty will not unmake one: but <b>they</b> <b>tell</b> us more. <b>They</b> <b>tell</b> us the one only thing which makes a true gentleman. And <b>they</b> <b>tell</b> us more still. <b>They</b> <b>tell</b> us how every one of us, down to the poorest and most ignorant man and woman in this church, may become true gentlemen and ladies, in the sight of God and of all reasonable men; and that, not only in this life, but after death, for ever, and ever, and ever.

2500|$|The comic, set after Iron Man {{but before}} Iron Man 2 and The Incredible Hulk, was {{conceived}} {{to explain the}} post-credits scenes of Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, where Tony Stark meets Nick Fury {{for the first time}} but General Ross not for the first time, respectively. Arbona said that [...] "when Tony Stark spoke to General Ross at the end of The Incredible Hulk, you could <b>tell</b> <b>they</b> already knew each other; they spoke about some shared history they'd had together. Well in Iron Man 2: Public Identity you see when they first meet, and what that shared history is." [...] This comic explains that the AI J.A.R.V.I.S. was created in memory of Edwin Jarvis, introduced here as Howard Stark's butler. A younger version of the character appears in Agent Carter, portrayed by James D'Arcy.|$|E
2500|$|Invalid Channel said, [...] "Bajo and Hex are hilarious to watch, {{they have}} so many funny moments. You can <b>tell</b> <b>they</b> know their shit, too, they've been around the block {{when it comes to}} games and they use {{terminology}} without it sounding super lame and out of place. At the same time, they make it easy for non-gamers, or people who wish they were gamers (ie: me) to understand. Bits and pieces feel really awkward though, and I know they put in awkward moments for comedic effect sometimes, but I find that these don't always have the comedic effect that they're probably going for, and end up going full circle just being plain awkward". It argues the [...] "small size and down-to-earth-ness" [...] of the show adds to its charm, by saying [...] "a commercial version of the show would be way too polished and just wouldn't feel right". It ended its review by saying [...] "all in all, Good Game is a good show [...] the reviews are quite good". While it thought there was room for improvement, it said [...] "the show's got it's [...] niche and it should stick to it".|$|E
2500|$|Though Westbrook {{initially}} enjoyed {{her time}} {{back at the}} soap, {{she was unable to}} keep her working life and private life separate. Off-screen, her partying and drug-use (both in and out of work) began to affect her performance. Her cast mates attempted to curtail the problem. Actors such as Wendy Richard and Mike Reid requested that Westbrook's dressing room be situated near theirs and away from the younger cast, because they could see she was [...] "vulnerable". They attempted {{to talk to her about}} her drug problem, but Westbrook ignored their concerns and continued using. She has revealed that she became so affected by cocaine that she would continuously mess up her lines, had to do take after take, was constantly late and needed prompts, and spontaneously fell asleep, once even passing out while she stood at the top of the Queen Vic stairs during filming, and was only saved from harming herself by Ross Kemp who caught her in his arms. She has commented, [...] "When I watch re-runs of those scenes now I can't believe how out of it I look." [...] Many of the newer, younger cast members began to shun her, laughing at her and throwing peanuts at her during filming every time she attempted to deliver her lines. Eventually, the producers tired of Westbrook. She has revealed: [...] "the producers now had serious doubts about my future on the soap. I was proving to be a liability. My behaviour was interfering with the schedule. It was interfering with other cast members' work. There were days when I just didn't bother showing up for work at all. The dilemma they faced was what to do with me. They had only just written [...] back into the soap; now, within months, they were having to write her out of it all over again. They felt bad about getting rid of me, too. I could <b>tell</b> <b>they</b> felt responsible for me but of course ultimately there wasn't much they could do to help [...] Within a couple of weeks I was called into a meeting and told very politely that they were going to let me go early and terminate my contract. They would, they explained, gradually write my character out of the scripts again, which would take a couple of months to do." ...|$|E
