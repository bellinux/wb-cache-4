5|$|In The Disasters of War, Goya {{does not}} excuse any purpose to the random slaughter—the plates are devoid of the {{consolation}} of divine order or the dispensation of human justice. This {{in part a}} result of the absence of melodrama or consciously artful presentation that would distance the viewer from the brutality of the subjects, as found in Baroque martyrdom. In addition, Goya refuses to offer the stability of traditional narrative. Instead, his composition tends to highlight <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>disturbing</b> aspects of each work.|$|E

Forty random 400 m 2 plots were allocated in each fragment to survey plant population structures, number of stumps, cattle feces, burnt logs, and canopy openness. Soil cover by life forms was estimated in 1 m 2 sub-plots. Lianas were abundant in intermediately logged fragments and invasive herbs in <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>disturbed</b> fragment. Cattle avoided dense herbaceous strata, such as liana tangles. Cavanillesia arborea, Eugenia dysenterica and Swartzia multijuga trees occurred at very low densities in all the fragments and their seedlings were practically absent, which might endanger their future populations in these fragments. Myracrodruon urundeuva, Tabebuia impetiginosa and Astronium fraxinifolium, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> logged species, had high density of seedlings in all the fragments.

25|$|One such {{therapy is}} trauma-focused therapy. This therapy {{involves}} bringing <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>disturbing</b> {{elements of a}} traumatic memory to mind and using therapist-guided cognitive restructuring {{to change the way}} the memories are thought about. The change in evaluation usually involves highlighting that the feelings of certain death, extreme danger, hopelessness and helplessness within a traumatic memory do not apply to the person now, as they survived the event. The therapy also focuses on extending the memory so it is recalled beyond the most traumatic parts. Extending them to a point where the person felt safe again, so they remember the event in a more complete way with less focus on the negative aspects. As an example, a traumatic memory of wartime combat might be extended to after a battle, to when the person was no longer in immediate danger. In processing the memory in these ways it becomes less likely to intrude into their thoughts as an unwanted flashback.|$|E

40|$|The storm time {{evolution}} of equatorially mirroring H+ ions {{in the inner}} magnetosphere has been statistically examined by {{using data from the}} Polar satellite. We focused on two energy ranges of H+ observed by Polar; 31 – 80 keV and 125 – 173 keV, which are referred to as low- and high-energy components, respectively. The following two phases were defined; the developing phase (pre-storm time to near <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>disturbed</b> time) and <b>the</b> declining phase (near <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>disturbed</b> time to post-storm time), which is 3 days before (after) the equatorial crossing of Polar during the storm time. We obtained the following results: (1) Low-energy H+ tends to increase during the developing, and to decrease during the declining at all magnetic local times (MLTs) except for the pre-noon sector. (2) The low-energy H+ is anti-correlated with the magnetic field, probably indicating that the low-energy H+ reduces the equatorial magnetic field due to a diamagnetic effect. (3) High-energy H+ tends to increase on the dayside during the declining phase. (4) The high-energy H+ is poorly correlated with the magnetic field. High-energy H+ behaves significantly different from the low-energy H+, and that some process other than betatron acceleration, diffusion and substorm-associated injection could have been responsible for the variation of the high-energy H+...|$|R

Altogether, 15 bryophyte species and 74 lichen species were found. Releves were classified using cluster analysis. In well-preserved forests, communities dominated by bryophytes and close to the climax associations Antitrichietum californicae and Leptodontetum smithii are present, together with elements of the Lobarion pulmonariae. Lichen communities of the Xanthorion parietinae (Physcietum adscendentis, Parmelietum acetabulae and Ramalinetum fastigiatae) are dominant in <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>disturbed</b> conditions, rarely accompanied by elements of the Leucodontetum schiroides. In closed coppice and young woodland a community dominated by Neckera complanata, Metzgeria furcata, Frullania dilatata, Phlyctis argena and Physconia venusta is present, probably close to the Antitrichietum curtipendulae. In mature forests of Q. pubescens and open coppices of Q. ilex, a similar community is also present, though richer in lichen species, and with Frullania dilatata as the only dominant livewort.

Keza MacDonald, in her review at IGN, shared these frustrations, finding that tackling player-constructed houses made the game over-reliant on trial and error. She also {{found it hard to}} empathize with the small, pixelated characters, leading her to believe that the game failed in [...] "communicating much of a message". Nick Capozzoli of GameSpot also gave the game a largely negative review, criticising the nihilistic feel, and saying that it did not bring out the emotions it was aimed to.|$|E

The Hara-Kiri moves were added to allow the losers to perform a finishing move as well, creating a race between both players. The Death Traps, meant to be introduced in the previous game, were added to give the combat more strategy as well as to give more chances to players to win a fight if they are at a disadvantage.
