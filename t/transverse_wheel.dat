40|$|Two {{models for}} {{simulation}} of dynamic interaction between train and turnout are developed. The {{first one is}} derived using a commercial software for dynamics of multi-body systems. The second {{is based on a}} detailed model of track dynamics and a multi-body dynamics formulation that accounts for excitation in an extended frequency range (up to several hundred Hz). Using a finite element model of a standard turnout design, a complex-valued modal superposition of track dynamics is applied to account for the structural receptance of the track components. The variations in rail profile, track stiffness and track inertia along the turnout, and contact between the back of the wheel flange and the check rail, are considered. Hertzian theory and FASTSIM are used for the normal and tangential wheel–rail rolling contact. Stochastic analysis methods are integrated with the dynamic simulation model. For one given nominal layout of the turnout, the influence of several parameters on wear and rolling contact fatigue is investigated. Four parameters (axle load, wheel–rail friction coefficient, and wheel and rail profiles) are identified to be the most significant. Random distributions of the <b>transverse</b> <b>wheel</b> profile and of a set of transverse rail profiles along the switch panel are accounted for by use of the Karhunen–Loève expansion technique. To determine input data for the turnout model (rail pad stiffness, ballast stiffness and modal damping), impact load testing for measurement of track receptance was performed in the field. Lateral and vertical wheel–rail contact forces were measured by an instrumented wheelset to validate the mathematical models. Good agreement between measured and calculated contact forces is observed. The influence of train speed, moving direction and route on the measured wheel–rail contact forces is quantified...|$|E

50|$|G-bodies {{were some}} of the last cars to follow the classic front engine big V8/rear wheel drive muscle car formula, {{remaining}} popular while most mid-sized cars moved to front wheel drive, modest V8s, and V6s. They were also among the last truly production-based vehicles raced in NASCAR (and quite competitively at that, with the Buick Regal in particular dominating many races in its time). NASCAR regulations continued to stipulate production body parts until 2003 (namely, the hood, roof, and deck lid), but since most of the vehicles that bodies were derived from during this period had <b>transverse</b> front <b>wheel</b> drive (many even lacking a V8 as an option), the drivetrain and all running gear were either custom or sourced from other (usually, older) models.|$|R
50|$|On {{cars and}} trucks, several senses {{of the word}} axle occur in casual usage, {{referring}} to the shaft itself, its housing, or simply any <b>transverse</b> pair of <b>wheels.</b> Strictly speaking, a shaft which rotates with the wheel, being either bolted or splined in fixed relation to it, is called an axle or axle shaft. However, in looser usage, an entire assembly including the surrounding axle housing (typically a casting) is also called an axle.|$|R
5000|$|An even broader (somewhat figurative) {{sense of}} the word refers to every pair of {{parallel}} wheels on opposite sides of a vehicle, regardless of their mechanical connection {{to each other and to}} the vehicle frame or body. Thus, <b>transverse</b> pairs of <b>wheels</b> in an independent suspension may be called an axle in some contexts. This very loose definition of [...] "axle" [...] is often used in assessing toll roads or vehicle taxes, and is taken as a rough proxy for the overall weight-bearing capacity of a vehicle, and its potential for causing wear or damage to roadway surfaces.|$|R
5000|$|The first Minica (LA20) {{was first}} {{introduced}} in October 1962 as a two-door sedan based on the Mitsubishi 360 light truck, sharing its front-mounted ME21 359 cc twin-cylinder air-cooled engine driving the rear <b>wheels,</b> <b>transverse</b> leaf springs in front and beam axle/leaf springs at the rear. Top speed was marginally higher at 86 km/h. With its tailfins and scalloped rear windshield, the Minica looked even more anachronistic than its van/pickup counterparts. In November 1964 the Minica (and 360) received a fairly thorough facelift and the improved ME24 engine (LA21).

5000|$|The engines, {{initially}} four [...] Salmson Z9 water-cooled radials were wing {{mounted in}} tractor-pusher pairs driving four-blade propellers. The water-cooled engine, with its radiator behind the propeller allowed neat, tight and well streamlined cowlings, mounted above the lower wing {{on a series}} of short struts. Each pair had two struts connecting the lower cowling to the upper fuselage and another strut ran from the upper cowling outwards to the upper wing. The main undercarriage was a divided axle type, each single bungee sprung main wheel carried on two legs immediately below the engine, with a pair of struts inboard to the lower fuselage. Just forward of this wide track undercarriage ran a streamlined <b>transverse</b> skid, from <b>wheel</b> to wheel, mounted on the lower wing.|$|R

40|$|Design {{concepts}} for {{an improved}} automotive gas turbine powertrain are discussed. Twenty percent fuel economy improvement (over 1976), competitive costs (initial and life cycle), high reliability/life, low emissions, and noise/safety compliance {{were among the}} factors considered. The powertrain selected consists of a two shaft gas turbine engine with variable geometry aerodynamic components and a single disk rotating regenerator. The regenerator disk, gasifier turbine rotor, and several hot section flowpath parts are ceramic. The powertrain utilizes a conventional automatic transmission. The closest competitor was a single shaft turbine engine matched to a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Both candidate powertrain systems {{were found to be}} similar in many respects; however, the CVT represented a significant increase in development cost, technical risk, and production start-up costs over the conventional automatic transmission.

5000|$|The Citroën Prototype Y {{to replace}} the 2CV based Citroën Ami that dated back to 1960 in the early seventies, was {{originally}} developed in co-operation with Fiat, built on the lessons from the Citroën G-mini and EN101 projects. It used the then new and advanced Fiat 127 platform, that used a <b>transverse</b> front <b>wheel</b> drive engine, with an end on gearbox layout that Fiat had pioneered in the 1960s. When cooperation with Fiat ended, a new Citroën designed platform was planned. After the takeover of Citroën by Peugeot {{in the wake of}} the 1974 oil crisis, the renamed [...] "Projet VD (Voiture Diminuée)" [...] became the Citroën Visa, incorporating the floor pan of the Peugeot 104, to use the advanced 104 engine, with transmission (under the engine) and chassis. It was the first new model under the platform-sharing policy of PSA Peugeot Citroën that continues today. The earlier Citroën LN was just a facelift of the Peugeot 104Z [...] "Shortcut" [...] with a re-engine and transmission from the Citroën Dyane. Eventually, in 1984, the original Citroën platform design from [...] "Project Y" [...] emerged as an Oltcit in Romania, using a Citroën Visa flat-twin engine and Citroën GS based gearbox, and Citroën GS flat-four engine and gearbox, and was also sold in Western Europe as the Citroën Axel to recoup money that Citroën had invested in Romania, that the communist government couldn't repay. This project was problematic for Citroën due to build quality issues, only 60,184 Axels were made, even though the base models were priced below the 2CV in Western Europe. The Axel was never sold in the UK.|$|R
40|$|Glass fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (GFRP) {{bridge deck}} systems offer an attractive alternative to concrete decks, particularly for bridge rehabilitation projects. Current design practice treats GFRP deck systems {{in a manner}} similar to concrete decks. The results of this study, however, indicate that this may result in non-conservative design values for the bridge girders. Results from a number of in situ load tests of three steel girder bridges having the same (GFRP) deck system are used to determine the degree of composite action that may be developed and the <b>transverse</b> distribution of <b>wheel</b> loads that may be assumed for such structures. Results indicate that appropriately conservative design values may be found by assuming no composite action between GFRP deck and steel girder and using the lever rule to determine transverse load distribution. When used to replace an existing concrete deck, the lighter GFRP deck will result in lower total loads applied to the bridge structure, although, due to the decreased effective width and increased distribution factors, local flange stresses and particularly the live load-induced stress range is likely to be increased. Thus, existing fatigue-prone details may become a concern and require attention in design...|$|R
40|$|Initiation and {{propagation}} of fatigue cracks under heavy traffic loading {{is one of}} the most frequent causes of damage for road steel bridges. A particular case where fatigue phenomena have often been observed is the orthotropic steel deck (OSD). Due to its intricate layout with plated structural components in different planes and the inherent vulnerability of the employed welded connections to fatigue, bridges with this type of deck require accurate fatigue verifications. In the process of fatigue assessment an important part of uncertainty is the fatigue loading, commonly expressed in the form of stress variation at each detail. This stress-time history is typically related to certain bands of amplitude of stress cycles and their corresponding number. Thus, acquisition of relevant information for these aspects becomes important. Since, as representative as possible fatigue assessment is sought, strain measurements are utilised, so that bridge-specific load characteristics can be obtained. It is therefore examined to which extent relevant fatigue load information can be obtained through these monitoring in OSDs. It is further of interest to which extent, based on the identified load attributes, the stress histories at other details can be simulated. For practical investigation of the foregoing a case study is used, where strain measurements at specific locations of an OSD have been conducted. An approach is formulated based on bridge weigh-in-motion (B-WIM); a technique to weigh vehicles as they pass above a bridge. The main principle of B-WIM is the comparison of the measured response with a corresponding theoretical one, based, in this case, on a FE model. The peculiarities of the OSD result in various parameters that can affect the stresses and should be allowed for in the modelled response. The employed approach is structured in such a way so that the influence of these parameters can be examined. Application of the approach results into identification of <b>transverse</b> position and <b>wheel</b> loads. Then, simulated stress derivation at strain gauge locations based on identified characteristics and certain assumptions is realised. Comparison of these stresses with the corresponding measured ones gives an insight on the accuracy of the whole task. Unfortunately, acquired information on loads, <b>transverse</b> positions, <b>wheel</b> types etc. cannot be directly verified due to absence of reference values. Inspection of the comparisons between modelled and measured stresses shows a relatively good agreement in the overall shape, which implies close approximation of the wheel load-transverse position combination. In the vicinity of the sensors located under the deck plate, however, the effect of additional parameters like the wheel footprint increases. A number of factors thus act in a combined way affecting the stress ranges and leading, locally, to higher discrepancies. The discussed influence is further verified by a sensitivity analysis. Generally, it can be concluded that information such <b>wheel</b> loads, approximate <b>transverse</b> position of the wheel and wheel type (single or double) can be obtained through appropriate processing of the measured strain signal. Further, verifications need to be made, including comparisons with reference values so that an insight into the accuracy can be obtained. For further derivation of accurate stresses at deck plate details based on identified attributes, greater attention must be paid to the expected wheelprint (depending on the wheel load) as well as the correct inclusion of the possible stress reduction effect caused by the asphalt wearing surface.

50|$|An econobox is a United States pejorative slang {{term for}} any {{of a series of}} small, boxy, {{fuel-efficient}} economy cars with few luxuries and a low sticker price. Econobox mostly denotes a stripped out, poverty specification, built down to a price, entry level version of a conventional car of the era, such as the 1950s Studebaker Scotsman or 1970s/80s Chevrolet Chevette. The other school of economy car design is to re-invent the car in order cope better with the stringent design constraints of low cost while retaining functionality. The British Austin Mini which did not sell well in America is the archetypal car of this school, and was bought by many British and other Europeans who could afford much more expensive cars, because it was at launch in 1959 technologically advanced with <b>transverse</b> engine front <b>wheel</b> drive and all independent suspension, and was stylish, fashionable and fun to drive as well as economical.The typical modern econobox is a subcompact car, usually with a three-door hatchback format with transverse engine mounting and front-wheel drive, to maximize interior space despite overall small dimensions.

As an error function, the paper offers a deviation measure of calculating and experimental grinding forces averaged for a single-pass of the grinding wheel. As {{an example of}} cutting forces model coefficients calculation for linear model, in which the grinding forces depend on uncut chip thickness is analyzed. The coefficients vary on abrasive grain geometric parameters and are determined applying the authors-developed method based on Nelder-Mead technique.

Model coefficients are identified if compare the measured data with the results of modeling for grinding by tool with the uniformly distributed abrasive grains with the triangular shape of cutting edge. Grinding dynamics simulation applying the determined coefficients was carried out for the processing of cantilever plane work-piece as a test example.

40|$|The load {{distribution}} factor concept allows the design engineer {{to consider the}} longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> effects of <b>wheel</b> loads as two separate phenomena and thus simplifying the analysis and design of the bridge. North American codes of practice do not provide the design engineer with sufficient guidance regarding elastic {{load distribution}} factors for skew composite bridges. These codes of practice also require a check {{to be made on}} the strength of the sections of the bridge at the ultimate limit state, but they specify the use of elastic load distribution factors for the evaluation of the design forces at the ultimate limit state. Such specifications could lead to an extremely conservative design in some cases and to unsafe design in other cases, since these factors do not represent the actual behaviour of the bridge at that state. Under a moving truck, the bridge exhibits forces which are significantly greater than those under a static truck load. The Ontario Highway Bridge Design Code specifies the dynamic load allowance as a factor of the first flexural frequency of the bridge based on the beam theory. This latter theory is reliable in the case of right bridges without transverse diaphragms. However, in the case of skew bridges or bridges with transverse diaphragms the use of the beam theory leads to substantial errors in the determination of the first flexural frequency and hence the dynamic load allowance. In this dissertation, the predictions of the elastic and the ultimate behaviours of single span simply supported and continuous two-span skew composite steel-concrete bridges are presented. The dynamic response of such bridges is also investigated. A finite element analytical model based on the ABAQUS program, is used for the analyses. The analytical model was verified and substantiated by results from tests on six single span simply supported and three continuous skew composite steel-concrete bridge models. The finite element model is employed to conduct six extensive parametric studies on prototype skew composite bridges, including more than 2500 bridge cases. A statistical package for best fit is used to generate empirical formulas for the following: (i) elastic shear and moment distribution factors for simply supported and continuous skew composite bridges; (ii) ultimate span and support moment distribution factors for continuous skew composite bridges; and, (iii) first flexural frequency of such bridges. The following design parameters were considered when appropriate: angle of skew; bridge aspect ratio; girder spacing; number of lanes; number of girders; the effect of transverse intermediate diaphragms; longitudinal and transverse flexural rigidities; longitudinal and transverse ultimate moments of resistance of the bridge sections; eccentric and concentric truck loading cases; effect of dead load; and, the span ratio. From the results of this design oriented dissertation, the engineer would be able to design skew composite bridges more reliably and economically. Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering.
