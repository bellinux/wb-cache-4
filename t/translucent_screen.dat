40|$|Based on {{a number}} of {{workshops}} delivered to BA fine art students across all years and two institutions, this paper examines a selection of experimental results from participants. It also includes a discussion on the workshop methodology of spatial mark making and how this {{can be used as a}} tool for exploring surfaces, drawn interventions, and participatory group works. We ‘draw’ on surfaces but, by moving the ‘mark’ off that surface, and allowing it to be ‘seen’ in more than on space, there is a subtle (but noticeable) shift in the perceptual and conceptual analysis of these new marks. They exist in a ‘space’ between sculpture, installation and drawing. Their unfamiliar location offers an opportunity to look more closely – a state of ‘slow’ reading. Using light from lo-fi, semi-redundant sources, including 35 mm and overhead projectors, these workshops examine methods of manifesting marks on multiple <b>translucent</b> <b>screens,</b> existing architecture, smoke, columns of steam, clouds of water and rapidly oscillating webs manipulated in real-time by workshop participants. Many of the results experienced within the workshops are pseudo three-dimensional, creating marks, which appear to be solid and can be viewed from multiple angles. This raises questions about our perception of the ‘solid’ and the ‘flat mark’ as well as prompting discussions around validity of the process (particularly in fine art), the place of the spectacle in contemporary art practice and how much the tail is wagging the dog...|$|R

50|$|Like typical Japanese houses, Ruth Fairfax House's walls {{consisted}} of movable shoji (wood and <b>translucent</b> paper <b>screens</b> to filter the light between the exterior and interior) and fusuma (heavier paper mache partitions between interior spaces to provide privacy).

50|$|Shadow play {{which is}} also known as shadow puppetry is an ancient form of {{storytelling}} and entertainment which uses flat articulated cut-out figures (shadow puppets) which are held between a source of light and a <b>translucent</b> <b>screen</b> or scrim.

50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, a few {{libraries}} {{began to}} implement microfilm as a means of preserving records. A 1904 fire in the National Library of Turin that destroyed more than half the manuscripts stored there raised concerns of preservation of unique and rare materials. In 1905, these issues were addressed at the Congres International pour la reproduction des Manuscripts, des Monnaies et des Sceaux. It was decided that a photographic library would be established in all libraries. In 1956, Unesco set up a special microfilm unit with the intention of visiting various countries to micro film books, documents, and other cultural material in danger of being destroyed and those which are irreplaceable. This special unit also trained technicians to handle microfilm. Microfilm readers are stored in special rooms known as “Reading rooms”, with two prevalent types of readers. The first is for use of transparent microphotographs and the other used for micro opaque cards. In modern translucent microfilm readers, light is projected into a film producing an enlarged image of the film on a <b>translucent</b> <b>screen,</b> and in opaque readers the same process occurs except the image in on an opaque screen. In using a <b>translucent</b> <b>screen,</b> the image can be seen in daylight, provided no direct sunlight in on the screen.

50|$|Four {{specific}} conceptual {{features were}} {{highlighted by the}} University of Architecture and Urbanism in Bucharest in May 2013 who granted Dominique Perrault the title of “Doctor Honoris Causa”. “The first feature, which is tightly connected to an imperative need of enriching the architectural language, regards the eloquent interpretation of some sources coming from artistic minimalism and conceptual art. With Dominique Perrault, the architectural design vocabulary is heading towards a reduction of syntax, not of morphology. The second concerns his open, flexible approach that accepts uncertainties and rejects dogmatism and the critique of the privileged role of style and composition in the modern architectural discourse. The third feature highlights the idea of how architecture should {{be understood as a}} part of landscape within the topography of fundamental relations. The fourth emphasizes his experience with space and materiality. Being inspired by the lesson of modernism, the curtain façades, detached from structure and enhanced by light, transparent or <b>translucent</b> <b>screens</b> of glass or metal seem to be a tribute to contemporary technologies, yet are not subservient to them. Innovation often penetrates the engineering level.”According to Frederic Migayrou, “All of Dominique Perrault’s work questions the figural aspect of architecture, its ability to provide meaning, to build a dynamic image woven out of social and cultural values. … Dominique Perrault weaves his position between rationalism that seeks to articulate laws for the composition of typological elements, and a structuralist understanding of architectural syntax, thereby increasing the possibilities of interplay between very disparate scales of symbolic values.” At the crossroads of disciplines, Luis Fernandez-Galiano reminds that “it is frequent to describe Perrault’s work in terms of the great tradition of French geometric monumentality; it is inevitable to relate his bold gestures in this area with that affirmative urbanism which treats nature as voluntary geography; and it is necessary to interpret the almost innocent simplicity of his fundamental drawings {{in the light of the}} conceptual or minimal practices which extend up to the limits of ‘land art’ and ‘arte povera’.|$|R

50|$|A basic DOF adapter {{usually has}} four {{components:}} a macro lens, an optional plano-convex lens, a <b>translucent</b> focusing <b>screen,</b> {{and finally a}} photographic lens of the user's choice. On camcorders without sufficient macro capability, a macro lens, preferably an achromatic doublet (to minimize chromatic aberration), is usually attached directly to the camcorder so that the camcorder can zoom in {{and focus on the}} focusing screen. Without the macro lens, certain camcorders would be unable to zoom in well enough to frame the entire focusing screen and still achieve sharp focus. The optional plano-convex lens is used to avoid vignetting in the image. The focusing screen is where the photographic lens image is projected. The screen must be placed at precisely the correct distance from the flange focal mount of whatever lens is being used (most popularly the Canon FD or Nikon F mount), referred to as the flange back distance. Finally, the front lens is a photographic or cinema lens that projects the image desired onto the focusing screen.|$|R
40|$|ENGLISH:The {{technology}} of immaterial projection systems are in constant development {{and will be}} more applicable {{on the market in}} the future. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} color management to improve the image reproduction on these displays, as they are more complex to manage than normal fixed screens. The FogScreen® projection screen produces a thin curtain of “dry” fog that serves as a <b>translucent</b> projection <b>screen,</b> displaying images floating in the air. This thesis aims to optimize the viewing experience by considering the technical aspect as well as the application aspect in order to reach reliable results, as they both have equal impact on the viewing experience. The technical approach is the characterization of the device in terms of color management and profile generation. Based on the device’s characteristics, we are able to determine how the image projection can be optimized under given viewing conditions and installation settings. Furthermore, the application aspect is approached by designing innovative concepts for Norwegian companies. The concepts include consideration of location, the screen’s functionality and purpose, media content management and business innovation...|$|R
