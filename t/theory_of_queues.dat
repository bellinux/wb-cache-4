40|$|Abstract. Queues are {{a widely}} used data {{structure}} in programming languages. They also provide an important synchronization mechanism in modeling distributed protocols. In this paper we extend the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>queues</b> with a length function that maps a queue to its size, {{resulting in a}} combined <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>queues</b> and Presburger arithmetic. This extension provides a natural but tight coupling between the two theories, and hence the general Nelson-Oppen combination method for decision procedures is not applicable. We present a decision procedure for the quantifier-free theory and a quantifier elimination procedure for the first-order theory that can remove a block of existential quantifiers in one step. 1 Introduction. Queues are a widely used data structure in programming languages. They also provide an important synchronization mechanism in modeling distributed protocols. To verify programs or protocols using queues we {{must be able to}} reason about this data structure. Single theory decision procedures, however, ar...|$|E

Our analysis shows that the limited exchange mode, in which the bridge residence time in a piconet is limited, performs better and has a wider stability region than the complete exchange mode in which the bridge stays in the piconet until all queued packets are exchanged. Simulations show that this scheduling approach offers good performance and excellent scalability, while maintaining scatternet stability...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{discusses}} the minimization of end-to-end delays {{in a small}} Bluetooth scatternet with a Slave/Slave bridge. We assume that both piconets operate under exhaustive scheduling policy, that slaves generate packet bursts, that burst arrivals follow Poisson distribution, and {{that the size of}} packet bursts follows geometric distribution. Using the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>queues</b> with vacations, we investigate the possibility of choosing scatternet parameters so as to minimize the aforementioned delays. We show that the minimization of delay should use the time interval between bridge exchanges in order to minimize inter-piconet traffic, since the intra-piconet traffic delay is less sensitive to the actual value of the time interval between bridge exchanges. Then, we present a load adaptive algorithm that would change this time dynamically, and show how the end-to-end delay is indeed minimized in this manner. Simulation results confirm that the algorithm is able to achieve minimum endto-end delay for inter-piconet traffic under a wide range of traffic loads...|$|E
