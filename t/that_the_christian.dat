5|$|Bethlehem paid {{taxes on}} wheat, barley and grapes. The Muslims and Christians were {{organized}} into separate communities, each having its own leader. Five leaders represented {{the village in}} the mid-16th century, three of whom were Muslims. Ottoman tax records suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> population was slightly more prosperous or grew more grain than grapes (the former being a more valuable commodity).|$|E
5|$|Christian {{communities}} grew {{quickly in}} many parts of the empire (and especially in the East) after 260, when Gallienus brought peace to the Church. The data to calculate the figures are nearly non-existent, but the historian and sociologist Keith Hopkins has given crude and tentative estimates for Christian population in the 3rd century. Hopkins estimates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> community grew from a population of 1.1 million in 250 to a population of 6 million by 300, about 10% of the empire's total population. Christians even expanded into the countryside, where they had never been numerous before. Churches in the later 3rd century were no longer as inconspicuous as they had been in the first and second. Large churches were prominent in certain major cities throughout the empire. The church in Nicomedia even sat on a hill overlooking the imperial palace. These new churches probably represented not only absolute growth in Christian population, but also the increasing affluence of the Christian community. In some areas where Christians were influential, such as North Africa and Egypt, traditional deities were losing credibility.|$|E
25|$|Many Protestants believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Church, as {{described}} in the Bible, has a twofold character that can be described as the visible and invisible church.|$|E
5000|$|Crescens called <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> atheotatous, [...] "the most atheist ones", and Justin {{admitted}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> {{were indeed}} atheists regarding {{their attitude toward}} the pagan gods. The atheotatous accusation seems to be widespread among the pagan view of <b>Christians,</b> given <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> had no temples or statues of deities and did not perform sacrifices. This made <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> comparable to other uncivilised peoples who had no gods either, such as the barbaric Scythians or nomadic Libyans. The charge had a long life and survived even into the fourth century.|$|R

500|$|Reports by Joachim Miranda and the Portuguese Government confirm <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> were {{forcibly}} circumcised {{and converted}} to Islam. These Christians then openly practised Islam. Some writers hold <b>the</b> view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> did not voluntary submit to these conversions. Other Christian missionaries also {{appealed to the}} Roman Catholic Church to intervene on behalf of <b>the</b> captive <b>Christians.</b> A priest also {{wrote a letter to}} the Holy See to put pressure on Tipu to allow the priests.|$|R
25|$|Church Fathers like Ignatius of Antioch, Irenaeus, Tertullian and Cyprian held to {{the view}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Church was a visible entity, not an {{invisible}} body of believers.|$|E
25|$|During this time, news {{spread among}} the {{reservations}} of a Paiute prophet named Wovoka, {{founder of the}} Ghost Dance religion. He had a vision <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Messiah, Jesus Christ, had returned to Earth {{in the form of}} a Native American.|$|E
25|$|A modern Jesuit scholar {{has claimed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> {{theology}} {{contributed significantly to}} the revival of human dissection and autopsy by providing a new socio-religious and cultural context in which the human cadaver was no longer seen as sacrosanct.|$|E

500|$|Historian Ahmad Saeed states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> {{acted as}} spies and guided the British whilst {{historian}} Praxy Fernandes points out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> helped Colonel Campbell in the Mangalore fort and adjoining towns by {{providing them with}} rice, vegetables, meat, men, and money. In {{a letter to his}} superiors, Colonel Campbell strongly commended the role of the Bombay Natives regiment. This was led by a native major named Francis Pinto who put up a brave defence of the fort. He also refers to these troops as the [...] "Native Christians". Fernandes further points out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> had entered into a league with Mysore traitors Kasim Ali and Mohammed Ali, who were enemies of Tipu, and had plotted with the English to overthrow him. He also states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Head of the Congregation of Monte Mariano Church at Farangipet, near Mangalore, provided the British garrison with 1,000 bags of rice.|$|R
50|$|The Dialogue {{utilizes}} {{the literary}} device {{of an intellectual}} conversation between Justin and Trypho, a Jew. The concluding section propounds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> are <b>the</b> true people of God.|$|R
25|$|Hubbard {{described}} the belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> heaven is “the product of two implants dating {{back more than}} 43 trillion years.” He said further that heaven is a “false dream” that leads thetans to a goal that does not exist, and persuades them of the singularity of this life.|$|E
25|$|Despite his cynicism, Nicolas {{is still}} {{convinced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> teachings are correct, and he cannot understand Lestat's unwillingness to believe.

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Portuguese forces were {{strongly}} outnumbered, the Muslim armies were weakened by internal leadership problems, {{which led to}} Afonso Henriques's victory and subsequently his proclamation as King of the Portuguese, as Afonso I, with the support from his troops, vanquishing and slaying, so legend says, five Moorish kings.|$|E

50|$|The {{narrative}} {{ability of}} Orosius should also not be overlooked. The author {{had a clear}} objective: <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> be defended from the non-Christian Roman’s accusations <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sacking of Rome in 410 was a reprimand because <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> had forsaken <b>the</b> city’s traditional pantheon of gods.|$|R

25|$|The English writer Godfrey Higgins {{suggested}} {{in his book}} Anacalypsis (1836) that Jesus was a dark brown skinned Indo-Aryan from North India.

25|$|Paul Maier {{states that}} a {{comparison}} of Eusebius' reference with the 10th-century Arabic version of the Testimonium due to Agapius of Hierapolis indicates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> interpolation present in the Testimonium must have come early, before Eusebius.

25|$|The Chilean Congress {{conducted}} a runoff vote between the leading candidates, Allende {{and former president}} Jorge Alessandri, and, keeping with tradition, chose Allende {{by a vote of}} 153 to 35.

25|$|American New Testament {{scholar and}} former Baptist pastor Robert M.

5|$|Severine Silva {{points out}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> of Canara {{were eager to}} get rid of Tipu. The History of the Diocese of Mangalore by J. Moore and Angelus Francis Xavier Maffei also purports to show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> of Canara were charged with {{assisting}} the British during the Second Anglo-Mysore War. Tipu made a number of accusations against <b>the</b> <b>Christians,</b> including <b>that</b> they had invited the British to invade Canara in 1781–82, furnished supplies to and otherwise assisted General Matthews' army when it landed and took possession of Onore, accompanied the British detachment to Mangalore, provided it with supplies {{both before and after the}} march, aided the British in repairing breaches made when the fort was besieged by Tipu and plundered the state treasury at Nuggur when that fortress fell to General Matthews.|$|R
50|$|An {{advantage}} for <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> was their numerical superiority in guns and cannon aboard their ships, {{as well as}} the superior quality of the Spanish infantry. It is estimated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> had 1,815 guns, while the Turks had only 750 with insufficient ammunition. <b>The</b> <b>Christians</b> embarked with their much improved arquebusier and musketeer forces, while the Ottomans trusted in their greatly feared composite bowmen.|$|R
25|$|Similarly, {{supporters}} of Aramaic primacy—of the view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> New Testament or its sources were originally {{written in the}} Aramaic language—seek to prove their case by showing that difficult passages in the existing Greek text of the New Testament make much better sense when back-translated to Aramaic: that, for example, some incomprehensible references are in fact Aramaic puns that do not work in Greek.|$|E
25|$|The English school master George Robert Stowe Mead {{argued in}} 1903 that Jesus had existed, {{but that he}} had lived in 100 BCE. Mead based his {{argument}} on the Talmud, which pointed to Jesus being crucified c. 100 BCE. In Mead's view, this would mean <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> gospels are mythical. Tom Harpur has compared Mead's impact on myth theory to that of Bruno Bauer and Arthur Drews.|$|E
25|$|Most Christian traditions teach {{belief in}} {{life after death}} as a central and {{indispensable}} tenet of their faith. Critics argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> conception of the afterlife is inconsistent with that described in the Old Testament. George E. Mendenhall believes there is no concept of immortality or life after death in the Old Testament. The presumption is that the deceased are inert, lifeless, and engaging in no activity.|$|E
60|$|And now, to the astonishment {{of priests}} and congregations, the silent, thoughtful, solitary Ulpius {{suddenly}} started from his long repose, and stood forth the fiery {{advocate of the}} rights of his invaded worship. In a few days the fame of his addresses to the Pagans who still attended the rites of Serapis spread throughout the whole city. The boldest among <b>the</b> <b>Christians,</b> as they passed the temple walls, involuntarily trembled when they heard the vehemence of the applause which arose from the audience of the inspired priest. Addressed to all varieties of age and character, these harangues woke an echo in every breast they reached. To the young they were clothed in all the poetry of the worship for which they pleaded. They dwelt on the altars of Venus <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> would lay waste; on <b>the</b> woodlands <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> would disenchant of their Dryads; on <b>the</b> hallowed Arts <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> would arise and destroy. To the aged they called up remembrances of the glories of the past achieved through the favour of the gods; of ancestors who had died in their service; of old forgotten loves, and joys, and successes that had grown and prospered under the gentle guardianship of the deities of old--while the unvarying burden of their conclusion to all was <b>the</b> reiterated assertion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> illustrious Macrinus had died a victim to the toleration of <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> sect.|$|R
50|$|In the Dialogue with Trypho, {{after an}} {{introductory}} section, Justin undertakes to show <b>that</b> Christianity is <b>the</b> new law for all men, {{and to prove}} from Scripture <b>that</b> Jesus is <b>the</b> Christ.
