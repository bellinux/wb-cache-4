5|$|During {{the first}} <b>two</b> <b>centuries</b> <b>of</b> its existence, the Roman Republic {{expanded}} {{through a combination}} of conquest and alliance, from central Italy to the entire Italian peninsula. By the following century, it included North Africa, most of the Iberian Peninsula, and what is now southern France. Two centuries after that, {{towards the end of the}} 1st century BC, it included the rest of modern France, Greece, and much of the eastern Mediterranean. By this time, internal tensions led to a series of civil wars, culminating with the assassination of Julius Caesar, which led to the transition from republic to empire.|$|E
5|$|Only three Sinhala books survive {{from the}} Anuradhapura period.

Dampiya Atuva Gatapadaya is another, and is a {{glossary}} for the Pali Dhammapadatthakatha, providing Sinhala words and synonyms for Pali words. The third book is Mula Sikha Ha Sikhavalanda, a set of disciplinary rules for Buddhist monks. Both these have been written during the last <b>two</b> <b>centuries</b> <b>of</b> the Anuradhapura period.|$|E

5|$|The Siege of Patras in 805 or 807 was {{undertaken}} by the local Slavic tribes of the Peloponnese, reportedly with aid from an Arab fleet. The siege's failure, attributed to the miraculous intervention of the city's patron, Saint Andrew, marked the consolidation of Byzantine control over the Peloponnese peninsula after <b>two</b> <b>centuries</b> <b>of</b> Slavic rule over its western half. It also {{marked the beginning of}} the ascendancy of the Metropolis of Patras in the peninsula's ecclesiastical affairs.|$|E
5|$|The stave churches {{owe their}} {{longevity}} to architectural innovations that protected these large, complex wooden structures against water rot, precipitation, wind, and extreme temperatures. Most {{important was the}} introduction of massive sills underneath the staves (posts) {{to prevent them from}} rotting. Over the <b>two</b> <b>centuries</b> <b>of</b> stave church construction, this building type evolved to an advanced art and science. After the Reformation, however, no new stave churches were built. New churches were mainly of stone or horizontal log buildings with notched corners. Most old stave churches disappeared because of redundancy, neglect or deterioration, or because they were too small to accommodate larger congregations, and too impractical according to later standards.|$|E
5|$|While historians value {{contemporary}} skaldic poetry highly as {{the most}} accurate source available, {{it must be remembered}} that the poems are not preserved independently but as quotations in the kings' sagas. After <b>two</b> <b>centuries</b> <b>of</b> oral preservation, there is often doubt that a verse was accurately remembered and correctly attributed. Furthermore, skaldic poetry did not primarily aim at giving information but at artistically rendering facts already known to the hearers. Historians frequently fall back on the less reliable but more detailed accounts of the sagas.|$|E

5|$|The Empire {{recovered}} {{again during}} the Komnenian restoration, such that by the 12th century Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest European city. However, it was delivered a mortal blow during the Fourth Crusade, when Constantinople was sacked in 1204 and the territories that the Empire formerly governed were divided into competing Byzantine Greek and Latin realms. Despite the eventual recovery of Constantinople in 1261, the Byzantine Empire remained {{only one of several}} small rival states in the area for the final <b>two</b> <b>centuries</b> <b>of</b> its existence. Its remaining territories were progressively annexed by the Ottomans over the 15th century. The Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453 finally ended the Byzantine Empire.|$|E
5|$|Following {{more than}} <b>two</b> <b>centuries</b> <b>of</b> Arab rule, Armenia gained {{independence}} {{under the leadership}} of the Bagratid (Bagratuni) dynasty around 885. King Ashot III made Ani capital in 961, after which the city emerged as a prosperous urban center with 100,000 residents at its height. The construction of the cathedral began in 989. The architect Trdat was commissioned by Bagratid King Smbat II to build a cathedral in the new capital of the Armenian kingdom. The construction was halted when Smbat died in 989, according to an inscription on the south wall. Meanwhile, Trdat was hired to direct the repairs of the dome of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, which had collapsed in an earthquake. Trdat returned from Constantinople in 993. The construction was continued and completed by Queen Katranide (Katramide), the wife of King Gagik I, Smbat's brother and successor. It was completed either in 1001 or 1010. According to Christina Maranci the generally accepted date of completion is 1001, but it may have extended until 1010. The contradiction is based on the reading of the inscription of the cathedral's northern wall. The cathedral served as the seat of the catholicos, the head of the Armenian Apostolic Church from its foundation in 1001 until the mid-11th century (1046 or 1051). Thus, for around half a century Ani was both the religious and secular center of Armenia.|$|E
5|$|The Church in England {{was a major}} {{landowner}} {{throughout the}} medieval period and played {{an important part in}} the development of agriculture and rural trade in the first <b>two</b> <b>centuries</b> <b>of</b> Norman rule. The Cistercian order first arrived in England in 1128, establishing around 80 new monastic houses over the next few years; the wealthy Augustinians also established themselves and expanded to occupy around 150 houses, all supported by agricultural estates, many of them in the north of England. By the 13th century these and other orders were acquiring new lands and had become major economic players both as landowners and as middlemen in the expanding wool trade. In particular, the Cistercians led the development of the grange system. Granges were separate manors in which the fields were all cultivated by the monastic officials, rather than being divided up between demesne and rented fields, and became known for trialling new agricultural techniques during the period. Elsewhere, many monasteries had significant economic impact on the landscape, such as the monks of Glastonbury, responsible for the draining of the Somerset Levels to create new pasture land.|$|E

5|$|Total {{production}} of slate in Wales declined from 54,000tons in 1958 to 22,000tons in 1970. The Diffwys quarry at Blaenau Ffestiniog closed in 1955 after almost <b>two</b> <b>centuries</b> <b>of</b> operation. The nearby Votty and Bowydd quarries closed in 1963. In 1969, the Dinorwig Quarry was closed, and over 300 quarrymen lost their jobs. The following year the Dorothea Quarry in the Nantlle Valley and the Braichgoch Slate Mine near Corris announced their closure. The Oakeley mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog closed in 1971, but was later reopened by another company. By 1972, {{the number of}} men employed in the North Wales slate industry was down to under 1,000. There was little alternative employment in the slate-producing areas, and the closures resulted in high unemployment and a drop in population as younger people moved away to find work. In 1979, after a long struggle, the government recognized silicosis as an industrial disease meriting compensation. There was an increase in demand for slate in the 1980s, and although this came too late for many quarries there was still some production in the Blaenau Ffestiniog area at the Oakeley, Llechwedd and Cwt-y-Bugail quarries, though the bulk of roofing slate production was at the Penrhyn Quarry. Further mechanization was introduced, with a computerized laser beam being used to aid the sawing of the slate blocks.|$|E
