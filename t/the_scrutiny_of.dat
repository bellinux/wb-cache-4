5|$|By May 2009 LCR {{had become}} {{insolvent}} {{and the government}} received agreement to use state aid to purchase the line and also to open it up to competition to allow other services to use it apart from Eurostar. LCR's hitherto wholly owned subsidiary, HS1 Ltd, thus became {{the property of the}} Secretary of State for Transport. On 12 October 2009 a proposal was announced to sell £16billion of state assets including HS1 Ltd in the following two years to cut UK public debt. The government announced on 5 November 2010 that a concession to operate the line for 30years had been sold for £2.1billion to a consortium of Canadian investors. Under the concession, HS1Ltd has the rights to sell access to track and to the four international stations (St Pancras, Stratford, Ebbsfleet and Ashford) on a commercial basis, under <b>the</b> <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> the Office of Rail Regulation. At the end of 30years, ownership of the assets will revert to government.|$|E
5|$|D'Oliveira {{was aware}} of the {{political}} discussions surrounding him during 1968, and the pressure on him was intensified by <b>the</b> <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> his supporters and opponents in England and South Africa. Conscious of his failure in the West Indies, he made a concerted effort to improve his batting. He scored runs consistently and was chosen for England's first Test of 1968, against Australia in early June. He was very successful, scoring 87 not out and taking two wickets. After England lost, however, D'Oliveira was blamed in some sections of the press. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted that he failed as a bowler, and his innings was difficult to evaluate as England had effectively lost the match by that stage. Even so, most observers expected him to retain his place, including the watching South Africans.|$|E
5|$|Development for {{multiple}} platforms is profitable, but difficult. Optimizations needed for one platform architecture {{do not necessarily}} translate to others. Individual platforms such as the Sega Genesis and PlayStation 3 are seen as difficult to develop for compared to their competitors, and developers are not yet fully accustomed to new technologies such as multi-core processors and hyper-threading. Multi-platform releases are increasingly common, but not all differences between editions on multiple platforms can be fully explained by hardware alone, and there remain franchise stalwarts that exist solely on one system. Developers for new platforms such as handheld and mobile systems {{do not have to}} operate under the pressure of $20 million budgets and <b>the</b> <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> publishers' marketing experts.|$|E

5|$|The maximum {{tenure in}} office was nine years, but {{every three years}} {{officials}} were graded on their performance by senior officials. If they were graded as superior then they were promoted, if graded adequate then they retained their ranks, and if graded inadequate they were demoted one rank. In extreme cases, officials would be dismissed or punished. Only capital officials of grade 4 and above were exempt from <b>the</b> <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> recorded evaluation, although {{they were expected to}} confess any of their faults. There were over 4,000 school instructors in county and prefectural schools who were subject to evaluations every nine years. The Chief Instructor on the prefectural level was classified as equal to a second-grade county graduate. The Supervisorate of Imperial Instruction oversaw the education of the heir apparent to the throne; this office was headed by a Grand Supervisor of Instruction, who was ranked as first class of grade three.|$|E
5|$|The new {{treaties}} gave minorities {{the right}} to appeal directly to the League or UN General Assembly. In {{the case of the}} Mandates and the UN Partition Plan for Palestine compromissory clauses provide for the International Court's jurisdiction. The victorious powers attempted to ensure the stable development of the region between defeated Germany and Soviet Russia, a region characterized by the existence of many ethnic groups and the emergence of new nations. The idea behind the Minority Treaties was that by subjecting those countries to <b>the</b> <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> others and to the threat of sanction and intervention from the newly created international body, the League of Nations, the rights of minorities would be safeguarded.|$|E
5|$|The Brindle Tails {{desperately wanted}} Clayton {{out of the}} governor's office. Conveniently, Lieutenant Governor James M. Johnson was a Brindle Tail, so the natural course of action {{was to try to}} get rid of Clayton and let Johnson succeed him. Clayton was well aware of their plans, and when he left the state briefly for New York on {{business}} concerning the Holford Bonds, he informed no one. When Johnson, who was at home some distance from the capital, found out he tried to head to the capital to take control and have Clayton arrested and impeached. He arrived too late. Subsequently, after Johnson made a speech demanding changes in the administration, the Minstrels started to target Johnson. On January 30, 1871, they introduced articles of impeachment in the General Assembly against him. The chief charge was that Johnson, acting as the President of the Senate, had administered the oath of office to Joseph Brooks, who had recently been elected as state senator, and then recognized him on the floor. Although this was legitimately within his powers as the lieutenant governor to do, he escaped impeachment by only two votes. <b>The</b> <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> the proceedings seriously damaged his reputation, even though he had done nothing wrong, and his political career never recovered.|$|E

5|$|These {{reforms were}} also {{significant}} {{in that they}} gave to Senate committees the role of examining the budget (what {{is referred to as}} the estimates process or estimates hearings), which had hitherto been confined to the Senate and its committee of the whole. The role of the committees was enhanced by three subsequent developments. First, in 1982 <b>the</b> <b>Scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> Bills Committee was established, which, in examining all bills, played a role that complemented that of the examination of all delegated legislation by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. Second, in 1989 the Senate adopted procedures for the systematic referral of bills to committees, increasing the level of legislative scrutiny taking place within parliament. Third, in 1993, the committees adopted a more extensive procedure for consideration of the budget, creating a second opportunity each year for Senators to follow up issues identified during the initial budget estimates hearings. These second hearings are referred to as supplementary budget estimates. Though the committee system was restructured in 1994, 2006 and again in 2009, the range of functions has remained essentially the same.|$|E

5000|$|The Simon Iff {{stories were}} written {{during a visit}} to New Orleans in December 1916, {{primarily}} as a means of alleviating Crowley's financial hardships. The mystic was verging on bankruptcy, a result of his lifestyle, and extravagant self-publishing, while having never earned a wage. The initial collection of six stories which Crowley penned would be labelled <b>The</b> <b>Scrutinies</b> <b>of</b> Simon Iff. Crowley would later write twelve more stories under the title Simon Iff in America, six stories as Simon Iff Abroad, and two final stories as Simon Iff Psychoanalyst. <b>The</b> <b>Scrutinies</b> <b>of</b> Simon Iff were first published in 1917-1918 in the New York publication The International under the pseudonym Edward Kelly ( [...] presumably a nod to Edward Kelley, the Elizabethan alchemist and enochian magician). There is an edition of The Scutinies of Simon Iff published by Teitan Press: , while a 2012 Wordsworth Editions release (...) , under their [...] "Tales of Mystery & the Supernatural" [...] line, contains the complete works. As with most of Crowley's work, the Iff stories are practically unheard of outside of occult circles.|$|R

25|$|The {{prevailing}} public arguments, time of onset, {{and pace}} of reforms varied by country.

25|$|Finally, two London laundry owners, whose bills totalled {{just under}} £50, filed a writ {{demanding}} she declare bankruptcy {{if she was}} unable to settle her accounts, and Lawrence's financial affairs came under <b>the</b> <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> the Official Receiver.

25|$|After the verdict, the way {{in which}} the court had functioned was disputed, first in Germany (by former Nazi {{officials}} who had regained some power due to anti-Communist positions with the occupation forces), then later in the United States (by Congressmen from heavily German-American areas of the Midwest). The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which made no decision. The case then came under <b>the</b> <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> a sub-committee of the United States Senate.|$|E
