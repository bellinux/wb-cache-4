5|$|Nathan {{throws a}} mix of four pitches. His main pitch, a four-seam fastball was once <b>thrown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-to-upper 90s, but now settles between 91 and 94mph. His main {{breaking}} ball is a hard slider in the upper 80s, occasionally even touching 90. He uses the slider less frequently against left-handed hitters, preferring to use a curveball in the low 80s. He also uses a two-seam fastball against lefties. His slider is his best swing-and-miss pitch, with a whiff rate of 42% since 2007.|$|E

As a result, many literary works written in Pahlavi script disappeared. During the Abbasid reign the Zoroastrians, {{for the first time}} became a minority in Iran. Nevertheless, there were instances of toleration during the Abbasid era, particularly under the reign of Al-Mu'tasim who flogged an imam and muezzin for destroying a fire-temple and replacing it with a mosque.|$|E
5|$|Samoa Joe went on {{to defend}} the TNA X Division Championship in a Three Way match against A.J. Syles and Christopher Daniels at Against All Odds in a rematch of their bout at Unbreakable in October 2005. On the January21 episode of Impact!, it was {{announced}} that Styles would face Joe for the title at Against All Odds. In the same telecast, Daniels accused Styles of trying to take his spot as the contender for the championship due to Styles having <b>thrown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> towel for Daniels. Styles argued that he was instead looking out for Daniels' health in the storyline. The following week on the January28 episode of Impact!, Zybysko announced that the three would compete in a Three Way match for the title at the show. Joe retained the title at the spectacle.|$|E

5|$|After Cadwallon ap Cadfan, {{the king}} of Gwynedd, in {{alliance}} with the pagan Penda of Mercia, killed Edwin of Deira in battle at Hatfield Chase in 633 (or 632, depending on when the years used by Bede are considered to have begun), Northumbria was split between its constituent kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira. Oswald's brother Eanfrith became king of Bernicia, but {{he was killed by}} Cadwallon in 634 (or 633) after attempting to negotiate peace. Subsequently, Oswald, {{at the head of a}} small army (possibly with the aid of allies from the north, the Scots and/or the Picts), met Cadwallon in battle at Heavenfield, near Hexham. Before the battle, Oswald had a wooden cross erected; he knelt down, holding the cross in position until enough earth had been <b>thrown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hole to make it stand firm. He then prayed and asked his army to join in.|$|E
5|$|An immaculate inning {{occurs in}} {{baseball}} when a pitcher in a half-inning of play throws only nine pitches, {{each of which}} is a strike and thus strikes out three consecutive batters. Immaculate innings are uncommon, rarer than the better known individual gameplay feats of a batter's hitting for the cycle and a pitcher's no hitter. Currently 84 different Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers have accomplished this feat for a total of 89 immaculate innings. The first one was pitched by John Clarkson of the Boston Beaneaters on June 4, 1889, in the third inning against the Philadelphia Quakers. Since then, only four players––Lefty Grove, Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson, and Sandy Koufax––have thrown an immaculate inning more than once in their careers. Koufax is the only pitcher to throw three of them. A record eight immaculate innings have been <b>thrown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2017 MLB season through August 8.|$|E

5|$|Sonderkommandos (special work crews {{forced to}} work at the gas chambers) wearing gas masks then dragged the bodies from the chamber. The victims' glasses, {{artificial}} limbs, jewelry, and hair were removed, and any dental work was extracted so the gold could be melted down. If the gas chamber was crowded, which they typically were, the corpses were found half-squatting, their skin discolored pink with red and green spots, with some found foaming at their mouths, or bleeding from their ears. The corpses were burned in the nearby incinerators, and the ashes were buried, <b>thrown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river, or used as fertilizer. With the Soviet Red Army approaching through Poland, the last mass gassing at Auschwitz took place on 30 October 1944. In November 1944, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, ordered gassing operations to cease across the Reich.|$|E
5|$|Some {{versions}} of the myth provide Set's motive for killing Osiris. According to a spell in the Pyramid Texts, Set is taking revenge for a kick Osiris gave him, whereas in a Late Period text, Set's grievance is that Osiris had sex with Nephthys, who is Set's consort and the fourth child of Geb and Nut. The murder itself is frequently alluded to, but never clearly described. The Egyptians believed that written words {{had the power to}} affect reality, so they avoided writing directly about profoundly negative events such as Osiris's death. Sometimes they denied his death altogether, even though the bulk of the traditions about him make it clear that he has been murdered. In some cases the texts suggest that Set {{takes the form of a}} wild animal, such as a crocodile or bull, to slay Osiris; in others they imply that Osiris's corpse is <b>thrown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water or that he is drowned. This latter tradition is the origin of the Egyptian belief that people who had drowned in the Nile were sacred. Even the identity of the victim is changeable in texts, as it is sometimes the god Haroeris, an elder form of Horus, who is murdered by Set and then avenged by another form of Horus, who is Haroeris's son by Isis.|$|E

25|$|Artist Thomas Baines was {{dismissed}} from the expedition {{on charges of}} theft (which he vigorously denied).

She died on 27 April 1862 from malaria and Livingstone continued his explorations. Attempts to navigate the Ruvuma River failed because of the continual fouling of the paddle wheels from the bodies <b>thrown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river by slave traders, and Livingstone's assistants gradually died or left him.|$|E
