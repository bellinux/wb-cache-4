5|$|Abbey of Our Lady (Vor Frue Kirke) was {{designed}} in 1878 by J.E. Gnudtzmann in the Neo-Romanesque style. The original Church of Our Lady {{from the early}} 12th century was pulled down after the Reformation because it was old and unstable, but the 12th-century tower and the original portal with sculpted decorations can still be seen. <b>The</b> <b>carved</b> pulpit dates to around 1581.|$|E
5|$|All five {{floors are}} {{connected}} by a central scale-and-platt staircase, added in the early 17th century to replace a turnpike stair in the south-west. The rooms of the upper floors have impressive panelling and decorated ceilings. The main hall, in the south part of the block, has been divided, but retains a large fireplace with <b>the</b> <b>carved</b> initials WS and JE, for William Sinclair and his wife Jean Edmonstone, and the date 1597.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1175 and 1490, Wells Cathedral {{has been}} {{described}} as “the most poetic of the English Cathedrals”. Much of the structure is in the Early English style and is greatly enriched by the deeply sculptural nature of the mouldings and the vitality of <b>the</b> <b>carved</b> capitals in a foliate style known as “stiff leaf”. The eastern end has retained much original glass, which is rare in England. The exterior has the finest Early English façade and a large central tower.|$|E

5|$|Parthian {{architecture}} adopted {{elements of}} Achaemenid and Greek architecture, but remained {{distinct from the}} two. The style is first attested at Mithridatkert/Nisa. The Round Hall of Nisa is similar to Hellenistic palaces, but different in that it forms a circle and vault inside a square space. However, the artwork of Nisa, including marble statues and <b>the</b> <b>carved</b> scenes on ivory rhyton vessels, is unquestionably influenced by Greek art.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>carved</b> {{representations}} of Adam and Eve {{appear on the}} uprights of the throne. The capitals on {{the arms of the}} throne show Cain beating Abel to death with a club to Mary's left, and Samson opening the lion's jaws to her left. The carvings on the architectural capitals depict Old Testament scenes, including the meeting of Abraham and Melchizedek and the Sacrifice of Isaac.|$|E
5|$|The {{church was}} shared for worship between the monks of Dunster Priory and the parishioners, however {{this led to}} several {{conflicts}} between them. One outcome was <b>the</b> <b>carved</b> rood screen which divided the church in two with the parish using the west chancel and the monks the east. It was restored in 1875–77 by George Edmund Street. The church has a cruciform plan with a central four-stage tower, built in 1443 with diagonal buttresses, a stair turret and single bell-chamber windows.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>carving</b> shows Spokan Garry {{holding a}} Book of Common Prayer {{on his lap}} while {{offering}} a sign of peace. <b>The</b> <b>carving</b> is on <b>the</b> wooded path between {{the upper and lower}} parking lots, near the columbarium.|$|R

5|$|The {{conquest of}} Britain {{continued}} {{under the command}} of Gnaeus Julius Agricola, who expanded the Roman Empire as far as Caledonia, or modern day Scotland. Domitian also founded a new legion in 82, the Legio I Minervia, to fight against the Chatti. Domitian is also credited on the easternmost evidence of Roman presence, the rock inscription near Boyukdash mountain, in present-day Azerbaijan. As judged by <b>the</b> <b>carved</b> titles of Caesar, Augustus and Germanicus, the related march took place between 84 and 96 AD.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{portion of}} the {{existing}} building {{is part of the}} north tower, which was built in the late 14th century. The north aisle, together with the nave and its arcades, dates from the early 15th century, while the south aisle, with its fine hammer-beam roof, was added about 1450. <b>The</b> <b>carved</b> stone font was placed in the church soon afterwards, dating from about 1480.|$|E
5|$|The {{preliminary}} matter is introduced by an iconic {{image of the}} Virgin and Child (folio 7v). This miniature is the first representation of the Virgin in a Western manuscript. Mary is shown in an odd mixture of frontal and three-quarter pose. This miniature also bears a stylistic similarity to <b>the</b> <b>carved</b> image on the lid of St. Cuthbert's coffin of 698. The iconography of the miniature may derive from an Eastern or Coptic icon.|$|E

5|$|By 1725, {{the castle}} had become ruinous. Early in the century, {{the remains of}} the castle was sold to the town of Weymouth, whose people reused some of the stone to {{construct}} their new town bridge. Local tradition in the 19th century maintained that several houses in Weymouth were also constructed using stone taken from the castle. In 1825, <b>the</b> <b>carved</b> stone Elizabethan arms of the castle were moved to All Saints Church in Wyke Regis. Captains continued to be formally appointed, however, and Gabriel Stewart held the post as late as 1795.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1902, Potter sketched the {{interior}} of the third Lakefield Cottage belonging to a Mrs. Lord. These drawings included a watercolour and pen-and-ink sketches of the living-room, pen-and-ink sketches of the pots of geraniums on the living-room window sill, the entrance passage, the pantry, the stairs, some of the upstairs rooms, and details of <b>the</b> <b>carved</b> oak furniture. In some of the sketches Potter roughly outlined a cat. She also sketched the village including the sloping path down to the Lakefield Cottages and the post office door. These became the backgrounds for The Pie and The Patty-Pan.|$|E
5|$|Other basic {{defensive}} measures {{included the}} removal of signposts, milestones (some had <b>the</b> <b>carved</b> details obscured with cement) and railway station signs making {{it more likely that}} an enemy would become confused. Petrol pumps were removed from service stations near the coast and there were careful preparations for the destruction of those that were left. Detailed plans were made for destroying anything that might prove useful to the invader such as port facilities, key roads and rolling stock. In certain areas non-essential citizens were evacuated. In the county of Kent, 40% of the population was relocated; in East Anglia, the figure was 50%.|$|E
50|$|The cave {{was covered}} with wood, and in 1777 a fire {{destroyed}} <b>the</b> original <b>carve</b> of la Santina. <b>The</b> current <b>carve</b> is of 16th century and was donated to the Sanctuary by the Cathedral of Oviedo in 1778. <b>The</b> <b>carving</b> of <b>the</b> Virgin is painted wood, sweet features, holds the Child and a golden rose.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>carving</b> {{skiing is}} not the same as the {{application}} of <b>the</b> <b>carving</b> skiing or skis in the classic alpine disciplines. <b>The</b> <b>Carving</b> World Cup is one of the best indicators of that. The main features, so called ski-telemark, are <b>the</b> features of <b>carving</b> skis as well, but now more emphasized. In contrast to earlier four skiing categories, there are at least eight of them at the moment. The greater number of the categories, the more precise selection of skis is. The development of new technology has definitely affected the skiing technique itself and new changes thus have made better results and qualitative skiing, which altogether resulted in modification of the old schools and their adjustment to new challenges...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>carving</b> was {{conceived}} by Mrs. C. Helen Plane, a charter {{member of the}} United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC). The Venable Brothers, owners of the mountain, deeded the north face of the mountain to the UDC in 1916. The UDC was given 12 years to complete a sizable Civil War monument. Gutzon Borglum was commissioned to do <b>the</b> <b>carving.</b> Borglum abandoned <b>the</b> project in 1925 (and later went on to begin Mount Rushmore). American sculptor Augustus Lukeman continued until 1928, when further work stopped for thirty years. In 1958, {{at the urging of}} Governor Marvin Griffin, the Georgia legislature approved a measure to purchase Stone Mountain for $1,125,000. In 1963, Walker Hancock was selected to complete <b>the</b> <b>carving,</b> and work began in 1964. <b>The</b> <b>carving</b> was completed by Roy Faulkner, who later operated a museum (now closed) on nearby Memorial Drive commemorating the carving's history. <b>The</b> <b>carving</b> was considered complete on March 3, 1972. The extensive entire surviving archive of the project to c 1928-9 is now at Emory University, the 'Finding Aid' provides {{a detailed description of the}} project to c. 1928 and index of the papers of all involved.|$|R
5|$|Ritual {{scarification}} in Nri {{was known}} as Ichi {{of which there are}} two styles; the Nri style, and the Agbaja style. In the Nri style, <b>the</b> <b>carved</b> line ran {{from the center of the}} forehead down to the chin. A second line ran across the face, from the right cheek to the left. This was repeated to obtain a pattern meant to imitate the rays of the sun. In the Agbaja style, circles and semicircular patterns are added to the initial incisions to represent the moon. These scarifications were given to the representatives of the eze Nri; the mbùríchi. The scarification's were Nri's way of honoring the sun that they worshiped and was a form of ritual purification.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{dates from}} the 14thcentury, although a number of changes have since been made, particularly a substantial 19th-century restoration by SirGeorge Gilbert Scott. The church and its octagonal tower are built in red sandstone. Features of the church's interior include the lierne-vaulted ceiling of the choir, <b>the</b> <b>carved</b> stone canopies of the sedilia in the chancel, and the intricately carved wooden canopies over the choirstalls together with the 20misericords {{at the back of}} the stalls. The church is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Macclesfield and the deanery of Nantwich.|$|E
5|$|The long gallery, {{along the}} north side, has a chimneypiece in {{coloured}} marbles with busts by Henry Weekes depicting Sir Randolph Crewe and Nathaniel Crew, 3rd Baron Crew, Bishop of Durham. The library, above <b>the</b> <b>carved</b> parlour, contains statuettes of book lovers by Philip and a frieze of scenes from literature by J. Mabey. The drawing room has a facsimile of the Jacobean ceiling, which had been recorded by architect William Burn. Identical in pattern to one at the Reindeer Inn in Banbury, of which the Victoria and Albert Museum has a plaster cast, it was presumably originally {{the work of the}} same craftsman. One of the state bedrooms has another survivor of the fire, a Jacobean stone fireplace with a plaster overmantel relief depicting Cain and Abel.|$|E

5|$|While {{working in}} the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo's {{interest}} in archaeology and old relics led him to reconstruct an armillary sphere from existing models {{as well as from}} ancient texts that could provide additional information. Shen used ancient mirrors while conducting his optics experiments. He observed ancient weaponry, describing the scaled sight devices on ancient crossbows and the ancients' production of swords with composite blades that had a midrib of wrought iron and low-carbon steel while having two sharp edges of high-carbon steel. Being a knowledgeable musician, Shen also suggested suspending an ancient bell by using a hollow handle. In his assessment of <b>the</b> <b>carved</b> reliefs of the ancient Zhuwei Tomb, Shen stated that the reliefs demonstrate genuine Han Dynasty (202 BC–220 AD) era clothing.|$|E
5|$|Around 1670, {{the church}} was refurbished, a gallery was built at {{the western end of}} the nave, and <b>the</b> <b>carved</b> reredos and a large wooden Royal coat of arms, now at the west end of the nave, were {{acquired}} at the same time. An inspection report {{at the end of the}} 18th century commented on the dirty transept walls, and the need to install the equivalent of a cattle grid to keep pigs out of the churchyard. Rich crimson hangings in the church had earlier attracted the attention of a thief. The increasing congregation led to the replacement of the pews and the construction of galleries down both sides of the building in 1829, but a more extensive rebuilding was undertaken in 1878–80, by James Piers St Aubyn. The galleries were removed and the two outer aisles were added during this period, a chapel was converted to a vestry and improvements were made to the Hastings Chapel. The cost of these works has been estimated as between £16,000 and more than £18,000. Later developments included the expenditure of £13,000 between 1963 and 1968 to combat deathwatch beetles found during rewiring, improvements to the heating system, and a rededication in 1974, the quincentenary of the church.|$|E
5|$|Either {{side of the}} Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which {{contains}} a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great Staircase {{to the east of}} the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. Rupert Gunnis attributed <b>the</b> <b>carved</b> marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Richard Westmacott.|$|E
