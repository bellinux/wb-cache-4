500|$|<b>The</b> <b>muffled</b> {{sound of}} the album's {{production}} has attracted criticism; Stevie Chick disparaged the lack of character in Ginn's bass-playing on [...] "My War" [...] {{when compared to the}} 1982 demo of the same song with Dukowski on bass. [...] Michael Azerrad praised the strength of the material while denigrating the [...] "frustrating lack of ensemble feel" [...] as the album was recorded without a full lineup. [...] Critic Clay Jarvis commended the album, emphasizing the risks taken on it and its influence, calling it [...] "more a test than an album", and saying, [...] "independent music is stronger because Black Flag formulated it". [...] John Dougan at AllMusic called the A-side of the album [...] "quite good", but described the B-side as [...] "self-indulgence masquerading as inspiration and about as much fun as wading through a tar pit". [...] Robert Christgau considered the B-side a [...] "waste".|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>muffles</b> of <b>the</b> {{concentration}} camp ovens were smaller that those for civil crematoria, because no {{space for a}} coffin was needed, which saved both space and fuel. Prüfer later designed ovens with muffles large enough for multiple bodies to be burned similtaneously. Later, in Topf & Söhne's instructions on using the ovens, they advised adding bodies to <b>the</b> <b>muffles</b> at 20 minute intervals as the previous body burned down. Bodies were often pushed in four, five or even six at once.|$|R
500|$|The {{next few}} loops feature a {{refrigerator}} {{hanging from the}} ceiling, leaking blood, <b>the</b> <b>muffled</b> sound of a hysterically crying baby can be heard from the refrigerator and it violently shakes and moves, implying that the baby is trapped inside. This happens several times, each time being more severe than the last. As it transitions, the radio issues a Swedish message referencing the 1938 radio drama The War of the Worlds. In the next loop, the lamps turn completely red, the player's vision blurs, and the character moves abnormally quickly, {{with a set of}} disturbing illusions. Eventually, the protagonist listens to a murder being committed in the bathroom through the bathroom peephole. After the audio ends, the bathroom door opens by itself and the player enters upon the fetus-like creature addressing the protagonist that ten months earlier, he lost his job and turned to alcoholism. His wife then landed a part-time cashier job in order to financially support the family, but the manager was sexually attracted to her, implying a motive for the familicide. The corridor then corrects itself and the protagonist eventually hears a voice uttering [...] "204863" [...] repeatedly and the player's perspective distorts, before the game displays a false crash message.|$|E
500|$|The Stukas, however, had {{numerous}} successes against Allied naval vessels {{and in particular}} the Royal Navy which posed a formidable threat to German naval and coastal operations. The heavy cruiser Suffolk was attacked on 17 April. Her stern was virtually destroyed but she limped back to Scapa Flow with 33 dead and 38 wounded crewmen. The light cruiser squadron consisting of the sister ships Curacoa and Curlew were subjected to lengthy attacks which badly damaged the former for one Ju 87 lost. A witness later said, [...] "they threatened to take our masthead with them in every screaming nerve-racking dive". The same fate nearly befell the sloop Black Swan. On the 27 April a bomb passed through the quarter deck, a wardroom, a water tank and 4-inch (10.2cm) magazine and out through the hull to explode in the fjord. <b>The</b> <b>muffled</b> explosion limited the damage to her hull. Black Swan fired 1,000 rounds but failed to shoot any of her attackers down. [...] was sunk on 30 April. The French large destroyer Bison was sunk along with [...] by Sturzkampfgeschwader 1 on 3 May 1940 during the evacuation from Namsos. Bisons forward magazine was hit, killing 108 of the crew. Afridi, which attempted to rescue Bisons survivors, was sunk with the loss of 63 sailors. 49 officers and men, 13 soldiers and 33 survivors from Bison were lost aboard Afridi. All ships were targeted. Armed trawlers were used under the German air umbrella in attempt to provide smaller targets. Such craft were not armoured or armed. The Ju 87's demonstrated this on 30 April when they sank the Jardine (452 tons) and Warwickshire (466 tons). On 15 May the Polish troopship Chrobry (11,442 tons) was sunk.|$|E

40|$|The lacquiring line of {{a bicycle}} factory has been fitted with energy {{efficient}} equipment. THe change was made from a hydrocarbon soluble primer to a water soluble primer, which, apart from obvious environmental benefits, has resulted in considerable lowering of the drying temperature and, hence, the energy consumption of the drying furnace. New energy efficient spraying cabins were installed. <b>The</b> <b>muffling</b> procedure was changed and <b>the</b> <b>muffling</b> furnace has been integrated with the drying tunnel in the priming section.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>muffle</b> furnace {{main purpose}} is to anneal the rough sponge iron powder transported through it, which is done by burning natural gas. Heat is absorbed by <b>the</b> <b>muffle</b> and is {{transferred}} to the bed of sponge iron powder. In {{order to reduce the}} consumptions of fossil fuel, some companies of the industry aims to exchange the natural gas in their muffle furnace’s burners to syngas, produced from biomass. This will however affect the performance of the furnace in the heating aspect. For this work, it is assumed that the effect will be negative. Thus the aim {{of this study is to}} investigate how to compensate the loss of effect from the burners, by examining which other parameters have influence on the furnace heating performance of the sponge iron powder transported through the furnace. The investigation is executed by simulating a 1 meter of the furnace in COMSOL multiphysics for 10 min, not including the combustion chambers. The investigated parameters are the packing degree of the powder, surface emissivity of <b>the</b> <b>muffle,</b> process gas velocity, conveyor belt velocity and the heat transfer rate coefficient to <b>muffle</b> from <b>the</b> combustion chambers. Alas, the process gas velocity and conveyor belt velocity only have minor influence on the final result, according to this simulation. However, the simulation exhibited that the surface emissivity of <b>the</b> <b>muffle</b> and <b>the</b> packing degree of the powder has great impact on the heating of the powder and could compensate some of the lost effect from the burners. This could be obtained by using an unpolished and oxidized muffle surface, and use densely packed powder sample...|$|R
