5|$|Prior to the Fire was {{released}} on October 20, 2009 in Canada, and on February 2, 2010 (the soonest possible date <b>Tee</b> Pee Records could give the band) in the United States. Priestess chose for an earlier release in Canada {{so that they could}} begin touring in support of the record at last. All CD pressings of the album contain 11 tracks, but with the deluxe edition from <b>Tee</b> Pee Records comes a code to obtain a 13-track edition from the Internet. It contains the original 11 tracks, plus two bonus tracks. (As the band are signed only to Indica Records in Canada, all deluxe editions from <b>Tee</b> Pee Records are only released outside of Canada.) Two deluxe editions were released by <b>Tee</b> Pee Records: both came with the code for the Internet download, and one came with an exclusive T-shirt as well.|$|E
5|$|After {{a safety}} is scored, {{the ball is}} put into play by a free kick. The team that was scored upon must kick the ball from their own 20-yard line and can punt, drop kick, or place kick the ball. In {{professional}} play, a kicking <b>tee</b> cannot be used – however, a <b>tee</b> {{can be used in}} high school or college football. Once the ball has been kicked, it can be caught and advanced by any member of the receiving team, and it can be recovered by the kicking team if the ball travels at least 10 yards and bounces at least once or a player of the receiving team touches the ball.|$|E
50|$|A {{result of}} the 20-Year Tune Up was the {{addition}} of a new set of <b>tees,</b> the green <b>tees.</b> The green <b>tees</b> are now set up between the blue <b>tees</b> and white <b>tees.</b>|$|R

5000|$|... 11-4 - <b>Teeing</b> {{off from}} outside the <b>teeing</b> ground is not a penalty in match play, but the {{opponent}} may require the stroke be cancelled and replayed from within the <b>teeing</b> ground. <b>Teeing</b> off {{from outside the}} <b>teeing</b> ground is a two-stroke penalty in stroke play and a ball must then be played from the <b>teeing</b> area. The stroke made from outside the <b>teeing</b> area and subsequent strokes made at that ball do not count.|$|R
5|$|Between 2011–2015, Thistle's mascot was Jaggy MacBee, a large {{bumble bee}} {{that had been}} {{introduced}} {{as part of the}} clubs sponsorship with MacB Water. Before that, Thistle used a brightly coloured toucan called Pee <b>Tee</b> as its official mascot.|$|E
5|$|From the Ages is {{the third}} {{full-length}} studio album by American rock band Earthless. It was released on October 8, 2013 by <b>Tee</b> Pee Records. It had been six years since the band’s last full-length studio album, Rhythms from a Cosmic Sky, as all three members of Earthless were pre-occupied with other matters, including other bands.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Double <b>Tee</b> Promotions {{acquired}} {{control of}} Roseland's operations. In December 1995, The Oregonian {{reported that the}} company and its president, David Leiken, would be purchasing and renovating the building over several months. Leiken founded Double <b>Tee,</b> which produces events throughout the Pacific Northwest and continues to manage Roseland, in 1972. The project, which included purchase of the building, new lounges and restrooms, and a ventilation system, was estimated to cost between $1.75million and $2million. The size of the street-level floor would also increased to accommodate an additional 350–440 guests, replacing a small club called the Garden. The renovation project ended in 1997; Leiken updated the building's facade and opened a nightclub and sports bar on the lower level. Roseland remained open during the renovation, which reportedly cost around $2.5million.|$|E

5000|$|The {{course is}} a par 71, at a length of 6,528 from the black <b>tees,</b> 6,219 from the blue <b>tees,</b> 5,718 yards from the white <b>tees,</b> and 5,459 yards from the red <b>tees.</b> The men's slope ratings are 72.3/134, 70.8/129 and 68.5/124 for the black, blue, and white <b>tees,</b> respectively.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tees</b> {{are also}} used to provide a course rating from which scores can be posted to {{calculate}} a handicap, with longer <b>tees</b> providing a higher rating. Thus, theoretically a higher score can be posted from the longer <b>tees</b> without affecting the handicap. Not all <b>tees</b> will specify a rating {{for both men and}} women. For example, red <b>tees</b> will typically specify a rating for women, but not for men, and vice versa for championship <b>tees.</b>|$|R
5|$|In April 1963, the SCLC began a {{campaign}} against racial segregation and economic injustice in Birmingham, Alabama. The campaign used nonviolent but intentionally confrontational tactics, developed in part by Rev. Wyatt <b>Tee</b> Walker. Black people in Birmingham, organizing with the SCLC, occupied public spaces with marches and sit-ins, openly violating laws that they considered unjust.|$|E

5|$|On a kickoff, {{the ball}} is placed at the 35-yard line of the kicking team in {{professional}} and college play and at the 40-yard line in high school play. The ball may be drop-kicked or place-kicked. If a place kick is chosen, the ball can {{be placed on the}} ground or on a <b>tee,</b> and a holder may be used in either case. On a safety kick, the kicking team kicks the ball from their own 20-yard line. They can punt, drop-kick or place-kick the ball, but a <b>tee</b> may not be used in professional play. Any member of the receiving team may catch or advance the ball, and the ball may be recovered by the kicking team once it has gone at least ten yards and has touched the ground or has been touched by any member of the receiving team.|$|E

5|$|Since 1963, {{the custom}} in most {{years has been}} to start the tournament with an honorary opening <b>tee</b> shot at the first hole, {{typically}} {{by one or more}} legendary players. The original honorary starters were Jock Hutchison and Fred McLeod; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening <b>tee</b> shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.|$|E
5|$|A {{consequence}} of his perfectionism {{is that some}} artists who initially sign deals with Dr.Dre's Aftermath label never release albums. In 2001, Aftermath released the soundtrack to the movie The Wash, featuring a number of Aftermath acts such as Shaunta, Daks, Joe Beast and Toi. To date, none have released full-length albums on Aftermath and have apparently ended their relationships with the label and Dr.Dre. Other noteworthy acts to leave Aftermath without releasing albums include King <b>Tee,</b> 2001 vocalist Hittman, Joell Ortiz, Raekwon and Rakim.|$|E

5|$|Following the cut, an {{additional}} 36 holes are played {{over the final}} two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a sudden-death playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains. Adopted in 1976, the sudden-death playoff was originally formatted to start on the first hole, but was not needed {{for the first three}} years. It was changed for 1979 to the inward (final) nine holes, starting at the tenth <b>tee,</b> where the television coverage began. First employed that same year, the Masters' first sudden-death playoff ended on the eleventh green. The current arrangement, beginning at the 18th <b>tee,</b> was amended for 2004 and first used the following year. Through 2017, the eleven sudden-death playoffs have yet to advance past the second extra hole. Earlier playoffs were 18 holes on the following day, except for the first in 1935, which was 36 holes; the last 18-hole playoff was in 1970, and none of the full-round playoffs went to additional holes.|$|E

5|$|Ripken {{has made}} {{donations}} to many various charitable causes, including donations supporting research on Lou Gehrig's disease. After he broke Gehrig's record, the Orioles, along with private donors, created the Cal Ripken/Lou Gehrig Fund for Neuromuscular Research at Johns Hopkins University. Along {{with his brother}} Billy, he formed the Cal Ripken Sr., Foundation in 2001 to give underprivileged children the opportunity to attend baseball camps {{around the country and}} learn the game. The Foundation is a branch of Ripken Baseball. In addition to controlling these camps and Ripken's minor league teams, Ripken Baseball operates for-profit camps and designs ballfields for youth, college, and professional teams. He gives speeches about his time in baseball and some of the lessons he has learned. Between 2001 and 2004, inclusive, Ripken served as commissioner of the White House <b>Tee</b> Ball Initiative of President George W.

5|$|The fair catch kick rule states that, after {{a player}} has {{successfully}} made a fair catch or {{has been awarded}} a fair catch (as {{the result of a}} penalty such as kick catch interference), their team can attempt a kick from the spot of the catch; the NFHS also allows a kick to be made if the down following the fair catch or awarded fair catch has to be replayed. Prior to the kick, the opposing team must be lined up at least ten yards beyond the spot of the ball. The kick itself can be either a place kick or drop kick; a kicking <b>tee</b> cannot be used at the professional level, but use of a <b>tee</b> up to two inches in height is permitted at the high school level. Like other field goal attempts, the kicking team is awarded three points if the kick goes above the crossbar and between the goalposts of the opposing team's goal and did not touch a player of the offensive team after the kick. If the attempt fails, the opposing team is awarded control of the ball from the spot of the kick. The opposing team can also return the kick if it does not go out of bounds.|$|E
