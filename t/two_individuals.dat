5|$|Solitary animals {{defend a}} {{territory}} and avoid social {{interactions with the}} members of its species, except during breeding season. This is to avoid resource competition, as <b>two</b> <b>individuals</b> of the same species would occupy the same niche, and to prevent depletion of food. A solitary animal, while foraging, can also be less conspicuous to predators or prey.|$|E
5|$|Triadic joint {{attention}} {{is the highest}} level of joint attention and involves <b>two</b> <b>individuals</b> looking at an object. Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and realize that {{there is an element of}} shared attention. For an instance of social engagement to count as triadic joint attention it requires at least <b>two</b> <b>individuals</b> attending to an object or focusing their attention on each other. Additionally, the individual must display awareness that focus is shared between himself or herself and another individual.

5|$|In glomeromycetes (formerly zygomycetes), haploid hyphae of <b>two</b> <b>individuals</b> fuse, {{forming a}} gametangium, a {{specialized}} cell structure {{that becomes a}} fertile gamete-producing cell. The gametangium develops into a zygospore, a thick-walled spore formed by the union of gametes. When the zygospore germinates, it undergoes meiosis, generating new haploid hyphae, which may then form asexual sporangiospores. These sporangiospores allow the fungus to rapidly disperse and germinate into new genetically identical haploid fungal mycelia.|$|E

Less common were the genera Baetis and Ephemerella (9 individuals each), Acroneuria (6 individuals), Cheumatopsyche and Rhyacophila (4 individuals each), and Simulium (3 individuals). There were four genera with <b>two</b> <b>individuals</b> each and 13 genera and one order with one individual each.|$|E

Damage was greatest around the Chiapas capital of Tuxtla Gutiérrez, where over 9,000houses were affected. The rainfall caused mudslides across the country, hospitalizing <b>two</b> <b>individuals</b> in central Hidalgo. The flooding also caused severe crop damage along Larry's path. Strong wind gusts caused outages to telephone and power services. In all, Larry caused five deaths and $53.6million in damage (2003USD, $59million 2005USD).|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{took one}} {{life in the}} state and indirectly contributed to two additional deaths. In Daytona Beach, a tree struck a parked vehicle, killing a person inside.

Forty-six people were killed in the Philippines: fatalities included <b>two</b> <b>individuals</b> who drowned when a river overflowed its banks in the Zambales province; a 24-year-old man electrocuted in Manila; a man who became entrapped in a vehicle; three people caught in a landslide; three civilians and a soldier swept down a torrential river; and ten fisherman aboard a stricken ship.|$|E

5|$|Although {{romantic love}} was not discouraged, marriages were {{arranged}} as agreements and bonds formed between two clans (with property {{as the chief}} concern), not necessarily <b>two</b> <b>individuals.</b> A father's input on who his sons and daughters should marry carried more weight than the mother, although a grandfather could override a father's decision. Once a couple had married, the new wife was obligated to visit the family temple so she could {{become part of the}} husband's clan and be properly worshipped by her descendants after death. However, she retained her natal surname. The vast majority of people during Han practiced monogamy, although wealthy officials and nobles could afford to support one or many concubines in addition to their legal wife.|$|E
5|$|Greg Paul (1988) {{proposed}} that the horns were butting weapons and that the small orbita would have minimized the possibility of hurting the eyes while fighting. Gerardo Mazzetta and colleagues (1998) suggested that Carnotaurus used its horns in a way similar to rams. They calculated that the neck musculature {{was strong enough to}} absorb the force of <b>two</b> <b>individuals</b> colliding with their heads frontally at a speed of 5.7m/s each. Fernando Novas (2009) interpreted several skeletal features as adaptations for delivering blows with the head. He suggested that the shortness of the skull might have made head movements quicker by reducing the moment of inertia, while the muscular neck would have allowed strong head blows. He also noted an enhanced rigidity and strength of the spinal column that may have evolved to withstand shocks conducted by the head and neck.|$|E
5|$|In the Late Classic {{there appears}} to have been greater public access to the acropolis, with {{stairways}} communicating between the various terraces leading up to the south range. During the Terminal Classic, these stairways were filled in, as were many of the access doorways to the acropolis itself, with some buildings being sealed completely. This closing of public access to the palace reflects the greater political instability engulfing the entire Petén region at this time. The acropolis complex was abandoned by the city's elite in the Terminal Classic, a time when most of the city centre was also deserted by its residents. Many flint projectile points were recovered from the south terraces of the acropolis, this combined with the remains of <b>two</b> <b>individuals</b> very near the surface indicates that a violent confrontation took place around the time that the city was abandoned.|$|E
