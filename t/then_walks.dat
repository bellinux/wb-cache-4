5|$|A female P. labiata {{that sees}} a male may {{approach}} slowly or wait. The male <b>then</b> <b>walks</b> with erect and displaying by waving {{his legs and}} palps. If the female does not run away, she gives a propulsive display first.

P. labiata typically copulates for about 100seconds, while other genera can take several minutes or even several hours.|$|E
