2500|$|One more {{contrast}} to Gestalt psychological emphasis in neural binding {{was brought up}} by L. Chen. Chen asserts that the local-global idea of Gestalt does not suffice in explaining neural processing. Instead, Chen uses the idea that perception depends on [...] "topological invariants that describe the geometrical potentiality of the entire stimulus configuration". <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>here</b> is that looking at a certain object creates a stimulus which in turn fires a constellation of that object, and then the object becomes recognized.|$|E

2500|$|Karl Popper {{argues that}} a {{preference}} for simple theories need not appeal to practical or aesthetic considerations.

2500|$|Though Sting {{eventually}} won the tournament, Luger was {{the only}} participant to go undefeated (Sting got pinfall victories over Muta and Flair, giving him the most points to win the tournament). This elevated Sting {{to the status of}} No.1 contender for Flair's world title. With Sting and Flair set to square off at WrestleWar in February, Luger was booked to defend the U.S. Title against [...] "Dr. Death" [...] Steve Williams on the card. A legitimate injury to Sting, however, caused the entire booking of the card to get changed. Luger was elevated to face Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. An injured Sting appeared in Luger's corner during the match, eventually being attacked by Ole and Arn Anderson. When Luger left the ring to help Sting he was counted out, giving the match to Flair. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>here</b> was to build Luger up as a [...] "changed man" [...] that had [...] "gained self-respect" [...] by saving Sting. In the final match of the feud, a few months later at the Capital Combat event in Washington, DC, Luger won by disqualification against Flair in a steel cage match when the cage rose up from the ground and outside interference marred the match.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea,</b> <b>here,</b> {{is that a}} truth's {{invariance}} {{makes it}} genuinely indiscernible: because a truth is everywhere and always the case, it passes unnoticed {{unless there is a}} rupture in the laws of being and appearance, during which the truth in question becomes, but only for a passing moment, discernible. Such a rupture is what Badiou calls an event, according to a theory originally worked out in Being and Event and fleshed out in important ways in Logics of Worlds. The individual who chances to witness such an event, if he is faithful to what he has glimpsed, can then introduce the truth by naming it into worldly situations. For Badiou, it is by positioning oneself to the truth of an event that a human animal becomes a subject; subjectivity is not an inherent human trait. According to a process or procedure that subsequently unfolds only if those who subject themselves to the glimpsed truth continue to be faithful in the work of announcing the truth in question, genuine knowledge is produced (knowledge often appears in Badiou's work under the title of the [...] "veridical"). While such knowledge is produced {{in the process of being}} faithful to a truth event, it should be noted that, for Badiou, knowledge, in the figure of the encyclopedia, always remains fragile, subject to what may yet be produced as faithful subjects of the event produce further knowledge. According to Badiou, truth procedures proceed to infinity, such that faith (fidelity) outstrips knowledge. (Badiou, following both Lacan and Heidegger, distances truth from knowledge.) The dominating ideology of the day, which Badiou terms [...] "democratic materialism," [...] denies the existence of truth and only recognizes [...] "bodies" [...] and [...] "languages." [...] Badiou proposes a turn towards the [...] "materialist dialectic," [...] which recognizes that there are only bodies and languages, except there are also truths.|$|E

60|$|If the propositions of this Discourse are tenable, the “state of {{progressive}} collapse” is precisely that {{state in which}} alone we are warranted in considering All Things; and, with due humility, let me here confess that, for my part, I am {{at a loss to}} conceive how any other understanding of the existing condition of affairs, could ever have made its way into the human brain. “The tendency to collapse” and “the attraction of gravitation” are convertible phrases. In using either, we speak of the rëaction of the First Act. Never was necessity less obvious than that of supposing Matter imbued with an ineradicable quality forming part of its material nature—a quality, or instinct, forever inseparable from it, and by dint of which inalienable principle every atom is perpetually impelled to seek its fellow-atom. Never was necessity less obvious than that of entertaining this unphilosophical idea. Going boldly behind the vulgar thought, we have to conceive, metaphysically, that the gravitating principle appertains to Matter temporarily—only while diffused—only while existing as Many instead of as One—appertains to it by virtue of its state of irradiation alone—appertains, in a word, altogether to its condition, and not in the slighest degree to itself. In this view, when the irradiation shall have returned into its source—when the rëaction shall be completed—the gravitating principle will no longer exist. And, in fact, astronomers, without at any time reaching <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>here</b> suggested, seem to have been approximating it, in the assertion that “if there were but one body in the Universe, {{it would be impossible to}} understand how the principle, Gravity, could obtain:”—that is to say, from a consideration of Matter as they find it, they reach a conclusion at which I deductively arrive. That so pregnant a suggestion as the one just quoted should have been permitted to remain so long unfruitful, is, nevertheless, a mystery which I find it difficult to fathom.|$|E
6000|$|I {{came near}} letting this go without telling you of one curious {{incident}} {{of the affair}} between the captain and his men. Before the men returned to the ship they came with their spokesman {{to say good-bye to}} Aristides and me, and he remarked casually that it was just as well, maybe, to be going back, because, for one thing, they would know then whether it was real or not. I asked him what he meant, and he said, [...] "Well, you know, some of the mates think it's a dream here, or it's {{too good to be true}}. As far forth as I go, I'd be willing to have it a dream that I didn't ever have to wake up from. It ain't any too good to be true for me. Anyway, I'm going to get back somehow, and give it another chance to be a fact." [...] Wasn't that charming? It had a real touch of poetry in it, but it was prose that followed. I couldn't help asking him whether there had been nothing to mar the pleasure of their stay in Altruria, and he answered: [...] "Well, I don't know as you could rightly say mar; it hadn't ought to have. You see, it was like this. You see, some of the mates wanted to lay off and have a regular bange, but that don't seem to be <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>here.</b> After we had been ashore a day or two they set us to work at different jobs, or wanted to.

Then they called a halt, and tackled one of your head men here that could speak some English. He didn't answer them right off the reel, but he got out his English Testament and he read 'em a verse that said, 'For even when we were with you this we commanded you, that if any one would not work neither should he eat.' That kind of fetched 'em, and after that there wa'n't any sojerin', well not to speak of. They saw he meant business.
