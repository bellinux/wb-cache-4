5|$|On both trains, the {{locomotive}} faces towards Hogsmeade station; {{it is not}} possible for <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> to face King's Cross. The Hogwarts Express enters King's Cross in reverse but forwards at Hogsmeade; the train departs King's Cross forwards and in reverse at Hogsmeade. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> are only designed to be seen from one side as {{the locomotive}}s' false driving wheels and specific detailing only exist on one side.|$|E
5|$|The Duke of Wellington {{felt that}} the {{remainder}} of the day's events should be cancelled following the accident at Parkside, and proposed to return to Liverpool. However, a large crowd had gathered in Manchester to see <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> arrive, and was beginning to become unruly. Wellington was persuaded to continue to Manchester. By the time <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> reached the outskirts of Manchester the crowd had become hostile and was spilling onto the tracks. With local authorities unable to clear the tracks, <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> were obliged to drive at low speed into the crowd, using their own momentum to push people out of the way. Eventually they arrived at Liverpool Road railway station in Manchester to be met by a hostile crowd, who waved banners and flags against the Duke and pelted him with vegetables. Wellington refused to get off the train, and ordered that <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> return to Liverpool. Mechanical failures and an inability to turn the locomotives meant that most of <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> were unable to leave Manchester. While the Duke of Wellington's train left successfully, only three of the remaining seven locomotives were usable. These three locomotives slowly hauled a single long train of 24 carriages back to Liverpool, eventually arriving 6 hours late after having been pelted with objects thrown from bridges by the drunken crowds lining the track.|$|E

5|$|The Giant Dipper {{currently}} operates {{with two}} trains with six cars per train. Riders are arranged two across in two rows {{for a total}} of 24 riders per train. <b>The</b> <b>trains</b> were built by Dana Morgan from D.H. Morgan Manufacturing. When the Giant Dipper opened, it ran with three trains, each with ten cars. Over time, <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> have been redesigned several times with changes to the restraint system. However, they are almost unchanged since they opened. <b>The</b> <b>trains</b> have changed colors several times since the ride opened.|$|E
5|$|The first {{train was}} {{delivered}} on 22 October and {{was put into}} use on the Sørland Line from 1 November. Scheduled travel time was reduced by 40 minutes to 3 hours and 40 minutes. In December, <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> had problems with the pantographs not working correctly in cold weather, causing <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> to lose power and be several hours delayed. NSB stated that a contributing cause was the previous year's mild winter, which {{made it impossible to}} test <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> in extreme weather. After {{two and a half months}} of operation on the Sørland Line, every other train was at least 5 minutes late and every tenth train at least 20 minutes late. <b>The</b> <b>trains</b> also caused travel sickness, also among employees, particularly on the section from Kristiansand to Bø. NSB stated that this had also occurred on the old trains and that it was reports of the number of people affected were exaggerated.|$|E
5|$|The ride {{originally}} operated {{with three}} trains designed by Premier Rides. Each one consisted of six cars {{for a total}} capacity of thirty-six. <b>The</b> <b>trains</b> were shortened to five cars before the 2006 season. After the ride's first major incident, <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> were replaced altogether with lighter models before the ride reopened the following season. The loop was also removed during this time.|$|E
50|$|Children {{who were}} on a ship that crashed into an iceberg (possibly Titanic) get on <b>the</b> <b>train</b> at Aquila, {{suggesting}} that <b>the</b> <b>train</b> is transporting its passengers to <b>the</b> afterlife. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> arrives at <b>the</b> Southern Cross {{and all the other}} passengers get off <b>the</b> <b>train,</b> leaving only Giovanni and Campanella in <b>the</b> <b>train.</b> Giovanni promises Campanella they will go on together, forever, but as <b>the</b> <b>train</b> approaches <b>the</b> Coalsack, Campanella disappears, leaving Giovanni behind.|$|R
50|$|As <b>the</b> <b>train</b> {{travels through}} <b>the</b> country, {{passenger}} Han (Richard Ng) sneaks {{back and forth}} on roof of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> between his fat wife (Lydia Shum) and his beautiful mistress.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>trains</b> {{were put}} back into service on 13 July. <b>The</b> <b>trains</b> were only allowed {{to operate at}} {{conventional}} speeds and {{had to go through}} a weekly inspection. At the same time, NSB removed the surcharge on the Signatur services. NSB stated that they were considering revocation the purchase of the four trains which were still to be delivered. In addition to problems with axles, there were also issues with the braking and air conditioning systems. In mid-August, the tilting mechanism was disabled on all <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> because of a fault in a bearing in the connection between the bogie and the body which allowed for a movement of several millimetres (at least 0.1 in). In late August, problems occurred with the braking system causing <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> to automatically brake even when not receiving such signals from the automatic train stop system.|$|E

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the ride, the linear induction motors propel <b>the</b> <b>train</b> forward out of the station during its first launch at 50 mi/h km/h, which carries <b>the</b> <b>train</b> approximately halfway up the front tower. After coming to a stop, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> falls and enters the LIM section again, where <b>the</b> <b>train</b> is accelerated during its second launch to 63 mi/h km/h in the backward direction so that <b>the</b> <b>train</b> climbs halfway up the rear tower. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> then stops and drops forward before re-entering the LIM section where additional thrust is added as <b>the</b> <b>train</b> gains to 69 mi/h km/h during its third launch, causing <b>the</b> <b>train</b> to reach its highest point on the front tower. Stopping and reversing, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> drops and re-enters the LIM section where the LIM launches <b>the</b> <b>train</b> for <b>the</b> fourth time, making <b>the</b> <b>train</b> reach a maximum speed of 72 mi/h km/h to travel a maximum of 206 ft up the rear tower. With the one more final pass forward through the LIM section, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> goes up <b>the</b> front spike once more before <b>the</b> <b>train</b> reverses. As it travels back toward the station, the brakes are applied and it stops within the station platform. Unlike other Inverted roller coasters, there is no floor in the loading station that drops out underneath <b>the</b> <b>train.</b> Riders must climb into their seats when loading.|$|R

5|$|By 2010, B {{employed}} twelve engineers, twelve draftsmen and two draftswomen. The {{company has}} made other {{contributions to the}} roller coaster industry. The company built <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> for the Psyclone, a now-demolished wooden roller coaster at Six Flags Magic Mountain. <b>The</b> <b>trains</b> were later used on the park's Colossus wooden roller coaster (until it was refurbished by Rocky Mountain Construction), but were only used during October each year. <b>The</b> <b>trains</b> faced backward and usually raced against trains on the second track, which ran forward. In 2013, B supplied new trains for Steel Dragon 2000, built by D. H. Morgan Manufacturing in 2000. As of 2012, Bolliger & Mabillard has 85 operating roller coasters worldwide, twenty-two of which are listed among the Amusement Today Golden Ticket Awards Top 50 Steel Coasters List for 2012, and five are in the top 10. The company has built more roller coasters than any other manufacturer on the list.|$|E
5|$|Eight 6-car trains {{supplied}} by CAF Beasain were imported from Spain. CAF held 5% {{equity in the}} DAME project, and Reliance Infrastructure held the remaining 95% before DMRC took over the operations. <b>The</b> <b>trains</b> on this line are of a premium standard compared to the existing metro trains and have in-built noise reduction and padded fabric seats. The coaches are equipped with LCD screens for entertainment of the passengers and also provide flight information for convenience of air travellers. <b>The</b> <b>trains</b> are fitted with an event recorder which can withstand high levels of temperature and impact and the wheels have flange lubrication system for less noise and better riding comfort.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, {{propulsion}} coils on the guideway {{are used}} to exert a force on the magnets in <b>the</b> <b>train</b> and make <b>the</b> <b>train</b> move forward. <b>The</b> propulsion coils that exert a force on <b>the</b> <b>train</b> are effectively a linear motor: an alternating current flowing through the coils generates a continuously varying magnetic field that moves forward along the track. The frequency of the alternating current is synchronized to match the speed of <b>the</b> <b>train.</b> <b>The</b> offset between the field exerted by magnets on <b>the</b> <b>train</b> and <b>the</b> applied field creates a force moving <b>the</b> <b>train</b> forward.|$|R
50|$|Station timing, {{a method}} of evening out trains, has been imposed on certain {{stations}} with interlocking (or home) signals. These signals turn to a red aspect as a train passes it, and is forced red for a variable amount of time. This time depends on the distance between <b>the</b> last <b>train</b> that passed <b>the</b> signal, and <b>the</b> <b>train</b> that comes after <b>the</b> next <b>train.</b> This system is computerized, and can accurately calculate the relative distances. If <b>the</b> next <b>train</b> is closer to <b>the</b> <b>train</b> before than <b>the</b> <b>train</b> after, then <b>the</b> signal will hold <b>the</b> <b>train</b> at <b>the</b> station. If <b>the</b> next <b>train</b> is closer to <b>the</b> <b>train</b> after it than <b>the</b> <b>train</b> before it, then the signal will clear.|$|R

The service was a great success, with over 9,000 people travelling on <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> and large numbers of people travelling to the area to watch <b>the</b> <b>trains.</b> The success prompted LT to repeat the Steam on the Met event annually until 2000, although often running to Amersham rather than Chesham.|$|E
500|$|The {{roller coaster}} begins {{the same way}} that the XT 150 model does. After <b>the</b> <b>train</b> departs from <b>the</b> station, it {{immediately}} begins to climb the vertical (90 degree) lift hill. Upon reaching the top of <b>the</b> lift, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> turns 45 degrees backwards putting <b>the</b> <b>train</b> and its riders in an upside down position. After, as <b>the</b> <b>train</b> exits <b>the</b> lift, it goes through an heartline roll. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> enters <b>the</b> first drop where it reaches its maximum speed of [...] before traversing a tight left overbanked turn. After <b>the</b> turn, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> goes over <b>the</b> only camelback hill followed by another left overbanked turn. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> then follows a flat section of track before going down a small drop leading into the station and back up the lift where <b>the</b> <b>train</b> stops. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> is then lowered back down to the station where the next riders board the ride.|$|R
50|$|After departing <b>the</b> station, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> {{crossed a}} {{transfer}} track and traveled down a small dip, then completed a 180-degree {{turn to the}} left onto the lift hill. After a 173 ft climb, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> dropped 155 ft to the left, reaching {{a top speed of}} 68 mi/h km/h. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> then traveled through its first inversion, a single vertical loop. After exiting <b>the</b> loop, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> turned to <b>the</b> left, and traveled through a double-loop. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> then traveled upward with a left turn onto the mid-course brake run. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> came to a complete stop for 2 seconds. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> then dropped down into a batwing element. After <b>the</b> batwing, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> made a right turn, where riders' pictures are taken. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> then proceeded to enter the double corkscrew, then completed a 180-degree turn to the left onto the final brake run back into the station.|$|R

5|$|In March 1997, NSB {{announced}} that they had plans to privatize {{the operations of the}} line from 1998. The responsibility for setting the schedule, selling tickets and marketing was transferred to Flåm Utvikling, a newly established company that NSB owned 49 percent of, and Aurland Ressursutvikling 51 percent. The latter was owned by Aurland Municipality, the Industrial Development Corporation of Norway and Aurland Sparebank, a local bank. Flåm Utvikling also took over responsibility for other tourism-related activities in Flåm, such as port facilities. NSB would still operate <b>the</b> <b>trains,</b> and Flåm Utvikling would pay NSB the cost of running <b>the</b> <b>trains,</b> but keep the profits from the ticket sales. The Norwegian National Rail Administration, which had been established in 1996 and had taken over the responsibility for infrastructure, retained ownership of the line itself. Flåm Utvikling also started building a cruise ship terminal at Flåm, so tourists could walk ashore and directly to <b>the</b> <b>trains.</b>|$|E
