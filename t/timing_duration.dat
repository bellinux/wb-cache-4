40|$|Time is a {{ubiquitous}} {{but often}} omitted variable in career selection decisions. This study investigates {{the impact of}} temporal elements on career selection decisions, thus advancing our understanding of both career decision making {{and the impact of}} timing on decision making. We investigate the influence of <b>timing</b> and <b>duration</b> of experience with career options on career selection decisions in an archival study using medical residents’ rotation schedules. We also investigate factors that mitigate the influence of timing on career selection decisions by examining the interaction of <b>timing</b> with the <b>duration</b> of experience and the diversity of options that an individual experiences. Conditional logit results indicate that decisions often based on career and individual attributes are significantly influenced by the <b>timing</b> and <b>duration</b> of options even when controlling for option attributes. Additionally, significant interactions between timing and diversity of experience and <b>timing</b> and <b>duration</b> of experience revealed boundary conditions for timing. Individuals were more likely to select later-appearing career options when they appeared for a greater duration or when they experienced a greater diversity of options in their schedule. Results illustrate that schedules over which individuals have no control can influence consequential decisions.

50|$|The valves {{within an}} {{internal}} combustion engine are used to control {{the flow of the}} intake and exhaust gases {{into and out of the}} combustion chamber. The <b>timing,</b> <b>duration</b> and lift of these valve events has a significant impact on engine performance. Without variable valve timing or variable valve lift, the valve timing must be the same for all engine speeds and conditions, therefore compromises are necessary. An engine equipped with a variable valve timing actuation system is freed from this constraint, allowing performance to be improved over the engine operating range.|$|E
50|$|A {{different}} set of signaling cascades respond to stimulus <b>timing</b> <b>duration</b> and dynamics. Adaptive signaling pathways, for instance, adjust in accordance to {{the current level of}} the projected stimulus and display activity only when these levels change as opposed to responding to absolute levels of the input. Stimulus dynamics also can trigger activity; treating PC12 cells with epidermal growth factor (inducing a transient profile of ERK activity) leads to cellular proliferation whereas introduction of nerve growth factor (inducing a sustained profile of ERK activity) is associated with a different cellular decision whereby the PC12 cells differentiate into neuron-like cells. This discovery was guided pharmacologically but the finding was replicated utilizing optogenetic inputs instead. This ability to optogenetically control signals for various time durations is being explored to elucidate various cell signaling pathways where there is not a strong enough understanding to utilize either drug/genetic manipulation.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims Our {{knowledge}} about the influences of environmental factors on tree growth is principally based {{on the study of}} dominant trees. However, tree social status may influence intra-annual dynamics of growth, leading to differential responses to environmental conditions. The aim was to determine whether within-stand differences in stem diameters of trees belonging to different crown classes resulted from variations in the length of the growing period or in the rate of cell production. Methods Cambial activity was monitored weekly in 2006 for three crown classes in a 40 -year-old silver-fir (Abies alba) plantation near Nancy (France). <b>Timings,</b> <b>duration</b> and rate of tracheid production were assessed from anatomical observations of the developing xylem. Key Results Cambial activity started earlier, stopped later and lasted longer in dominant trees than in intermediate and suppressed ones. The onset of cambial activity was estimated to have taken 3 weeks to spread to 90 % of the trees in the stand, while the cessation needed 6 weeks. Cambial activity was more intense in dominant trees than in intermediate and suppressed ones. It was estimated that about 75 % of tree-ring width variability was attributable to the rate of cell production and only 25 % to its duration. Moreover, growth duration was correlated to tree height, while growth rate was better correlated to crown area. Conclusions These results show that, in a closed conifer forest, stem diameter variations resulted principally from differences in the rate of xylem cell production rather than in its duration. Tree size interacts with environmental factors to control the <b>timings,</b> <b>duration</b> and rate of cambial activity through functional processes involving source-sink relationships principally, but also hormonal controls...|$|R

50|$|Important themes {{include the}} rapid {{industrialization}} and growing power of Britain, Europe and, {{later in the}} period, the United States and Japan. This led to imperialist and colonialist competitions for influence and power throughout the world, most famously, the Scramble for Africa in the 1880s and 1890s. The reverberations are still widespread and consequential in the 21st-century. Britain established an informal economic network that, combined with its colonies and its Royal Navy, made it the hegemonic nation until its power was challenged by Germany. It was a peaceful century, with no wars between the great powers, apart from the 1854-1871 interval, and some small wars between Russia and the Ottoman Empire. After 1900 there were a series of wars in the Balkan region, which exploded out of control into World War I (1914-18)—a massively devastating event that was unexpected in its <b>timing,</b> <b>duration,</b> casualties, and long-term impact.|$|E

50|$|The {{large body}} size (see also Bergmann's rule) and {{distribution}} of Steller's sea eagle suggests it is a glacial relict, meaning it evolved in a narrow subarctic zone of the northeasternmost Asian coasts, which shifted its latitude according to ice age cycles, and never occurred anywhere else. This bird nests in two habitats: along sea coasts and alongside large rivers with mature trees. They nest on large, rocky outcroppings or at the tops of large trees. Usually, areas with large Erman's birches (Betula ermanii) and floodplain forests of larches, alders, willows and poplar {{seem to be the}} preferred nesting spots. Some eagles, especially those that nest in sea coast, may not migrate. The <b>timing,</b> <b>duration,</b> and extent of migration depends on ice conditions and food availability. On Kamchatka, eagles overwinter in forests and river valleys near the coast, but are irregularly distributed over the peninsula. Most wintering birds there appear to be residential adults. Steller's sea eagles that do migrate fly down to winter in rivers and wetlands in Japan, but will occasionally move to mountainous inland areas as opposed to the sea coast. Each winter, drifting ice on the Sea of Okhotsk drives thousands of eagles south. Ice reaches Hokkaido in late January. Eagle numbers peak in the Nemuro Strait in late February. On Hokkaido, eagles concentrate in coastal areas and on lakes near the coast, along with substantial numbers of white-tailed eagles. Eagles depart between late March and late April, adults typically leaving before immatures. Migrants tend to follow sea coasts and are usually observed flying singly. In groups, migrants are typically observed flying 100 - 200 m apart. On Kamchatka, most migrants are birds in transitional plumages. They are also occasionally seen flying over the northern ocean or perching on sea ice during the winter.|$|E

50|$|VTEC, the {{original}} Honda variable valve control system, originated from REV (Revolution-modulated valve control) introduced on the CBR400 in 1983 known as HYPER VTEC. In the regular four-stroke automobile engine, the {{intake and exhaust}} valves are actuated by lobes on a camshaft. The shape of the lobes determines the <b>timing,</b> lift and <b>duration</b> of each valve. Timing refers to an angle measurement of when a valve is opened or closed {{with respect to the}} piston position (BTDC or ATDC). Lift refers to how much the valve is opened. Duration refers to how long the valve is kept open. Due to the behavior of the working fluid (air and fuel mixture) before and after combustion, which have physical limitations on their flow, as well as their interaction with the ignition spark, the optimal valve <b>timing,</b> lift and <b>duration</b> settings under low RPM engine operations are very different from those under high RPM. Optimal low RPM valve <b>timing</b> lift and <b>duration</b> settings would result in insufficient filling of the cylinder with fuel and air at high RPM, thus greatly limiting engine power output. Conversely, optimal high RPM valve <b>timing</b> lift and <b>duration</b> settings would result in very rough low RPM operation and difficult idling. The ideal engine would have fully variable valve <b>timing,</b> lift and <b>duration,</b> in which the valves would always open at exactly the right point, lift high enough and stay open {{just the right amount of}} time for the engine speed in use.|$|R
