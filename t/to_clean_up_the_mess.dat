After {{managing}} to rebuild their spaceship and returning safely to their home planet of Funkotron, the duo soon learn that a bunch of Earthlings had stowed away on their craft and have now invaded Funkotron. With the humans spreading panic across the planet's citizens, even scaring the source of all funk, Lamont the Funkapotomus, away to another dimension, it is up to ToeJam and Earl <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>mess</b> they've made and send all the Earthlings they brought with them back to where they came from.|$|E
5|$|Model {{spent the}} first year of World War II as a chief of staff, first of IV Corps during the {{invasion}} of Poland, and then of Sixteenth Army during the Battle of France. He was promoted to lieutenant general (Generalleutnant) in April 1940, and earned his first senior command posting in November that year, when he was assigned to lead the 3rd Panzer Division. He immediately proceeded to ignore all formalities of organization and command, which endeared him to his men and exasperated his staff—who often had <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>mess</b> he left behind. He also instituted a combined arms training programme where his men were thrown together in various ad-hoc groupings regardless of their parent unit: tankers would train with infantry, engineers with recon units, and so on. Model thus anticipated by some months the regular German use of Kampfgruppen in World War II. While this would become routine later on, it was still not a universal practice in the Wehrmacht in late 1940 and early 1941.|$|E
25|$|Three legends {{explain the}} {{formation}} of the Chocolate Hills. The first tells the story of two feuding giants who hurled rocks, boulders, and sand at each other. The fighting lasted for days, and exhausted the two giants.

25|$|During November 2007, Eduardo Maruri {{was elected}} President of Barcelona for the 2007–11 period.

However, the 2009 season was Barcelona's worst season in its history in the Serie A. Such teams as Deportivo Quito, ESPOLI, Deportivo Cuenca and LDU Portoviejo came out and spoke about their concern: if Barcelona were relegated, it would enormously impact those teams' economic situations, since when they would play at home against Barcelona it would almost guarantee a sell-out. (This was because Barcelona had the most fans of any team in Ecuador.) On October 3, 2009, more than 70,000 fans showed up at the Estadio Monumental Banco del Pichincha to support El Idolo del Ecuador so {{that it would not be}} relegated to the Serie B. In an intense match, Barcelona defeated LDU Portoviejo 2–0 with goals from José Luis Perlaza (46th minute) and Juan Samudio (90th minute). This allowed Barcelona to remain the only Ecuadorian team that has never played a game in Serie B.|$|E
25|$|The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo came in 1932. In 1934, Houston Junior College {{became a}} {{four-year}} institution and {{changed its name}} to the University of Houston. A flood in 1935 suddenly turned conditions for the worst, and Houstonians were forced <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>mess.</b> Air service by Braniff Airways and Eastern Air Lines came in 1935 and 1936. By the end of the decade, Houston was encountering growth pains, as the city had inadequate air service and that it was no longer a frontier town. Houston became the largest city in Texas in terms of population in 1939. Many immigrants and African-Americans from Louisiana and other parts of Texas moved to the city to find education or work. The city obtained a very multicultural atmosphere, with large African-American and immigrant communities scattered about. However, African-Americans faced bad housing and poor jobs during this time period. Nevertheless, African-American society developed so much that the city was, and still is, the African-American capital of Texas. The University of Houston moved to its present-day location donated by the Cullen family off of what would later be the first freeway in Houston, U.S. Highway 75 (now called Interstate 45), or Gulf Freeway.|$|E

On October 27, he swore in a twelve-member cabinet that included Ayub Khan as prime minister and three other generals in ministerial positions.

2500|$|On December 15, 1973, an 80-foot {{section of}} the {{northbound}} lanes between Little West 12th Street and Gansevoort Street collapsed {{under the weight of}} a dump truck, which was thought to carry over [...] of asphalt for ongoing repairs of the highway. The joints between transverse stringers holding up this section of roadway and the eastern main girder (holding the decorative freezes), failed. [...] A four-door sedan followed the truck through the hole; neither driver was seriously injured. It took hours to back all the traffic off the span trapped behind the collapse. It was later learned that the truck was actually carrying 30 tons of asphalt, and was 9 tons overloaded. Blame was assigned to the trucking company, Edenwald Construction Corp. of Whitestone, Queens, but they were still awarded a no-bid contract <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>mess.</b> The day after, both directions were closed indefintely south of 18th Street. This not only closed off the oldest section (between Canal Street and 18th Street), but also the newest sections (south of Canal Street), because ramps south of the collapse only permitted northbound entrances and southbound exits. The southernmost northbound exit was at 23rd Street.|$|E
2500|$|Phase 3: 1877, autumn: [...] The Chinese halted near Turfan {{for a few}} months, {{possibly}} to bring up supplies or avoid the summer heat. [...] The death of Yakub Beg had disorganized the rebels. There were various conflicts which need not be listed and no single leader arose to organize resistance. [...] In August an advance party left Turfan and the main body left on 27 September. [...] In early October Karashar and Korla were occupied. The rebels dammed the Kaidu River and flooded part of Karashar, but this did not stop the advance. Bayen Hu adopted a scorched earth policy, burning houses and crops and driving the people westward with his army. Kin Shun (Jin Shun) made a forced march and somewhere near Luntai sighted a mob, said to be some {{tens of thousands of}} people. [...] The rebel soldiers drew off from the civilians, a battle was fought and the Kashgaris fled to Kucha. When the Chinese reached Kucha they found the townspeople fighting the rebels, having no wish to accompany them westward. The Kashgaris fought the Chinese with some success, were defeated and fled, leaving 1000 dead on the battlefield. [...] A depot was set up at Kucha and some effort was made <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>mess</b> left by Bayan Hu. By the end of October Chang Yao brought up the rear guard and the advance was resumed toward Aksu. [...] During this time, General Zuo with the main army had been inactive north of the mountains. He somehow crossed the Tien Shan and joined the advance. The Chinese now had so many men and the rebels had been defeated so many times that Aksu and Uqturpan surrendered without a fight. (The commander of Aksu abandoned his post, was captured by the rebels and executed.) [...] On 17 December Kashgar was easily taken. [...] Yarkand, [...] Khotan and other places then submitted.|$|E

60|$|After breakfast I {{had another}} unenviable experience. When I had {{finished}} washing the dishes, I cleaned the cabin stove {{and carried the}} ashes up on deck to empty them.

As I started toward the weather side I saw him make a sudden motion with his head, which I mistook for a token of recognition and good-morning. In reality, he was attempting to warn me to throw my ashes over the lee side. Unconscious of my blunder, I passed by Wolf Larsen and the hunter and flung the ashes over the side to windward. The wind drove them back, and not only over me, but over Henderson and Wolf Larsen. The next instant the latter kicked me, violently, as a cur is kicked. I had not realized there could be so much pain in a kick. I reeled {{away from him and}} leaned against the cabin in a half-fainting condition. Everything was swimming before my eyes, and I turned sick. The nausea overpowered me, and I managed to crawl {{to the side of the}} vessel. But Wolf Larsen did not follow me up.
