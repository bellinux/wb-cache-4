5|$|During the 1960s, {{developments}} {{in the pattern of}} oil transportation indicated that it would soon become most economical to move oil between the Middle East and Europe using ultra large crude carrier (ULCC) vessels.

5|$|A {{month after}} Letcher signed the treaty, Clayton was {{replaced}} as Secretary of State by Daniel Webster. In response to concerns raised {{by one of}} the Americans hoping to construct the line of transit, Webster asked that Letcher attempt to obtain certain modifications to the treaty. Letcher brought these modifications to the Mexican diplomats, but they steadfastly refused to accept them. Letcher, speaking with the blessing of the administration, intimated that the United States would take the region by force if the requested concessions were not made. The Mexican government conceded <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be able to resist such action, but still refused to accept the modifications to the treaty.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, the Persian commanders were {{concerned}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> {{be able to}} defeat the Ionian fleet and, therefore, {{would not be able}} to take Miletus. So they sent the exiled Ionian tyrants to Lade, where each tried to persuade his fellow citizens to desert to the Persians. This approach was initially unsuccessful, but in the week-long delay before the battle, divisions arose in the Ionian camp. These divisions led to the Samians secretly agreeing to the terms offered by the Persians, but remained with the other Ionians for the time being.|$|E

He returned to Warmia where he was ordained subdeacon on 4 January 1597. Andrew and Stephen even announced <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> intervene in Transylvania.

5|$|Astana was {{at first}} not invited to the Giro. Six days before the race began, RCS Sport (the {{organizers}} of the Giro) went back on the decision to exclude Astana and extended them a late invitation. This change of heart was at least partly contingent on Contador, Leipheimer, and Klöden participating in the race. Having thought for two months prior <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> compete in the Giro, most of Astana's riders had planned {{to take a break}} during the Tour of Italy, and Contador was actually vacationing on a beach when Bruyneel called him to tell him the team was headed to the Giro.|$|E

The appearance of homosexual characters was at its height in 1933; in that year, Hays declared that all gay male characters would be removed from pictures. Paramount {{took advantage of the}} negative publicity Dietrich generated by signing a largely meaningless agreement stating <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> portray women in male attire.|$|E

Carlos Sastre, having taken a lead of about two minutes on the final climb of L'Alpe D'Huez, won the Tour, and the team took the team classification.|$|E

This was done in order to promote the idea that Cannibal Holocaust was truly the recovered footage of missing documentarians.
