40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} the cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) and cavum vergae (CV) findings. Methods: Thirteen <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> in the study. The {{study was conducted}} at the Department of Neurosurgery, Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia {{in the period of}} 2015 – 2016. Thirteen <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> for the study. Cavum septum pellucidum and CV spaces are relatively rare. During neurology and neurosurgery examination of patients with head computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CSP and CV were discovered accidentally. The incidence of these unique spaces reported from many countries, but have never been reported from Indonesia. 	 Results: This is the first-time reported incidental finding of CSP and CV from Indonesia, 13 cases in one-year period. Since the presence of CSP and CV is usually asymptomatic, clinician seem don’t really care to put it in their report. Conclusions: The presence of CSP and CV as a common incidental finding can be more revealed in our country in years to come and hopefully can be more studied in term of anatomical landmark on neurosurgical field...|$|R

30|$|This {{study has}} some limitations: (i) the <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> a non-intentional, non-probabilistic type and {{therefore}} {{may not be}} representative of the general population of Brazil; (ii) the <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> <b>recruited</b> from a single region of Brazil, given the enormous cultural and religious diversity of the country future studies in other regions are necessary; (iii) the <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> not gender balanced, making it impossible to verify the metric invariance for this independent variable and (iv) this is the first published validation of the SWBQ in the Brazilian cultural context. It is important that further research validating the SWBQb is carried out, paying special attention to convergent and discriminant validity, as there was some inconsistency in our results in these areas.|$|R
40|$|The partial {{pressures}} of Te 2 in equilibrium with Ga(1 -x) Te(x) <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> measured by optical absorption technique from 450 to 1100 C for compositions, x, between 0. 333 and 0. 612.

The partial {{pressures of}} Te 2 in equilibrium with the GaTe(s) and Ga 2 Te 3 (s) compounds, or the so-called three-phase curves, were established. These partial pressure data imply the existence of the Ga 3 Te 4 (s) compound. From the partial pressures of Te 2 over the Ga-Te melts, partial molar enthalpy and entropy of mixing for Te were derived and they agree reasonable well with the published data. The activities of Te in the Ga-Te melts were also derived from the measured partial pressures of Te 2. These data agree well with most of the previous results. The possible reason for the high activity of Te measured for x less than 0. 60 is discussed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSeveral {{attempts}} were made during the last 3 decades {{to improve the quality}} of CdTe in order to enhance its efficiency as material for nuclear and photovoltaic devices. These attempts considered the high values of impurity segregation coefficients and the contamination problems due to handling at high temperature. In this study, we prepared three high purity CdTe single crystals with high resistivity. The three starting <b>Te</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> purified through three purification processes: horizontal zone refining, vacuum distillation, and by combining both processes. Purities were characterized, by determining the concentration of 22 impurities by Atomic Absorption (AASGF), for the three kinds of tellurium ingots and the corresponding elaborated CdTe materials. A series of four effective segregation coefficients for metallic impurities: Ag, Al, Cu, and Fe were found in CdTe. Their high values confirmed the difficulty to remove them by the purification processes using the segregation phenomenon. In addition, the low concentration values of impurities in CdTe samples (≥ 6 N purity) make from our CdTe high quality electronic grade materials...|$|R

40|$|Published online: 31 July 2015 OBJECTIVE: To assess {{dietary intake}} of {{pregnant}} women against the Australian Dietary Guidelines {{with respect to the}} Five Food Group recommendations and determine predictors of adherence to the recommendations. DESIGN: Cross-sectional web-based survey. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression. SETTING: Pregnant women living in Australia. A national <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> <b>recruited</b> using an online panel provider and a South Australian <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> <b>recruited</b> through the antenatal clinic of a large public maternity hospital. SUBJECTS: A total of 857 pregnant women. RESULTS: Fifty-six per cent, 29 % and less than 10 % of women met the recommendations for the fruit, dairy and other core food groups, respectively. None of the women met the recommendations for all Five Food Groups. Women who were born overseas and who were less physically active pre-pregnancy were less likely to adhere to the fruit and dairy recommendations. Women who smoked during pregnancy, were overweight pre-pregnancy and had lower household incomes were also less likely to meet the fruit recommendations; and women living in metropolitan areas were less likely to meet the vegetable recommendations. Sixty-one per cent believed their diet during this pregnancy was healthy. CONCLUSIONS: The majority {{of pregnant women}} in Australia perceive their diets to be healthy yet they do not consume the recommended daily servings from the Five Food Groups. Intervention strategies are warranted, particularly those that increase women's ability to evaluate their diet and also encourage positive dietary changes. These strategies may increase adoption of dietary guidelines and optimise pregnancy and other long-term health outcomes. Lenka Malek, Wendy Umberger, Maria Makrides, Shao J Zho...|$|R

Comments are made from our experience oil these algorithms, and, on the inversion procedure from experimental R/sigma-B to S-mu specifically with least square fitting as an example. Amongst the conclusions drawn are: (i) Experimentally measured resistivity (R-xx, R-xy) should also be used instead of just the inverted conductivity (sigma(xx), sigma(xy)) to fit data to semiclassical expressions for better fits especially at higher B. (ii) High magnetic field is necessary to extract low mobility carrier parameters. (iii) Provided the error in data is not large, better estimates to carrier parameters of remaining carrier species can be obtained at any stage by subtracting highest mobility carrier contribution to sigma from the experimental data and fitting with the remaining carriers. (iv) Even in presence of high electric field, an approximate multicarrier expression {{can be used to}} guess the carrier mobilities and their variations before solving the full Boltzmann equation...|$|R
