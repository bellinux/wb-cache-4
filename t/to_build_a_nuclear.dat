5|$|In December 1940 Bacher {{joined the}} Radiation Laboratory at MIT, {{but did not}} {{immediately}} cease his research. He reached an arrangement with its director, Lee Alvin DuBridge, to return to Cornell for four days every three weeks until it was completed. He was researching the neutron cross section of cadmium, a topic of interest to Enrico Fermi, who was attempting <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> reactor, but whose figures {{did not agree with}} Bacher's. Bacher carefully checked his results, and Fermi, convinced of their correctness, urged Bacher to publish them. Bacher submitted a paper to the Physical Review with instructions to withhold publication until after the war, and the paper was not published until 1946.|$|E
5|$|Szilárd {{teamed up}} with Fermi <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> reactor from natural uranium at Columbia University, where they were {{fortunate}} in having a sympathetic head of the physics department in George B. Pegram. At the time there was disagreement about whether it was uranium-235, which made up less than 1% of natural uranium, or the more abundant uranium-238 isotope, as Fermi maintained, that was primarily responsible for fission. Fermi and Szilárd {{conducted a series of}} experiments, and concluded that a chain reaction in natural uranium could be possible if they could find a suitable neutron moderator. They found that the hydrogen atoms in water slowed neutrons, but tended to capture them. Szilárd then suggested using carbon as a moderator. They now needed large quantities of carbon and uranium to create a reactor. Szilárd was convinced that they would succeed if only they could get the materials.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s {{there was a}} {{proposal}} <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> power station in West Berlin, but the project was dropped in 1962. Another attempt to site a reactor in a major city was made in 1967, when BASF planned <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> power station on its ground at Ludwigshafen, to supply process steam. Eventually the project was withdrawn by BASF.|$|E

25|$|The {{birth of}} the anti-nuclear {{movement}} in California {{can be traced to}} controversy over Pacific Gas & Electric's attempt to build the nation's first commercially viable nuclear power plant in Bodega Bay. This conflict began in 1958 and ended in 1964, with the forced abandonment of these plans. Subsequent plans <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> power plant in Malibu were also abandoned.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s plans <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> fuel {{reprocessing}} {{plant in the}} Bavarian town of Wackersdorf lead to major protests. In 1986, West German police were confronted by demonstrators armed with slingshots, crowbars and Molotov cocktails {{at the site of}} a nuclear reprocessing plant in Wackersdorf. The plans for the plant were abandoned in 1988. It still isn't clear whether protests or plant economics led to the decision.|$|E

25|$|In February 2009, NuGeneration (NuGen), a {{consortium}} of GDF Suez, Iberdrola and Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE), announced plans <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> new <b>nuclear</b> power station of up to 3.6GW capacity at Sellafield. In October 2009, NuGen purchased an option to acquire land around Sellafield from the NDA for £70m.|$|R
25|$|Blix {{personally}} made repeated {{inspection visits}} to the Iraqi nuclear reactor Osiraq before its attempted destruction by the Iranians, in 1980, and its eventual destruction by the Israeli Air Force in 1981 during Operation Opera. Although most agreed that Iraq was years away from being able <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapon, the Iranians and the Israelis felt any raid must occur well before nuclear fuel was loaded to prevent nuclear fallout. The attack was regarded as being in breach of the United Nations Charter (S/RES/487) and international law and was widely condemned.|$|E
25|$|Pacific Gas & Electric {{planned to}} build the first commercially viable nuclear power plant in the USA at Bodega Bay, a fishing village fifty miles north of San Francisco. The {{proposal}} was controversial and conflict with local citizens began in 1958. In 1963 {{there was a large}} demonstration {{at the site of the}} proposed Bodega Bay Nuclear Power Plant. The conflict ended in 1964, with the forced abandonment of plans for the power plant. Attempts <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> power plant in Malibu were similar to those at Bodega Bay and were also abandoned.|$|E
25|$|In September 2007, the Central Java {{division}} and Jepara {{branch of the}} Indonesian organisation Nahdlatul Ulama (the Awakening of the Religious Scholars) declared the government's proposal <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> power station nearby at Balong on the Muria peninsula haram or forbidden. The fatwā was issued following a two-day meeting {{of more than a}} hundred ulama to consider {{the pros and cons of}} the proposal addressed by government ministers, scientists and critics. The decision cited both positive and negative aspects of the proposal, which it had balanced to make its judgment. Key concerns were the question of long-term safe disposal and storage of radioactive waste, the potential local and regional environmental consequences of the plant’s operation, the lack of financial clarity about the project, and issues of foreign technological dependence.|$|E

25|$|In 1956, the {{increasingly}} pro-Soviet President Nasser of Egypt, announced the nationalization of the (French and British owned) Suez Canal, which was Egypt's {{main source of}} foreign currency. Egypt also blockaded the Gulf of Aqaba preventing Israeli access to the Red Sea. Israel made a secret agreement with the French at Sèvres to coordinate military operations against Egypt. Britain and France had already begun secret preparations for military action. It has been alleged that the French also agreed <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> plant for the Israelis and that by 1968 this was able to produce nuclear weapons. Britain and France arranged for Israel {{to give them a}} pretext for seizing the Suez Canal. Israel was to attack Egypt, and Britain and France would then call on both sides to withdraw. When, as expected, the Egyptians refused, Anglo-French forces would invade {{to take control of the}} Canal.|$|E

500|$|There {{remained}} {{the issue of}} cooperation between the Manhattan's Project's Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago and the Montreal Laboratory. At the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 17 February 1944, Chadwick pressed for resources <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> reactor at what {{is now known as}} the Chalk River Laboratories. Britain and Canada agreed to pay the cost of this project, but the United States had to supply the heavy water. At that time, the United States controlled, by a supply contract, the only major production site on the continent, that of the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company at Trail, British Columbia. Given that it was unlikely to have any impact on the war, Conant in particular was cool about the proposal, but heavy water reactors were of great interest. Groves was willing to support the effort and supply the heavy water required, but with certain restrictions. The Montreal Laboratory would have access to data from the research reactors at Argonne and the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, but not from the production reactors at the Hanford Site; nor would they be given any information about plutonium. This arrangement was formally approved by the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 19 September 1944. The Canadian ZEEP (Zero Energy Experimental Pile) reactor [...] went critical on 5 September 1945.|$|E
