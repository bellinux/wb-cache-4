30|$|Yet, as we {{have shown}} {{in the first part}} of this paper, it is clear that a small, but {{certainly}} not insignificant, share of households will experience problems in purchasing an adequate level of car-based mobility and accessibility. Their problems are to some extent mitigated through the provision of <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> <b>via</b> public expenditures. Governments typically spend public budgets on creating, maintaining and operating walking and cycling infrastructures, public <b>transport</b> <b>services,</b> and on-demand mobility services (for instance for the elderly and for persons experiencing travel-related impairments). While these infrastructures and services are typically (heavily) subsidized in the sense that the full costs of provision are not born directly by the users, their provision and continued operation is often subject to considerations of economic efficiency, at best in addition to considerations of welfare. Considerations of welfare and equity, in turn, have been poorly specified in the domain of transport, which makes the sector stand out vis-à-vis the other policy domains discussed above. Martens and Lucas argue that much of the public subsidies are best seen as some form of charity or benevolence, rather than a matter of justice ([45]). Equity principles empower (potential) recipients and in particular weak population groups vis-à-vis state institutions. In contrast, when public subsidies are distributed as a matter of charity, the power remains in the hands of the benefactor, i.e. the government, who can give, withhold or withdraw subsidies as it sees fit. Hence our conclusion that the domain of transport cannot (yet) be seen as a pillar of welfare states.|$|R

Among the four different FTTH architectures considered, the curbside single-wavelength Passive Optical Network architecture (PON) that has isolated pole-mounted splitters has the most economical fiber plant but permits unbundling only at the logical layer. Consequently, though a PON supports ‘open access’ based competition in higher layer services like voice, data and switched digital video, it does not facilitate competition in data-link layer services or in the provision of analog broadcast video services. In complete contrast, the Home Run architecture has the highest initial (fiber related) capital cost, but permits unbundling of both the physical plant and at the logical layer. The Home Run architecture therefore supports a per subscriber choice of data-link layer <b>services</b> (<b>via</b> UNE based competition) as well as competition in higher layer voice, video and data <b>services</b> (<b>via</b> open access). This work further identifies deployment strategies, which can facilitate physical plant unbundling at costs much lower than the Home Run architecture. Physical plant unbundling is made possible by establishing Optimal Fiber Aggregation Points (OFAPs) that aggregate multiple distribution fibers (or homes). Unbundling is achieved at the cost of longer distribution loop lengths (vis-à-vis a curbside PON). Ideally, both passive splitters and active electronics can be deployed at an OFAP. OFAP architectures further lead to higher utilization of splitter and Optical Line Termination (OLT) ports in markets that have less than 100 % penetration thereby providing the service provider with a real option to (i) defer investment in OLT ports (ii) deploy multiple data-link layer technologies and (iii) effectively phase in new technologies - under both monopoly and competition...|$|R

30|$|The {{pressure}} drop encountered in {{heavy crude oil}} transportation <b>via</b> <b>pipelines</b> is more acute when {{it is to be}} transported over a long distances; therefore drag reduction by incorporating an additive becomes an option. The transportation of crude oil <b>via</b> <b>pipelines</b> is mostly in the turbulent flow regime. Additionally, high frictional loss as a result of high viscosity causes much of the energy applied to transport the crude oil to be wasted. High drag in turbulent flow is caused by radial transport of flow momentum by fluid eddies. Polymer drag reduction was discovered decades ago by Toms (1948), who observed about 30 - 40  % drag reduction upon the addition of polymer (methyl methacrylate) to turbulent monochlorobenzene flowing <b>via</b> <b>pipeline.</b> In this respect, drag-reducing additives help to reduce friction near the pipeline walls and within the turbulent fluid core of moving fluid. Therefore, for energy conservation and high efficiency of bitumen and heavy crude oil transfer, drag reduction is vital.|$|R
