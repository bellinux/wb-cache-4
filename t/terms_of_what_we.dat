We present an approach to modeling and quantifying behavior in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> transformations accomplish. <b>We</b> structure activity into dataflow diagrams that capture the flow between transformations. Across disparate implementations, we observe commonalities in how transformations use and change their inputs. We introduce vocabulary of common phenomena of use and change, and four ways to classify data and transformations using this vocabulary. The structuring and classification enable evaluation and comparison in terms abstracted from implementation specifics. We introduce metrics of complexity and cost, including behavior signatures that attribute measures to phenomena.

In order to evaluate taste in this context, we must explore all the ways in which taste can be defined. According to Alan Weiss, taste fulfills the purpose of six functions: taste is the tool in which we use to define flavor; it is also flavor and how we categorize flavor (sweet or salty); it is the preference, we as the tastemakers, place on specific flavors and our demand for those flavors; it is whether we choose to like or dislike a certain taste and therefore allow it into our general society of acceptable tastes or exile it; it is the value in which we place on certain taste (one might believe one's taste in Bach or Rothko earns one capital); and lastly, with good judgement comes good taste and therefore, one with expressively good taste are expected to have good judgement, just as those in bad taste are expected to be in bad judgement ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} {{insights}} from the African Perspectives on Human Mobility research programme, which included four research teams based at universities in Ghana, Nigeria, Morocco and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The paper first provides some {{details on the}} background and findings of the projects conducted by the four teams in various African cities. It then turns to some reflections on the theoretical implications and questions raised by these research findings and presents four broad points. First, by showing African cities {{as a place of}} attraction for international migrants, these findings highlight the curious absence of other research into international migration towards other African cities. Second, the city is a zone of departure not just in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> being a stepping stone to long-distance migration, but also in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> being <b>what</b> <b>we</b> might call a ‘forge’ for migratory behaviour – where migration is shaped through urban life. Third, the paper draws attention to the different practices of integration and exclusion of migrants that are in evidence in these African cities, again observing the limited research in this area. Fourth, in contrast to the global cities literature, which largely bypasses the African continent, we note that the cities included in this study are clearly enmeshed in transnational and global networks, not merely as departure points for migrants, but also, significantly, as attractive spaces for migrants and mobile traders – for creativity, connections and exchange. The paper concludes by reflecting on how we might better understand the links between internal, regional and inter-continental migration in the context of Africa, suggesting that examining global African migrations in more detail may help us understand better the emergence of new migration systems...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a case study}} of applying machine learning tools to build a predictive model of annual infestations of grasshoppers in Eastern Oregon. The {{purpose of the study was}} two-fold. First, we wanted to develop a predictive model. Second, we wanted to explore the capabilities of existing machine learning tools and identify areas where further research was needed. The study succeeded in constructing a model with modest ability to predict future grasshopper infestations and provide advice to farmers about whether to treat their croplands with pesticides. Our analysis of the learned model shows that it should be able to provide useful advice if the ratio of treatment cost to crop damage cost is 1 to 1. 67 or more. However, there is some evidence that the model is not able to make good predictions in years with extremely high levels of grasshopper infestation. To arrive at this successful model, three critical steps had to be taken. First, we had to properly formulate the prediction task both in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>we</b> were trying to predict (i. e., the probability of infestation) and the spatial area over which we could make predictions (i. e., areas within 6. 77 kms radius of a weather station). Second, we had to define and extract a set of features that incorporated knowledge of the grasshopper life cycle. Third, we had to employ evaluation metrics that were able to measure small improvements in the quality of predictions. The study identified important directions for future research. In the area of grasshopper ecology, there is a need for improved data gathering tools including a much denser and more widespread network of weather stations. These stations should also measure subsoil temperatures. Recording of the dates of hatching of grasshopper nymphs would also be very valuable. In machine learning, methods are needed for automating the definition and extraction of features guided by qualitative knowledge of the domain, such as our qualitative knowledge of the grasshopper lifecycle...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In 1945 Bhabha was {{probably}} the first to discuss the problem of a free relativistic particle with arbitrary spin in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> a single linear equation in the four-momentum vector p, but substituting the γ matrices of Dirac by other ones. He determined the latter by requiring that their appropriate Lorentz transformations lead to their formulation in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the generators of the O(5) group. His program was later extensively amplified by Krajcik, Nieto and others. We returned to this problem because we had an ab-initio procedure for deriving a Lorentz-invariant equation of arbitrary spin and furthermore could express the matrices appearing in them in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> ordinary and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> called sign spins.

In the ordinary and sign spin formulation it is easy to transform our equation into one linear in both the p and some of the generators of O(5). We can then obtain the matrix representation of our equation for an irrep (n 1 n 2 / of O(5) and find, through a similarity transformation, that for the irrep mentioned the particle satisfying our equation will have, in general, several spins and masses determined by a simple algorithm. 1...|$|R

40|$|Zooplankton are {{incredibly}} important for marine ecosystem as {{they play a}} pivotal role in marine food web dynamics. (Almeda 201). Zooplankton are not a single type of organism, but rather refers to organisms that ‘drift’ in the ocean, comprised of invertebrates and fish larvae. For these organisms, size is no indication of value, as they are at the foundation of the marine food web, and an important source of protein in the ocean. According to Banse (1995), ‘zooplankton {{play a key role in}} marine pelagic ecosystems as grazers on phytoplankton and microzooplankton, exporters of carbon and nutrients from surface waters, and vectors for carbon and toxins to higher trophic levels’. Zooplankton {{are incredibly}} important in marine pelagic ecosystems (Cohen et al. 2014). There are micro-& meso-zooplankton (depend on size), and they do a number of things. Zooplankton will graze on the phytoplankton and smaller zooplankton, making these available for higher trophic levels. While all zooplankton are important, I will be focusing on type of mesozooplankton called ‘copepods’. These are often dominant in zooplankton food web, and are key sources of energy for other organisms. Furthermore, there have been many studies performed on this group of organisms, particularly in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> effects oil spills might have on them. Copepods are a dominant group of mesozooplankton that form calcium carbonate shells. The effects of oil spills on copepods are not taken into account in environmental assessments. However, as will be demonstrated, impacts on these copepods could have farreaching effects in the ecosystem, some that cannot be predicted. There is limited information available on this subject. Because they are so small and numerous, impacts on them are expected to be negligible. But this might be a false assumption, and could prove to be dangerous since effects on zooplankton could have an impact on the higher trophic levels that feed on it. For instance, there many organisms that feed on zooplankton, such as cod, particularly in the early stages of life, and so impacts on zooplankton could inadvertently harm these other organisms. Data was missing for the west coast in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> zooplankton <b>we</b> have here. I looked at different areas of the gulf and obtained data on the type of zooplankton located there. The study I found recorded data for areas in the southwest as well as the Northwest Gulf of St-Lawrence (name these two areas). I also looked at information of zooplankton along the eastern coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, and in general of types of zooplankton in the Northern Atlantic. Oil spills can affect these buggers in a number of ways, not just from the immediate physical effects, but also in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the dispersants and the myriad of toxic compounds that they contain, and longer term effects, and sub-lethal effects that are often glossed over. Since there is growing interest in oil development in the Gulf of St-Lawrence, and along the west coast of Newfoundland, this research comes at an important time. Also given that such oil spills as the Exxon Valdez spill, which we will touch upon later, and the BP oil spill, have proven to have catastrophic events. I will be seeking to answer the following questions: - 1) What is the role of copepods in the Gulf of St. Lawrence marine environment? - 2) What are the major aspects of oil and gas development in the gulf that could affect copepods and what are the implications of these factors...|$|R
