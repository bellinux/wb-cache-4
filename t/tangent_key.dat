40|$|This paper {{presents}} a tangential interpolatory projection model reduction method {{for the class}} of completely passive linear quantum stochastic systems, often encountered in quantum optics and related fields. We show that the important physical realizability property of the full-order system is preserved through the interpolatory projection approximation. Sufficient conditions that guarantee asymptotic stability and minimality of the reduced-order approximation are established. We also present an optimization based routine for selection of interpolation points and propose a heuristic approach to select <b>tangent</b> directions, the <b>key</b> elements of the interpolatory projection method for multiple-input multiple-output systems.

25|$|The drone strings produce steady sounds at fixed pitches. The melody string(s) (French chanterelle(s), Hungarian dallamhúr(ok)) are {{stopped with}} <b>tangents</b> {{attached}} to <b>keys</b> {{that change the}} vibration length of the string, much as a guitarist uses his or her fingers on the fretboard of a guitar. In the earliest hurdy-gurdies these keys were arranged to provide a Pythagorean temperament, but in later instruments the tunings have varied widely, with equal temperament most common because it allows easier blending with other instruments. However, because the tangents can be adjusted to tune individual notes, {{it is possible to}} tune hurdy-gurdies to almost any temperament as needed. Most contemporary hurdy-gurdies have 24 keys that cover a range of two chromatic octaves.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the string}} vibrates {{from the bridge}} {{only as far as}} the <b>tangent,</b> {{multiple}} <b>keys</b> with multiple <b>tangents</b> can be assigned to the same string. This is called fretting. Early clavichords frequently had many notes played on each string, even going so far as the keyed monochord [...] - [...] an instrument with only one string—though most clavichords were triple- or double-fretted. Since only one note can be played at a time on each string, the fretting pattern is generally chosen so that notes rarely heard together (such as C and C) share a string pair. The advantages of this system compared with unfretted instruments (see below) include relative ease of tuning (with around half as many strings to keep in tune), greater volume (though still not really enough for use in chamber music), and a clearer, more direct sound. Among the disadvantages: temperament could not be re-set without bending the tangents; and playing required a further refinement of touch, since notes sharing a single string played in quick succession had to be slightly separated to avoid a disagreeable deadening of the sound, potentially disturbing a legato line.|$|R

Motivated by {{visibility}} {{problems in}} three dimensions, we investigate {{the complexity and}} construction of the set of tangent lines in a scene of three-dimensional polyhedra. We prove that the set of lines tangent to four possibly intersecting convex polyhedra in R 3 {{with a total of}} n edges consists of Θ(n 2) connected components in the worst case. In the generic case, each connected component is a single line, but our result still holds for arbitrarily degenerate scenes. More generally, we show that a set of k possibly intersecting convex polyhedra with a total of n edges admits, in the worst case, Θ(n 2 k 2) connected components of maximal free line segments tangent to at least four polytopes. Furthermore, these bounds also hold for possibly occluded lines rather than maximal free line segments. Finally, we present an O(n 2 k 2 log n) time and O(nk 2) space algorithm that, given a scene of k possibly intersecting convex polyhedra, computes all the minimal free line segments that are tangent to any four of the polytopes and are isolated transversals to the set of edges they intersect; in particular, we compute at least one line segment per connected component of <b>tangent</b> lines. <b>Key</b> words. computational geometry, 3 D visibility, visibility complex, visual event...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{pairwise}} <b>key</b> agreement, TLPKA (<b>Tangent</b> Line Pairwise <b>Key</b> Agreement), for establishing a secure link between members {{in an ad}} hoc network. With pairwise keys, data transmitted in ad hoc networks can be protected from the eavesdropping of outsiders. These pairwise keys {{can also be used}} to authenticate members in ad hoc networks. In addition, due to the property of uniqueness of pairwise keys, it also provides non-repudiation for data transmitting. In our scheme, we propose a new idea for the design of pairwise key agreements in an ad hoc network. Our scheme is based on the geometrical property of the tangent line and the mechanisms in our scheme are inspired by the Shamir secret sharing scheme. Our schemes also provide reciprocal authentication among node communicants. The robustness of our scheme is based on the DH problem and the indefinite solutions in coordinate geometry. In addition, we compare our scheme with other schemes. Although there is a higher overhead associated with our scheme, it maintains a higher security level than the other schemes. 1...|$|R
40|$|Tangent {{categories}} are categories {{equipped with a}} tangent functor: an endofunctor with certain natural transformations which make it behave like the tangent bundle functor on the category of smooth manifolds. They provide an abstract setting for differential geometry by axiomatizing key aspects of the subject which allow the basic theory of these geometric settings to be captured. Importantly, they have models not only in classical differential geometry and its extensions, but also in algebraic geometry, combinatorics, computer science, and physics. This paper develops the theory of "differential bundles" for such categories, considers their relation to "differential objects", and develops the theory of fibrations of tangent categories. Differential bundles generalize the notion of smooth vector bundles in classical differential geometry. However, the definition departs from the standard one in several significant ways: in general, there is no scalar multiplication in the fibres of these bundles, and in general these bundles need not be locally trivial. To understand how these differential bundles relate to differential objects, which are the generalization of vector spaces in smooth manifolds, requires some careful handling of the behaviour of pullbacks {{with respect to the}} tangent functor. This is captured by "transverse" and "display" systems for tangent categories, which leads one into the fibrational theory of <b>tangent</b> categories. A <b>key</b> example of a tangent fibration is provided by the "display" differential bundles of a tangent category with a display system. Strikingly, in such examples the fibres are Cartesian differential categories demonstrating a [...] not unexpected [...] tight connection between the theory of these categories and that of tangent categories.
