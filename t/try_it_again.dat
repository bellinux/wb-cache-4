25|$|On November 6, 1986 Eastern Air Lines Captain George Baines {{was flying}} {{in his private}} aircraft, a Piper PA-23 (N2185P), from his home to Tampa International to catch a flight. As he {{approached}} Tampa International's runway 36L (now 1L) in heavy fog, he declared a missed approach and went around to <b>try</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> On the second attempt, he touched down on a parallel taxiway and ultimately collided with a Pan Am 727–200 that was taxiing on this taxiway. Baines lost {{his life in the}} accident. He was the only fatality. No other injuries were reported.|$|E
25|$|Red Cloud {{and other}} Indian leaders, {{encouraged}} by their successes, decided {{to undertake a}} large military operation against Fort Kearny before winter snows forced them to break up their large village on the Tongue River and disperse. The decoy trick had worked on December 6 {{and they decided to}} <b>try</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> this time with a force adequate to destroy any group of soldiers sent to chase them. The warriors, possibly numbering more than 1,000, congregated about 10 miles north of Fort Kearny, reconnoitered, and decided the best place to lay the trap was along the Bozeman trail north of Lodge Trail ridge. It was out of sight but only about four miles from Fort Kearny. The Cheyenne and Arapaho took up positions {{on the west side of}} the trail and the Lakota on the east. The group of Indians chosen to decoy the soldiers included the young Oglala, Crazy Horse.|$|E
500|$|The Great Mutato {{was played}} by Chris Owens, unrecognizable in heavy makeup. Owens {{had played a}} younger version of The Smoking Man in two episodes of season four and was later cast as the {{recurring}} character of FBI special agent Jeffrey Spender. During his audition, Owens noted, [...] "Chris said, 'Okay, {{did you ever see}} Elephant Man?... What I'm looking for is dignity. He's got dignity. But he's definitely mutated'". After Owens heeded Carter's instructions and attempted to bring dignity to the audition, Carter requested that he <b>try</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> [...] "with less autism".|$|E
5000|$|The {{band members}} did {{consider}} self-producing the record however found {{they had a}} lack of experience and knowledge in production. Rohin Jones spoke about how the band was never pleased with the final product and kept restarting, which lead to them recording throughout the year: [...] "we scrapped <b>it</b> and then <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> and scrapped that and <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> and scrapped that, so we’ve really pieced it together over time. And maybe that’s just how we work and we haven’t {{come to terms with}} it yet, but it’s definitely not the best process for writing an album." ...|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} Spring 1976, Andrews and Sugarman <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> CS met with no greater success in 1976-1977 {{than it had}} two years earlier, and the program ended {{production}} {{at the end of}} that season.|$|R
500|$|Meade {{made his}} {{decision}} {{late that night}} in a council of war that included his senior staff officers and corps commanders. The assembled officers agreed that, despite the beating the army took, it was advisable for the army to remain in its present position and to await attack by the enemy, although there was some disagreement about how long to wait if Lee chose not to attack. There {{is some evidence that}} Meade had already decided this issue and was using the meeting not as a formal council of war, but as a way to achieve consensus among officers he had commanded for less than a week. As the meeting broke up, Meade took aside Brig. Gen. John Gibbon, in command of the II Corps, and predicted, [...] "If Lee attacks tomorrow, it will be in your front. ... he has made attacks on both our flanks and failed and if he concludes to <b>try</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> it will be on our centre." ...|$|E
500|$|After a stay of six weeks, Black was {{released}} from the hospital in late October 1948. He continued to suffer from headaches, however, and had to have further surgery done in December to remove a weak spot in an artery near his head. He {{was released}} from the hospital shortly afterward, but by the start of 1949 his time with the Indians was over, as Bill Veeck stated he would not accept the responsibility of allowing Black to pitch again, though said [...] "If Black is determined to <b>try</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> I won't stand in his way." [...] This statement, however, did not keep Black away, as he signed a contract in late January with the Indians for the same amount as the previous season. After pitching with the Indians in Florida for spring training, he returned to Cleveland and decided to retire temporarily, citing that he felt too weak to be effective. He made one final pitching appearance before retiring in an exhibition game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 13, pitching two innings for the Indians in a 10 loss.|$|E
500|$|In the single-player mode, the game's main [...] {{sees the}} player {{take on the}} part of a Terran pilot, in which they engage in a series of {{missions}} that become increasingly challenging and sophisticated overtime the more the progress into the campaign; the difficulty level of the campaign can be changed at any time, in between missions. To ease players into the various controls of the game, training missions are included in the campaign, mixed in between regular missions, that gradually introduce the player to advanced commands and techniques. Completing a mission and subsequently unlocking the next one, requires meeting a number of objective defined for it, although not all need to be completed to end the mission successfully; some are scripted to be failed as part of the campaign's story. If a player dies on a mission, or fail to complete vital objectives (i.e. protecting an important ship), players can restart a mission and <b>try</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> In missions, players receive directives tied to their missions, such as destroying a target, protecting an asset, or another task (i.e. inspecting something), which turn blue for completion, red for being failed; multiple targets of a directive (such as destroying an enemy wing) include a number in brackets that decreases as targets are destroyed or depart.|$|E
60|$|In {{the first}} place, he warned Lucilla, if the {{operation}} failed, {{that there would}} be no possibility of returning to <b>it,</b> and <b>trying</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> Once done, be the results what they might, it was done for good.|$|R
5000|$|The German Rowohlt Verlag {{published}} {{only the}} first volume in 1982 under their mass-market label rororo. Carlsen Comics <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> in 2004 but cancelled the publication after four volumes. Both publishers took the name [...] "Barfuß durch Hiroshima" [...] (Barefoot through Hiroshima).|$|R
6000|$|... "Look out, Whopper!" [...] screamed Snap, {{and then}} he raised his own gun to take another shot. But the hammer merely clicked. He <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> in {{increased}} haste, {{and as a consequence}} shot wild, the charge going over the wildcat's head.|$|R
500|$|The main cast was put {{together}} {{through a process of}} auditions and readings. Actors often did not know whether Chase liked their performances or not. Michael Imperioli, who beat out several actors for the part of Christopher Moltisanti, recalls [...] "He's got a poker face, so I thought he wasn't into me, and he kept giving me notes and having me <b>try</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> which often is a sign that you're not doing it right. I thought, I'm not getting this. So he said, 'Thank you,' and I left. I didn't expect to hear back. And then they called." [...] Chase also said he wanted Imperioli because he had been in Goodfellas. James Gandolfini was invited to audition for the part of Tony Soprano after casting director Susan Fitzgerald saw a short clip of his performance in the 1993 film True Romance. Lorraine Bracco, who had played the role of mob wife Karen Hill in Goodfellas, was originally asked {{to play the role of}} Carmela Soprano. She took the role of Dr. Jennifer Melfi instead because she wanted to try something different and felt the part of the highly educated Dr. Melfi would be more of a challenge for her. Tony Sirico, who has a criminal background, signed on to play Paulie Walnuts as long as his character was not to be a [...] "rat".|$|E
500|$|The {{third and}} final session, in the evening on 15 October, {{produced}} four more recordings that completed the album— [...] "The Way Young Lovers Do" [...] "Sweet Thing", [...] "Ballerina" [...] and [...] "Slim Slow Slider". Davis expressed to Rolling Stone {{that there was a}} [...] "certain feel about a seven-to-ten o' clock session" [...] and that [...] "the ambience of that time of day was all through everything we played". Both [...] "Sweet Thing" [...] and [...] "Ballerina" [...] were originally scheduled for the session, but the search for a 'closer' consumed a considerable amount of time. [...] They attempted (and rejected) a number of songs until Morrison suggested [...] "Slim Slow Slider". [...] "I don't think we'd ever done [...] live," [...] recalls Payne. [...] " [...] had a book full of songs... I don't know why he decided to do it...And we were first doing it with the drums, with Richard Davis and Connie Kay and the guitar player and the vibe player and me and Van— all of us were playing. Then I started playing soprano sax on the thing, and Lew said, 'OK, I wanna <b>try</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> Start again. And I want just the bass, the soprano sax, and Van.'" [...] It was a successful take, but it also came with a very long coda, prompting Merenstein to make a large cut during the editing process. Many of the tracks on Astral Weeks would be subjected to edits (mainly to tighten the performances), but the one on [...] "Slim Slow Slider" [...] was easily the most substantial. [...] "I would estimate three, five minutes of instrumental stuff," [...] says Payne. [...] "We went through stages [...] we got to be avant-garde kind of weird, which is what you hear after the splice – all that weird stuff we're playing – but there was a whole progression to that." [...] According to Merenstein, before he cut it, the coda [...] "was a long, long ending that went nowhere, that just carried on from minute to minute...If it had [...] relativity to the tune itself, I would have left it there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Game Revolution's Johnny Lee {{scored the}} PC version an A-, calling the game [...] "Non-stop 3D shooting, killing, exploding, dodging, parachuting, running, ambushing, assassinating, jumping, mind blowing action!" [...] He wrote, [...] "Did {{you think that}} the 3D gaming style in Mario 64 was awesome, but the game just too soft for you? <b>Try</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> with a twist of Doom and you can say [...] "up yours" [...] to those soft-core, non-violent, weak-ass kiddy games." [...] He praised the gameplay, sniping mode, the bombing minigame, and the game's acerbic sense of humor. He {{concluded}} [...] "MDK combines sweet graphics and 'revolutionary' gameplay and design concepts to put it in a class by itself. Thank heavens someone decided to create something revolutionary rather than dupe others' successful ideas." ...|$|E
50|$|In the {{eleventh}} stage, Rominger <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> But again, Indurain stayed with him. Rominger won the stage again, but the margin to Indurain stayed the same. Rominger did {{jump to the}} fourth place in the general classification, because Erik Breukink lost almost ten minutes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop your noise!" [...] was all {{the answer}} he got. But {{presently}} our man <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> He drew himself to the gratings, grasping them with his hands, and looking out through them, sat waiting till the officer was passing once more, and then said: ...|$|R

2500|$|Coach Urban Meyer's fourth-ranked 2007 Florida Gators played host {{to coach}} Tommy Tuberville's unranked Auburn Tigers. [...] Tigers quarterback Brandon Cox led the Tigers to an early 17–3 lead, but Gators quarterback (and {{eventual}} Heisman Trophy winner) Tim Tebow and all-purpose back and receiver Percy Harvin led a comeback to tie it at 17. [...] The Tigers had one chance to win in regulation, as kicker Wes Byrum attempted a potentially game winning 45-yard field goal with four seconds left and nailed it. [...] But Meyer had called a timeout at the last possible moment to ice the kicker before the snap had taken place. So, after the timeout, Byrum had to <b>try</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> [...] After successfully making the field goal again as time expired to upset Florida 20–17, he taunted the Florida head coach and crowd with a few mock Gator chomps.|$|E
2500|$|Lucas rarely {{spoke to}} the actors, who felt that he {{expected}} too much of them while providing little direction. His directions to the actors usually consisted of the words [...] "faster" [...] and [...] "more intense". Kurtz stated that [...] "it happened a lot where he would just say, 'Let's <b>try</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> a little bit faster.' That was about the only instruction he'd give anybody. A lot of actors don't mind—they don't care, they just get on with it. But some actors really {{need a lot of}} pampering and a lot of feedback, and if they don't get it, they get paranoid that they might not be doing a good job." [...] Kurtz has said that Lucas [...] "wasn't gregarious, he's very much a loner and very shy, so he didn't like large groups of people, he didn't like working with a large crew, he didn't like working with a lot of actors." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the death}} of 5th {{district}} circuit judge Marlin L. Blackwell in 1955, Governor Earle C. Clements appointed the district's Commonwealth's attorney, Faust Y. Simpson, to the judgeship and Palmore as the new Commonwealth's attorney, possibly {{as a reward for}} supporting Clements' ally, Bert T. Combs, in the 1955 Democratic gubernatorial primary against Clements' factional foe, A. B. [...] "Happy" [...] Chandler. Palmore began his service on October 12, 1955, and was immediately tasked with prosecuting a high-profile murder case against Ben Charles Sitton, who was accused of killing police officer Jack Rainier during a traffic stop. The Fraternal Order of Police, concerned that Palmore's inexperience would result in Sitton's acquittal, asked Palmore to allow a more experienced attorney to try the case, but Palmore refused. On January 27, 1956, after just over three hours of deliberation, a jury returned a guilty verdict against Sitton and recommended a death sentence. The verdict was overturned on a technicality, and Palmore was forced to <b>try</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> winning a second conviction on June 29, 1956; the second jury recommended a sentence of life imprisonment.|$|E

6000|$|Yes, she {{was glad}} {{that she had made}} the experiment--but gladder that she was safely in from the long dust-whitened way, back in her own world of beauty; and she couldn't imagine ever <b>trying</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> To think of {{clumping}} out into that world of deliberate and brawling crudeness---- ...|$|R
50|$|One {{principle}} {{was established}} later: not to speculate. The First Opium War {{broke out in}} 1839 and Samuel made a huge profit from tea. When the war ended in 1842, the price of tea plummeted and he lost <b>it</b> all <b>again.</b> He never <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> avoiding all the triumphs and disasters of the later railway mania.|$|R

60|$|There was a {{sounding}} thud on the deck, {{followed by}} a sharp gasp, and the boy sat staring before him, considering, apparently, whether it were necessary or not to cry in order to relieve his feelings.

5000|$|Speaking in 1999, Hawke {{said of his}} victory: [...] "It {{just all}} {{happened}} so quickly with Seagram that I couldn't really appreciate it. You never catch up with yourself.
