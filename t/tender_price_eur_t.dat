The aim of this thesis is a detailed analysis of the concept of abnormally low <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> {{with regard to}} the case law of administrative courts and the Office for the Protection of Competition. The analysis is made both in relation to the Public Procurement act and the EU Directive on public procurement. After an introductory part the thesis is divided into seven main chapters. The first chapter outlines basic terms necessary for comprehensive analysis of further discussed issues. Chapter two deals with the concept of abnormally low <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> including its evolution in the former public procurement law. The third chapter focuses on the process of assessment of the tenders concerning the abnormally low <b>tender</b> <b>price.</b> This chapter deals with the request for explanation of the tenderer's <b>tender</b> <b>price,</b> with requirements of this explanation and with assessment of this explanation made by evaluation committee.

The first part presents the fundamentals of the <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> determination for construction works and summarizes the costs appearing while achieving the desired business performance. The practical part shows the <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> for a selected residential building. The building is first presented and described. The dimensions, determined {{on the basis of}} the plans, from the basis for the preparation of the bill of quantities. The procedure for obtaining the <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> for a selected single item is shown for the case of the building wall with thickness of 20 cm, built with modular bricks and lime mortar cement. The calculation of unit prices for key materials (supplied to the site), internal transportation, wet mixes and depreciation is presented. The determination and key analysis of the total price is carried out by using the obtained results.

40|$|Reliable short‐ to medium‐term {{prediction}} of the <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> index (TPI) {{is crucial to}} construction stakeholders, and this has stimulated {{the interest of the}} research community to seek a more analytical method for TPI forecast. The {{purpose of this study is}} to establish an econometric model for accurately predicting the <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> movements based on a group of associated financial and macroeconomic variables. Applying Johansen’s method for multivariate cointegration analysis, the <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> was found to be cointegrated with the gross domestic product, construction output and building cost. A vector error correction (VEC) model imposing the cointegration restriction was then developed for the purpose of forecasting. The model was verified against various diagnostic statistical criteria and compared with the Box‐Jenkins and regression models. With a mean absolute percentage error for a three‐year ahead forecast at 2. 9 % level, the developed VEC model outperforms the Box‐Jenkins and regression models, and is proven to be efficient and reliable in forecasting the short‐ to medium‐term <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> movements. The model can assist estimators to predict the TPI pattern in advance, and it can also help the public sector in planning for the construction workload to improve the stability of the construction market. Although the VEC model developed focuses on the Hong Kong construction market, the econometric technique can be applied to modelling other economic variables.

40|$|The {{focal point}} {{of this study was}} to assess the {{perspectives}} of construction professionals on factors influencing <b>tender</b> <b>prices</b> of construction works and the contribution of the factors to the success rate of contractors. Using literature review and questionnaire survey, 15 factors were identified in respect to contractors' <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> and success rate in Nigeria. The findings of this study based on the results of statistical analyses (mean score and chi-square) reveal that all the construction professionals (architects, builders, engineers and quantity surveyors) are of the opinion that material availability, labour productivity and level of profit are the most significant factors that highly influence <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> of construction works and consequently affect the success rate of contractors in competitive bidding. Project definition and construction plan have least influence on contractors' <b>tender</b> <b>price.</b> Also, it was found that government policy does not have significant effect on contractors' success rate in competitive bidding in Nigeria. It is hoped that the information presented in this paper will be of interest to all parties concerned, including Nigerian construction companies and foreign companies planning to enter the Nigerian construction market. In addition, while the research focused on a particular country, Nigeria, the study can be replicated in other countries particularly developing countries and the results can be compared.

40|$|Abstract: An {{important}} {{process in}} the procurement of infrastructure is tendering. Tendering involves invitation to submit tender by clients or their representative, submission of required documents by contractors and selection of appropriate contractors to execute the project. This study examines important constituents of <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> submitted by a contractor and factors affecting their <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> in Nigeria {{with a view to}} improving their competitiveness and success rate locally and internationally. Using quantitative design approach, data were obtained through questionnaires administered on registered construction professionals and contracting firms with adequate practicing experience. Prior to the study, pilot study was carried out to ensure proper validity and reliability of the instrument. From the final survey, there is no significance difference in the significance, importance and level of contractors' awareness of constituents of <b>tender</b> <b>price.</b> This implies that contractors are conversant of important elements of their <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> but the major factors affecting this price are related to incorrect/incomplete design as well as buildability and technicality associated the project. These factors are more of project characteristics than that of stakeholders and external variables. In view of this, nature and size of projects should be considered as major factors in estimating tender figure of construction projects by contractors. More so, for the contractors to remain in construction business, {{there is a need for}} training, innovation and advancement in the use of new and modern technology...|$|R

However, according to the UK future energy plan, with a high penetration of renewable energy sources, battery technologies have become increasingly attractive to provide firm frequency response (FFR).

Reliable forecast of construction cost is useful in mitigating the adverse effect of its fluctuation, however the availability of data for the development of multivariate models for construction cost forecasting remains a challenge. The study seeks to investigate the reliability of using univariate models for <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> index forecasting.

In addition, the neural network model provides a reliable forecast of <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> index over a period of 12 quarters ahead. The limitations of using the univariate models are elaborated.

Out of 60 factors identified, the availability of required cash, uncertainty in costs estimates, urgent need for work, past experience in similar projects and contract size are considered most important. The need for work and the amount of experience are similar to those factors affecting bidding decisions of top UK contractors. The findings suggest that in the upward adjustment of <b>tender</b> <b>prices,</b> the large‐size contractors are more concerned with the uncertainty in costs estimates while the medium‐ and small‐size contractors care more about no past experience. In the downward adjustment of prices, the large size of the contract is the main factor affecting the pricing of the large‐ and medium‐size contractors while the urgent need for work is the main drive for the small‐size ones. There are significant differences between the contractors' perceptions {{of the importance of the}} risk factors. This is consistent with differing attitudes towards bid mark‐up decisions of the large‐ and medium‐size contractors in Singapore. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R
