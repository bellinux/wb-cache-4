Niccolò {{and his brother}} Maffeo set off on a <b>trading</b> <b>voyage</b> before Marco's birth. In 1260, Niccolò and Maffeo, while residing in Constantinople, then {{the capital of the}} Latin Empire, foresaw a political change; they liquidated their assets into jewels and moved away. According to The Travels of Marco Polo, they passed through much of Asia, and met with Kublai Khan, a Mongol ruler and founder of the Yuan dynasty. Their decision to leave Constantinople proved timely. In 1261 Michael VIII Palaiologos, the ruler of the Empire of Nicaea, took Constantinople, promptly burned the Venetian quarter and re-established the Eastern Roman Empire. Captured Venetian citizens were blinded, while many of those who managed to escape perished aboard overloaded refugee ships fleeing to other Venetian colonies in the Aegean Sea.|$|E

Upon their return, French officials confiscated the furs of these unlicensed coureurs des bois. Radisson and Groseilliers went to Boston and then to London to secure funding and two ships to explore the Hudson Bay.

There, the Columbia was repaired before sailing for the northwest coast. Meanwhile, Gray reached the coast in August. Upon reaching the coast, Gray ran aground attempting to enter a river near 46°N latitude.

500|$|The poem {{consists}} of an address by the speaker to an unnamed listener, and contains two parallel sections, about two of Sappho's brothers, Charaxos and Larichos.

[...] In the first surviving stanza of the poem, the speaker upbraids the addressee for repeating that Charaxos will return home safely, saying that only the gods can know such a thing. [...] In the next stanza, the speaker tells the addressee to send her to pray to Hera for Charaxos' safe return. [...] This is followed by an exhortation to trust in the gods for everything else, and two traditional pieces of wisdom – that fortunes are changeable, and that the gods can bless those they favour with good fortune. [...] The poem ends with the speaker hoping that Larichos will [...] " [...] his head high" [...] and [...] "become an ανερ [...] in all senses", as Obbink puts it.|$|E

However, the expedition was still some way off and in the meantime, Worsley set up a shipping company with his friend Stenhouse. The company, Stenhouse Worsley & Co, purchased a schooner, Annie, {{with the intention of}} trading with the Baltic states. [...] This plan collapsed when the Baltic freight market fell on hard times and eventually, the company started shipping freight along the British coast. In late 1920, Worsley and Stenhouse went on a <b>trading</b> <b>voyage</b> to Iceland. The Annie carried cargo on the outward trip but was nearly wrecked when sailing around the coast of Iceland to pick up cargo from a remote port for the return trip to England. Poor weather and sea conditions kept the Annie in Iceland until February 1921, when Worsley was able to carry freight back to Britain. By then Shackleton was ready to proceed with his expedition and wanted Worsley as the captain of his ship, the Quest, an offer which he quickly accepted.|$|E
