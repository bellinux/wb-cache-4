40|$|Euro 5 / 6 {{light-duty}} vehicle emissions regulation introduced non-volatile {{particle number}} emission measurements. The particle number measurement system {{consists of a}} volatile removal unit followed by a particle number counter with a 50 % cut-point diameter at 23 nm. The volatile removal unit must achieve a > 99 % concentration reduction of a monodisperse aerosol of <b>tetracontane</b> (CH 3 (CH 2) 38 CH 3) particles of diameter = 30 nm with inlet concentration = 104 cm- 3. In this paper the evaporation of <b>tetracontane</b> particles in the volatile removal unit is investigated theoretically. The temperature and the residence time in the evaporation tube are discussed, {{as well as the}} possibility of nucleation events of evaporated particles at the exit of the evaporation tube. In addition, sulfuric acid nucleation at the evaporation tube exit is analyzed. Theoretical calculations are, finally, compared to experimental data. Our main conclusion is that the volatile removal efficiency requirements of the legislation can be easily met. However, as some experimental measurements showed, the removal efficiency might differ for large particle sizes and high concentrations; thus, the results of particle number counters with a 50 % cut-point diameter less than 23 nm should be interpreted with care.

40|$|Adjusting the free-electron concentration, {{the surface}} plasmon {{frequency}} of the semiconductor ZnOGa is tuned into resonance with the molecular vibrations of the n-alkane <b>tetracontane.</b> Closed molecular films deposited on the semiconductor's surface in the monolayer regime generate distinct signatures in total-attenuated-reflection spectra at the frequencies of the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of the CH 2 group. Their line shape undergoes profound changes from absorptive to dispersive and even anti-resonance behavior when moving along the surface- plasmon dispersion by the angel of incidence. We demonstrate that this line shape diversity results from a phase-sensitive perturbation of the surface-plasmon-polariton generation at the molecule/metal interface...|$|E
40|$|An {{extended}} hard-sphere {{model is}} presented that can accurately and reliably predict the viscosity of long chain n-alkanes. The method {{is based on}} the hard-sphere model of Dymond and Assael, that makes use of an universal function relating reduced viscosity to reduced volume. The existing expression for the molar core volume is extrapolated to long chain n-alkanes, while the roughness factor is determined from experimental data. A new correlation for roughness factor is developed that allows the extended model to reproduce the available experimental viscosity data on long chain n-alkanes up to <b>tetracontane</b> (n-C 40 H 82) within ? 5 %, at pressure up to 30 MPa.

The study also investigated possibilities to verify the linearity of CPCs against an electrometer in the sub 2000 #/cm 3 concentration range. The use of elevated sample flowrates and multiply charged particles of well defined charge status, allowed for some linearity checks down to 300 #/cm 3 concentration levels. JRC.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{chemical}} composition of aerosol particles on the counting efficiency of a TSI 3790 condensation particle counter (CPC) was theoretically and experimentally investigated.

40|$|Light duty vehicle {{emissions}} legislation requires calibration (by manufacturers) and validations (by test laboratories) of Condensation Particle Counters (CPCs) {{that will}} be used for measurements of vehicle particle number emissions. A workshop was organized at the Joint Research Centre (JRC) to study the effect of test aerosol materials (of their chemical composition) on CPC calibration and validation. The results showed that the counting efficiencies of Combustion Aerosol STandard (CAST) particles at 23 nm were similar to those of heavy duty diesel engine particles, while those of Emery oil were similar or slightly higher. The counting efficiencies of C 40 (<b>tetracontane)</b> particles were much higher, and those of NaCl particles were lower. The C 40 and NaCl results were not reproducible as tests at the JRC performed after the workshop found much lower counting efficiencies for C 40 particles and variable results for NaCl, depending on their thermal treatment. Measurement issues including calibration against an electrometer or a reference CPC, multiply charged particle effect on counting efficiencies, stability, repeatability, reproducibility of the tests, and comparability of electrometers of different manufacturers were also investigated..

The methanol extract contained the highest total phenolic (94. 37 ± 1. 24 [*]mg[*]GAE/g) and flavonoid contents (26. 90 ± 1. 35 [*]mg[*]RE/g) and exhibited the highest DPPH scavenging activity (90. 13 ± 3. 32 %) {{followed by the}} acetone extract (80. 23 ± 3. 26 %) at 500 [*]μg/mL concentration. Similarly, the highest ferric ion reduction potential (849. 63 ± 30. 95 [*]μM of Fe (II) /g dry weight) was exhibited by the methanol extract followed by the acetone extract (695. 92 ± 25. 44 [*]μM of Fe (II) /g dry weight). The methanol extract showed greater antimicrobial activity against all the tested pathogens (Bacillus subtilis, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans). However, both hexane and acetone extracts failed to inhibit E. coli. S. aureus and C. albicans were more susceptible to all the extracts. Further, GC-MS analysis confirmed the occurrence of a total 46 phytocompounds in different solvent extracts. Some of the major compounds included carvacrol (37. 7 %), <b>tetracontane</b> (16. 6 %), squalene (15. 6 %), tetrapentacontane (13. 7 %), and Phytol (12. 9 %).

40|$|Acinetobacter sp. strain DSM 17874 {{is capable}} of {{utilizing}} n-alkanes with chain lengths ranging from that of decane (C 10 H 22) to that of <b>tetracontane</b> (C 40 H 82) as a sole carbon source. Two genes encoding AlkB-type alkane hydroxylase homologues, designated alkMa and alkMb, {{have been shown to}} be involved in the degradation of n-alkanes with chain lengths of from 10 to 20 C atoms in this strain. Here, we describe a novel high-throughput screening method and the screening of a transposon mutant library to identify genes involved in the degradation of n-alkanes with C chain lengths longer than 20, which are solid at 30 °C, the optimal growth temperature for Acinetobacter sp. strain DSM 17874. A library consisting of approximately 6, 800 Acinetobacter sp. strain DSM 17874 transposon mutants was constructed and screened for mutants unable to grow on dotriacontane (C 32 H 66) while simultaneously showing wild-type growth characteristics on shorter-chain n-alkanes. For 23 such mutants isolated, the genes inactivated by transposon insertion were identified. Targeted inactivation and complementation studies of one of these genes, designated almA and encoding a putative flavin-binding monooxygenase, confirmed its involvement in the strain's metabolism of long-chain n-alkanes. To our knowledge, almA represents the first cloned gene shown to be involved in the bacterial degradation of long-chain n-alkanes of 32 C's and longer. Genes encoding AlmA homologues were also identified in other long-chain n-alkane-degrading Acinetobacter strains...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{particle}} chemical composition on the counting efficiency of a commercially available n-butanol condensation particle counter (CPC) was theoretically investigated. The activation probability of particles soluble in n-butanol or {{covered by a}} soluble coating was determined by Köhler theory, whereas the activation of insoluble particles was determined by heterogeneous nucleation theory. The theoretically predicted counting efficiencies were fit to experimental data to infer the n-butanol microscopic contact angle on insoluble particles or the volume of a soluble layer coating the particle. The calculated microscopic contact angles were found to depend on particle chemical composition, particle diameter, and the CPC saturator-to-condenser temperature difference. For counting efficiencies close to unity (large particle diameters) the contact angle approached a constant value independent of chemical composition and determined by the CPC operating temperature difference. The average n-butanol microscopic contact angle on diesel exhaust and CAST soot {{was determined to be}} 5 - 10 °, on uncontaminated Emery oil particle 10 °, on thermally pretreated <b>tetracontane</b> () particles 25 °, and on dry sodium chloride particles 15 - 20 ° for CPCs operated at a temperature difference of approximately 7 ºC (low saturation ratios). The counting efficiencies were very sensitive to particle contamination, as determined by the particle generation method and treatment, an effect that could be reproduced by modified Köhler theory, and the particle chemical composition dependence became stronger at lower CPC temperature differences.

40|$|Measurement of {{particle}} number {{was introduced in}} the Euro 5 / 6 light duty vehicle emissions regulation. Although particle number measurement systems have to be calibrated by the manufacturers, labs have to validate the proper operation of their systems within one year of the emissions test. The systems must achieve a > 99 % reduction of an aerosol containing 30 nm <b>tetracontane</b> (CH 3 (CH 2) 38 CH 3) particles (C 40) with an inlet concentration > 104 #/cm 3. They must also include an initial heated dilution stage with dilution of at least 10 which outputs a diluted sample at a temperature of 150 °C- 400 °C. The system as a whole must achieve a particle number concentration reduction factor for particles of 30 nm and 50 nm electrical mobility diameters, that is no more than 30 % and 20 % respectively higher, and no more than 5 % lower than that for particles of 100 nm. In this paper the terms dilution factor, penetration, losses, particle number concentration reduction factor and volatile removal efficiency are defined. Then, various commercial instruments, like the Solid Particle Counter (SPCS) from Horiba, the NanoMet-C from Matter Eng., the ejector diluter and the thermodenuder from Dekati are characterized. The penetrations, the particle number concentration reduction factors and the volatile removal efficiency of the above systems are discussed and compared with the legislation requirements. Finally, some calibration/validation issues are discussed, like the effect of the under-pressure downstream of the electrostatic classifier and the use of one or two particle number counters for the calibration. The importance of a stable at high temperatures aerosol is also pointed out. It is also shown that the systems can be checked using polydisperse aerosol but still many parameters need to be considered (e. g. concentration range, pressure upstream and downstream of the systems). Till more experience is gained, labs are highly recommended to use simple gas dilution factors to check their systems. JRC. H. 4 -Transport and air qualit...|$|E
