His wife, who also fell ill and was {{pregnant}} with the couple's sixth child, was so depressed because of his death and her subsequent financial straits that she suffered a miscarriage. She and the children moved in with Cabell's widowed mother at Cabell's Dale. For several years, she was dependent upon her in-laws for survival; Breckinridge's brother, Robert, assumed Cabell's debts, which he paid in full in 1832.|$|E

The Dutch had had important business interests in the country, especially in petroleum. Muller stayed here until early 1924 when he was appointed envoy to Czechoslovakia. In Prague he was also involved in Dutch business affairs, inter alia looking after the interests of the Dutch electrotechnical firm Philips.|$|E

5|$|The commotion {{caused by}} the stoor worm's writhing agonies draws a crowd to the beach, and Assipattle lands safely among them. The ferocity of the fire burning in the creature's liver increases, causing smoke clouds to be {{expelled}} from its mouth and nostrils, turning the skies black. The islanders, believing {{that the world is}} about to end, clamber up a hillside to watch the final death <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> the creature at a safe distance from the resulting tidal waves and earthquakes. As it dies, the creature's teeth fall out to become the islands of Orkney, Shetland and the Faroes. The Baltic Sea is created where its tongue falls out, and when the creature finally curls up into a tight knot and dies, its body becomes Iceland. True to his word, once the skies clear and the earth settles, the king relinquishes his kingdom to Assipattle, who marries Princess Gem-de-lovely. As promised, the king also gives Odin's magic sword to Assipattle.|$|E

40|$|An instrument, {{adding the}} {{capability}} to measure 3 D volumetric chemical composition, has been constructed by me {{as a member of}} the Sánchez Nano Laboratory. The laboratory 2 ̆ 7 s in situ atomic force microscope (AFM) and secondary ion mass spectrometry systems (SIMS) are functional and integrated as one instrument. The SIMS utilizes a Ga focused ion beam (FIB) combined with a quadrupole mass analyzer. The AFM is comprised of a 6 -axis stage, three coarse axes and three fine. The coarse stage is used for placing the AFM tip anywhere inside a (13 x 13 x 5 mm 3) (xyz) volume. Thus the tip can be moved in and out of the FIB processing region with ease. The planned range for the Z-axis piezo was 60 µm, but was reduced after it was damaged from arc events. The repaired Z-axis piezo is now operated at a smaller nominal range of 18 µm (16. 7 µm after pre-loading), still quite respectable for an AFM. The noise floor of the AFM is approximately 0. 4 nm Rq. The voxel size for the combined instrument is targeted at 50 nm or larger. Thus 0. 4 nm of xyz uncertainty is acceptable. The instrument has been used for analyzing samples using FIB beam currents of 250 pA and 5. 75 nA. Coarse tip approaches can take a long time so an abbreviated technique is employed. Because of the relatively long <b>thro</b> <b>of</b> the Z piezo, the tip can be disengaged by deactivating the servo PID. Once disengaged, it can be moved laterally out of the way of the FIB-SIMS using the coarse stage. This instrument has been used to acquire volumetric data on AlTiC using AFM tip diameters of 18. 9 nm and 30. 6 nm. Acquisition times are very long, requiring multiple days to acquire a 50 -image stack. New features to be added include auto stigmation, auto beam shift, more software automation, etc. Longer term upgrades to include a new lower voltage Z-piezo with strain-gauge feedback and a new design to extend the life for the coarse XY nano-positioners. This AFM-SIMS instrument, as constructed, has proven to be a great proof of concept vehicle. In the future it will be used to analyze micro fossils and it will also be used as a part of an intensive teaching curriculum...|$|R

25|$|In the Victorian period, {{the quality}} of erotic fiction was much below that of the {{previous}} century—it was largely written by 'hacks'.
