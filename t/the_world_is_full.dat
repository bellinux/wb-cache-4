25|$|The song Hop Hop has {{political}} tones. It {{describes how}} the states exploit the citizens for their own purposes, how today's political systems are good for nothing, since <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of violence, war, human rights are many times oppressed, we are a subject to global warming and governments do little to save us. Tarkan explained in the interview that the song examines these problems and encourages people to unite, no matter what color our skin is or what religion we follow.|$|E
25|$|After the {{introduction}} come {{the words of}} Kohelet. As king he has experienced everything and done everything, but nothing is ultimately reliable. Death levels all. The only good is to partake {{of life in the}} present, for enjoyment is from the hand of God. Everything is ordered in time and people are subject to time in contrast to God's eternal character. The world is filled with injustice, which only God will adjudicate. God and humans do not belong in the same realm and it is therefore necessary to have a right attitude before God. People should enjoy, but should not be greedy; no-one knows what is good for humanity; righteousness and wisdom escape us. Kohelet reflects on the limits of human power: all people face death, and death is better than life, but we should enjoy life when we can. <b>The</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of risk: he gives advice on living with risk, both political and economic. Mortals should take pleasure when they can, for a time may come when no one can. Kohelet's words finish with imagery of nature languishing and humanity marching to the grave.|$|E

2500|$|This story echoes Mildred's [...] "Seashell ear-thimbles" [...] (i.e., a {{brand of}} in-ear headphones) that act as an {{emotional}} barrier between her and Montag. In a 2007 interview, Bradbury maintained that people misinterpret his book and that Fahrenheit 451 is really a statement on how mass media like television marginalizes the reading of literature. Regarding minorities, {{he wrote in his}} 1979 Coda:There is {{more than one way to}} burn a book. And <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of people running about with lit matches. Every minority, be it Baptist/Unitarian, Irish/Italian/Octogenarian/Zen Buddhist, Zionist/Seventh-day Adventist, Women's Lib/Republican, Mattachine/Four Square Gospel feels it has the will, the right, the duty to douse the kerosene, light the fuse. Fire-Captain Beatty, in my novel Fahrenheit 451, described how the books were burned first by minorities, each ripping a page or a paragraph from this book, then that, until the day came when the books were empty and the minds shut and the libraries closed forever. Only six weeks ago, I discovered that, over the years, some cubby-hole editors at Ballantine Books, fearful of contaminating the young, had, bit by bit, censored some seventy-five separate sections from the novel. Students, reading the novel, which, after all, deals with censorship and book-burning in the future, wrote to tell me of this exquisite irony. Judy-Lynn del Rey, one of the new Ballantine editors, is having the entire book reset and republished this summer with all the damns and hells back in place.|$|E
2500|$|I compare {{human life}} to a large Mansion of Many Apartments, two of which I can only describe, {{the doors of the}} rest being as yet shut upon me—The first we step into we call the infant or thoughtless Chamber, in which we remain as long as we do not think—We remain there a long while, and {{notwithstanding}} the doors of the second Chamber remain wide open, showing a bright appearance, we care not to hasten to it; but are at length imperceptibly impelled by the awakening of the thinking principle—within us—we no sooner get into the second Chamber, which I shall call the Chamber of Maiden-Thought, than we become intoxicated with the light and the atmosphere, we see nothing but pleasant wonders, and think of delaying there for ever in delight: However among the effects this breathing is father of is that tremendous one of sharpening one's vision into the heart and nature of Man—of convincing ones nerves that <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of Misery and Heartbreak, Pain, Sickness, and oppression—whereby This Chamber of Maiden Thought becomes gradually darken'd {{and at the same time}} on all sides of it many doors are set open—but all dark—all leading to dark passages—We see not the balance of good and evil. [...] We are in a Mist—We are now in that state—We feel the 'burden of the Mystery,' To this point was Wordsworth come, as far as I can conceive when he wrote 'Tintern Abbey' and it seems to me that his Genius is explorative of those dark Passages. [...] Now if we live, and go on thinking, we too shall explore them. [...] he is a Genius and superior to us, in so far as he can, more than we, make discoveries, and shed a light in them—Here I must think Wordsworth is deeper than Milton ...|$|E
