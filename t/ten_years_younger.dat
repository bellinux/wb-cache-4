25|$|Originally it was {{intended}} that Tereshkova would launch first in Vostok 5 while Ponomaryova would follow her into orbit in Vostok 6. However, this flight plan was altered in March 1963. Vostok 5 would now carry a male cosmonaut Valery Bykovsky flying the joint mission with a woman aboard Vostok 6 in June 1963. The State Space Commission nominated Tereshkova to pilot Vostok 6 at their meeting on 21 May and this was confirmed by Nikita Khrushchev himself. Tereshkova was exactly <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>younger</b> than the youngest Mercury Seven astronaut, Gordon Cooper.|$|E
25|$|De Silva was in {{many ways}} unlucky - when Sri Lanka was finally awarded Test status, he was nearing his forties, which {{naturally}} shortened his career. However, he played all the first 12 Tests that Sri Lanka played, before retiring at 42. Had he been <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>younger,</b> he would perhaps have been more recognised as Sri Lanka's first genuine all-rounder - that title instead went to Ravi Ratnayeke. De Silva also played minor county cricket for Lincolnshire and Shropshire, and later became a coach of the Sri Lankan cricket team. He is currently the interim chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket.|$|E

25|$|Keyes brings Jackson to Los Angeles, suspecting {{that the}} man aboard the train had not been Dietrichson, but rather had been Phyllis' {{accomplice}} in Dietrichson's murder. After examining photographs of Dietrichson, Jackson is sure {{that the man}} he met was not that old, but at least <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>younger.</b> Now certain that he can prove murder, Keyes is eager to reject the claim and force Phyllis to sue. Neff warns Phyllis not to pursue the insurance claim in court and admits {{that he has been}} talking to Lola about her past. Phyllis, however, insists on filing suit to pursue the claim despite the risk to both her and Neff. Lola eventually tells Neff that she has discovered that her boyfriend, the hotheaded Nino Zachetti (Byron Barr), has been seeing Phyllis behind her (and Neff's) back.|$|E
25|$|Lin {{was born}} and raised in Taipei, Taiwan, the eldest of four children, having one brother a year younger the other, six years younger, and a half-sister, <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>younger,</b> from her father's second marriage.

She graduated from Ri Xin Primary School and Zhong Dian High School. Lin originally planned on going to the United Kingdom to study after high school graduation, never considering the prospect of an acting career. However, she began her acting career at age seventeen as a part-time model. Her first TV commercial was for Jasmine Tea in 1994.|$|E

500|$|Teri Hatcher {{was three}} months {{pregnant}} when shooting started, although her publicist stated the pregnancy {{did not affect the}} production schedule. Hatcher later regretted playing Paris Carver, saying [...] "It's such an artificial kind of character to be playing that you don't get any special satisfaction from it." [...] Actress Sela Ward auditioned for the role, but lost out, reportedly being told the producers wanted her, but <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>younger.</b> Hatcher was seven years Ward's junior. According to Brosnan, Monica Bellucci also screen tested for the role but as Brosnan remarked, [...] "the fools said no."

Bellucci would later go on {{to play a role in}} the 24th Bond film, Spectre.|$|E

50|$|Shortly thereafter, {{he made a}} {{break with}} his Soviet {{expectant}} home and went into exile, first travelling to London and then in 1921 to Germany. In the spring of the same year, Peter Novopashenny became acquainted with the <b>ten</b> <b>year</b> <b>younger</b> German, Wilhelm Fenner, {{who was born in}} Saint Petersburg, Russia and who was also fluent in the Russian language. The two immediately hit it off. Novopashenny asked Fenner to help with the planned move to Berlin and confided to him that he successfully worked during the war as director of the Russian cryptanalytic service, breaking the ciphers of the German Baltic Fleet and he intended to provide his experiences to the German General Staff. That same year, he offered a course in cryptology and cryptanalysis to Wilhelm Fenner. Novopashenny worked diligently, often late into the night and after some weeks was successful; the cipher of the current Russian Military Attache was solved by Fenner.|$|R

[...] Wheatley's stepfather {{died of a heart}} attack when he was 13, leaving behind Wheatley, his sister, and half-brother, two-year-old Leslie Mongo. [...] Shortly afterward, Wheatley's mother, Patricia, was laid off and became an alcoholic. With the effective loss of his two parents, Wheatley and his sister were forced to move in with an aunt, where he lived through the rest of his childhood. [...] Due to family difficulties, Wheatley acts as the guardian of two cousins and his half brother. Mongo was <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>younger</b> than Wheatley, and graduated from high school in New Jersey in 2004—thirteen years after Wheatley had graduated from high school.|$|E
500|$|Edward Michael Stelmach {{was born}} on a farm near Lamont, Alberta, the {{grandson}} of immigrants from , Ukraine. His grandparents settled near Andrew, Alberta in 1898, after bypassing Saskatchewan {{because they did not}} care for the terrain. His parents, Nancy (née Koroluk) and Michael N. Stelmach, had five children, of whom Edward was the youngest, <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>younger</b> than his closest sibling. He was raised a Ukrainian Catholic, and continues to attend church regularly, sing in the church choir, and act as volunteer caretaker for the cemetery. [...] Through high school, he worked as a well-digger and a Fuller Brush salesman, where he said his grasp of Ukrainian helped him make sales. After graduating high school—his grade 12 yearbook called him a future Prime Minister of Canada—he attended the University of Alberta, intending to become a lawyer. He continued there, working as an assistant manager at Woodward's, until 1973, when his oldest brother, Victor, died. [...] While his family had intended for Victor to take over the farm that his grandparents had settled 75 years before, Stelmach dropped out of university, returned home, and bought the land from his parents. He continues to farm the land today.|$|E
500|$|Anne's {{father was}} soon {{appointed}} curate (deputy vicar) of Saint Wilfrid's, {{the local church}} in Alford, and in 1585 he also became the schoolmaster at the Alford Free Grammar School, one of many such public schools, free {{to the poor and}} begun by Queen Elizabeth. About this time, Marbury married his first wife Elizabeth Moore, who bore three children, then died. [...] Within a year of his first wife's death, Marbury married Bridget Dryden, about <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>younger</b> than he and from a prominent Northampton family. [...] Bridget's brother Erasmus was the grandfather of John Dryden, the famous playwright and Poet Laureate. [...] Anne was the third of 15 children born to this marriage, 12 of whom survived early childhood. The Marburys lived in Alford for the first 15 years of Anne's life, and she received a better education than most girls of her time, with her father's strong commitment to learning, and she also became intimately familiar with scripture and Christian tenets. Education at that time was almost exclusively offered to boys and men. One possible reason why Marbury taught his daughters may have been that six of his first seven children were girls. Another reason may have been that the ruling class in Elizabethan England began realising that girls could be schooled, looking to the example of the queen, who spoke six foreign languages.|$|E
