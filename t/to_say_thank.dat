5|$|On December 15, 2015, Heyward {{signed an}} eight-year, $184 million {{contract}} with the Cubs. One of his first acts after signing his contract was to pay for hotel suites {{large enough to accommodate}} teammate David Ross, his wife, and their three young children on all of the Cubs' road trips during the 2016 season. Ross, set to retire after the 2016 season, had been Heyward's teammate during his first three seasons in Atlanta, and Heyward considered him a key mentor in his early MLB career. In an interview with the Bleacher Report website, Heyward said,I know how special it is to have teammates like he was my first three years in Atlanta. You don't take it for granted. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>thank</b> you {{from the bottom of my}} heart, as a teammate and as a friend, for what he's done for me.|$|E
500|$|The {{illustrated}} book of The Hockey Sweater {{was among}} the children's books included as official Canadian gifts presented to the Prince of Wales and his family during an official visit in 1991, for his then nine-year-old son William. Canadian astronaut Robert Thirsk, {{as part of a}} personal tradition of honouring others, brought a copy of the story to space when he travelled to the International Space Station in 2009 and later presented the copy to Carrier. Of the story, Thirsk said: [...] "It represents part of Canadian literacy, it represents support of reading and I just wanted <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>thank</b> you to Mr. Carrier." [...] The story has also been set to music by composer Abigail Richardson-Schulte as part of a piece commissioned by the Toronto Symphony, the Calgary Philharmonic and National Arts Centre Orchestras in 2012.|$|E
500|$|On the {{following}} episode of Raw, Ric Flair made his farewell speech, {{which led to}} Triple H introducing various people from Flair's past, such as the Four Horsemen, Ricky Steamboat, and others, each coming out to give an emotional farewell. Afterward, the entire WWE roster came out <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>thank</b> you to Flair (Including Undertaker, who came out after Raw went off the air and hugged Flair and did his kneeling stance). Shawn Michaels, who was clearly upset about retiring Flair, was forgiven by Flair. Despite Flair's forgiveness, his former protégé Batista later started a feud with Michaels, citing Michaels' [...] "selfishness" [...] at WrestleMania for not lying down for Flair. The two had a match booked at Backlash, WWE's next scheduled pay-per-view event, and after a confrontation between Michaels and Chris Jericho, Jericho was later added into the match as a Special Guest Referee. Michaels won with a superkick.|$|E

I never forget that {{on the first day}} of my arrival in Rome, after the first lecture of the course Distributed Systems, I came over your office and said to you that I am interested in joining your research group to do research. Although you knew that I had no enough knowledge at the time to start researching with your team, you tried to keep me eager and motivated, and said to me that I join your research group in the second semester when I finished my core courses. Briefly, I would like <b>to</b> <b>say</b> again <b>Thank</b> You for everything you taught me in doing research. Second, I would like <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>Thanks</b> <b>to</b> Dr. Silvia Bonomi who is a kind person and great researcher. I learned the basics of doing research from you by asking so many questions, and you were always nice and helpful. I never forget your helps and Thank You again! Finally, I would like to dedicate this work to my parents. Even though over the last two years, I have not visited you many times, I always felt you...|$|R
500|$|The song {{opens with}} Fantasia's testimony: [...] "Listen, I done {{made it through}} the storm and the rain / So much heartache, pressure, so much pain / I been broken in two pieces, maybe more / And some nights I made my bed right on the floor." [...] The lyrics contain direct {{references}} to Christianity, with Fantasia singing: [...] "Thank you for never leaving me Lord Jesus!". She continues to express her gratitude with the lyrics: [...] "You're the only one that never left me when everyone else just didn't care, you're the only one that really loved me. I made it. I {{made it through the}} storm." [...] She describes having a close relationship and faith in religion by singing: [...] "I got <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>thank</b> you Lord for keeping me, for grace and mercy. I thank you, because I made it!"

500|$|When Vanessa Villante (Alin Sumarwata) {{moves into}} Ramsay Street, she {{immediately}} catches Rhys' eye. He later treats {{her when she}} is admitted to hospital with severe morning sickness. Rhys believes {{the father of her}} child, Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major), is not [...] "pulling his weight" [...] and he starts looking out for her. Rhys helps Vanessa lift some heavy boxes and she offers to show him how to bake a cake <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>thank</b> you. A columinst for All About Soap observed [...] "While Vanessa sees it as mates having fun, it's clear Rhys has got it bad!" [...] Rhys later returns {{to spend more time with}} Vanessa, which unnerves Lucas. Herbison commented that Rhys may have met his match in Vanessa, while Barber said her feistiness appeals to him. He stated [...] "He finds her attractive, and she takes the mickey out of him - that's good for Rhys. He needs to be knocked off his pedestal! Vanessa also exposes a rare vulnerability in Rhys, so there's a risk he could get hurt and lash out in other ways." ...|$|E
500|$|Fan {{reaction}} was largely positive, though certain fans {{complained that the}} game was a far departure from its predecessor, Chrono Trigger; Chrono Cross broke convention by featuring more characters, fewer double and triple techs, fewer instances of time travel, and few appearances of Trigger characters and locations. Producer Hiromichi Tanaka and director Masato Kato {{were aware of the}} changes in development, specifically intending to provide an experience different from Chrono Trigger. Kato anticipated and rebuffed this discontent before the game's release, wondering what the Chrono title meant to these fans and whether his messages ever [...] "really got through to them". He continued, [...] "Cross is undoubtedly the highest quality Chrono that we can create right now. (I won't say the 'best' Chrono, but) If you can't accept that, then I'm sorry to say this but I guess your Chrono and my Chrono have taken totally different paths. But I would like <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>thank</b> you for falling in love with Trigger so much." [...] Tanaka added, [...] "Of course, the fans of the original are very important, but what innovation can come about when you're bound to the past? I believe that gameplay should evolve with the hardware." ...|$|E

500|$|People {{are always}} {{using the word}} Illuminati but they're always {{referencing}} it in an incorrect way. People often accuse me of {{being a member of}} the Illuminati and I think in today's pop culture the Illuminati is perceived as a group of powerful, successful people who are working behind the scenes to control the universe. Not people with consciousness, not people who are enlightened. So people were accusing me of {{being a member of the}} Illuminati, and I kept going, wait—so first I had to figure out what that meant...I know who the real Illuminati are, and I know where that word comes from. The real Illuminati were a group of scientists, artists, philosophers, writers, who came about in what is referred to as the Age of Enlightenment, after the Dark Ages, when there was no writing and no art and no creativity and no spirituality, and life was really at a standstill. And right after that, everything flourished. So we had people like Shakespeare and Leonardo Da Vinci and Michaelangelo and Isaac Newton, and all these great minds and great thinkers, and they were called Illuminati...It had nothing to do with money and power. Of course they were powerful, because they influenced people. But their goal was to inspire and enlighten. So when people refer to me as a member of the Illuminati, I always want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>thank</b> you. Thank you for putting me in that category.|$|E

[...] He then names three of the main session musicians on Ringo – fellow drummer Jim Keltner, Voormann and keyboard player Nicky Hopkins – before similarly thanking Harrison, ex-Beatles John Lennon and Paul McCartney, producer Richard Perry, sound engineer Bill Schnee, and songwriter Vince Poncia.|$|E
2500|$|After {{starting}} qualification for UEFA Euro 2008 {{well with}} two wins, England hit a poor run of form between October 2006 and March 2007 {{with only one}} goal scored in five matches, by which time they had fallen to fourth in their qualification group. During a match against Andorra in March 2007, McClaren and the England team received abuse from supporters during a poor performance in a 3–0 win.

Starr spoke of the writing process {{in an interview with}} Billboard magazine: [...] "This is the first time I've really been involved [...] Whereas before, I'd just sort of pick out other people's songs or songs other people had written that I thought were vaguely trying to say what I would have liked to say, on this, we're really trying to say what I want <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>thank</b> you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Notwithstanding her oratory, Mendleson {{was convicted}} by a 10–2 {{majority}} of conspiracy to cause explosions.

2500|$|The DTM {{competitors}} {{returned to}} Brands, May 2013, where Mike Rockenfeller dominated with a lights-to-flag win, in his Audi RS5. The reigning champion, Bruno Spengler was second for BMW {{with his fellow}} Canadian, Robert Wickens taking third for Mercedes-Benz. However the DTM cars will not return in 2014, as the series expands into Eastern Europe and China. DTM chief, Hans Werner Aufrecht said that [...] "while Brands and Zandvoort had been good venues for the championship, Hungary and China were stronger markets". Meanwhile, Jonathan Palmer, head of Brands owner MotorSport Vision, said the decision to part with the DTM was a mutual one. [...] "We have enjoyed hosting DTM at Brands Hatch for eight years but we have agreed with ITR that it's time for the event to move on.

2500|$|We heard {{something}} was wrong with my dad during the [...] World Cup. He started feeling unwell and then, out of the blue, we were told he only had a few months to live. It was a huge shock because we've always been a very close family. I missed the first couple of Tests in England that year so I could be at home with him. It was obviously the saddest time of my life but those last weeks were maybe some of the most beautiful. It gave me a chance <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>thank</b> you and goodbye. After a while I realised how lucky I was to do that. It's far harder if a parent is taken away before you have that time together. So his death put cricket in perspective for me.

A moving image of O'Brien walking onto his Tonight set was displayed (for less than one second) in an on-air promo chronicling the franchise's history, and Fallon referenced the conflict on his first Tonight Show episode, {{when he opened the}} show by joking: “I'm Jimmy Fallon, and I'll be your host—for now.
