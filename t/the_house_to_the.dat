5|$|Now {{an escape}} seemed like Berkman's only option. The {{plan was to}} rent a {{house across the street}} from the prison and dig an {{underground}} tunnel from <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prison. Berkman had been given access to a large portion of the prison and had grown familiar with its layout. In April 1900, a house was leased. The tunnel would be dug from the cellar of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stable inside the prison yard. When the digging was complete, Berkman would sneak into the stable, tear open the wooden flooring, and crawl through the tunnel to the house.|$|E
5|$|Four two storey residences, Numbers 8, 10, 16 and 18 The Terrace, {{were built}} during the 1850s for officer accommodation. Number 8, {{also known as}} the Chaplain's House, is a two storey house with {{rendered}} and painted limestone walls. The plan is roughly square with verandahs and balconies along the west and south sides. A single storey building connects the south-east side of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main prison wall.|$|E
5|$|Perry Ellwood {{undertook}} major renovations which {{added and}} changed rooms in 1910. On the home's exterior the porte cochere was {{moved from the}} south facade to its present position on the north facade. On {{the south side of}} the home a large brick terrace was added and the conservatory moved from the southwest side of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear (west). The full-length tower on the home's southwest corner was entirely removed during this renovation.|$|E

5|$|Sir Ralph died in 1677, and {{his widow}} let <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Duke of Ormonde from 1686 and 1688. John Bankes the Elder regained the {{property}} in 1693, and with his wife Margaret, daughter of Sir Henry Parker of Honington Hall, completed most of his father's original development plan. In 1772 the house passed to his second son Henry who remodelled it, built a servants' wing, and enclosed the parkland for better agricultural management.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2006 election, Hastert {{expressed}} his intent to seek reelection as Speaker if the Republicans maintained {{control of the}} House. Hastert was reelected for an eleventh term to his seat in the House with nearly 60 percent of the vote, but that year the Republicans lost control of both the Senate and <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Democrats following a wave of voter discontent with the Iraq War, the Federal response to Hurricane Katrina, {{and a series of}} scandals among congressional Republicans. The day after the November election, Hastert announced he would not seek to become minority leader when the 110th Congress convened in January 2007. Later that month, John Boehner of Ohio defeated Mike Pence of Indiana in a 168-27 vote of the House Republican Conference election to become minority leader for the 110th Congress. The House Democratic Caucus unanimously selected House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to be Speaker (succeeding Hastert) for the 110th Congress.|$|E
5|$|The Acors Barns House {{has gone}} through several owners over its lifetime. In 1862, the house passed from Acors Barns to his son William H. Barns. In 1893, the second son, Charles Barns {{acquired}} the title {{to the house and}} transferred it upon his death to Harriet Barns Vincent, the daughter of his sister. Harriet Barns Vincent sold the house to Julia O'Sullivan in 1919. Francis McGuire purchased the house in 1956 and it would later pass to James McGuire. In 2013, James McGuire sold <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Community Foundation of Eastern Connecticut for $325,000. The foundation stated it would continue to preserve the house's historical integrity.|$|E

5|$|The Tudor mansion was {{dismantled}} but, {{concerned that}} the stone would swiftly disintegrate during the demolition phase, Weddell's advisers ordered that a small explosive device be triggered in {{the centre of the}} house and the undamaged stones salvaged. However, the explosion had the effect of splitting the walls intact meaning that much of the building could be salvaged and shipped to the United States. The first shipments arrived in Richmond, Virginia in early 1926, but they were soaked in seawater and had to be dried in a barn for up to six months. From the very beginning, the Weddells planned on deeding <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Virginia Historical Society and allocating the west wing of the structure as a museum once it was rebuilt in Virginia. The Weddells also intended the structure to become the society's new headquarters.|$|E
5|$|The chapel predates the {{existing}} house, having been built around 1343, and {{functioned as a}} chantry chapel, where masses could {{be said for the}} souls of the family, both living and dead. The great hall was added in the 15th century and the Oriel Room in the 16th. Various renovations were undertaken during the 16th and 17th centuries after which the house fell into disrepair with the north range being demolished by the early 19th century. In 1907 Sir Walter Jenner of the Jenner baronets bought the house and restored it in a period style, furnishing it with fine 17th century and 18th century oak furniture, antique tapestries and fabrics modelled after medieval textiles, along with historic and period paintings. On his death in 1948 he left <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> National Trust.|$|E

Two years later, in 1916, the Ottomans acquired the property.

25|$|The {{explicit}} psychological {{dimension of}} this tale has prompted many critics to analyze it as {{a description of}} the human psyche, comparing, for instance, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unconscious, and its central crack to a split personality. Mental disorder is also evoked through the themes of melancholy, possible incest, and vampirism. An incestuous relationship between Roderick and Madeline is never explicitly stated, but seems implied by the strange attachment between the two.|$|E
25|$|After {{that time}} the house grew neglected. It had had {{asbestos}} composite shingles placed over its clapboard siding and asphalt shingles on its roof. In the early 2000s its historic potential was recognized and it was restored in order to serve as home to the Irvington Historical Society. Con Ed sold <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> village. The work cost a half million dollars, and included a new roof, siding, windows, heating and plumbing.|$|E
