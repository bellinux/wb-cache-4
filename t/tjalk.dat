50|$|The Boelwerf {{was founded}} in 1829 by Bernard Boel (1798-1872), who {{had worked as a}} {{carpenter}} at the Antwerpen South shipyards. He was succeeded by his son Jozef Boel. During the first fifty years of its existence, the shipyard built wooden ships and employed a limited number of workers. The company built only one ship a year, mainly <b>tjalks.</b> Starting from 1900, the number of ships built, and with it the number of employees, grew steadily.|$|R
50|$|A skûtsje (pronounced 'skootshuh') is a Frisian {{sailing boat}} {{of the type}} <b>tjalk,</b> {{originally}} an ordinary cargo boat, but today a prized ship {{and one of the}} icons of Frisia. Skûtsjes were built from the 18th century until about 1930 and are 12 to 20 m long and on average 3.5 m wide, with a maximum of 4 m (based on the standard dimensions of Frisian bridges and locks).|$|E
5000|$|In Lelystad some streets have a {{combination}} of names and numbers. The streets with the same name (but different number) {{are in the same}} area. In Botter the names are Botter and <b>Tjalk,</b> in Galjoen the names are Galjoen and Jol, in Schouw the names are Schouw and Gondel, although there are [...] "normal" [...] names there, etc. There are also other cities with similar numbering like Wijchen and Nijmegen.|$|E
5000|$|The luxe motor type rapidly supplanted {{the older}} aak and <b>tjalk</b> hull styles, {{offering}} straighter sides, a wider beam and lengths which exceeded the largest {{examples of the}} older hull styles, all of which contributed to a greater cargo capacity. In addition the [...] "duck tail" [...] transom, prop and rudder arrangement was better suited to diesel propulsion than the sail-optimised hulls of older types, though they do suffer from a pronounced [...] "walk" [...] effect when running aft. Typically they can carry 6-9 knots through water, the hydrodynamics of the hull not being suited to higher speeds.|$|E
