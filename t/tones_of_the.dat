5|$|Earlier travels had exposed Géricault {{to victims}} of {{insanity}} and plague, and while researching the Méduse his effort to be historically accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the stiffness of corpses. To achieve the most authentic rendering of the flesh <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead, he made sketches of bodies in the morgue of the Hospital Beaujon, studied the faces of dying hospital patients, brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay, and for a fortnight drew a severed head, borrowed from a lunatic asylum and stored on his studio roof.|$|E
5|$|The {{panels of}} Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion are painted on light Sundeala boards, a {{material}} Bacon was using {{at the time}} as an inexpensive alternative to canvas. Each bears a single taut sculptural form pitched against a harsh orange background. The orange hue displays inconsistently across the canvasses, {{due in part to the}} low level of oil in the paint, which resulted in varying rates of absorption into the board. The pallid flesh <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> figures were achieved by overlaying grey and white brushstrokes, while the figures' props were coloured using a variety of yellow, green, white, and purple tones.|$|E
5|$|Zero {{was created}} by Taro Yoko, the game's {{director}} and co-writer, and designed by Kimihiko Fujisaka. Yoko wanted an unusual type of protagonist {{that had not been}} featured very often in games. Fujisaka crafted her to emulate the dark <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series, although he also added features to create a feminine vibe, such as the flower in her eye. Despite being criticized for her characterization and personality, she has also been praised for her interactions with the other characters and for standing out among video game protagonists. Fans of the Drakengard series in Japan have also received her positively.|$|E
50|$|Akan, a Niger-Congo {{language}} spoken in Ghana, has two tones: high and low. The low tone is default.

5|$|The Search for Spock {{opened on}} June 1, 1984. In its {{first week of}} release, the film grossed over $16 million from almost 2,000 theaters across North America. It went on to gross $76 million at the {{domestic}} box office, {{with a total of}} $87 million worldwide. Critical reaction to The Search for Spock was positive, but notably less so than the previous film. Reviewers generally praised the cast and characters, while criticism tended to focus on the plot; the special effects were conflictingly received. Roger Ebert called the film a compromise between the <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first and second Star Trek films. The Search for Spock has since been released on multiple home video formats, including VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray high definition discs. Nimoy went on to direct The Search for Spocks sequel, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} financing {{from other}} sources, including Saul Zaentz (who agreed {{to distribute the}} soundtrack album on his Fantasy Records label), the budget was tight enough to exclude pencil tests, so Bakshi had to test the animation by flipping an animator's drawings in his hand before they were inked and painted. When a cameraman realized that the cels for the desert scenes were not wide enough and revealed the transparency, Bakshi painted a cactus to cover the mistake. Very few storyboards were used. Bakshi and Vita walked around the Lower East Side, Washington Square Park, Chinatown and Harlem, taking moody snapshots. Artist Ira Turek inked the outlines of these photographs onto cels with a Rapidograph, the technical pen preferred by Crumb, giving the film's backgrounds a stylized realism virtually unprecedented in animation. The <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> watercolor backgrounds were influenced {{by the work of}} Ashcan School painters such as George Luks and John French Sloan. Among other unusual techniques, bent and fisheye camera perspectives were used to portray the way the film's hippies and hoodlums viewed the city. Many scenes featured documentary recordings of real conversations in place of scripted dialogue—this too would become a signature of Bakshi's.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia levis grows as a tall shrub {{to small}} tree, and can reach 5m (16ft) in height. The flaky soft bark is dark grey on the surface, while deeper layers are reddish in colour. Within the bark are epicormic buds, which sprout new growth after bushfire. The new growth is smooth to {{slightly}} hairy. The large green leaves measure 6 to 14cm (2.2–5.5in) in length, and 1.3 to 8cm (0.5–3.2in) in width, and are oblong or sickle-shaped (falcate). The asymmetrical shape helps distinguish the species from P.lanceolata. The bright green foliage, particularly of new growth, stands {{out against the}} more subdued <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surrounding vegetation and the stems, which are reddish in colour. The yellow flowers appear in summer and autumn (December to April), and peak over December to February. They are arranged on short axillary racemes along the branchlets. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical perianth, consisting of tepals fused {{for most of their}} length, within which are both male and female parts. The central style is surrounded by the anther, which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above. They provide a landing area for insects attending to the stigma, which is located {{at the tip of the}} style. The smooth fleshy fruit, known as a drupe, is green and more or less round, measuring 1cm (0.4in) by 0.8cm (0.3in) in diameter. It contains two seeds, and has a spike at the end. The drupe is juicy but stringy when unripe, and the seeds and skin are inedible.|$|E

25|$|Sable champagne, {{a result}} of the {{dilution}} effect of the champagne gene. Like all champagnes, sable champagnes have hazel eyes and pinkish, freckled skin.

25|$|In music theory, {{the circle}} of fifths (or circle of fourths) is the {{relationship}} among the 12 <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chromatic scale, their corresponding key signatures, and the associated major and minor keys.

25|$|Whistled {{language}} is rare compared to spoken language, {{but it is}} found in cultures around the world. It is especially common in tone languages where the whistled tones transmit the <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> syllables (tone melodies of the words). This might be because in tone languages the tone melody carries more of the functional load of communication while non-tonal phonology carries proportionally less. The genesis of a whistled language has never been recorded in either case and has not yet received much productive study.|$|E

25|$|Breton musician, teacher, and luthier Youenn Le Bihan {{invented the}} piston in 1983.

25|$|The first type is {{the poetic}} lyrics written in {{literary}} or classical Wenyan Chinese (文言). In the past, Cantopop maintained the Cantonese Opera tradition of matching the musical notes with <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> language. Relatively few Cantopop songs use truly colloquial Cantonese terms, and fewer songs contain lyrics. Songs written in this style are {{usually reserved for}} TV shows about ancient China. Since the 1980s, increasing numbers of singers have departed from this tradition, though some big names like Roman Tam stayed true to traditional techniques.|$|E
25|$|Changes to the plumage are variable; {{many have}} been {{selected}} to lose dark brown <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wild bird. The result is an animal marked, or completely covered in white feathers. Others retain plumage close to the natural; some, such as the modern Toulouse goose look almost identical to the greylag in plumage, differing only in structure. White geese are often preferred as they look better plucked and dressed, with any small down feathers remaining being less conspicuous. From {{the time of the}} Romans, white geese have been held in great esteem.|$|E
25|$|Mozart {{introduced}} the newly invented clarinet {{into the chamber}} music arsenal, with the Kegelstatt Trio for viola, clarinet and piano, K. 498, and the Quintet for Clarinet and String Quartet, K. 581. He also tried other innovative ensembles, including the quintet for violin, two violas, cello, and horn, K. 407, quartets for flute and strings, and various wind instrument combinations. He wrote six string quintets for two violins, two violas and cello, which explore the rich tenor <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> violas, adding {{a new dimension to}} the string quartet conversation.|$|E

25|$|The first {{consistent}} {{system for}} transcribing Chinese words in Latin alphabet {{is thought to}} have been designed in 1583-88 by Matteo Ricci and Michele Ruggieri for their Portuguese-Chinese dictionary— the first ever European-Chinese dictionary. Unfortunately, the manuscript was misplaced in the Jesuit Archives in Rome, and not re-discovered until 1934. The dictionary was finally published in 2001. During the winter of 1598, Ricci, {{with the help of his}} Jesuit colleague Lazzaro Cattaneo (1560–1640), compiled a Chinese-Portuguese dictionary as well, in which <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> romanized Chinese syllables were indicated with diacritical marks. This work has also been lost but not rediscovered.|$|E
25|$|Work on the Great Hall {{began in}} 1938 {{with a local}} {{tradesman}} Len Jarrold as the leading hand. Jörgensen had originally designed a modest structure of mud brick, however during the excavation a reef of mudstone was uncovered. The unique ochre <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stone inspired Jörgensen to re-design and the resulting larger structure was the Great Hall. He was fortunate in that Whelan the Wreckers were demolishing the charming Royal Insurance Building which stood at 414, Collins Street, Melbourne, which contained the limestone windows and the stone balconies carved in the Gothic manner, that now adorn the Great Hall and give it its unique character. Students carved other windows and the gargoyles, which incorporated the traditional grotesque faces as seen in medieval architecture.|$|E
25|$|The music {{provided}} in Crowley's psalter {{is similar to}} the Gregorian <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Latin Sarum Rite psalter, and it can be found in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians. A single note is given for each syllable in each verse, in keeping with Archbishop Thomas Cranmer's mandate for the reformed Edwardian liturgy. The goal was to emphasize simplicity and to encourage attentiveness to what was being sung by omitting complex vocal ornamentation. In addition to the Psalms, Crowley's psalter includes English versions of the canticles Benedictus, Magnificat, Nunc Dimittis, and Benedicite, as well as the Te Deum and the Quicumque Vult. These are the Cantica Prophetarium retained in the Book of Common Prayer from the Sarum psalter — key parts of the Divine Office.|$|E
