The latter group constitute only 0.5% of prey over time—seasonally varying {{from a peak of}} 1.8% in autumn <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>of</b> 0.2% of prey caught in winter.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{widespread}} use of poliovirus vaccine in the mid-1950s, the incidence of poliomyelitis declined dramatically in many industrialized countries. A global effort to eradicate polio began in 1988, led by the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and The Rotary Foundation. These efforts have reduced the number of annual diagnosed cases by 99.9 percent; from an estimated 350,000 cases in 1988 <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>of</b> 483 cases in 2001, after which it remained at a level of about 1,000 - 2000 cases per year for a number of years.

Declines were particularly significant in the outlying islands, some of which remain vulnerable to ongoing losses. Although Orkney {{is in many ways}} very distinct from the other islands and archipelagos of Scotland these trends are very similar to those experienced elsewhere. The archipelago's population grew by 11% in the decade to 2011 as recorded by the census. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.|$|E

5|$|In {{the most}} recent seasons, however, the {{audience}} figures have dropped considerably. In Canada, season six was watched by fewer viewers than had watched season five; episode fourteen was the highest-viewed episode of the season, {{with a total of}} 645,000 viewers. The season finale was watched by 520,000 viewers, and the season overall averaged 522,000 viewers. The average viewing figures fell again during the seventh season. The season premiere achieved the highest figures with 585,000 viewers.

5|$|Just as World War I had a {{significant}} impact on the college, World War II was pivotal in the college's history too. Within four days of the attack on Pearl Harbor, thirteen students withdrew from the college to join the military. The enrollment dropped from 2,077 students in 1940 <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>of</b> 860 students (21% were men) in spring 1943. Faculty decreased to as low as 60 from 112 before the war had begun. Before the war was over, 3,500 SDSC graduates, students, former students, and faculty entered the armed forces, with 135 losing their lives. Not surprisingly for a city dominated by a naval base, a large majority joined the Navy. Others joined the Air Corps, participating in the Doolittle Raid over Japan and battles over the Philippines and the East Indies.|$|E
5|$|Lead mining on Grassington Moor became {{important}} in the 18th century, {{and as a result}} of the mines' success, a number of the mine owners promoted the provision of the Grassington to Pately Bridge turnpike road, which was begun in 1760 and provided an all-weather route across the moors for wagons. From the early 19th century Hebden was a dormitory village for some miners, contributing to the population rising to more than 500 in the 1830s. In the early 1850s profitable mines were established in the parish to the north of the village on veins associated with Grassington Moor, which helped sustain the population. Although activity continued sporadically into the last decade of the century, the accessible ore was largely exhausted by 1865, and the population declined <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>of</b> 199 in 1901.|$|E
