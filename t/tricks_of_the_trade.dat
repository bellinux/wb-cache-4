Early in his career he broke his ribs and backbone, but learned the <b>tricks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trade,</b> such as interlinking arms with opposition players {{to prevent them from}} jumping. Billy Horner compared him with Malcolm Poskett, and stated the only quality missing in Houchen's game was aggression. Horner and his coaching team of George Smith and Willie Maddren taught Houchen how to protect himself from the highly physical centre-halves that dominated the division, and the youngster learned how to hold the ball up and bring other players into the attack.|$|E

6000|$|Browning's {{paramount}} {{interest in}} human nature is further illustrated by his poems on the various arts. Of music, painting, and sculpture he has written with the intimate and minute knowledge of a specialist in each art. He is familiar with implements and materials, with the <b>tricks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trade,</b> {{the talk of the}} studios; but, after all, the art as an art is of much less interest to him than is the worker. The process and even the completed product are in Browning's view important only in so far as they reveal or affect the artist, the musician, the sculptor, or some phase of life. In such poems as [...] "Abt Vogler," [...] "Fra Lippo Lippi," [...] "Andrea del Sarto," [...] we are conscious not so much of music and pictures as of the secret springs of failure, the divine despairs and discontents, the aspirations, the creative ecstasies, of the men who wrought in these realms. Andrea del Sarto's art is not the real theme of the poem bearing his name. It is, rather, his character, of which his art is an expression. The central fact of the poem is the recognition that a soul morally impoverished cannot, even with well-nigh perfect technique, produce great work, while, even with faulty technique, a setting of the soul to grand issues will secure transcendent meanings. So, too, with Abt Vogler. His music is not of the greatest, but our concern is with the musician who, through the completeness of his spiritual absorption in music, is conducted into a realm of experience beyond that of speech or even of articulate thought.|$|E

40|$|Automatically {{learning}} features, especially robust features, {{has attracted}} much attention in the machine learning community. In this paper, we propose a new method to learn non-linear robust features by taking advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data manifold structure. We first follow <b>the</b> commonly used <b>trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trade,</b> that is learning robust features with artificially corrupted data, which are training samples with manually injected noise. Following <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> auto-encoder, we first assume features should contain much information to well reconstruct the input from its corrupted copies. However, merely reconstructing clean input from its noisy copies could make data manifold in the feature space noisy. To address this problem, we propose a new method, called Incremental Auto-Encoders, to iteratively denoise the extracted features. We assume the noisy manifold structure {{is caused by a}} diffusion process. Consequently, we reverse this specific diffusion process to further contract this noisy manifold, which results in an incremental optimization of model parameters. Furthermore, we show these learned non-linear features can be stacked into a hierarchy of features. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the proposed method can achieve better classification performances. Comment: This work was completed in Feb, 201...|$|R
