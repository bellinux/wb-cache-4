In this study, we investigated the generality of performance of <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> location heuristic and <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> temporal heuristic in the math domain to see if previous results generalized to other Intelligent Tutoring System domains. In support of past results, we found that <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> location heuristic provided a better goodness of fit to the learning curve standard, that is, it was better at performing error attribution than <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> temporal heuristic. One observation is that for tutors where the knowledge components can {{be determined by the}} interface location in which an action appears, using <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> location heuristic is likely to show better results than <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> temporal heuristic. It is possible that <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> temporal heuristic is better in situations where the different problem subgoals can be associated with a single location.
