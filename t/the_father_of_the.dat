5|$|Balzac uses meticulous, {{abundant}} {{detail to}} describe the Maison Vauquer, its inhabitants, and the world around them; this technique gave rise to his title as <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> realist novel. The details focus mostly on the penury {{of the residents of}} the Maison Vauquer. Much less intricate are the descriptions of wealthier homes; Madame de Beauséant's rooms are given scant attention, and the Nucingen family lives in a house sketched in the briefest detail.|$|E

Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country.|$|E

His rulership was criticised as dictatorial and authoritarian, of favouring Kikuyu over other ethnic groups, and of overseeing a growth in corruption and cronyism which have generated long-term problems for Kenya.|$|E

5|$|Some critics {{consider}} Balzac's writing exemplary of naturalism—a more pessimistic {{and analytical}} form of realism, {{which seeks to}} explain human behavior as intrinsically linked with the environment. French novelist Émile Zola declared Balzac <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> naturalist novel. Zola indicated that whilst the Romantics saw the world through a colored lens, the naturalist sees through a clear glass—precisely the sort of effect Balzac attempted to achieve in his works.|$|E
