5|$|Although {{his suicide}} is often {{linked to the}} Foundation’s {{financial}} difficulties, the letter clearly shows Favaloro overwhelmed by the corruption of <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>system</b> and feeling {{that he could not}} fight against this powerful organization. In some parts of the letter, he refers to himself as “Don Quijote” in his lonely battle against the giants. Aggravating this situation was that Favaloro had never recovered from the death of his wife in 1998. Following her death, he had resolved to marry one of his longtime colleagues and coauthors, Diana Truden; she lived with Favaloro during his final days and was in his Palermo neighborhood house when he committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies found}} that the {{financial}} crisis and accompanying recession could {{not account for the}} entirety of the slowdown and that structural changes likely share at least partial credit. A 2013 study estimated that changes to <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>system</b> had been responsible for {{about a quarter of the}} recent reduction in inflation. Paul Krawzak claimed that even if cost controls succeed in reducing the amount spent on healthcare, such efforts on their own may be insufficient to outweigh the long-term burden placed by demographic changes, particularly the growth of the population on Medicare.|$|E

Due to hyperinflation, those hospitals still open {{were not able to}} obtain basic drugs and medicines. The situation changed drastically after the Unity Government and the introduction of the multi-currency system in February 2009 although the political and economic crisis also contributed to the emigration of the doctors and people with medical knowledge.|$|E

5|$|Adventure 2 has <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>system</b> {{found in}} many other Sonic games. The player {{collects}} rings scattered throughout the levels; being hit by an enemy while holding rings causes the player to drop them all, while being hit without rings causes them to lose a life. Tails and Eggman have the customary health bar, which is slowly refilled by collecting rings. Dying with no lives results in a game over screen. The characters can obtain permanent upgrades that grant them new abilities; for example, one allows Sonic and Shadow to dash along a sequential trail of rings to reach distant platforms, while another lets Knuckles and Rouge attack powerfully enough to break certain containers. Chaos Drives {{can be used with}} the player's Chao (small, anthropomorphic animals).|$|E
5|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} of many developing nations, funding vitally effects how emergency medicine fits into <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>system.</b> Preventive {{care is a}} crucial part of healthcare in developing countries, and {{it may be difficult to}} budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine does not need to be unreasonably expensive, particularly if developing countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.|$|E

5|$|In October 2010, her {{government}} {{introduced legislation}} to reform funding arrangements for <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>system,</b> {{with the intention}} of giving the Commonwealth responsibility for providing the majority of funding to public hospitals and 100 per cent of funding for primary care and GP services. In February 2011, Gillard announced extensive revision of the original health funding reforms proposed by the Rudd Government, which had been unable to secure the support of all state governments. The revised Gillard government plan proposed that the federal government move towards providing 50% of new health funding (and not 60 per cent as originally agreed) and removed the requirement of the states to cede a proportion of their GST revenue to the Federal Government in order to fund the new arrangement. The new agreement was supported by all state premiers and chief ministers and signed on 2 August.|$|E
5|$|The Saint Francis Health System owns several {{hospitals}} with {{a central}} location at Saint Francis Hospital {{in the southern part}} of the city. The facility contains 700 doctors and 918 beds, and with more than 7,000 employees, the network is the second largest healthcare employer in the state. <b>The</b> <b>health</b> <b>system</b> also operates a heart hospital, which was named by General Electric in 2004 one of the most advanced heart hospitals in the nation. St. John Medical Center, located in an 11-story midtown center, employs nearly 700 doctors. Other networks, such as Hillcrest Health System, operate a number of facilities in varying sizes. Beginning in 2007, the city elected to renew a five-year contract with EMSA for ambulance service after a period of consideration to switch to the Tulsa Fire Department for providing such services.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} no heads-up display. Instead, {{condition of}} the player character is relayed through the sound cues of his heartbeat and breathing, which become more pronounced when wounded, and color draining from the screen with loss of blood and strength. Specific injuries are also indicated visually and aurally: for example, a broken leg causes the character to limp while making appropriate noises, while a broken arm makes aiming more difficult. <b>The</b> <b>health</b> <b>system</b> {{was designed as a}} more realistic take on character injury than other games of its genre in that different wounds, including poisoning and bleeding, require different remedies, such as a splint for a broken leg. The inventory screen shows the character's injuries (displayed on his character model) and all carried items.|$|E

40|$|Responsiveness {{is a key}} {{objective}} of national <b>health</b> <b>systems.</b> Responsive <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> anticipate and adapt to existing and future health needs, thus contributing to better health outcomes. Of all <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> objectives, responsiveness is the least studied, which perhaps reflects lack of comprehensive frameworks that go beyond the normative characteristics of responsive services. This paper contributes to a growing, yet limited, knowledge on this topic. Herewith, we review the current frameworks for understanding <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> responsiveness and drawing on these, as well as key frameworks from the wider public services literature, propose a comprehensive conceptual framework for <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> responsiveness. This paper should {{be of interest to}} different stakeholders who are engaged in analysing and improving <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> responsiveness. Our review shows that existing knowledge on <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> responsiveness can be extended along the three areas. First, responsiveness entails an actual experience of people’s interaction with their <b>health</b> <b>system,</b> which confirms or disconfirms their initial expectations of the system. Second, the experience of interaction is shaped by both the people and <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> sides of this interaction. Third, different influences shape people’s interaction with their <b>health</b> <b>system,</b> ultimately affecting their resultant experiences. Therefore, recognition of both people and <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> sides of interaction and their key determinants would enhance the conceptualisations of responsiveness. Our proposed framework builds on, and advances, the core frameworks in <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> literature. It positions the experience of interaction between people and <b>health</b> <b>system</b> as <b>the</b> centrepiece and recognises the determinants of responsiveness experience both from <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> (eg, actors, processes) and the people (eg, initial expectations) sides. While we hope to trigger further thinking on <b>the</b> conceptualisation of <b>health</b> <b>system</b> responsiveness, <b>the</b> proposed framework can guide assessments of, and interventions to strengthen, <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> responsiveness...|$|R
