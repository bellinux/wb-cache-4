McCain took on the tobacco industry in 1998, proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti-smoking campaigns, discourage teenage smokers, increase money for health research studies, and help states pay for smoking-related health care costs. Supported by the Clinton administration but opposed by the industry and most Republicans, the bill failed to gain cloture.|$|E

However, such reform would necessarily have meant tax increases, [...] and with the 2003 gubernatorial election looming, legislators from both parties stuck strictly to a pledge not to raise taxes. Consequently, in the 2003 legislative session, members of the General Assembly crafted a budget that completely disregarded any input from Patton.

500|$|Assessor Berrios was {{investigated}} by the Cook County Board of Ethics for allegedly accepting excessive political contributions from attorneys who argued property-tax appeals before the Assessor and Board of Review. The Board of Ethics sent letters to 15 tax attorneys, warning that their donations to Berrios during the 2010 election cycle had exceeded the county campaign contribution limits. Berrios' attorney objected that the regulation was [...] "illegal", and Berrios sought an advisory opinion from the Cook County State’s Attorney. In February 2011, a Cook County Deputy State’s Attorney wrote an advisory opinion that the County Board lacked the home rule authority to limit campaign contributions to the Assessor and that state campaign finance law prevails. The County Board's legal counsel issued an opinion that the new contribution limits were unconstitutional. Cook County commissioners scaled back <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> reform law and the Cook County Board of Ethics dropped its investigation of Berrios' campaign contributions.|$|E
500|$|In June 2003, Patton issued pardons to {{four men}} who were under {{indictment}} for violating campaign finance laws during the 1995 gubernatorial race. The indictments stemmed from charges by then-candidate Larry Forgy that Patton had skirted campaign finance laws by coordinating expenditures with the Teamsters and the state Democratic Party. A Franklin County grand jury returned the indictments in 1998, but a circuit court judge dismissed them in 1999 on grounds that <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> law was too vague. An appeals court reversed that decision the following year, and in 2003, the Kentucky Supreme Court upheld the indictments {{by a vote of}} 5–1. The Supreme Court of the United States refused to hear an appeal on June 13, 2003. Two days later, Patton issued pardons for all four men.

500|$|In 1997, McCain became {{chairman}} of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee; he was criticized for accepting funds from corporations and businesses under the committee's purview, but responded by saying that, [...] "Literally every business in America falls under the Commerce Committee" [...] and that he restricted those contributions to $1,000 and thus {{was not part of}} the big-money nature of <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> problem. [...] In that year, Time magazine named McCain as one of the [...] "25 Most Influential People in America". [...] McCain used his chairmanship to challenge the tobacco industry in 1998, proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti-smoking campaigns and reduce the number of teenage smokers, increase research money on health studies, and help states pay for smoking-related health care costs. [...] The industry spent some $40–50million in national advertising in response; while McCain's bill had the support of the Clinton administration and many public health groups, most Republican senators opposed it, stating it would create an unwieldy new bureaucracy. The bill failed to gain cloture twice and was seen as a bad political defeat for McCain. [...] During 1998 a revised version of the McCain-Feingold Act came up for Senate consideration; in addition to banning soft money, it sought to restrict [...] "issue ads" [...] run by independent groups within 60 days of an election. While having majority support, it was fiercely opposed by Senator Mitch McConnell on free speech and partisan threat grounds, and it again fell victim to a filibuster and failed to gain cloture.|$|E
