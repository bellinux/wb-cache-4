Letters described beatings Chen {{and his wife}} were subjected to, seizure of documents and communication devices, cutting off of electric power to their residence, and placing of metal sheets over the windows of their house. Harassment of Chen's family continued throughout his house arrest, and extended to Chen's six-year-old daughter, who was briefly banned from attending school and had her toys confiscated by guards, and to Chen's mother, who was harassed while working in the fields. Authorities reportedly told Chen that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> 60 million yuan ($9.5 million) to keep him under house arrest.|$|E
5|$|In December 1999 Warner Music Group, {{which owns}} Atlantic Records, stated they {{expected}} to sell at least five to six million copies of Shades of Purple. Sales had exceeded one million by September 2000, though investors were disappointed as they had not yet recuperated the amount <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> promoting the duo; {{they expected to}} break even {{before the end of}} the year. The album sold 107,000 units in its opening week in the US, and had sold 268,000 units there by March 2002. Worldwide sales of the album exceeded 1.5 million by January 2002.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{sales of}} private {{underground}} blast shelters increased noticeably after 2009, with many construction companies' advertisements {{calling attention to}} the 2012 apocalypse. In Michigan, schools were closed for the Christmas holidays two days early, in part because rumours of the 2012 apocalypse were raising fears of repeat shootings similar to that at Sandy Hook. American reality TV stars Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt revealed that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> most of their $10 million of accumulated earnings by 2010 because they believed the world would end in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Leonard (Johnny Galecki), Sheldon, Raj (Kunal Nayyar) and Howard (Simon Helberg) are in Leonard and Sheldon's apartment, {{waiting for}} Comic-Con tickets {{to go on}} sale online.

Tickets run out and the four men are {{disappointed}} {{that they will not}} be able to attend, especially as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> so much time on their costumes, intending to go as different versions of the Hulk as portrayed by Lou Ferrigno, Eric Bana, Edward Norton, and Mark Ruffalo.|$|E
5|$|The project {{continued}} {{to run into}} difficulties with malfunctions, financial problems and threats of work stoppages. New letters patent were issued on 12 August 1779 that doubled the rates and extended the term to ninety-nine years. The concessionary could now also expropriate land for shops, warehouses and housing for employees. The work was complete in May 1780 and was finally opened for navigation from Givors to Rive-de-Gier the following December. The concessionaries reported that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> six million francs, but the canal probably cost much more.|$|E

5|$|Arguments soon {{broke out}} between the Crown and the {{corporation}} over the deal. The Crown argued that the corporation was not adequately maintaining the castle and blockhouses. The Earl of Sussex complained in 1569 {{that they were in}} need of repair, and a 1576 survey stated that their gun platforms were in poor condition and that the ditches had become clogged with earth, while coastal erosion had undermined the South Blockhouse. Queen Elizabeth I provided 300 trees to help the repair work and a new jetty was built to protect {{the southern end of the}} defences from the sea. The Crown gave 60 trees to the town to help with further repairs in 1581. Fears of a Spanish invasion resulted in fresh repairs being carried out, and the threat of the Armada in 1588 resulted in proposals to build additional earthworks around the blockhouses, but nothing appear to have actually been carried out. The dispute over maintenance between the Crown and the town finally came to court in 1588; the corporation argued that green timber had been used in the original construction work and claimed that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> £2,893 between 1552 and 1587 on the defences: the Crown's case failed.|$|E
5|$|Soon afterwards, Weston {{left the}} project, and Thomas Morris was {{recalled}} from Ireland to take over. He had previous experience building {{the extension of}} the Bridgewater Canal to Runcorn. Under his direction, the canal opened from Chester to Huxley Aqueduct on 16 January 1775, and to Beeston in June. Morris was sacked in September, to be replaced by Josiah Clowes. He too was sacked, and was followed by Moon, who had previously acted as assistant to Morris. The canal was completed under the direction of Joseph Taylor. In September 1776, the junction with the Dee was opened, but the project was now in financial difficulties. By late 1777, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> all of the share capital of £42,000 and another £19,000, which had been raised as a loan guaranteed by Samuel Egerton of Tatton. He was a shareholder in the company and related to the Duke of Bridgewater. They applied for another Act of Parliament, which allowed them to raise another £25,000, by additional calls on existing shareholders, and to borrow £30,000 as a mortgage. They succeeded in raising £6,000 by making additional calls, and borrowed £4,000 from Richard Reynolds, an ironmaster from Ketley, who was responsible for several of the East Shropshire Canals, including the Wombridge Canal and the Ketley Canal.|$|E
5|$|With {{the passing}} of the Land Drainage Act 1930, the Welland Catchment Board was created. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> £91,537 on the outfall by 1937. Towards the end of the Second World War, E. G. Taverner, the chief {{engineer}} for the drainage board, devised a plan to relieve flooding in Spalding by creating a bypass channel, and building the Greatford Cut to divert the waters of the West Glen river into the Welland upstream of Market Deeping. The scheme cost £723,000, with much of the work being carried out by W. & C. French, and the Coronation Channel around Spalding was opened in September 1953. Fulney lock was constructed {{at the same time to}} exclude the tide from the upper river, as was the Maxey Cut, an embanked channel that bypasses the villages of Market Deeping, Deeping Gate and Deeping St James. During the 1960s and 1970s, several sections of the river above Stamford were made straighter and deeper, to reduce the risk of flooding of agricultural land. To address the habitat and environmental issues causes by such engineering work, the Welland Rivers Trust, a limited company and charitable trust, was set up in 2010. They are seeking to direct regeneration of the river by co-ordinating various organisations, which are known collectively as the Welland Valley Partnership. They published a major document outlining their proposals in February 2013.|$|E

25|$|However Ireland {{spent the}} {{remainder}} of the decade in {{the bottom half of the}} table, only managing to avoid last place on three occasions.

25|$|As far as is {{generally}} accepted by mainstream scholars, Christopher Marlowe died on 30 May 1593 {{as the result}} of a knife wound above the right eye inflicted upon him by Ingram Frizer, an acquaintance with whom he had been dining.

25|$|Due to {{numerous}} delays, 1,250 temporary seats weren't ready {{in time for}} the game. According to a police officer standing near the affected area, the seats hadn't been installed {{in time for the}} fire marshal to inspect them. The NFL scrambled almost until kickoff to find replacement seats. Eventually, 850 fans in four sections were relocated, while 400 fans in two sections were given a refund equivalent to three times the face value of their ticket. The latter set of fans were later offered the chance to watch the game on monitors in the North Field Club behind the Steelers bench, but would still get the triple refund. Some of these fans were still upset, since <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> thousands on airfare and hotels. NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said that when the league decided to relocate the 850 fans, it lost any shot of setting the attendance record.|$|E
