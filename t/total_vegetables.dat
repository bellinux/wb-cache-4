40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that cancer can be prevented by high intake of fruits and vegetables. However, inconsistent results from many studies {{have not been able}} to conclusively establish an inverse association between fruit and vegetable intake and overall cancer risk. METHODS: We conducted a prospective analysis of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort to assess relationships between intake of total fruits, <b>total</b> <b>vegetables,</b> and total fruits and vegetables combined and cancer risk during 1992 - 2000. Detailed information on the dietary habit and lifestyle variables of the cohort was obtained. Cancer incidence and mortality data were ascertained, and hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariable Cox regression models. Analyses were also conducted for cancers associated with tobacco and alcohol after stratification for tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking. RESULTS: Of the initial 142 605 men and 335 873 women included in the study, 9604 men and 21 000 women were identified with cancer after a median follow-up of 8. 7 years. The crude cancer incidence rates were 7. 9 per 1000 person-years in men and 7. 1 per 1000 person-years in women. Associations between reduced cancer risk and increased intake of total fruits and vegetables combined and <b>total</b> <b>vegetables</b> for the entire cohort were similar (200 g/d increased intake of fruits and vegetables combined, HR = 0. 97, 95 % CI = 0. 96 to 0. 99; 100 g/d increased intake of <b>total</b> <b>vegetables,</b> HR = 0. 98, 95 % CI = 0. 97 to 0. 99); intake of fruits showed a weaker inverse association (100 g/d increased intake of total fruits, HR = 0. 99, 95 % CI = 0. 98 to 1. 00). The reduced risk of cancer associated with high vegetable intake was restricted to women (HR = 0. 98, 95 % CI = 0. 97 to 0. 99). Stratification by alcohol intake suggested a stronger reduction in risk in heavy drinkers and was confined to cancers caused by smoking and alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: A very small inverse association between intake of total fruits and vegetables and cancer risk was observed in this study. Given the small magnitude of the observed associations, caution should be applied in their interpretation...|$|E
40|$|Background Fruit and {{vegetable}} intakes {{have been associated}} with a reduced risk of colon cancer; however, in more recent studies associations have been less consistent. Statistical power to examine associations by colon site has been limited in previous studies. Methods Fruit {{and vegetable}} intakes in relation to colon cancer risk were examined in the Pooling Project of Prospective Studies of Diet and Cancer. Relative risks (RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated separately in 14 studies using Cox proportional hazards model and then pooled using a random- effects model. Intakes of total fruits and vegetables, total fruits, and <b>total</b> <b>vegetables</b> were categorized according to quintiles and absolute cutpoints. Analyses were conducted for colon cancer overall and for proximal and distal colon cancer separately. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results Among 756 217 men and women followed for up to 6 to 20 years, depending on the study, 5838 were diagnosed with colon cancer. The pooled multivariable RRs (95 % CIs) of colon cancer for the highest versus lowest quintiles of intake were 0. 91 (0. 82 to 1. 01, Ptrend =. 19) for total fruits and vegetables, 0. 93 (0. 85 to 1. 02, Ptrend =. 28) for total fruits, and 0. 94 (0. 86 to 1. 02, P trend =. 17) for <b>total</b> <b>vegetables.</b> Similar results were observed when intakes were categorized by identical absolute cut points across studies (pooled multivariable RR = 0. 90, 95 % CI = 0. 77 to 1. 05 for 800 or more versus < 200 g/day of total fruits and vegetables, Ptrend =. 06). The age-standardized incidence rates of colon cancer for these two intake categories were 54 and 61 per 100 000 person-years, respectively. When analyzed by colon site, the pooled multivari- able RRs (95 % CIs) comparing total fruit and vegetable intakes of 800 or more versus less than 200 g/day were 0. 74 (0. 57 to 0. 95, Ptrend =. 02) for distal colon cancers and 1. 02 (0. 82 to 1. 27, Ptrend =. 57) for proximal colon cancers. Similar site-specific associations were observed for total fruits and <b>total</b> <b>vegetables.</b> Conclusion Fruit and vegetable intakes were not strongly associated with colon cancer risk overall but may be associated with a lower risk of distal colon cancer...|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the association between}} self-reported consumption {{of fruits and vegetables}} and prostate cancer risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). Data on food consumption and complete follow-up for cancer incidence were available for 130, 544 men in 7 countries recruited into EPIC between 1993 and 1999. After an average of 4. 8 years of follow-up, there were 1, 104 incident cases of prostate cancer. The associations of consumption of total fruits, <b>total</b> <b>vegetables,</b> cruciferous vegetables and combined total fruits and vegetables with prostate cancer risk were examined using Cox regression, stratified for recruitment center and adjusted for height, weight and energy intake. There was a wide range in consumption of fruits and vegetables: mean intakes (g/day) in the bottom and top fifths of the distribution, as estimated from 24 -hr recalls in a subsample of participants, were 53. 2 and 410. 7 for fruits, 97. 1 and 242. 1 for vegetables and 169. 0 and 633. 7 for fruits and vegetables combined. No significant associations between fruit and vegetable consumption and prostate cancer risk were observed. Relative risks (95 % confidence intervals) in the top fifth of the distribution of consumption, compared to the bottom fifth, were 1. 06 (0. 84 - 1. 34) for total fruits, 1. 00 (0. 81 - 1. 22) for <b>total</b> <b>vegetables</b> and 1. 00 (0. 79 - 1. 26) for total fruits and vegetables combined; intake of cruciferous vegetables was not associated with risk.

A cohort of 10, 449 participants with self-reported diabetes within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study was followed for a mean of 9 y. Intakes of vegetables, legumes, and fruit were assessed at baseline between 1992 and 2000 using validated country-specific questionnaires. A total of 1346 deaths occurred. Multivariate relative risks (RR) for all-cause mortality were estimated in Cox regression models and FIR for cause-specific mortality were derived in a competing risk model. An increment in intake of <b>total</b> <b>vegetables,</b> legumes, and fruit of 80 g/d {{was associated with a}} RR of death from all causes of 0. 94 [95 % CI 0. 90 - 0. 98]. Analyzed separately, vegetables and legumes were associated with a significantly reduced risk, whereas nonsignificant inverse associations for fruit intake were observed. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and mortality due to non-CVD/non-cancer causes were significantly inversely associated with intake of <b>total</b> <b>vegetables,</b> legumes, and fruit (RR 0. 88 [95 % CI 0. 81 - 0. 95] and 0. 90 [0. 82 - 0. 99], respectively) but not cancer mortality 0. 08 [0. 99 - 1. 17]). Intake of vegetables, legumes, and fruit was associated with reduced risks of all-cause and CVD mortality in a diabetic population.

Setting: Databases from dietary surveys in 6 European countries. Results: Quantile analysis based on iron intake among adult women resulted in differences among European countries regarding (macro) nutrient intake and consumption of food groups. However, in all countries women in the highest quartile had a higher intake of energy and dietary fibre and a higher intake of most food groups. In developing FBDG adjustment of energy intake is recommended. Discriminant analyses showed that among Dutch women potatoes, red meat, sausages, offal, savoury snacks, eggs and <b>total</b> <b>vegetables</b> were found to be the most predictive for differences in iron intake. Relatively high correlations were observed for iron and dietary fibre and iron and (some) B-vitamins.

Conclusions: Inverse associations with lung cancer are found for both vegetable and fruit intake, but no specific type of vegetable or fruit seems to be particularly responsible...|$|E
40|$|Background: Higher intakes of fruit, vegetables, {{and dark}} fish may prevent {{sudden cardiac death}} and arrhythmias, but the exact mech-anisms are not fully understood. Objective: We {{examined}} whether high consumption of fruit, vege-tables, and dark fish {{would be associated with}} beneficial changes in heart rate variability (HRV). Design: HRV variables were measured among 586 older men with 928 total observations from November 2000 to June 2007 in the Normative Aging Study, a community-based longitudinal study of aging. Dietary intake was evaluated with a self-administered semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire and categorized into quartiles. Results: After controlling for potential confounders, intake of green leafy vegetables was positively associated with normalized high-frequency power and inversely associated with normalized low-fre-quency power (P for trend, 0. 05). These significant associations were retained after further adjustment for healthy lifestyle factors, such as physical activity and use of multivitamins. No significant association was seen between HRV measures and intakes of other fruit and vegetables, vitamin C, carotenoids, tuna and dark-meat fish, or n– 3 (omega- 3) fatty acids. An effect modification of intake of noncitrus fruit by obesity and of <b>total</b> <b>vegetables</b> and cruciferous vegetables by cigarette smoking was seen, which warrants further investigation. Conclusion: These findings suggest that higher intake of green leafy vegetables may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease through favorable changes in cardiac autonomic function.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{trade-off}} between purchases and home production of food. We develop a simple household production model which predicts a zero elasticity of home production with respect to total expenditure. Focusing on vegetables, we use data from the 1991 French National Food Survey. Due to data limitations, a reduced form of the structural household production model is estimated. We use Working Leser functional forms for the share of <b>vegetables</b> in <b>total</b> food consumption and the share of home production in vegetable consumption, conditional on the decision to maintain a kitchen garden. As predicted by the theoretical model, we estimate a zero elasticity of home production with respect to <b>total</b> <b>vegetable</b> outla...|$|R
40|$|Background Fruits and {{vegetables}} (F/V) {{have been examined}} extensively in nutrition research in relation to colorectal cancer (CRC). However, their protective effect is subject to debate, possibly because of different effects on different subsites of the large bowel. Objective To determine whether any association between F/V consumption and risk of CRC differed by subsite of the bowel (proximal colon, distal colon, and rectum). Design The Western Australian Bowel Health Study is a population-based, case-control study conducted between June 2005 and August 2007. Complete food frequency questionnaire data were analysed from 834 CRC cases and 939 controls. Logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} estimate the effects of quartiles of F/V intake on risk of CRC at different subsites. Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for CRC overall and for the three separate subsites. Results Risk of proximal colon cancer and rectal cancer was not associated with intakes of <b>total</b> F/V, <b>total</b> <b>vegetable,</b> or <b>total</b> fruit. Brassica <b>vegetable</b> intake was inversely related with proximal colon cancer (Q 4 vs Q 1 OR 0. 62; 95 % CI 0. 41 to 0. 93). For distal colon cancer, significant negative trends were seen for total F/V, and <b>total</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake. Distal colon cancer risk was significantly decreased for intake of dark yellow vegetables (Q 4 vs Q 1 OR 0. 61; 95 % CI 0. 41 to 0. 92) and apples (Q 4 vs Q 1 OR 0. 51; 95 % CI 0. 34 to 0. 77). An increased risk for CRC was found to be associated with intake of fruit juice (Q 4 vs Q 1 OR 1. 74; 95 % CI 1. 24 to 2. 45). Conclusions Our results suggest that different F/V may confer different risks for cancer of the proximal colon, distal colon, or rectum. Future studies might consider taking into account the location of the tumor when examining the relation between F/V consumption and risk of CRC. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Several common {{flexible}} functional {{forms are}} evaluated for Texas agricultural production utilizing three procedures.

40|$|Although current dietary {{guidelines}} {{focus on}} a combination of specific nutrients and food items, most effective dietary interventions focus on patterns of dietary intake and take into account the relationships among nutritional factors. In a controlled nutrition intervention conducted at 16 workplaces, a self-administered health habits questionnaire (HHQ) including a 67 -item version of a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was distributed prior to a 15 -month intervention and again after it. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to reduce this large set of highly correlated FFQ food items to a smaller set of maximally uncorrelated components (PCs). Of the eight discrete food-based eating patterns targeted in the Treatwell intervention, six were highly correlated ([r[3 ̆e or = 0. 48) with at least one PC each. This indicates a high level of concordance between a priori intervention targets and actual behavior. Based on log-transformed preintervention FFQ measures, our results showed that a very high proportion (0. 55) {{of the variance in the}} FFQ data was explained by the PCs. A significantly greater increase in consumption of <b>total</b> <b>vegetables</b> and a larger decrease in dietary intake of ground and processed meats were observed among intervention companies. A comparison PCA conducted on intervention and control companies after the intervention indicated that patterns of intake were very stable over time...|$|E
40|$|Diet {{quality or}} {{macronutrient}} composition of total daily sodium intake (dNa) < 2300 mg/day in the United States (US) is unknown. Using data from 2011 – 2014 NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey), we examined 24 -h dietary recalls (n = 10, 142) from adults aged ≥ 18 years and investigated how diet composition and quality {{are associated with}} dNa. Diet quality was assessed using components of macronutrients and Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI- 2010). Associations were tested using linear regression analysis adjusted for total energy (kcal), age, gender, and race/ethnicity. One-day dNa in the lower quartiles were more likely reported among women, older adults (≥ 65 years old), and lower quartiles of total energy (kcal) (p-values ≤ 0. 001). With increasing dNa, {{there was an increase}} in the mean protein, fiber, and total fat densities, while total carbohydrates densities decreased. As dNa increased, meat protein, refined grains, dairy, and <b>total</b> <b>vegetables,</b> greens and beans densities increased; while total fruit and whole fruit densities decreased. Modified HEI- 2010 total score (total score without sodium component) increased as dNa increased (adjusted coefficient: 0. 11, 95 % confidence interval = 0. 07, 0. 15). Although diet quality, based on modified HEI- 2010 total score, increased on days with greater dNa, there is much room for improvement with mean diet quality of about half of the optimal level...|$|E
40|$|The authors prospectively {{evaluated}} {{fruit and}} vegetable consumption and the incidence of oral premalignant lesions among 42, 311 US men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Diet was assessed every 4 years by food frequency questionnaires. The authors confirmed 207 cases of clinically or histopathologically diagnosed oral premalignant lesions occurring between 1986 and 2002. Multivariate-adjusted relative risks were calculated from proportional hazards models. Significant inverse associations were observed with citrus fruits, citrus fruit juice, and vitamin-C-rich fruits and vegetables, indicating 30 – 40 % lower risks with greater intakes (e. g., citrus fruit juice quintile 5 vs. quintile 1 relative risk 0. 65, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 42, 0. 99). Inverse associations with fruits did not vary by smoking status and were stronger in analyses of baseline consumption, with a 10 -year lag time to disease follow-up (quintile 5 vs. quintile 1 relative risk 0. 41, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 20, 0. 82; p 0. 01). No associations were observed with <b>total</b> <b>vegetables</b> or with b-carotene-rich or lycopene-rich fruits and vegetables. For current smokers, green leafy vegetables (ptrend 0. 05) and b-carotene-rich fruits and vegetables (ptrend 0. 02) showed significant linear trends of increased risk (one additional serving/day relative risk 1. 7). The risk of oral premalignant lesions was significantly reduced with higher consumption of fruits, particularly citrus fruits and juices, while no consistent associations were apparent for vegetables...|$|E
40|$|Background Estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) {{breast cancer}} has few known or {{modifiable}} risk factors. Because ER- tumors {{account for only}} 15 % to 20 % of breast cancers, large pooled analyses are necessary to evaluate precisely the suspected inverse association between fruit and vegetable intake and risk of ER- breast cancer. Methods Among 993 466 women followed for 11 to 20 years in 20 cohort studies, we documented 19 869 estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and 4821 ER- breast cancers. We calculated study-specific multivariable relative risks (RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) using Cox proportional hazards regression analyses and then combined them using a random-effects model. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results <b>Total</b> fruit and <b>vegetable</b> intake was statistically significantly inversely associated with risk of ER- breast cancer but not with {{risk of breast cancer}} overall or of ER+ tumors. The inverse association for ER- tumors was observed primarily for vegetable consumption. The pooled relative risks comparing the highest vs lowest quintile of <b>total</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption were 0. 82 (95 % CI = 0. 74 to 0. 90) for ER - breast cancer and 1. 04 (95 % CI = 0. 97 to 1. 11) for ER+ breast cancer (Pcommon-effects by ER status <. 001). Total fruit consumption was non-statistically significantly associated with risk of ER - breast cancer (pooled multivariable RR comparing the highest vs lowest quintile = 0. 94, 95 % CI = 0. 85 to 1. 04). Conclusions We observed no association between <b>total</b> fruit and <b>vegetable</b> intake and risk of overall breast cancer. However, vegetable consumption was inversely associated with risk of ER- breast cancer in our large pooled analyses. © 2012 The Author...|$|R

40|$|Diet has an {{important}} role in the maintenance of oral health, but the relationship between diet and clinical outcomes following sanative therapy (ST) has not been investigated. Due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, we hypothesized that periodontal patients with higher intakes of vitamin C, vitamin D, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) would have greater reductions in probing depth (PD) after ST. Patients completed the Block food frequency questionnaire, a supplement use questionnaire and had their serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D measured. There were no significant associations between intakes of vitamin C, vitamin D, EPA, DHA and PD. There were, however, negative associations between intakes of linoleic acid, α- linolenic acid or <b>total</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake and PD, as well as a positive association between the total omega- 6 /omega- 3 ratio and PD (p < 0. 05). Therefore, dietary intakes of essential fatty acids and vegetables may be important modulators of periodontal outcomes following ST...|$|R
