500|$|... "Hunting Trip" [...] {{was written}} by Daniel J. Goor and {{directed}} by series co-creator Greg Daniels. The episode introduced a romantic subplot between the characters Andy and April which continued throughout the second season and into the third. Series co-creator Michael Schur said the pairing was not previously planned, but grew when it was discovered during the filming of [...] "Hunting Trip" [...] that actors Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt had strong comedic chemistry together. However, Schur also said the idea to pair them together in [...] "Hunting Trip" [...] stemmed in part from a line Plaza improvised in the first season finale [...] "Rock Show", when Andy explained his style of music and April replied that she completely understood him. Schur said, [...] "At the time, it was this little nothing, throwaway thing, but when we watched it, we thought <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> there." ...|$|E
500|$|During a {{scene when}} Andy {{describes}} {{his style of}} music, April responds that she completely understands him, although the other characters seemingly do not. That line was improvised by Aubrey Plaza, and later helped inspire the writing staff to place the April and Andy characters into a romantic relationship. Schur said of this, [...] "At the time, it was this little nothing, throwaway thing, but when we watched it, we thought <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> there." [...] The scene with Mark making a pass at Ann at the rock show, and Ann's angry reaction to the attempt, were a last-minute addition to the episode. Although Mark and Ann would develop a romantic relationship in the second season, the Parks and Recreation writers had not decided what would happen between the developing romantic plotlines between Leslie and Mark, or Leslie and Ann, at time [...] "Rock Show" [...] aired. In the original pilot script, Mark helped Leslie solely because he was attracted to Ann and felt that green-lighting Leslie's project would give him an excuse {{to spend more time}} with her; the shooting version was retooled to make Leslie less pathetic and Mark less unlikable, by having him won over by Leslie's determination to fight against the odds. Immediately after [...] "Rock Show" [...] was originally broadcast, NBC set up an official website for [...] "Scarecrow Boat", Andy's band featured in the episode. The site, at scarecrowboat.com, included ringtones, band posters, songs for download and photos.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} stated by Tom Searle {{that it is}} [...] "a bunch of atheists {{thinking}} {{about whether or not}} <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> bigger," [...] and that due to his cancer he was becoming highly contemplative about life, and that this album is the product of that train of thought.|$|E
6000|$|Isabel {{shook her}} head; <b>there</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>something</b> laughable {{in the fact}} that she did it with a touch of melancholy. [...] "I shall never make any one a martyr." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I don't see {{anything}} remarkable in the result. If {{she had put}} in crocodile's eggs and hatched out White Orpingtons, <b>there</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>something</b> to write to Country Life about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{appetite}} is {{very easily}} spoilt," [...] she said. [...] "I dare say <b>there</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>something</b> I didn't {{notice in the}} glass--or perhaps my taste {{may be out of}} order." ...|$|R
2500|$|Pelléas is {{relieved}} to breathe fresh air again. It is noon. He sees Geneviève and Mélisande at {{a window in}} the tower. Golaud tells Pelléas {{that there must be}} no repeat of the [...] "childish game" [...] between him and Mélisande last night. Mélisande is pregnant and the least shock might disturb her health. It {{is not the first time}} he has noticed <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> between Pelléas and Mélisande but Pelléas should avoid her as much as possible without making this look too obvious.|$|E
60|$|Arnold {{admitted}} that he thought that, after all, <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> {{to be said for}} it.|$|E
60|$|This was rank heresy to Felicity, but the Story Girl {{looked as}} if she thought <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> in it.|$|E
2500|$|... "The use of {{nolle prosequi}} {{to conceal the}} {{deficiencies}} of the prosection was an abuse of process, which left an innocent man under the suspicion that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>something</b> in the talk of mass murder after all" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have no {{intention}} of preaching socialism," [...] said Hodder. But he laid a slight emphasis on the word which sent a cold shiver down Mr. Plimpton's spine, and made him wonder whether <b>there</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>something</b> worse than socialism.|$|R
6000|$|It {{shows how}} much the ghastly blow I had {{received}} had shaken me when I say that, instead of dismissing the proposal with a curt [...] "Tchah!" [...] or anything like that, I found myself speculating as to whether <b>there</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>something</b> in it, after all.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a bit," [...] said Lilly, {{looking up}} over his spectacles. [...] "I very much wish <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> that held us together." ...|$|E
60|$|The bishop tried a few phrases. He thought <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> in co-operation, in profit-sharing, in {{some more}} {{permanent}} {{relationship between the}} business and the employee.|$|E
6000|$|... "It may be wicked of me," [...] said shrewd Kate, [...] "but I cannot help {{wishing that}} her mother may not be found. <b>There</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> unpleasant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Gently, gently. The chap hev {{done his}} {{duty as a}} sailor; and though <b>there</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>something</b> between him and Anne, her mother, in talking it over with me, has said many times that she couldn't think of their marrying till Bob had settled down in {{business}} with me. Folks that gain victories must have a little liberty allowed 'em. Look at the Admiral himself, for that matter.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, but I 'm disappointed. She won't let me in. She has {{locked the}} door, and I 'm afraid {{to make a}} noise." [...] I suppose <b>there</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>something</b> ridiculous in a {{confession}} of this kind, but I liked my new friend so much that for me it did n't detract from his dignity. [...] "She tells me--from behind the door--that she will {{let me know if}} he is worse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur, is de--de--" [...] but, {{breaking}} {{down at the}} very threshold in her English, she poured out a long ribbon of sparkling French, the purpose of which was to convey a profusion of fine compliments to the stranger, with many tender inquiries {{as to whether he}} was comfortably roomed, and whether <b>there</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>something,</b> however trifling, wanting to his complete accommodation. But Israel understood nothing, at the time, but the exceeding grace, and trim, bewitching figure of the girl.|$|R
60|$|After all, Kipps thought <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> {{to say for}} the milder project.... But he {{had gone}} so far that now {{he did not know}} how to say it.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's that," [...] said Tuppence suddenly, {{pointing}} to a small, old-fashioned safe let into the wall. [...] "It's for jewellery, I believe, but <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> else in it." ...|$|E
60|$|The chief clerk, with {{a little}} deprecatory cough, got close to the door as a dim idea that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> after all in Captain Trimblett’s {{warnings}} occurred to him.|$|E
60|$|There {{is no need}} {{to dwell}} on the proceedings. It was to Phoebe on a larger scale what she had {{previously}} gone through. She was too much occupied with the act before God and her neighbour to be self-conscious, or to think of the multitudes eagerly watching her young simple face, or listening to her grave clear tones. A dim perception crossed Lady Bannerman's mind that <b>there</b> really <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> in little Phoebe when she found the sheriff's wife, the grande dame of the hunting field, actually shedding tears of emotion.|$|R
60|$|There was, as yet, no {{practicable}} aviation to beguile a {{young man}} of spirit, but {{there were times when}} Benham found himself wondering whether <b>there</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>something</b> rather creditable in the possession and control of a motor-car of exceptional power. Only one might smash people up. Should an aristocrat be deterred by the fear of smashing people up? If it is a selfish fear of smashing people up, if it is nerves rather than pity? At any rate it did not come to the car.|$|R
6000|$|... "After all," [...] resumed Miriam, [...] "if a {{woman had}} painted the {{original}} picture, <b>there</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>something</b> in it which we miss now. I have a great mind to undertake a copy myself; and try to give it what it lacks. Well; goodby. But, stay! I am going for a little airing to {{the grounds of the}} Villa Borghese this afternoon. You will think it very foolish, but I always feel the safer in your company, Hilda, slender little maiden as you are. Will you come?" ...|$|R
60|$|Scott {{admitted}} that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> in the idea, and that, however foreign to his usual habits, Robinson might {{on this occasion}} be confining himself more or less to strict fact.|$|E
6000|$|Madame Merle {{looked as}} if she were ready to admit that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> in this; but in a moment she said quietly: [...] "You think me more calculating than I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Philip here, and Hartwell, {{have got}} it {{up against him}} hard. So have I. We think it's about time he was taught a lesson. <b>There</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> for you out of it." ...|$|E
60|$|Alaric {{began to}} feel uneasy, {{and to think that}} <b>there</b> <b>might</b> by {{possibility}} <b>be</b> <b>something</b> in what Neverbend had said to him. He did not like the idea of meeting a Cornish stock-jobber in a familiar way over his brandy-punch, while engaged, as he now was, on the part of Government; he felt that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> impropriety in it, and he would have been glad to get off if he could. But he felt ashamed to break his engagement, and thus followed Undy into the hotel.|$|R
6000|$|He stayed only {{a couple}} of days at Cheltenham and during that time said very little to her. He {{certainly}} spoke no word which would give her a right to think that he himself was attached to her. He had been interested about her, as was his aunt, Lady Ushant, because she had been known and her mother had been known by the old Mortons. But there was nothing of love in all that. She had never supposed that there would be;--and yet there was a vague feeling in her bosom that as he had been strong in expressing his objection to Mr. Twentyman <b>there</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>something</b> more to stir him than the memory of those old days at Bragton! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{were the}} morning and evening parades; and {{when one of the}} provincial loons--you'll know, Duncan, you're half a Scotsman yourself--when one of them dropped his powder over his porretch, if it touched the coals, it just burnt!" [...] Then {{suddenly}} changing his bitter, ironical manner, to one more grave and thoughtful, he continued; [...] "and yet <b>there</b> <b>might,</b> and must <b>be,</b> <b>something</b> in that letter which it would be well to know!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your letter? Oh, yes, I remember. I {{have not}} read it yet, Harry. I was afraid <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> {{in it that}} I wouldn't like. You cut life to pieces with your epigrams." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But {{it is all}} a vision!' said Havill, ruefully {{regarding}} the pencilled towers of Stancy Castle. 'If the competition were really the commission that you have represented it to be <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> to laugh at.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{possibility}} of hiring a [...] "reg'lar room" [...] {{at such a}} low price had never before entered his mind, and he feared <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> {{in regard to the}} transaction which was being kept a secret from him.|$|E
5000|$|I {{feel that}} there is a {{definitive}} explanation, but I like that people don't necessarily know what it is. In interviews we always said that we would tell people exactly what caused the plague. The thing was, we never said when we were going to tell. We weren't going to tell you when we were telling you, I should say. We might have told you in issue #3. <b>There</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>something</b> in the background that only a couple people caught. It <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> Dr. Mann's father's very detailed, scientific explanation. It <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> Alter's off-the-wall conspiracy theory. The real answer is somewhere in those 60 issues, but I prefer to let the reader decide which one they like rather than pushing it on them.|$|R
6000|$|... "You will hardly {{leave us}} yet, Jack," [...] said Rose, with a manner and {{emphasis}} {{that did not}} fail to strike her betrothed lover, though he could in no way account for either. That Rose should {{not wish to be}} left alone with him in that solitary place was natural enough; or, <b>might</b> rather <b>be</b> referred to education and the peculiar notions of her sex; but he could not understand why so much importance should be attached to the presence of a being of Jack Tier's mould and character. It was true, that there was little choice, under present circumstances, but it occurred to Mulford that Rose had manifested the same strange predilection when <b>there</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>something</b> nearer to a selection. The moment, however, was not one for much reflection on the subject.|$|R
5000|$|John Hannah {{has since}} claimed the series has been cancelled. [...] "I imagine that's dead. I think it's been too long. I loved that show. Charlie {{wanted to do}} more, {{everyone}} did. It was Sky I guess. <b>There</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>something</b> {{to do with the}} negotiations, I don't know. We did the first one, then they wanted a lot more and Charlie wasn't sure he could sustain it over twelve episodes. So we did two more and then by the third one, they had figured out what they were doing. I think it's dead, it's a couple of years since we did that now. Normally when these things go, they go pretty quickly because people have other commitments, and Charlie is busy. It's a real shame. I doubt I'll be playing DI McDoodah for the next few years!" ...|$|R
