40|$|Abstract — Electrical {{steel sheets}} play an {{important}} role in magnetic circuit core design of electrical machines. Electrical steel are graded depending on value of <b>specific</b> <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> (PS). According to the present knowledge the PS loss consists of three components: hysteresis loss and both classical and additional eddy current loss components. Magnetic properties depend on direction of magnetization i. e. magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The determination of the <b>specific</b> power <b>loss</b> separation of electrical steel sheets in different direction to rolling direction have been performed using non-standard single sheet tester. <b>Specific</b> <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> was separated into hysteresis, eddy current and excess loss components.

40|$|AbstractThe {{endogenous}} ileal {{amino acids}} recovered at the terminal ileum of monogastric animals comprises of two components, namely basal and <b>specific</b> <b>losses.</b> The basal losses are fixed and associated with feed dry matter intake, whereas the <b>specific</b> <b>losses</b> are variable and {{induced by the}} presence of dietary components, such as fibre and anti-nutrients. Currently there is no methodology available to directly measure the <b>specific</b> endogenous <b>losses.</b> These losses are calculated by determining the basal and <b>total</b> (basal plus <b>specific)</b> <b>losses</b> and then subtracting the basal losses from total losses. Two techniques, namely the guanidination and isotope markers, can be used for the determination of total endogenous amino acid losses. The fundamental features, specific applications and shortcomings of these two methodologies are discussed.

40|$|Electrical steel {{laminations}} used in {{the construction}} of transformer cores are subject to stresses introduced during their construction and analysis of the effect of this on the magnetostriction of the lamination has been investigated previously. It has been shown that higher harmonics of magnetostriction are of greater importance than the fundamental when considering transformer noise. Whereas previous studies have concentrated on the magnetostriction harmonics generated by sinusoidal magnetization, this investigation seeks to understand the relationship between harmonics present in the magnetization waveform and those in the magnetostriction waveform. A measurement system has been designed based on a similar principle to one previously described. In this case, a single Labview Virtual Instrument (VI) is used for the control of the applied stress, controlled magnetization and measurement of magnetostriction together with other magnetic parameters such as <b>specific</b> <b>total</b> <b>loss,</b> <b>specific</b> apparent power, permeability, coercivity and remanence. An adaptive digital feedback algorithm is utilized for control of arbitrary waveform which may be constructed from discrete harmonics or read from an input waveform. As well as measuring peak magnetostriction the software utilizes an FFT to calculate the harmonics of magnetostriction at each stress point. The effect of harmonics introduced into the magnetization waveform on the magnetostriction harmonics will be shown at various applied stresses. A harmonic, HarmB in the flux density waveform is shown to have the effect of producing a dominant harmonic in the magnetostriction given by (HarmB+ 1) / 2...|$|R
40|$|Deformation {{mechanism}} and dislocation dynamics in grain oriented electrical steel (GOES) {{is not well}} established during the continuous flattening anneal process. This work deals with the study of deformation mechanisms during {{the process and the}} effect of lattice defects created during the process on the final magnetic properties of GOES. A heat transfer model of the continuous flattening anneal furnace was developed to calculate the temperature profile of the strip throughout the process. The heat transfer model showed the stability of peak strip temperature at 850 oC when the line speed was varied from 60 - 90 m/min. A deformation mechanism map was constructed for two varieties of GOES. The main implication of this model is the knowledge of the effect of process parameters like stress, temperature and strain rate on the formation of dislocation structure in GOES during continuous flattening anneal process. LAFFAS (Lab Annealing Furnace for Flattening Anneal Simulation) was constructed to simulate the continuous flattening anneal process and produce samples for dislocation study and magnetic testing. The high temperature mechanical behaviour of Conventional Grain Oriented+ ® (CGO+ - new GOES product) and its effect on magnetic properties were also analysed. Polygonization in GOES and the factors affecting polygonization were studied in detail. Initial orientation of the grains was determined to be a rate controlling factor for degree of polygonization along with temperature and annealing time. The degree of polygonization was shown to be an important parameter affecting the change in domain width. A localised decrease in <b>specific</b> <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> was observed at 1. 5 T and 50 Hz in grains where polygonization was complete.

A clamping system was designed for application of artificial burrs in a completely repeatable and reversible manner. Various burr sizes and arrangements were investigated to confirm the effect and show {{the extent of the}} effect for different scenarios with the experimental core magnetised in the range of 0. 1 T to 1. 8 T. It was observed that for large number of laminations affected by the artificial burrs the overall core losses of the three phase, 350 kVA distribution transformer doubled while the local losses {{in the vicinity of the}} burred region reached over 1 kW/kg. Three eddy current loss models were developed in this investigation. One for a symmetrical case of burrs located on either edge of a stack of laminations, one for a non symmetrical case of burrs located on the edge or within the stack of laminations and finally, one taking into account flux density decay within a conductive material. A secondary objective of this thesis is a feasibility study of using thin film sensors within a commercial size transformer core. This was achieved by adapting a physical vapour deposition system to accommodate large laminations and depositing thin film needle sensors for flux density measurement and thin film thermocouples for loss measurement inside a stack of the core. The flux density measurement by thin film needle sensors within the core was successful. Thin film thermocouples did not provide successful results and the development of this part of the work is suggested as future work...|$|R

40|$|In {{the process}} of turbine modernizations, the {{investigation}} of the influences of water passage roughness on radial flow machine performance is crucial and validates the efficiency step up between reduced scale model and prototype. This study presents the <b>specific</b> <b>losses</b> per component of a Francis turbine, which are estimated by CFD simulation. Simulations are performed for different water passage surface roughness heights, which represents the equivalent sand grain roughness height. As a result, the boundary layer logarithmic velocity profile still exists for rough walls, but moves closer to the wall. Consequently, the wall friction depends not only on roughness height but also on its shape and distribution. The <b>specific</b> <b>losses</b> are determined by CFD numerical simulations for each component of the prototype, taking into account its own specific sand grain roughness height. The model efficiency step up between reduced scale model and prototype value is finally computed by the assessment of <b>specific</b> <b>losses</b> on prototype and by evaluating <b>specific</b> <b>losses</b> for a reduced scale model with smooth walls. Furthermore, surveys of rough walls of each component were performed during the geometry recovery on the prototype and comparisons are made with experimental data from the EPFL Laboratory for Hydraulic Machines reduced scale model measurements.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} density and {{cross-sectional}} area of axons in the optic nerve in elderly control subjects and {{in cases of}} Alzheimer's disease (AD) using an image analysis system. Methods: Sections of optic nerves from control and AD patients were stained with toluidine blue to reveal axon profiles. Results: The density of axons was reduced in both the center and peripheral portions of the optic nerve in AD compared with control patients. Analysis of axons with different cross-sectional areas suggested a <b>specific</b> <b>loss</b> of the smaller sized axons in AD, i. e., those with areas less that 1. 99 μm 2.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} impact of edge burr faults on total power loss in {{electrical}} machine core laminations. Analytical techniques, experimental work and FEM modelling have been utilised to investigate {{the effect of the}} phenomenon from different aspects. Measurements of overall <b>specific</b> <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> and analytical techniques were used to separate the power loss components over wide magnetising frequency ranges. Two techniques were used in this project for edge burr simulation; these include (1) the short circuiting of two Epstein-size and three Epstein-size and large-size, non-oriented steel laminations by lead-free solder in the rolling and transverse directions and (2) the by clamping system method, which was designed for the application of edge burrs on toroid cores. Various sizes of artificial edge burrs were applied at set points and then in a random manner to confirm their effect and show the extent of their effect in different case scenarios and the tests were completely repeatable. 3 -D FEM modelling for toroid cores was also used to study {{the impact of}} core geometry on the total core loss. This method provided a clear explanation for why smaller toroid cores have higher power loss than the larger ones. The research presented in this thesis can be utilised by electrical steel manufacturers and electrical machine designers to evaluate the impact of edge burr faults on the properties of magnetic cores. The evaluation is beneficial because it could reduce the risk of local overheating of laminated magnetic material, which can lead to destruction of such an electrical machine...|$|R
40|$|A {{quantitative}} approach for landslide risk assessment along transportation lines is presented {{and applied to}} a road and a railway alignment in the Nilgiri hills in southern India. The method allows estimating direct risk affecting the alignments, vehicles and people, and indirect risk resulting from the disruption of economic activities. The data required for the risk estimation were obtained from historical records. A total of 901 landslides were catalogued initiating from cut slopes along the railway and road alignment. The landslides were grouped into three magnitude classes based on the landslide type, volume, scar depth, run-out distance, etc and their probability of occurrence was obtained using frequency-volume distribution. Hazard, for a given return period, expressed {{as the number of}} landslides of a given magnitude class per kilometre of cut slopes, was obtained using Gumbel distribution and probability of landslide magnitude. In <b>total</b> 18 <b>specific</b> hazard scenarios were generated using the three magnitude classes and six return periods (1, 3, 5, 15, 25, and 50 years). The assessment of the vulnerability of the road and railway line was based on damage records whereas the vulnerability of different types of vehicles and people was subjectively assessed based on limited historic incidents. Direct <b>specific</b> <b>loss</b> for the alignments (railway line and road), vehicles (train, bus, lorry, car and motorbike) was expressed in monetary value (US$), and direct <b>specific</b> <b>loss</b> of life of commuters was expressed in annual probability of death. Indirect <b>specific</b> <b>loss</b> (US$) derived from the traffic interruption was evaluated considering alternative driving routes, and includes losses resulting from additional fuel consumption, additional travel cost, loss of income to the local business, and loss of revenue to the railway department. The results indicate that the total loss, including both direct and indirect loss, from 1 to 50 years return period, varies from US$ 90 840 to US$ 779 500 and the average annual total loss was estimated as US$ 35 000. The annual probability of a person most at risk travelling in a bus, lorry, car, motorbike and train is less than 10 - 4 /annum in all the time periods considered.
