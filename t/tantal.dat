25|$|The karabinek wzór 1988 (Carbine Model 1988) <b>Tantal</b> is a 5.45×39mm {{assault rifle}} {{designed}} and produced in Poland {{in the late}} 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Tantal</b> {{features}} a metal wire side-folding stock (folds {{to the right}} side), ended with a profiled shoulder pad. The rifle can also use a fixed wooden or synthetic buttstock designed for AKM or AK-74 rifles. Both {{the upper and lower}} handguard and pistol grip are fabricated from bakelite, although a limited number of Tantal-specific black polymer handguards and pistol grips have also been produced. Most handguards designed for use with the wz. 1996 Beryl assault rifle may also be installed on the <b>Tantal.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>Tantal</b> {{was used}} to develop the Onyks carbine, the karabinek-granatnik wz. 1974 rifle/grenade {{launcher}} combination and a “night” variant of the wz. 1988, equipped with a receiver side-rail used to mount an NSP-3 night sight (or Polish PCS-5 night sight).|$|E

50|$|The 457 mm-long barrel, has six {{right-hand}} grooves and a 228 mm (1:9 in) twist rate. The barrel’s {{external profile}} (from the breech {{to the front}} sight base) {{is identical to the}} <b>Tantal’s</b> barrel, but the length from the foresight base has a visible tapered contour with a decreasing diameter towards the muzzle end, used to mount a flash suppressor.|$|R
40|$|Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit war es, höhervalente Imido- und Amidoverbindungen des Niobs und <b>Tantals</b> zu synthetisieren und deren Reaktivität gegenüber Phosphoryliden zu untersuchen. Klassische Phosphorylid-Komplexe des Typs [LnM-CHR-PR' 3] (R = Alkyl, Aryl, etc.) sind in der Literatur zahlreiche beschrieben. Metall-substituierte Phosphorylide, so genannte a-Phosphoniomethyliden-Komplexe der Art [LnM=CH-PR 3] sind dagegen vergleichsweise wenig untersucht, wobei sich die Arbeiten vor allem mit tetravalenten Metallocenderivaten der 4. Gruppe, des Urans sowie im eigenen Arbeitskreis mit den Elementen der VI. Nebengruppe und des Rheniums beschäftigen. Vertreter von Imidoyl-substituierten Ylidkomplexen des Niobs und <b>Tantals,</b> die isolobal zu den Metallocenen der IV. Nebengruppe und der Diimide der VI. Nebengruppe sind, waren dagegen zu Beginn dieser Studien gänzlich unbekannt. Im Vergleich zu den im eigenen Arbeitskreis hergestellten Molybdän- und Wolframverbindungen der allgemeinen Zusammensetzung [M(NtBu) 2 (CHPR 3) R'] sollten Komplexe der 5. Gruppe [(h 5 -C 5 R 5) M(NtBu) (CHPR 3) R'] noch stärker polare und daher reaktivere Metall-Kohlenstoff-Bindungen enthalten. Diese galt es zu synthetisieren und in ihrer Reaktivität zu untersuchen. Die in dieser Arbeit beschriebenen Verbindungen umfassen Halbsandwichkomplexe des Typs [(h 5 -C 5 R 5) M(NtBu) R' 2] (M = Nb, Ta; R = H, Me), Metallocen-Imide [(h 5 -C 5 H 5) 2 M(NtBu) Cl], Imido-verbrückten d 1 -Dimere [(h 5 -C 5 H 5) M(m-NtBu) Cl] 2, a-Phosphonio(methyliden) -Komplexe, den Bis-a-phosphonio(methyliden) -Komplex [(h 5 -C 5 Me 5) Nb(NtBu) (CHPPh 2 Me) 2], Ylid-Addukte [(h 5 -C 5 Me 5) MCl 4 (CH 2 PPh 3) ], h 2 -Iminoacyl-, h 2 -Acyl-, Carboxylato-, Dithiocarboxylato-Komplexe gebildet durch Insertionsreaktionen an Ylid- und Amido-Komplexen, Biaryl-Metallacyclen durch Insertion von Ylid- und Amidokomplexen in diastereotope Biaryllactone, Bisimido-Tantalmetallate, Imido-Amido-Pyridin-Addukte [M(NtBu) (NHtBu) Cl 2 py 2], der tris-Phosphonio(methyliden) -Komplex [Ta(NtBu) (CHPPh 3) 3. Targets of {{this thesis}} were the {{synthesis}} of high-valent imido and amido complexes of niobium and tantalum and the investigation of their reactivity towards phosphorus ylides. Transition metal complexes with neutral phosphorous ylide ligands [LnM-CHR-PR' 3] (R = alkyl, aryl, etc.) are {{well known in the}} literature. Contrastingly, very little is known about metal substituted phosphorus ylides of the type [LnM=CH-PR 3]. The chemistry of these so called a-phosphonio(methylidene) complexes is mainly focused on tetravalent metallocene derivatives of group 4, of uranium - and in the own scientific group - on the elements of group 6 and on rhenium. Ylide complexes of niobium and tantalum with organoimido ligands which are isolobal with metallocenes of group 4 and with bis-imido complexes of group 6 have been completely unknown at the beginning of these studies. With respect to molybdenum and tungsten complexes of the general formula [M(NtBu) 2 (CHPR 3) R'] which have been prepared by our own group complexes of group 5 [(h 5 -C 5 R 5) M(NtBu) (CHPR 3) R'] should bare a more polar and therefore more reactive metal-carbon-bond. The compounds described in this presentation comprise half sandwich complexes [(h 5 -C 5 R 5) M(NtBu) R’ 2], metallocen-imido complexes [(h 5 -C 5 H 5) 2 M(NtBu) Cl], dinuclear complexes with bridging imido ligands [(h 5 -C 5 H 5) M(m-NtBu) Cl] 2, a-phosphonio(methylidene) complexes, the bis-a-phosphonio(methyliden) complex [(h 5 -C 5 Me 5) Nb(NtBu) (CHPPh 2 Me) 2], ylide-adducts [(h 5 -C 5 Me 5) MCl 4 (CH 2 PPh 3) ], h 2 -iminoacyl-, h 2 -acyl-, carboxylato-, dithiocarboxylato-complexes formed via insertion reactions in ylide and amido complexes, biaryl metallacycles via insertion of ylide and amido complexes in diastereotopic biaryl lactones, bisimido tantalum metallates, imido amido pyridine adducts [M(NtBu) (NHtBu) Cl 2 py 2], the tris-phosphonio(methyliden) complex [Ta(NtBu) (CHPPh 3) 3...|$|R

50|$|The kbs wz. 1996 Beryl (English: beryllium) is a Polish 5.56mm assault rifle, {{designed}} and {{produced by the}} Łucznik Arms Factory {{in the city of}} Radom. The rifle is to replace the 7.62×39mm AKM and 5.45×39mm FB <b>Tantal</b> used in the Polish Armed Forces.|$|E
50|$|The carbine has an {{identical}} design layout, system of operation, locking mechanism {{and uses the}} same type of ammunition as the <b>Tantal</b> rifle, and the main modifications include the following components: the barrel, bolt carrier and piston rod, gas cylinder, foregrip, heatguard, muzzle device and iron sights.|$|E
50|$|The Beryl’s {{design layout}} and system of {{operation}} {{are similar to}} those of the <b>Tantal</b> rifle, and the principal differences, resulting primarily from using a different cartridge, include the following components: the barrel, receiver housing, buttstock, foregrip, muzzle device, sight system and magazine. With an adapter, it can use M16 NATO standard magazine.|$|E
50|$|The carbine {{also has}} a {{different}} sighting arrangement than the <b>Tantal</b> rifle, with a newly designed rear sight. The open-type flip sight with both 100-200 and 400 m settings is installed {{at the rear of}} an extended sight rail protected by ears, which is riveted to the rear sight base. The sight has two settings, “1 i 2” and “4” (that correspond to firing ranges from 100 to 200 m and 400 m respectively). The flip sight locks in position with a spring detent. The adjustable front sight post is screwed into the front sight base that is installed in the gas block. The Onyks can be fitted with tritium night sights, similar to those used in the wz. 88 <b>Tantal.</b> Recesses cut into both sides of the sight rail are used to mount optical sights.|$|E
50|$|Equipment {{supplied}} with the <b>Tantal</b> includes: three spare magazines, a 6H4 type bayonet with scabbard, bipod, four 15-round stripper clips (they enable rapid magazine charging), a stripper clip guide, cleaning kit, sling, magazine pouch and a lubricant bottle.

50|$|It is {{a grenade}} caliber {{designed}} in Poland, {{and used in}} Pallad wz. 74 underbarrel grenade launchers (used with AK family rifles in use in Polish Army like the AKM/AKMS, <b>Tantal</b> and Beryl) and Pallad-D wz. 83 Grenade launcher (standalone variant fitted with standard pistol grip and folding stock from AKMS assault rifle). The construction is similar to one used in 40×46mm but grenades are not fully interchangeable.|$|E
50|$|Compared to the <b>Tantal,</b> the Onyks {{features}} a barrel reduced in length by 216 mm, {{fitted with a}} different type of muzzle device. Due to the barrel’s length, this device is primarily used to reduce muzzle flash, {{but it can also be}} used to mount and launch rifle grenades. At its muzzle end, the device has a conical flash hider, and on its tapered, external surface - a retainer spring and two collars, used to attach and guide rifle grenades.|$|E

50|$|The Beryl’s {{sighting}} system {{is very similar}} to the setup used on the <b>Tantal,</b> it does however differ with the addition of twin cuts made into the sides of rear sight base that are used to fasten a bracket for mounting the following optical sights: the passive PCS-6 night sight, a CK-3 reflex optical collimator (red dot sight), LKA-4 telescopic sight and CWL-1 scope with integrated laser rangefinder. However, the most used additional sight for Beryl is EOTech 552 holographic weapon sight and PCS-5M passive night sight. PCS-6 and CWL-1 are introduced in small number.|$|E
50|$|The 5.45 mm subkarabinek wz. 1989 Onyks is a {{lightweight}} Polish carbine {{variant of the}} 5.45 mm wz. 1988 <b>Tantal</b> assault rifle, also based on the AK(S)-74U Work on the weapon began in 1989 at the Ośrodek Badawczo-Rozwojowy state research institute {{in the city of}} Radom. The weapon’s technical specifications were confirmed that same year. It was not until 1990 that production approval was given for the first prototypes, evaluated the following year in a series of military qualification tests resulting in an order for an initial pre-production batch in 1993, to be manufactured at the Łucznik Arms Factory in Radom.|$|E
50|$|Development {{work on a}} {{new service}} rifle (both a {{standard}} and carbine variant) adapted to use the intermediate 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge had been undertaken in 1995, however a functioning 5.56 mm rifle and carbine variant had already been available in Radom since 1991, known as the wz. 1991 (a rechambered wz. 1988 <b>Tantal</b> rifle). The new weapon’s specifications were approved in February 1995 and in December the same year, a prototype production batch consisting of 11 Beryl rifles was produced. In 1997 the weapon had been successfully evaluated and adopted into service as the 5,56 mm karabinek szturmowy wz. 1996 ("assault carbine pattern 1996").|$|E
5000|$|His {{most notable}} science fiction works are {{a series of}} novels, the Pelbar Cycle, set in North America about a {{thousand}} years after a [...] "time of fire", in which the world was nearly totally depopulated. The novels track a gradual reconnection of the human cultures which developed. Much of the action takes place in the communities of the Pelbar, along the Upper Mississippi River — in the general vicinity of Elsah. Several cultures, including the matriarchal Pelbar, join together in the Heart River Federation. Others, especially the tyrannical <b>Tantal</b> and slave-raiding Tusco, fall apart after suffering defeats. The predominant characters are change agents: Tor, Jestak, Stel and his wife Ahroe Westrun. All are Pelbar except for Tor who is Shumai. Williams won the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer in Science Fiction in 1983.|$|E
5000|$|Examples of {{well known}} {{companies}} are (or were) Corgi Toys, Dinky Toys, Matchbox, and Spot-On Models of the United Kingdom; Solido, Norev, and Majorette of France; Schuco Modell, Gama, and Siku of (West) Germany; Tekno of Denmark, and Mercury, Polistil and Mebetoys of Italy. Immediately post-war, Belgium made Septoy and Gasquy. Even Israel {{got into the}} act quite successfully with Gamda Koor Sabra which made its own tooling for several unique models. Non-market system communist countries also had some successful factories, like Kaden models and Igra of Czechoslovakia, Espewe of East Germany, and Estetyka of Poland. State factories of the Soviet Union (commonly known as Novoexport, Saratov, or <b>Tantal)</b> produced many carefully crafted diecast models mostly in 1:43 scale. These were known for their intricate detail, numerous parts, and delicate construction. Larger sizes in die-cast grew out of offerings of European companies like Polistil, Schuco Modell, and Martoys, which was later to become Bburago. 1:24 and 1:18 scales did not become really popular until the late 1980s when other brands like Yatming and Maisto were produced in Hong Kong or China by either American or Asian companies. 1:87 scale plastic vehicles, related to railroad modeling or not, also continue to be popular in Europe. Despite continued European companies, today, China is now the center of diecast production.Post-war European diecast models were produced in fairly simple form, such as Dinky Toys (often in the train related 1:64 or 1:43). Dinky production began in 1934, while Matchbox cars (often approx. 1:64) were introduced in the mid-1950s. These early die-cast toys featured no opening parts whatsoever. Affected by market forces and by improvements in production technology, companies began {{to improve the quality}} of the toys over time. The [...] "best" [...] improvements were often copied by the competition within 1-2 years of their appearance on the market. Examples of these would be plastic windows, interiors, separate wheel/tire assemblies, working suspensions, opening/moving parts, jeweled headlights, mask-spraying or tampo-printing, and low-friction 'fast' wheels.Into the 1970s, model makers began to feel the squeeze of rising costs. Often press tooling for a new model might cost more than 30,000 pounds (more than 50,000 USD). Companies began to offer fewer new issues and the models became simpler with fewer opening parts (Harvey 1974, p. 1998).|$|E
