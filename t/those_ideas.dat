5|$|Barbara McClintock (June 16, 1902 – September 2, 1992) was an American {{scientist}} and cytogeneticist who {{was awarded the}} 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. McClintock received her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927. There she started her career as the leader {{in the development of}} maize cytogenetics, the focus of her research {{for the rest of her}} life. From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize. She developed the technique for visualizing maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas. One of <b>those</b> <b>ideas</b> was the notion of genetic recombination by crossing-over during meiosis—a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. She produced the first genetic map for maize, linking regions of the chromosome to physical traits. She demonstrated the role of the telomere and centromere, regions of the chromosome that are important in the conservation of genetic information. She was recognized among the best in the field, awarded prestigious fellowships, and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Josquin lived {{during a}} {{transitional}} stage in music history. Musical styles were changing rapidly, in part {{owing to the}} movement of musicians between different regions of Europe. Many northern musicians moved to Italy, {{the heart of the}} Renaissance, attracted by the Italian nobility's patronage of the arts; while in Italy, these composers were influenced by the native Italian styles, and often brought <b>those</b> <b>ideas</b> with them back to their homelands. The sinuous musical lines of the Ockeghem generation, the contrapuntal complexity of the Netherlanders, and the homophonic textures of the Italian lauda and secular music began to merge into a unified style; indeed Josquin was to be the leading figure in this musical process, which eventually resulted in the formation of an international musical language, of which the most famous composers included Palestrina and Lassus.|$|E
5|$|Manuel Belgrano had a vast {{intellectual}} {{awareness of}} most important topics of his age. He studied in Europe during the Atlantic Revolutions, {{and was a}} versatile polyglot, capable of understanding Spanish, English, French, Italian, and some indigenous languages. This allowed him to read many influential books of the Age of Enlightenment, and understand the social, economic, technical, educative, political, cultural, and religious changes that were being prompted by the new ideas. He helped to promote <b>those</b> <b>ideas</b> using the press and with {{his work in the}} Consulate. He rejected localist perspectives, favouring a Latin Americanist one. He was driven by the concept of the common good, which he regarded as an ethical value. He considered public health, education, and work as part of the common good, as well as religion. He did not share completely the ideas of the French Revolution, but instead the tempered ones of the Spanish Enlightenment: most notably, he remained a monarchist and held strong religious beliefs, being Roman Catholic and a devotee of Marian theology. His monarchism was not a conservative one, as he agreed that the existing state of things should be modified, but not towards a republic as in France or the United States, but towards a constitutional monarchy, like in Britain.|$|E

5|$|The game's setting, Kyrat, is {{a fictional}} {{country in the}} Himalayas region. When {{building}} Kyrat, the developers merged elements from real-world regions including Nepal and Tibet, but exaggerated those elements. The map's size {{is similar to that}} of Far Cry 3, but is more dense, diverse, and features more varied environments. The developers hoped that players could experience a sense of exploration when traveling between the different terrains. The team also hoped that the new location could be believable, while remaining interesting for players. As a result, they created an identify for Kyrat by doing such things as adding different signboards to the game and creating a fictional mythology and religion for Kyrat. The game's world was also designed to accommodate new features such as the helicopter and the grappling hook. In an effort to make the world feel real, the team added improvements to the design of side-quests. Instead of simply being activities for players to complete, the quests are narrative-driven, which was done to increase the connection between them and the world. In order to increase the credibility of the game's world, the studio sent a team to Nepal to experience and record the local culture, so that they could bring <b>those</b> <b>ideas</b> back to the studio. According to the developer, the trip changed the game's design; the focus shifted from the game's civil war, which is inspired by the real-world Nepalese Civil War, to developing unique and interesting characters.|$|E

25|$|Having left Germany and Romania {{during the}} Great War, the artists found {{themselves}} in Switzerland, a country recognized for its neutrality. Inside this space of political neutrality they decided to use abstraction {{to fight against the}} social, political, and cultural ideas of that time. The Dadaists believed <b>those</b> <b>ideas</b> to be a byproduct of bourgeois society, a society so apathetic it would rather fight a war against itself than challenge the status quo.|$|E
25|$|Adventitious {{ideas are}} those {{concepts}} that we gain through sense experiences, ideas {{such as the}} sensation of heat, because they originate from outside sources; transmitting their own likeness rather than something else and something you simply cannot will away.

Lastly, innate ideas, such as our ideas of perfection, are <b>those</b> <b>ideas</b> we have {{as a result of}} mental processes that are beyond what experience can directly or indirectly provide.|$|E

25|$|The years 1815–1835 saw much {{political}} and social turmoil in Britain, not least in the medical profession. There were radical medical students and campaigners in both Edinburgh and London, the two main training centres for the profession at the time. Many of these were materialists who held views favouring evolution, but of a Lamarckian or Geoffroyan kind. It is the allegiance to hard inheritance or to natural selection which distinguishes Lawrence, Prichard and Wells, because <b>those</b> <b>ideas</b> have survived, and {{are part of the}} present-day account of evolution.|$|E
25|$|Early in the 20th century, Gerald Massey {{argued that}} there are {{similarities}} between the Egyptian god Horus and Jesus. Following <b>those</b> <b>ideas,</b> in the 1940s Alvin Boyd Kuhn suggested that not only Christianity, but Judaism was based on Egyptian concepts, and more recently Tom Harpur (a former Anglican priest who explained in his book The Pagan Christ that he believes in a spiritual Christ, but doubts that a historical Jesus existed) has expressed similar views. Harpur acknowledges Massey and Kuhn as his intellectual predecessors and theologian Stanley E. Porter states that most of Harpur's work is directly based on quoting Massey and Kuhn.|$|E
25|$|Although {{his work}} in the field was revolutionary, Goddard {{received}} very little public support for his research and development work. The press sometimes ridiculed his theories of spaceflight. As a result, he became protective of his privacy and his work. Years after his death, {{at the dawn of the}} Space Age, he came to be recognized as one of the founding fathers of modern rocketry, along with Robert Esnault-Pelterie, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, and Hermann Oberth. He not only recognized the potential of rockets for atmospheric research, ballistic missiles and space travel but was the first to scientifically study, design and construct the rockets needed to implement <b>those</b> <b>ideas.</b>|$|E

25|$|Gerald Cohen, in {{his essay}} 'Complete Bullshit', has cited the 'Althusserian school' {{as an example of}} 'bullshit' and a factor in his co-founding the 'Non-Bullshit Marxism Group'. He says that 'the ideas that the Althusserians generated, for example, of the {{interpellation}} of the subject, or of contradiction and overdetermination, possessed a surface allure, but it often seemed impossible {{to determine whether or not}} the theses in which <b>those</b> <b>ideas</b> figured were true, and, at other times, those theses seemed capable of just two interpretations: on one of them they were true but uninteresting, and, on the other, they were interesting, but quite obviously false'.|$|E
25|$|This LTM availability/accessibility {{dichotomy}} {{is analogous}} to a more contemporary explanation of Plato's doctrine of reminiscence, which postulates that an individual hedge {{as a result of}} information carried over from past lives. While evidence for or against immortality is outside the bounds of scientific research, one can see similarities between LTM availability/accessibility and the doctrine of reminiscence. LTM availability is highly unrestricted and practically unlimited as a storage system while LTM accessibility corresponds to what we can actually recall at any given moment. Plato, through his doctrine of reminiscence, would say that knowledge available through reminiscence is practically unrestricted but we are not cognizant of many of <b>those</b> <b>ideas</b> because they have yet to be recalled.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} this period of recuperation, however, that Goddard began to produce some of his most {{important}} work. As his symptoms subsided, he allowed himself to work an hour per day with his notes made at Princeton. In the technological and manufacturing atmosphere of Worcester, patents were considered essential, not only to protect original work, but as documentation of first discovery. He began to see the importance of his ideas as intellectual property, and thus began to secure <b>those</b> <b>ideas</b> before someone else did—and he would have to pay to use them. In May 1913, he wrote concerning his first rocket patent applications. His father brought them to a patent firm in Worcester, who helped him to refine his ideas for consideration. Goddard's first patent application was submitted in October 1913.|$|E

25|$|Legenden om Ljusets rike or Sagnet om Lysets rike in some Scandinavian {{language}} (in English The Legend of the Realm of Light; {{this novel}} {{has not been}} translated into English) {{is a set of}} fantasy novels by Norwegian-Swedish writer Margit Sandemo. It includes twenty titles. This set of novels can be read in Norwegian, Swedish, Icelandic and Polish. Margit Sandemo says that she wrote this series of novels because she wanted, like many other fiction writers, to portray her own view about an idealized world. Another reason to write Legenden om Ljusets rike was for the character called Marco who Sandemo created in the end of The Legend of the Ice People. She was so fond of him that she wanted to write more about Marco in the following series of novels. <b>Those</b> <b>ideas</b> took shape in her mind when she had written around half of Häxmästaren.|$|E
25|$|Antitheism {{is direct}} {{opposition}} to theism. As such, {{it is generally}} manifested more as an opposition to belief in a god (to theism per se) than as opposition to gods themselves, making it more associated with antireligion, although Buddhism is {{generally considered to be}} a religion despite its status with respect to theism being more nebulous. Antitheism by this definition does not necessarily imply belief in any sort of god at all, it simply stands in opposition to the idea of theistic religion. Under this definition, antitheism is a rejection of theism that does not necessarily imply belief in gods {{on the part of the}} antitheist. Some might equate any form of antitheism to an overt opposition to God, since these beliefs run contrary to the idea of making devotion to God the highest priority in life, although <b>those</b> <b>ideas</b> would imply that God exists, and that he wishes to be worshiped, or to be believed in.|$|E
