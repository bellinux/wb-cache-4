25|$|<b>The</b> <b>following</b> <b>text</b> is from Alexanders saga, an Alexander romance. The manuscript, AM 519 a 4to, is dated c. 1280. The {{facsimile}} {{demonstrates the}} sigla used by scribes to write Old Norse. Many {{of these were}} borrowed from Latin. Without familiarity with these abbreviations, the facsimile will be unreadable to many. In addition, reading the manuscript itself requires familiarity with the letterforms of the native script. The abbreviations are expanded in a version with normalized spelling like the standard normalization system's. Comparing this to the spelling of the same text in Modern Icelandic shows that, while pronunciation has changed greatly, spelling has changed little.|$|E

The {{prescribed}} readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle to the Galatians, Paul's teaching on law and promise (...) , and from the Gospel of Luke, the parable of the Good Samaritan (...) [...] The cantata text was written by Johann Oswald Knauer and appeared in Gotha in 1720 in [...] (Holy singing and playing to God). The text relates closely to the readings, even to the situation in which the parable was told, referring to the question of a lawyer {{what needs to be done}} to achieve eternal life. The answer, which the lawyer had to give himself, was the commandment to love God and your neighbour. This, the Great Commandment, is the text of the first movement.

500|$|Davis {{verbally}} {{committed to}} Kentucky on August 13, 2010, choosing {{it over his}} other finalists, which were DePaul, Ohio State, and Syracuse. He had officially visited DePaul and Ohio State. On August 24, 2010, he became the number one rated player in the national class of 2011 at Scout.com. [...] The pay-for-play scandal had played out very publicly in the press. Before Davis committed to Kentucky, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that his father, Anthony Davis, Sr. asked Kentucky for $200,000 for a commitment from his son. The report was initially released on Wednesday August 4, 2010 by Sun-Times reporter Michael O'Brien. Citing [...] "a reliable source", he posted <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>text</b> [...] "rumors/sources that have Davis choosing Kentucky are also alleging that the commitment cost $200,000." [...] before it was edited to say [...] "rumors that Davis' commitment is for sale have surfaced since he cut his list of schools down about a month ago." [...] and then removed later that day from the Sun-Times high school sports website following a threat from a University of Kentucky lawyer. A Lexington, Kentucky law firm sent a letter under the signature of attorney Stephen L. Barker that expressed a [...] "formal demand that you (O'Brien and the Sun-Times) withdraw the publication from any source from which it has been published, and issue an immediate statement that you know of no credible evidence indicating {{that there is any}} truth to the 'rumors' referred to in your article." [...] Baker's letter also threatened potential [...] "punitive damages for your malicious and willful actions." [...] Anthony Davis Sr. declined to speak to the Chicago Tribune on August 4 regarding the allegation, although he denied the allegations to the Sun-Times stating [...] "We haven't asked anyone for anything, and no one has offered us anything", on July 30 before the story broke.|$|E
