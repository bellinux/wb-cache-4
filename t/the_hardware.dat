5|$|The {{game was}} envisioned {{to take full}} {{advantage}} of <b>the</b> <b>hardware,</b> without the imposition of porting to older platforms like the PlayStation 3. <b>The</b> <b>hardware</b> let developers improve the particle system that lights Delsin's face up while he draws neon power from billboards and add detailed reflections to the game world. The increased memory bandwidth let the team render characters with higher fidelity. They found the PS4's simplified architecture so easy to work with that they were able to reach very high graphical quality even though <b>the</b> <b>hardware</b> was new.|$|E

5|$|NeXT {{withdrew from}} <b>the</b> <b>hardware</b> {{business}} in 1993 {{and the company}} was renamed NeXT Software Inc; consequently, 300 of the 540 staff employees were laid off. NeXT negotiated to sell <b>the</b> <b>hardware</b> business, including the Fremont factory, to Canon. Canon later {{pulled out of the}} deal. Work on the PowerPC machines was stopped, along with all hardware production. CEO of Sun Microsystems Scott McNealy announced plans to invest $10million in 1993 and use NeXT software (OpenStep) in future Sun systems. NeXT partnered with Sun to create OpenStep which was NeXTSTEP without the Mach-based kernel.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, Canon {{invested}} US$100million in NeXT, {{giving it}} a 16.67percent stake, making NeXT worth almost $600million. Canon invested in NeXT with the condition {{that it would be}} able to use the NeXTSTEP environment with its own workstations, which would mean a greatly expanded market for the software. After NeXT exited <b>the</b> <b>hardware</b> business, Canon produced a line of PCs, called object.station, including models 31, 41, 50 and 52, specifically designed to run NeXTSTEP/Intel. Canon also served as NeXT's distributor in Japan.|$|E
5|$|NeXT later {{released}} {{much of the}} NeXTSTEP {{system as}} a programming environment standard called OpenStep. NeXT withdrew from <b>the</b> <b>hardware</b> business in 1993 to concentrate on marketing OPENSTEP for Mach, its own OpenStep implementation, for several OEMs. NeXT also developed WebObjects, {{one of the first}} enterprise Web application frameworks. WebObjects never became very popular because of its initial high price of $50,000, but it remains a prominent early example of a Web server based on dynamic page generation rather than on static content.|$|E

5|$|Parallel {{computers}} can be roughly classified {{according to the}} level at which <b>the</b> <b>hardware</b> supports parallelism, with multi-core and multi-processor computers having multiple processing elements within a single machine, while clusters, MPPs, and grids use multiple computers to work on the same task. Specialized parallel computer architectures are sometimes used alongside traditional processors, for accelerating specific tasks.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computers}} can be roughly classified {{according to the}} level at which <b>the</b> <b>hardware</b> supports parallelism. This classification is broadly analogous to the distance between basic computing nodes. These are not mutually exclusive; for example, clusters of symmetric multiprocessors are relatively common.|$|E
5|$|Since the RAM and {{the hard}} drive on some generations of MacBook Pro are user {{serviceable}} parts, there are aftermarket modifications to enhance the system with up to 16GB of DDR3-1600 RAM (maximum capacity and frequency depend on <b>the</b> <b>hardware</b> in question), 7200-rpm hard drives or third party SSDs.|$|E

50|$|Nitris DNA: Developed by Avid, <b>the</b> Nitris <b>hardware</b> was {{probably}} <b>the</b> largest <b>hardware</b> update to <b>the</b> system {{since it was}} released. 10-bit HD and SD support was standard.

It is not known how the constant was originally derived, though investigation has {{shed some light on}} possible methods.|$|E
5|$|The {{computer}} command subsystem (CCS) {{controls the}} cameras.
