The comparison was made taking into account the common rules (Pravilnik 2007), in order to ensure uniform classification categories of land use. The data was compared in the ArcGis software environment, which provided the images of basic and detailed land use, together with the value of each category of land uses.

40|$|Although healthy preterm infants {{frequently}} {{seem to be}} more {{attentive to}} visual stimuli and to fix on them longer than full-term infants, no difference in visual acuity has been reported compared to term infants. We evaluated the contrast sensitivity (CS) function of term (N = 5) and healthy preterm (N = 11) infants at 3 and 10 months of life using sweep-visual evoked potentials. Two spatial frequencies were studied: low (0. 2 cycles per degrees, cpd) and medium (4. 0 cpd). The mean contrast sensitivity (expressed in percentage of contrast) of the preterm infants at 3 months was 55. 4 for <b>the</b> low <b>spatial</b> frequency (0. 2 cpd) and 43. 4 for <b>the</b> medium <b>spatial</b> frequency (4. 0 cpd). At 10 months <b>the</b> low <b>spatial</b> CS was 52. 7 and <b>the</b> medium <b>spatial</b> CS was 9. 9. The results for the term infants at 3 months were 55. 1 for <b>the</b> low <b>spatial</b> frequency and 34. 5 for <b>the</b> medium <b>spatial</b> frequency. At 10 months the equivalent values were 54. 3 and 14. 4, respectively. No difference was found using the Mann-Whitney rank sum T-test between term and preterm infants for the low frequency at 3 or 10 months or for <b>the</b> medium <b>spatial</b> frequency at 3 or 10 months. The development of CS for <b>the</b> medium <b>spatial</b> frequency was equally fast for term and preterm infants. As also observed for visual acuity, CS was equivalent among term and preterm infants, suggesting that visual experience does not modify the development of the primary visual pathway. An earlier development of synapses in higher cortical visual areas of preterm infants could explain the better use of visual information observed behaviorally in these infants...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} known that topologically {{different}} proteins of the same class sometimes share <b>the</b> same <b>spatial</b> arrangement of secondary structure elements (SSEs). However, the frequency by which topologically different structures share <b>the</b> same <b>spatial</b> arrangement of SSEs is unclear. It is important to estimate this frequency because it provides both {{a deeper understanding of}} the geometry of protein folds and a valuable suggestion for predicting protein structures with novel folds. Here we clarified the frequency with which protein folds share the same SSE packing arrangement with other folds, <b>the</b> types of <b>spatial</b> arrangement of SSEs that are frequently observed across different folds, and the diversity of protein folds that share <b>the</b> same <b>spatial</b> arrangement of SSEs with a given fold, using a protein structure alignment program MICAN, which we have been developing.

We also observed that many protein pairs that share <b>the</b> same <b>spatial</b> arrangement of SSEs belong to the different classes, often with an opposing N- to C-terminal direction of the polypeptide chain. The most frequently observed spatial arrangement of SSEs was the 2 -layer a/b packing arrangement and it was dispersed among as many as 27 % of SCOP fold representatives. These results suggest that <b>the</b> same <b>spatial</b> arrangements of SSEs are adopted by a wide variety of different folds and that th...|$|R
