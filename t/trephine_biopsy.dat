40|$|Introduction: Bone marrow {{aspiration}} (BMA) and <b>trephine</b> <b>biopsy</b> are indispensable diagnostic {{tools for}} evaluating hematological and nonhematological disorders {{in the present}} era. However, <b>trephine</b> <b>biopsy</b> demands greater technical skills and expertise as compared to BMA alone. In this study, we have analyzed the advantages of carrying out <b>trephine</b> <b>biopsy</b> along with BMA in the same sitting. Materials and Methods: This is a prospective observational study carried out from June 2014 to May 2015. The patients attending hematology and medicine outdoors were screened by detailed clinical examination, laboratory investigations including complete blood counts, peripheral smear, and whenever indicated were subjected to BMA and <b>trephine</b> <b>biopsy</b> in the same sitting. Results: Out of total 570 aspirations and trephine biopsies done, 8 % showed inadequate aspirates and diagnosis was based only on biopsy findings. Confirmatory diagnosis of aplastic anemia was done on <b>trephine</b> <b>biopsy</b> in 100 % cases. Fifty percent cases of granulomas and 33. 3 % cases of metastasis were missed in aspiration smears. They were diagnosed on <b>trephine</b> <b>biopsy.</b> All cases of myelofibrosis required <b>trephine</b> <b>biopsy</b> for diagnosis, but aspiration alone was adequate for diagnosis in majority of acute leukemias. Conclusion: <b>Trephine</b> <b>biopsy</b> is mandatory for diagnosis of aplastic anemia, myelofibrosis, and for staging of lymphomas.

40|$|AIMS: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} methyl methacrylate resin as an embedding medium for undecalcified bone marrow <b>trephine</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens. METHODS: About 2500 undecalcified bone marrow <b>trephine</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens were processed, and embedded in methyl methacrylate resin. Semithin sections (2 - 3 microns) were stained by routine tinctorial and immunocytochemical staining methods {{with a wide range}} of antibodies using a standard streptavidin biotin horseradish peroxidase technique. Different antigen retrieval pretreatments were evaluated. RESULTS: Bone marrow <b>trephine</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens are embedded routinely in methyl methacrylate at the Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service at The Leeds General Infirmary. Over 50 different primary antibodies are in current use; for the majority of these, microwave antigen retrieval or trypsin digestion, or both, is either essential or greatly enhances the results. CONCLUSIONS: Embedding bone marrow <b>trephine</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens in methyl methacrylate resin retains morphology and permits reliable, high quality immunocytochemistry.

DNA from 10 <b>trephine</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens was subjected to PCR amplification using HLA-DPB primers to determine whether the extracted nucleic acid was of sufficient quality to permit amplification. RESULTS: For most specimens the greatest yield of high molecular weight DNA was seen after five days' incubation.

PCR amplification using HLA-DPB primers yielded positive results in six out of 10 <b>trephine</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens.

40|$|Background: Bone marrow {{examination}} is {{an important}} diagnostic tool to evaluate various disorders which includes both neoplastic and non- neoplastic hematological diseases. Few studies have compared the relative value of aspirate with <b>trephine</b> <b>biopsy.</b> The present {{study was conducted to}} compare the role of bone marrow aspirate and <b>trephine</b> <b>biopsy</b> to formulate an effective and rapid method for diagnosing wide spectrum of hematological diseases. Materials and Methods: This is a three year retrospective study done from July 2010 to June 2013. A total of 95 cases presented with clinical haematological disorders; of which only 89 were biopsied and the correlation done. All the smears and sections were reviewed for morphological details and findings on aspirate and biopsy and compared to each other. Results: Out of the 89 cases selected for study; bone marrow aspiration revealed diagnostic materials in 75 cases and 14 cases were inconclusive for a definite diagnosis. The diagnostic accuracy of the bone marrow aspiration cytology was 84. 26 %. Eighty eight cases were diagnosed on <b>trephine</b> <b>biopsy</b> of bone marrow with diagnostic accuracy of 98. 87 %. Conclusion: Both the aspiration cytology and <b>trephine</b> <b>biopsy</b> complement each other for evaluating any haematological disorder. Though cellular morphology is better understood in marrow aspirates and is equally effective to biopsy in diagnosing various anemias and leukemias; however it is the histopathological study of <b>trephine</b> <b>biopsy</b> that gives well preserved marrow architecture with its all cellular and stromal components. modalities including radiological, microbiological and serological tests.

METHODS [...] Sixty five consecutive bone marrow <b>trephine</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens of more than 1 cm in length were divided transversely into two equal parts. One part was processed in paraffin wax followed by decalcification. The other part was embedded in the epoxyresin Polarbed 812 followed by the cutting of 1 micron sections. Both parts underwent immunohistochemical staining by an identical panel of antibodies. With Polarbed 812 plastic embedded sections, microwave heating in citrate buffer was undertaken before the application of antisera. RESULTS [...] On sections cut from plastic embedded material, immunohistochemical staining was generally satisfactory, easy to interpret and comparable with that achieved with paraffin wax embedded material. Exceptions were antibodies to neutrophil elastase and CD 61 where immunostaining was consistently negative on plastic embedded sections. Immunohistochemical staining for CD 20 was consistently more reliable on plastic embedded sections.

40|$|Background: Bone marrow {{examination}} {{is useful}} in the diagnosis of both hematological and non-hematological disorders. The two most important techniques used for the diagnosis of hematological disorders are bone marrow aspiration and <b>trephine</b> <b>biopsy</b> which are complementary to each other. The present study is to evaluate the findings of bone marrow aspiration and <b>trephine</b> <b>biopsy</b> and their cytological and histological patterns in various hematological disorders. The aim {{of the study is}} to evaluate the clinical profile, spectrum, cytological and histological pattern of various hematological disorders reported in bone marrow aspiration and <b>trephine</b> <b>biopsy</b> respectively. Methods: It was a cross-sectional study design with 105 patients who underwent bone marrow examination for evaluation of hematological disorders in the Department of pathology, Andhra Medical College during the period of 2012 to 2014. Results: Among 105 cases studied, age of patients ranged from 1 to 68 yrs with mean age of 32. 4 yrs and male predominance (1. 5 : 1). Most of the patients presented with fever, shortness of breath, Easy fatigability and generalized weakness. The commonest physical findings were pallor followed by splenomegaly and hepatomegaly and in hematological parameters predominantly pancytopenia. Bone marrow aspiration was diagnostic in 53 (50 %) cases and <b>trephine</b> <b>biopsy</b> was diagnostic in 52 (50 %) cases. Anemias (50 %) and leukemias (16 %) are most common hematological disorders. Among the anemias, megaloblastic anemia is the most common (40 %) cause of hematological non-malignancies. Among leukemias, acute myeloid leukemias are common cause of hematological malignancies.

40|$|Background. In {{the last}} few years many studies have been {{published}} on GM-CSF receptors, focusing on molecular structure, function and distribution. Nevertheless, protocols for detecting GM-CSF receptors on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded histological sections, to our knowledge, have not been described. Methods. A method based on non-isotopic in situ hybridization (ISH) using a 21 -base antisense DNA oligoprobe whose 3 ’-end was labeled with digoxigenin 11 -dUTP was devised. The probe was applied on 20 routinely processed bone marrow <b>trephine</b> <b>biopsies</b> which were considered as positive controls. Results. The hybridization signal was seen in myeloid cells, erythroid progenitors and rare megakaryocytes. Conclusions. Non-isotopic ISH represents an alternative to current methodologies for the assessment of GM-CSF receptor expression; since it is suitable for routinely processed samples, it can be regarded as a helpful tool for diagnostic determination of GM-CSF receptors in tumors from patients receiving GM-CSF and for retrospective studies on archival material...|$|R
