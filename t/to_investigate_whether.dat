5|$|Scottish Protestantism in {{the seventeenth}} century was highly focused on the Bible, which was seen as infallible and the major source of moral authority.

In 1611 the Kirk adopted the Authorised King James Version and the first Scots version was printed in Scotland in 1633, but the Geneva Bible continued to be employed into the late seventeenth century. Many Bibles were large, illustrated and highly valuable objects. They often became the subject of superstitions, being used in divination. Family worship was strongly encouraged by the Covenanters.

5|$|The loss of Kronan {{was a hard}} {{blow for}} Sweden during the Scanian War. Besides being {{the largest and most}} heavily armed ship in the Swedish Navy, she had been an {{important}} status symbol for the monarchy of the young Charles XI. Along with Kronan, the navy lost a sizeable proportion of its best manpower, acting supreme commander Lorentz Creutz, numerous high-ranking fleet officers, and the chief of the navy medical staff. A commission was set up <b>to</b> <b>investigate</b> <b>whether</b> any individuals could be held responsible for the Swedish fiasco at the Battle of Öland and other major defeats during the war. Although no one was officially held accountable, Creutz has been blamed by many historians for the sinking of Kronan because of his naval and command inexperience. Recent research has provided a more nuanced picture, and points to Sweden's general lack of a well-developed naval organization and officer corps at the time.|$|E

40|$|This paper makes {{a modest}} {{contribution}} <b>to</b> <b>investigating</b> <b>whether</b> people, when tackling dynamic decision problems, formulate plans and then implement them. Assumed behaviour {{of this form}} is central to many theories of economic decision-making, yet much direct empirical evidence (from economists and particularly from psychologists) suggests that it has rather dubious empirical support. The paper begins by discussing the importance and centrality of planning to economic theories of dynamic decision-making, and then examines the difficulty of empirically <b>investigating</b> <b>whether</b> planning occurs. It then describes a simple experiment that sheds some light on this phenomenon. The findings from the experiment, although only directly relevant to {{the context of the}} experiment, do suggest that people do (want to) plan when the circumstances are appropriate.

30|$|RQ 2 a) refers <b>to</b> <b>investigating</b> <b>whether</b> {{the central}} Rasch-modeling {{assumption}} of equal discrimination parameters is fulfilled for all items. For performing the Andersen-Likelihood-Ratio-Tests and Wald-Tests we determined a significance level of 20 %. For {{taking into account}} the alpha-error-cumulation, a Bonferroni correction (Abdi 2007) was conducted for the Wald-tests through dividing the defined significance level by the number of performed tests per dimension. The Andersen-Likelihood-Ratio-Test is not significant for the conceptual dimension (p = . 503  > . 2) but for the statistical dimension (p = . 003  < . 2). However, the results of the Wald-Tests show that no z value is significant. Consequently, our test allows a separated statement regarding task-difficulties and test persons’ abilities.|$|R
