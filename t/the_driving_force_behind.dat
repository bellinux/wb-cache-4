A body of controversial research under the umbrella ofimplicit egotism, starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, has investigated whether people unknowingly make life decisions based on their name letters or name. Sceptics say that to claim that a name or name letters influences life decisions is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence.|$|E

5|$|The Council of Trent (1545–1563) became <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> the Counter-Reformation in {{response}} to the Protestant movement. Doctrinally, it reaffirmed central Catholic teachings such as transubstantiation and the requirement for love and hope as well as faith to attain salvation. In subsequent centuries, Catholicism spread widely across the world despite experiencing a reduction in its hold on European populations due to the growth of religious scepticism during and after the Enlightenment.|$|E
5|$|The Towers, {{now known}} as the Shirley Institute, was once the home of {{engineer}} Daniel Adamson – <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> the Manchester Ship Canal project – and the venue where the decision to build the canal was taken.

5|$|The fortifications of Gibraltar were modernised and {{upgraded}} in the 1770s {{with the}} construction of new batteries, bastions and curtain walls. <b>The</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> this programme was the highly experienced Colonel (later Major General) William Green, who was to play a key role a few years later as chief engineer of Gibraltar. He was joined in 1776 by Lieutenant General George Augustus Elliott, a veteran of earlier wars against France and Spain who took over the governorship of Gibraltar at a key moment.|$|E
5|$|After leaving {{school at}} the age of 14, Mason got a job with the {{district}} bank while he attended night school in his spare time.

The business thrived: by the early 1850s the Mason family had built two state-of-the-art cotton mills in the Ryecroft area of Ashton-under-Lyne, known as the Oxford Mills. He was able to purchase Groby Hall, in Ashton, the ancestral seat of the former Lord Greys of Groby.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{of science}} {{differ in their}} views of the {{significance}} of the scientific accomplishments in the medieval Islamic world. The traditionalist view, exemplified by Bertrand Russell, holds that Islamic science, while admirable in many technical ways, lacked the intellectual energy required for innovation and was chiefly important for preserving ancient knowledge, and handing it on to medieval Europe. The revisionist view, exemplified by Abdus Salam, George Saliba and John M. Hobson holds that a Muslim scientific revolution occurred during the Middle Ages. Scholars such as Donald Routledge Hill and Ahmad Y Hassan argue that Islam was <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> these scientific achievements.|$|E
5|$|In March 1801, Frederick Accum {{was offered}} a {{position}} at the Royal Institution in Ablemarle Street, a research institute founded two years earlier by Count Rumford. Accepting the position, he began as laboratory assistant to Humphry Davy, who had been hired {{at the same time}} as director of the laboratory, and would later become the president of the Royal Society. Accum’s employment at the Royal came to an end in September 1803. His biographer, R. J. Cole, speculates this change was connected with the simultaneous departure of Count Rumford for employment in Paris. Rumford had been <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> securing a position for Accum.|$|E
5|$|Jocelin was a royal justiciar in 1203, {{as well as}} the {{custodian}} of {{the vacant}} diocese of Lincoln. He was a royal clerk as well as a canon of Wells, becoming a canon and a deacon by 1200. The previous bishop of Wells died in 1205, and on 3 February 1206, Jocelin was elected bishop. He was consecrated on 28 May 1206, at Reading by Bishop William of Sainte-Mère-Eglise of London.

5|$|Other {{problems}} also emerged. In 1689, Anne's supporters (including the Marlboroughs and the Duke of Somerset) {{demanded that}} she be granted a parliamentary annuity of £50,000, a sum that would end her dependence on William and Mary. Sarah was seen as <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> this bill, creating further ill-feeling towards her at court. William responded to the demand by offering the same sum from the Privy Purse, to keep Anne dependent on his generosity. However, Anne, through Sarah, refused, pointing out that a parliamentary grant would be more secure than charity from the Privy Purse. Eventually Anne received the grant from Parliament, and felt she owed this to Sarah's efforts.|$|E
5|$|The {{closely related}} field of letter-preference {{research}} {{dates back to}} the 1950s. In 1985, Belgian psychologist Nuttin reported the surprising finding that people tend to disproportionately prefer, unknowingly, the letters of their own name. The name-letter effect has been replicated in dozens of follow-up studies in different languages, cultures and alphabets, no matter whether participants selected their preferred letter from a random pair, or picked the top six of all letters in the alphabet, or rated each individual letter. Nuttin predicted that because <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> the name-letter effect is an unconscious preference for anything connected to the self, there should also be a birthday-number effect.|$|E
5|$|Tom died of {{pancreatic}} cancer in July 1995—three years before {{construction of the}} park began. During a Chinatown Chamber of Commerce meeting held in March 1998, the Riverside Park Advisory Council suggested renaming the park in honor of Ping Tom, <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> the its creation. The request was approved on August 3, 1998, and the park was renamed Ping Tom Memorial Park. The park was dedicated and officially opened by Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley during a ceremony on October 2, 1999. In 2005, the CADC {{and friends of the}} Tom family commissioned sculptor Liao Huilana to create a bronze bust of Ping Tom. The bust was dedicated and installed at the park on October 22, 2005.|$|E

5|$|According to Kohlberg, someone {{progressing}} to {{a higher}} stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five). On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to the next level. Realizing {{the limitations of the}} current stage of thinking is <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last. The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.|$|E
5|$|Aria of Sorrow {{takes place}} in the fictional {{universe}} of the Castlevania series. The series' premise is the conflict between the vampire hunters of the Belmont clan and the immortal vampire Dracula. Thirty-six years before the start of Aria of Sorrow, Dracula was defeated once and for all by the Belmont clan, and his powers sealed into a solar eclipse. Shortly after Dracula's death, a prophecy was made that Dracula's reincarnation would come to his castle in 2035 and inherit all of Dracula's powers. This prophecy acts as <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> the plot of Aria of Sorrow, and is the primary motivation of the supporting characters to be present. The game {{takes place in}} Dracula's castle, the most common setting for the series, with the castle divided into numerous areas that the player traverses {{over the course of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the project}} was closely tied to the other two games, and Sneak Kings {{development}} was directly led by Burger King. The game started as a tile-based puzzle game, but quickly became a Spy vs Spy-style caper until Burger King made design choices that removed conventional hazards and competition elements in favor of a stealth game with no human opponents. Sneak King did not win critical acclaim and its reviews often reflected its unusual design elements, but the project was a financial success and resulted in millions of units being sold. Collectively, the games ranked amongst the top 10 best selling games of 2006. Burger King's Russell Klein would attribute the three game project as being <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> the company's 40% quarterly sales increase.|$|E
