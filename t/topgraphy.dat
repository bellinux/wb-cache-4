In addition, students can avail themselves {{of the opportunity to}} obtain franco-german double degrees in <b>Topgraphy</b> (Karlsruhe), Civil Engineering (Dresden), Environmental Engineering and Mechanical Engineering (Offenburg).|$|E
50|$|Since one of {{the major}} {{characteristics}} of a surge is the transport of water, measurements of precipitable water and the dew point can also increase. The increased water vapor increases the amount of convective available potential energy (CAPE), which can result in topographically-forced convection. Gulf moisture is typically constrained to central and southern Arizona by the <b>topgraphy</b> of the Mogollon Rim. The moderate steering flow from the surge pushes the convection off the mountains which brings precipitation to the desert valleys.|$|E

40|$|A {{high-resolution}} numerical lattice is used {{to study}} a topographically trapped motion around islands and shallow banks of the western Barents Sea caused both by the semidiurnal and diurnal tidal waves. Observations and model computations {{in the vicinity of}} Bear Island show well-developed trapped motion with distinctive tidal oscillatory motion. Numerical investigations demonstrate that one source of the trapped motion is tidal current rectification over shallow <b>topgraphy.</b> Tidal motion supports residual currents of the order of 8 cm/s around Bear Island and shallow Spitsbergenbanken. The structures of enhanced tidal currents for the semidiurnal components are generated in the shallow areas due to topographic amplification. In the diurnal band of oscillations the maximum current is associated with the shelf wave occurrence. Residual currents due to diurnal tides occur at both the shallow areas and the shelf slope in regions of maximum topographic gradients. Surface manifestation of the diurnal current enhancement is the local maximum of tidal amplitude at the shelf break of the order of 5 to 10 cm. Tidal current enhancement and tidally generated residual currents in the Bear Island and Spitsbergenabanken regions cause an increased generation of ice leads, ridges and, trapped motion of the ice floes...|$|E
40|$|Coronae {{are large}} quasi-circular geologica {{features}} that are common on Venus. They {{appear to be the}} surface tectonic and volcanic expressions of mantle diapirs that have impinged {{on the underside of the}} venusian lithosphere. We have investigated the spatial distribution of 335 coronae and related features identified in Magellan radar data. It is more clustered than a Poisson distribution, with a statistical certainty of more than 99 %. It is dominated by a single large cluster centered near the equator at about 245 deg longitude. The features are preferentially found at elevation and geoid values close to the planetary mean, with a paucity at both the highest and lowest levels of <b>topgraphy</b> and geoid. Some coronae appear aligned in quasi-linear chains. We attribute the clustering of coronae and related features to preferential formation of these features above regions of broad-scale mantle upwelling, and suggest that a major mantle upwelling underlies the one large cluster. We suggest that coronae are rare at the lowest elevations because these may be regions of mantle downwelling. The shortage of coronae at the highest elevations may result both from obscuration by other intense tectonism there and from suppression there of their formation by an unusually thick crust. Corona chains may be produced by enhanced passive mantle uplift below failed or incipient rifts...|$|E
40|$|The {{climate of}} Saudi Arabia {{has not been}} studied in any detail and this thesis {{is an attempt to}} analyse the general climatic {{conditions}} of the country. Chapter I comments on the difficulties that are manifest in climatic studies of the area and also refers to work that has been carried out on some parts of the country. Specifically, the chapter is concerned with the needs for more detailed and comprehensive climatic research on Saudi Arabia. A number of geographical factors are considered, in chapter II, Ito affect the distribution of the climatic elements:-the latitude, the geographical location relative to the land masses, the position relative to the waterbodies and the altitude. Chapter III is {{a brief description of the}} <b>topgraphy</b> of the study area. Subdivision into topographic units of Saudi Arabia is made on the basis of variations in elevations and type of landscape. Air masses and fronts and the pressure systems that dominate the country in winter and summer, are discussed in some detail in chapter IV. Some references to the winter and summer depressions are also made in this chapter. In chapter V an attempt is made to describe the velocity and direction of winds. According to their directions, they are classified into three types - the north-west, the south-east monsoon and the south-west monsoon. Special consideration is placed on the phenomenon of sand and dust storms as a climatic factor affecting visibility. In chapters VI and VII air temperatures and precipitation have been considered in some detail but, unfortunately a full treatment is not possible due to lack of data. However, while inter-seasonal variations in temperature were found to be large, intra-seasonal conditions seem to be comparatively uniform. Most of rainfall, although low, occurs in the winter season. It is very variable from one year, to another and also varies in incidence spatially. The only area which receives relatively high constant precipitation is the high land of the south-west region of Saudi Arabia. The study concludes in chapter VIII by classifying Saudi Arabia into climatic regions on the basis of Koppen's system. While a major part of the country is classified as an extremely arid region, limited areas in the mountainous south-west exhibit considerable climatic variations...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: NASAâ€™s Dawn {{spacecraft}} entered {{orbit of}} the inner main belt asteroid 4 Vesta on July 16, 2011, and spent about one year in orbit to characterize the geology, elemental and mineralogical composition, topography, shape, and internal structure of Vesta before it departed to asteroid 1 Ceres in late 2012. One of the major goals of the mission was a global mapping of Vesta. Data: The DAWN mission has mapped Vesta from three different orbital heights during Survey orbit (2700 km altitude), HAMO (High Altitude Mapping Orbit, 700 km altitude), and LAMO (Low Altitude Mapping Orbit, 210 km altitude) [1]. The Dawn mis- sion {{is equipped with a}} framing camera (FC) [2] which was the prime instrument during the LAMO phase. DAWN orbited Vesta during LAMO in 21 cycles be- tween December 2011 and end of April 2012. The framing camera took about 10, 000 clear filter images with a resolution of about 20 m/pixel during these cycles. The images were taken with different viewing angles and different illumination conditions. We se- lected about 8, 000 images for the global coverage of Vesta. Data Processing: The first step of the processing chain is to ortho rectify the images to the proper scale and map projection type. This process requires detailed high-resolution information of the local topography of Vesta. The global <b>topgraphy</b> was calculated during the stereo processing of the HAMO images [3] and was used here. The shape model was used for the calcula- tion of the ray intersection points while the map pro- jection itself was done onto a sphere with a mean radi- us of 255 km. The next step was the mosaicking of all images to one global mosaic of Vesta, the so called basemap. Vesta map tiles: The Vesta atlas was produced in a scale of 1 : 200, 000 and consists of 30 tiles that con- forms to the quadrangle scheme proposed by Greeley and Batson [4] and is used e. g., for mapping Mars in a scale of 1 : 5, 000, 000. A map scale of 1 : 200, 000 guar- antees a mapping at the highest available DAWN reso- lution in LAMO and results in an acceptable printing scale for the hardcopy map of 10 pixel/mm. The indi- vidual tiles were separately mosaicked and reprojected. Nomenclature: The DAWN team proposed to the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to use the names of vestal virgins and famous Roman women as names for the craters and to use names of places and festivals associated with vestal virgins for other feature names. This proposal was accepted by the IAU and the team could propose 65 names for geological features to the IAU which were also approved [5]. These feature names were applied to the map tiles and are shown in Figure 1. The entire Vesta atlas consisting of 30 map tiles will become available to the public through the Dawn GIS web page [[URL] dawn_gis. dlr. de/atlas]. References: [1] Russell, C. T. and Raymond, C.
