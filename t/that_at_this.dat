5|$|Once Kennedy and Eddy {{had settled}} their {{financial}} affairs in May 1872, {{she was left}} with $6,000. Peel writes <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point she had already written 60 pages of Science and Health. She was renting rooms in Lynn at 9 Broad Street, when 8 Broad Street came on the market. In March 1875 she purchased it for $5,650, taking in students to pay the mortgage. It was in the attic room of this house that she completed Science and Health.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to remain}} in one place long enough to receive provisions, Black Hawk's group were in poor health {{and some of them}} starved to death on the road. Black Hawk stated in his account of the battle <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point in the war he had every {{intention}} of escaping with his people back across the Mississippi River, but on encountering the large U.S. force at Wisconsin Heights he was left with no choice but to fight. His intention was to allow the non-combatants in his band to escape across the Wisconsin River.|$|E
5|$|Adomnán in his Life of Saint Columba {{offers a}} longer account, which Abbot Ségéne {{had heard from}} Oswald himself. Oswald, he says, {{had a vision of}} Columba the night before the battle, in which he was toldBe strong and act manfully. Behold, I will be with thee. This coming night go out from your camp into battle, for the Lord has granted me <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time your foes shall be put to flight and Cadwallon your enemy shall be {{delivered}} into your hands and you shall return victorious after battle and reign happily. Oswald described his vision to his council and all agreed that they would be baptised and accept Christianity after the battle. In the battle that followed, the British were routed despite their superior numbers; Cadwallon himself was killed.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 18th century, the French {{government}} {{tried to}} impose a system of crossing Poitevin horses with lighter-weight Norman and Thoroughbred horses to create cavalry horses. Despite financial incentives, private breeders protested because they felt that the resulting crossbred horses created poor quality mules upon further breeding. The changes also affected the characteristics of the breed that had been developed for work in its marshy homeland, including large hooves and a calm manner. Some sources argue <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point the breed was employed for agricultural and logging uses. Others state that they were not pulling horses, and were instead used almost solely for the production of mules.|$|E
5|$|Busch {{made contact}} with the artist {{association}} Jung München (Young Munich), met several notable Munich artists, and wrote and provided cartoons for the Jung München newspaper. Kaspar Braun, who published the satirical newspapers Münchener Bilderbogen (Picture Sheets from Munich) and Fliegende Blätter (Flying Leaves), proposed a collaboration with Busch. This association provided Busch with sufficient funds to live. An existing self-caricature suggests <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time he had an intense relationship with a woman from Ammerland. His courtship with a seventeen-year-old merchant's daughter, Anna Richter, whom Busch met through his brother Gustav, ended in 1862. Busch's biographer, Diers, suggests that her father probably refused to entrust his daughter to an almost unknown artist without regular income.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{a decline}} in social {{mobility}} for those of less prominent clans, the local elites became far more integrated into a nationwide upper class social structure during the Eastern Han period, thus expanding the classification of who belonged to the upper class. The emerging gentry class—which became fully consolidated during the Eastern Han—consisted of unemployed scholars, teachers, students, and government officials. These men, although geographically separated and mired in local activities, started to view themselves as participants in wider national affairs of politics and scholarship. They recognized shared values of filial piety, deference, and emphasizing study in the Five Classics over holding public office. Emperors Yuan and Cheng were forced to abandon their resettlement schemes for officials and their families around the royal tombs settlement in 40 BCE and 15 BCE, respectively; unlike the days of Emperor Wu, historian Cho-Yun Hsu asserts <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point officials and scholars had so much influence in both local and national-level politics that to forcibly relocate them became unthinkable.|$|E

5|$|From 20 January 1943, the Partisans {{had been}} hard-pressed by the Axis Case White offensive. Throughout that offensive, Partisan Supreme Headquarters engaged the Germans in {{negotiations}} to gain time {{to cross the}} Neretva river. In late February or early March 1943, the Partisans captured a German officer and about 25 soldiers, who joined about 100 Croatian Home Guards, and 15 Italian officers and 600 soldiers already being held as prisoners of war by the Partisans. Due to their desperate situation {{at this stage of}} Case White, and their need to delay the Axis in order to cross the Neretva river before the Germans struck, they decided to use the recently captured German officer to initiate negotiations. The German historians Ladislaus Hory and Martin Broszat concluded <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> critical period, Tito was also concerned {{that by the end of}} the war the attrition to his Partisan forces would be such that Mihailović's Chetniks would be more powerful. They suggest that Tito may have been willing to agree to a truce with the Germans in order to destroy the Chetniks.|$|E
5|$|Returning to education, Mao {{enrolled}} {{and dropped}} out of a police academy, a soap-production school, a law school and an economics school. His father only approved of the latter, but the lectures were in English, which Mao didn't understand, and so Mao abandoned it for the government-run Changsha Middle School; he soon {{dropped out of}} this too, finding it rooted in Confucianism. Undertaking his studies independently, he spent {{much time in the}} Changsha public library, reading core works of classical liberalism such as Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations and Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws, as well as the works of western scientists and philosophers such as Charles Darwin, J.S. Mill, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Herbert Spencer. Viewing himself as an intellectual, years later he admitted <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time he thought himself better than working people. Inspired by the work of Friedrich Paulsen, the liberal emphasis on individualism led Mao to believe that strong individuals were not bound by moral codes but should strive for the greater good; that the end justifies the means. Seeing no use in his son's intellectual pursuits, Mao's father cut off his allowance, forcing Mao to move into a hostel for the destitute.|$|E
5|$|Skara Brae, Maeshowe, the Ring of Brodgar and the Stones of Stenness {{together}} {{form the}} Heart of Neolithic Orkney UNESCO World Heritage Site {{in the western}} part of the Orkney Mainland and which was inscribed in 1999. This small area has provided a rich archaeological heritage in a location that is relatively remote from both the main centres of population in Scotland and from more densely populated parts of Europe. However, it would be a mistake to imagine that because Orkney is so placed today that this was always so. There is a substantial amount of evidence that suggests that a variety of the smaller islands in the British Isles developed an advanced society in the Neolithic that took several centuries longer to develop on the mainland of Great Britain. It is also clear that whilst the flow of ideas and technologies in Britain has often been from the south to the north, <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time, it is evident that Orkney played a significant role in the development of British Neolithic culture.|$|E

5|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{demands of}} the Punic Wars, {{in addition to a}} shortage of manpower, exposed the tactical weaknesses of the manipular legion, {{at least in the short}} term. In 217BC, Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners when slaves were pressed into naval service; around 213BC, the property requirement was reduced from 11,000 to 4,000 asses. Since the Romans are unlikely to have preferred to employ slaves over poor citizens in their armies, it must be assumed <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point, the proletarii of the poorest citizens must also have been pressed into service despite their lack of legal qualification. By 123BC, the financial requirement for military service was slashed again from 4,000 asses to just 1,500 asses. By this time, therefore, it is clear that many of the property-less former proletarii had been nominally admitted into the adsidui.|$|E
5|$|The trial resumed on March 4, 2013 with testimonies from expert {{witnesses}} {{in the fields of}} criminal psychology (Tereza Soukupová, appointed by the court) and psychiatry (Alena Gayová, appointed by the defense). Blythe returned to attend the hearings in person, even though the presiding judge had told him <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point they may be undertaken in his absence. The two {{expert witnesses}} agreed that Blythe is not aggressive; nevertheless, he may have issues with controlling his emotions under stress. The court further heard testimonies from two eyewitnesses. One of them was a bodyguard who was present at the concert but did not see the fall. He testified that when by the exit, he saw two men taking a third man out of the building to fresh air. He said that he was told by them that the person fell off the stage. The ambulance arrived 5–10 minutes later.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Byrne's early life beyond {{the fact that he}} was born in Ireland in 1806. His first fight, in 1825, was a loss to Mike Larking; it lasted 138 rounds spread over two and a half hours—despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time a round could vary in length, and usually only ended when a man was knocked down. His second fight was a draw against Jack Manning in 1826, earning Byrne £100. Next was Byrne's first match against the Scottish boxer Alexander McKay, which Byrne won easily in five rounds, earning him a further £100. This match was McKay's first ever prize-fight. This victory was soon {{followed}} by a win against Bob Avery, earning a further £50, then another win over Phil Samson in 1829, earning him £200. By the standards of the day these latter sums were enormous; it is therefore surprising that he was then offered £200 for a rematch, regardless of whether he won or not, against the less experienced McKay, whom he had beaten so easily on the first occasion. As of 2008 that would be the equivalent of about £13,600.|$|E

5|$|While the golden-crowned sifaka faces few {{biological}} threats, such as predation, {{it faces}} many significant human-caused (anthropogenic) threats. Its habitat has been highly fragmented, with forest patches isolated by severely degraded grasslands. By 1985 {{it was estimated}} that 34% of the entire eastern rainforest of the island had disappeared, and by extrapolation it is predicted <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> rate of deforestation there will be no eastern rainforest left by 2020. Illegal logging practices, slash-and-burn agriculture (known as tavy), uncontrolled grass fires, gold mining, poaching, and clearing land for agricultural use have all significantly contributed to the significant deforestation witnessed in Madagascar and the ongoing decline of suitable habitat for this species.|$|E
