5|$|Additionally, Congress {{required}} jurisdictions seeking bailout <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>evidence</b> {{of minority}} registration and voting rates, including how these rates {{have changed over}} time and {{in comparison to the}} registration and voting rates of the majority. If the court determines that the covered jurisdiction is eligible for bailout, it will enter a declaratory judgment in the jurisdiction's favor. The court will retain jurisdiction for the following 10 years and may order the jurisdiction back into coverage if the jurisdiction subsequently engages in voting discrimination.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to combine the results of several small studies <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>evidence</b> that is stronger than that available from each study alone—a statistical method known as meta-analysis. One of four such analyses, conducted in 2006, looked at 19 studies on a total of 1,084 patients. It concluded that half the patients achieved a 50% reduction in seizures and a third achieved a 90% reduction.|$|E
25|$|A {{process has}} been {{specified}} that provides a standardised route for those seeking <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>evidence</b> {{of the effectiveness of}} interventions. Originally developed to establish processes for the production of evidence in the housing sector, the standard is general in nature and is applicable across a variety of practice areas and potential outcomes of interest.|$|E

25|$|The {{indictment}} of Zörgiebel {{was rejected by}} the state prosecutors and Litten appealed. Zörgiebel turned around and filed charges against a worker who had slapped his ear. Litten then took on this worker's defense, arguing that the worker had acted out of justifiable anger about Zörgiebel's 33 murders. The justice rejected Litten's request <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>evidence</b> {{on the grounds that the}} 33-count murder indictment against Zörgiebel could be accepted as fact without dropping the culpability of the worker who had hit Zörgiebel on the ear.|$|E
25|$|Luca Giuliani, a {{professor}} of classical archaeology at Humboldt University, {{has argued that the}} Warren cup was likely to be a 20th-century fake, {{on the basis of the}} unique subject matter and several incoherences in the iconography. At a King's College seminar on 12 March 2014, where counter-arguments were put forward by Dyfri Williams, Giuliani conceded that, if the British Museum were <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>evidence</b> for traces of silver chloride corrosion on the inner side of the cup's shell, this would be a decisive argument for the authenticity of the piece.|$|E
25|$|They {{said the}} investors' victory rate was {{misleading}} {{as a measure}} of arbitration's effectiveness since they often merely reimbursed investors for their losses, most of which then went to pay legal bills, and did not include punitive damages such as a court might award that could deter future misconduct. Nor did investors arbitrating claims have access to the full range of procedures they would in court. They could not force the brokerage <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>evidence,</b> and they often charged that the brokerages falsified or improperly withheld documents. Arbitrators also did not have to provide a written explanation for their decisions.|$|E

25|$|Laramie County Sheriff Seth Sharpless led the posses, which {{separated}} into groups of fifty men each. In addition to this, a $1,000 reward {{was placed on}} Bogan, dead or alive. When the manhunt did not produce Bogan, Siringo, acting on information he had received from sources, went undercover {{and was able to}} gain the confidence of Hall and his cohorts. Bogan, however, was no longer riding with them, and had made his way toward Utah. Siringo was able <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>evidence</b> for indictments against Hall and several others for their having assisted Bogan, resulting in their arrests.|$|E
25|$|His {{condemnation}} of Italian, German and Portuguese participation at the funerals of Ion Moța and Vasile Marin (organized by the Iron Guard in January 1937) drew notice from the Swiss, French and Dutch press. The event also reconciled him with Carol, who took advice from Filipescu and the PNȚ's Ion Mihalache {{on how to}} handle the fascist crisis. He ran on the PNȚ list in the local election of April 1937, taking a seat in the Yellow Sector of Bucharest and becoming widely tipped as a potential deputy to the Mayor of Bucharest. The period saw Epocas targeted attacks on Guard sympathizer Mihail Manoilescu. During the resulting trial for libel, Filipescu was able <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>evidence</b> that Manoilescu, despite being antisemitic, had not refused bribes from Jewish businesses.|$|E
25|$|Re Fong Thin Choo (1991), {{involved}} regulation 12(6) of the Customs Regulations 1979, which {{stated that}} the owner of goods or his agent could be required by a customs officer <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>evidence</b> that the goods had been exported or re-exported, and if the goods were not accounted for to the customs officer's satisfaction or {{were found to have}} been illegally re-landed in Singapore, the owner was liable to pay customs duty on them. The High Court held that the goods not having been exported was a precedent fact to the customs officer's power to require the owner to pay customs duty. Therefore, the Court had to decide whether the customs officer's decision was justified by the evidence, and not merely whether there was some evidence on which he could reasonably have reached his decision. However, the Court did not pursue the point since the applicant had not argued the case on this basis.|$|E
50|$|Part XI {{provided}} for increased penalties (imprisonment {{for up to}} seven years or transportation for life) for repeat offenders, {{and made it a}} felony for any court official <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> fraudulent <b>evidence</b> of previous convictions.|$|R
50|$|Different {{types of}} {{proceedings}} require parties to meet different burdens of proof, the typical examples being {{beyond a reasonable}} doubt, clear and convincing evidence, and preponderance of the evidence. Many jurisdictions have burden-shifting provisions, which require that if one party <b>produces</b> <b>evidence</b> tending <b>to</b> prove a certain point, the burden shifts to the other party <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> superior <b>evidence</b> tending <b>to</b> disprove it.|$|R

25|$|Most of {{the people}} accused by Bentley invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to answer her charges. A few, however, {{specifically}} denied them. Most notable of these was Harry Dexter White. White was suffering from heart disease, and {{he died of a}} heart attack a few days after his testimony before HUAC. Others who denied Bentley's charges were Lauchlin Currie, formerly President Roosevelt's economic affairs advisor, William Remington and William Henry Taylor, both midlevel government economists, Duncan Lee, formerly with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and Abe Brothman, a private sector chemist who worked on defense projects. In September 1948, William Remington sued Bentley and NBC for libel. In hopes of discrediting her, Remington's attorneys hired private detectives to look into her past. They were able <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>evidence</b> of her alcoholism, her periods of severe depression and a suicide attempt while a student in Florence, that her master's thesis had been written by someone else, and that, by the standards of her day, she had been sexually promiscuous since her college days. Bentley declined to testify at a Remington loyalty board hearing, and NBC settled the libel case out of court for $10,000.|$|E
500|$|The CIAR awarded both [...] "peer-reviewed" [...] {{projects}} after {{review by}} their Science Advisory Board, {{as well as}} [...] "special-reviewed" [...] projects awarded after review by tobacco company executives. The aim of the CIAR's peer-reviewed projects was mainly {{to divert attention from}} ETS as an indoor air pollutant, whereas special-reviewed projects were more likely <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>evidence</b> that the tobacco industry could later use to argue against anti-smoking legislation.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is arguably}} the case that, due to the immense {{distances}} between stars, any evidence we discover of extraterrestrial intelligence, whether it be an artifact or an electromagnetic signal, may come from a long-vanished civilization.

[...] Additionally, due to the extreme age of the universe, there may be a reasonable expectation for astrobiology research <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>evidence</b> of extinct alien life prior to the discovery of alien life itself.|$|E
2500|$|However, he also highlights: [...] "I’ve said it before: {{there are}} two sorts of atheists. One sort claims {{that there is no}} deity, the other claims that there is no {{evidence}} that proves the existence of a deity; I belong to the latter group, because if I were to claim that no god exists, I would have <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>evidence</b> to establish that claim, and I cannot. Religious persons have by far the easier position; they say they believe in a deity because that’s their preference, and they’ve read it in a book. That’s their right." ...|$|E

[...] At the same time, some of his followers left to set up their own educational centres accusing him of excessive authoritarianism. Some of Dolci's later initiatives were less successful than others, often bordering on the intangible. His centre sought <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>evidence</b> against a secret NATO submarine base around Maddalena island off Sardinia on the basis that such an installation required Italian approval and control which in this case was apparently granted covertly to the United States Navy.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 May 1989 the American Physical Society held {{a session}} on cold fusion in Baltimore, {{including}} many reports of experiments that failed <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>evidence</b> of cold fusion. At {{the end of}} the session, eight of the nine leading speakers stated that they considered the initial Fleischmann and Pons claim dead, with the ninth, Johann Rafelski, abstaining. Steven E. Koonin of Caltech called the Utah report a result of [...] "the incompetence and delusion of Pons and Fleischmann," [...] which was met with a standing ovation. Douglas R. O. Morrison, a physicist representing CERN, was the first to call the episode an example of pathological science.|$|E
2500|$|He held that, as in Tameside, the [...] "satisfaction" [...] {{referred}} to in regulation 12(6) {{is not a matter}} of pure judgment or opinion. It is also concerned with an inquiry as to a fact, namely, whether dutiable goods have been exported. Thus, the applicant had <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>evidence</b> to show that the goods had been exported and this evidence had to be to the satisfaction of the DG. Justice Chan affirmed that the test to ascertain if the DG's decision was valid was to determine if the DG could reasonably have come to his decision based on the evidence before him, or, in other words, whether the DG had decided based on a tenable factual basis.|$|E
2500|$|Armstrong and Team RadioShack {{maintained}} that Landis and his coach {{had asked for}} a spot on , and Landis only went public with the allegations after being denied a contract.

In an ESPN interview that day, Landis steadfastly denied that he had used synthetic testosterone during the 2006 Tour de France, but admitted to using human growth hormone and other doping modalities. The 2006 Tour de France was the only race <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>evidence</b> Landis had ever used banned substances.
