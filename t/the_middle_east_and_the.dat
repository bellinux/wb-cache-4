5|$|In 1973, {{before the}} {{founding}} of BuroHappold, Edmund Happold, Ian Liddell, Vera Straka, Peter Rice and Michael Dickson established a lightweight structures research laboratory corresponding to Frei Otto's similar research institute {{at the university of}} Stuttgart. Ted Happold was the first to introduce ethylenetetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) as a cladding material, and the outcomes of the research carried out by the laboratory {{led to the development of}} the designs for the Mannheim Multihall gridshell and a number of landmark fabric structures in <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> UK, allowing the new building forms to become generally accepted by architects and clients.|$|E
5|$|In January 1941, {{with the}} threat of {{invasion}} of England reduced, it was decided to send the 2nd AIF units there to <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> battalion arrived in Egypt in March 1941. Following this the battalion moved to Palestine where it undertook further training and received a draft of reinforcements which enabled it to raise a fourth company in order to bring it up to establishment. Having been transferred to the 7th Division, the battalion took up defensive positions around Mersa Matruh before taking part in the Syria-Lebanon campaign, during which it took part in several battles.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Singapore the Australian Government and many Australians feared that Japan would invade the Australian mainland. Australia was ill-prepared to counter such an attack as the RAAF lacked modern {{aircraft}} and the RAN was too small and unbalanced to counter the Imperial Japanese Navy. Additionally, the Army, although large, contained many inexperienced units and lacked mobility. In response to this threat most of the AIF was brought back from <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Government appealed to the United States for assistance. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill attempted to divert the 6th and 7th Divisions to Burma while they were en route to Australia, but Curtin refused to authorise this movement. As a compromise two brigades of the 6th Division disembarked at Ceylon and formed part of the island's garrison until they returned to Australia in August 1942.|$|E
5|$|Although the Song dynasty {{was able}} {{to hold back the}} Jin, a new foe came to power over the steppe, deserts, and plains north of the Jin dynasty. The Mongols, led by Genghis Khan (r. 1206–1227), {{initially}} invaded the Jin dynasty in 1205 and 1209, engaging in large raids across its borders, and in 1211 an enormous Mongol army was assembled to invade the Jin. The Jin dynasty was forced to submit and pay tribute to the Mongols as vassals; when the Jin suddenly moved their capital city from Beijing to Kaifeng, the Mongols saw this as a revolt. Under the leadership of Ögedei Khan (r.1229–1241), both the Jin dynasty and Western Xia dynasty were conquered by Mongol forces. The Mongols also invaded Korea, the Abbasid Caliphate of <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Kievan Rus'.|$|E
5|$|Arafat's long {{personal}} and political survival was taken by most Western commentators {{as a sign of}} his mastery of asymmetric warfare and his skill as a tactician, given the extremely dangerous nature of politics of <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> frequency of assassinations. Some commentators believe his survival was largely due to Israel's fear that he could become a martyr for the Palestinian cause if he were assassinated or even arrested by Israel. Others believe that Israel refrained from taking action against Arafat because it feared Arafat less than Hamas and the other Islamist movements gaining support over Fatah. The complex and fragile web of relations between the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab states contributed also to Arafat's longevity {{as the leader of the}} Palestinians.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, DiCaprio {{starred in}} Body of Lies, a spy film {{based on the}} novel of the same name by David Ignatius, set in context of <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> War on Terror, telling the story of three men battling a {{terrorist}} organization, and each other. Directed by Ridley Scott, DiCaprio dyed his hair brown and wore brown contacts for the role, which he chose to pursue because he considered it a throwback to political films of the 1970s such as The Parallax View (1974) and Three Days of the Condor (1975). The film received mixed reviews from critics, and at a budget of US$67.5 million, became a moderate box office success, grossing US$115 million worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In April 1942 Puttick was {{promoted}} to lieutenant general, the first New Zealand-born soldier to reach this rank. In the 1942 Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). As the war progressed he was faced with the difficulty of juggling resources to maintain both the 2nd New Zealand Division in <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 3rd New Zealand Division in the Pacific theatre. Later in the war, he was in favour keeping the 2nd Division in Italy {{to deal with what}} he considered to be the greater priority, the defeat of Germany, rather than have it be used against the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|In Genesis 24:22, Abraham's servant gave Rebecca a nose ring.

Many Native American and Alaskan tribes practiced septum piercing. It was popular among the Aztecs, the Mayans and the tribes of New Guinea, who adorned their pierced noses with bones and feathers to symbolize wealth and (among men) virility. The name of the Nez Perce tribe {{was derived from the}} practice, though nose piercing was not common within the tribe. The Aztecs, Mayans and Incas wore gold septum rings for adornment, with the practice continued to this day by the Kuna of Panama. Nose piercing also remains popular in Pakistan and Bangladesh and is practiced in a number of Middle Eastern and Arab countries.|$|E

5|$|Istanbul's {{strategic}} {{position on the}} historic Silk Road, rail networks to Europe and <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> only sea route between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean have produced a cosmopolitan populace, although less so since {{the establishment of the}} Turkish Republic in 1923. Overlooked for the new capital Ankara during the interwar period, the city has since regained much of its prominence. The population of the city has increased tenfold since the 1950s, as migrants from across Anatolia have moved in and city limits have expanded to accommodate them. Arts, music, film, and cultural festivals were established {{at the end of the}} 20th century and continue to be hosted by the city today.

5|$|It was {{not until}} 1840, that the Salukis were first brought to England. Referred to as Slughis, they and the modern Sloughi were treated as the same breed; however, recent genetic tests {{have shown that the}} two breeds are genetically separate. The first {{successful}} modern breeding line of Salukis began in 1895, with Florence Amherst (daughter of the 1st Baron Amherst of Hackney). Having seen Salukis on a Nile tour in that year, she imported a breeding pair from the Al Salihah area of Lower Egypt. A champion of breed purity, she struggled alone for nearly three decades, and real Saluki popularity did not take hold until the early 1920s, when officers returning from the war in <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Arab Revolt brought their pet Salukis home with them.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 1940, Sturdee {{accepted}} a demotion to major general {{in order to}} become the commander of Second AIF's newly raised 8th Division, receiving the Second AIF serial number NX35000.

Sturdee was restored to his rank of lieutenant general and appointed Chief of the General Staff.

5|$|No. 36 Squadron was {{particularly}} active during 2011. In January that year the squadron had to evacuate two C-17s from Amberley to Richmond when the base was threatened by rising floodwaters during the Queensland floods; {{of the other}} two Globemasters, one was in <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other was undergoing maintenance and could not be flown. The aircraft stranded at Amberley was moved onto high ground during the crisis at the base and escaped without damage. The two Richmond-based C-17s subsequently flew over 227 tonnes of supplies to flood-affected regions of Queensland. When flooding also took place in Victoria during January, No. 36 Squadron transported 100,000 sandbags to Melbourne and flew Royal Australian Navy personnel and vehicles into the state from HMAS Albatross in New South Wales. No. 36 Squadron returned to Amberley after the flood waters dropped in mid-February. In early February the north Queensland city of Cairns was threatened by Cyclone Yasi, and the RAAF conducted two C-17 sorties and two C-130 sorties to evacuate patients from Cairns Base Hospital on the night of 1/2 February. After the cyclone passed over the Queensland coast, C-17s flew 200 tonnes of groceries into Cairns over a two-day period as part of Operation Yasi Assist. No. 36 Squadron also contributed aircraft to the Australian response to the 2011 Christchurch earthquake in late February, the C-17s flying urban search and rescue teams into the city from the 23rd of the month and evacuating Australian citizens on their return flights.|$|E
