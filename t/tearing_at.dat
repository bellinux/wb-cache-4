5|$|The low foot {{to lower}} leg ratio in Deinonychus is due partly to an unusually short {{metatarsus}} (upper foot bones). The ratio is actually larger in smaller individuals than in larger ones. Ostrom {{suggested that the}} short metatarsus {{may be related to}} the function of the sickle claw, and used the fact that it appears to get shorter as individuals aged as support for this. He interpreted all these features– the short second toe with enlarged claw, short metatarsus, etc.– as support for the use of the hind leg as an offensive weapon, where the sickle claw would strike downwards and backwards, and the leg pulled back and down at the same time, slashing and <b>tearing</b> <b>at</b> the prey. Ostrom suggested that the short metatarsus reduced overall stress on the leg bones during such an attack, and interpreted the unusual arrangement of muscle attachments in the Deinonychus leg as support for his idea that a different set of muscles was used in the predatory stroke than in walking or running. Therefore, Ostrom concluded that the legs of Deinonychus represented a balance between running adaptations needed for an agile predator, and stress-reducing features to compensate for its unique foot weapon.|$|E

25|$|Virginia Rappe {{suffered}} from chronic cystitis, {{a condition that}} liquor irritated dramatically. Her heavy drinking habits and the poor quality of the era's bootleg alcohol could leave her in severe physical distress. She developed a reputation for over-imbibing at parties, then drunkenly <b>tearing</b> <b>at</b> her clothes from the resulting physical pain. But {{by the time of}} the St. Francis Hotel party, her reproductive health was a greater concern. She had undergone several abortions in the space of a few years, the quality of care she received for such procedures was probably substandard, and she was preparing to undergo another (or, more likely, had recently done so) as a result of being impregnated by her boyfriend, director Henry Lehrman.|$|E

25|$|Next he {{was made}} to observe the punishments for lay and ecclesiastical {{officials}} who lusted for wealth and prestige, officials who did not heed others' prayers, who neglected those in need, those who were indulgent, guilty of concealing wealth, adultery, concubinage and sodomy. Wetti was most terrified to see emperor Charlemagne, bound and completely unharmed, except for an animal <b>tearing</b> <b>at</b> his genitals. His shock came from the idea that Charlemagne was a pious, good-natured Christian king, but the angel revealed that all Charlemagne's good deeds had been negated by the lust and debauchery which dominated his later life. Yet he would eventually be forgiven because of his actions on behalf of Christianity.|$|E
25|$|The storyline {{dispute between}} Último Guerrero and Rey Escorpión {{that led to}} that week's main event was very evident even before the match {{actually}} started. Guerrero entered the ring first, then attacked Rey Escorpión {{while he was still}} on the floor, before the bell rang. Guerrero dove out of the ring and knocked Escorpión down, not once but three times in a row, inflicting enough damage that Rey Escorpión was not able to get inside the ring before the referee counted to 20, giving Último Guerrero the first fall by count out. Once Escorpión recovered he was able to fight back in the second round, he fought back against Guerrero, even {{going so far as to}} <b>tearing</b> <b>at</b> Guerrero's mask using his teeth. Escorpión gained a measure of revenge on Guerrero when he applied Último Guerrero's own Pulpo Guerrero ("The Guerrero Octopus") to Guerrero and forced him to submit, tying the match at one fall each. During the third fall Rey Escorpión team mate Dragón Rojo, Jr. came to ringside to distract the referee.|$|E
25|$|On November 28, Arbuckle testified as the defense's final witness. Arbuckle was simple, direct, and unflustered in both {{direct and}} cross examination. In his testimony, Arbuckle claimed that Rappe (whom he {{testified that he}} had known {{for five or six}} years) came into the party room (1220) around noon that day, and that some time {{afterward}} Mae Taub (daughter-in-law of Billy Sunday) asked him for a ride into town, so he went to his room (1219) to change his clothes and discovered Rappe in the bathroom vomiting in the toilet. Arbuckle then claimed Rappe told him she felt ill and asked to lie down, and that he carried her into the bedroom and asked a few of the party guests to help treat her. When Arbuckle {{and a few of the}} guests re-entered the room, they found Rappe on the floor near the bed <b>tearing</b> <b>at</b> her clothing and going into violent convulsions. To calm Rappe down, they placed her in a bathtub of cool water. Arbuckle and Fischbach then took her to room 1227 and called the hotel manager and doctor. After the doctor declared that Rappe was just drunk, Arbuckle then drove Taub to town.|$|E

25|$|The Main Event was a {{continuation}} of a storyline that had gotten very heated, very quickly as Volador Jr. and Mr. Niebla faced off in a singles match between the two. In previous weeks the two had fought, <b>tearing</b> <b>at</b> each other's masks and brutalizing each other whenever they got the chance; this match was no different. The action even included Mije and Zacarias, the Mascotas (little people in brightly colored costumes) as both Mije and Zacarias interfered in the match and tried to gain an advantage for their side. In the third and deciding fall Volador Jr. pulled Mr. Niebla's mask off, hoping to gain an advantage by the distraction, but Mr. Niebla had prepared for such a ploy and had his face wrapped in bandages under the mask so his bare face was not exposed. When the referee caught Volador Jr. with Mr. Niebla's mask in his hands he immediately called for the disqualification as {{it is illegal to}} take an opponent's mask off under Lucha Libre rules. For the third week in a row Volador Jr. challenged Mr. Niebla to a mask vs. mask match and for the third week in a row Mr. Niebla decline the challenge, stating Volador Jr. was not worthy of it.|$|E
25|$|While {{the main}} event saw two of CMLL's top Rudo factions face off as La Peste Negra faced off against Los Invasores, the storyline {{centered}} more around the building rivalry between Mr. Niebla of La Peste Negra and Volador Jr. of Los Invasores. At the previous week's Super Viernes the two had teamed up, but due to infighting between the two their team lost the match. Mr. Niebla allied himself with El Felino and Negro Casas while Volador Jr. teamed up with Mr. Águila and Psicosis, pitting two experienced teams against each other. La Peste Negra took the first fall, while Los Invasores cheated their way to taking the second fall. During the third fall Mr. Niebla began tearing Volador Jr.'s super hero inspired outfit apart, almost stripping Volador Jr. of his shirt as well as <b>tearing</b> <b>at</b> Volador Jr.'s mask. After {{a long period of}} the advantage switching {{back and forth between the}} two teams La Peste Negra distracted the referee, allowing Mr. Niebla to use an illegal low blow on Volador Jr. and pin him for the third and final fall. After the match an enraged Volador Jr. openly challenged Mr. Niebla to aLucha de Apuestas match where both wrestlers would risk their Masks. Like the previous week Mr. Niebla declined the challenge at that point in time.|$|E
500|$|The common {{method of}} {{grinding}} and mashing ingredients into pastes {{and the many}} potages and sauces {{has been used as}} an argument that most adults within the medieval nobility lost their teeth at an early age, and hence were forced to eat nothing but porridge, soup and ground-up meat.

On the tour, she was left behind in New York when Lennon and the other Beatles were quickly ushered into a car, and in Miami she had to ask the help of fans to convince a security guard who she was. Lennon's response was, [...] "Don't be so bloody slow next time—they could have killed you". It would be the only time Cynthia would go on tour with them.

American girls would write her letters proclaiming their desperate love for John; the women {{in the lives of the}} other Beatles received equivalent missives.

500|$|Within {{the context}} of rising ethnic {{nationalism}} during the 19th century in the territories of the multi-ethnic Austrian Empire, the [...] "German National Movement" [...] (...) sought {{the creation of a}} Greater Germany, along with the implementation of anti-semitic and anti-clerical policies, in an attempt to entrench the German ethnic identity. Starting with the revolutions of 1848, many ethnic groups under imperial rule, including the Serbs, [...] Czechs, Italians, Croats, Slovenes, and Poles, amongst others, demanded political, economic, and cultural equality. Traditionally, the German-speaking population of the Empire enjoyed societal privileges dating back to the reign of Empress Maria Theresa, and that of her son, Joseph II. German was considered the lingua franca of the Empire, and Empire's elite consisted primarily of German-speakers. The struggle between the many ethnic groups of the Empire and German-speakers defined the social and political landscape of the Empire from the 1870s, after the Compromise of 1867, which granted renewed sovereignty to the Kingdom of Hungary, until the dissolution of the Empire after the First World War. After the Austrian defeat in the Battle of Königgrätz of 1866, and the unification of what was then known as [...] "Lesser Germany" [...] under Prussian stewardship in 1871, the German Austrians in the Austro-Hungarian Empire felt that they had wrongly been excluded from the German nation-state, whilst other ethnicities within the Empire were <b>tearing</b> <b>at</b> its fabric. Conflict between Germans and Czechs grew particularly tense in 1879, when minister-president Viscount Taaffe did not include the German-Liberal Party (...) in the government of Cisleithania. This party was considered the main representative of the German-speaking middle class, and as such, the German National Movement went on to accuse the Party of not fighting for the rights of German-speakers within the Empire. The [...] "German School League" [...] (...) was formed in 1880 to protect German-language schools in parts of the Empire where German speakers were a minority. It promoted the establishment of German-language schools in communities where public funding was used for non-German schools.|$|E
