2500|$|The {{development}} of the cavity magnetron in the UK made possible the production of electromagnetic waves of a small enough wavelength (microwaves). American engineer Percy Spencer is generally credited with inventing the modern microwave oven after World War II from radar technology developed during the war. Named the [...] "Radarange", it was first sold in 1946. Raytheon later licensed its patents for a home-use microwave oven that was first introduced by Tappan in 1955, but these units were still too large and expensive for general home use. <b>The</b> <b>countertop</b> microwave oven was first introduced in 1967 by the Amana Corporation, and their use has spread into commercial and residential kitchens around the world. [...] In addition to their use in cooking food, types of microwave ovens are used for heating in many industrial processes.|$|E
2500|$|In 1947, Raytheon {{built the}} [...] "Radarange", the first commercially {{available}} microwave oven. It was almost [...] tall, weighed [...] and cost about US$5,000 ($ in [...] dollars) each. It consumed 3 kilowatts, {{about three times}} as much as today's microwave ovens, and was water-cooled. The name was the winning entry in an employee contest. An early Radarange was installed (and remains) in the galley of the nuclear-powered passenger/cargo ship NS Savannah. An early commercial model introduced in 1954 consumed 1.6 kilowatts and sold for US$2,000 to US$3,000 ($ to $ in [...] dollars). Raytheon licensed its technology to the Tappan Stove company of Mansfield, Ohio in 1952. They tried to market a large 220 volt wall unit as a home microwave oven in 1955 for a price of US$1,295 ($ in [...] dollars), but it did not sell well. In 1965, Raytheon acquired Amana. In 1967, they introduced the first popular home model, <b>the</b> <b>countertop</b> Radarange, at a price of US$495 ($ in [...] dollars).|$|E

30|$|We {{were very}} careful in placing the baits {{as close as}} {{possible}} to the hole where the ants came out; otherwise, they could establish trails on the walls or across <b>the</b> <b>countertops,</b> which clearly had to be avoided, especially if patients were children.|$|R
2500|$|In 1988, Santa Claus {{had three}} tiny, poorly {{maintained}} A-frame buildings painted to represent peppermint candies. American writer Mark Winegardner described Santa Claus {{at that time}} as being on its last legs. Additionally, Winegardner noted in his 1988 book Elvis Presley Boulevard: From Sea to Shining Sea, Almost, that"Styrofoam silver bells, strands of burned-out Christmas lights and faded plastic likenesses of Old Saint Nick garnished this little village. A lopsided, artificial twenty-foot tree whistled in the wind beside a broken Coke machine and an empty ice freezer. Two of the three buildings were padlocked; through their windows, encrusted with layers of sand and decade-old aerosol snow, ... I saw dusty, overturned fiberglass statuettes of elves and reindeer. Alongside the SANTA CLAUS, ARIZONA/ESTABLISHED 1937 sign was another: FOR SALE BY OWNER/$52,500/INQUIRE AT GIFTSHOP. An arrow pointed the way.""The gift shop stocked no seasonal items. Its shelves were littered with flea-market [...] at antique-shop prices. Battered paperbacks cost a buck. What little money the place generated must {{have come from the}} short-ordered grill and the soft-drinks cooler. On a stool behind <b>the</b> <b>countertop</b> cash register, a haggard, fiftyish man looked up from his circle-the-word puzzle and asked if we needed anything." ...|$|E
2500|$|His lectures {{frequently}} {{lasted for}} three or four hours. [...] His longest known lecture defined the unit of time known as the [...] "Woodward", after which his other lectures were deemed to be so many [...] "milli-Woodwards" [...] long. In many of these, he eschewed the use of slides and drew structures by using multicolored chalk. Typically, to begin a lecture, Woodward would arrive and lay out two large white handkerchiefs on <b>the</b> <b>countertop.</b> Upon one would be four or five colors of chalk (new pieces), neatly sorted by color, in a long row. Upon the other handkerchief would be placed an equally impressive row of cigarettes. The previous cigarette would be used to light the next one. His Thursday seminars at Harvard often lasted well into the night. He had a fixation with blue, and many of his suits, his car, and even his parking space were coloured in blue. In one of his laboratories, his students hung a large black and white photograph of the master from the ceiling, complete with a large blue [...] "tie" [...] appended. There it hung for some years (early 1970s), until scorched in a minor laboratory fire. He detested exercise, could get along with only a few hours of sleep every night, was a heavy smoker, and enjoyed Scotch whisky and martinis.|$|E

40|$|Emanation of radon (222 Rn) from granite countertops was {{measured}} using continuous and integrating radon monitors, and in air collected from encapsulated pieces of <b>the</b> <b>countertops.</b> A majority of <b>the</b> <b>countertops</b> emitted a measurable amount of radon. Although the granites contained the precursors, no thoron (220 Rn) emanation was detected. Gamma-ray spectroscopy {{was used to determine}} amounts of radium (222 Rn precursor) and other radionuclides in the granites. There was a correlation (r 2 = 0. 50) between the measured radon emanation and the radium content of the granites. Based on gamma-ray spectroscopy results, radon-emanation losses from the granite samples averaged 26 % of the total radium concentrations. Although some granite countertops emitted substantial amounts of radon (range = < 0. 1 - 2. 3 pCi/L), the contribution to indoor radon concentrations was estimated to average 0. 6 pCi/L...|$|R

50|$|Cabinets {{usually have}} one or more doors on the front, which are mounted with door hardware, and {{occasionally}} a lock. Cabinets may {{have one or}} more doors, drawers, and/or shelves.

50|$|The {{process of}} {{creating}} <b>the</b> <b>countertops</b> is different than granite, {{in that it is}} an engineered product, consisting of a minimum of 93% quartz and 7% epoxy binder and dyes. An engineered product that requires no sealer has the advantage in that it requires no harsh chemicals to seal, nor does it emit harmful chemicals into the air, making it potentially more environmentally friendly.|$|R

In a similar fashion, with stainless steel, a sink may be welded into the countertop; the joint is then ground to create a finished, concealed appearance.|$|E

50|$|Bottom-mount or under-mount sinks are {{installed}} below <b>the</b> <b>countertop</b> surface. The edge of <b>the</b> <b>countertop</b> material is exposed {{at the hole}} created for the sink (and so must be a carefully finished edge rather than a rough cut). The sink is then clamped {{to the bottom of}} the material from below. Especially for bottom-mount sinks, silicone-based sealants are usually used to assure a waterproof joint between the sink and <b>the</b> <b>countertop</b> material. Advantages of an undermount sink include superior ergonomics and a contemporary look; disadvantages include extra cost in both the sink and the counter top. Also, no matter how carefully the cut out is made, the result is either a small ledge or overhang at the interface with the sink. This can create an environment for catching dirt and allowing germs to grow.|$|E

During some early episodes in season 1, the Cohens were doing some extensive remodeling; {{this was probably}} written in because the new set did not accurately recreate the original home in Malibu. <b>The</b> kitchen <b>countertop</b> changed from a dark grey granite to a light beige marble <b>countertop.</b> <b>The</b> sink in <b>the</b> island <b>countertop</b> switches to <b>the</b> other side and the backsplash tile changes.
