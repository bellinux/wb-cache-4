Modern wind turbines claim that they have a high efficiency in term of wind energy extraction. However, there are still having losses due to tip vortex causing to a reduction in performance.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} and field experimental {{program has been}} carried out to investigate the use of <b>tip</b> <b>devices</b> on horizontal axis wind turbine rotors. The objective was to improve performance by the reduction of tip losses. While power output can always be increased by a simple radial tip extension, such a modification also results in an increased gale load both because of the extra projected area and longer moment arm. <b>Tip</b> <b>devices</b> have the potential to increase power output without such a structural penalty. A vortex lattice computer model was used to optimize three basic tip configuration types for a 25 kW stall limited commercial wind turbine. The types were a change in tip planform, and a single-element and double-element nonplanar tip extension (winglets). A complete data acquisition system was developed which recorded three wind speed components, ambient pressure, temperature, and turbine output. The system operated unattended and could perform real-time processing of the data, displaying the measured power curve as data accumulated in either a bin sort mode or polynomial curve fit. Approximately 270 hr of perormance data were collected over a three-month period. The sampling interval was 2. 4 sec; thrus over 400, 000 raw data points were logged.

40|$|Winglets being a small {{structure}} {{play an important}} role in reducing the induced drag in aircraft. Many types of winglets have been designed and their significance in reducing the drag is published. One of the main objectives of this master thesis work is to study about the winglet design and about their contribution in reducing induced drag. A brief overview of wing <b>tip</b> <b>devices</b> and their performance from the manufacturers as well as from airliner’s point of view are discussed. Moreover, the role of winglet in reducing the drag of commercial civil jet aircraft is studied and the percentage of drag reduction is calculated by a conceptual approach. A 320 specifications are taken to perform induced drag reduction calculation with and without winglets. Indeed, the total drag count reduced with the help of winglets accounts for additional payload which will be an advantage for the aircraft operator. Reducing the process time in design is one of the important criteria for any field and hence automation with help of CAD tools is very significant in reducing time. This study also aims at developing an automated model for different types of winglets and wing <b>tip</b> <b>devices</b> with the help of CAD technology focused on reducing design time during the initial design process.  Knowledge based approach is used in this work and all the models are parameterized so each model could be varied with associated parameters.

The so gained optimal design for the vortex diffuser blades is realized on a small scale model, and wind tunnel tests are carried out to investigate drag reduction of the vortex diffuser for comparison with numerical results. Furthermore, the goal is to gain some experience and data for preparation of real flight testing on a UAV.

40|$|Numerical {{computational}} {{methods are}} {{getting more and more}} sophisticated every day, enabling more accurate aircraft load predictions. In the structural design of aircraft higher levels of flexibility can be tolerated to arrive at a substantial weight reduction. The result is that aircraft of the future can be bigger, have better performance and less mass. The performance of an aircraft can be even further enhanced by the use of winglets or other wing <b>tip</b> <b>devices.</b> A more flexible structure in combination with larger dimensions can lead to substantial structural deflections. Due to these larger deflections, the interaction between the aerodynamics and structural mechanics is of increasing importance. Due to their outboard position, the aerodynamic performance of wing <b>tip</b> <b>devices</b> is obviously significantly influenced by the deformation of the flexible wing. Off course, a safe and reliable operational life of the aircraft has to be guaranteed and proven with adequate design calculations. The goal of this thesis was to develop an algorithm to enable the identification of flexibility effects on the outer wing within a manoeuvre loads context based on the Maximum Likelihood Method. The main difference with approaches of existing publications is that the models considered here are based on distributed local data rather than on the net effect on aircraft performance. While this requires the size of the specific models to be much larger, the identified models allow a much more detailed physical interpretation of the observed performance benefits or penalties of winglets or wing <b>tip</b> <b>devices.</b> There are many references that address the topic of aerodynamic performance of wing <b>tip</b> <b>devices</b> and also of winglets in particular. These studies are all based on either wind tunnel measurements or pure aerodynamic (CFD) analysis, thus valid for rigid aircraft. These studies are very important in understanding the complicated flow condition at the wing tip in order to arrive quicker at even more efficient designs. However, flight test measurements have shown that flexibility of the airframe has {{to be taken into account}} when predicting the (aerodynamic) loads on the winglet. An algorithm was developed that is able to identify the parameters in a nonlinear coupled aero-elastic manoeuvre loads model. The algorithm is based on the Maximum Likelihood method which is capable of solving even rank-deficient problems. This identification procedure is applied for a loads relevant industrial case using real flight test data. The identification procedure is performed five times using these in-flight measurements with modifications in the aerodynamic modelling on the wings and winglets. One model was developed that describes the nonlinear rigid behavior and could be optimised in an identification for a best fit to the flight test measurements. It was found that especially the local alpha-gradients on the winglet are much larger in this model as predicted by the corresponding results derived from the original aerodynamic database. These identified gradients were compared with the gradients determined from the CFD-simulations and it was shown that they correspond very well. The success of the identification of a specific model strongly depends on the structure of the model and the assumed initial values. The model must be sophisticated enough to capture/describe the phenomena contained in the measurements, however simple/small enough to enable its identification with the available computational resources. The identification algorithm from this thesis was shown to be a very good means to quantify model improvements during model development. Secondly, it can obviously be used to identify the most optimal values for the free model parameters. Control and SimulationAerospace Engineerin...|$|R

50|$|Wingtip {{devices are}} {{intended}} to improve the efficiency of fixed-wing aircraft. There are several types of wing <b>tip</b> <b>devices,</b> and although they function in different manners, their intended effect is always to reduce the aircraft's drag by partial recovery of the tip vortex energy. Wingtip devices can also improve aircraft handling characteristics and enhance safety for following aircraft. Such devices increase the effective aspect ratio of a wing without materially increasing the wingspan. An extension of span would lower lift-induced drag, but would increase parasitic drag and would require boosting the strength and weight of the wing. At some point, there is no net benefit from further increased span. There may also be operational considerations that limit the allowable wingspan (e.g., available width at airport gates).|$|R
