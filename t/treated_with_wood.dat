40|$|Wood {{materials}} {{are often used}} for outdoor constructions. It is expected that with growing demand for natural and renewable materials their usage will even increase in the future. In {{order to protect the}} wooden outdoor constructions biocides (wood preservatives) are applied, and if they are released to the environment with run-off waters, this could be considered as a source of environmental pollution with highly toxic substances. Due to the high toxicity, some of the historic wooden preservatives are banned or heavily restricted e. g. creosote, pentachlorophenol. There are several possibilities to reduce the environmental pollution coming from outdoor wooden constructions, e. g., by using wood preservatives with less toxic chemicals as components where possible, by reducing contact with water, or by achieving stronger binding of the toxic substances to the wooden material. The precondition for all these actions is proper information about the presence and concentrations of toxic substances in the composition of wood preservatives. The aim of the present research was to detect the extent of releases of toxic substances from wood materials <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>wood</b> preservatives and to explore efficiency of paint in reduction of leaching of toxic substances. Leachates obtained from painted and unpainted wood materials treated with three different wood preservatives were tested by Daphnia magna ecotoxicity test (LVS EN ISO 6341 : 1996). All three of the researched wood preservatives were water based and targeted to protect wooden constructions in outdoor conditions. The information about the products applied was crosschecked and verified with various information sources including further testing. Ecotoxicity test results showed that all tested leachates of wood material <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>wood</b> preservative characterizes with high toxicity to D. magna. Treatment of the preserved wood with paint reduces toxicity of leachates justifying painting as efficient measure to reduce leaching of toxic substances.

Liquid permeability was tested using an emulsion of Neen oil and a control of distillated water. Air was used to test the gas phase permeability. For both Eucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus citriodora, the longitudinal permeability of gas was shown to be about twice as great as the liquid phase permeability. No radial permeability was observed for either wood. The permeability of air and water through the sapwood of Eucalyptus grandis was greater than that through the sapwood of Eucalyptus citriodora. The permeability of neen oil preservative through the sapwood of Eucalyptus grandis was also greater than through the sapwood of E. Citradora, but the difference was not statistically significant. Scanning Electron Microscopy images showed that the distribution and obstruction in the vessels could be correlated with observed permeability properties.

40|$|Received for {{publication}} November 30, 2001. The importance of combustion processes {{as a source}} of substances with estrogenic activity in the environment was investigated. Wood (nontreated and <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>wood</b> preservatives), barbecue charcoal, meat, and kitchen waste were combusted in a laboratory-scale incinerator. Flue gas emissions (particulates and gaseous pollutants) were trapped in polyurethane foam cartridges. The cartridges were subjected to Soxhlet extraction and part of the extracts redissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) for analyses of estrogenic activity by means of the yeast-based human estrogen receptor (hER) bioassay. A synthetic estrogen, 17 -{alpha}-ethinylestradiol (EE 2), was used as the reference estrogenic compound. Part of the extracts was analyzed for the 16 USEPA priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Estrogenic compounds in the flue gas (wood) were as high as 234 ± 25 ng m- 3 EE 2 equivalent compared with 27 to 81 ng m- 3 EE 2 equivalent in flue gas from combustion of barbecue charcoal. Concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in both flue gas streams were in the range of 21 000 ± 2000 and 240 ± 110 ng m- 3, respectively. In general, the concentrations of EE 2 equivalent in the flue gas samples were at least a factor of 1000 lower than total PAH concentration.

Continuous measurements concerned the concentrations of the components CO, C_nH_m, NO, CO_ 2, and O_ 2, whereas polychlorinated dioxines and furanes as well as particles and single hydrocarbons in various operational conditions were measured discontinuously. The mean concentrations out of several burnouts ranged from 1500 to 11800 mg/m" 3 as for CO emissions and from 30 to 2500 mg/m" 3 as for C_nH_m emissions in manually charged firings, whereas in automatically charged ones the CO emissions reached between 130 and 6450 mg/m" 3 and the C_nH_m emissions, between 2 and 360 mg/m" 3.

An experiment was conducted in steam-heated soil and included two seed treatments (with Wood 1 R and a control without the bacterium) and six plant-nematode combinations which were Meloidogyne incognita on cotton, corn, and soybean; M. arenaria on peanut; Heterodera glycines on soybean; and Paratrichodorus minor on corn. Wood 1 R had no effect on final numbers of M. arenaria, P. minor, or H. glycines; however, final numbers of M. incognita were lower when seeds were <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>Wood</b> 1 R than left untreated, and this reduction was consistent among host plants. Population densities of Wood 1 R were greater on the roots of corn than on the other crops, and the bacterium was most effective in suppressing M. incognita on corn, with an average reduction of 41 %. Despite high population densities of Wood 1 R on corn, the bacterium was not able to suppress numbers of P. minor. When comparing the suppression of M. incognita on corn in natural and steam-heated soil, egg production by the nematode was suppressed in natural compared to steamed soil, but the presence of Wood 1 R did not result in additional suppression of the nematodes in the natural soil.

Lastly, a table of GPS coordinates for the marinas in this study is presented {{at the end of this}} appendix (Table A- 1). Tahoe Keys Marina The Tahoe Keys Marina, located near the southern shore of Lake Tahoe, was built 35 years ago on the Truckee Marsh. The Truckee River flows into the lake through the remnant of the marsh. In the 1960 s the residential/resort lots (Tahoe Keys) and marina were dredged from the existing marsh, and two channels were built to give the keys and marina access to the lake. Tahoe Keys uses the west channel, and the marina uses the east channel. As a result of a lawsuit brought by the Washoe Indian Tribe, flow is maintained in the Truckee River throughout the year to promote fishing. The Tahoe Keys Marina has 230 slips, 100 percent of which were occupied in the summer of 2006. Because the Tahoe Keyes Marina is located on a freshwater, oligotrophic lake, antifouling paints and hull cleaning have not been used extensively.

40|$|Wood ash {{application}} (WAA) {{has been}} recommended mainly for two reasons; i) to avoid depletion of minerals {{in the soil}} due to whole tree harvest in the forestry and ii) to mitigate harmful effects of acidification of soil and surface waters. In conclusion, the effects on terrestrial ecosystems and, especially, tree growth, {{can be attributed to}} the properties of the ash, the dose applied and the specific site at which the ash is applied. The research conducted on the effects of WAA on limnological ecosystems is very limited, and the major purpose of the present thesis was to gain knowledge of the effects of wood ash to different freshwater organisms, and the more comprehensive, limnological effects of WAA in the first stream in Bispgården, Sweden. Effects of wood ash solutions on the unicellular alga Euglena gracilis Klebs, the amphipod Gammarus pulex L., and the moss Fontinalis antipyretica Hedw. were investigated under laboratory conditions. Common in all three species was the decline in performance (growth/velocity/respiration/oxygen evolution) when the concentration of wood ash exceeded 5 g/l and no adjustment of pH was done (alkaline solution). In contrast, different movement parameters (motility, upwards swimming and velocity) in E. gracilis (neutral conditions), and increased growth of F. antipyretica with increased concentrations of wood ash indicated that nutrients in the ash was bioavailable for these organisms. There was no evidence of toxic effects on the organisms from metals or other compounds as a result from exposure to wood ash solutions in the present studies. The field study was conducted in a forest area close to Bispgården, about 100 km NW from Sundsvall, Sweden. The catchment area (50 ha) of the stream Fanbergsbäcken was <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>wood</b> ash in September of 2004 (3, 000 kg/ha;selfhardened crush-ash). In general, both biological (diatoms) and chemical (pH, alkalinity, and aluminum (Al) measurements) indicators have shown no significant effect on acidification parameters from the addition of wood ash. There was, however, evidence of an increased pH during spring flood, accompanied with a decrease in the frequency of low pH values (< 5. 6) during spring flood. In addition to this, alkalinity was significantly higher in the period 2005 - 2006, compared to that of 2003. High concentrations of toxic forms of Al repeatedly occured in the stream Fanbergsbäcken, and the WAA did not affect the frequencies of high concentrations of toxic Al forms (< 50 μg/l). Both the moss F. antipyretica and the leaves from Alnus incana displayed increased potassium (K) concentrations, although other nutrients did not increase from WAA. In conclusion, no evidence of WAA being effective in restoring or improving the ecological status of freshwater environments has been established, either in the literature or in the present field study. On the other hand, there were no indications of harmful effects due to WAA, either. However, we still do not know the effects of wood ash on several organisms (predominantly invertebrates) inhabiting small ponds and other, temporary or permanent, freshwater ecosystems. In the context of WAA, these environments and organisms have not attended any attention in the research published to date, and future studies are strongly encouraged...|$|E

The updated i3 concept consists of a new interior colour and materials concept. The seat covers combine responsibly sourced wool and leather naturally tanned with an olive oil leaf-based agent. The almost symmetrical curving dash is inlaid <b>with</b> <b>treated</b> eucalyptus <b>wood</b> that, according to BMW, is sourced from sustainably managed European forests.|$|R
30|$|Results from {{leaching}} experiments <b>with</b> <b>treated</b> <b>wood</b> {{are likely}} to vary considerably due to the inhomogeneity of wood {{that has to be}} used as test specimens. This can only slightly be compensated by using combinations of several test specimens in a test assembly, but cannot be circumvented. In addition, differences in the test results are acceptable to a certain degree if the aim of the test is a general description of leaching processes. Test specimens of the same origin and storage time have to be used if minor differences between wood preservatives have to be detected.|$|R
