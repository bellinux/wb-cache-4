40|$|The Aquitanian coast (France) is {{representative}} of sandy coastal environments with long linear beaches boarding a large continental shelf and interrupted by the Gironde estuary and the Arca-chon inlet. It is a mixed-energy environment with meso-tidal and long swell influences. In order to monitor the hydro and morphodynamics of this environment, several techniques including optical and radar remote sensing are used. Firstly, SPOT optical images are used to analyse rhythmic sub-tidal and inter-tidal bar morphology and dynamics. The method {{is based on the}} semi-empirical inversion of shallow water reflectance in terms of bathymetry. The results obtained at medium spatial scale based on a set of about 20 images are summarised: the bar morphology, their time of response and preliminary analysis of physical forcing based on waverider recording. Secondly, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is used for different dynamic aspects mainly for inlets. The PYLA 2001 campaign allowed the deployment of the polarimetric RAMSES P-band SAR (with a frequency of 448 MHz), developed by ONERA. The oceanic part of <b>this</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>aimed</b> both to study the capability of observing ocean surface salinity variability in the Gironde estuary and to obtain the surface currents in the Arcachon inlet.

One of EPA's highest priorities is to support the reduction of diesel emissions from ships, trucks, locomotives, and other diesel engines. In 2005, Congress authorized funding for the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA), a grant program, administrated by the EPA, to selectively retrofit or replace the older diesel engines most likely to impact human health. Since 2008, the DERA program has achieved impressive out outcome of improving air quality. The EPA also works with state and local partners to decrease emissions from port operations and to improve the efficient transportation of goods through the region. Both the EPA and the Port of Los Angeles are partners of the San Pedro Bay Ports Clean Air Action Plan, a sweeping plan aimed at significantly reducing the health risks posed by air pollution from port-related ships, trains, trucks, terminal equipment and harbor craft. For environmental justice, air pollution in low-income LA communities has received more attention. In 2011, the “Clean up Green up” campaign was launched to designate four low-income LA communities- Pacoima, Boyle Heights and Wilmington. <b>This</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>aims</b> to push green industries through incentives, including help obtaining permits and tax and utility rebates.|$|R

While multimodal biometrics is a well investigated subject in the literature, there exists no benchmark results on which basis fusion algorithms can be compared. Working towards this goal, we designed two sets of experiments: quality-dependent and cost-sensitive evaluations. The quality-dependent evaluation aims at evaluating how well fusion algorithms can perform under changing quality of raw biometric images principally due to change of devices. The cost-sensitive evaluation, on the other hand, aims at how well a fusion algorithm can perform given restricted computation and in the presence of software and hardware failures, resulting in errors such as failure to acquire and failure to match. Since multiple capturing devices are available, a fusion algorithm should be able to handle this non-ideal but nevertheless realistic scenario. It is on this ground that this evaluation is proposed. In both evaluations, a fusion algorithm is supplied with scores from each biometric comparison subsystems as well as the quality measures of both the template and the quality measures. The evaluation campaign is very encouraging, receiving 15 fusion systems. To the best of our knowledge, the BioSecure DS 2 evaluation campaign is the firs...|$|R
