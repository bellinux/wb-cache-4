5|$|The first {{recorded}} Armenian to visit North America was Martin the Armenian from Iran. He was an Iranian Armenian <b>tobacco</b> <b>grower</b> who settled in Jamestown, Virginia in 1618. In 1653–54, two Armenians from Constantinople {{were invited to}} Virginia to raise silk worms. A few other Armenians are recorded as having come to the US in {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries, but most moved as individuals and did not establish communities. By the 1770s over 70 Armenians had settled in the colonies. The persecution of Christian minorities under the Ottoman Empire and American missionary activities resulted in a small wave of Armenian migration to the US in the 1830s from Cilicia and Western Armenia. Hatchik (Christopher) Oscanyan, a Constantinople American missionary school student, arrived in America in 1835 to pursue higher education. He later worked for the New York Herald Tribune and became the New York Press Club president. Many Armenians followed him and went to the US for education.|$|E

50|$|Most of Malawi's {{tobacco is}} sold through global leaf {{processing}} companies Universal Leaf Corporation and Alliance One International. The primary buyers of Malawian tobacco are Philip Morris International and British American <b>Tobacco.</b> <b>Tobacco</b> <b>growers</b> in Malawi have three options {{to sell their}} product. <b>Tobacco</b> <b>growers</b> can sell their product on auction floors through tobacco clubs.

Permanent residents above the age of 18 in the two villages are investigated. Due to the dispersibility and randomness of samples, questionnaires are sent out randomly considering the differences in age, sex, education level, economic income and planting area. Excel is used to conduct statistics and analysis of survey data. Result shows that specialized curing has significant higher incentive effect on economic income of <b>tobacco</b> <b>growers</b> than the non-specialized curing. <b>Tobacco</b> <b>growers</b> in specialized curing area have apparently different attentive focus of future development, compared with the growers in non-specialized curing area. Specialized curing area focuses more on the improvement of technology, management and supporting industries; while growers in non-specialized curing area think that working outside is main way to improve the current situation. However, there are certain problems in specialized curing needed to be improved, such as operation mechanism, internal management, extension and application. Finally, it is pointed out that we should correctly handle {{the relationship between the}} income increase from specialized curing and the economic development, subject clarification and support enhancement, so as to ensure the sustainable development of specialized curing and to improve the economic income of <b>tobacco</b> <b>growers</b> effectively.

40|$|The “Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act” {{was signed}} into law on June 22, 2009.

Recent research conducted by the World Bank has shown that, contrary to tobacco industry claims, global tobacco control efforts are not a threat to developing countries or tobacco farmers.
