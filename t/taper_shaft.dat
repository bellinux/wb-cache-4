40|$|As várzeas estuarinas são ecossistemas ripários que estão associados a rios de águas brancas, com grande aporte de água doce e sedimentos decorrentes do ciclo diário de enchentes e vazantes representados pelas marés. Nestes ecossistemas ainda são poucos os planos de manejo aprovados, principalmente em virtude da falta de regularização fundiária das áreas. Além disso, existe a necessidade de estudos e métodos que viabilizem o manejo adequado desse ecossistema de modo a promover seu sustento e uso racional dos recursos. Geralmente as estimativas de altura, volume e afilamento do fuste das árvores são obtidas por meio de regressão linear e não linear. Como alternativa, a inteligência {{artificial}} é uma ferramenta promissora que vem sendo utilizada com êxito no segmento florestal, auxiliando na tomada de decisão. Este estudo teve o objetivo de ajustar, por meio de análise de regressão e redes neurais artificiais, equações hipsométricas, volumétricas e de afilamento para Calycophyllum spruceanum, espécie abundante em florestas secundárias no estuário amazônico. Foram cubadas 695 árvores da espécie em quatro povoamentos com idades de 60, 72 e 120 meses, nos municípios de Gurupá-Pará e Mazagão-Amapá. Por meio de regressão foram ajustados modelos hipsométricos, volumétricos e de afilamento considerando todos os dados e estratificados por idade do povoamento, posteriormente foram aplicados testes de identidade de modelos para verificar a possibilidade de redução do número de equações para volume, altura e afilamento. Foram treinadas 100 redes neurais artificiais para estimativas de altura, volume e afilamento do fuste utilizando o algoritmo Resilient Propagation e oito neurônios na camada intermediária. Para altura total, os três modelos testados por regressão (Exponencial, Gompertz e Logística) resultaram em boas estimativas. O modelo não-linear de Schumacher e Hall gerou estimativas de volume sem tendenciosidade. O modelo de Garay foi o que apresentou melhor precisão para estimar afilamento do fuste da espécie. Embora não se tenha verificado diferenças discrepantes na precisão dos modelos, considerando todos os dados em relação aos modelos estratificados por idade, o teste de identidade permitiu inferir que é mais adequado levar a idade em consideração nos ajustes. Com base nas medidas de precisão e dispersão de resíduos foi possível verificar que as estimativas geradas pelas redes são tão eficientes quanto as dos modelos de regressão. The estuarine wetlands are riparian ecosystems {{that are}} associated with white-water rivers, with large input of sediment from the daily cycle of flood and ebb of the tides. In these ecosystem are few approved management plans have been approved, mainly {{due to the lack of}} legalization ownership. In addition, there is a need for studies and methods of enabling the proper management of this ecosystem in order to promote their livelihoods and rational use of resources. In general, height, volume and taper estimates are obtained by linear and non-linear regression. Alternatively, the artificial intelligence is a promising tool that has been used successfully in the forestry sector, assisting the decision-making. This study aimed to adjust, through regression analysis and artificial neural networks, hypsometric equations, volumetric and tapering to Calycophyllum spruceanum, an abundant tree species in secondary forests in the Amazon várzea estuary. We randomly selected 695 trees of the species in four stands with 60, 72 and 120 months ages located in the municipalities of Gurupá, Pará state and Mazagão, Amapá state. Hypsometric, volumetric and taper were adjusted considering all data and population stratified by age, and identity tests were then applied to verify the possibility of reducing the number of equations for the volume, height and taper. One-hundred artificial neural networks were trained for height, volume and taper using the Resilient Propagation algorithm with eight neurons for the hidden layer. For the total height, the three models tested by regression (Exponential, Gompertz and Logistic) resulted in high precision estimates. The nonlinear model of Schumacher and Hall generated without bias precise volume estimates. The Garay model showed the best precision to estimate the species <b>taper</b> <b>shaft.</b> Although we did not find any differences in the precision of the models, considering all the data from the models stratified by age, identity testing also has shown that it is more appropriate to take into account the ages. Based on the precision parameters and residual distributions our results demonstrate that the estimates generated by the artificial neural networks are as efficient as the regression models...|$|E

50|$|The tapered key is tapered only on {{the side}} that engages the hub. The keyway in the hub has a taper that matches that of the tapered key. Some taper keys have a gib, or tab, for easier removal during disassembly. The purpose of the taper is to secure the key itself, as well as, to firmly engage the shaft to the hub {{without the need for}} a set screw. The problem with taper keys is that they can cause the center of the shaft {{rotation}} to be slightly off of the mating part. It is different from a <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft</b> lock in that tapered keys have a matching taper on the keyway, while <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft</b> locks do not.|$|R

40|$|Present work {{deals with}} the study of {{stresses}} developed in tapered functionally graded (FG) shaft system under both thermal and mechanical environment for three nodded beam element by using Timoshenko beam theory. The temperature distribution in radial direction is assumed based on one dimensional steady state temperature field by Fourier heat conduction equation without considering heat generation. Temperature dependent material properties are varied along the radial direction using power law gradation. <b>Tapered</b> FG <b>shaft</b> consists of rigid disk attached at its centre and shaft is mounted on two flexible bearings acts as spring and damper, inner radius of the <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft</b> is varying in x direction keeping thickness of hollow <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft</b> is constant. For the present analysis the Mixture of Stainless steel (SUS 304) and Aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3) are considered as inner and outer surface material of the FG shaft. Three dimensional constitutive relations are derived based on first order shear deformation theory (FSDT) for Timoshenko beam element considering rotary inertia, strain and kinetic energy of shaft and gyroscopic effect. In present study, structural and hysteretic damping are incorporated. Hamilton’s principle is used to derive governing equation of motion for three nodded beam element for six degree of freedom per node. Complete MATLB code is generated and shows that temperature field and power law gradient index have important part on material properties. Comparative study is carried out for Stainless steel and FG <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft,</b> shows that stress developed in FG shaft is comparatively lower than Steel shaft. Various results are obtained for coupled and uncoupled environment. Transient stress are obtained for varying power law index value and speed as a parameter. Stress amplitude increases for increase in speed and power law index. Results achieved for FG shaft shows advantages over steel shaft...|$|R

AIM: The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the influence of a smooth flexible versus active <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft</b> design on canal preparation by NiTi rotary techniques. METHODOLOGY: A XMCT-scanner (SkyScan 1072) and developed software (Bergmans et al. 2001) were used to nondestructively analyze the mesial canals of 10 extracted mandibular molars in 3 D with a spatial resolution of 30 microm. Specimens (n = 10 per group) were scanned before (PRE) and after (POST) preparation using Lightspeed (smooth flexible) or GT-rotary (active tapered) files. Numerical values for volumes, dentine removal (net) transportation and centring ability were obtained in addition to a visual inspection on canal aberrations. Data were analyzed by Shapiro Wilk test, multiway factorial anova, Tukey-Kramer test, Wilcoxon test and t-test. RESULTS: Results indicated that the active <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft</b> removed significantly more dentine in the middle to apical portion of the root compared to the smooth flexible design. Both groups demonstrated some straightening, but no significant differences were found with respect to instrument types. However, absolute values for net transportation and centering ratio were small and no canal aberrations could be found. CONCLUSIONS: The smooth flexible shaft design did not improve the morphological characteristics of canal preparation by NiTi rotary instruments when compared with the active tapered design. Therefore, system selection should be based upon other criteria. status: publishe...|$|R

AIM: To {{evaluate the}} influence of a progressive versus constant <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft</b> design on canal preparation by NiTi rotary techniques. METHODOLOGY: A XMCT-scanner and custom-made software were used to nondestructively analyse the mesial canals of 10 extracted mandibular molars in 3 D with a spatial resolution of 12. 5 microm. Specimens (n = 10 per group) were scanned before and after preparation using ProTaper (progressive tapered) or K 3 (constant tapered) files. Numerical values for volume, curvature, dentine removal and centring ratio were obtained in addition to a visual inspection for canal aberrations. Data were analysed by (multiway factorial) anova, Wilcoxon tests and t-tests. RESULTS: The volume of total dentine removal (mean +/- SD) was 1. 21 +/- 0. 66 mm(3) (ProTaper) and 1. 06 +/- 0. 23 mm(3) (K 3) (P > 0. 05), and the amount of dentine removal at all separate horizontal regions examined was comparable for both groups. The mean linear dentine removal (transportation) was in the range of 8 - 212 microm (ProTaper) and 4 - 187 microm (K 3). The resultant centring ratio varied from 0. 01 to 0. 24 (ProTaper) and from 0. 01 to 0. 17 (K 3), whilst different straightening patterns were observed. A centre displacement towards the furcation coronally was most pronounced for the ProTaper group whereas a centre displacement towards the outer side of the curvature more apically was only observed for the K 3 group. No severe canal aberrations were found. CONCLUSIONS: The progressive <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft</b> design of the ProTaper instrument was less influenced by the mid-root curvature than the constant tapered design of the K 3 instrument thereby providing a good centred apical preparation. However, ProTaper instruments tended to transport towards the furcation in the coronal region. status: publishe...|$|R
