On 26 January 1972, Craig announced plans to hold large rallies in major centres in Northern Ireland. The culmination was a large rally on 18 March 1972 in Belfast's Ormeau Park, attended by up to 60,000people, at which Craig said, [...] "We must build up the dossiers on {{the men and women who}} are a menace to <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> <b>because</b> one day, ladies and gentlemen, if the politicians fail, it will be our duty to liquidate the enemy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two {{days prior}} to the bombing, Bill Craig, former Minister of Home Affairs and founder {{and leader of the}} Unionist Vanguard movement, had held a rally at Belfast's Ormeau Park {{attended}} by 100,000 loyalists. There he had made the following speech that struck fear in many people from the Catholic community: [...] "We [...] must build up a dossier {{of the men and women}} who are a menace to <b>this</b> <b>country.</b> <b>Because</b> if and when the politicians fail us, it may be our job to liquidate the enemy". The next day, 30,000 Catholics paraded through Belfast to Ormeau Park where they held their own rally in protest at Craig's threatening speech. Republican Labour Party leader Paddy Kennedy promised that any Protestant backlash against Catholics [...] "would be met by a counter-backlash by the Irish people".|$|E

6000|$|The mode of {{government}} now adopted in Java is {{to retain the}} whole series of native rulers, from the village chief up to princes, who, {{under the name of}} Regents, are the heads of districts {{about the size of a}} small English county. With each Regent is placed a Dutch Resident, or Assistant Resident, who is considered to be his [...] "elder brother," [...] and whose [...] "orders" [...] take the form of [...] "recommendations," [...] which are, however, implicitly obeyed. Along with each Assistant Resident is a Controller, a kind of inspector of all the lower native rulers, who periodically visits every village in the district, examines the proceedings of the native courts, hears complaints against the head-men or other native chiefs, and superintends the Government plantations. This brings us to the [...] "culture system," [...] which is the source of all the wealth the Dutch derive from Java, and is the subject of much abuse in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>because</b> it is the reverse of [...] "free trade." [...] To understand its uses and beneficial effects, it is necessary first to sketch the common results of free European trade with uncivilized peoples.|$|E

Don't cry, little woman; I may live to vex you yet. Well, I shan't take either of my horses, but shall ride the General's grey charger: it's cheaper, and I told him mine was lame. If I'm done, those two ought to fetch you something. Grigg offered ninety for the mare yesterday, before this confounded news came, and like a fool I wouldn't let her go under the two o's.

Please to put THAT up the spout, ma'am, with my pins, and rings, and watch and chain, and things. They cost a precious lot of money. Miss Crawley, I know, paid a hundred down for the chain and ticker. Gold tops and bottles, indeed! dammy, I'm sorry I didn't take more now. Edwards pressed on me a silver-gilt boot-jack, and I might have had a dressing-case fitted up with a silver warming-pan, and a service of plate.
