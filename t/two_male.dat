5|$|After a duel, it {{is common}} for <b>two</b> <b>male</b> giraffes to caress and court each other. Such {{interactions}} between males {{have been found to be}} more frequent than heterosexual coupling. In one study, up to 94 percent of observed mounting incidents took place between males. The proportion of same-sex activities varied from 30–75 percent. Only one percent of same-sex mounting incidents occurred between females.|$|E

5|$|Flowers {{are usually}} borne {{in groups of}} three—one female flower {{together}} with <b>two</b> <b>male</b> flowers. In some species groups of four flowers (<b>two</b> <b>male</b> and two female) have been reported. At {{the far end of}} the inflorescence, away from the axis of the tree, pairs of male flowers replace the triads of male and female flowers. Flower colour is poorly known. It must be recorded from live plants, since preserved flowers lose their colour over time, and records of these species in the wild are incomplete. Male flowers tend to fall into two groups—those with cream or yellow flowers and those with some amount of purple in the flowers. Female flowers are even less well known than male flowers.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the skulls of <b>two</b> <b>male</b> Barbary lions (now {{extinct in}} the wild) from {{northwest}} Africa {{were found in}} the moat area of the Tower. Radicarbon tests dated them from 1280-1385 and 1420-1480. During 2011 an exhibition was hosted at the Tower with fine wire sculptures by Kendra Haste.|$|E
5|$|M. inclemens {{is one of}} the 11 {{species in}} genus Maevia. The species was first called Attus inclemens, and other names have been used.

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have indicated that}} Sholay contains homosocial themes. Ted Shen describes the male bonding shown in the film as bordering on camp style. Dina Holtzman, in her book Bollywood and Globalization: Indian Popular Cinema, Nation, and Diaspora, states that the death of Jai, and resultant break of bonding between the <b>two</b> <b>male</b> leads, {{is necessary for the}} sake of establishing a normative heterosexual relationship (that of Veeru and Basanti).|$|E
5|$|Daniel Velez {{represented}} Puerto Rico {{as one of}} its <b>two</b> <b>male</b> swimmers at the Beijing Olympics.

Of the 63 competitors who finished the event, Velez placed 33rd. He did not advance to later rounds.|$|E
5|$|Epaminondas was {{considered}} the greatest warrior-statesmen of ancient Thebes by many, including the Roman historian Diodorus Siculus. Diodorus does {{not have anything to}} say about the sexual orientation of Epaminondas or the Sacred Band, nor does he say anything about the following account, again from Plutarch (Amatorius 17). According to Plutarch's dramatic dialogue, Epaminondas had <b>two</b> <b>male</b> lovers: Asopichus and Caphisodorus, the latter died with him at Mantineia in battle. They were buried together, something usually reserved for a husband and wife in Greek society.|$|E

5|$|Only nine quagga {{catshark}} specimens {{have been}} recorded. In addition to Alcock's type specimen, four males were trawled from off the eastern Somalian coast {{by the research}} ship RV Anton Bruun in 1964. Four more individuals, <b>two</b> <b>male</b> and two female, were found amongst the contents of commercial fishing trawls conducted off Quilon, India in 2010. A male specimen reported from the Gulf of Aden in 1939 was later re-identified as a speckled catshark (H. boesemani).|$|E

Zuluaga, {{who had a}} fractured spine, broken ribs and a dislocated hip, was the second passenger {{to be found in}} possession of cocaine packages, after doctors operating on Jose Figueroa on the day after the crash to stop internal bleeding had also discovered packets of cocaine.They pleaded guilty to second-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance. Figueroa was sentenced to seven years to life in prison, and Zuluaga was sentenced to six years to life.|$|E

5|$|Hal Nerdal {{competed in}} Nordic combined, {{the only time}} that Australia has participated in the event at the Olympics, and {{finished}} last. Four years after injury prevented them from competing, Bower and Mason recorded Australia's best result, placing 12th in the pairs figure skating, although they were still second to last. Hickey and <b>two</b> <b>male</b> figure skaters—who were close to last—were the only Australians to place in the top 20, while Christine Davy became the first Australian to break into the top 30 in a skiing event, although she too was in the bottom 20% of the competition. The athletes were accompanied by seven staff members, the largest Australian support contingent until 1988. Chisholm mistakenly noted in his official report that it was Australia's second participation, forgetting the delegations sent in 1936, 1952 and 1956.|$|E
5|$|The Cayman Islands first {{participated in}} the Olympics when they sent <b>two</b> <b>male</b> athletes {{to compete in the}} Montreál 1976 Summer Olympic Games. Between then and Beijing, the Cayman Islands participated in eight Olympic games, {{including}} every summer Olympic competition excluding the Moscow 1980 Summer Olympics. The number of Caymanian athletes participating in Olympic events peaked at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona with ten athletes, but has since fallen. In the Beijing Olympics, the Cayman Islands sent four athletesthree men and a womanto participate in two distinct sports. Two athletes progressed to post-preliminary rounds (Ronald Forbes and Cydonie Mothersille) in their events, and Mothersille, ranked eighth in the final round of her event. However, as of and including its participation in Beijing, the Cayman Islands had yet to medal. Ronald Forbes carried the Caymanian flag at ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{round of}} gunfire killed only the Emperor, the Empress and <b>two</b> <b>male</b> servants, and wounded Grand Duchess Maria, Dr Botkin and the Empress' maidservant, Demidova. At {{that point the}} gunmen {{had to leave the}} room because of smoke and toxic fumes from their guns and plaster dust their bullets had {{released}} from the walls. After allowing the haze to clear for several minutes, the gunmen returned. Dr Botkin was killed, and a gunman named Ermakov repeatedly tried to shoot Tsarevich Alexei, but failed because jewels sewn into the boy's clothes shielded him. Ermakov tried to stab Alexei with a bayonet but failed again, and finally Yurovsky fired two shots into the boy's head. Yurovsky and Ermakov approached Olga and Tatiana, who were crouched against the room's rear wall, clinging to each other and screaming for their mother. Ermakov stabbed both young women with his 8-inch bayonet, but had difficulty penetrating their torsos because of the jewels that had been sewn into their chemises. The sisters tried to stand, but Tatiana was killed instantly when Yurovsky shot her {{in the back of her}} head. A moment later, Olga too died when Ermakov shot her in the head.|$|E

5|$|The team {{representing}} Australia at the 2006 Winter Olympics was Mitchell Allan (halfpipe), Torah Bright (halfpipe), Andrew Burton (halfpipe), Holly Crawford (halfpipe), Damon Hayler (snowboard cross), Ben Mates (halfpipe), Emanuel Oppliger (parallel giant slalom), Johanna Shaw (parallel giant slalom) and Emily Thomas (snowboard cross). Bright came fifth, and Hayler came seventh, and {{the pair}} {{were the only}} Australians—apart from Oppliger (15th)—to finish in {{the top half of}} their respective events. In 2010, Bright returned and won gold. After falling in her first run in the final—only the highest of the two runs is counted—she had to perform her second run before all the other competitors as she was ranked last after the first phase, and produced the top-score, which the others could not match. Crawford came eighth in the final. Australia's <b>two</b> <b>male</b> competitors Mates and Scott James finished {{in the middle of the}} field and missed the finals. In the snowboard cross, Hayler came tenth, while Alex Pullin was fastest in the qualification time trial, but crashed in the first round of racing, while the sole female racer Stephanie Hickey finished near bottom. Shaw was again Australia's sole slalom racer, and ended in the bottom half.|$|E

5|$|When {{the rest}} of the office is told of Phyllis' injury, they take this as {{confirmation}} that the Cafe Disco is a bad idea and reprimand Michael for what happened to Phyllis. Disappointed and angry, Michael instructs Erin (Ellie Kemper) to close up the Cafe Disco. Kelly (Mindy Kaling) comes down with her and the two start dancing after Erin turns on the stereo. This catches the eye of <b>two</b> <b>male</b> employees from Vance Refrigeration, and soon Cafe Disco is full of both Dunder Mifflin employees and non-employees, much to Michael's delight. Oscar (Oscar Nunez) is mildly baffled that Erin actually invited one of her friends to come, as opposed to being ashamed of the office. Kelly and Andy (Ed Helms) get into a competitive dance-off with each other, and Kevin (Brian Baumgartner) makes out in the corner with his girlfriend Lynne (Lisa K. Wyatt).|$|E
