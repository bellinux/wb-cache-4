50|$|The {{classification}} and phylogenetic {{relationships of}} the African <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> has remained in dispute. It {{has historically been}} placed under Catopuma, Felis or Profelis. However, studies in 2006 and 2009 have showed that the African <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> has a particularly {{close relationship with the}} caracal (Caracal caracal). These two species, together with the serval (Leptailurus serval), form one of the eight lineages of Felidae. This lineage evolved nearly 8.5 Mya. More recently, the African <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> has been considered a species of Caracal. The African <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> resembles the Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat,</b> but are not closely related.|$|R

40|$|Background. The bay cat Catopuma badia is {{endemic to}} Borneo, whereas its sister species the Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> Catopuma temminckii is {{distributed}} from the Himalayas and southern China through Indochina, Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra. Based onmorphological data, {{up to five}} subspecies of the Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> have been recognized, but a taxonomic assessment, including molecular data and morphological characters, is still lacking. Results. We combined molecular data (whole mitochondrial genomes), morphological data (pelage) and species distribution projections (up to the Late Pleistocene) to infer how environmental changes may have influenced the distribution of these sister species over the past 120 000 years. The molecular analysis was based on sequenced mitogenomes of 3 bay cats and 40 Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cats</b> derived mainly from archival samples. Our molecular data suggested a time of split between the two species approximately 3. 16 Ma and revealed very low nucleotide diversity within the Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> population, which supports recent expansion of the population. Discussion. The low nucleotide diversity suggested a population bottleneck in the Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat,</b> possibly caused by the eruption of the Toba volcano in Northern Sumatra (approx. 74 kya), followed by a continuous population expansion in the Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene. Species distribution projections, {{the reconstruction of the}} demographic history, a genetic isolation-by-distance pattern and a gradual variation of pelage pattern support the hypothesis of a post-Toba population expansion of the Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> from south China/Indochina to PeninsularMalaysia and Sumatra. Our findings reject the current classification of five subspecies for the Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat,</b> but instead support either a monotypic species or one comprising two subspecies: (i) the Sunda <b>golden</b> <b>cat,</b> distributed south of the Isthmus of Kra: C. t. temminckii and (ii) Indochinese, Indian, Himalayan and Chinese <b>golden</b> <b>cats,</b> occurring north of the Isthmus: C. t. moormensis...|$|R
25|$|The Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> {{is similar}} to the bay cat of Borneo in both {{appearance}} and behavior. Genetic studies revealed that the two species are closely related. The Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> is found in Sumatra and Malaysia, which separated from Borneo only about 10,000 to 15,000 years ago. These observations led to the belief that the Borneo bay cat is an insular subspecies of the Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat.</b> Genetic analysis has shown that the Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat,</b> along with the bay cat and the marbled cat, diverged from the other felids about 9.4 million years ago, and that the Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> and bay cat diverged as long as four million years ago, suggesting that the bay cat was a different species long before the isolation of Borneo. Because of the evident close relationship with the marbled cat, it has recently been suggested that all three species should be grouped in the genus Pardofelis.|$|R
50|$|The African <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> {{is listed}} in CITES Appendix II. Hunting African <b>golden</b> <b>cats</b> is {{prohibited}} in Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Congo, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone. In Gabon, Liberia and Togo, hunting regulations are in place.|$|R
25|$|The Asian <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> bears a great {{resemblance}} to the African <b>golden</b> <b>cat,</b> but {{it is unlikely that}} they are closely related because the forests of Africa and Asia have not been connected in over 20 million years. Their similarity is more likely an example of convergent evolution.|$|R

50|$|Genetic {{analysis}} {{has shown that}} caracal, African <b>golden</b> <b>cat</b> and serval are genetically closely related and diverged from a common ancestor about 5.4 million years ago.
