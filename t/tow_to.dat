5|$|Gromoboi was refloated and {{was sold}} to a German company for {{scrapping}} on 1 July 1922; she ran aground in a storm near Liepāja while under <b>tow</b> <b>to</b> Germany in October 1922. She was scrapped in place.|$|E
5|$|In 1885 Resistance {{began to}} be used as a target for the testing of armour against the effects of torpedoes and gunfire. She was sold for scrap on 11 November 1898. She foundered in Holyhead Bay whilst under <b>tow</b> <b>to</b> the {{breakers}} on 4 March 1899 and was later raised and scrapped at Garston, Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Assiniboine {{returned}} to Canada in June and was briefly {{used as a}} troop transport before a boiler room fire on 4 July effectively ended her career. She was paid off on 8 August and placed on the disposal list. Whilst on <b>tow</b> <b>to</b> the breakers in Baltimore, she ran aground near East Point, Prince Edward Island. Attempts to get her off failed, and she was left to rust until eventually being broken up in place in 1952.|$|E
50|$|In April 1947 HMS Warspite ran aground here whilst being <b>towed</b> <b>to</b> the {{breakers}} yard. She was later <b>towed</b> <b>to,</b> beached and broken up at Marazion.|$|R
50|$|Drydock YFD-64 {{remained}} {{on the west coast}} until 15 December 1944 when she was <b>towed</b> <b>to</b> Pearl Harbor. On 25 January 1945 she was towed into Eniwetok and then on to Ulithi. She was next <b>towed</b> <b>to</b> San Pedro Bay where she worked until November when she was <b>towed</b> <b>to</b> Guam. She decommissioned there on 8 June 1946.|$|R
50|$|On Saturday 3 May 1879 a {{temporary}} lightvessel was <b>towed</b> <b>to</b> the Sevenstones from Milford {{by the new}} Trinity House yacht Siren and the old vessel <b>towed</b> <b>to</b> London.|$|R
5|$|The {{battered}} Junon {{was taken}} in <b>tow</b> <b>to</b> Halifax, Nova Scotia, where she was repaired and later commissioned into the Royal Navy under the same name. The prisoners were also landed in Nova Scotia, including Rousseau, who died from his wounds soon afterwards. The French lost approximately 130 casualties; British losses were seven killed and 26 wounded on Horatio, six wounded on Latona and one man wounded on Driver.|$|E
5|$|The tug Atlantic Elm {{lost its}} <b>tow</b> <b>to</b> the {{unmanned}} barge Portland Star on October19. The barge was carrying over 18,000 tonnes of cement and diesel fuel {{and was later}} reported to have sunk in the Fortune Bay. Damage was reported to numerous pleasure craft around the bay due to the waves; two sailboats were toppled. Also, ferry service between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia was disrupted. Several offshore buoys and ships reported high winds and low barometric pressure, as well as waves of up to 16.9m (55ft).|$|E
5|$|After {{covering}} the landing force for two days, HMAS Vendetta, Barcoo and Swan proceeded to Wide Bay and bombarded Japanese positions there before departing the New Britain area. The motor launches ML 802 and ML 827 remained at Jacquinot Bay and conducted patrols {{along the south}} coast of the island in search of Japanese barges. ML 827 ran aground during a patrol on 17 November, and sank three days later while under <b>tow</b> <b>to</b> an Allied base; all of her crew survived. A Japanese air raid was conducted against Jacquinot Bay on 23 November.|$|E
50|$|Calypso {{was later}} <b>towed</b> <b>to</b> Marseille, France, where she lay {{neglected}} for two years. Thereafter she was <b>towed</b> <b>to</b> the basin of the Maritime Museum of La Rochelle in 1998, {{where she was}} intended to be an exhibit.|$|R
50|$|<b>Towed</b> <b>to</b> Falmouth, the frigate was {{declared}} a constructive total loss. The ship was paid {{off by the}} Royal Canadian Navy on 4 May 1945 {{and returned to the}} Royal Navy. The ship was <b>towed</b> <b>to</b> Llanelly, Wales and broken up in 1946.|$|R
50|$|On November 29, 2010, Dong Fang Ocean {{collided}} in the South China Sea {{with the}} Malta-flagged cargo ship, Aali. Both vessels were severely damaged in the incident, and Aali was <b>towed</b> <b>to</b> Weihai and Dong Fang Ocean was <b>towed</b> <b>to</b> Longyan Port in Shandong.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Old Bay Line's {{dissolution}} in April 1962, three ships remained docked at the Pratt Street pier: the District of Columbia, which had been kept as a spare since the Washington–Norfolk service ended in 1957, was scrapped soon afterwards. The City of Richmond was sold for use as a floating restaurant in the Virgin Islands, but sank in the Atlantic Ocean off Georgetown, South Carolina, while under <b>tow</b> <b>to</b> her new home. The City of Norfolk was idled in Norfolk until 1966, when it was towed to Fieldsboro, New Jersey on the Delaware River and scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Both Foudroyant and Lion {{were too}} {{battered}} {{to provide an}} effective <b>tow</b> <b>to</b> the dismasted French ship, {{and as a result}} Penelope was left to bring the shattered Guillaume Tell into Syracuse on Sicily. Eventually the ship was repaired sufficiently for the journey to Britain, and there was added to the Royal Navy under the name HMS Malta. Malta was, with HMS Tonnant captured two years earlier at the Nile, the most powerful third rate in the British fleet, and served for many years, participating at the Battle of Cape Finisterre in 1805.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{assigned}} to the Channel Fleet upon commissioning in 1865. Scorpion was refitted in 1867 with a flying bridge that connected the forecastle to the poop, above the tops of the turrets, and her sailing rig was reduced to a fore-and-aft rig. The ship recommissioned in 1868 for another tour with the Channel Fleet. She arrived in Bermuda in November 1869 where she became the local guard ship. In 1873 a proposal was made to remove her poop and forecastle, masts and deck fitting to convert her to a harbour defence monitor with all-around fire, but this was deemed too expensive and the project was abandoned in 1878. At some point during her service in Bermuda her rigging was removed and she was reduced to simple pole masts. The ship was fitted with searchlights and quick-firing guns in 1890. Scorpion was sunk as a target in 1901; she was raised in 1902 and sold in February 1903 for £736. She sank while under <b>tow</b> <b>to</b> Boston, Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|Hersing {{attacked}} {{a convoy of}} fifteen merchant ships escorted by fourteen destroyers in August south-west of Ireland. He took U-21 {{between two of the}} escorting destroyers and briefly used his periscope to gauge the speed and course of the transports before firing two torpedoes and diving. Hersing reported both torpedoes hit and the destroyers immediately rushed to begin their depth charge attacks. After a five-hour hunt, the destroyers withdrew to rejoin the convoy. The experience led Hersing to change tactics in future attacks on escorted convoys; instead of attacking the ships {{from as far away as}} possible, he chose to fire his torpedoes at closer range and then dive under the transport ships, where the destroyers would be unable to launch their depth charges for fear of damaging the transports. As of 1918, she was assigned to the III U-boat Flotilla. Later in 1918, the submarine was used as a training boat for new crews. She survived the war, but on 22 February 1919, she accidentally sank in the North Sea while under <b>tow</b> <b>to</b> Britain, where she would be formally surrendered.|$|E
5|$|She {{acted as}} a royal yacht for Crown Prince Umberto's 1924 tour of South America and then {{deployed}} to the Indian Ocean to support operations in Italian Somaliland in 1925–26. San Giorgio served as a training ship from 1930 to 1935 and was then rebuilt in 1937–38 to better serve in that role. As part of her reconstruction, she received a modern anti-aircraft suite that was augmented before she was transferred to bolster the defences of Tobruk shortly before Italy declared war on the Allies in mid-1940. San Giorgio was forced to scuttle herself in early 1941 as the Allies moved in to occupy the port. Her wreck {{was used as an}} immobile repair ship by the British from 1943 through 1945. Salvaged in 1952, she sank while under <b>tow</b> <b>to</b> Italy to be broken up.|$|E
5|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and the lack of a perceived threat against the United States came drastic cuts to the defense budget and the battleships were deemed uneconomical; as a result, Iowa was decommissioned for the last time on 26 October 1990, after a total of 19 years of commissioned service. She {{was the first of the}} reactivated battleships to be decommissioned, and this was done earlier than originally planned as a result of the damaged turret. Iowa was originally berthed at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and later at Naval Station Newport in Newport, Rhode Island from 24 September 1998 to 8 March 2001, when the ship began her journey under <b>tow</b> <b>to</b> California. The ship arrived in Suisun Bay near San Francisco on 21 April 2001 and joined the reserve fleet there, where she remained in reserve until struck again from the Naval Vessel Register in March 2006. She and her sister ships had been struck previously in 1995. She remained at the Suisun Bay anchorage until November 2011.|$|E
25|$|On 30 April 1992 Europa {{collided}} with the Greece-registered container ship Inchon Glory outside Hong Kong. No passengers on board Europa were injured. Initially she was <b>towed</b> <b>to</b> Kaohsiung, Taiwan, where passengers were evacuated. Subsequently the ship was <b>towed</b> <b>to</b> Singapore for repairs. After lengthy repairs Europa re-entered service on 7 July 1992.|$|R
5000|$|Shepparton {{paid off}} to reserve on 10 May 1946. She was <b>towed</b> <b>to</b> Sydney by sister ship [...] in early November 1947, where she {{remained}} until her sale for scrap on 20 February 1958. Shepparton {{was sold to}} the Mitsubishi Shoji Kaisha company, and was <b>towed</b> <b>to</b> Japan by the Shitako Maru.|$|R

5|$|Dividing the {{captured}} British sailors, Lejoille transferred half to Généreux and left half on Leander with a French prize crew under Louis Gabriel Deniéport. In direct contravention {{of the established}} conventions of war, both sets of prisoners were immediately ordered to effect repairs to the vessels. Only once both ships were ready for the journey to Corfu were the prisoners given bread and water, although the wounded were still denied medical attention. For ten days after the engagement the battered ships sailed northwards against the wind, Généreux forced to attach a <b>tow</b> <b>to</b> Leander to avoid leaving the prize behind. On 28 August, a sail appeared to the south. Panic broke out on Généreux, and Lejoille ordered the prisoners confined below and for preparations {{to be made to}} abandon Leander and make all speed for Corfu. The new arrival was in fact the 16-gun British sloop HMS Mutine under Lieutenant Thomas Bladen Capel, carrying the second copies of Nelson's despatches to Britain. Capel sighted the ships to the north, but assumed that they were Généreux and Guillaume Tell and so passed by displaying French colours. Lejoille was not fooled by the disguise but did not pursue the small vessel, continuing his passage to Corfu once Mutine had sailed out of sight.|$|E
5|$|Since {{being brought}} to London Belfast has twice been drydocked {{as part of the}} ship’s {{long-term}} preservation. In 1982 she was docked at Tilbury, and in June 1999 Belfast was towed to Portsmouth. This {{was the first time she}} had been to sea in 28 years and thus required a Certificate of Seaworthiness from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. While in dock, her entire hull was cleaned, blasted, and repainted, her hull blanking plates inspected and an ultrasonic survey carried out. She is not expected to require further drydocking until 2020. While under <b>tow</b> <b>to</b> Portsmouth she was delayed by bad weather and arrived a day late: it had been intended that she would arrive on 6 June 1999, the fifty-fifth anniversary of the Normandy landings. During the maintenance work, Belfast hull and topsides were repainted in her specific camouflage scheme officially known as Admiralty Disruptive Camouflage Type 25, which she had worn from November 1942 to July 1944. This was objected to by some, due to the anachronistic conflict between her camouflage, which reflects the majority of her active Second World War service, and her present configuration, which was the result of the ship's extended refit from January 1956 to May 1959. With the establishment of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport's (DCMS) Advisory Committee on National Historic Ships in 2006, Belfast was listed as part of the National Historic Fleet.|$|E
5|$|It was {{probably}} William the Conqueror {{who gave the}} city and its castle to Bishop Odo of Bayeux, the king's half brother. On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in <b>tow</b> <b>to</b> demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification {{was probably}} abandoned shortly afterwards. The siege-castles were abandoned after the conclusion of the siege and have since vanished.|$|E
