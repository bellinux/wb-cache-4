40|$|We study {{theoretically}} and experimentally {{the transmission}} intensity of polarized {{light through the}} air-spaced Glan-type polarizing prsims. It is found that the variation of the transmitted intensity with the rotation angle deviates from Malus Law, exhibiting a cyclic fluctuation with the rotation angle. The occurrence of the disturbance is explained {{by the use of}} an argument based on the interference effect produced from the air-gap in the prisms. The theoretcal results are well agreed with the experimental ones. By selecting the proper cut angle <b>of</b> <b>prism</b> and reducing the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> air-gap in <b>prism,</b> the disturbance may be minimized.

50|$|This is most {{commonly}} achieved {{through the use}} <b>of</b> fresnel <b>prisms.</b> These slim flexible plastic prisms can {{be attached to the}} patient's glasses, or to plano glasses if the patient has no refractive error, and serve to compensate for the inward misalignment of the affected eye. Unfortunately, the prism only correct for a fixed degree of misalignment and, because the affected individual's degree of misalignment will vary depending upon their direction of gaze, they may still experience diplopia when looking to the affected side. The prisms are available in different strengths and the most appropriate one can be selected for each patient. However, in patients with large deviations, the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>prism</b> required may reduce vision so much that binocularity is not achievable. In such cases it may be more appropriate simply to occlude one eye temporarily. Occlusion would never be used in infants though both because of the risk of inducing stimulus deprivation amblyopia and because they do not experience diplopia.|$|R
40|$|Electron {{backscatter}} diffraction is used {{to characterize}} the transition interface between aragonite prisms and nacre in two species of freshwater molluscs, Anodonta anatina (Linnaeus, 1758) and Anodonta cygnea (L. 1758). In the duck mussel, Anodonta anatina, the shell thickness is comprised mainly of nacre with only a thin outer prismatic layer, whereas in the swan mussel, A. cygnea, the shell comprises a greater <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> aragonite <b>prisms</b> relative to the nacreous layer. In A. anatina, the prism−nacre interface is flat and featureless. In A. cygnea, the nacre below the base <b>of</b> the <b>prisms</b> is characterized by distinct concave footholds. In both species, the c-axis of aragonite nanogranules comprising the prisms is parallel with the prism length. This crystallographic orientation, with the c-axis perpendicular to the shell exterior, occurs in the nacreous layer and thus is conserved throughout the shell thickness. In A. cygnea alternate prisms have a crystallographic orientation with the c-axis deviating from the prism long axis by approximately 20 deg. The initial nacreous layer adopts the crystallographic orientation <b>of</b> the preceding <b>prisms</b> and subsequent nacreous laminae are oriented in register with the bulk nacre. This {{is consistent with the}} hypothesis that nacre evolved through horizontal partitioning <b>of</b> <b>prisms.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The Sunda {{subduction}} margin, {{the location}} of recent magnitude 8 - 9 megathrust earthquakes, is characterized by major changes in prism and forearc morphology and structure along its 5000 ?km length. On the Sumatra-Andaman section, measurements <b>of</b> <b>prism</b> width and surface slope (?) indicate along-strike segments, including abrupt changes, <b>of</b> <b>prism</b> morphology: (1) a narrow and steep prism between Burma and the Andamans; (2) broad with an averaged gentle slope in the Andamans, Nicobars and North Sumatra; (3) steep and narrow in Central Sumatra; and (4) wider and less steep offshore South Sumatra, decreasing in width to West Java. Prism width varies from ~ 90 - 180 ?km and average surface slope from ~ 1 - 3 ° with a strong inverse correlation between width and slope, also observed globally. The prism deviates from typical taper geometry {{in parts of the}} margin, notably offshore North Sumatra where it is characterized by a steep toe and broad plateau. Along-strike changes in morphology are strongly linked to input sediment <b>thickness.</b> Sections <b>of</b> the <b>prism</b> toe represent key global examples of unusual landward-vergent thrusting. These sections correspond to a thick sediment input and to a wide prism with shallow surface slope. A low basal shear stress or backstop mechanism may drive this style <b>of</b> faulting. <b>Prism</b> morphology and structure appear to be driven predominantly by input sediment thickness linked to oceanic basement topography, with sediment properties, plate smoothness, and orthogonal subduction rate and obliquity also contributing, and no clear role of plate age or dip...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of glued steel fibres in high strength concrete with size reduction properties of concrete has been attempted. Glued steel fibres with both ends hooked having length to diameter ratio of 70 was added at a dosage level of 0. 5 % to 1. 5 % by volume fraction. The study {{was carried out}} to analyze the effects of fibre addition on the <b>thickness</b> reduction <b>of</b> concrete element. A high strength concrete mixture was designed and various <b>thicknesses</b> <b>of</b> concrete <b>prisms</b> were casted for different volume fraction of steel fibres. The hardened concrete properties were determined based on the mix constituents such as {{water to binder ratio}} 0. 3 (w/b), superplasticizer dosage, fine to coarse aggregate ratio 0. 6 (F/c), and fly ash replacement level at 25 % and 50 % by weight of binder content. The experimental test results showed that the flexural strength varies with respect to the depth of concrete specimen. It can be observed that the reduction in size up to 10 % size containing 25 % fly ash with 1. 5 % steel fibres showed better strength enhancement of 4. 70 [*]MPa and 6. 69 [*]MPa for 7 days and 28 days, respectively. Also, the addition of steel fibres at higher percentage of fly ash containing 50 % showed better improvement in the flexural strength for the size reduction at 5 %, when compared to plain concrete beam which exhibited higher stress carrying capacity of 6. 08 [*]MPa at 28 days and showed an increase of 7. 99 %...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} gravity {{interpretation}} method for esti-mating {{the relief of}} an arbitrary interface separating two homogeneous media. The upper medium is discretized into rectangular, juxtaposed prisms whose thicknesses represent the depths to the interface and are the param-eters to be estimated from the gravity anomaly. The den-sity contrast <b>of</b> each <b>prism</b> {{is assumed to be}} constant and known. To stabilize the inversion, we introduce two kinds of constraints on the depths. The first one requires prox-imity between the observed and computed depths at iso-lated points such as those obtained from boreholes (ab-solute equality constraint). The second one requires that groups of depths approximately follow an established linear relationship among the depths (relative equality constraint). Both kinds of constraints are imposed in the least-squares sense. We illustrate the method performance by applying it to a synthetic anomaly produced by a simulated basement relief consisting of four narrow and adjacent structural lows. Only two structural lows produced isolated gravity lows. Nonetheless, the whole basement topography was successfully reconstructed with an average error of 4 % of the maximum relief amplitude. In this example, the rela-tive constraints established that the <b>thicknesses</b> <b>of</b> adja-cent <b>prisms</b> should be {{as close as possible to}} each other (overall relief smoothness). As absolute constraints we used point information about the basement depth at five points. In addition to the overall relief smoothness, other relevant geologic information, such as localized relief smoothness, occurring at structural terraces, for exam-ple, can be incorporated by assigning different weights to the relative equality constraints. The method was applied to the gravity anomaly of Recôncavo Basin, Brazil, leading to a sharper definition of the basement features relative to previous gravity in-terpretations of this area...|$|R

40|$|We {{fabricated}} and {{replicated in}} semiconductor compatible plastics a multi-channel free-space optical interconnection module designed to establish infra-chip interconnections on an Opto-Electronic Field Programmable Gate Array (OE-FPGA). The micro-optical component is an assembly of a refractive lenslet-array and a high-quality microprism. Both components were prototyped using deep lithography with protons and were monolithically integrated using a vacuum casting replication technique. The resulting 16 channel module shows optical transfer efficiencies of 50 %. and inter-channel cross-talks {{as low as}} - 22 dB. These characteristics are sufficient to establish multi-channel infra-chip interconnects with OE-FPGA's. The OE-FPGA we used was designed within a European co-founded MEL-ARI consortium, working towards a manufacturable solution for optical interconnects between CMOS IC's. The optoelectronic chip combines fully functional FPGA digital logic with the drivers, receivers and flip-chipped optoelectronic components: It features 2 optical inputs and 2 optical outputs per FPGA cell, amounting to 256 photonic I/O links based on multi-mode 980 nm VCSELs and InGaAs detectors. With a careful alignment of the micro-optical free-space module above the OE-VLSI chip, we demonstrated {{for the first time}} to our knowledge multi-channel free-space intra-chip optical interconnections. Data-communication was achieved with 4 simultaneous channels working at 10 Mb/s. The bitrate was limited by the chiptester. Notwithstanding the use of non-aggressive 0. 6 mum CMOS technology the FPGA will provide an 80 Mbit/s information rate per channel using manchester encoded links. The whole chip therefore has in principle a peak aggregate signalling rate of approximately 20 GBit/s. Furthermore we investigated the possibilities of a more advanced interconnection module prototyped by combining an in-house fabricated baseplate with microlenses and a commercially available micro 3 D glass prism. With this approach the channel count is no longer limited by the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>prism</b> we can fabricate with deep lithography with protons. To conclude we report on the integration <b>of</b> this glass <b>prism</b> and our baseplate and on the first results obtained with this interconnection module...|$|R

40|$|Organic {{components}} of typical prismatic layers in several molluscan shells were reexamined by applying {{scanning electron microscopy}} to preparations treated with the freeze-dry or the critical-point-dry method, with the result showing the following: The interior <b>of</b> <b>prisms</b> is almost filled up with a spongy intraprismatic matrix. Also three principal types <b>of</b> <b>prisms</b> are distinguishable {{according to the state}} of development and the histochemical nature of a vertical (interprismatic) wall. Namely, <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> type 1 are separated from their neighbor by a rigid vertical wall, and are represented by calcite simple <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> Pinctada and aragonite simple <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> Anodonta: <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> type 2 are separated by a compound (partly rigid and partly spongy) vertical wall, and are represented by aragonite simple <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> Unio; <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> type 3 are separated by a spongy vertical wall, and are represented by composite <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> Tapes and Peronidia. These findings suggest that type 2 is intermediate between types 1 and 3, and that transformation of an interprismatic matrix from a "primitive" rigid matrix to a more "advanced" spongy one has probably taken place in the course <b>of</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>prisms.</b> In addition, the histochemical nature of the rigid matrix is acidophilic like the shell epidermis.

40|$|Prism {{adaptation}} induces rapid recalibration of visuomotor coordination. The neural mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>prism</b> adaptation {{have come}} under scrutiny since the observations that the technique can alleviate hemispatial neglect following stroke, and can alter spatial cognition in healthy controls. Relative to non-imaging behavioral studies, fMRI investigations <b>of</b> <b>prism</b> adaptation face several challenges arising from the confined physical environment of the scanner and the supine position of the participants. Any researcher who wishes to administer prism adaptation in an fMRI environment must adjust their procedures enough to enable the experiment to be performed, {{but not so much}} that the behavioral task departs too much from true prism adaptation. Furthermore, the specific temporal dynamics of behavioral components <b>of</b> <b>prism</b> adaptation present additional challenges for measuring their neural correlates. We developed a system for measuring the key features <b>of</b> <b>prism</b> adaptation behavior within an fMRI environment. To validate our configuration, we present behavioral (pointing) and head movement data from 11 right-hemisphere lesioned patients and 17 older controls who underwent sham and real prism adaptation in an MRI scanner. Most participants could adapt to prismatic displacement with minimal head movements, and the procedure was well tolerated.
