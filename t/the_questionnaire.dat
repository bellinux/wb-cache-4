The full, long version is one minute longer than the Making the Video version, while the cut version omits the scenes in which she leaves the airport and is sleepy and in which she fills out <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> The short version begins with Stefani practicing on the piano and her finding the watch just seconds after that. Her being billed is not shown in this version, so the video ends with the Harajuku Girls laughing at her performance.|$|E
5|$|The Financial Times {{poll was}} the result of over 10,000 {{respondents}} to nearly 23000 electronic questionnaires of alumni from 155 qualifying business schools. The survey began in July 2006 and all internationally accredited programs that are at least five years old and that have produced at least 30 graduates {{in each of the last}} three years were solicited. 113 of the 155 had at least 20 respondents and at least a 20 percent response rate. <b>The</b> <b>questionnaire</b> used twenty criteria in three main areas. The poll actually presents all twenty criteria to the reader. Eight criteria are based on alumni responses; eleven criteria are based on business school responses, and the final criterion is based on a research index produced by the Financial Times. The survey responses are audited by KPMG.|$|E
25|$|A {{positive}} example {{may be a}} clinician who uses an interview technique {{as well as a}} specific questionnaire to determine if a patient has mental illness and has better success at determining mental illness than a clinician who uses the interview technique alone.

Because <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> in conjunction with the interview produced more accurate determinations, and added information for the clinician, <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> is incrementally valid.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to examine whether internal auditors’ job performance and/or job satisfaction are related to differences in the personality variable locus-of-control. The data of the study was collected from the firms’ internal auditors at Central Java who completed and returned <b>the</b> <b>questionnaires.</b> <b>The</b> data was gotten by distributing <b>the</b> <b>questionnaires</b> directly to <b>the</b> respondents. 500 <b>questionnaires</b> was distributed and 80 of them (19, 20...|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>questionnaires</b> were {{distributed}} in two waves. In the first wave, the participants completed a questionnaire assessing their immediate supervisor’s transformational leadership, their positive affect, their perceived over-qualification and various demographic variables (<b>Questionnaire</b> A). <b>The</b> <b>questionnaires</b> {{were sent to}} the employees via email. To ensure anonymity, we asked the participants to return <b>the</b> completed <b>questionnaires</b> via a public email account created for the study. Two weeks later, we sent <b>the</b> participants another <b>questionnaire</b> measuring voice (Questionnaire B). To ensure that {{we would be able to}} match <b>the</b> two <b>questionnaires</b> for each respondent, we placed an identifying mark on each pair of questionnaires.|$|R
25|$|The current {{language}} in <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> now only restricts donors {{with a history}} of risky sexual behavior, regardless of the sexual orientation of the participant.

25|$|Supporters of {{different}} parties were recruited in different ways: Communists were recruited through party branches, fascists in an unspecified manner, {{and supporters of}} other parties by giving copies of <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> to his students and telling them to apply it to friends and acquaintances.|$|E
25|$|The {{dimensions}} {{taken into}} account are divided into: Basic Scales (which evaluate the most relevant features of personality), Content Scales (which analyse different variables of personality), Supplementary Scales (which further investigate {{some of the issues}} in the basic scales), Validity Scales (which define the degree of sincerity and accuracy in filling <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire).</b>|$|E
