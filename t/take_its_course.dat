5|$|The Jurassic Coast {{is subject}} to severe weather {{conditions}} at times. Violent storms occurred in 1824 and 1974, and these and various lesser storms have battered the cliffs and caused flooding and structural damage in coastal towns. The coast is largely an eroding landscape {{and management of the}} site aims to allow the natural processes of erosion to continue while protecting people and property. Coastal defences have been put in place in Charmouth and Weymouth, where houses are at risk, but in other places, where the coastline remains in a natural state, the management policy is to take no action and allow erosion to <b>take</b> <b>its</b> <b>course.</b>|$|E

500|$|Like Ferraro's {{previous}} albums Night Dolls with Hairspray and Last American Hero, Far Side Virtual explores American {{culture of}} the present and recent past. A writer from French music blog The Drone described Far Side Virtual as a concept album inspired by the ideas of hyperreality and simulacra from the post-modern cultural theorist Jean Baudrillard. Harper wrote, [...] "Up until Far Side Virtual, many of James Ferraro's albums were impressionistic lo-fi portraits of bygone eras – perhaps on Far Side Virtual he decided to represent the present as is and then let nature <b>take</b> <b>its</b> <b>course,</b> over time, and do the aging for him. Returning to it in ten or twenty years time, we might discover that it was ironically a victim of its own futurist acceleration, and is now about as up-to-date as a ten-year-old carton of milk." ...|$|E

[...] "Replete with a festive mandolin and a midtempo beat to bring new heights to her as-ever splendid vocal," [...] this song is [...] "destined to enrapture" [...] top forty and AC the first time through, at last stripping away mainstream radio's gripe that Dion is [...] "too adult". He said that, youthful and yet elegant, and glowing brightly with warmth, the song also represents a bold step forward for Martin, who is best known [...] for his work with chart-topping youth acts. All in all, [...] "That's the Way It Is" [...] is [...] "one of the most compelling radio releases yet" [...] from [...] "one of the core voices of the decade." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{the flora}} of Grand Teton National Park is {{generally}} healthy, the whitebark pine, {{and to a}} lesser degree the lodgepole pine, are considered at risk. In the case of the whitebark pine, an invasive species of fungus known as white pine blister rust weakens the tree, making it more susceptible to destruction from endemic mountain pine beetles. Whitebark pines generally thrive at elevations above [...] and produce large seeds that are high in fat content and an important food source for various species such as the [...] grizzly bear, red squirrel and Clark's nutcracker. The species {{is considered to be a}} keystone and a foundation species; keystone in that its [...] "ecological role (is) disproportionately large relative to its abundance" [...] and foundation in that it has a paramount role that [...] "defines ecosystem structure, function, and process". Whitebark pine has generally had a lower incidence of blister rust infection throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem than in other regions such as Glacier National Park and the Cascade Range. The incidence of blister rust on whitebark pines in Yellowstone National Park is slightly lower than in Grand Teton. Though blister rust is not in itself the cause of increased mortality, its weakening effect on trees allows native pine beetles to more easily infest the trees, increasing mortality. While general practice in National Parks is to allow nature to <b>take</b> <b>its</b> <b>course,</b> the alarming trend of increased disease and mortality of the vital whitebark pine trees has sparked a collaborative effort amongst various government entities to intervene to protect the species.|$|E
500|$|Tresham {{suffered}} from a strangury caused by an inflammation of his urinary tract, and in December 1605 his health began to decline. [...] Lieutenant of the Tower William Waad, wondering if Tresham would live long enough for justice to <b>take</b> <b>its</b> <b>course,</b> described his condition as [...] "worse and worse". [...] Tresham preferred {{the services of a}} Dr Richard Foster over those of the Tower's regular doctor Matthew Gwinne; apparently Foster understood his case, indicating that it was not the first occasion on which he had treated him. [...] During his last days he was attended by three more doctors and a nurse, along with William Vavasour, a rumoured illegitimate child of Thomas Tresham and possibly Francis's half-brother. [...] As Tresham's wife, Anne, was apparently too upset, Vavasour wrote Tresham's deathbed confession and also an account of his last hours. [...] Tresham apologised to the Jesuit priest Henry Garnet for implicating him in the Spanish Treason, and used the rest of his deathbed confession to protest his innocence. [...] Anne and William read prayers at his bedside; he died at 2:00am on 23December. [...] Despite not being tried, his head joined those of Catesby and Percy on display at Northampton, while his body was thrown into a hole at Tower Hill. [...] His estates passed to his brother Lewis. [...] Tresham's apology never reached its intended target, and his letter, along with the discovery of Garnet's Of Equivocation, found among the [...] "heretical, treasonable and damnable books" [...] at Tresham's chamber in the Inner Temple, was used to great effect by Sir Edward Coke in Garnet's trial. [...] The priest was executed in May 1606.|$|E

Shortly afterwards, the Chrétien government fulfilled its Red Book promise of 1993 by introducing the National Child Benefit program for the children of low-income parents. Through Chrétien and Martin still disliked each other on the account of the bruising 1990 leadership race, a cordial working relationship was established indirectly with Chrétien's right-hand man Eddie Goldenberg regularly meeting with Martin's aide Terrie O'Leary to work out mutually acceptable policies for the government to pursue. In March 1998, Chrétien won the leadership review required after every election by 90%. According to one of Chrétien's staffers at the PMO, Terry Mercer that: [...] "It was not long after the 98 convention that we began to see the first evidence that the Martin camp had no intention of letting nature <b>take</b> <b>its</b> <b>course,</b> and this began to cause problems throughout the system". In April 1998, the government attracted much criticism when the Health Minister Allan Rock waged a successful battle to limit the number of Canadians stricken with Hepatitis C through government negligence who could collect compensation for their suffering. Chrétien's biographer Lawrence Martin wrote that the attitude of Chrétien to the Hepatitis C victims was not unlike the [...] "heartless" [...] attitude that he during his time in the opposition he accused Mulroney of holding. Rock had wanted to compensate all of the hepatitis C victims, but was overruled by the prime minister, who told him the government would compensate only those afflicted between 1986 and 1990. The Liberal backbencher Carolyn Bennett was later to claim in an interview that it was unconscionable on the part of Chrétien to refuse to compensate all of the hepatitis C victims, and then to spend $57million in legal fees in a successful effort to stop hepatitis C activists from getting a ruling from the courts to compensate all victims.|$|E
