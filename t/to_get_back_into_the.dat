5|$|England won the toss and {{declined}} from 125/0 to 245 all out, {{the last five}} wickets tumbling for just 22 runs. Malcolm Marshall and Curtly Ambrose took all ten wickets between them. The West Indies racked up 448/9 despite no batsman reaching a century. England had a chance <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> match, but from 334/7, the unheralded batting of Marshall (72) and Ambrose (43*) took the tourists into a position of dominance.|$|E
5|$|Anderlecht {{began the}} second half the better of the two sides as they pushed forward {{in an attempt to}} extend their lead. Rensenbrink, in particular, was in good form as he caused {{numerous}} problems for Liverpool defender Emlyn Hughes, who started because of an injury to Phil Thompson after being absent himself for a lengthy period. Liverpool replaced David Johnson with midfielder Steve Heighway in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> match but it was to no avail as Anderlecht extended their lead late in {{the second half}} when Rensenbrink scored. No further goals were scored and the referee Károly Palotai blew for full-time with the final score 3–1 to Anderlecht.|$|E
5|$|As the Dalek discovers Rose, {{the video}} feeds to the Vault are lost, and the Doctor {{immediately}} sets off to try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Vault. The Dalek tries to kill Rose but it cannot, having found compassion from Rose's DNA. The Dalek is urged to kill van Statton, but Rose instead convinces to spare his life. She follows the Dalek {{as it makes}} {{its way to the}} highest part of the Vault and destroys the roof, exposing the area to natural sunlight that the Dalek basks in. The Doctor arrives and prepares to kill the Dalek, but Rose stops him, convincing him the Dalek has developed emotions. However, the Dalek is unable to cope with them, and it asks Rose to orders its own self-destruction to end its pain. Rose reluctantly agrees, and the Dalek shortly implodes thereafter.|$|E

5|$|As the peloton {{approached}} the Côte de la Redoute, {{there was a}} large crash. Among the riders to crash were two previous winners of the race, Dan Martin and Simon Gerrans, as well as Fränk Schleck (Trek Factory Racing), Nicolas Roche (Sky), Mathias Frank (IAM) and Yukiya Arashiro (Europcar). Vincenzo Nibali was forced to unclip himself from his bike, but avoided crashing. The peloton was reduced to around 40 riders {{at the foot of the}} climb. Although there were no bad injuries in the crash, Roche and Arashiro took some time to stand up, with Roche looking particularly dazed. Many of the riders who crashed attempted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> peloton, with Gerrans and Martin among them. Gerrans was forced to abandon the race shortly afterwards after he crashed for a second time.|$|E
5|$|April brought further roster {{changes for}} the Hershey Bears, with Joel Rechlicz rejoining the team in {{exchange}} for Matt Clackson, and Stafford being traded for winger Dane Byers. Forward Michael Latta was also traded to Hershey, meaning the team had added seven new players to the roster via trades since January 31. The April trades were intended to add forward speed and depth to the team, but a late NHL trade deadline resulting from the lockout left only nine james to meld the new players into the line-up. After beating Syracuse 4–1 on April 5, Hershey fell into a four-game losing slump that briefly knocked them out of playoff contention. The first of those games, a 2-1 loss against Syracuse at home, drew a season-high attendance of 10,943. However, by April 12, a loss against Providence knocked them into ninth place, and last place in the East Division. Another loss {{the next day to}} Manchester left them tied with the Monarchs for last place at 75 points, a full four points behind Connecticut and Norfolk <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> running for the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{two main}} event matches came next, as Randy Savage defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against the Ultimate Warrior. Although Mr. Perfect had claimed {{that he would be}} in the corner of one of the competitors, he did not come to ringside for the {{beginning}} of the match. Savage and the Warrior traded the advantage back and forth, with Savage performing several clotheslines and punching his opponent and the Ultimate Warrior countering with atomic drops. Savage executed two double axe handles from the top rope, but the Warrior caught him when Savage attempted the move a third time. After the Warrior missed a move and fell outside the ring, Savage jumped from the top rope and performed another double axe handle. Once the wrestlers got back into the ring, Ric Flair and Mr. Perfect walked down the aisle and stood at ringside. The match continued as normal until Perfect reached into the ring and tripped Savage, who was running to gain momentum for a maneuver. The Ultimate Warrior accidentally threw Savage into referee Earl Hebner. As a result of the ref bump, Hebner was not able to make the three-count when Savage pinned the Warrior after performing a diving elbow drop. Perfect and Flair revived the Ultimate Warrior, only to attack him when he stood up. The Warrior recovered and attempted a running splash, but Flair hit him with a chair. Savage saw the Warrior injured and realized that Flair and Perfect were causing trouble rather than trying to help either man. In retaliation, Savage jumped off the top rope to attack Flair, but Flair hit him in the leg with a chair. Savage was unable <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ring, so the Ultimate Warrior won the match via countout. Flair and Perfect continued to attack Savage until the Warrior chased them away. Savage and the Ultimate Warrior then hugged and walked backstage together.|$|E

25|$|England {{went into}} the fourth test still 2-0 down in the series, but knowing they had been reprieved by the weather in the third, and {{in desperate need of}} a win <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> series.

25|$|The club's unbeaten run came to {{a disappointing}} end after a poor home display against Bolton Wanderers. Middlesbrough found {{themselves}} two goals down after ten minutes, but {{had a number of}} chances to try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game. Pogatetz got a goal back for the home side after 77 minutes, but just 63 seconds later, Bolton scored their third to wrap up a 3–1 win. When Taylor was substituted during the game, he and a supporter got into an angry exchange of words, a situation for which Taylor later apologised.|$|E

25|$|Argentina's lead forced England into a double-attacking substitution, {{bringing}} on Barnes and Waddle, and {{it nearly}} paid off: as the Argentine team began to tire after their earlier efforts, England began to push further up the pitch, looking <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game. Driven by Glenn Hoddle and John Barnes, they created chances, and Gary Lineker scored his sixth {{goal of the}} tournament in the 80th minute from a Barnes cross. Argentina had further chances as well, with Carlos Tapia hitting {{the inside of the}} post immediately after England's goal. England were unable to score an equaliser and Argentina won the match 2–1.|$|E
25|$|Gripper {{made his}} debut for the Rhodesian cricket {{team in the}} 1957–58 season, playing 83 first class games in the Currie Cup for the {{territory}} between 1957–58 and 1971–72. He had an unbroken run playing for the team for eight years between 1958 and 1966, when he was dropped for a game against Transvaal. He later managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> team however, and he scored his best score of 279 not out against Orange Free State in the 1967–68 season. This score was a Currie Cup record for many years. Gripper also occasionally bowled some right-arm medium pace, taking 3 wickets {{at an average of}} forty runs apiece in his first class career.|$|E

25|$|In {{a rematch}} of the thrilling 2006 second-round series, the Pistons and Cavaliers matched up in {{perhaps one of}} the most closely contested series in NBA history, with the first five games being decided by six points or less. The {{spotlight}} fell on LeBron James. Despite gaining some momentum in the opening games of the series against the experienced Pistons, key last-second decisions by James led to Cleveland losses in Games 1 and 2 in Detroit, by identical scores, in which Cleveland led for most of the two games. They faced a 0–2 deficit for the second straight year, but would easily remember from the year before that they could win three straight games <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> series.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} quarter, Green Bay lost {{multiple}} chances <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game. First, Brooks' 43-yard punt return was nullified when Jim Jeffcoat deflected Favre's {{pass into the}} arms of defensive end Charles Haley on the next play. Dallas then drove 47 yards, including a 27-yard reception by Irvin, to score on Murray's 38-yard field goal and increase their lead to 27–10. The Packers responded with a drive from their 15 to the Dallas 15, but any hope of a miracle comeback was dashed on the 13th play when safety Darren Woodson ended the drive with an interception. In the last two minutes of the game, Green Bay scored on Favre's 29-yard touchdown throw to Sharpe, but by then the game was well out of reach.|$|E
25|$|After {{starting}} off slow, Lyon rebounded picking up two victories in their home-away series with Steaua. Similar to last season matches with VfB Stuttgart, Lyon used these matches <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> competition defeating Steaua 5–3 in Romania. They {{came back from}} a 2–0 deficit and a 3–2 one-goal deficit before finishing off the Romanian side in the latter portion of the second half with a goal from Benzema and a brace from Fred. The second match was a positive result as well, with Lyon picking up a solid 2–0 victory with goals from Juninho and Anthony Réveillère. With the result in the other match between Bayern and Fiorentina being a draw, this moved Lyon into first place in the group (on goal differential) heading into the final two matchdays.|$|E
