Witnesses described an orgy {{in which there}} was no [...] "respect for virtuous women"; others who testified, including those who had been in Russia during the Revolution, denied this. [...] After one witness read a Soviet decree saying that Russian women had the [...] "right to choose from among men", Senator Sterling <b>threw</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and declared that this was a negation of [...] "free love". However, another decree was produced stating, [...] "A girl having reached her eighteenth year is to be announced as the property of the state." ...|$|E
500|$|On May8, 1923, Hornsby {{suffered}} {{an injury to}} his left knee {{in a game against}} the Phillies when he turned to make a throw. He returned 10 days later, but the injury lingered, and he was removed from a game against the Pirates on May26 to be examined by Robert Hyland, the Cardinals' physician. Hyland had Hornsby's knee placed in a cast for two weeks, after which he returned to the Cardinals. During a game in August, Hornsby was on third base late in the game and <b>threw</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> in disgust in response to a sign flashed by Rickey; he had given the current batter the take sign, and Hornsby felt the batter should have hit the ball. After the game, he and Rickey fought in the clubhouse, but teammates quickly broke it up. Hornsby missed several games late in the year with injuries that the Cardinals (and Hyland) did not believe to be serious; as a result he was fined $500 ($ today) and suspended for the last five games of the year. However, Hornsby still won his fourth consecutive NL batting title with a batting average of [...]384. He also repeated as the leader in on-base percentage (.459) and slugging percentage (.627).|$|E

[...] According to his son, he was {{viewing the}} sunset, when he [...] <b>threw</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> {{into the air}} and exclaimed, [...] "My God! oh, how beautiful!", fell to the ground, and died minutes later. [...] A public funeral for Inness was held at the National Academy of Design, and a {{memorial}} exhibition was conducted at the Fine Arts Building in New York City.|$|E

2500|$|Thomas Hawkes {{burned to}} death in 1555 during the Marian Persecutions rather than allow his son to be baptised into the Roman Catholic Church. Responding to Edmund Bonner, the Bishop of London, who urged {{him to return to}} Catholicism, he is {{reported}} to have said: [...] "No my lord, that I will not, for if I had a hundred bodies I would suffer them all to be torn in pieces rather than I will abjure and recant." [...] As he burned, Hawkes <b>threw</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and clapped them three times, a sign to his friends that the pain could be endured. Hawkes' death and the circumstances leading up to it are recorded in detail in John Foxe's Book of Martyrs.|$|E
2500|$|Bickerdyke {{also worked}} closely with Eliza Emily Chappell Porter of Chicago's Northwestern branch of the United States Sanitary Commission. She later worked on the first {{hospital}} boat. During the war, she became chief of nursing {{under the command of}} General Ulysses S. Grant, and served at the Battle of Vicksburg. [...] As chief of nursing, Bickerdyke sometimes deliberately ignored military procedure, and when Grant's staff complained about her behavior, Union Gen. William T. Sherman reportedly <b>threw</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and exclaimed, [...] "She outranks me. I can't do a thing in the world." [...] Sherman acknowledged that she was [...] "one of his best generals" [...] and other officers referred to her as the [...] "Brigadier Commanding Hospitals." [...] Sherman was especially fond of this volunteer nurse, who followed the western armies. Bickerdyke held the favor of both General Sherman and General Grant, who often provided her whatever she requested of them.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was intense}} {{anticipation}} for the match against the Prime Minister's XI as the 54-year-old Sir Donald Bradman agreed to captain the team after 14 years without playing cricket. The thorough {{man that he}} was Bradman started practicing for the big day and 10,000 men, women and children came to see him bat for the last time. His old foe the MCC assistant-manager Alec Bedser agreed to play and the Bradman Pavilion was unveiled at the Manuka Oval. The Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies was a keen cricket fan who initiated these matches in 1951 and the money raised was donated to Legacy, a charity for the dependents of deceased Australian servicemen. Ted Dexter won the toss and elected to bat with Bradman fielding at first slip they rattled the fence with 36 fours and birthday-boy Fred Trueman hit a six. David Sheppard top-scored with 72 and Colin Cowdrey made 42. Richie Benaud took 2/62 off 8 overs, but the bowling honours went to the Canberra leg-spinner G. Brown, who took 3/61. Dexter nicked a ball off Brown to Wally Grout, but was called back by Bradman when he walked as the umpire gave him not out. [...] "Lord Ted" [...] lofted the next ball to Cowper at extra-cover and walked off for 22. Dexter declared the innings at 253/7, leaving the Prime Minister's XI 254 to win and Bob Cowper (47) and Ray Flockton (45) got the home team {{off to a good}} start with 7 boundaries apiece. They had both departed and the score was 108/3 when the name of Bradman came up on the board and the great man in a baggy green cap walked out to the crease to a standing ovation, surrounded by photographers and greeted by the England team. Tom Graveney's leg-spin got him off the mark with a straight-drive and in the next over from Brian Statham the Australian politician Don Chipp hit a single to put Bradman on strike. Although it was the intention of the MCC to let Bradman get some runs, and to bat against Bedser, Statham bowled a leg-cutter which came off the inside edge, brushed the pads and bounced onto the stumps with just enough force to dislodge a bail and the Don was out. Statham <b>threw</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> in anguish and the crowd was stunned, but [...] "the little man, after on brief look back at his broken wicket, walked quickly away, the step firm, the head erect, but the shoulders, one thought, now slightly stooped. He had made one scoring stroke, for four. The crowd watched him go and signed. How much they wanted just a half-hour, at least, of him - as the Englishmen had." [...] Ironically, in his last Test 14 years before he had been bowled by Eric Hollies for a duck, four runs short of a Test average of 100.00. He reached the pavilion to the commiserations of the Prime Minister and the Duke of Norfolk and told them [...] "It wouldn't happen in a thousand years. Anyway that's my final appearance at the wicket". After this the rest of the match was an anticlimax. Neil Harvey was out for 3 and the PM's XI were 123/6 before Richie Benaud (63) and Ken Mackay (49) restored the situation, but David Allen (5/68) took three quick wickets, G. Brown was unable to bat so the PM's XI were out for 250 and the MCC won by 3 runs. Robert Menzies invited both teams to dinner and at the end of his speech presented a delighted Fred Trueman with a silver tankard as a birthday present from the Australian people. The Duke joked to the Prime Minister [...] "I suppose you know you've just destroyed the disciplinary labours of several months?" ...|$|E
