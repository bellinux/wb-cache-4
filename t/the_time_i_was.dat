He used {{to take me to}} see cowboy movies all the time when I was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E
25|$|While {{promoting}} the band's 2013 box set, Sound System, which Jones says {{will be the}} final time he works on Clash music, he discussed the band reuniting prior to Strummer's death.There were a few moments at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper Headon, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a performance {{was going to happen}} anyway. I mean, you usually play at that ceremony when you get in. Joe had passed by that point, so we didn't. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do it at the same time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again after the group broke up, and continued that way {{for the rest of the}} time. That was more important to us than the band.|$|E
25|$|The subject {{upon which}} you have written to me {{is one in which}} I {{naturally}} take a more than common interest. Not only was I one of the Oxford Crew in the first Inter-University Boat-Race in 1829, but the Race was entirely set up by me, owing to the fact that though I was myself at Christ Church, Oxford, my home was at Cambridge (my father being Master of Trinity), and I had a large acquaintance there, and some-times (especially in Easter vacations) was invited to pull in one of their boats, e. g. that of St John's, in which were the now Bishops, Selwyn and Tyrrell, and Charles Merivale the historian, all now vigorous and flourishing. I may also mention, as bearing upon your enquiry, that as soon as my father heard that I had been chosen one of the Oxford Eight, and was practising for the Race, he wrote me an earnest letter, in which he desired me not to row any more, simply from anxiety lest my health should suffer. Though I was always much given to athletic exercises, even before I went to Harrow (where I was one of the Eleven in the first Matches against Eton, for four years, 1822 – 1825), my constitution was in some respects rather a delicate one. When I received his letter I went at once to my physician, told him the difficulty in which I was placed, begged him to examine my state of health, and got his authority to assure my father that so far as he could judge, rowing had not done me any harm. By this my father was satisfied, and I was allowed to go on. The Race itself, which was at Henley (two miles up stream), certainly did me no harm, though at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> incommoded by the change to an unusual diet, — under-done beefsteaks, porter, dry bread, no butter, no tea, no vegetables. After the Race, which was on Wednesday or Tuesday (I think), I was able to play cricket, as one of the Eleven also, against Cambridge on the following Friday. The match was at Oxford. We were victorious on both occasions.|$|E

500|$|After his 34th {{birthday}} on August 6, 2003, {{he gave up}} alcohol, caffeine, red meat, {{refined sugar}} and his longtime (sometimes abused) regimen of psychiatric medication.

500|$|Critics {{have noted}} a Stooges {{influence}} in [...] "Touch Me I'm Sick", typical of Mudhoney's early material.

I was {{listening}} to a lot of Irish folk music at the time, so the songs were folky and full of penny whistles and stuff.

[...] She also credits Parish for teaching her how to perform in front of audiences, saying [...] "after the experience with John's band and seeing him perform I found it was enormously helpful to me as a performer to engage with people in the audience, and I probably did learn that from him, amongst other things." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{the first}} time in the Bond series, Fleming {{encountered}} harsh criticism. The most virulent came from Paul Johnson of the New Statesman, who opened his review, [...] "Sex, Snobbery and Sadism", with: [...] "I have just finished what is, without doubt, the nastiest book I have ever read". He went on to say that [...] "by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a third of the way through, I had to suppress a strong impulse to throw the thing away". Although he recognised that Bond represented [...] "a social phenomenon of some importance", he saw this as a negative element, as the phenomenon concerned [...] "three basic ingredients in Dr. No, all unhealthy, all thoroughly English: the sadism of a schoolboy bully, the mechanical, two-dimensional sex-longings of a frustrated adolescent, and the crude, snob-cravings of a suburban adult". Johnson saw no positives in Dr. No, saying that [...] "Mr Fleming has no literary skill, the construction of the book is chaotic, and entire incidents and situations are inserted, and then forgotten, in a haphazard manner." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the prisoners' {{internet}} fame, many visitors come to CPDRC to view the monthly performances held by the convicts. Their presentations are seen from viewing platforms surrounding the exercise yard. At the jail, visitors can have their pictures taken with the inmates. They can also buy souvenir prison shirts. A research student from The Netherlands, Anne Yzerman, attended one of the two-hour shows and praised the convicts. [...] "They are so good at dancing all <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really impressed." [...] The CPDRC inmates dance numbers include a rendition of Bonnie Tyler's [...] "Holding Out for a Hero". The performance involves the inmates holding portraits of figures such as the Dalai Lama, Pope John Paul II and Mahatma Gandhi. After Michael Jackson's death on June 25, 2009, Cebu prison officials announced that the prison inmates would be recreating the Thriller routine on the following Saturday, June 27, 2009. On June 27, 2009, the tribute video was uploaded with a dance routine for [...] "Ben", [...] "I'll Be There", and [...] "We Are the World".|$|E
500|$|To {{create the}} Mummy, Berton used a {{combination}} of live action and computer graphics. Then, he matched the digital prosthetic make-up pieces on Vosloo's face during filming. Berton said, [...] "When you see his film image, that's him. When he turns his head and half of his face is missing {{and you can see}} right through on to his teeth, that's really his face. And that's why it was so hard to do." [...] Vosloo described the filming as a [...] "whole new thing" [...] for him; [...] "They had to put these little red tracking lights all over my face so they could map in the special effects. A lot of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> walking around the set looking like a Christmas tree." [...] Make-Up Effects Supervisor Nick Dudman produced the physical creature effects in the film, including three-dimensional make-up and prosthetics. He also designed all of the animatronic effects. While the film made extensive use of computer generated imagery, many scenes, including ones where Rachel Weisz's character is covered with rats and locusts, were real, using live animals.|$|E

500|$|Some reviewers {{noted that}} Half-Blood Prince {{contained}} a darker tone {{than the previous}} Potter novels. The Christian Science Monitor reviewer Yvonne Zipp considered the first half to contain a lighter tone to soften the unhappy ending. The Boston Globe reviewer Liz Rosenberg wrote, [...] "lightness [...] slimmer than ever in this darkening series... a new charge of gloom and darkness. I felt depressed by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{two-thirds of the way}} through". She also compared the setting to Charles Dickens's depictions of London, as it was [...] "brooding, broken, gold-lit, as living character as any other". Christopher Paolini called the darker tone [...] "disquieting" [...] because it was so different from the earlier books. Liesl Schillinger, a contributor to The New York Times book review, also noted that Half-Blood Prince was [...] "far darker" [...] but [...] "leavened with humor, romance and snappy dialogue". She suggested a connection to the 11 September attacks, as the later, darker novels were written after that event. David Kipen, a critic of the San Francisco Chronicle considered the [...] "darkness as a sign of our paranoid times" [...] and singled out curfews and searches that were part of the tightened security at Hogwarts, as a resemblance to our world.|$|E
500|$|Di Grassi {{was handed}} a formal {{reprimand}} by the stewards over the pit stop release that caused Piquet to brake to avoid hitting {{him and was}} fined €1,500. Piquet felt it was not fair for different punishments to exist for the same penalty and was frustrated, complaining of inconsistency from the stewards. He warned drivers would become quickly disenchanted and believed stewards would not be taken seriously in future races. Piquet advocated for more people to observe the track, install more cameras and fit a GPS system in all cars. D'Ambrosio felt aggrieved over the battle between his teammate Duval in the race's closing period, saying the events were [...] "a {{little bit of a}} pity" [...] and was unsure whether it was a misunderstanding. Duval insisted the battle was firm but fair, saying he gave d'Ambrosio room but would make it difficult for anyone to overtake him: [...] "As you have seen in the past though we have had fights and most of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really gentle, and this weekend I was in this position where I was competitive and I had less energy available so I fought." [...] Dragon's team principal Jay Penske revealed the drivers were allowed to battle each other cleanly but if one of them eliminated the other from contention, that driver would be required to miss the following race.|$|E

500|$|Frusciante {{developed}} serious drug habits while touring {{with the}} band during the previous four years. He {{said that when he}} [...] "found out that Flea was stoned out of his mind at every show, that inspired me to be a pothead". Not only was Frusciante smoking large amounts of marijuana, but he began to use heroin and {{was on the verge of}} full-scale addiction. Upon returning to California in the summer of 1992, Frusciante entered a deep depression, feeling that his life was over and that he could no longer write music or play guitar. For a long time, he focused on painting, producing 4-track recordings he had made while working on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, and writing short stories and screenplays. To cope with his worsening depression, Frusciante increased his heroin use and spiraled into a life-threatening dependency. His use of heroin to medicate his depression was a clear decision: [...] "I was very sad, and I was always happy when I was on drugs; therefore, I should be on drugs all <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> never guilty—I was always really proud to be an addict." [...] Frusciante openly admitted to being a [...] "junkie", believing that drugs were the only way of [...] "making sure you stay in touch with beauty instead of letting the ugliness of the world corrupt your soul." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 1991 Canadian {{television}} interview, Love {{commented on}} the album's coarse musical structure. She said that since the band was from Los Angeles, the [...] "metal capital of the US", {{they thought they were}} making a [...] "pop record with an edge", and were surprised by people's reactions when they were told it was violent and extreme. Love also said, [...] "It was all about the expression of my experience. I was not coming from a black void; I was trying to create light... I was trying to heal." [...] In an interview with Spin magazine several years after its release, Love said that she was [...] "posing in a lot of ways" [...] with the album: [...] "It was the truth, but it was also me catching up with all my hip peers who'd gone all indie on me, and who made fun of me for liking R.E.M. and The Smiths. I'd done the whole punk thing, sleeping on floors in piss and beer, and waking up with the guy with the fucking mohawk and the skateboards and the speed and the whole goddamned thing. But I hated it. I'd grown out of it by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> seventeen." [...] In a 1994 interview with Kurt Loder, Love admitted to having been [...] "consciously self-conscious" [...] when making the record due to her feeling the need to compete with her peers at the time.|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} five books (Casino Royale, Live and Let Die, Moonraker, Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia, with Love) Fleming {{received}} broadly positive reviews. That began to change in March 1958 when Bernard Bergonzi, in the journal Twentieth Century, attacked Fleming's work as containing [...] "a strongly marked streak of voyeurism and sado-masochism" [...] and wrote that the books showed [...] "the total lack of any ethical frame of reference". The article compared Fleming unfavourably with John Buchan and Raymond Chandler on both moral and literary criteria. A month later, Dr. No was published, and Fleming received harsh criticism {{from a number of}} reviewers who, in the words of Ben Macintyre, [...] "rounded on Fleming, almost as a pack". The most strongly worded of the critiques came from Paul Johnson of the New Statesman, who, in his review [...] "Sex, Snobbery and Sadism", called the novel [...] "without doubt, the nastiest book I have ever read". Johnson {{went on to say that}} [...] "by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a third of the way through, I had to suppress a strong impulse to throw the thing away".
