[...] Lorde explained the song's lyrical meaning to New York magazine, [...] "'The Love Club' {{is about an}} experience I had {{about a year ago}} where I met all these new friends and I fell in with them. It happened overnight and I couldn't think of anything but our friends and our situation. Then I started <b>to</b> <b>maybe</b> realise that group wasn't so good for me, and that my old friends and my family are the people I should be with. It's about being drawn into this crazy world, and you’re all in love".|$|E

Rehman pointed to Michael Chopra and David Nugent, who both were top scorer in the Championship, but Nugent was called up for England while Chopra was not. Rehman claimed [...] "Why wasn't (Chopra) picked ahead of Dave Nugent? He's the top goal scorer in the Championship but he can't get in (the England set-up). So he needs <b>to</b> <b>maybe</b> look at his decision and go play for India instead of hanging on to the dream of playing for England, because it's not going to happen, end of discussion." ...|$|E
500|$|Maybe This Christmas is {{a holiday}} {{compilation}} album released in November 2002 through Nettwerk Records featuring contemporary musicians performing both classic and original Christmas songs. The album, named by Ron Sexsmith, {{is the first}} in a series of three holiday compilations released through the record label between 2002 and 2004. A portion of the proceeds from the sales of each album went to Toys for Tots, a charity supported by the United States Marine Corps. Most of the tracks exclusive <b>to</b> <b>Maybe</b> This Christmas were recorded just a few months prior to its release. The album's cover art was designed by artist Paul Frank, creator of Julius the pictured [...] "wide-mouth monkey". Critical reception of the compilation was mixed, with reviewers often complimenting or criticizing select tracks. In the United States, the album reached a peak position of number thirty-eight on Billboard Top Holiday Albums chart.|$|E

Max Martin, who produced Spears' debut single [...] "...Baby One More Time", produced [...] "If U Seek Amy" [...] for the album. The Outsyders, an Atlanta-based production team, produced the album's first single, while Fernando Garibay worked on two bonus songs for Spears. Danja reported that he worked on the tracks at Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles, and Spears recorded them at Glenwood Place Studios in Burbank; the Canadian trio Let's Go to War co-wrote and produced the track [...] "Mmm Papi". Lil Jon, Rodney Jerkins, Sean Garrett, and Taio Cruz announced they were working with Spears, though their songs weren't included on the official track listing.|$|E

Buonopane, Jackson, Parnell, and Shepherd made their fifth, eighth, sixteenth, and sixth appearances on the show, respectively. In an interview with TV Guide in November 2010, co-showrunner and executive producer Robert Carlock revealed that Shepherd's character [...] "will be getting her own Real Housewives-type reality show. Having the cameras around forces Tracy to act on better behavior." [...] This {{is evident in the}} following episode [...] "Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning". Tina Fey, the series creator, executive producer and lead actress on 30 Rock, told Entertainment Weekly, in regards to Angie's reality show, [...] "We're hoping <b>to,</b> <b>maybe,</b> if we can get away with it, do an entire episode that's just an episode of Queen of Jordan. Now I'm just superimposing my own TV viewing habits onto 30 Rock." [...] In the episode, Dr. Spaceman informs Tracy Jordan—played by Tracy Morgan—that he is dying, television columnist Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times wondered if this subplot was written as {{a way to deal with}} Tracy Morgan's recent kidney transplant as he is expected to miss several episodes to recover from the procedure.|$|E
500|$|Coach McKay had {{won four}} {{national}} championships while coaching at USC, {{and he never}} hesitated to express his lack of awe at the NFL. He earned enemies in the league with his dismissive comments and nonchalant attitude. The league liked to promote the games as having life-or-death significance, and were undercut by a coach who would make statements such as, “You draw Xs and Os on a blackboard and that’s not so difficult. I can even do it with my left hand”. Such statements made the Buccaneers’ road more difficult, as a feeling grew around the league that McKay was a newcomer who needed to be taught a lesson. Linebacker Richard “Batman” Wood echoed those sentiments: “It was a brand-new organization. Who cared about us? They wanted to devastate us, beat us in the ground. And with coach McKay coming from college, they wanted <b>to</b> <b>maybe</b> even play us a little harder." [...] Examples given of opponents using McKay’s comments {{as an excuse to}} run up the score included the reverse that Denver ran late in a 48–10 victory, and the timeout that Chuck Fairbanks called {{at the end of the}} Patriots game to enable Steve Grogan to break the NFL record of season rushing touchdowns by a quarterback. One sports analyst had predicted that McKay’s lucrative contract would encourage opposing coaches to run up the score on the Buccaneers, to be able to demonstrate to their team owners that they were deserving of similar money.|$|E

He has a disregard for hurdles, he just wants to go. Fences might make him respect things more".|$|E

He suggested the band could return to the recording studio as soon as October 2016. Weezer delayed recording after Cuomo felt his new material was more [...] "like reveries from a beach {{at the end of the}} world [...] the Beach Boys and the Clash fell in love by the ocean and had one hell of an amazing baby".|$|E

2500|$|In May 2012, several U.S. owners {{reported}} seeing only 11 of 12 battery capacity {{bars on the}} in-car display which led them to believe they had lost some battery capacity. As time went on, more people {{reported seeing}} the issue, and some had lost two, three, and even in rare cases, four battery capacity bars. The battery capacity loss problem seems to be concentrated in regions with hot climate, and Phoenix, Arizona {{and the state of}} Texas in particular. In July 2012, Nissan responded by saying they were investigating the issue, and a carmaker spokesman also said that [...] "the problem is isolated <b>to</b> <b>maybe</b> 0.3 percent of the 13,000 Leafs on U.S. roads, and the company reportedly has loaned cars to some Leaf owners in Arizona as it researches the issue."

2500|$|The third amber piece {{described}} was JZC Bu1645, {{which has}} three distinct flow layers preserved, dating from several hours <b>to</b> <b>maybe</b> days between flow events. Layer {{one is the}} smallest and top most, while layer three is the bottom most and largest. The presence of sand and humus particles along with a several entombed immature arthropods in the flows indicates the resin pooled {{on or near the}} forest floor. [...] In total there are over twenty other arthropods and twenty-one ants preserved with the highest Gerontoformica diversity of the described amber specimens. [...] At least three different species are present in the amber, G. contegus, G. orientalis, and G. robustus, and the workers are in three distinct groups in the layers. [...] The layer one has a grouping of seven ants, layer two a grouping of three ants, and layer three a grouping of eleven ants. [...] The largest group of ants show some directional orientation, with six of the workers facing essentially the same direction, but the other five show no direction.|$|E
2500|$|Guitarist Michael Einziger {{noted that}} his {{contributions}} to the album were influenced by his musical studies during the band's hiatus: [...] "Maybe my desire to return to simplicity, or even to just go to simplicity - because I've never really written music that simple before — {{is sort of a}} response <b>to</b> <b>maybe</b> having a better or larger perspective of the overall musical landscape that I’ve never had before." [...] Einziger elaborated further, [...] "Over the years, we've become less and less aggressive as far as our music goes. There's always moments of that aggression, but this album is pretty free of that. It's definitely not a hard rock record. I think we're asking a lot of our fans. We're asking them to listen for things that they normally wouldn't listen for. We're not leaning on the strengths of our last records either. It's that much different than our previous work. I think we took a risk by making this type of album. But it's not some crazy, experimental album." [...] Vocalist Brandon Boyd cited Einziger as a key reason for the band's new direction, noting [...] "Michael really buckled down and studied musical composition that inspired him to reach out and dig into different places that he never has before." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Republicans in the Minnesota House {{dismissed}} {{the idea of}} speech being an ethics violation, maintaining “Lindner's comments were offensive, but Lindner {{has the right to}} say them.” Republican House Speaker Steve Sviggum pointed out that [...] "House Republicans didn't complain when Rep. Tom Rukavina, DFL-Virginia, called State Auditor Pat Awada, 'Osama Bin Awada'" [...] when Awada proposed to curb local government aid. Sviggum said [...] "everyone is entitled to First Amendment rights. 'At some point or another people have freedom of speech even though that speech may not be appropriate, politically correct or even the most wise speech.'" [...] Sviggum said [...] "I don't think that we want to take this to the ultimate end and put that chilling effect upon speech, upon feeling, upon values and principals that one has or doesn't have in this entire process." [...] Lindner also invoked freedom of speech, saying [...] "I still believe in the First Amendment -- that we're allowed to express our views and so forth -- and it's getting close <b>to</b> <b>maybe</b> not being able to do that, but while we can, I'm doing it." [...] In their rebuttal the House Republicans also played a recording of Ellison’s interview with a radio station. In the interview Ellison had said “People should feel free to express themselves as long as they don’t violate the law. ...I would never invoke the powers of the state to restrict Arlon Lindner from expressing himself.” ...|$|E

In singles, Björkman won six career titles, and went as high as the 4th place in the rankings, in 1997, reaching two Grand Slam semifinals at the 1997 US Open (lost to Rusedski), and at the 2006 Wimbledon Championships (lost to Federer). A former World No. 1 in doubles, Björkman won fifty-four career doubles titles, including nine Grand Slam crowns (runner-up at six more). [...] He was one of four active doubles players at the time of the Masters Cup to have completed a career Grand Slam (with Bob and Mike Bryan, and Daniel Nestor), and two year-end championships titles, in 1994 and 2006. Björkman, who mainly partnered during his career with Jan Apell, Nicklas Kulti, Todd Woodbridge, Max Mirnyi and Kevin Ullyett, also finished runner-up at two mixed doubles Grand Slam finals at Wimbledon, with Anna Kournikova in 1999, and Alicia Molik in 2007, and was part of the Sweden Davis Cup team for their last three championships in 1994, 1997 and 1998. Upon retirement, as a ceremony was taking place for him, following his loss to Fyrstenberg and Matkowski, Björkman declared: [...] "We were hoping <b>to</b> <b>maybe</b> get through [...] I still think it's great to end my career in the biggest event of the year. But you can't get everything. I've been mentally prepared for this because I'm mentally very ready to retire. [...] I've been very fortunate to be able to play for so long.
