5|$|Despite {{the recent}} successes in Cincinnati, the captive-breeding program has {{remained}} controversial.

Opponents of the captive breeding program argue that the losses are too great; the program is too expensive; removing rhinos from their habitat, even temporarily, alters their ecological role; and captive populations cannot match the rate of recovery seen in well-protected native habitats.

5|$|Judging {{that both}} {{national}} governments and global institutions have proven ineffective in addressing worldwide problems {{that go beyond}} the capacity of individual nation-states to solve, some political scientists critical of New World Order conspiracism, such as Mark C.

As such, the E.U., the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the G-20 will likely become more influential as time progresses.
