5000|$|Schönemann {{argued for}} the non-existence of psychometric g. He wrote {{that there is a}} {{fundamental}} difference between g, first defined by Charles Spearman as a latent one-dimensional variable that accounts for all correlations among any intelligence tests, and a first principal component (PC1) of a positive correlation matrix. Spearman's <b>tetrad</b> <b>difference</b> equation states a necessary condition for such a g to exist. The important proviso for Spearman's claim that such a g qualifies as an [...] "objective definition" [...] of [...] "intelligence", is that all correlation matrices of [...] "intelligence tests" [...] must satisfy this necessary condition, not just one or two, because they are all samples of a universe of tests subject to the same g. Schönemannargued that this condition is routinely violated by all correlation matrices of reasonable size, and thus, such a g does not exist.|$|E

30|$|Considers minimising the <b>TETRAD</b> <b>differences</b> by T_e^(ijkl) {{subject to}} the {{constraints}} by Eq. (5) may motivate a new road for learning a causal model from samples to approximate tree decomposable causality. Instead of making tests based {{on the set of}} correlation coefficients between observable variables, as typically made in the existing procedure, we first perform the optimisation by Eq. (13) to estimate another set of correlation coefficients between observable variables and latent variables, and then make tests based on both the sets. We may further proceed along this road to make block star-causality analysis on factor analysis and block tree decomposable analysis on linear causal model.|$|R

This note simplifies their proof and generalizes the theorem. In {{order to make the}} ideas as accessible as possible to mathematicians who might develop them further, we begin with a thorough exposition of their purely graphtheoretical aspects. Part I. Treks and Choke Points in a Directed Acyclic Graph We assume that the reader is familiar with the most basic definitions of graph theory. Recall that a graph is an object consisting of nodes and edges between them. It is directed if its edges are directed (marked with arrows). We assume that we are working with a finite directed graph, in which edges are always between distinct nodes and there is at most one edge between any pair of distinct nodes. We use the usual definitions of parent, child, descendant, and ancestor; if there is an edge between X and Y with its arrowing pointing from X to Y, we say that X is a parent of Y and Y is a child of X. We call a node exogenous if it has no parents, endogeneous if it does have parents, and barre...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} deals with G-quadruplexes formed by folding {{of the human}} {{telomeric}} sequence d(GGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGG), in presence of K+ cations, noted Tel 21 /K+. Fluorescence decays and fluorescence anisotropy decays, obtained upon excitation at 267 nm, are probed from femtosecond to nanosecond domains using two different detection techniques, fluorescence upconversion and time-correlated single photon counting. The results are discussed {{in light of recent}} theoretical studies. It is shown that efficient energy transfer takes place among the bases on the femtosecond time scale, possible only via exciton states. The major part of the fluorescence originates from bright excited states having weak charge transfer character and decaying between 1 and 100 ps. Charge transfer states involving guanines in different tetrads decay mainly after 100 ps and emit at the red wing of the spectrum. The persistence of electronic excitations in Tel 21 /K+ is longer and the contribution of charge transfer states is more pronounced than what is observed for G-quadruplexes formed by association of four d(TGGGT) strands and containing the same number of <b>tetrads.</b> This <b>difference</b> is due to the increased structural rigidity of monomolecular structures which reduces nonradiative deactivation pathways and favors collective effects...|$|R
40|$|Non-disjoined {{chromosomes}} 15 from 115 {{cases of}} uniparental disomy (ascertained through Prader-Willi syndrome) and 13 cases of trisomy of maternal origin were densely typed for microsatellite loci spanning chromosome 15 q. Of these 128 cases {{a total of}} 97 meiosis I (MI) errors, 19 meiosis II (MII) errors and 12 mitotic errors were identified. The genetic length of a map created from the MI errors was 101 cM, as compared with a maternal length of 137 cM based on CEPH controls. No significant differences were detected {{in the distribution of}} recombination events along the chromosome arm and a reduction was seen for most of the chromosome 15 intervals examined. It was estimated that 21 % of tetrads leading to MI non-disjunction were achiasmate, which may account for most or all of the reduction in recombination noted. The mean age of mothers of cases involving MI errors which showed no transitions from heterodisomy to isodisomy was significantly lower (32. 7) than cases showing one or more observable transitions (36. 3) (P < 0. 003, t-test). However, even among chiasmate pairs the highest mean maternal age was seen for multiple exchange <b>tetrads.</b> Chromosome-specific <b>differences</b> in maternal age effects {{may be related to the}} normal distribution of exchanges (and their individual susceptibilities) for each chromosome. However, they may also reflect the presence of multiple factors which act to ensure normal segregation, each affected by maternal age in a different way and varying in importance for each chromosom...|$|R
40|$|Some F-rich {{granitic}} rocks show anomalous, nonchondritic {{ratios of}} Y/Ho, extreme negative Eu anomalies, and unusual, discontinuous, segmented clrondrite-normalised plots of {{rare earth elements}} (REE). The effects of F-rich fluids have been proposed {{as one of the}} explanations for the geochemical anomalies in the evolved granitic systems, as the stability of nonsilicate complexes of individual rare earths may affect the fluid-melt element partitioning. The lanthanide tetrad effect, related to different configurations of 4 f-electron subshells of the lanthanide elements, is one of the factors affecting such complexing behaviour. We present the first experimental demonstration of the decoupling of Y and Ho, and the tetrad effect in the partitioning of rare earths between immiscible silicate and fluoride melts. Two types of experiments were performed: dry runs at atmospheric pressure in a high-temperature centrifuge at 1100 to 1200 degrees C, and experiments with the addition of H 2 O at 700 to 800 degrees C and 100 MPa in rapid-quench cold-seal pressure vessels. Run products were analysed by electron microprobe (major components), solution-based inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (REE in the centrifuged runs), and laser ablation ICP-MS (REE and Li in the products of rapid-quench runs). All the dry centrifuge runs were performed at super-liquidus, two-phase conditions. In the experiments with water-bearing mixtures, minor amounts of aqueous vapour were present in addition to the melts. We found that lanthanides and Y concentrated strongly in the fluoride liquids, with two-melt partition coefficients reaching values as high as 100 - 220 in water-bearing compositions. In all the experimental samples, two-melt partition coefficients of lanthanides show subtle periodicity consistent with the tetrad effect, and the partition coefficient of Y is greater than that of Ho. One of the mixtures also produced abundant fluorite (CaF 2) and cryolite (Na 3 AlF 6) crystals, which enabled us to study fluorite-melt and cryolite-melt REE partitioning. REE concentrations in fluorite are high and comparable to those in the fluoride melt. However, fluorite-melt partition coefficients appear to depend mostly on ionic radii and show neither significant <b>tetrad</b> anomalies, nor <b>differences</b> in Y and Ho partitioning. In contrast, REE concentrations in cryolite are low (similar to 5 - 10 times lower than in the silicate melt), and cryolite-melt REE partitioning shows very strong tetrad and Y-Ho anomalies. Our results imply that Y-Ho and lanthanide tetrad anomalies are likely to be caused mainly by aluminofluoride complexes, and the tetrad REE patterns in natural igneous rocks can result from fractionation of F-rich magmatic fluids...|$|R
