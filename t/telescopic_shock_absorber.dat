5000|$|During the 1960s, {{the lever}} arm was {{replaced}} by the <b>telescopic</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber.</b> This was encouraged by better roads and motorways, increasing average speeds and driver expectations of handling. The <b>telescopic</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> dissipated heat more effectively, owing to its larger working volume of fluid and also the better ratio of surface area to fluid volume.|$|E
5000|$|The {{tool and}} chain {{manufacturers}} Abingdon Engineering {{was founded in}} 1856 and started making motorcycles in 1903, when the industry was still very new, with engines {{from a number of}} manufacturers before the company developed their own Abingdon four-stroke 350 cc single and 794 cc V-twin engines, which were used by Ariel and Invicta. Much of the production was exported to the Commonwealth countries. One innovation introduced by Abingdon was the first <b>telescopic</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber.</b> Motorcycles of the day often had no front suspension or some form of springs, but Abingdon devised the [...] "Abingdon Spring Fork", a coil sprung, <b>telescopic</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The 48-215 was {{the first}} model from General Motors in Australia to bear the Holden name. In {{mainstream}} parlance, the official name of [...] "Holden 48-215" [...] was eschewed in favour of the shortened [...] "Holden" [...] designation. Following {{the replacement of the}} first Holden, the 48-215 gained the unofficial nickname of Holden FX. This designation was first used in the Drawing Office at GM-H in 1952 as an unofficial means of distinguishing between early 48-215 vehicles with front suspension using lever-action shock absorbers, and those with the new <b>telescopic</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> front suspension introduced in 1953 - the term [...] "FX" [...] was pencilled onto a parts list for the new suspension components. The title [...] "FX" [...] later came into use in used car advertisements to describe models with the later suspension, first being used by Melbourne dealer Reg Smith Motors in two advertisements in the 10 February 1960 issue of The Age. Use of the term [...] "FX" [...] gradually spread to cover all 48-215 and 50-2016 vehicles, although the term has never been used by Holden in any official manner.|$|E
5000|$|The Marine Multi-purpose Vehicle {{is built}} around a tubular-steel frame safety roll-cage which protects the {{passenger}} compartment if the vehicle turns over. This cage is covered by a heavy-gauge sheet metal. An electrical winch with a capacity of 5000 kg can be mounted {{at the front of}} the vehicle if required, and the windshield can be removed. The passenger compartment is in the center of the vehicle with the driver on the left and two passenger seats to his right. There is space for [...] of cargo behind the passenger seats. A full length skid pan protects the hull and allows the vehicle to slide over obstacles. The transmission is a Mitsubishi A-727 fully automatic with a torque converter, there are 3F and 1R gears - the Marine Multi-purpose Vehicle is in 4 x 4 drive all the time. Limited-slip clutches, in front and rear, and inter-axle differentials automatically distribute more torque to those wheels with the most grip. The independent suspension is of a double 'A' design with a torsion-bar spring and hydraulic <b>telescopic</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> at each station.

The glass halves are stored in a mounting bracket on the hood until needed again. The passenger compartment is in the center of the vehicle with the driver on the left and the passenger seat to the right. There is space for [...] of cargo behind the passenger seats. The engine and transmission are at the rear of the hull and there is an external load-carrying platform above this which can take a maximum load of 386 kg. The minimum ground clearance is 11 inches, and a full length skid pan protects the hull and drivetrain, which allows the vehicle to slide over obstacles. The transmission is a Chrysler A-727 [...] "TorqueFlite" [...] torque converter automatic, with three forward and one reverse gears. The XR311 is a full-time 4WD vehicle. [...] "Trak-lok" [...] limited-slip differentials with a 5.89:1 drive ratio are used front and rear, and a lockable center differential ensures traction to all wheels. The fully independent suspension uses modified Dana 44 centersections, and used many off the shelf parts from the front wheel drive Oldsmobile Toronado / Cadillac Eldorado (e.g., CV joints and boots, spindle and bearings, and 11 inch disk brakes), and is of a double-wishbone design with a torsion-bar spring and hydraulic <b>telescopic</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> at each station. A stabilizer baris provided for the rear suspension to limit body roll. Maximum speed is 80-90 mph for vehicles with the 318ci engine, dropping to 67 mph at full load.
