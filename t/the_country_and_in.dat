5|$|In the 17thcentury, Aarhus {{entered a}} period of {{recession}} as it suffered blockades and bombardments during the Swedish wars and trade was dampened by the preferential treatment of the capital by the state. It {{was not until the}} middle of the 18thcentury growth returned in large part due to trade with the large agricultural catchment areas around the city; particularly grain proved to be a remunerative export. The first factories were established at this time as the industrial revolution reached <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> 1810 the harbour was expanded to accommodate growing trade.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the Free Belgian forces {{continue}} to be celebrated within Belgium. The Belgian Marine Component, for example, still operates a ship named Godetia. There are numerous memorials to {{the participation of the}} Free Belgians forces in the liberation across <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> areas liberated by the Free Belgians. The participation of soldiers from the Belgian Congo was, however, largely forgotten following Congolese independence in 1960 and decades of subsequent war, though in recent years the profile of the veterans has been raised by exhibitions creating greater public awareness.|$|E

5|$|After Burger King Corporation {{lost the}} case, {{it decided to}} {{terminate}} its operations in <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> July 2002, the company transferred its assets to its New Zealand franchise group, Trans-Pacific Foods (TPF). The terms of the sale had TPF assume oversight of the Burger King franchises {{in the region as}} the Burger King brand's master franchisee. Trans-Pacific Foods administered the chain's 81 locations until September 2003 when the new management team of Burger King Corporation reached an agreement with Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd to re-brand the existing Burger King locations to Hungry Jack's and make HJP the sole master franchisee of both brands. An additional part of the agreement required Burger King Corporation to provide administrative and advertising support as to insure a common marketing scheme for the company and its products. Trans-Pacific Foods transferred its control of the Burger King franchises to Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd, which subsequently renamed the remaining Burger King locations as Hungry Jack's.|$|E
5|$|Jadid's {{government}} {{has been referred to}} as Syria's most radical government in history. He initiated rash and radical policies internally and externally, and tried to overturn Syrian society from the top to the bottom. While Assad and Jadid agreed ideologically, they did not agree on how to implement these beliefs in practice. The Military Committee, which had been the officers' key decision-making process during 1963–66, lost its central institutional authority under Jadid because the fight against the Aflaqites was over – the key reason for the committee's existence in the first place. While Jadid never acquired, or took the offices of Prime Minister or President, instead opting to rule through the office of Assistant Secretary of the Regional Command, he was the undisputed ruler of Syria from 1966 to 1970. Before the 1966 coup, Jadid had controlled the Syrian armed forces through his post as Head of the Bureau of Officers' Affairs, but from 1966 onwards Jadid became absorbed with running <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> his place, Assad was given the task of controlling the armed forces. This would later prove to be a mistake, and lead to Jadid's downfall in the 1970 Corrective Revolution.|$|E

5|$|McGovern did not mourn {{leaving the}} Senate. Although being {{rejected}} {{by his own}} state stung, intellectually he could accept that South Dakotans wanted a more conservative representative; he and Eleanor felt {{out of touch with}} <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> some ways liberated by the loss. Nevertheless, he refused to believe that American liberalism was dead in the time of Reagan; remaining active in politics, in January 1981 he founded the political organization Americans for Common Sense. The group sought to rally liberals, encourage liberal thinking, and combat the Moral Majority and other new Christian right forces. In 1982, he turned the group into a political action committee, which raised $1.2 million for liberal candidates in the 1982 U.S. Congressional elections. McGovern shut the committee down when he decided to run for president again.|$|E
5|$|Pregame {{media and}} fan {{interest}} surrounding the game focused largely on Louisville's top-ranked offense and Virginia Tech's first-ranked scoring defense. Other major points of media coverage included the two teams' quarterbacks: Louisville's Hunter Cantwell, who replaced starter Brian Brohm after Brohm suffered a season-ending knee injury; and Virginia Tech's Marcus Vick, brother of National Football League star Michael Vick. Also {{a concern for}} Louisville was the health of star running back Michael Bush, who missed two games in November due to an injury. On a wider note, there was also interest in the conference-level showdown between a new Big East team (Louisville) and a team that left the Big East for the ACC after the 2003 season (Virginia Tech). For Virginia Tech, {{there was also the}} hope of overcoming the disappointment of a season that saw the Hokies ranked third in <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> the hunt for the national championship before failing to even win the Atlantic Coast Conference and missing a bid to a Bowl Championship Series game.|$|E
5|$|Taking up his {{part-time}} professorship at the Institute of Archaeology, {{he began}} to lecture to students almost every day. There, he found that he developed a relationship of mutual respect with the director, Childe, despite their strong personal and professional differences. In April 1949, after the retirement of Cyril Fox, Wheeler was nominated for the Presidency of the Society of Antiquaries, but lost to James Mann; many archaeologists, including Childe and O. G. S. Crawford, resigned from the Society in protest, deeming Wheeler {{to have been a}} far more appropriate candidate for the position. Wheeler was nevertheless elected director of the Society. In 1950 he was awarded the Petrie Medal, and in 1952 was knighted. That same year he was invited to give the Norton lectures for the Archaeological Institute of America, and while in the United States was also awarded the Lucy Wharton Drexel medal at Pennsylvania. He nevertheless disliked <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> later life exhibited anti-Americanism.|$|E

5|$|The King's {{capitulation}} {{was a hard}} {{blow for}} Kościuszko, who had not lost a single battle in the campaign. By mid-September 1792 he was resigned to leaving <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> early October he departed from Warsaw. First he went east, to the Czartoryski family manor at Sieniawa, which gathered various malcontents. In mid-November he spent two weeks in Lwów (in Ukrainian, Lviv; in German, Lemberg), where he was welcomed by the populace; since the war's end, his presence had drawn crowds eager to see the famed commander. Izabela Czartoryska discussed having him marry her daughter Zofia. The Russians planned to arrest him if he returned to territory under their control; the Austrians, who held Lwów, offered him a commission in the Austrian Army, which he turned down. Subsequently they planned to deport him, but he left Lwów before they could do so. At {{the turn of the}} month, he stopped in Zamość at the Zamoyskis' estate, met Stanisław Staszic, then went on to Puławy.|$|E
