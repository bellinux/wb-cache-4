5|$|In 2011, Barlow won an All About Soap {{award for}} Rae's love-triangle storyline. AfterElton criticised {{the lack of}} {{character}} development Rae received, and along with the Sunday Mercury, bemoaned the dearth of realism exhibited in Rae staying with Ste despite knowing that he was homosexual. Readers of the soap opera magazine Inside Soap indicated that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> Silas to murder Rae.|$|E
5|$|The Achaean League {{was upset}} {{that one of}} its members had {{remained}} under Spartan occupation and persuaded the Romans to revisit their decision to leave Sparta's territorial gains intact. The Romans agreed with the Achaeans, as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> a strong and re-organized Sparta causing trouble after the Romans left Greece.|$|E
50|$|Some {{adolescent}} girls bind their breasts {{as they enter}} puberty. This is done usually for reasons of modesty (<b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> others to see them), embarrassment (<b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> others to know they have started developing), or desire to be as they previously were (<b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to have breasts yet). This has potential risks, as the developing tissue may conform to the restricted shape, resulting in permanent deformity. Breast binding in {{adolescent girls}} may be a symptom of body dysmorphic disorder.|$|R

5|$|In {{the band}}'s fourth album, 2011's The Here and Now, the band {{set out to}} mix their typical sounds with the music they were {{listening}} to at the time. The response was polarising. During the publicity for The Here and Now, the band praised it as a progression for them; <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to reject an album they had just released. But their own lack of belief in the record and their growing concern that they were irrelevant started to severely affect the band's confidence in themselves and their style.|$|E
5|$|On August 15, 2011, {{there was}} more {{disruption}} in service at BART stations in downtown San Francisco. The San Francisco Examiner reported that the protests were {{a result of the}} shootings, including that of Oscar Grant. Demonstrations were announced by several activists, which eventually resulted in disruptions to service. The protesters have stated that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> their protests to results in closures, and accused the BART police of using the protests as an excuse for disruption. Protesters vowed to continue their protests every Monday until their demands were met.|$|E
5|$|The first {{discussion}} of a bridge in a public forum was in 1954, when Anton P. Torsvik proposed a bridge to the major and municipal engineer of Fjell. Torsvik lived in Oslo and had worked with public relations for various other bridge projects. The issue was discussed in the municipal councils of Fjell and Sund, but they both concluded {{that there were more}} pressing needs on the islands' road network, so <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to prioritize a bridge. National Road 555 was completed in 1957, and the following years various road projects were completed.|$|E

5|$|Weisberger {{is widely}} {{believed}} to have based Miranda on Anna Wintour, the powerful editor of Vogue. Wintour reportedly warned major fashion designers who {{had been invited to}} make cameo appearances as themselves in the film that they would be banished from the magazine's pages if they did so. Vogue and other major women's and fashion magazines have avoided reviewing or even mentioning the book in their pages. Wintour's spokespeople deny the claim, but costume designer Patricia Field says many designers told her <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to risk Wintour's wrath.|$|E
5|$|After a long {{discussion}} {{about how the}} episode should end, the writers decided that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> Barney to return to being drunk {{at the end of}} the episode. Barney stayed sober for several seasons. The animators modified the appearance of the character, straightening his hair, among other things, to indicate his sobriety. Castellaneta altered his voice for the character by no longer slurring. Barney was still seen at Moe's Tavern, but only drinking lattes. The character's new addiction to coffee was suggested by writer-producer David Mirkin, who has friends who stopped drinking alcohol and became addicted to coffee.|$|E
5|$|Aliens do not {{feature in}} the series, as Grant and Naylor decided {{very early in the}} process that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> aliens involved. This is usually {{addressed}} with Rimmer's belief in extraterrestrial life being shot down, such as a vessel he believes to be an alien ship turning out to be a garbage pod. However, there are non-human life forms such as evolutions of Earth species (e.g. the Cat race), robotic or holo-life forms created by humans, and a kind of 'Genetically Engineered Life Form' (GELF), an artificially-created creature. Simulants and GELFs frequently serve as antagonists among the later series of the show.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the American Kennel Club {{explored}} {{the possibility of}} recognising the Jack Russell terrier. This move was opposed by the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> the breed to lose its essential working characteristics. The Jack Russell Terrier Breeders Association formed and petitioned the AKC; the breed's admission was granted in 2001. Under the AKC recognised standard, {{the size of the}} breed was narrowed from the previous club's standard, {{and the name of the}} AKC recognised Jack Russell terrier was changed to Parson Russell terrier, with the Jack Russell Terrier Breeders Association renamed to the Parson Russell Terrier Association of America.|$|E
5|$|Mike B. Anderson {{stated that}} at least three {{different}} acts of material were written and animated for Krusty's comeback stand-up appearance at Moe's Tavern. It {{was not until the}} editing process that the material used was decided upon. The episode was still being animated three weeks before it was due to air and the production process moved frantically shortly before completion. The Canyonero sequence was originally planned to be displayed during the closing credits. The production team liked the scene so much that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> it to be obscured by the credits and gave it its own segment {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E
5|$|On the Wednesday at 1:00, Galatasaray fans {{attacked}} {{a bar in}} Str√∏get in Copenhagen, where some Arsenal fans were located. The Arsenal fans left the bar to confront the Galatasaray fans, {{which led to a}} fight lasting for an hour before riot police managed to control it and arrested four Britons and four Turks. In the fight, Paul Dineen, an Arsenal fan, was stabbed, leading to Arsenal offering fans refunds if <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to fly to the game. Dineen was released from hospital later in the day and attended the match as a guest of the Arsenal directors.|$|E

They also talk about the medication they take, and about the side-effects - namely cardiac attacks, which seem to have replaced direct death from the virus. Advertising for prevention is also exposed for being too positive and showing images of attractive men with AIDS.|$|R

5|$|One Arsenal supporter, Paul Dineen {{was stabbed}} {{in the back with}} a knife, during the riots in a pub, near the City Hall Square. The {{incident}} caused Arsenal to offer their fans full compensation, if <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to travel and attend the match. Another three members of the public, identified as one Englishman, Turk and Dutchman were also wounded by knifing when the event was still under its way. Sixty people, all presumed to have been involved, were detained by Danish law enforcement, while another 19 suffered injuries {{as a result of the}} violence.|$|E
5|$|The Labour Party {{rejected}} the line, stating that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> any transport {{that made it}} easier to live outside the municipal boundary, to keep tax money within the municipality. The final permission from Oslo City Council was granted after a vote with 49 to 35 in May 1913. Concession from the ministry was granted from Sj√∏mannsskolen to Ljan on 7 October, and from Oslo Hospital to Sj√∏mannsskolen on 11 December. On 5 June 1914, permission was granted where the concession was transferred from Thune-Larsen and Helliesen to the company Ekebergbanen, which was founded on 27 March 1914. The company received a share capital of NOK850,000, later increased to 2.5 million. Engineer J√∏rgen Barth became the first director.|$|E
5|$|After Houston {{received}} word that Santa Anna was leading a large force to San Antonio, Bowie offered to lead volunteers {{to defend the}} Alamo from the expected attack. He arrived with 30men on January 19, where they found a force of 104men with a few weapons and a few cannons, but not many supplies and little gunpowder. Houston {{knew that there were}} not enough men to hold the fort in an attack and had given Bowie authority to remove the artillery and blow up the fortification. Bowie and the Alamo commander, James C. Neill, decided they did not have enough oxen to move the artillery, and <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to destroy the fortress. On January 26, one of Bowie's men, James Bonham, organized a rally which passed a resolution in favor of holding the Alamo. Bonham signed the resolution first, with Bowie's signature second.|$|E

5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the war the Arctic front remained stale. The German High Command did not regard it as an important theatre and therefore refrained from transferring the substantial reinforcements needed for a renewal of the offensive. The Finns likewise were not interested in continuing the offensive on their own as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to antagonize the Western Allies further. In September 1944, following a series of devastating German defeats, the Finns sued for peace with the Soviet Union and had to give up all their territorial conquests. The Germans subsequently retreated from Central Finland to Petsamo and Norway. In October 1944, the Red Army conducted the Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation and achieved a decisive victory over the German forces in the Arctic by completely expelling them from Finland.|$|E
5|$|Helikopter Service flew between Bod√∏ Airport to V√¶r√∏y and R√∏st‚Äîthe island {{community}} {{further out}} from V√¶r√∏y‚Äîwith three weekly services from 1973. The helicopters doubled as serving for {{search and rescue}} duty; in case they were needed for the latter flights to V√¶r√∏y and R√∏st were cancelled. The regional airports in Lofoten and Vester√•len opened in 1972, with the V√¶r√∏y and R√∏st service being taken over by Wider√∏e on 1 September 1973. As <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to operate helicopters, they subcontracted the operations to Helilift. The service operated twice per day on weekdays and once per day in the weekends, using two sixteen-seat Sikorsky S-58Ts. Subsidies of 1.9 million Norwegian krone (NOK) was granted for the route in 1973, and the service transported 5,359 passengers (from both R√∏st and V√¶r√∏y). At V√¶r√∏y the helicopters landed at Hanna Bakken-jordet in S√∏rland.|$|E

The band declined {{on the grounds that}} <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to be associated with a burger chain and they felt that the Coq Roq advertisements were deliberately co-opting the band's signature look and style in order to influence its fans to purchase the chain's products.
