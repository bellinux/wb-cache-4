50|$|The V-10 had a {{conventional}} empennage, {{with a slightly}} <b>tapered</b> tailplane <b>mounted</b> at mid-fuselage height and fitted with inset elevators.

50|$|Usually, {{the entire}} {{tailstock}} is {{moved to the}} approximate position {{that it will be}} needed by manually sliding it along its ways. There, it is locked in place and the tool mounted to it is moved with a leadscrew to the exact position where it is needed. When a cutting tool such as a drill bit or reamer is used, the feed is done with this leadscrew. The tailstock quill or extendible portion usually has a Morse <b>taper</b> <b>mount</b> in the end of it to secure the drill or reamer. If the work is heavy the drill may be further secured from turning with a lathe dog as shown in the photo.|$|R

2500|$|After {{the cooling}} {{problems}} and some issues concerning the undercarriage had been resolved, the same aircraft flew as the Pa.61B Arbalète but {{proved to be}} underpowered with the Hirth engine. As a result, a new machine, the Pa.61F Arbalète II, was built, powered by a [...] Lycoming O-360 air-cooled flat-four engine with side air intakes on the semi-monocoque, circular cross-section fuselage. The Arbalète II's cockpit was {{large enough to hold}} three. The mid-span fins were different, slightly straight <b>tapered,</b> <b>mounted</b> on the trailing edge and extending below it. [...] Below the rudders they carried airbrakes. The slight sweep on the centre wing section trailing edge has led to a description of the wing plan as [...] "crescent" [...] rather than delta. A [...] narrow continuation of {{the leading edge of the}} wing to the nose formed strakes on each side. There were control surfaces on the trailing edges both within and beyond the fins. The Arbalète II's main undercarriage legs were moved inboard, mounted on the wing but close to the fuselage.|$|R
50|$|The MA700 is {{conventional}} configuration, with a non-swept <b>tapered</b> wing <b>mounted</b> {{high on the}} mid-fuselage. Its two Pratt & Whitney Canada PW150C {{engines are}} tractor-mounted. The 2008 model was equipped with 6-bladed slightly swept propellers. The main bogies of the tricycle landing gear are carried on faired pods outside the pressure capsule. The empennage has T-tail configuration. The 2008 model showed 28 exterior window openings {{on each side of}} the passenger area.|$|R
50|$|The tail was conventional, with a near {{triangular}} fin {{and straight}} edged rudder. The NiD 590's tailplane was straight <b>tapered</b> and <b>mounted</b> {{on top of}} the fuselage. Its undercarriage was fixed, its mainwheels on bent axles with streamlined drag struts and short, vertical oleo struts to the forward engine mounting frame. The wheels were enclosed in fairings, and there was a castoring tail wheel. Steering on the ground was control through hand operated differential brakes.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the first}} uses of <b>tapers</b> was to <b>mount</b> drill bits {{directly}} to machine tools, {{such as in the}} tailstock of a lathe, although later drill chucks were invented that mounted to machine tools and in turn held non-tapered drill bits.|$|R
50|$|The D.430's tail was conventional, with a blunted {{triangular}} fin and a deep, {{round edged}} unbalanced rudder. Its <b>tapered</b> tailplane was <b>mounted</b> {{on top of}} the fuselage, braced by two struts on each side to the lower fuselage, and carried narrow, full span elevators.|$|R
50|$|It is a 1-1/2 story, {{stone and}} masonry house notable for its wide {{overhanging}} roof with exposed rafter tails, and a gabled portico supported by <b>tapered</b> square columns <b>mounted</b> on stone piers.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} for achieving tightly concentrated optical field by a hybrid photonic-plasmonic device in an integrated platform, which is a triangle-shaped metal <b>taper</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on top of a}} dielectric waveguide. This device, which we call a plasmomic light concentrator (PLC), can achieve side-coupling of light energy from the dielectric waveguide to the plasmonic region and light focusing into the apex of the metal taper(at the scale ~ 10 nm) at the same time. For demonstration, we numerically investigate a PLC, which is a metal (Au) taper on a dielectric (Si 3 N 4) waveguide at working wavelengths around 800 nm. We show that three major effects (mode beat, nanofocusing, and weak resonance) interplay to generate this light concentration phenomenon and govern the performance of the device. By coordinating these effects, the PLC can be designed to be super compact while maintaining high efficiency over a wide band. In particular, we demonstrate that under optimized size parameters and wavelength a field concentration factor (FCF), which is the ratio of the norm of the electric field at the apex over the average norm of the electric field in the inputting waveguide, of about 13 can be achieved with the length of the device less than 1 um for a moderate tip radius 20 nm. Moreover, we show that a FCF of 5 - 10 is achievable over a wavelength range 700 - 1100 nm when the length of the device is further reduced to about 400 nm. Comment: 14 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} is a flat sided monocoque which tapers {{gently to}} the rear, with the straight <b>tapered</b> tailplane <b>mounted</b> {{on top of}} it and forward of the fin. The rear surfaces are fabric covered. The straight edged rudder extends to the keel and moves in a cut-out between the elevators, one of which has a trim tab. The cockpit, mostly ahead of the wing leading edge, seats pupil and instructor in tandem with a single set of instruments that they can both see. The fixed, two part forward canopy reaches almost to the nose; a rear transparent section opens sideways for access to both seats. The Lie-Fang lands on a fixed monowheel undercarriage under the wing, fitted with brakes and aided by a short, rubber sprung nose skid and a tail bumper.|$|R
25|$|Built {{mostly from}} aluminum, the XV-1 {{fuselage}} {{consisted of a}} streamlined tube mounted on skid landing gear, with a rear-mounted engine and a pusher propeller. It also had <b>tapered</b> stub wings <b>mounted</b> high on the fuselage.

A three-bladed main rotor powered by blade tip pressure jets was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage, above the wing roots.|$|R
50|$|Behind {{the engine}} the {{fuselage}} is flat sided. The pilot's windscreen is {{just ahead of}} the wing leading edge but the side glazing of the single-seat cabin extends back to about two-thirds chord. The cabin roof extends into raised rear fuselage decking, which drops away slowly to the tail. The Donald has a tailskid undercarriage with main wheels mounted on split axles, hinged on a shallow V-strut attached to the fuselage underside.

Below the wing there was a long, shallow ventral fin which also ended at the trailing edge.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{is almost}} flat sided and bottomed but with raised, rounded decking behind the single seat cockpit and canopy. The empennage is conventional, with <b>tapered</b> horizontal surfaces <b>mounted</b> {{near the top}} of the fuselage and a curved fin carrying a broad, balanced rudder. The rudder extends down to the keel, so the elevators are cut away to allow its movement.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the design, fabrication and characterisation of high power semiconductor mode locked lasers (SMLLs), operating at ~ 1. 5 μm. The devices are based on a novel epitaxial structure with three quantum wells (QW) in the active region. The novel epitaxial structure was based on a commercially available five-QW AlGaInAs/InP epitaxial structure, with the number of QWs reduced to increase the gain saturation energy and a farfield reduction layer (FRL), and a spacer layer were inserted in the n-cladding layer. SMLLs based on both the five-QW and three-QW material, were fabricated and comparatively investigated. The devices based on the three-QW material exhibited an increased average output power, as well as reduced RF linewidth and pulse widths. The average output power obtained in the mode locked operation from a 40 GHz MLL, based on this three-QW material was limited to 28 mW. Single mode ridge waveguide semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) were monolithically integrated with the SMLLs, which increased the average output power to 130 mW. The devices performance was investigated at both the saturable absorber (SA) and SOA facets. Transform limited pulses with a minimum duration of 3. 3 ps and a peak power of > 1 W were obtained at the SOA facet. To take advantage of the higher saturation output power of the tapered SOAs, SMLLs were monolithically integrated with 2 ° and 6 ° tapered SOAs, respectively. The devices integrated with 2 ° <b>tapered</b> SOAs were <b>mounted</b> on Aluminium Nitride (AlN) sub-mounts using Gold-Tin (AuSn) soldering for better heat sinking. These devices resulted in an average output power of 200 mW, with corresponding peak power > 1. 2 W. The SMLLs integrated with 6 ° <b>tapered</b> SOAs, <b>mounted</b> on conventional brass sub-mounts resulted in a lower output power (105 mW), compared to the devices integrated with ridge waveguide and 2 ° tapered SOAs, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of needle type and insertion depth, apical preparation size, and root canal curvature on irrigant extrusion by using a recently introduced method. Methods Sixteen human teeth with a straight root canal (group A) and 16 with a moderately curved root canal (group B) were sequentially prepared to sizes 25 or 35,. 06 <b>taper</b> and <b>mounted</b> on a plastic vial filled with distilled water to simulate a periapical lesion. The vial was either closed or open to the environment. A point-conductivity probe was used to determine the volume of extruded irrigant into the vial. NaOCl was delivered by an open-ended or a closed-ended needle at 1, 3, or 5 mm short of working length. Results were analyzed by two 4 -way mixed-design analyses of variance. The level of significance was set to P <. 05. Results The open-ended needle extruded significantly more irrigant than the closed-ended. Irrigant extrusion decreased as needles moved away from working length or when the apical size was increased. Needle wedging increased extrusion, especially when an open-ended needle was used. Root canal curvature did not have a statistically significant effect on irrigant extrusion. Conclusions Needle type, needle insertion depth, and apical preparation size had a significant effect on irrigant extrusio...|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} was a plywood monocoque, tapering to the tail. A single piece, side hinged, moulded perspex canopy enclosed {{the single}} seat cockpit from the {{nose to the}} leading edge, with an additional small roof transparency aft of the leading edge. The empennage was conventional, with a straight <b>tapered</b> tailplane <b>mounted</b> on a small step above the fuselage, carrying straight edged elevators with gaps at their roots between elevator and fin and at the tips between them and rearward extension of the tailplane tips. The elevators were mass balanced by a weight within the fuselage but not aerodynamically balanced. A narrow fin with a small forward fillet rose above the tailplane to the full height of the rudder, which was broad with a rounded heel, flat tipped and also unbalanced. The rudder extended down to the keel, requiring a cut-out in the aft part of the elevators for its movement. Like the ailerons the horizontal tail was covered with fabric over ply but the fin was simply ply skinned and the rudder fabric covered. The IS-4 had a short, rubber sprung skid reaching from the nose to under about mid-canopy and a fixed, unsprung monowheel under the wing, fitted with a brake. There was also a small tail bumper, protecting {{the bottom of the}} rudder.|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} parameter {{study is}} presented of potential reductions in induced drag {{and increases in}} lateral-directional stability due to sheared wing tips attached to an untwisted wing of moderate sweep and aspect ratio. Sheared tips are swept and <b>tapered</b> wing-tip devices <b>mounted</b> in {{the plane of the}} wing. The induced-drag results are obtained using an inviscid, incompressible surface-panel method that models the nonlinear effects due to the deflected and rolled-up wake behind the lifting surface. The induced-drag results with planar sheared tips are compared to straight-tapered tip extensions and nonplanar winglet geometries. The lateral-directional static-stability characteristics of the wing with sheared tips are estimated using a quasi-vortex-lattice method. For certain combinations of sheared-tip sweep and taper, both the induced efficiency of the wing and the relevant static-stability derivatives are predicted to increase compared to the wing with a straight-tapered tip modification...|$|R
50|$|One of the {{hallmarks}} of Martin-Baker designs was the simple but efficient installation of main systems. The clean and orderly cockpit was set well back, allowing a good view downwards behind the wing. A crash post was fitted, which automatically extended to minimise structure damage and injury to the pilot {{in the event of a}} nose-over landing. A small, <b>tapered</b> tailplane was <b>mounted</b> on the top of the fuselage well forward of the stern post, while the fin and rudder combination was roughly triangular in side elevation. This arrangement placed most of the effective rudder area below the tailplane, thus providing an adequate balance to the keel surface and assuring good recovery from spins. In initial MB2 configurations, there was no fin and the rudder was mounted on the fuselage but lateral stability was unsatisfactory, with the fixed fin added later.|$|R
50|$|The Meteor has a pod-and-boom style {{fuselage}}, with a long, single-piece canopy {{above the}} upper fuselage line, {{forward of the}} wing, under which the pilot sits in a reclined position.

50|$|The Eta was a {{conventional}} parasol wing light aircraft {{that could be}} configured as a single seater or with two seats in tandem; {{it could also be}} fitted with either a fixed conventional undercarriage or floats.

The slightly <b>tapered</b> wing was <b>mounted</b> on tall faired parallel struts from the mid-fuselage, assisted by lighter diagonal struts and shorter, forward leaning supports from the upper fuselage. The single seat model placed the open cockpit just behind the wing trailing edge. The tail was conventional, with the tailplane on top of the fuselage and braced from below.

40|$|Aim (i) To {{introduce}} a new method of quantifying extruded irrigant during root canal irrigation ex vivo. (ii) to evaluate the effect of periapical tissue simulation and pressure equalization and (iii) {{to determine the effect}} of needle type, apical preparation size and apical constriction diameter on irrigant extrusion. Methodology Sixteen human single-rooted teeth were sequentially prepared to sizes 25 – 45, 0. 06 <b>taper</b> and <b>mounted</b> on a plastic vial simulating a periapical lesion. The apical constriction diameter was standardized to 0. 15 – 0. 35 mm. The vial was filled with distilled water or air and was either open to the environment or closed. A point-conductivity probe was used to determine the volume of extruded irrigant into the vial. NaOCl was delivered by an open-ended or a closed-ended needle at 3 mm short of working length. Results were analysed by two 3 -way repeated-measures ANOVAs Results The open-ended needle extruded significantly more irrigant than the closed-ended in the majority of cases (P < 0. 002). An increase in the apical size was related to decreased irrigant extrusion (P < 0. 024). The effect of constriction diameter was not significant. The water-closed and water-open methods were related to less extrusion than the air-closed and air-open methods, respectively (P < 0. 005). Open systems (water-open, air-open) allowed extrusion of larger amounts of irrigant than corresponding closed systems (water-closed, air-closed) (P < 0. 005). Conclusions The conductivity probe is a reliable method for real-time quantification of irrigant extrusion ex vivo. Not simulating tissue resistance in ex vivo experiments may lead to significant overestimation of irrigant extrusion...|$|R
