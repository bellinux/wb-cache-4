5|$|According to Herodotus, the Persian commanders were {{concerned}} {{that they would not}} be able to defeat the Ionian fleet and, therefore, would not be able to take Miletus. So they sent the exiled Ionian tyrants to Lade, where each tried to persuade his fellow citizens to desert to the Persians. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> initially unsuccessful, but in the week-long delay before the battle, divisions arose in the Ionian camp. These divisions led to the Samians secretly agreeing to the terms offered by the Persians, but remained with the other Ionians for the time being.|$|E

5|$|Cumberland's {{neighbour}} club Western Suburbs {{had used}} {{black and white}} as their colours, which {{had been taken from}} Ashfield rugby club, a second grade rugby union team which supplied many of Western Suburbs players. Unlike other clubs, Western Suburbs did not take their colours from their district rugby union team, due to Ashfield's influence at the club. Cumberland thought of using the bottle green of the Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club, as many of their team members were from there. However, the club believed that some would be unable to distinguish Western Suburbs and Cumberland if <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> taken.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the 4th Rifle Battalion, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Colonel Harold Barrowclough and positioned {{a distance from}} the west wall of the ramparts, had carried out scouting expeditions to explore the defences. Gradually, the German posts around the fortifications fell to the attacking platoons of the battalion. As on the northern side of the town, machine-gun fire from the ramparts prevented any further advance. One party reached the outer rampart but became pinned down by gunfire for several hours. By midday, the situation had settled into a temporary stalemate. In the afternoon, some German prisoners of war were sent into the town with an invitation to surrender but <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> rebuffed, as had been a similar attempt earlier that morning.|$|E
5|$|Since almost its {{inception}} in 1914, Grapico was associated with real grape juice by J. Grossman's Sons through its advertisements and business stationery. Publicly associating Grapico with genuine grape juice allowed J. Grossman's Sons to compete directly with real grape juice producers such as Welch Grape Juice Co. and have an advantage over other imitation grape flavored beverage producers. A problem with <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> that Grapico was an artificial grape drink that included neither real grape juice nor fruit from the grape.|$|E

5|$|The American Medical Association (AMA) {{opposed the}} act because the tax was imposed on {{physicians}} prescribing cannabis, retail pharmacists selling cannabis, and medical cannabis cultivation and manufacturing; instead of enacting the Marihuana Tax Act the AMA proposed cannabis {{be added to}} the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> unappealing to some legislators who feared that adding a new substance to the Harrison Act would subject that act to new legal scrutiny. Since the federal government had no authority under the 10th Amendment to regulate medicines, that power being reserved by individual states in 1937, a tax was the only viable way to legislate marijuana.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> first {{applied to}} the {{hydrolysis}} reaction catalysed by chymotrypsin. Often, the detection of an intermediate is a vital piece of evidence in investigations of what mechanism an enzyme follows. For example, in the ping–pong mechanisms that are shown above, rapid kinetic measurements can follow the release of product P and measure {{the formation of the}} modified enzyme intermediate E*. In the case of chymotrypsin, this intermediate is formed by an attack on the substrate by the nucleophilic serine in the active site and the formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate.|$|E
5|$|Flower, Sun, and Rain {{forms the}} final {{part of an}} {{unofficial}} trilogy with Moonlight Syndrome, a spin-off of the Twilight Syndrome series Suda's final work for Human Entertainment, and The Silver Case. According to Suda, while they use the same setting and have some recurring characters, there is otherwise no connection. Despite acting as a sequel to The Silver Case, and featuring a version of that game's protagonist Sumio Kodai, the story was almost completely unrelated {{to the events of}} The Silver Case. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> inspired by the Star System utilized by manga artist Osamu Tezuka. The opening scene, where Mondo drives his car towards the island, was put into the game to both introduce Mondo's character to newcomers, and to throw players of The Silver Case off guard and confirm Mondo's two different identities in the two games. It also helped establish the setting and get the player used to Mondo's point of view. His portable computer Catherine, stored in a suitcase, was a reference to the events of The Silver Case due to earlier events being concentrated within it. Despite this, its silver color was coincidental rather than a deliberate reference to the previous game's title.|$|E

5|$|Lacking that guidance, discussions {{began on}} how the bequest money should be spent. The City Lands Committee {{suggested}} in a report that the bequest should be spent on educating {{a larger number of}} boys and <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> adopted in 1826. A number of people including Richard Taylor, a printer and an assistant to the founding of University College London, urged the Corporation of London to spend the bequest on creating a day school for the largest possible number of boys. In 1830, they proposed that the City of London Corporation School be founded with Taylor as a governor, and that the school to be established {{on the site of the}} disused London Workhouse. In the mean time, a small number of boys, who became known as Carpenter's scholars, were sent to Tonbridge School. In 1829, an Act of Parliament was passed to transform the workhouse into a school and governors were appointed. Conditions at the workhouse site had deteriorated and much money was needed for its maintenance. The only funds available, though, were the same £300 (about £22,000 in 2008) a year budget the workhouse had received.|$|E
5|$|Petrus Christus {{placed his}} sitter in a naturalistic setting {{rather than a}} flat and featureless background. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> in part a {{reaction}} against van der Weyden, who, in his emphasis on sculptural figures, utilised very shallow pictorial spaces. In his 1462 , Dieric Bouts went further by situating the man in a room complete with a window that looks out at a landscape, while in the 16th century, the full-length portrait became popular in the north. The latter format was practically unseen in earlier northern art, although it had a tradition in Italy going back centuries, most usually in fresco and illuminated manuscripts. Full-length portraits were reserved for depictions of the highest echelon of society, and were associated with princely displays of power. Of the second generation of northern painters, Hans Memling became the leading portraitist, taking commissions from as far as Italy. He was highly influential on later painters and is credited with inspiring Leonardo's positioning of the Mona Lisa {{in front of a}} landscape view. Van Eyck and van der Weyden similarly influenced the French artist Jean Fouquet and the Germans Hans Pleydenwurff and Martin Schongauer among others.|$|E
5|$|Phenomenology is {{a method}} of inquiry that {{attempts}} to examine the structure of consciousness in its own right, putting aside problems regarding the relationship of consciousness to the physical world. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> first proposed by the philosopher Edmund Husserl, and later elaborated by other philosophers and scientists. Husserl's original concept gave rise to two distinct lines of inquiry, in philosophy and psychology. In philosophy, phenomenology has largely been devoted to fundamental metaphysical questions, such as the nature of intentionality ("aboutness"). In psychology, phenomenology largely has meant attempting to investigate consciousness using the method of introspection, which means looking into one's own mind and reporting what one observes. This method fell into disrepute {{in the early twentieth}} century because of grave doubts about its reliability, but has been rehabilitated to some degree, especially when used in combination with techniques for examining brain activity.|$|E

5|$|Section 1(2) of the Act {{creates an}} offence which {{includes}} {{all the elements}} of the section 1(1) offence with an additional element of intending or being reckless as to the endangering of life. The offence lies in possible effects of the defendant's actions and it is not therefore necessary to prove an actual danger to life. However, there must be a connection between the damage and the mental state of the defendant. In R v. Steer (1986), the defendant fired a gun intending to injure another person, but missed and hit a window instead; it was held that although the intention to endanger life and the fact of damage coexisted, the damage itself did not endanger life. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> extended in R v. Webster (1995), in which the relationship between the damage caused and the damage intended was explored. That case involved the throwing of heavy items into the paths of moving vehicles, and it was held that a defendant may be guilty if he intends to endanger life by the actual damage intended, or is reckless that life will be endangered by that damage. Therefore, although a defendant does not necessarily intend to endanger life when he intends to break a car window, ignoring the likely risk that this will cause the driver to swerve into the path of another vehicle, perhaps fatally, constitutes recklessness and is a sufficient causative nexus.|$|E
