5|$|If the {{reaction}} path proceeds over one or several intermediates, kcat {{will be a}} function of several elementary rate constants, whereas in the simplest case of a single elementary reaction (e.g. no intermediates) it will be identical to the elementary unimolecular rate constant k2. The apparent unimolecular rate constant kcat is also called <b>turnover</b> <b>number</b> and denotes the maximum number of enzymatic reactions catalysed per second.|$|E
5|$|Vmax is {{only one}} of several {{important}} kinetic parameters. The amount of substrate needed to achieve a given rate of reaction is also important. This is given by the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km), which is the substrate concentration required for an enzyme to reach one-half its maximum reaction rate; generally, each enzyme has a characteristic Km for a given substrate. Another useful constant is kcat, also called the <b>turnover</b> <b>number,</b> which is the number of substrate molecules handled by one active site per second.|$|E

Systems over silica were also analyzed by transmission electron microscopy and EXAFS. The metallic dispersion decreased from 20 % to 7 % when the content of Pd was increased from 0. 5 wt. -% to 3 wt. -% in monometallic catalysts. The addition of 3 wt. -% Cu to obtain Pd-Cu catalysts caused a remarkable capacity loss of hydrogen chemisorption. TPR analysis suggested an interaction between the two metals and EXAFS characterization of the catalyst supported on silica confirmed the formation of Pd-Cu alloy.
