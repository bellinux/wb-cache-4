2500|$|Goodloe came to Meadville {{even though}} he knew it was {{unlikely}} he would be ordained by a Unitarian church, because none would accept a black minister. President Southworth wrote, [...] "I find <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>in</b> putting the possibilities squarely before him that he has come here with his eyes open, knowing that it is probably not a good way into the orthodox ministry, but ready to take the consequences." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{note with}} dismay and regret {{the events of}} <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>in</b> Lahore and we condemn this attack without reservation. It {{is a source of}} great sadness that {{there have been a number}} of {{fatalities}} in this attack and it is also very upsetting for the wider cricket family that some of the Sri Lanka players and one match official have been injured in this attack. At this time our thoughts and prayers are with the injured people and also the families of those who have died." ...|$|E
2500|$|Charlotte Church {{was born}} Charlotte Maria Reed in Llandaff, a {{district}} of Cardiff, Wales.

2500|$|During an {{appearance}} on ITV's <b>This</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>in</b> July 2013, Hopkins revealed she would stop her children playing with their classmates based on their given names. She revealed a particular dislike for [...] "lower class" [...] names like Charmaine, Chantelle, and Chardonnay, which met with disapproval from co-host Holly Willoughby.

[...] "We sent from Chile our condolences to the families of those killed and injured in these cowardly attacks and our support to the Government of Belgium."

I'm sure this action against a few, the whole world will respond with justice and solidarity for peace to triumph over hatred." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{justify the}} use of deadly force, it is not enough, however, for the police officer to merely express a {{subjective}} fear of death or great bodily harm. Unreasonable fear cannot justify {{the use of}} deadly force. The use of deadly force must be objectively reasonable and necessary, given {{the totality of the}} circumstances. Based upon our thorough and exhaustive review of the facts of this case, it is my conclusion that the use of deadly force by Officer Yanez was not justified, and that sufficient facts exist to prove that to be true. Accordingly, we filed a criminal complaint <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>in</b> Ramsey County.In his press conference announcing his decision to prosecute Yanez, Choi noted facts not consistent with a justified fear of Castile, namely that Yanez's partner, Officer Kauser, who was standing at the car's passenger window during the shooting, [...] "did not touch or remove his gun from its holster",and that in his answers to questioning by Saint Anthony Police Officer Tressa Sunde immediately after the shooting, Yanez [...] "stated he did not know where [...] gun was". Choi also noted that ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yet I must allay your joy," [...] {{said the}} old glover, [...] "though, Heaven knows, I share it. Poor Oliver Proudfute, the inoffensive fool that you and I knew so well, has been found <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> dead <b>in</b> the streets." ...|$|R
2500|$|Following his death, many {{charities}} {{revealed that}} Michael had privately been {{a supporter of}} them for many years. Dame Esther Rantzen, the {{founder and president of}} Childline, said he had given them [...] "millions" [...] over the years and said that he had given the royalties from his 1996 number one single [...] "Jesus to a Child" [...] to the charity. He had supported the Terrence Higgins Trust [...] "for many years" [...] as well as Macmillan Cancer Support. Michael also donated to individuals: he reportedly called the production team of the quiz show Deal or No Deal after a contestant had revealed that she needed £15,000 to fund IVF treatment, and anonymously paid for the treatment personally; and once tipped a student nurse working as a barmaid £5,000 ($6,121) because she was in debt. On 3 January 2017, another woman came forward and (with the permission of Michael's family) revealed he had anonymously paid for her IVF treatment after seeing her talk about her problems conceiving on an episode of <b>This</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>in</b> 2010. The woman gave birth to a girl in 2012.|$|E

60|$|Although in one {{instance}} the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and Mrs. Weston's visit <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> was <b>in</b> another respect particularly opportune. Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to make Emma want their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wanted exactly the advice they gave.|$|R
60|$|So I tramped down <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>in</b> the snow-storm--and {{there was}} a {{stirring}} time. They will sail a week or ten days from now.|$|E

60|$|Still {{that smell}} of hot coffee. Ever {{after it was}} {{associated}} in Armand's mind with <b>this</b> awful <b>morning</b> <b>in</b> the guard-house of the Rue Ste.

6000|$|... "Are {{you going}} to Almayer's house? They say in the {{settlement}} that Dain the trader, he that was found drowned <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> is lying <b>in</b> the white man's campong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hem!" [...] said Mr. George. [...] "You remember, miss, that {{we passed}} some {{conversation}} {{on a certain}} man <b>this</b> <b>morning?</b> Gridley," [...] <b>in</b> a low whisper behind his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is my duty," [...] Griffiths proclaimed impatiently, [...] "to arrest {{that man}} as a spy. I have authority, granted me <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>in</b> London." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have heard}} from him. I saw the letter <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>in</b> the box. I knew the handwriting. I {{have been waiting for}} you to speak." ...|$|E
