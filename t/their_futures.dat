5|$|Lady Gaga: Queen of Pop has 288 pages, {{including}} 32 {{pages of}} photographs of the musician. The author compares Lady Gaga to Madonna, writing that both are independent and work to assert control over <b>their</b> <b>futures.</b> The book discusses Lady Gaga's early life and background, including her upbringing in a New York City household with her father, a businessman. Born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta on March 28, 1986, from age 11 she attended Convent of the Sacred Heart high school; the same high school as Paris Hilton. Germanotta was not popular with her fellow pupils because of her experimentation with exotic dance, drugs, and bisexuality. By age 13, she had written her first song and her mother took her to nightclubs to perform at open-mic events. Germanotta gained entry to the Tisch School of the Arts in New York at age 17, but left and started using drugs while performing as a go-go dancer. After a period of difficulty with her father, she ceased this behavior pattern.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} the study was {{engineering}} students? particular understanding of the ?creativity? category and their attitude to the possible results of <b>their</b> <b>future</b> careers. In the article the semantic space of the ?creativity? category in the minds of engineering students is identified; and the connection of the associative space of ?creativity? category of engineering students with <b>their</b> <b>future</b> professional activity is examined; the sort of social responsibility for possible consequences of <b>their</b> <b>future</b> professional activity for society and the environment is determined. The results show that engineering students are poorly aware of the connection between <b>their</b> <b>future</b> careers and creativity. Though the majority of future scientific, technical and engineering employees will continue their careers, they seldom realize the harm caused to society and the environment. ????????? ???????????? ????????? ??????????? ????????? ????????? ???????????? ?????????? ???????????? ???????????? ? ????????? ? ????????? ??????????? ?? ??????? ???????????????? ????????????. ? ?????? ???????? ????????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????????? ? ???????? ????????? ???????????? ????????????; ??????????????? ????? ?????????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????????? ????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ? ?? ??????? ???????????????? ?????????????; ???????????? ???????? ?????????? ??????????????? ? ????????? ????????????? ???????????? ??????????? ?? ??????? ???????????????? ???????????? ? ????????? ???????? ? ?????????? ?????. ?????????? ???????????? ??????????, ??? ???????? ???????????? ???????????? ????? ???????? ????? ??????? ???????????????? ???????????? ? ???????????. ??? ???? ??????????? ??????????? ??????? ??????-??????????? ? ?????????? ?????????? ????? ?????????? ???? ???????????????? ????????????, ???? ????????? ????, ????????? ???????? ? ?????????? ?????...|$|R

25|$|After these insults, the {{government}} passed the Renunciation Act of 1944, {{a law that}} made it possible for Nisei and Kibei to renounce their American citizenship. A total of 5,589 internees opted to do so; 5,461 of these were sent to Tule Lake. Of those who renounced US citizenship, 1,327 were repatriated to Japan. Those persons who stayed in the US faced discrimination from the Japanese-American community, both during and after the war, for having made that choice of renunciation. At the time, they feared what <b>their</b> <b>futures</b> held were they to remain American, and remain interned.|$|E
25|$|Davis' fought Chris Lytle at UFC 93 on January 17, 2009. Both {{fighters are}} former boxers and had {{discussed}} a potential fight in <b>their</b> <b>futures</b> since early 2008. Lytle called out Davis at UFC 89. He {{suggested that the}} fight take place in Ireland, where Davis had gained a substantial following due to his emphasis on his Irish roots. Leading up to the event, both fighters promised to stand and trade blows for the entire fight, rather than engage in grappling. Lytle managed to stun Davis several times, but Davis used superior footwork, counter-punching, and kicks to win a split decision. The bout shared Fight of the Night honors with the Coleman/Rua co-main event, earning Davis a $40,000 bonus.|$|E
25|$|For {{more than}} a decade since the Bringing Them Home report was {{submitted}} to Liberal Prime Minister John Howard, he and his coalition colleagues consistently rejected calls for a formal government apology, though some coalition government members stated that they were personally sorry for the outcomes of the policy. They were concerned that a formal apology could be construed as an admission of deliberate wrongdoing, rather than acknowledging that the originally stated intentions of the government were believed to be {{in the interests of the}} children and <b>their</b> <b>futures.</b> Howard and his supporters were concerned that such an apology would suggest that the government would be admitting liability in any duty-of-care legal proceedings.|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} affective forecasting bias {{related to}} projection bias is personality neglect. Personality neglect {{refers to a}} person’s tendency to overlook their personality when making decisions about <b>their</b> <b>future</b> emotions. In {{a study conducted by}} Quoidbach and Dunn, students’ predictions of <b>their</b> feelings about <b>future</b> exam scores were used to measure affective forecasting errors related to personality. They found that college students who predicted <b>their</b> <b>future</b> emotions about <b>their</b> exam scores were unable to relate these emotions to their own dispositional happiness. To further investigate personality neglect, Quoidbach and Dunn studied happiness in relation to neuroticism. People predicted <b>their</b> <b>future</b> feelings about the outcome of the 2008 US presidential election between Barack Obama and John McCain. Neuroticism was correlated with impact bias, which is the overestimation of the length and intensity of emotions. People who rated themselves as higher in neuroticism overestimated their happiness in response to the election of their preferred candidate, suggesting that they failed to relate their dispositional happiness to <b>their</b> <b>future</b> emotional state.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the future {{orientation}} of adolescents with intellectual disabilities from the Arab sector in Israel and their parents regarding <b>their</b> <b>future.</b> The findings showed that adolescents really do give a lot of thought to <b>their</b> <b>future,</b> but that there are gender related differences in <b>their</b> <b>future</b> orientations. There were gender differences in the <b>future</b> orientation of <b>their</b> children amongst the fathers in contrast to mothers. A match was found between the orientations of both parents; no correlation was found between the orientation of the parents and the future orientation of the adolescents...|$|R
25|$|An {{example of}} how to {{overcome}} these obstacles and encourage greater voter participation among low income and homeless citizens {{was done by the}} National Coalition for the Homeless and other national advocacy and grassroots social movement groups. These groups collaborated to create a manual that promotes voting access for low income and homeless persons to ensure that those who are economically disadvantaged maintain an active role and voice in shaping <b>their</b> <b>futures.</b> The manual is designed to provide ideas to help overcome the many obstacles that prevent people experiencing homelessness from becoming registered, active voters. By working together with homeless persons, low-income individuals, and advocates around the country, grassroots social movement organizations can work alongside homeless and low-income persons to make their voices heard on Election Day.|$|E

The club {{retained}} many of the 2007–08 promotion winning team, and added several signings, both permanent and on loan. Gary Waddock and Martin Kuhl also committed <b>their</b> <b>futures</b> to the club by signing new three-year contracts. Joel Grant was sold to Crewe Alexandra for £130,000, a club record. On {{the opening day of}} the 2008–09 season, Aldershot Town won their first league game on their return to the Football League at Accrington Stanley 1–0. This was followed four days later by the club's first ever Football League Cup game, against Coventry City at the Ricoh Arena, which the Shots lost 3–1.

25|$|Once he {{is legally}} elected President of the Confederacy, Featherston slowly and quietly twists the Confederate Constitution into giving him more power. He {{maneuvers}} the Supreme Court into striking {{itself out of}} existence, provokes the black minority toward rebellion with race riots, creates farm machinery to root {{them out of their}} livelihoods so he could incarcerate them in concentration camps, and repeals the single term limit so he could run multiple times. In the meantime, the black rebellions give the CSA a plausible excuse to reinstitute conscription and arm itself. He manipulates Socialist US President Al Smith into allowing the states of Kentucky, Houston, and Sequoyah (all formerly part of the Confederacy) to hold plebiscites to determine <b>their</b> <b>futures.</b> Kentucky and Houston vote to rejoin the Confederacy with Houston also rejoining Texas, while Sequoyah, which had been saturated with settlers {{from other parts of the}} north, voted to remain part of the US.|$|E
25|$|Social class {{mobility}} {{could be}} low because of housing inequality. People who live or {{were born in}} the housing inequality, they have more problems to solve instead of making money. And what's more, Their children are less likely to get higher education in order to get into higher class in <b>their</b> <b>futures.</b> It could lower the social class mobility to our self and so does our next generation. The major problem of first generation is about earning money for family because of housing inequality. It's hard to get a loan from bank and lots of bills to pay. They just worry how to survive to tomorrow. But for our children, they deserve a better future, but under housing inequality, they need more time and money to get the same education as who are not suffering from housing inequality. These makes them give up their education easily but {{this is the only way}} they can get into higher class in the future. Not so many of people can make it.|$|E
