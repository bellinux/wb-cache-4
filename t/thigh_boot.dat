50|$|Burberry Prorsum {{championed the}} <b>thigh</b> <b>boot</b> in Autumn 2007 {{with a black}} patent leather model, which was shown with several pieces from their medieval knight-inspired line. The boot {{featured}} a four-inch heel and pointed toe.|$|E
50|$|A {{select group}} of European cobblers have {{specialized}} in higher-priced <b>thigh</b> <b>boots</b> for the fetish market. Legendary among these was the London-based Little Shoe Box, which crafted both ready-to-wear and custom <b>thigh</b> <b>boots</b> in leather and real patent leather. The Little Shoe Box, however, ceased operations in 2005 after 40 years of operation. Three other cobblers, Leatherworks Ltd. (London), Biondini (Italy) and Jean Gaborit of Paris have continued the tradition of producing higher quality fetish <b>thigh</b> <b>boots.</b> Jean Gaborit also specializes in boots and made-to-measure boots.|$|R

50|$|Fendi {{supported}} the <b>thigh</b> <b>boot</b> cause in Autumn 2008 with a chunky suede boot that featured a metallic leather accent around the ankle {{of the boot}} {{and at the top}} of the heel. The boot was carried by several different retail outlets and was available in black, brown, taupe, and gray.|$|E
50|$|As for the couture shoe designers, Christian Louboutin marketed no {{less than}} four {{different}} styles in Autumn 2009 - a front-lacing mid-thigh length with sculpted heel and hidden platform (Supra Fifré), a crotch-length, skin-tight boot with hidden platform, a chunky mid-thigh boot (Contente), and a chunky platform mid-thigh boot. In addition to one heeled <b>thigh</b> <b>boot</b> featuring an elastic cuff just above the knee and two pairs of flat over-the-knee boots in their couture line, Jimmy Choo's limited edition capsule collection for H&M featured a mid-thigh black leather boot with a four-inch heel.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Thigh</b> <b>boots</b> are {{a regular}} staple of several Italian {{boutique}} brands, including: ...|$|R
50|$|Couture fashion {{designers}} marketing <b>thigh</b> <b>boots</b> will vary {{from year to}} year. Introducing a boot model is typically tied to the designer's theme for the line. These boots will typically be marketed at the highest price point for <b>thigh</b> <b>boots</b> and, usually, for shoes in general. Fashion designers market similarly, though {{at a lower price}} point.|$|R
50|$|In {{the world}} of women's fashion, <b>thigh</b> <b>boots</b> run through cycles in both {{popularity}} and design. As referenced by several authors, {{the popularity of the}} motion picture Pretty Woman hurt the credibility of <b>thigh</b> <b>boots</b> as wardrobe staples. Nevertheless, in any fall fashion season, at least one or more designers and retailers will take a chance on their appeal.|$|R
50|$|In World War II, Hunter Boot {{was again}} {{requested}} to supply {{vast quantities of}} Wellington and <b>thigh</b> <b>boots.</b> 80% of production was of war materials - from (rubber) ground sheets to life belts and gas masks. In the Netherlands, the British forces were working in flooded conditions which demanded Wellingtons and <b>thigh</b> <b>boots</b> in vast supplies.|$|R
5000|$|Motion {{pictures}} in which <b>thigh</b> <b>boots</b> were prominent in an actress' wardrobe include: ...|$|R
50|$|Narciso Rodriguez {{created a}} stir in Autumn 2003 when {{almost half the}} models in his {{ready-to-wear}} show were wearing his <b>thigh</b> <b>boots</b> with his clothing line. The boots featured four-inch heels and pointed toes. Phoebe Philo at Chloé showed leather and suede <b>thigh</b> <b>boots</b> in several colors, including red and green, {{in addition to the}} more typical black and brown.|$|R
50|$|<b>Thigh</b> <b>boots</b> are {{considered}} by many to be erotic or kinky. They are used as fetish clothing in boot fetishism and shoe fetishism. Cheaper <b>thigh</b> <b>boots</b> are often worn by prostitutes and professional dominatrices, so many people consider them icons of such trades. Because of the latter, they are often associated with sadomasochism. Nevertheless, they are frequently sold by couture designers, perhaps because of the implied eroticism.|$|R
50|$|Until the 2000s, fetish <b>thigh</b> <b>boots</b> were {{generally}} distinguished from fashion boots by being more extreme in many design dimensions, particularly heel height and platform height. In the late 2000s, this trend {{began to change}} as couture designers, particularly Christian Louboutin, began to experiment with more extreme designs in their shoes. Consequently, {{the difference between the}} two now is more a function of the materials used. In particular, fetish <b>thigh</b> <b>boots</b> tend to be constructed of polyurethane (PU) or vinyl (often incorrectly referred to as patent leather). In addition, they are generally produced in China and sold at low cost. An example line of inexpensive fetish <b>thigh</b> <b>boots</b> is sold under the brand name Pleaser.|$|R
50|$|Roberto Cavalli showed {{many of his}} {{designs in}} Autumn 2001 with his <b>thigh</b> <b>boots.</b> The boots {{featured}} four-inch heels and pointed toes.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{shoes in}} general, fashion <b>thigh</b> <b>boots</b> are marketed through several {{different}} channels. A key differentiator among these channels {{is the price}} point and construction: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Thigh</b> <b>boots</b> as {{articles}} of fetish clothing {{date back to}} at least the 1950s when Irving Klaw used them in the costuming {{of the women in}} his erotic photography. Since that time, they have been a staple of fetish and adult photography. For instance, Bob Guccione photographed the 1982 Penthouse Pet of the Year, Corinne Alphen, in a pair of black leather <b>thigh</b> <b>boots</b> for her feature layout. Similarly, Dwight Hooker photographed the Playboy 25th Anniversary Playmate, Candy Loving, in white leather over-the-knee boots for her layout.|$|R
50|$|Karl Lagerfeld styled {{all of his}} {{designs in}} the Autumn 2006 Chanel {{collection}} with <b>thigh</b> <b>boots.</b> The boots were finished {{in a variety of}} materials, including black suede and different shades of blue denim.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} couture shoe design houses {{regularly}} include <b>thigh</b> <b>boots</b> in their collections, {{and the price}} point will be at a premium, just as with the couture fashion designers. Examples of these designers are: ...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1990 film Pretty Woman, the protagonist, Vivian Ward (played by Julia Roberts), wears {{her black}} vinyl <b>thigh</b> <b>boots</b> {{throughout}} much of {{the first part of the}} movie as a symbol of her role as a prostitute.|$|R
50|$|Thigh-high boots, known also as thigh-length <b>boots</b> {{or simply}} <b>thigh</b> <b>boots,</b> are boots that extend above the knees. Other terms for this {{footwear}} include over-the-knee boots (abbreviated OTK boots; the full term {{is also used}} for the 15th century riding boots for men, later adopted by women) and, especially when cuffed, pirate boots. Lengths vary from reaching just over the knee to reaching almost to the crotch (referred to as crotch boots or crotch-high boots).|$|R

50|$|For World War II, {{the company}} was again called upon to supply vast {{quantities}} of wellington and <b>thigh</b> <b>boots.</b> 80% of production was for war materials - from ground sheets to life belts and gas masks. In the Netherlands, forces were working in flooded conditions which demanded Wellingtons and tight boots in vast supplies.|$|R
5000|$|In the 2006 film The Devil Wears Prada, the protagonist, Andy Sachs (played by Anne Hathaway), completes her ugly-duckling-to-swan {{transformation}} by strutting confidently {{into her}} employer's offices {{wearing a pair}} of Chanel black leather <b>thigh</b> <b>boots.</b> Andy's wardrobe for this scene {{and the rest of the}} movie was styled by noted costumer, stylist, and designer Patricia Field.|$|R
5000|$|The {{price point}} for these boots {{can be very}} high, {{particularly}} at retail boutiques, but will vary more than for couture designers. Some brands are available through eBay sellers and clearance sellers (e.g., YOOX) at discounted prices. The lowest price tier is typically the fashion retailers. Retailers who regularly market <b>thigh</b> <b>boots</b> in their line include: ...|$|R
50|$|Miuccia Prada {{pushed the}} margins of fashion with her <b>thigh</b> <b>boots</b> {{designed}} after hip boots for fishing. One version even featured garters to suspend the tops from a belt. Right behind her was Stella McCartney, featuring three crotch-length boots with synthetic uppers, in following with her usual animal-friendly practice. All three had snipped toes and extreme stiletto heels, and one featured a multi-patterned, pierced upper.|$|R
50|$|The uniform {{members of}} the Company wear is {{identical}} to that worn by the HAC in the reign of Charles I. It comprises Venetian red tunics with white linen collars and cuffs and knee-length breeches. The seniority of officers and non-commissioned officers is signified {{by the amount of}} lace worn on collars and cuffs; the more lace the more senior the rank. Officers wear <b>thigh</b> <b>boots</b> and spurs.|$|R
5000|$|... "Je suis un vrai garçon" [...] was {{a daring}} and risky song for Eurovision at the time, but had the fortune {{to be drawn}} to be {{performed}} last of the 25 participating entries. Morato, in a memorable all black outfit - including leotard, jacket, velvet top hat and high-heeled <b>thigh</b> <b>boots</b> - was joined on stage by Chedid, and delivered a confident performance, {{which resulted in a}} seventh-place finish.|$|R
50|$|<b>Thigh</b> <b>boots</b> {{are made}} of {{materials}} ranging from various leathers to various synthetic materials (includuing vinyl, polyurethane, or latex) to various fabrics (such as silk or polyester microfiber). Many are constructed with zippers, but some are designed as pull-on boots. Heel heights vary, but most styles are either flat or with heels greater than 3 inches (7.5 cm). Heel styles vary from metal spikes to chunky. Like other boots, they can also have platform soles.|$|R
50|$|Hawker's {{innovative}} ideas at {{this time}} greatly benefited the still fledgling RFC. He helped to invent the Prideaux disintegrating link machine-gun belt feed, and initiated the practice of putting fabric protective coverings on the tips of wooden propellers, the use of fur-lined <b>thigh</b> <b>boots,</b> and devising a primitive 'rocking fuselage' for target practice on the ground. In 1916 he also developed (with W.L. French) the increased capacity 97-round 'double drum' for the Lewis machine gun. It was issued for trials in July and after modifications was issued generally to the RFC and RNAS.|$|R
50|$|The town of Angmagssalik, {{founded in}} 1895, {{was still very}} {{primitive}} when Hutchison arrived in 1927. She stayed there for four days and collected flowers, sailing in an umiak and visiting a Greenlandic tent home. She bought kamiker (<b>thigh</b> length <b>boots)</b> and wore them {{to keep out the}} biting insects.|$|R
50|$|After {{eight seasons}} on air, One Tree Hill {{returned}} for thirteen episodes in its ninth and final season, with Bethany famously sashaying around in <b>thigh</b> high <b>boots</b> {{to save her}} husband. On November 17, 2011, Lenz filmed her last scenes as the character Haley James Scott. The show ended on April 4, 2012.|$|R
50|$|Characters had 12 {{different}} equipment slots (head, shoulders, {{left and}} right arms, gloves, chest, shirt, belt, pants, {{left and right}} <b>thighs,</b> and <b>boots)</b> in addition to two weapon slots, allowing for one ranged weapon, one or two melee weapons, or a shield. Armour was divided into 6 types: robe, cloth, leather, reinforced leather, chain mail, and plate.|$|R
2500|$|Dress and {{equipment}} changed considerably across the period {{to have the}} most efficient and effective accoutrements current economics would allow. [...] Other ranks' clothing was largely identical to that of common working men. [...] The manuals recommend tunics and coats no longer than the knee. [...] As an army marches first of all on its feet, the manual writers were more concerned that troops should have good footwear than anything else. [...] This ranged from low lace up shoes to <b>thigh</b> <b>boots,</b> all to be fitted with [...] "a few (hob) nails". [...] A head-cloth ("phakiolion" [...] or [...] "maphorion") which ranged from a simple cloth coming from below the helmet (as still worn by Orthodox clergy) to something more like a turban, was standard military headgear in the Middle and Late Empire for both common troops and for ceremonial wear by some ranks; they were also worn by women.|$|R
