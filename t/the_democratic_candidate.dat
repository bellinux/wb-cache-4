5|$|Gingrich {{sought a}} rematch against Flynt in 1976. While the Republicans did {{slightly}} {{better in the}} 1976 House elections than in 1974 nationally, <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> in the 1976 presidential election was former Governor of Georgia Jimmy Carter. Carter won {{more than two-thirds of}} the vote in his native Georgia. Gingrich lost his race by 5,100 votes.|$|E
5|$|In September 1923, Democratic gubernatorial nominee J. Campbell Cantrill died, {{leaving the}} party without a candidate. Alben Barkley, who Cantrill had {{defeated}} for the nomination, {{refused to be}} <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate,</b> perhaps because he had already {{decided to run for}} the U.S. Senate in 1926. The Democratic Central Committee chose Fields as a replacement for Cantrill.|$|E

5|$|After Kerr's death, Randall was the {{consensus}} {{choice of the}} Democratic caucus, and {{was elected to the}} Speakership when Congress returned to Washington on December 2, 1876. He assumed the chair at a tumultuous time, as the presidential election had just concluded the previous month with no clear winner. <b>The</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate,</b> Samuel J. Tilden of New York, had 184 electoral votes, just shy of the 185 needed for victory. Rutherford B. Hayes, the Republican, had 163; the remaining 22 votes were in doubt.|$|E
5|$|Despite the state's general Republican and {{conservative}} leanings, Democrats have found success in various statewide elections, {{most notably in}} those involving South Dakota's congressional representatives in Washington. American Indians have been becoming more active in state and county electoral politics. In the 2002 election, American Indian voting carried Tim Johnson as <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> {{by a margin of}} 532 votes. Until his electoral defeat in 2004, Senator Tom Daschle was the Senate minority leader (and briefly its majority leader during Democratic control of the Senate in 2001–02).|$|E
5|$|Following {{the custom}} of the times—that {{candidates}} not appear to seek the office—Tyler stayed home throughout the campaign, and made no speeches. Tyler received only 47 electoral votes, from Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee, in the November 1836 election, trailing both Granger and <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate,</b> Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky. Harrison was the leading Whig candidate for president, but he lost to Van Buren. The presidential election was settled by the Electoral College, but for {{the only time in}} American history, the vice presidential election was decided by the Senate, which selected Johnson over Granger on the first ballot.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{never gave}} up on a return to public service. He ran an {{unsuccessful}} campaign for the U.S. Senate against John J. Crittenden in 1842. He briefly and futilely sought his party's nomination for president in 1844. He also ran as an independent candidate for Governor of Kentucky in 1848, but after talking with <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate,</b> Lazarus W. Powell, who had replaced Linn Boyd on the ticket, Johnson decided to drop out and back Powell. Some speculated that the real object of this campaign was to secure another nomination to the vice-presidency, but this hope was denied.|$|E
5|$|Swisher was {{an active}} member of the West Virginia Democratic Party. In 1900, he was {{selected}} as a candidate for State Superintendent of Free Schools. In the 1902 general election, he ran as <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> for the Eleventh District of the West Virginia State Senate. Despite his loss, Swisher received the largest number of Democratic votes ever amassed in Monongalia County up until that time. Swisher was a delegate at the 1936 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, and was selected as an alternate delegate to the Democratic National Conventions of 1912 and 1924.|$|E
5|$|The party split grew, and in 1912, Taft and Roosevelt were rivals for the Republican nomination. The 1912 Republican National Convention was bitterly divided. At Taft's request, Harding gave {{a speech}} nominating the president, but the angry delegates were not {{receptive}} to Harding's oratory. Taft was renominated, but Roosevelt supporters bolted the party. Harding, as a loyal Republican, supported Taft. The Republican vote was split between Taft, the party's official candidate, and Roosevelt, running under the label of the Progressive Party. This allowed <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate,</b> New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson, to be elected.|$|E

5|$|Although {{given the}} first name Lewis, Willkie was known from {{childhood}} by his middle name. Herman Willkie, who had come from Prussia with his parents at age four, was intensely involved in progressive politics, and in 1896 took his sons to a torchlight procession for Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan, {{who had come to}} Elwood during his campaign. The Willkie boys had a sidewalk fight with Republican youths, and though the Willkies won their battle, Bryan did not, defeated by former Ohio governor William McKinley. When Bryan ran again in 1900, he stayed overnight at the Willkie home, and <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> for president became the first political hero for the boy who would later seek that office.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was unusual}} at {{the time for a}} {{national}} candidate to actively campaign, Johnson gave a number of speeches in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. He also sought to boost his chances in Tennessee while re-establishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive, in that voters would now have to swear they opposed making a settlement with the Confederacy. <b>The</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> for president, George McClellan, hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation, and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters. Lincoln declined to override Johnson, and their ticket took the state by 25,000 votes. Congress refused to count Tennessee's electoral votes, but Lincoln and Johnson did not need them, having won in most states that had voted, and easily secured the election.|$|E
5|$|Brown is {{a member}} of the Republican Party, and faced <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate,</b> Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley in the 2010 special election, which had {{occurred}} after the 2009 death of long-time Senator Ted Kennedy for the remainder of Kennedy's term ending January 3, 2013. While initially trailing Coakley in polling by a large margin, Brown saw a sudden late surge in the polls and posted a surprise win to become the first Republican elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. Brown ran for a full Senate term in 2012, but lost to Democratic challenger Elizabeth Warren. He subsequently joined the board of directors of Kadant paper company, joined Fox News as a commentator, and joined Nixon Peabody where he provided legal services.|$|E

5|$|In 1840, Davis {{first became}} {{involved}} in politics when he attended a Democratic Party meeting in Vicksburg and, to his surprise, was chosen as a delegate to the party's state convention in Jackson. In 1842, he attended the Democratic convention, and, in 1843, became a Democratic candidate for the state House of Representatives from the Warren County-Vicksburg district; he lost his first election. In 1844, Davis {{was sent to the}} party convention for a third time, and his interest in politics deepened. He was selected as one of six presidential electors for the 1844 presidential election and campaigned effectively throughout Mississippi for <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> James K. Polk.|$|E
5|$|Union Democrats chose Joshua Fry Bell {{as their}} {{candidate}} for governor of Kentucky in 1863, but Bell was skeptical of Kentucky's future with the Union and withdrew his name from consideration. The party's central committee chose Bramlette to replace Bell, and Bramlette declined a commission as a brigadier general in the Union Army to make the race. During the election, Union forces intimidated and jailed supporters of Bramlette's opponent, former governor Charles A. Wickliffe. As a result, Bramlette carried the election {{by a margin of}} nearly 4-to-1. During his term, he turned down an offered seat in the U.S. House of Representatives as well as a nomination to become <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> for Vice-President in 1864.|$|E
5|$|After Tillman {{returned}} from Chicago to South Carolina, he suggested he had delivered an intentionally radical speech {{so as to}} allow Bryan to look statesmanlike by comparison. This interpretation was mocked by his enemies. Tillman is not known to have otherwise discussed his feelings at the failure of his presidential bid, and the political grief was likely overwhelmed by personal sadness {{a week after the}} convention when his beloved daughter Addie died, struck by lightning on a North Carolina mountain. Tillman campaigned for Bryan, but was a favorite target of cartoonists denigrating <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> and supporting the Republican, former Ohio governor William McKinley. Bryan had also been nominated by the Populists, who selected their own vice presidential candidate, Georgia's Thomas E. Watson. Tillman was active in efforts to get Watson to withdraw, having a 12-hour meeting with the candidate, apparently without result. Tillman traveled widely to speak on Bryan's behalf, and drew large crowds, but his speeches were of little significance. Despite undertaking an arduous campaign, Bryan lost the election. Simkins suggested that Tillman, by helping forge an image of the Democratic Party as anarchic, contributed to Bryan's defeat.|$|E

5|$|Marshall {{opened a}} law {{practice}} in Columbia City in 1876, taking on many minor cases. After gaining prominence, he accepted William F. McNagny {{as a partner}} in 1879 and began taking many criminal defense cases. The two men functioned well as partners. McNagny was better educated in law and worked out their legal arguments. Marshall, the superior orator, argued the cases before the judge and jury. Their firm became well known in the region after they handled a number of high-profile cases. In 1880 Marshall ran for public office {{for the first time as}} <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> for his district's prosecuting attorney. The district was a Republican stronghold, and he was defeated. About the same time, he met and began to court Kate Hooper, and the two became engaged to marry. Kate died of an illness in 1882, one day before they were to be wed. Her death was a major emotional blow to Marshall, leading him to become an alcoholic.|$|E
5|$|Sherman {{was elected}} in 1892 to a sixth term, easily {{defeating}} <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> in the state legislature. The more difficult fight had been for the Republican caucus's vote, as many preferred Foraker to Sherman. With assistance from Cleveland businessman Mark Hanna, and after four days of balloting, the caucus agreed to support Sherman over Foraker, and he was reelected by the full legislature on January 12, 1893. In 1894, Sherman surpassed Thomas Hart Benton's record for longest tenure in the Senate. His memoirs, Recollections of Forty Years in the House, Senate and Cabinet, were published the following year. In 1896 he gave speeches on behalf of fellow Ohioan William McKinley in his campaign for the presidency, but took a lesser role than in previous campaigns because of his advanced age. McKinley was elected over Democrat William Jennings Bryan. Wishing to see the appointment of Hanna, his friend and political manager, to the Senate, McKinley created a vacancy by appointing Sherman to his cabinet as Secretary of State.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasingly}} unpopular war in Korea dragged on, and the Truman {{administration was}} beset {{with a series}} of corruption scandals. He eventually decided not to run for re-election. Adlai Stevenson, <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> in the 1952 presidential election, attempted to distance himself from the President as much as possible. The election was won by the Republican candidate, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose administration ramped up the pressure on the Chinese in Korea with conventional bombing and renewed threats of using nuclear weapons. Coupled with a more favorable international political climate {{in the wake of the}} death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, this led the Chinese and North Koreans to agree to terms. The belief that the threat of nuclear weapons played an important part in the outcome would lead to their threatened use against China on a number of occasions during the 1950s.|$|E
