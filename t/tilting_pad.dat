30|$|The {{effects of}} surface {{roughness}} characteristics on the fluid load capacity of <b>tilt</b> <b>pad</b> thrust bearings with water lubrication were studied {{by the average}} flow model. The flow factors utilized in the average flow model were simulated with various surface roughness parameters including skewness, kurtosis and the roughness directional pattern.

The fluid load capacity was dramatically affected by the roughness directional pattern. The skewness had a lower effect than the roughness directional pattern.

40|$|Abstract: The axial {{displacement}} fault {{has very little}} indication before taking place and the fracture of oil film between thrust disk and <b>tilt</b> <b>pads</b> mainly contributes to this breakdown. Usually this fracture {{was caused by the}} contamination of oil or decrease of oil supply pressure which result in losing load bearing capacity of oil film. Also the increase of axial force caused by fluctuation of operation condition can result in the oil film fracture. Both of the above reasons can lead to <b>tilt</b> <b>pads</b> abrasion and emergency shutdown of machine. The method presented in this paper monitors the stiffness of oil film and identifies the reason of {{axial displacement}} increasing. By introducing the mechanism of axial displacement fault self-recovering and taking the axial displacement as the control objectives, the axial forces on rotor was controlled on-line and the minimum oil film thickness was ensured in real time. The experiment indicated that the mechanism can realize the axial fault self-recovery effectively, and with this system, the centrifugal compressor doesn’t need to be shut down immediately when the axial displacement fault happens...|$|R

Michell's guidance by George Weymoth (Pty) Ltd, for a centrifugal pump at Cohuna on the Murray River, Victoria, Australia, in 1907, {{just two years}} after Michell had published and patented his three-dimensional solution to Reynold's equation. By 1913, the great merits of the tilting-pad bearing had been recognised for marine applications. The first British ship to be fitted out with the bearing was the cross-channel steamboat the Paris, but many naval vessels were similarly equipped during the First World War. The practical results were spectacular - the troublesome thrust block became dramatically smaller and lighter, significantly more efficient, and remarkably free from maintenance troubles.

Also the bearing needs to be designed in order to be suited for the rotor-bearing system and operating condition. In this paper, it is observed that the static and dynamic characteristics of a five pad <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> bearing for the LBP and LOP configurations are influenced by the variation of preload and pivot offset. In this context, rotor dynamic analysis of the 5 MW industrial gas turbine supported by the <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> bearing at the front and roller bearing at the rear is carried out based on the dynamic coefficients of the <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> bearing investigated.

Alternative configurations, such as gas filled columns and submerged motor pumps, will require development. Continued development, in general, should be expected due to changing technology and industry changes.

Eight of the programs occurred from 1996 to 2000. All involve long shaft pumps; all involve testing at TNX; and all involve a problem of some kind.

40|$|LectureTilting pad {{bearings}} {{are used}} extensively in high power and/or high speed pump applications. Traditional white metallined {{also known as}} babbitted <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> bearings are used for oil lubricated bearings. Babbitted <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> bearings are not ideal for applications with low viscous lubricants, like waterbased fluids. For these applications, polymer bearings offer many advantages over traditional bearing materials including: Low friction coefficient, Higher flexibility, Wide range of operational temperature, High corrosion and chemical resistance, High shock and impact resistance, Tolerance against particle contamination, Electrical insulation. To achieve the desired improvement in performance, the material specifics of the polymer have to be carefully considered in the design process. One option available is a polymer lined <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> bearing which combines the excellent tribological properties of polymers and the high structural stiffness of the steel back. But a polymer lined metal pad does not provide the same equalizing effect offered by the higher compressibility of a solid polymer pad. For example the problems of an edge carrier can be reduced for a <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> journal bearing and the self-equalizing mechanism can be avoided for a <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> thrust bearing while considering the higher flexibility of solid PEEK pads. An additional advantage of a solid polymer pad is {{the elimination of the}} bonding between the polymer and the steel, so that a possible source of a bearing failure can be avoided upfront already. During a qualification test of a commercially available solid polymer <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> thrust bearing, the high Hertzian contact stress at the pivot let to indentations in the polymer. After a few operating hours these indentations are clearly visible and will finally lead to a complete loss of the advantages of a <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> bearing over a fixed geometry bearing. This lecture describes the steps involved in the optimization of the solid polymer <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> bearing design, with the objective to increase the reliability of the bearing assembly. The limitations of the available solid polymer <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> thrust bearing have been overcome by the integration of a metal reinforced pivot as mentioned by Gassmann et al. (2013). The results of the TEHD analysis presented form the base of the optimized journal and thrust bearing design. The new journal and thrust bearing design has been validated through testing of a prototype. The data collected during tests with the optimized thrust and journal bearings are in excellent agreement with the simulations. With the optimized bearing design, the limitations of the original pad design have been mitigated. The successfully qualified journal and thrust bearing are one of the building blocks required for product lubricated pumps and will be used in subsea pump applications...|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 31 - 42 Analysis, design, and {{optimization}} of {{high performance}} journal and thrust bearings {{in a high}} speed integrally geared compressor are described. The high speed and relatively small bearing size stretches the applicable limits of conventional style <b>tilt</b> <b>pad</b> bearings. The variation in the load magnitude, {{as is the case}} with most gear loaded bearings, requires careful analysis of the stability and unbalance response characteristics. An optimized new flexible pivot bearing was used in this application to provide stable operation throughout the wide ranges of load and inlet temperature. The bearing incorporated a directed lubrication feature to reduce the hot oil carry over which is known to be a major contributor to high bearing temperatures in high speed applications. The precision inherent in the manufacturing process used to produce this style of bearing allowed further optimization of the preload and pivot offset. The use of an offset pivot configuration demonstrated lower sensitivity to bearing clearance variation. The necessity for high rotational speeds in integrally geared compressors increases the frictional power losses in the journal and thrust bearings. The parasitic losses constitute a significant percentage of the overall bearing power losses. Bearing designs that were utilized to reduce both the frictional and parasitic losses in the thrust bearings are discussed. The new thrust bearings were designed to provide an optimum crown-to-film thickness ratio allowing the bearing to carry the design thrust load with fewer pads. The analytical results for the conventional and deflection journal and thrust bearings are presented and compared to the test data. The new bearing resulted in lower steady state vibrations. At surge conditions, the synchronous and subsynchronous vibrations were about 25 percent of the conventional <b>tilt</b> <b>pad</b> bearing. The frictional and parasitic power losses with the new thrust bearing were about 20 percent lower than those of the conventional bearings. The temperature rise was also lower which indicated that the inlet temperature can be further increased with the new bearing allowing a wider operating temperature range and lower frictional losses...|$|R
