5|$|Despite a shaky {{start at}} the anchor desk, Jennings' {{broadcast}} began to climb in the ratings. Jennings was praised for his performance during the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, when he anchored ABC's coverage of the event for 11 straight hours. By 1989, competition among the three nightly newscasts had risen to fever pitch. When the Loma Prieta earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay area, media pundits praised Jennings and ABC News for their prompt on-air response, while criticizing the delayed reaction of <b>Tom</b> <b>Brokaw</b> and NBC News. The next month, Brokaw redeemed himself by scooping the other networks with news {{of the fall of}} the Berlin Wall. It was World News Tonight, however, that ended the year at the top; ABC's evening newscast spent the last 13 weeks of the year in first place, and its average ratings for the entire year beat CBS for the first time.|$|E

2500|$|Foss co-authored or was {{the subject}} of three books {{including}} the wartime Joe Foss: Flying Marine (with Walter Simmons); Top Guns (with Matthew Brennan); and A Proud American by his wife, Donna Wild Foss. Foss also provided the foreword to Above and Beyond: the Aviation Medals of Honor by Barrett Tillman, and was profiled in <b>Tom</b> <b>Brokaw's</b> 1998 book about World War II and its warriors, The Greatest Generation. Brokaw characterized Foss: [...] "He had a hero's swagger but a winning smile to go with his plain talk and movie-star looks. Joe Foss was larger than life, and his heroics in the skies over the Pacific were just the beginning of a journey that would take him to places far from that farm with no electricity and not much hope north of Sioux Falls."Brave Eagle, a 1955 postwar effort to film a story of Foss's life, starring his friend, John Wayne, fell through in 1956 when Foss refused to allow the producers to add a fictitious love story. American Ace: The Joe Foss Story was an award-winning, hour-length television documentary, produced by the South Dakota Public Broadcasting, first aired in fall 2006.|$|R

40|$|<b>Tom</b> <b>Brokaw’s</b> {{book is a}} {{focus on}} today’s {{problems}} and challenges that face students, families, veterans, workers, and persons of all business. He {{emphasizes the importance of}} citizens taking the social responsibility of preparing a future for their children and grandchildren who deserve the same opportunities as he and his readers had in their youth. He asks that Americans re-enlist as citizens, work together to think of bold and innovative ideas, and be proactive in implementing solutions. Brokaw supports his opinions with actual stories of individuals who are actively involved in making America a better place. “What has happened to us? ” “Have we lost our way? “Will our children and grandchildren have better lives than us?”(pp. ix- x). Hearing these dispirited questions throughout the country, Brokaw said {{it was time for a}} conversation about the problems facing Americans and there is a dire need to implement bold and proactive solutions to address the issues. Brokaw’s first strength is demonstrated through his discussion on education. With more than 40 million Americans being illiterate, more than 10 percent of college students taking remedial reading, and American teens ranking 25 th in math, 14 th in reading, and 17 th in science among 34 countries, he emphasizes education reform is a national imperative...|$|R
