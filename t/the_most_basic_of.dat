The Court of Appeal has called {{the right to life}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> <b>of</b> human rights, but has yet to fully define the term in the Constitution. Contrary to the broad position taken in jurisdictions such as Malaysia and the United States, the High Court of Singapore has said that personal liberty only refers to freedom from unlawful incarceration or detention.|$|E

500|$|A 2010 paper {{written by}} Karli June Cerankowski and Megan Milks, titled New Orientations: Asexuality and Its Implications for Theory and Practice, {{suggests}} that asexuality {{may be somewhat}} of a question in itself for the studies of gender and sexuality. Cerankowski and Milks have suggested that asexuality raises many more questions than it resolves, such as how a person could abstain from having sex, which is generally accepted by society to be <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> <b>of</b> instincts. Their New Orientations paper states that society has deemed [...] " [...] female sexuality as empowered or repressed. The asexual movement challenges that assumption by challenging many of the basic tenets of pro-sex feminism [...] already defined as repressive or anti-sex sexualities." [...] In addition to accepting self-identification as asexual, the Asexual Visibility and Education Network has formulated asexuality as a biologically-determined orientation. This formula, if dissected scientifically and proven, would support researcher Simon LeVay's blind study of the hypothalamus in gay men, women, and straight men, which indicates {{that there is a}} biological difference between straight men and gay men.|$|E
500|$|The characters' resolutions in Lightning Returns {{received}} much criticism. Marty Silva of IGN found the {{writing for the}} characters uninteresting, and that the game had [...] "forgotten why we ever liked these characters in the first place." [...] VanOrd stated that every character was [...] "defined by <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> <b>of</b> traits, all of which {{serve the needs of}} the plot, rather than the plot flowing from the needs of the characters." [...] He also felt that their dialogue was overly frequent and poorly written. GamesRadar's Ryan Taljonick found Lightning off-putting, and saw the inclusion of the other characters as [...] "more like a ham-fisted attempt at fan-service than a critical plot element." [...] Kotaku's Mike Fahey was also unimpressed both with Lightning and how the other characters had stayed very much the same between XIII-2 and Lightning Returns, with them needing Lightning to move on. Dave Riley of Anime News Network found that the characters had improved slightly over their previous appearances, saying [...] "Dropping the pretense of stoic seriousness transmutes some of the sub-series's most insufferable elements into something marginally more tolerable, especially as it regards its main character." ...|$|E
500|$|The Dreamcast {{version was}} heavily criticized. Ryan Davis of GameSpot stated that [...] "the {{best bet for}} all {{involved}} would be to take your chips elsewhere". Similarly, IGN editor Jeremy Dunham noted that [...] "the blandness of the game's presentation would probably disappoint <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> <b>of</b> cavemen. Even the graphics are disappointing. True, those card tables can look very realistic, but {{what else is there}} to marvel at? Nothing! Without any type of exploration feature, or other characters there isn't anything to render". Allgame's Bryan Hightower criticized that [...] "there are not enough games, there are annoying wait times, and the help mode is terrible". He also complained that [...] "the dealer deals painfully slow and has to say what cards you have twice. You can already read your hand right on the screen, so you don't need the dealer to waste your time". Hightower also cited that [...] "when you win at slots, the camera always goes {{to the bottom of the}} machine to show you the payout scale" [...] which [...] "becomes frustrating after a few credits because it is so slow. The act of leaving the table or machine is even slower". He also said that the advice the game gives you is [...] "Perhaps the most irritating 'feature' of this game" [...] because [...] "Each time you do something the computer wouldn't have done, a pop-up screen will appear that adds more time to the lengthy procedure of completing a bet". Hightower commented that [...] "The above-par graphics are quickly negated by the rock-bottom enjoyment factor" [...] and that [...] "this game doesn't have any of the character the real casino has".|$|E

This quantified notion of moneyness is most importantly used in defining the relative volatility surface: the implied volatility in terms of moneyness, rather than absolute price. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> <b>of</b> these measures is simple moneyness, which is the ratio of spot (or forward) to strike, or the reciprocal, depending on convention. A particularly important measure of moneyness is the likelihood that the derivative will expire in the money, in the risk-neutral measure.

The song's fate was still in doubt when the Edge was sent a prototype of the Infinite Guitar by Canadian musician Michael Brook, with whom he had collaborated for the Captive soundtrack. The instrument allowed sustained notes to be played, producing [...] "a similar effect to the E-Bow", but with the ability to provide all the [...] "mid-points between no sustain and infinite sustain" [...] that the E-Bow cannot provide. The prototype included elaborate assembly instructions and as the Edge recollects, [...] "one wrongly placed wire and you could get a nasty belt of electricity.
