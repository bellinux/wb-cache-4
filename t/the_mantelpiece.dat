5|$|The cousins {{went back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to search for the source of the red paint on the silencer. In the kitchen they found marks in the red paint on the underside of <b>the</b> <b>mantelpiece</b> above the Aga cooker. DI Cook, a scenes-of-crime officer, took a paint sample from <b>the</b> <b>mantelpiece</b> on 14 August. This was found to contain the same 15 layers of paint and varnish that were in the paint flake found on the silencer. Casts were taken of the marks on the mantel, and the marks were deemed consistent with the silencer having come into contact several times with <b>the</b> <b>mantelpiece.</b> The implication was that the silencer had scratched <b>the</b> <b>mantelpiece</b> during a fight for the gun.|$|E
5|$|Sutherst {{said the}} scratch marks {{appeared}} in photographs taken on 10 September 1985, 34 {{days after the}} murders, but were not visible in the original crime-scene photographs. He also said {{he had failed to}} find in the photographs any chipped paint on the carpet below <b>the</b> <b>mantelpiece,</b> where it might have been expected to fall had <b>the</b> <b>mantelpiece</b> been scratched during a struggle. He was asked by the CCRC to examine a red spot on the carpet visible in photographs underneath the scratches on <b>the</b> <b>mantelpiece.</b> He said the red spot matched a piece of nail varnish missing from one of Sheila's toes. He concluded that the scratch marks on the mantel had been created after the day of the murders.|$|E
5|$|The defence {{commissioned}} {{a report from}} Peter Sutherst, a British forensic photographic expert, who was asked in 2008 to examine negatives of the kitchen taken {{on the day of}} the murders and later. In his report, dated 17 January 2010, Sutherst argued that the scratch marks in the red paintwork on the kitchen mantelpiece had been created after the crime-scene photographs had been taken. The prosecution alleged that the marks had been made during the struggle in the kitchen between Bamber and his father, as the silencer, attached to the rifle, had scratched against <b>the</b> <b>mantelpiece.</b> The prosecution said that paint chips identical to the paint on <b>the</b> <b>mantelpiece</b> were found on or inside the silencer.|$|E

Persuasion would occasionally get him to perform this turn at country houses, much to {{the interest of the}} guests.|$|E
500|$|ITV {{describe}} Betty as a [...] "linchpin" [...] of {{the soap}} opera, stating that: [...] "She’s {{as much a}} part of Coronation Street as the cobble stones." [...] Former executive producer, Brian Park, suggested in 1997 that characters such as Betty [...] "are essential ingredients. They're like the big clock on the mantelpiece." [...] Park elaborated on his opinion of Betty when he left the serial as producer in 1998, saying, [...] "I don't mean it disrespectfully but [...] people like Betty Driver, who plays Betty Williams [...] are what I call <b>the</b> <b>mantelpiece</b> ornaments. She'll probably never hold down a major storyline but she's part of the weave." ...|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>mantelpieces</b> of <b>the</b> 18th century were, as a rule, {{carved in}} pine and painted white. Usually the shelves were narrow and {{supported}} by pilasters often of flat elliptic plan, sometimes by caryatids, and the frieze would consist of a raised center panel carved with a classic scene in relief, or with a mask alone, and on either side a swag of flowers, fruit and foliage.|$|R
500|$|The grand {{second floor}} library room is also of major note, {{with a high}} cathedralesque ceiling and a grand conference table {{previously}} used for board meetings by the Virginia Historical Society. As with the Sulgrave Room, <b>the</b> <b>mantelpiece</b> is made from the Hawkins manor oak and is notably carved with an Old English inscription that reads, [...] "O ye fyre and heate bless ye the Lord." [...] Behind the library panelling is a secret hidden passage, added at Alexander Weddell's request, leading to his private study. [...] The rest of the second floor consists of living quarters and bathrooms, including many rooms {{of staff of the}} Virginia Historical Society and Virginia Weddell's bedroom, bath, and study.|$|E
500|$|In The Little White Girl, Whistler {{can be seen}} {{to clearly}} move away from the realism of the French painter Gustave Courbet, who had {{previously}} been a great influence on him. The painting contrasts soft, round figures with harder geometrical shapes, using [...] "brushy, transparent touches and dense, vigorous strokes." [...] Various artists and styles have been suggested as inspirations for The Little White Girl. The painting has been compared to the work of Ingres. Though Whistler's painting was different from Ingres' art in many ways, he was nevertheless an admirer of the French artist, and was inspired by his work. The fan in the model's hand and the vase on <b>the</b> <b>mantelpiece</b> are oriental elements, and expressions of the Japonisme prevalent in European art at the time. Apart from this, there are few clues for the viewer, and the picture invites a wide variety of individual interpretations. A contemporary review in the newspaper The Times commented that [...] "Thought and passion are under the surface of the plain features, giving them an undefinable attraction." [...] Art critic Hilton Kramer sees in Whistler's portraits a charm and a combination of craft and observational skills that his more radical landscapes lacked.|$|E
500|$|Burges {{inspired}} considerable loyalty {{within his}} team of assistants, and his partnerships were long-lived. John Starling Chapple was the office manager, joining Burges's practice in 1859. It was Chapple, designer {{of most of the}} furniture for Castell Coch, who completed its restoration after Burges's death. Second to Chapple was William Frame, who acted as clerk of works. Horatio Walter Lonsdale was Burges's chief artist, contributing extensive murals for both Castell Coch and Cardiff Castle. His main sculptor was Thomas Nicholls who started with Burges at Cork, completing hundreds of figures for Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral, worked with him on his two major churches in Yorkshire, and undertook all of the original carving for the Animal Wall at Cardiff. William Gualbert Saunders joined the Buckingham Street team in 1865 and worked with Burges {{on the development of the}} design and techniques of stained glass manufacture, producing much of the best glass for Saint Fin Barre's. Ceccardo Egidio Fucigna was another long-time collaborator who sculpted the Madonna and Child above the drawbridge at Castell Coch, the figure of St John over <b>the</b> <b>mantelpiece</b> in Lord Bute's bedroom at Cardiff Castle and the bronze Madonna in the roof garden. Lastly, there was Axel Haig, a Swedish-born illustrator, who prepared many of the watercolour perspectives with which Burges entranced his clients. Crook calls them [...] "a group of talented men, moulded in their master's image, art-architects and medievalists to a man– jokers and jesters too– devoted above all to art rather than to business." ...|$|E
50|$|Internally {{the house}} is {{substantially}} intact, although friezes and a dado decoration in the hallway have been painted over. Cedar {{has been used for}} the hallway flooring, and much of the joinery, including the fixed seating in the bay windows and some of <b>the</b> <b>mantelpieces.</b> <b>The</b> remainder of the internal flooring is of pine. There are pressed metal ceilings and some cast iron mantelpieces - part of the 1880s renovations. Plaster columns in the drawing room, also part of the 1880s redecoration, have been removed. A bathroom occupies what was previously the linen room, and the kitchen is located in a former bedroom.|$|R

500|$|The {{flammability}} of the crinoline {{was widely}} reported. It is estimated that, {{during the late}} 1850s and late 1860s in England, about 3,000 women were killed in crinoline-related fires. One such incident, {{the death of a}} 14-year-old kitchenmaid called Margaret Davey was reported in The Times on 13 February 1863. Her dress, [...] "distended by a crinoline," [...] ignited as she stood on the fender of the fireplace to reach some spoons on <b>the</b> <b>mantelpiece,</b> and she {{died as a result of}} extensive burns. The Deputy-Coroner, commenting that he was [...] "astonished to think that the mortality from such a fashion was not brought more conspicuously under the notice of the Registrar-General," [...] passed a verdict of [...] "Accidental death by fire, caused through crinoline." [...] A similar case was reported later that year, when 16-year-old Emma Musson died after a piece of burning coke rolled from the kitchen fire to ignite her crinoline. A month later, on 8 December 1863, a serious fire at the Church of the Company of Jesus in Santiago, Chile, killed between two and three thousand people. The severity of the death toll is credited in part to the large amounts of flammable fabric that made up the women's crinoline dresses. Two notable victims of crinoline fires were William Wilde's illegitimate daughters, Emily and Mary, who died in November 1871 of burns sustained after their evening gowns caught fire. Slaveykov reported in 1864 that over the last 14 years, at least 39,927 women worldwide had died in crinoline-related fires, opining that it was more deadly than the practice of sati or the auto-da-fé. Although flame-retardant fabrics were available, these were thought unattractive and were unpopular.|$|E
500|$|The {{immediate}} {{legacy of}} the Temeraire {{was the use of}} the timber taken from her as she was broken up. A gong stand made from Temeraire timber was a wedding present to the future King George V on the occasion of his marriage to Mary of Teck, and is held at Balmoral Castle. A barometer, gavel, and some miscellaneous timber are in the collections of the National Maritime Museum, and chairs made from Temeraire oak are in the possession of the Royal Naval Museum, Portsmouth, Lloyd's Register, London and the Whanganui Regional Museum, Whanganui. An altar, communion rail and two bishop's chairs survive in St. Mary's Church, Rotherhithe. [...] A ship model of the Temeraire made by prisoners of war uses a stand made from wood taken from her, and is currently in the Watermen's Hall in London. Other relics of the Temeraire known to exist or have existed are a tea caddy made for her signal midshipman at Trafalgar, James Eaton, and sold at auction in 2000, the frame for an oil painting by Sir Edwin Landseer titled Neptune, and a mantelpiece made for Beatson's office, supported by figures of Atlas supposedly taken from Temeraires stern gallery. <b>The</b> <b>mantelpiece</b> can no longer be traced, nor can a plaque once fixed to Temeraires deck commemorating Nelson's signal at Trafalgar, nor a wooden leg made for a Trafalgar veteran from Temeraires wood. John Ruskin foreshadowed the fate of the Temeraires wood in an essay which claimed that [...] "Perhaps, where the low gate opens to some cottage garden, the tired traveller may ask, idly, why the moss grows so green on its rugged wood, and even the sailor's child may not answer nor know that the night dew lies deep in the war rents of the wood of the old Temeraire." ...|$|E

2500|$|The former two rooms, the [...] deuxième antichambre and the chambre du roi, were earlier {{part of the}} {{apartment}} of the queen, but in 1684, {{after the death of}} Marie-Thérèse d’Autriche, Louis XIV attached these rooms to his apartment. The deuxième antichambre served as waiting room for courtiers waiting to attend the king’s lever in the chambre du roi and was also known as the antichambre des Bassans on account of the number of paintings by the northern Italian artist, Jacopo Bassano, that were displayed on the walls. Over <b>the</b> <b>mantelpiece,</b> the famed “Noli me tangeres” by Lambert Sustris was displayed.|$|E
2500|$|The première antichambre or salon du grand couvert (also known {{during the}} reign of Louis XIV as la salle ou le roy soupe), opened with three windows onto the cour de marbre (north) and with three windows onto the cour de la reine (south). The {{decoration}} of the room consisted of battle scenes by Joseph Parrocel with the “Battle of Arbela” being displayed over <b>the</b> <b>mantelpiece.</b> After the death of the queen and the dauphine, the room served for those occasions during which Louis XIV dined alone in public. [...] For the grand couvert, a table with a single armchair was dressed before the fireplace. [...] The wall opposite the fireplace originally contained a tribune for musicians, but this was suppressed in the 18th century.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were three}} secret rooms: {{one on the}} upper storey {{between two of the}} bedrooms, another behind a {{fireplace}} in the kitchen of the 14th-century part of the building, and a third under the floor by another fireplace. [...] The first of these rooms, which measured , was accessed through a trapdoor in the floor. [...] A meat hook hanging from the ceiling of a passageway near the main kitchen had to be pulled in a certain direction to unlock the trapdoor. [...] The room under the floor was reached in a similarly awkward way: if a carving above <b>the</b> <b>mantelpiece</b> was twisted in a certain way, the fireplace would move outwards to reveal a set of steps leading down to the hiding place. [...] All of the hidden rooms have now been removed or filled in.|$|E

2500|$|Decorated with a {{high-gloss}} {{paint to}} reflect as much light as possible, the fireplace features a rustic mantelpiece called the [...] "Eighth of January". It was carved by {{a veteran of}} the Battle of New Orleans; he worked on <b>the</b> <b>mantelpiece</b> on each annual anniversary of the battle until he finished on January 8, 1839. Jackson installed the piece on January 8, 1840. Adjacent to the dining room is a pantry and storage room that leads to an open passageway to the kitchen. This was built separate from the house to prevent risk of fire to the main house, as well as to exclude the noise, heat and odors of cooking. To the right of the entrance hall, and accessed via a side hall, are two bedrooms; these were occupied by President Jackson and his son, Andrew Jackson, Jr. In the west wing is a spacious library and office used by Jackson and others to manage the plantation.|$|E
2500|$|On Monday 3 August, the Belgian Government {{rejected}} the German demand for free passage through its {{country and in}} the afternoon, [...] "with gravity and unexpected eloquence," [...] Grey spoke in the Commons and called for British action [...] "against the unmeasured aggrandisement of any power". Liddell Hart considered that this speech saw the [...] "hardening (of) British opinion {{to the point of}} intervention". The following day Asquith saw the King and an ultimatum to Germany demanding withdrawal from Belgian soil was issued with a deadline of midnight Berlin time, 11.00 p.m. (GMT). Margot Asquith described the moment of expiry, somewhat inaccurately; [...] "(I joined) Henry in the Cabinet room.

2500|$|On {{the other}} side of the Entrance Hall is the Music Room whose walls are {{decorated}} with cherry-coloured silk damask.

[...] An alcove was intended to be occupied by an organ but it contains a rosewood bookcase in boulle work. [...] The circular table, couches and chairs are also in boulle style, made by Gillows. [...] The fireplace is made from white marble and is decorated with images of musical instruments and motifs. [...] Two vases on <b>the</b> <b>mantelpiece</b> are 19th-century Meissen.

[...] To the south of the music room is the Drawing Room which is decorated in a similar style. [...] The ceiling is gilded and coffered and is decorated with rosettes. [...] Together with its elaborate furniture it is the [...] "most impressive and ostentatious room in the house". The paintings include two views of Venice by Canaletto, The Sacrifice of Noah by Poussin, The Martyrdom of St. Stephen by Van Dyck, and paintings by Annibale Carracci and Giovanni Battista Cimaroli.
