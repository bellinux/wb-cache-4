5|$|Trolley buses {{gradually}} made way for motor buses {{until the}} last electric tram or bus service ran on 12 July 1963 leaving only the Glenelg <b>tramline</b> as a remnant of a once extensive light rail network. Except for the Glenelg Type H, the trams were sold or scrapped. Some were used as shacks, playrooms or preserved by museums.|$|E
5|$|Muntz Street was readily {{accessible}} by public transport. In the early years, horse-drawn buses {{ran along the}} Coventry Road, linking Small Heath with the city centre and with other nearby districts. In 1882, {{the building of a}} <b>tramline</b> along the Coventry Road to Small Heath Park was authorised, and four years later, the Coventry Road steam tramway route was opened to a terminus near Dora Road, a few yards past the ground. In {{the early years of the}} 20th century, this line was converted for use by electric trams.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth of}} Giffnock was furthered in 1905 {{by the arrival}} of the first Glasgow Corporation Tramways tram in the town. The {{addition}} of this tram link and the nearby Whitecraigs railway station helped the popularity of Giffnock as a weekend destination and lead to the opening of Rouken Glen park in 1906 by Archibald Corbett (later Lord Rowallan), the M.P. for Tradeston. The Giffnock <b>tramline</b> was one of Glasgow Corporation Tramways's most profitable routes; up to 15,000 travelled to Giffnock on a Sunday to visit Rouken Glen.|$|E
50|$|After {{the horse}} and steam <b>tramlines</b> came into the {{possession}} of the city on 15 and 17 October 1904, it was decided on 7 December 1905 to electrify all the <b>tramlines</b> and to convert them to standard gauge.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>tramlines</b> {{connected}} {{the center of}} Athens with the suburbs (as they were at that time) such as Patissia, Ampelokipi and Kolokinthou. Other lines connected Omonoia Square with Syntagma, Gkazi, Keramiko Dipilo. By 1902, <b>tramlines</b> served Ippokratous, Mitropoleos and Acharnon streets as well.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Tramlines</b> Festival is {{an annual}} music festival held in Sheffield. The festival {{has in the}} past been free to attend, but now has premium venues where tickets are {{required}} to be purchased. The line-up consists of national and local artists. The festival is curated and organised by a panel comprising local venue owners, promoters and volunteers. The name of the festival is inspired by the city's tram network. <b>Tramlines</b> held its first festival in 2009, which attracted 35,000 fans and was seen as a huge success, and 2010's event doubled that figure. <b>Tramlines</b> 2011 took place between Friday 22 and Sunday 24 July. The success of <b>Tramlines</b> Festival 2011 led to the event winning 'Best Metropolitan Festival' at the UK Festival Awards.|$|R

25|$|Consolidation and mucoid {{impaction}} are {{the most}} commonly described radiological features described in ABPA literature, though much of the evidence for consolidation comes from before the development of computed tomography (CT) scans. <b>Tramline</b> shadowing, finger-in-glove opacities and ‘toothpaste shadows’ are also prevalent findings.|$|E
25|$|The {{withdrawal}} of trams from the Brighton <b>tramline</b> {{and the introduction}} of diesel buses to the route saw Pleasant Point services combined with those to Brighton in a new timetable, effective from 18 October 1952. As connections with trams were no longer required, the new timetable also eliminated the feeder services.|$|E
50|$|All <b>tramlines</b> run on {{standard}} gauge track {{and use the}} same overhead voltage, 750 V DC. But there are three different cab signalling systems, one for Lidingöbanan, one for Tvärbanan Alvik-Sickla and a third for Tvärbanan Solna-Alvik. This makes rolling stock incompatible. The other <b>tramlines</b> (Nockeby and City/Djurgården) have no cab signalling requirement.|$|R
50|$|The {{reconstruction}} of <b>tramlines</b> 1 and 3 was finished in this term. These lines run along two beltways {{at the border}} of the inner part of the city. The reconstruction eliminated the speed limits that had to be introduced because of poor condition of the tracks.In this term the Budai Fonódó Villamos Project (Interweaving <b>Tramlines</b> Project of Buda) was also completed. This project unified the <b>tramlines</b> of the Buda (western) side of the Capital, creating lines that enable travelling from the northern areas of the city to the southern areas, without the need to transfer from one line to another.|$|R

25|$|The {{division}} was {{to extend the}} flank opposite Combles to neutralise the German defences in Bouleaux Wood, cut the <b>tramline</b> which looped around {{the north end of}} the wood and gain touch with the 5th Division on the left. The 168th Brigade objectives were trenches between the wood and <b>tramline</b> and German dugouts along the cutting and bank of the line. The 167th Brigade was to fire machine-gun and Stokes mortar barrages at the wood and the 169th Brigade was to fire on the north and north-east exists of the village. Local liaison between the 56th Division and the French 2nd Division (General Guignadaudet) was to be maintained by the divisional commander, Major-General C. P. A. Hull, for a combined attack on the village on 26 September if necessary. Infantry supported by two tanks were to advance from Bouleaux Wood as the 2nd Division advanced from the south, depending on the resistance of the German defenders.|$|E
25|$|He {{subsequently}} subdivided {{the land}} in 1923, and sold it as a housing estate called St John's Wood after the house. In the following year the neighbouring Glen Lyon Estate was also subdivided, and the <b>tramline</b> to Ashgrove (Oleander Drive) was finally completed. This assisted in the rapid development of the area. In August 1927 a feature article appeared in the Brisbane Courier.|$|E
25|$|Trams served Belmont from 1927 to 1956. The <b>tramline</b> {{was opened}} on 16 December 1927 when the 'South' route was {{extended}} across the Barwon Bridge in Moorabool Street. The tram line ran along High Street to the terminus {{just south of}} the intersection with Roslyn Road. The extension was made possible by the completion a new wider bridge over the Barwon the same year.|$|E

25|$|Engineers' {{vehicles}} used in Tramlink construction {{were hired}} for that purpose. In November 2006 Croydon Tramlink purchased five second-hand engineering vehicles from Deutsche Bahn. These were two DB class Klv 53 engineers' trams (numbered 058 and 059 in <b>Tramline</b> service), and three 4-wheel wagons (numbered 060, 061, and 062). Service tram 058 and trailer 061 were both {{sold to the}} National Tramway Museum in 2010.|$|E
25|$|This line {{branched}} {{from the}} line to Cooks River at Newtown, and travelled down Enmore Road through Enmore, then along Victoria Road to Marrickville Road before tuning right along Marrickville Road through Marrickville and Dulwich Hill to New Canterbury Road. At the New Canterbury Road terminus, a tram turning loop was provided, this is currently used as a layover area for buses. Current Sydney Buses' route 426 follows this <b>tramline.</b>|$|E
25|$|After the Board {{purchased}} the assets and business {{of most of}} its private competitors following legislative changes in the mid-1920s, it acquired a motley collection of buses with which {{it was able to}} start services on new routes. Despite the high maintenance and inventory costs associated with these vehicles, they were used to establish permanent routes to Bryndwr (originally planned to be a <b>tramline),</b> Springfield Road, Pleasant Point (feeder service), Shirley, and Avonside.|$|E

25|$|From Alison Road, the La Perouse Line {{proceeded}} {{down the}} centre of Anzac Parade through Maroubra Junction, and Malabar to its balloon loop terminus at La Perouse. At Malabar a single line branched off to serve Long Bay Gaol. The line was double track throughout. In 1934 the fourth section of the La Perouse <b>tramline</b> was built to Bunnerong Power Station in Matraville to encourage residential and industrial growth in the area.|$|E
25|$|When it {{came time}} to {{consider}} further <b>tramline</b> closures in the mid-1930s, the Board decided to go with A.E.C. diesel buses as they felt the technology had matured {{to the point where they}} were a reliable option. Though the trolley buses introduced only a few years earlier had performed well and found favour with passengers, their dependence on fixed infrastructure did not suit the Board's preference for operational flexibility. The first order for ten chassis was placed with A.E.C. in 1935–1936.|$|E
25|$|All major <b>tramline</b> {{construction}} {{was completed by}} 1914 {{with the opening of}} the St. Martins line, after which no new lines were built. This was partly as a result of the First World War, which restricted the supply of materials and thus meant extensions to the network were not possible. Patronage, which had held up well through the war years, was constrained after war's end by economic conditions restricting the growth of the tramway below that which had been desired by the Board.|$|E
