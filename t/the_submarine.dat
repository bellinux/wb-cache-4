25|$|<b>The</b> Archer class <b>submarines</b> were {{designed}} and built by Kockums AB as single-hull, double compartment submarines optimised to reduce noise and magnetic signature.

This enables <b>the</b> <b>submarines</b> to have longer submerged endurance and lower noise signature, enhancing the stealth capability of <b>the</b> <b>submarines.</b> <b>The</b> advanced sonar system allows <b>the</b> <b>submarines</b> to detect contacts at a further distance, while the torpedo system has a better target acquisition capability, which allows <b>the</b> <b>submarines</b> to engage contacts at a longer range.|$|R

5|$|The first submarine, , {{was laid}} down in February 1990. Collins launch was {{originally}} planned for 1994, but was later set for 28 August 1993. Although launched on schedule, she was not complete: the design of <b>the</b> <b>submarine</b> had not been finalised, important internal pipes and fittings were not installed, {{the components of the}} combat system had yet to be delivered, and some hull sections were actually sheets of timber painted black so <b>the</b> <b>submarine</b> would appear complete in photographs of the launching ceremony. Within weeks of the launch, Collins was removed from the water, and it was not until June 1994 that <b>the</b> <b>submarine</b> was completed. Progress on the other five submarines was delayed by the extra effort required to meet Collins launching date and the subsequent work to complete her. Collins was not commissioned into the RAN until 27 July 1996; eighteen months behind schedule, because of several delays and problems, most relating to the provision and installation of the combat data system software. Collins was not approved for operational deployments until 2000.|$|E

During this the TARDIS inexplicably dematerialises. They then encounter the escaped Ice Warrior, Grand Marshal Skaldak (Spencer Wilding, voiced by Nicholas Briggs). The Doctor encourages the crew to be peaceful, but the ship's executive officer Stepashin (Tobias Menzies) knocks out Skaldak with a cattle prod, suspecting {{that he is not}} an alien but part of a Western plot. Knowing that Skaldak will desire vengeance for being attacked, the Doctor and the crew chain Skaldak, who sends out a distress call for others of his race to find him.|$|E
