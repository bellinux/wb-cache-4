Franziska Ehmcke, professor of Japanese studies at Cologne University, theorized that Naruto was named after whirlpools of the sea landscape of the Awa no Naruto, and compared his behavior to that natural feature, as both figures have uncontrollable energy within them.

She maintains that there are three forms of empowerment for those in charge of ritualization: objectification of office, hierarchization of practices, and creating tradition. (211) Furthermore, in some ways ritual defines the self. Tambiah and Bloch in contrast to some other scholars view the formalization of ritual as furthering the divide between one’s sense of self and one’s ritual practices.

Looking simply at coverage {{of the opportunity to}} hold a job that entails at least 20  hours of employment per week, for example, the average ranges from about 30 percent for countries like Armenia and Azerbaijan to 80 percent in Czech Republic. There is also variation across opportunities as should be expected because <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> opportunities embody varying level of restrictiveness. What is interesting is the gap between the coverage and HOI and the differences in these gaps across countries. For example consider difference between coverage and HOI for the same opportunity for two different countries Russia and Albania. In Russia, the penalty is 0.03 while in Albania where the coverage itself is already low, the penalty for inequality is more than twice that for Russia. The fact that Albania does worse than Russia in this particular opportunity is clear enough from the coverage numbers. But a refinement that the HOI brings is that it enables us to see that that Albania would compare even more unfavorably if the distributional aspects of the opportunity were to be taken into account.|$|R

Another component of this thesis involves American GIs and their racialized self-identities.
