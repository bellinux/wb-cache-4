Nowadays, only ceramic breeder materials have been suggested to be tested in the Tritium Release Module located in the Medium Flux Test Module of IFMIF.

40|$|It is {{critical}} {{to be able to}} predict tritium transport in lead-lithium liquid metal (LM) blankets with great accuracy to provide information for fusion reactor safety and economy analyses. However, tritium transport processes are complex and affected by multiple physics such as magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow, yet there is no single computer code capable of simulating these phenomena inclusively. Thus the objectives of this research are: 1) to develop mathematical models and computational codes to quantify both tritium distributions throughout the blanket and the permeation loss rate from LM to helium coolant, and 2) to evaluate the key factors that govern <b>tritium</b> <b>permeation</b> and distribution. To accomplish these objectives, a computational framework for analyzing tritium transport phenomena affected by multi-physics and geometric features has been developed. Models have been proposed to integrate multiple tritium transfer processes, including transport inside the LM MHD flow, transfer across the material interface, and permeation through the structural materials and into the helium coolant. Numerical schemes have been developed and implemented in the code to link the different transport mechanisms. The developed model and code have been validated against the data from the US-JA TITAN experiments on hydrogen transport through an &# 945;-Fe/PbLi system and in-reactor tritium release data from lead-lithium, and the modeling results agree well with the experimental data. Parametric studies are performed to quantify the MHD effects, buoyancy effects, PES effects, and the uncertainties of transport properties. The MHD effects reduce the <b>tritium</b> <b>permeation</b> rate due to the higher velocity near the wall. However, the rate of decrease is reduced at higher Hartmann numbers. The buoyancy effect on tritium transport in the LM MHD flows is revealed. Its tritium inventory drops by 80 %, and the permeation rate drops by 20 % for an upward flow compared to a downward flow. If a PES is introduced on the wall parallel to the magnetic field, tritium loss rate increases by 15 % because the velocity is reduced near the front wall. The range of permeation rate change on the basis of uncertainties of transport properties is also provided, and the effect of the uncertainty of tritium solubility is significant. Furthermore, as the FCI electric conductivity increases from 5 to 500 &# 8486;- 1 m- 1, the <b>tritium</b> <b>permeation</b> rate decreases by 46 % due to the increasing velocity in the gap. Lastly, the difference in <b>tritium</b> <b>permeation</b> rates between dual coolant lead lithium (DCLL) and helium-cooled lead lithium (HCLL) blanket concepts is quantified. The <b>tritium</b> <b>permeation</b> loss percentage from the HCLL concept is about one order of magnitude higher than from the DCLL concept (~ 17 %. vs. 1. 2 %). This is mainly due to a much lower velocity and thus a much higher tritium partial pressure for the HCLL concept. The computational models and results stated in this work provide guidance on the lead-lithium liquid metal blanket designs to comply tritium control requirements with regard to the reduction in <b>tritium</b> <b>permeation</b> and inventory and on planning the experiments for database evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Experiments are {{presented}} investigating {{the action of}} corrosion scales on several steels against hydrogen and <b>tritium</b> <b>permeation.</b> We are interested in such model experiments {{to learn how to}} prevent <b>tritium</b> <b>permeation</b> from the primary circuit of an HTR to the secondary side. The same problem might be of some importance in later fusion reactor technology. Our corrosion scales were formed in a temperature range between 500 ° C and 950 ° C under varying steam hydrogen mixtures. Thickness of the scales was up to several ym. By adequate choice of the "process" parameters we succeeded to produce oxid scales with relativ high reduction factors for hydrogen permeation as compared with the permeation through the blank metal surfaces. Such scales also show a linear correlation between hydrogen pressure and permeation and an increased activation energy for permeation as compared to that of the blank metal. Our observations cast doubt on elder theories trying to explain the action of oxide films. We try here to apply a formalism presented first by Ash and Barrer to describe our findings. According to our experiments we believe that oxide scales formed under the conditions prevailing here act rather as a "dissociationbarrier" than as a "diffusionbarrier". We try {{here for the first time}} to describe the influence of the hydrogen permeation on the <b>tritium</b> <b>permeation</b> of the opposite side, (this is exactly the problem we normally encounter in the case of an HTR for process heat application). Our theoretical explanation shows on the one hand possibilities for producing very high reduction factors e. g. by producing oxide scales on both sides of a heat exchanger tube whereby <b>tritium</b> <b>permeation</b> may be reduced to acceptable levels in a HTR process heat plant, on the other side the models described here, give a sounder base to calculate tritium release in such plants and may be in later fusion reactor blanket configurations...|$|E

The large probing depth of GD-OES (up to 100 s of μm) enables studies not previously accessible to the more conventional techniques for investigating deuterium retention.

40|$|An {{engineering}} scaling {{process is}} applied to the solid breeder ITER TBM designs in accordance with the testing objectives of validating the design tools and the database, and evaluating blanket performance under prototypical operating conditions. The goal of scaling is to ensure that changes in structural response and performance caused by changes in size and operating conditions do not reduce the usefulness of the tests. Initially, constitutive equations are applied to lay out the basic operating and design parameters that dominate blanket phenomena. The suitability of these similarity criteria for the TBM design is then confirmed by comparing finite element predictions of prototype and scale model responses. The TBM design also takes into account the need to check the codes and data for future design use.

This was directly related to the supposed very low tritium solubility in the liquid lead lithium in eutectic composition.

However, total tritium leak within the supposed reactor operation period through the PyC-coated Li compound particles is lower than that through the Al 2 O 3 -coated ones because the hydrogen absorption capacity in PyC is considerably larger than that in Al 2 O 3...|$|E
40|$|Pb 17 Li {{is today}} a {{reference}} breeder material in diverse fusion R&D programs worldwide. One {{of the main}} issues in these programs {{is the problem of}} liquid metals breeder blanket behavior. Structural material of the blanket should meet high requirements because of extreme operating conditions. Therefore the knowledge of eutectic properties like optimal composition, physical and thermodynamic behavior or diffusion coefficients of Tritium are extremely necessary for current designs. In particular, the knowledge of the function linking the tritium concentration dissolved in liquid materials with the tritium partial pressure at a liquid/gas interface in equilibrium, CT=f(PT), is of basic importance because it directly impacts all functional properties of a blanket determining: tritium inventory, <b>tritium</b> <b>permeation</b> rate and tritium extraction efficiency. Nowadays, understanding the structure and behavior of this compound is a real goal in fusion engineering and materials science. Simulations of liquids can provide much information to the community; not only supplementing experimental data, but providing new tests of theories and ideas, making specific predictions that require experimental tests, and ultimately helping to lead to the deeper understanding and better predictive behavior...|$|E
40|$|Available {{data and}} {{mathematical}} formulations concerning tritium transport in the FW/Divertor with tungsten and beryllium as plasma facing materials were {{implemented in the}} commercial code COMSOL Multiphysics. The goal {{is to develop a}} CAD-based multiphysics modeling capability so that FW/Divertor temperature and geometric features can be readily taken into consideration while <b>tritium</b> <b>permeation</b> to the primary coolant in a prototypical PFC can be more realistically addressed. This development began with the simulation of ion implantation experiments, validated against existing laboratory experimental results. Analysis shows that with ITER FW where Be is used as the plasma facing material, the low operating temperature, erosion, and the dwell time greatly hinder tritium bulk diffusion, permeation, and inventory accumulation. However, under DEMO high-temperature operating conditions, tritium can quickly diffuse through tungsten to structural material and reach a steady state inventory after a relatively short time. Additionally, its permeation to the coolant can be reduced when the Soret effect is considered. The findings and challenges of developing a 3 -D predictive capability for tritium transport in a FW/Divertor PFC are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{experimental}} investigation of <b>tritium</b> <b>permeation</b> in flibe (2 LiF-BeF 2) at the Safety and Tritium Applied Research facility of the Idaho National Laboratory. A stainless steel cell formed by two independent volumes separated by a 2 mm thick nickel membrane is maintained at temperatures between 500 and 700 degrees Celsius. A controlled amount of T 2 gas is flown in excess of argon in the source volume {{in contact with the}} bottom side of the nickel membrane, while a layer of molten salt is in contact with the top side. The tritium permeating above the liquid surface is carried by an argon flow to a diagnostic system comprised of a quadrupole mass spectrometer, a gas chromatographer and a proportional counter. Tritium permeability in flibe as a function of temperature is determined by the measured permeation flow rates reached in steady-state conditions, while the diffusivity is determined by fitting the transient process with the analytical solution for the diffusion process. As a result, the solubility of tritium in flibe as a function of temperature is also determined...|$|E
