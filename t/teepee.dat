He knocked the pistol upward as No Water fired, {{deflecting}} the bullet to Crazy Horse's upper jaw. No Water left, with Crazy Horse's relatives in hot pursuit. No Water ran his horse until it died and continued on foot until he reached the safety of his own village.|$|E

25|$|The Plains Indians are an {{archetype}} in art {{and literature}} for all Native Americans. Initially, some Plains Indian tribes were agrarian and others were hunter-gatherers. Some tribes used the dog as a draft animal to pull small travois (or sleighs) to help move from place to place. However, in the 18th century most plains tribes adopted the horse culture and became nomadic. The tipi (also tepee and <b>teepee,</b> {{and not to be}} confused with the wigwam of the tribes of the Northeast and the West) was used by Plains Indians as a dwelling because they were portable and could be reconstructed quickly when the tribe settled in a new area for hunting or a pow wow (a periodic gathering of medicine men and/or spiritual leaders).|$|E

Pasquinel and his new bride Lise set up a proper household in St. Louis, but the fur trader feels out of place with the aristocratic society in which she lives. The citizens of St. Louis regard Indians as inferior, and hold {{that they must be}} assimilated into the white world, a view opposed by the more knowledgeable voyageur. He and McKeag eventually pack up and head westward to Lame Beaver's village. In the meantime, Lame Beaver leads his braves in a raid against the Pawnee, killing their chief using one of the golden bullets. But the Pawnee soon rally and the brave Arapaho is slain. Clay Basket is devastated when, with her widowed mother forsaken and her own fiance Pasquinel gone, the rest of the tribe ransacks their <b>teepee.</b> The old woman has to live out in the cold because no male family member is around to take her in.|$|E
500|$|The Bonfire design {{changed in}} 1942. Universal Studios, filming the movie We've Never Been Licked on the Texas A Campus, built a bonfire as a prop for the movie. Their {{structure}} used a design {{similar to a}} <b>teepee,</b> where all the logs rested {{against each other in}} a conical shape. The logs were placed at an angle between 23 and 30degrees, giving it [...] "a tremendous vertical and horizontal resistance". This allowed Bonfire to grow from [...] tall to over [...] tall.

500|$|The Huffington Post {{wrote that}} [...] "the video {{is a dream}} within a story {{involving}} a little girl, a <b>teepee</b> and a few deaths. Cool!

[...] The Smoking Section commented, [...] "he premise might sound out there, until you watch for yourself and your assumptions become trumped by the visually and mentally stimulating succession of supernatural events." [...] Prefix Magazine gave the video a positive review, writing [...] "the vid sets Ocean's doe-eyed crooning against something of an inter-dimensional love story, that or a dreamcatcher-inspired fever dream.

500|$|In 1978, Bonfire {{shifted from}} its {{previous}} <b>teepee</b> design to a wedding cake style, in which upper stacks of logs were wedged {{on top of}} lower stacks. The structure was built around a fortified center pole, made from two telephone poles spliced together by cutting matching notches, approximately [...] long, and with [...] of glue. Four steel plates were bolted to the two poles, and a [...] cable wrapped around the joint and secured to the pole with steel staples. Four perimeter poles were placed [...] away and ropes were stretched between the perimeter poles to center poles and tension placed on them to hold the center pole together. After the center pole was erected, logs were placed vertically around it in a multi-tiered wedding cake design composed of thousands of logs. By 1984, the logs were sloping only 14degrees. The spiral arrangement of the logs was designed to make Bonfire collapse into itself in a twisting motion, thus protecting spectators. Although the tradition stated that if Bonfire burned through midnight then A would win the following day's football game, {{the introduction of the}} wedding cake design drastically reduced the time it took for Bonfire to fall, sometimes burning for only 30 or 45minutes.|$|E
