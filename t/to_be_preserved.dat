5|$|The {{residents}} of Milwaukee Avenue {{and the surrounding}} Seward neighborhood formed the Seward West Project Area Committee (PAC) {{in order to try}} to save the Milwaukee Avenue homes.

5|$|Between 1800 and 1814, a dog named Barry {{lived as}} a rescue dog at the hospice, and was famous enough {{at the time}} for his body <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>preserved</b> at the Natural History Museum of Bern.

5|$|King George Vs active naval {{career was}} {{terminated}} by the Royal Navy in June 1950, {{when she and}} her sister-ships went into reserve and were mothballed. King George V was the first large warship <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>preserved</b> in this fashion. This involved sealing the armament, machinery and boilers against damp and installing dehumidifiers throughout. In December 1955, she was downgraded to extended reserve and in 1957 the decision was taken to scrap the four ships. The following year King George V was moved from her berth in Gareloch to the ship breaking firm of Arnott Young and Co. in Dalmuir to undergo dismantling.|$|E
5|$|On 14 December 2009 the US Navy officially {{transferred}} Wisconsin to {{the city}} of Norfolk, ending the requirement for the ship <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>preserved</b> for possible recall to active duty. The US Navy had paid the city of Norfolk $2.8million between 2000 and 2009 to maintain the ship. A formal ceremony transferring the ship {{to the city}} of Norfolk took place on 16 April 2010. Wisconsin was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 28 March 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} for starfish is ancient, {{dating back to}} the Ordovician around 450 million years ago, but it is rather poor, as starfish tend to {{disintegrate}} after death. Only the ossicles and spines of the animal are likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>preserved,</b> making remains hard to locate. With their appealing symmetrical shape, starfish have played a part in literature, legend, design and popular culture. They are sometimes collected as curios, used in design or as logos, and in some cultures, despite possible toxicity, they are eaten.|$|E

5|$|The {{legislative}} {{intent of}} the National Recording Preservation Act of 2000 {{was to develop a}} national program to guard America's sound recording heritage. The Act resulted in the formations of the National Recording Registry, The National Recording Preservation Board and a fund-raising foundation to aid their efforts. The act established the Registry specifically for the purpose of maintaining and preserving sound recordings and collections of sound recordings that are culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant. Beginning in 2002, the National Recording Preservation Board began selecting nominated recordings each year <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>preserved.</b>|$|E

5|$|Most known Albertosaurus {{individuals}} were aged 14 {{years or more}} {{at the time of}} death. Juvenile animals are rarely found as fossils for several reasons, mainly preservation bias, where the smaller bones of younger animals were less likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>preserved</b> by fossilization than the larger bones of adults, and collection bias, where smaller fossils {{are less likely to be}} noticed by collectors in the field. Young Albertosaurus are relatively large for juvenile animals, but their remains are still rare in the fossil record compared with adults. It has been suggested that this phenomenon is a consequence of life history, rather than bias, and that fossils of juvenile Albertosaurus are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did.|$|E

5|$|Relative of the Rowan family, Stephen Collins Foster, {{occasionally}} visited Federal Hill {{according to}} letters penned by Stephen's brother Morrison Foster. Stephen {{was inspired by}} the imagery witnessed at Federal Hill and by Harriet Beecher Stowe's anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom's Cabin to write his ballad My Old Kentucky Home. The mansion remained in the possession of Rowan's family until 1922, when his granddaughter, Madge (Rowan) Frost, sold it to the state of Kentucky <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>preserved</b> as a state shrine. Today, it is a part of My Old Kentucky Home State Park in Bardstown. In 1856, the Kentucky General Assembly created a new county from parts of Fleming and Morgan counties and named it Rowan County in Rowan's honor.|$|E
5|$|The state {{government}} {{made the decision}} to decommission Fremantle Prison in 1983, but it remained in operation until 30 November 1991. Prisoners were moved to a new metropolitan maximum security prison at Casuarina and the prison was transferred to the Building Management Authority. There were divergent views in the community over the site's future: some wanted it demolished and redeveloped, or turned into gardens with a small monument; others wanted the historic site <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>preserved,</b> but were opposed to turning the misery of prisoners into entertainment for tourists. The ultimate decision was for conservation of the prison, but allowing for the buildings to be adapted for reuse by the community.|$|E
5|$|The {{superfamily}} Rhinocerotoidea, {{which includes}} modern rhinoceroses, {{can be traced}} back to the early Eoceneabout 50 million years agowith early precursors such as Hyrachyus. Rhinocerotoidea contains three families; Amynodontidae, Rhinocerotidae ("true rhinoceroses"), and Hyracodontidae. The diversity within the rhinoceros group was much larger in prehistoric times; they ranged from dog-sized to the size of Paraceratherium. There were long-legged, cursorial forms adapted for running and squat, semi aquatic forms. Most species did not have horns. Rhinoceros fossils are identified as such mainly by characteristics of their teeth, which is the part of the animals most likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>preserved.</b> The upper molars of most rhinoceroses have a pi-shaped (π) pattern on the crown, and each lower molar has paired L-shapes. Various skull features are also used for identification of fossil rhinoceroses.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most of {{the other}} ironclads of the Ottoman fleet, the four Osmaniye-class ships were kept out of action during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, since they were among the largest and most {{powerful}} vessels of the fleet and the high command decided they ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>preserved.</b> As a result, they generally remained safely in the Sea of Marmara, though Osmaniye was briefly used as a troop transport in the Mediterranean Sea. The four ships were reduced to reserve status in Constantinople after the war, {{with the rest of the}} Ottoman fleet. The four ships were heavily rebuilt in the early 1890s, being converted into more modern barbette ships. Nevertheless, they were in poor condition by the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, with many of their guns damaged or incomplete. Training exercises conducted in May highlighted the very low standard of training of their crews, and reinforced the decision not to confront the Greek Navy at sea.|$|E
5|$|All five forts {{and three}} battery positionsLeåkersberget, Norra Åberget and Södra Slumpbergetwere {{declared}} historic {{buildings in the}} summer of 1998 and are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>preserved</b> for the future. The balloon hangar, the only of its kind in Sweden, was declared a historic building three years later in 2001. Two forts, Rödberget and Södra Åberget, are held in operation, and the former is used as a tourist attraction with guided tours, and there is also a possibility for companies to hold smaller conferences inside the fort. Over 10,000 visitors were expected to visit Rödberget Fort in 2002, averaging 300 a day during the summer. Boden Fortress is also still one of the salute batteries of Sweden, which fire a 21-gun salute at special occasions such as the National holiday of Sweden and birthdays of some members of the Swedish Royal Family. The fortress was made a salute battery on 2 June 1931, but since the forts have been decommissioned, the salute is now fired with four cannon located at Kvarnängen in central Boden.|$|E
5|$|Boden Fortress {{is made up}} of five primary {{self-supporting}} forts excavated out of {{the bedrock}} in five of the mountains surrounding Boden: Degerberget, Mjösjöberget, Gammelängsberget, Södra Åberget and Rödberget. Eight fortified secondary artillery positions were constructed between the forts to give flanking support and to cover areas not in range of the main forts' artillery. In addition, 40 bunkers for infantry, along with dugouts and other fortifications, were built to cover even more terrain. During the Second World War anti-tank gun emplacements and additional bunkers and shelters were built, and tens of kilometres of dragon's teeth were placed around the fortress and the city itself. Owing {{to the end of the}} Cold War and the reduction of the threat from the Soviet Union, Boden Fortress became less important to the defence of Sweden, and began to be decommissioned. The last fort of the complex was decommissioned on 31 December 1998, and is now used as a tourist attraction. All five forts as well as some of the supporting structures have been declared historic buildings, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>preserved</b> for the future, by the Swedish government.|$|E
