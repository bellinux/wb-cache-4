5|$|Individuals {{living in}} large groups may be safer from attack because <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> may be {{confused}} by the large group size. As the group moves, <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues {{as an example of}} this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse <b>the</b> <b>predator,</b> making it harder for <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of <b>the</b> <b>predator.</b>|$|E
5|$|The prey {{does not}} have to be {{attracted}} towards <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> for <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> to benefit: it is sufficient for <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> simply not to be identified as a threat. Wicklerian-Eisnerian mimics may resemble a mutualistic ally, or a species of little significance to the prey such as a commensal. For example, the spider Arachnocoris berytoides resembles Faiditus caudatus, a spider commensal of ants.|$|E
5|$|Jughead regroups {{with his}} {{remaining}} friends. Some {{members of the}} group decide to split up in hopes <b>the</b> <b>Predator</b> will continue to pursue Veronica, allowing them to escape. Dilton Doily, Archie, Betty, and Jughead stay behind with Veronica. When <b>the</b> <b>Predator</b> attacks again, it kills Dilton and Jughead and critically wounds Archie. Betty and Veronica take refuge at Lodge Manor, where they hook Archie to an experimental healing machine. Archie is killed and Veronica is knocked unconscious when <b>the</b> <b>Predator</b> breaks their barricade. During a struggle, Betty's left hand is cut off, causing <b>the</b> <b>Predator</b> to show regret since it was motivated by a crush on Betty. She uses the opportunity to wound <b>the</b> <b>Predator.</b> Veronica awakens to find Betty using the face and body reconstruction system on the healing machine to transform the wounded Predator into Archie.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the Volterra ecosystem driven by correlated noises. The competition of <b>the</b> <b>predators</b> induces an increasing in population density of <b>the</b> <b>predators.</b> <b>The</b> competition of the preys, however, leads <b>the</b> <b>predators</b> to decay. <b>The</b> <b>predators</b> may have better stability under strong correlated noises. <b>The</b> <b>predators</b> undergo a sensitivity to a random environment, whereas the preys exhibit a surprising endurance to this stochasticity.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Predators</b> were {{involved}} in some controversy {{when it was announced}} that Alexander Radulov would make his return to <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> after leaving for the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) in 2008.

5|$|Mimesis or cryptic {{aggressive}} mimicry {{is where}} <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> mimics an organism that its prey is indifferent to. Unlike {{in all cases}} above, <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> is ignored by the prey, allowing it to avoid detection until the prey are close enough for <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> to strike. This is effectively a form of camouflage. The zone-tailed hawk (Buteo albonotatus), which resembles the turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), may provide one such example. It flies amongst them, suddenly breaking from the formation and ambushing its prey. Here the hawk's presence is of no evident significance to the vultures, affecting them neither negatively or positively. There is some controversy over {{whether this is a}} true case of mimicry.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Predator</b> {{travels through}} {{rural and urban}} areas of Gunnison, {{fighting}} more Aliens along the way, and occasionally being harassed by human soldiers and civilians. Finally, the main Alien lair is found in a hospital, where several mines are set by <b>the</b> <b>Predator</b> to bring the Hive down. The game concludes with the final fight against an attacking helicopter and the hospital's destruction. Suddenly, the Alien Queen is seen appearing out of the hospital's rubble, only to be destroyed, along with the entire town, by a nuclear warhead, while <b>the</b> <b>Predator</b> successfully leaves Earth.|$|E
5|$|When Archie and {{his friends}} take a spring break trip to Los Perdidos Resort, an alien, trophy-hunting Predator touches down in a nearby jungle. Betty discovers an ancient Colombian shrine and attracts the {{attention}} of <b>the</b> <b>Predator,</b> who follows her home to Riverdale. Targeting Veronica, <b>the</b> <b>Predator</b> attacks and kills several people who are armed with weapons. Kevin Keller, an acquaintance with military experience, organizes and protects Archie {{and his friends}}. The creature's picture is taken by Betty, who shows it to Kevin's father, a US Military General. He identifies it as a teenager from a race of nearly unstoppable alien hunters. Jughead Jones is used as bait to lure <b>the</b> <b>Predator,</b> but the trap fails and <b>the</b> <b>Predator</b> kills {{the majority of the}} youths present.|$|E

5|$|Following {{in a long}} {{tradition}} of all-American teenager Archie Andrews meeting unusual celebrities and pop culture icons, this comic book shows him meeting the galaxy's deadliest hunter, <b>the</b> <b>Predator.</b> The idea was first suggested in the Archie office and then proposed to Dark Horse, who holds the license to comics featuring <b>the</b> <b>Predator</b> character owned by 20th Century Fox. The companies paired de Campi, a horror writer at Dark Horse, with Ruiz, a regular Archie artist. When the comic book was announced, many media outlets noted in their headlines that the new title was not a joke.|$|E
5|$|Luring {{is not a}} {{necessary}} condition however, as <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> still has a significant advantage simply by not being identified as such. They may resemble a mutualistic symbiont or a species of little relevance to the prey.|$|E
5|$|Once aposematic {{individuals}} reach {{a certain}} threshold population, for whatever reason, <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> learning process would be {{spread out over}} {{a larger number of}} individuals and therefore is less likely to wipe out the trait for warning colouration completely. If the population of aposematic individuals all originated from the same few individuals, <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> learning process would result in a stronger warning signal for surviving kin, resulting in higher inclusive fitness for the dead or injured individuals through kin selection.|$|E
50|$|On August 1, 2013, Simons was {{assigned}} to <b>the</b> Orlando <b>Predators</b> of <b>the</b> Arena Football League after a 4-year break from football. Simons {{was assigned}} as an offensive lineman for <b>the</b> <b>Predators,</b> but his 4.9 second 40-yard dash time at <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> tryout made him an option for use at fullback. Simons ran for 64 yards on 25 carries for 6 touchdowns as a rookie.

5|$|Predators {{of adult}} sparrows include house cats and small raptors like Cooper's and sharp-shinned hawks, American kestrels, and white-tailed kites. The nests may be raided by {{a range of}} species {{including}} mammals and reptiles such as snakes, though nest predation {{has not yet been}} directly observed, and nesting sparrows have been observed using three kinds of displays to distract potential predators; the rodent run, the broken wing, and the tumbling off the bush. Birds adopt a rodent run display to distract predators. The head, neck and tail are lowered, wings held out, and feathers fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call. In the broken wing display, the sparrow imitates having a broken wing by dropping one to the ground and hopping away from the nest with one wing dragging, leading <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> away until the bird ceases the act and escapes <b>the</b> <b>predator.</b> The adult rufous-crowned sparrow distracts a nest predator by falling from the top of a bush to attract <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> to itself in the tumbling off the bush display.|$|E
5|$|Some {{animals are}} capable of {{autotomy}} (self-amputation), shedding {{one of their own}} appendages in a last-ditch attempt to elude a predator's grasp or to distract <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> and thereby allow escape. The lost body part may be regenerated later. Certain sea slugs discard stinging papillae; arthropods such as crabs can sacrifice a claw, which can be regrown over several successive moults; among vertebrates, many geckos and other lizards shed their tails when attacked: the tail goes on writhing for a while, distracting <b>the</b> <b>predator,</b> and giving the lizard time to escape; a smaller tail slowly regrows.|$|E
5|$|The defence {{mechanism}} {{relies on the}} memory of the would-be predator; a bird that has once experienced a foul-tasting grasshopper will endeavour to avoid a repetition of the experience. As a consequence, aposematic species are often gregarious. Before the memory of a bad experience attenuates, <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> may have the experience reinforced through repetition. Aposematic organisms often move in a languid fashion, as they have little need for speed and agility. Instead, their morphology is frequently tough and resistant to injury, thereby allowing them to escape once <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> is warned off.|$|E
25|$|On February 2 in Nashville, Arvidsson and Johansen scored for <b>the</b> <b>Predators,</b> and Rinne put up 31 saves to {{earn his}} second shutout of the season to lead <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> to their seventh–straight win over the Edmonton Oilers. Two nights later, <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> fell 1–0 to the Detroit Red Wings.|$|R
50|$|After {{trailing}} 2-1 in {{the second}} period, <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> opened their playoff run with a 3-2 victory over <b>the</b> Ducks. <b>The</b> <b>Predators</b> took a 2-0 lead in the series with a 3-2 victory over the Ducks. Back home in Nashville for Game 3, <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> were shut out in a 3-0 loss and the Ducks pushed the series to 2-1. The Ducks evened the series in a 4-1 victory in Game 4. The Ducks pulled to a one-game lead over <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> with a 5-2 victory in Game 5. Back in Nashville for Game 6, <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> kept <b>the</b> series alive with a 3-1 victory over <b>the</b> Ducks. <b>The</b> <b>Predators</b> scored two goals {{in the first period}} and held off a late rally by the Ducks to win Game 7 2-1 and advance on to the Western Conference semifinals.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{scoring the}} first goal, <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> fell 5-2 to the Sharks in Game 1 {{of the second}} round. <b>The</b> <b>Predators</b> fell to a two-game deficit in a 3-2 loss to the Sharks in Game 2. After {{allowing}} a power play goal {{in the first period}}, <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> scored four unanswered goals - including two on power plays - to take Game 3. A third overtime goal by Mike Fisher gave <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> a 4-3 victory in Game 4 and evened the series at two games a piece. <b>The</b> <b>Predators</b> fell 5-1 to the Sharks in Game 5. Despite trailing two goals in the first period of Game 6, <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> rallied back to tie the game in the third period and score the winning goal in overtime to force a Game 7, which they lost 5-0.|$|R
5|$|The {{first line}} of defence {{consists}} in avoiding detection, through mechanisms such as camouflage, living underground, or nocturnality. Alternatively, prey animals may ward off attack, whether by advertising the presence of strong defences in aposematism, by mimicking animals which do possess such defences, by startling the attacker, by signalling to <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> that pursuit is not worthwhile, by distraction, by using defensive structures such as spines, and by living in a group. Members of groups are at reduced risk of predation, despite the increased conspicuousness of a group, through improved vigilance, predator confusion, and the likelihood that <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> will attack some other individual.|$|E
5|$|White-tailed {{deer and}} other prey mammals flag with {{conspicuous}} (often black and white) tail markings when alarmed, informing <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> {{that it has}} been detected.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive {{resemblance}} {{is used by}} predators or parasites. In special aggressive resemblance, {{the animal}} looks like something else, luring the prey or host to approach, for example when a flower mantis resembles {{a particular kind of}} flower, such as an orchid. In general aggressive resemblance, <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> or parasite blends in with the background, for example when a leopard is hard to see in long grass.|$|E
50|$|In the {{expansion}} draft, <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> chose five goaltenders, including Mike Dunham and Tomas Vokoun, {{who would become}} their starting goaltenders, and Mike Richter, who was a free agent and chose not to sign with <b>the</b> <b>Predators.</b> In <b>the</b> 1998 NHL Entry Draft, <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> chose David Legwand, a center, as their first-ever draft pick, second overall.|$|R
50|$|It {{was a very}} {{successful}} season for <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> on-and off-the-ice. <b>The</b> <b>Predators</b> racked up 16 regular season sell-outs and an additional six sell-outs during the playoffs.|$|R
