5|$|On August 27, 2013, Hickenlooper {{asked the}} Colorado Supreme Court to clarify if a voter had {{to vote for}} recall in order <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{replacement}} candidate. At the same time, Libertarian Jan Brooks turned in petitions {{to be on the}} ballot against Morse while Democrat Richard Anglund announced his write-in candidacy against Giron. On August 28, the Supreme Court ruled that a voter did not have to vote to recall in order <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> replacement, but that the Senators could only be recalled by a majority vote. Secretary of State Gessler announced that Brooks did not have sufficient signatures to qualify for the ballot, leaving only Republican opponents on the ballot.|$|E
5|$|On June 15, Paul {{told reporters}} {{that he was willing}} <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> partial repeal, but not the {{implementation}} of new Republican entitlement programs, which he identified as present in both House and Senate versions of the bill.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the desire}} of silver delegates to {{nominate}} a candidate who shared their beliefs, and although several states instructed their delegates <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> specific candidate, there was no overwhelming favorite for the nomination going into the convention. With a two-thirds vote of the delegates needed to nominate, almost every silver delegate would have {{to vote for the}} same candidate to assure success, though any organized support from gold delegates would greatly damage a silver candidate's chances.|$|E

50|$|A Gallup Poll {{released}} in 2007 indicated that 53% of Americans would refuse <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> atheist as president, up from 48% in 1987 and 1999. Research shows that candidates that {{are perceived to}} be religious are considered more trustworthy.|$|R
5|$|According to {{the tally}} of Cardinal Charles de Lorraine-Guise {{in his letter}} to Henry II, once the twelve {{participating}} French cardinals reached Rome, twenty-three cardinals were aligned in the French faction, twenty-two in the Imperial faction, and four neutral; thus Guise judged it impossible for either faction to garner the necessary two-thirds simply by persuading neutral cardinals. In addition, eleven Italian cardinals whom Guise counted among the French faction were only likely <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fellow Italian, making the three favorites of Henry IILouis de Bourbon de Vendôme, Jean de Lorraine, and Georges d'Amboiseunfeasible. The non-French cardinal protector of France, d'Este, would then have been the choice of Henry II; Catherine de' Medici preferred her cousin Giovanni Salviati, who was extremely unacceptable to the Imperial faction and the Farnese.|$|E
5|$|Because Poe {{was found}} on the day of an election, it was {{suggested}} as early as 1872 that he was the victim of cooping. This was a ballot-box-stuffing scam in which victims were shanghaied, drugged, and used as a pawn <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> political party at multiple locations. Cooping had become the standard explanation for Poe's death in most of his biographies for several decades, though his status in Baltimore may have made him too recognizable for this scam to have worked. More recently, analysis suggesting that Poe's death resulted from rabies has been presented.|$|E
5|$|Other {{candidates}} {{being considered}} for the position included National League president Ford Frick, Democratic National Committee chairman Robert E. Hannegan, former Postmaster General James Farley, US Senator John W. Bricker, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, former federal judge Fred M. Vinson, Ohio Governor Frank Lausche, and Undersecretary of War Robert P. Patterson. After Cincinnati Reds owner Warren Giles and Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley raised strong opposition to Frick, formerly the front runner, New York Yankees co-owner Larry MacPhail began to advocate for Chandler. When the owners met in Cleveland, Ohio on April 24, 1945 <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new commissioner, Chandler's name {{was not on the}} short list; the candidates were Frick, Farley, Hannegan, Vinson, Lausche, and Patterson. None of the candidates received the required two-thirds majority, and after lobbying by MacPhail and New York Giants owner Horace Stoneham, the owners took an informal vote to see if anyone had the potential to be elected. Chandler's name appeared in the top three on each of the sixteen ballots. Encouraged, the owners then held another formal vote. After two ballots, Chandler received the necessary majority; a third vote was taken to make the choice unanimous.|$|E

50|$|The 1921 {{by-election}} {{had shown}} a willingness among the mass Unionist electorate <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> unofficial candidate.

5|$|The {{conversion}} of the Archbishop of Cologne to Protestantism triggered religious and political repercussions throughout the Holy Roman Empire. His conversion had widespread implications {{for the future of}} the Holy Roman Empire's electoral process established by the Golden Bull of 1356. In this process, seven Imperial Electors—the four secular electors of Bohemia, Brandenburg, the Palatinate, and Saxony; and the three ecclesiastical electors of Mainz, Trier, and Cologne—selected an emperor. The presence of at least three inherently Catholic electors, who collectively governed some of the most prosperous ecclesiastical territories in the Empire, guaranteed the delicate balance of Catholics and Protestants in the voting; only one other elector needed <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Catholic candidate, ensuring that future emperors would remain in the so-called Old Faith. The possibility of one of those electors shifting to the Protestant side, and of that elector producing an heir to perpetuate this shift, would change the balance in the electoral college in favor of the Protestants.|$|E
5|$|This tactic did {{not prove}} successful: pro-Nazi {{propaganda}} and protests were rampant, {{even among the}} Lithuanian population, and the local government was powerless to prevent them. The Nazis physically harassed Lithuanian organizations. On 1 November 1938 Lithuania was pressured into lifting martial law and press censorship. During the December elections to the Klaipėda Parliament, pro-German parties received 87% of votes (25 seats out of 29) in the Klaipėda territory. Dr. Ernst Neumann, the chief defendant in the 1934 trials, {{was released from prison}} in February 1938 and became the leader of Klaipėda's pro-German movement. In December he was received by Adolf Hitler, who assured him that the Klaipėda issue would be resolved by March or April 1939. Neumann and other Nazi activists claimed the right of self-determination for the region and demanded that Lithuania open negotiations over the political status of Klaipėda. The parliament was expected <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> return to Germany when it convened on 25 March 1939. Germany's official channels maintained silence on the issue. Germany hoped that Lithuania would voluntarily give up the troubled region, and a public stance could have disturbed the sensitive discussions it was then engaged in with Poland over an anti-Communist alliance against the Soviet Union.|$|E

On the other hand, a survey of sociology professors found that one quarter stated that they would be more likely <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> hiring <b>a</b> declared Democrat and less likely <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> hiring <b>a</b> declared Republican. Around 40% stated that they would be less likely <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> hiring <b>an</b> Evangelical or a member of the National Rifle Association. Another survey found <b>a</b> similar situation <b>for</b> humanities and other social sciences professors.|$|R

The answer is that it is much harder <b>for</b> them <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> ex-post efficient institution compared to a homogenous group studied in the literature. Driven by self-interest, players vote defensively and attempt to avoid possible punishment that might target at themselves. ...|$|R
