5|$|In the 12 {{previous}} matches {{between the}} two sides – four Test matches and eight ODIs – England had a 100% winning record against Bangladesh, the only international team able <b>to</b> <b>boast</b> such a record. The previous year, Bangladesh had claimed their first Test series victory against a senior Test nation, though it came against a West Indies side that was heavily weakened because of an industrial dispute. England came into the tour {{on the back of a}} two-and-a-half-month series against South Africa in which they had tied the Test and Twenty20 International series, and secured a 2–1 ODI series win.|$|E

In this capacity, he surveyed and claimed significant additional tracts of land, becoming one of Kentucky's most wealthy citizens. According to tradition, Marshall was known <b>to</b> <b>boast</b> that he could ride from Frankfort to Versailles, a distance of some , and never enter a tract of land that he didn't own. He was also supposed to have boasted that he measured his silver coinage by the peck, not having time to count the individual coins.|$|E
5|$|Scholar William Luis observes {{a strong}} {{resemblance}} between {{the structure of}} Julia Alvarez’s How the García Girls Lost Their Accents and Alejo Carpentier's Viaje a la Semilla as both employ the tactic of backwards narration and consequently lay claim to two beginnings and two endings. Alvarez has also been said to follow the stylistic traditions established by novels such as Pedro Juan Labarthe's The Son of Two Nations: The Private Life of a Columbia Student (1931), Marcio Veloz Maggiolo's El prófugo (1962), Humberto Cintrón's Frankie Cristo (1972), and Richard Ruiz's The Hungry American (1978). Despite the overtly North American stylistic qualities the book appears <b>to</b> <b>boast</b> at first glance, each of the aforementioned authors are of Hispanic descent.|$|E

5|$|The Americans {{authorities}} apparently appreciated Vizzini, {{because he}} had opposed the Fascists and yielded substantial political power on the island. As far as Vizzini was concerned, he liked <b>to</b> <b>boast</b> about his excellent contacts with the Americans, and underlined {{their support for the}} separatist movement. Vizzini would become an important player {{in the midst of the}} separatist crisis later on. The Americans seem to have treated Vizzini as the Mafia’s overall boss. The OSS relied on the Mafia, and in particular on Vizzini, for its intelligence. His codename was ‘Bull Frog’ in secret communications. For a while, the chief of the OSS Palermo office, Joseph Russo, met him and other Mafia bosses ‘at least once a month’.|$|E
5|$|The {{moral code}} {{embedded}} in Aboriginal lore {{is evident in}} a story from an unspecified locality in eastern Australia (probably in New South Wales) published in 1943. An Aboriginal man, fishing in a lagoon, caught a baby bunyip. Instead of returning the baby to the water, {{he wanted to take}} the bunyip back to the camp <b>to</b> <b>boast</b> of his fishing prowess, against the urging of his friends. Before he could do anything, the mother bunyip rose from the water, flooding swirling water around them, and took back her baby. As the water receded, the men found that they had been changed into black swans. As punishment for the fisherman's vanity, they never regained their human form, but could be heard at night talking in human voices as a reminder to their human relatives of the perils of pride and arrogance.|$|E
5|$|A host treated his {{retainers}} {{very well}} and showered them with luxury gifts if he wanted <b>to</b> <b>boast</b> his wealth and status. One retainer even received a sword scabbard decorated with jade and pearls, while others were given items like shoes decorated with pearls. However, not all retainers shared the same status, as those showered with gifts often provided highly skilled work or greater services; retainers who were not as skilled were given lesser gifts and seated in less honorable positions when meeting the host. Regardless of status, any retainer was allowed {{to come and go}} from his host's residence as he or she pleased, unlike a slave who was the property of his master and permanently attached to the estate. There was no official government policy {{on how to deal with}} retainers, but when they broke laws they were arrested, and when their master broke the law, sometimes the retainers were detained alongside him.|$|E

5|$|Steph was {{introduced}} as Zara Morgan's (Kelly Greenwood) bitchy friend with {{a penchant for}} humiliating and bullying others. She was touted as a new student for Hollyoaks High and was the first character from the Dean family to be introduced into the series. Over time the character was joined by an on-screen family. She was not initially particularly close to her brothers and sister, although for many years she tried to maintain a relationship with them. Generally, her mother Frankie never had much time for Steph or her life, usually preferring to involve herself in the lives of Steph's brothers, Craig and Jake, or <b>to</b> <b>boast</b> about her daughter Debbie's professional singing prowess; in contrast Steph had a very close relationship with her father Johnno, who continually supported the family through a number of tough times over the years; however, Steph was hit very hard when he left Hollyoaks in 2005 after discovering that he had an illegitimate baby son.|$|E
