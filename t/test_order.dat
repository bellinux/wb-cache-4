40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} GPs' <b>test</b> <b>ordering</b> behaviour, and to establish professional and context-related determinants of GPs' inclination to <b>order</b> <b>tests.</b> METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was carried out of 229 GPs in 40 local GP groups from five regions in The Netherlands of the combined number of 19 laboratory and eight imaging <b>tests</b> <b>ordered</b> by GPs, collected from five regional diagnostic centres. In a multivariable multilevel regression analysis, these data were linked with survey data on professional characteristics such as knowledge about and attitude towards <b>test</b> <b>ordering,</b> and with data on context-related factors such as practice type or experience with feedback on <b>test</b> <b>ordering</b> data. The main outcome measure was the percentage point differences associated with professional and context-related factors. RESULTS: The total median number of tests per GP per year was 998 (interquartile range 663 - 1500), with significant differences between the regions. The response to the survey was 97 %. At the professional level, 'individual involvement in developing guidelines' (yes versus no), and at the context-related level 'group practice' (versus single-handed and two-person practices) and 'more than 1 year of experience working with a problem-oriented laboratory order form' (yes versus no) were associated with 27, 18 and 41 % lower numbers of <b>tests</b> <b>ordered,</b> respectively.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of an educational intervention on test-ordering attitudes and intended practice of GP trainees, and any associations between changes in <b>test</b> <b>ordering</b> and trainee characteristics. Design: Preworkshop and postworkshop survey of attitudes to <b>test</b> <b>ordering,</b> intended test-ordering practices for 3 clinical scenarios (fatigue, screening, and shoulder pain), and tolerance for uncertainty. Setting: Three Australian regional general practice training providers. Participants: General practice trainees (N = 167). Intervention: A 2 -hour workshop session and an online module. Main outcome measures: Proportion of trainees who agreed with attitudinal statements {{before and after the}} workshop; proportion of trainees who would <b>order</b> <b>tests,</b> mean number of <b>tests</b> <b>ordered,</b> and number of appropriate and inappropriate <b>tests</b> <b>ordered</b> for each scenario before and after the workshop. Results: Of 167 trainees, 132 (79. 0 %) completed both the preworkshop and postworkshop questionnaires. A total of 122 trainees attended the workshop. At baseline, 88. 6 % thought that tests can harm patients, 84. 8 % believed overtesting was a problem, 72. 0 % felt pressured by patients, 52. 3 % believed that tests would reassure patients, and 50. 8 % thought that they {{were less likely to be}} sued if they <b>ordered</b> <b>tests.</b> There were desirable changes in all attitudes after the workshop. Before the workshop, the mean number of tests that trainees would have ordered was 4. 4, 4. 8, and 1. 5 for the fatigue, screening, and shoulder pain scenarios, respectively. After the workshop there were decreases in the mean number of both appropriate tests (decrease of 0. 94) and inappropriate tests (decrease of 0. 24) in the fatigue scenario; there was no change in the mean number of appropriate tests and a decrease in inappropriate tests (decrease of 0. 76) in the screening scenario; and there was an increase in the proportion of trainees who would appropriately not <b>order</b> <b>tests</b> in the shoulder pain scenario. There were no significant associations between changes in <b>test</b> <b>ordering</b> and trainee demographic characteristics or tolerance for uncertainty subscale scores.

40|$|Objective Electronic {{laboratory}} reporting {{has been}} promoted {{as a public health}} priority. The Office of the U. S. National Coordinator for Health Information Technology has endorsed two coding systems: Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) for laboratory <b>test</b> <b>orders</b> and Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) for test results. Materials and Methods We examined LOINC and SNOMED CT code use in electronic laboratory data reported in 2011 by 63 non-federal hospitals to BioSense electronic syndromic surveillance system. We analyzed the frequencies, characteristics, and code concepts of <b>test</b> <b>orders</b> and results. Results A total of 14, 028, 774 laboratory <b>test</b> <b>orders</b> or results were reported. No <b>test</b> <b>orders</b> used SNOMED CT codes. To describe <b>test</b> <b>orders,</b> 77 % used a LOINC code, 17 % had no value, and 6 % had a non-informative value, "OTH". Thirty-three percent (33 %) of test results had missing or non-informative codes. For test results with at least one informative value, 91. 8 % had only LOINC codes, 0. 7 % had only SNOMED codes, and 7. 4 % had both. Of 108 SNOMED CT codes reported without LOINC codes, 45 % could be matched to at least one LOINC code. Conclusion Missing or non-informative codes comprised almost a quarter of laboratory <b>test</b> <b>orders</b> and a third of test results reported to BioSense by non-federal hospitals. Use of LOINC codes for laboratory test results was more common than use of SNOMED CT.

40|$|Requesting {{blood tests}} is an {{important}} aspect of the health care delivered by the general practitioner in The Netherlands. About three to four percent of the patients encounters with Dutch general practitioners result in the physician requesting blood tests, which is lower than in many other European countries. Although <b>test</b> <b>ordering</b> is limited to three to four percent of patients encounters with the general practitioner, the use of diagnostic tests in general practice, has known an overwhelming growth in the years behind. Physicians' use of blood tests, however, is not always appropriate. General practitioners are taught <b>test</b> <b>ordering</b> when training in hospitals before settling down in general practice. Hospital morbidity, however, is different from morbidity patterns in general practice. Appropriate <b>test</b> <b>ordering</b> panels in hospital settings, therefore, are not always appropriate for primary care. Nevertheless, general practitioners use these test panels, once taught, automatically in the primary care setting. Uncertainty and the desire not to miss a diagnosis stimulate the use of blood tests. Excessive and inappropriate <b>test</b> <b>ordering</b> is not only expensive but also may even add to the uncertainty by generating unexpected abnormal or false positive values. The use of blood tests may thus even increase uncertainty and stimu late further unnecessary diagnostic investigations. It is important, therefore, that once the decision to obtain blood tests has been made, appropriate <b>test</b> <b>ordering</b> is adhered to.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Guidelines {{are viewed}} as a {{mechanism}} for disseminating a rapidly increasing body of knowledge. We determined the compliance of Dutch general practitioners with the recommendations for blood <b>test</b> <b>ordering</b> as defined in the guidelines of the Dutch College of General Practitioners. METHODS: We performed an audit of guideline compliance over a 12 -month period (March 1996 through February 1997). In an observational study, a guideline-based decision support system for blood <b>test</b> <b>ordering,</b> BloodLink, was integrated with the electronic patient records of 31 general practitioners practicing in 23 practices (16 solo). BloodLink followed the guidelines of the Dutch College of General Practitioners. We determined compliance by comparing the recommendations for <b>test</b> <b>ordering</b> with the <b>test(s)</b> actually <b>ordered.</b> Compliance was expressed {{as the percentage of}} order forms that followed the recommendations for <b>test</b> <b>ordering.</b> RESULTS: Of 12 668 orders generated, 9091 (71 %) used the decision-support software rather than the paper order forms. Twelve indications accounted for > 80 % of the 7346 order forms that selected a testing indication in BloodLink. The most frequently used indication for <b>test</b> <b>ordering</b> was "vague complaints" (2209 order forms; 30. 1 %). Of the 7346 order forms, 39 % were compliant. The most frequent type of noncompliance was the addition of tests. Six of the 12 tests most frequently added to the order forms were supported by revisions of guidelines that occurred within 3 years after the intervention period.

40|$|Abstract Background Immediate blood {{testing for}} {{patients}} presenting with unexplained complaints in family practice is superfluous from a diagnostic point of view. However, many general pracitioners (GPs) <b>order</b> <b>tests</b> immediately. Watchful waiting reduces {{the number of}} patients to be tested and the number of false-positive results. The objectives of this study are: to determine the feasibility of watchful waiting compared to immediate test ordering; to determine if a special quality improvement strategy can improve this feasibility; and to determine if watchful waiting leads to testing at a later time. Methods The study is a cluster-randomized clinical trial with three groups, on blood <b>test</b> <b>ordering</b> strategies in patients with unexplained complaints. GPs in group one were instructed to <b>order</b> <b>tests</b> immediately and GPs in group two to apply a watchful waiting approach. GPs in group three received the same instruction as group two, but they were supported by a systematically designed quality improvement strategy. A total of 498 patients with unexplained complaints from 63 practices of Dutch GPs participated. We measured: the percentage of patients for whom <b>tests</b> were <b>ordered</b> and number of <b>tests</b> <b>ordered</b> at the first consultation; performance on the strategy's performance objectives (i. e., <b>ordering</b> fewer <b>tests</b> and specific communication skills); the number of <b>tests</b> <b>ordered</b> after four weeks; and GP and patient characteristics. Results Immediate <b>test</b> <b>ordering</b> proved feasible in 92 % of the patients; watchful waiting in 86 % and 84 %, respectively, for groups two and three. The two watchful waiting groups did not differ significantly in the achievement of any of the performance objectives. Of the patients who returned after four weeks, none from group one and six from the two watchful waiting groups had <b>tests</b> <b>ordered</b> for them. Conclusions Watchful waiting is a feasible approach. It does not lead to testing immediately afterwards. Furthermore, watchful waiting was not improved by the quality improvement strategy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Much {{research}} worldwide is focussed on {{cost containment}} and better adherence to guidelines in healthcare. The research focussing on professional behaviour is often {{performed in a}} well-controlled research setting. In this study a large-scale implementation of a peer review strategy was tested on both <b>test</b> <b>ordering</b> and prescribing behaviour in primary care in the normal quality improvement setting. METHODS: We planned a cluster-RCT in existing local quality improvement collaboratives (LQICs) in primary care. The study ran from January 2008 to January 2011. LQICs {{were randomly assigned to}} one of two trial arms, with each arm receiving the same intervention of audit and feedback combined with peer review. Both arms were offered five different clinical topics and acted as blind controls for the other arm. The differences in <b>test</b> <b>ordering</b> rates and prescribing rates between both arms were analysed in an intention-to-treat pre-post analysis and a per-protocol analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-one LQIC groups, including 197 GPs working in 88 practices, entered the trial. The intention-to-treat analysis did not show a difference in the changes in <b>test</b> <b>ordering</b> or prescribing performance between intervention and control groups. The per-protocol analysis showed positive results for half of the clinical topics. The increase in total <b>tests</b> <b>ordered</b> was 3 % in the intervention arm and 15 % in the control arm. For prescribing the increase in prescriptions was 20 % in the intervention arm and 66 % in the control group. It was observed that the groups with the highest baseline <b>test</b> <b>ordering</b> and prescription volumes showed the largest improvements. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the results from earlier work could not be confirmed by our attempt to implement the strategy in the field.
