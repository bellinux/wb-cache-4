25|$|In the 15th and 16th centuries, {{during the}} Age of Discovery, Coimbra was again {{one of the}} main artistic centres of Portugal <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>both</b> local and royal patronage. Coimbra bishops, {{religious}} orders and King Manuel I supported artists like Diogo Pires (father and son), Marcos Pires, João de Castilho, Diogo de Castilho and the Frenchmen, João de Ruão and Nicholas of Chanterene, among others, who left important Manueline and Renaissance works in the town. Dating from this period are the remodelling (in manueline style) of the Santa Cruz Monastery, including the tombs of Kings Afonso Henriques and Sancho I, the Renaissance Manga Fountain, the altarpieces and triumphal portal of the Old Cathedral, among other works.|$|E
500|$|Like {{many other}} western towns, the {{earliest}} restaurants in Phoenix were often steakhouses. Today, Phoenix is also {{renowned for its}} Mexican food, <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>both</b> its large Hispanic population and its proximity to Mexico. Some of Phoenix's restaurants have a long history. The Stockyards steakhouse dates to 1947, while Monti's La Casa Vieja (Spanish for [...] "The Old House") was in operation as a restaurant since the 1890s, but closed its doors November 17, 2014. [...] Macayo's (a Mexican restaurant chain) was established in Phoenix in 1946, and other major Mexican restaurants include Garcia's (1956) and Manuel's (1964). The recent population boom has brought {{people from all over}} the nation, and to a lesser extent from other countries, and has since influenced the local cuisine. Phoenix currently boasts cuisines from all over the world, such as Korean, barbecue, Cajun/Creole, Greek, Hawaiian, Irish, Japanese, sushi, Italian, fusion, Persian, Indian (South Asian), Spanish, Thai, Chinese, southwestern, Tex-Mex, Vietnamese, Brazilian, and French.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of resupply by sea {{was conducted by}} cargo ships of the US Army and US Navy. The massive demand for ships forced the UN to charter private ships and bring ships out of the reserve fleet {{to increase the number}} of the military vessels in service. Pusan was the only port in South Korea that had dock facilities large enough to handle a sizable amount of cargo. An emergency airlift of critically needed items began almost immediately from the United States to Japan. Although it did not fly into Korea, the Military Air Transport Service (MATS), Pacific Division, expanded rapidly after the outbreak of the war. The consumption of aviation gasoline <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>both</b> combat and transport aircraft was so great in the early phase of the war, taxing the very limited supply available in the Far East, that it became one of the serious logistical problems. From Pusan a good railroad system built by the Japanese extended northward. The railroads were the backbone of the UN transportation system in Korea. The [...] of Korean vehicular roads were all of a secondary nature, as measured by American or European standards.|$|E

2500|$|Each race plays {{different}}ly, <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> {{the different}} skills {{and characteristics of}} the players on offer.

Elves, by contrast, tend to have high Agility and plentiful movement, passing and dodging skills, so are more suited to avoiding contact while scoring through running and passing plays. Some teams pose challenges for experienced coaches because of inbuilt imbalances. For instance the Lizardmen team has a mixture of fast-moving Skinks and slow, heavy Sauruses, {{the challenge for the}} player being to make good use of these two complementary player types; the Halfling team is mainly composed of Halflings, who on the face of things are entirely incompetent <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> being <b>both</b> weak, slow and unskilled, but can nonetheless be played effectively ...|$|R
