5|$|Sergio {{contributed to}} November 2006 {{being the most}} active November since Pacific {{hurricane}} records began, based on using the accumulated cyclone energy index. This record later became tied with another season nine years later. After Rosa formed {{a few days before}} Sergio, November 2006 became the first since 1961 <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one storm in the month. The hurricane is currently the third strongest in the month, as well as the longest-lasting.|$|E
5|$|The {{spacecraft}} verified {{the existence}} of a magnetic field surrounding the planet and discovered that the field was offset from the centre and tilted {{in a manner similar to}} the field around Uranus. Neptune's rotation period was determined using measurements of radio emissions and Voyager 2 also showed that Neptune had a surprisingly active weather system. Six new moons were discovered, and the planet was shown <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one ring.|$|E
5|$|BSkyB's {{continued}} {{partnership with}} the Premier League {{has led to an}} increase in the value of broadcasting rights and matches televised. Managers however have voiced their concerns about the latter and the excessive cost of live rights is partly a reason why top-flight football has not returned to the BBC or ITV. In 2005 BSkyB's monopoly on live rights ended after the European Commission ruled that the Premier League needed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one holder.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} {{fifty years after}} 1945, every {{published}} description and drawing of the Little Boy mechanism assumed that a small, solid projectile was fired {{into the center of}} a larger, stationary target. However, critical mass considerations dictated that in Little Boy the larger, hollow piece would be the projectile. The assembled fissile core had more than two critical masses of uranium-235. This required one of the two pieces <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one critical mass, with the larger piece avoiding criticality prior to assembly by means of shape and minimal contact with the neutron-reflecting tungsten carbide tamper.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, some 43 {{days after}} Kepler came online, its {{operating}} scientists submitted {{a list of}} over 700 exoplanet candidates for review. Of those, five were originally suspected <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one planet. Kepler-9 {{was one of the}} multiplanetary systems; it was identified as such when scientists noticed significant variations in the time intervals at which Kepler-9 was transited. Kepler-9 holds the first multiplanetary system discovered using the transit method. It is also the first planetary system where transiting planets were confirmed through transit timing variations method, allowing to calculate the masses of planets. The discovery of the planets was announced on August 26, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Newspapers of {{the time}} {{reported}} that the society promoted free love, but the society promoted free love only {{in the sense that}} consenting adults had a right to change partners and even <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one partner at a time. Rather than promiscuousness, though, the society promoted tolerance, including tolerance of homosexuality. The Spirit Fruit Society, unlike most other communitarian groups of that time, did not seek to convert or recruit others to the group. Members were permitted to come and go as they pleased. The goal of the commune was not to convert or to expand membership in the societyâ€”it was simply to live as the adherents wished to live.|$|E

5|$|On October 5 at Citi Field, in a 3-0 {{win over}} the {{defending}} National League Champion New York Mets in the NL Wild Card Game, Bumgarner pitched his third career postseason complete game four-hit shutout {{to give him the}} most career complete game shutouts {{in the history of the}} Wild Card Era with two. In other words, he set the Major League record for most career complete game shutout wins in winner-take-all-games, the first and only pitcher <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one. Bumgarner's third career postseason shutout ties him for second all-time behind Christy Mathewson's four. He also tied Tom Glavine's Major League record with six career scoreless postseason starts and lowered his Major League career postseason road record to a microscopic 0.50 ERA.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoris}} is {{the human}} female's most sensitive erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female sexual pleasure. In humans and other mammals, it develops from an outgrowth in the embryo called the genital tubercle. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a penis or a clitoris, depending on {{the presence or absence}} of the protein tdf, which is codified by a single gene on the Y chromosome. The clitoris is a complex structure, and its size and sensitivity can vary. The glans (head) of the human clitoris is roughly the size and shape of a pea, and is estimated <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 8,000 sensory nerve endings.|$|E
5|$|West Germany and East Germany were {{formally}} reunited on 3 October 1990. The 63rd Academy Awards, held on 25 March 1991, {{were thus}} the first at which Germany {{was able to}} participate as a single country. Reunified Germany {{has been successful in}} the Best Foreign Language Film category, securing two wins and eight nominations in less than two decades. The two German films that received the award since reunification are The Lives of Others (2006) by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck and Nowhere in Africa (2001) by Caroline Link, the only German director <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one film nominated for the award. Several other German films have received Academy Awards in categories other than Best Foreign Language Film.|$|E

5|$|Koufax was {{the first}} pitcher to win {{multiple}} Cy Young Awards, {{as well as the}} first pitcher to win a Cy Young Award by a unanimous vote. He is also the only pitcher to win three Cy Young Awards in the era in which the award was presented to one pitcher across the board, rather than one in each major league, and one of three Dodgers pitchers to win the one-across-the-board Cy Young Award. (The others were Don Newcombe, the first Cy Young winner in 1956, and Don Drysdale in 1962.) Each of Koufax's three Cy Young Awards were by unanimous vote. Koufax and Juan Marichal are the only two pitchers in the post-war era (1946-date) <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one 25-win season, with each pitcher recording three.|$|E
5|$|When {{a warrior}} is so old, or sustains an injury {{that means they}} can no longer serve their Clan, they retire to become elders. Elders live out the {{remainder}} of their life in general peace, using it as a time of rest and relaxation. They sleep in their own separate den, which is looked after by the apprentices. Elders are not expected to hunt or fight for their Clan, but are able to do so if the mood takes them. Their only expected duty is to carry the body of a deceased Clanmate to their grave. Every cat of the Clan respects and appreciates the elders, thanking them for the time they have spent upholding their roles as a warrior. Sadly, it is rare for a Clan <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> three or four elders, as many warriors die before they can retire.|$|E
5|$|Gao Ling is {{the all-time}} {{leader for the}} most Olympic medals in badminton, with two gold, one silver, and one bronze; Kim Dong-moon (two gold, one bronze) and Gil Young-ah (one of each) are second for the most medals in badminton, each with three. Gao, Kim, and Zhang Jun are the all-time leaders for the most gold medal wins, with two. In the 1992 Summer Olympics, Jalani and Razif Sidek were the first Malaysian Olympic medalists since Malaysia first participated the 1964 Summer Olympics. Mia Audina won her first silver in the 1996 Olympics {{representing}} Indonesia, but won her second silver in the 2004 Summer Olympics with the Netherlands. In the 2000 Summer Olympics, China swept the women's doubles tournament, winning all three medals, making it the only sweep in Olympic badminton history. China {{has been the most}} successful nation in badminton, winning 38 medals; 28 of them were from the women's singles and doubles and mixed doubles tournaments. Indonesia (18 medals) and South Korea (18 medals) are the only other nations <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> seven medals. As of the 2008 Summer Olympics, 76 medals (24 gold, 24 silver, and 28 bronze) have been awarded to 96 athletes from 7 NOCs. There were four additional bronze medal winners in the 1992 Summer Olympics because no bronze medal matches were played in any of the four tournaments.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, RodrÃ­guez was {{selected}} as the American League MVP. He set a new American League record for home runs in a single season among catchers with 35. RodrÃ­guez was also the first catcher <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 30home runs, 100 runs batted in, and 100 runs scored in the history of Major League Baseball. In addition, he holds the distinction of being the first catcher {{in the history of the}} league to amass more than 20home runs and 20stolen bases. From May 8, 1999 to June 1, 1999, RodrÃ­guez had a career high 20 game hitting streak. He had 25 stolen bases, which was fifth most among catchers in the history of the league. He led the league in times grounded into a double play, with 31. RodrÃ­guez was only the ninth catcher in the history of Major League Baseball to win the Most Valuable Player award, and he was the first to win it since Thurman Munson in 1976. He was named on all of the ballots, getting seven first place votes and six second place votes. RodrÃ­guez was the sixth Puerto Rican to win the award, and the fourth player from the Texas Rangers to win it. He also won the Silver Slugger Award for the sixth time in a row and {{was selected}} Most Valuable Player by Baseball Digest. He was again named to all-star teams by the Associated Press, The Sporting News, and Baseball America. While he was hitting home runs, he wasn't taking many walks. He is one of only six players active in 2009 who have had at least 30 home runs in a season in which they had more homers than walks (34 HR, 24 BB in 1999). The others are Alfonso Soriano (39â€“23 in 2002, 36â€“33 in 2005, 33â€“31 in 2007), Garret Anderson (35â€“24 in 2000), Ryan Braun (34â€“29 in 2007), Joe Crede (30â€“28 in 2006), and JosÃ© GuillÃ©n (31â€“24 in 2003).|$|E
