40|$|Our {{effort to}} {{understand}} crime rate change is hampered by governmental thinking about crime, and the vested interest governments have in favourable (popular) outcomes. At least as practised in the United Kingdom, thinking about burglary often assumes a ‘top-down ’ approach, placing most of the drivers of crime rate change {{in the hands of}} government; while reducing private citizens to passive, isolated individuals, and civil society and its institutions to a wasteland devoid of intention, morality and purpose (Hope and Karstedt, 2003). Not surprisingly, the increasing use of crime statistics as a source for governmental performance measurement (Matrix and Hope, 2006) tends to reinforce government’s own self-image that it has (or ought to have) the dominant influence over society’s crime (Garland, 2001) 2. Because of this, governments find it difficult to come up with narratives to explain the changes in crime rates observed in their own national statistics: reluctant to take responsibility when crime goes up, at a loss to explain why it goes down. Part of their difficulty rests in failing to acknowledge sufficiently the active role played by private citizens and civil institutions within society (Hope and Karstedt, 2003).

40|$|Recent {{government}} {{policy in the}} Netherlands has supported {{the introduction of a}} number of new types of agents of social control. This article, {{based on the results of}} two recent research projects (Hauber et al. 1993 a, b), focuses on three questions central to the effectiveness and acceptability of three kinds of agents: city wardens, police patrollers, and public transport inspectors. First, objective security: what effects did supervision by different types of agents have on those forms of crime with which the agents were confronted, as observed by the researchers? Secondly, the performance of the agents and the reactions of the members of the public with whom they were in contact will be discussed. Finally, subjective security will be discussed: did the agents have a positive influence on the public's perception of their safety? The degree to which informal social control is accepted differs from culture to culture. One could place the different cultures on a continuum with on one pole, state encouraged, widespread informal social control networks (as in former communistic countries) and on the opposite pole almost a complete lack of informal social control. The latter is the case in the Netherlands, where offenders will not easily accept interference from other members of the public. Nevertheless if anyone <b>tries</b> <b>t...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: The right {{research}} {{framework is}} the only way to lead us to become champions in our respective disciplines and certainly to be recognized as an excellent referral center of knowledge for the world. Deming, a well-known quality guru, has defined two research frameworks, namely enumerative study and analytic study. They are totally different in their applications and implications. He criticizes analytic study as it is the most misguided and poorly taught research approach in most universities, as compared to enumerative study. Approach: Intensive literature reviews were conducted to obtain in-depth understanding concerning Deming’s teachings through books, websites and journals. Results: Enumerative study aims to describe the magnitude of the study problem with its possible correlated variable (s). The study objectives, its variables ’ scope, hypothesis and research method are predetermined earlier. Common statistical tools in used are the t-test, chi-square, correlation and frequency. Outcome studies involve percentage prevalence data, new standard formula and linear modeling. The major pitfall of enumerative study is that its findings, recommendation and action for improvement could be wrongly interpreted, misleading and wrongly guided. It is because the statistically significant correlated variables do not truly support the cause to existing study problem. In analytic study, the main purpose is to answer the “why ” question.

The boundary conditions depend on a real parameter θ and break the axial flavour symmetry. We argue that this approach is more appropriate to study the broken phases than introducing small quark masses, since all calculations can be performed analytically. In the imaginary time formalism we determine the thermal correlators for the fermionfields and the determinant of the Dirac-operator in arbitrary background gauge-fields. We show that the boundary conditions induce a CP-odd θ-term in the effective action. The chiral condensate, and in particular its T- and L- dependence, is calculated for Nf fermions. It is seen {{to depend on the}} order in which the two lengths β = 1 /T and L are Over the past decades the Schwinger model [1] has proved to be an excellent laboratory for field theory because it turned out to shed some light on a couple of questions which naturally arise in realistic gauge-field theories, but lead to immense difficulties as soon as one <b>tries</b> <b>t...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Fiat-Shamir {{paradigm}} {{was proposed}} {{as a way}} to remove interaction from 3 -round proof of knowledge protocols and derive secure signature schemes. This generic transformation leads to very efficient schemes and has thus grown quite popular. However, this transformation is proven secure only in the random oracle model. In FOCS 2003, Goldwasser and Kalai showed that this transformation is provably insecure in the standard model by presenting a counterexample of a 3 -round protocol, the Fiat-Shamir transformation of which is (although provably secure in the random oracle model) insecure in the standard model, thus showing that the random oracle is uninstantiable. In particular, for every hash function that is used to replace the random oracle, the resulting signature scheme is existentially forgeable. This result was shown by relying on the non-black-box techniques of Barak (FOCS 2001). An alternative to the Fiat-Shamir paradigm was proposed by Fischlin in Crypto 2005. Fischlin’s transformation can be applied to any so called 3 -round “Fiat-Shamir proof of knowledge’ ’ and can be used to derive non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge as well as signature schemes. An attractive property of this transformation is that it provides online extractability (i. e., the extractor works without having to rewind the prover).

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an approach based on network theory {{to deal with}} risk interactions in large engineering projects. Indeed, such projects are exposed to numerous and interdependent risks of various nature, which makes their management more difficult. In this paper, a topological analysis based on network theory is presented, which aims at identifying key elements {{in the structure of}} interrelated risks potentially affecting a large engineering project. This analysis serves as a powerful complement to classical project risk analysis. Its originality lies in the application of some network theory indicators to the project risk management field. The construction of the risk network requires the involvement of the project manager and other team members assigned to the risk management process. Its interpretation improves their understanding of risks and their potential interactions. The outcomes of the analysis provide a support for decision-making regarding project risk management. An example of application to a real large engineering project is presented. The conclusion is that some new insights can be found about risks, about their interactions and about the global potential behavior of the project. 1. Introduction Projects are usually complex and risky. They require the timely accomplishment of a number of activities, carried out by a number of human and material resources. Unexpected conditions or planning errors may lead to failures which can undermine the successful realization of the project on numerous parameters, like time, cost, scope, quality, safety, security, health, and environment. We refer to such events as project risks, when they are identified, analyzed and treated before they occur. Within the same project, the existence of interrelated risks involves that the occurrence of one risk may trigger one or more other risks with potential propagation phenomena like reaction chains, amplification chains or loops. In this sense, in this paper we talk of risk interdependency between two risks. A consequence of a risk is then triggering of another risk and not the direct impact of the risk itself (e. g. on time, scope or cost), which of course exists but is not the focus here. The consequence of this complexity is a lack of capacity to anticipate and control the behavior of the project. Large engineering projects are facing a growing complexity, in both their structure and context due to the involvement of numerous, diverse and strongly interrelated elements [1 - 3]. This has sparked research works on the concept of complexity, under two main scientific approaches [4]. The first one, usually known as the field of descriptive complexity, considers complexity as an intrinsic property of a system. For example, Baccarini in [1] considers project complexity through the concepts of technological complexity and organizational complexity. He regards them as the core components of project complexity which he <b>tries</b> <b>t...</b>|$|E
