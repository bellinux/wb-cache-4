5|$|The British {{educational}} policies segregating {{the different}} races — providing minimal public education for Malays, and leaving non-Malays {{to their own}} devices — did not help matters. The Malays, predominantly rural-dwellers, were not encouraged to socialise with the more urban non-Malays. The economic impoverishment of the Malays which set <b>them</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> the better-off Chinese also fanned racial sentiments.|$|E
5|$|Abbott {{has created}} several games, {{including}} card games, board games, and one equipment game. As a whole, his games {{are not of}} particular fame, although they have some unique elements that set <b>them</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> mainstream games. For instance, the card game Metamorphosis is a complex trick-taking game. As you play the game, the rules change three times, so {{it is as if}} you are playing four different games that are threaded together.|$|E
5|$|Animals as a {{category}} have several characteristics that generally set <b>them</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> other living things. Animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular (although see Myxozoa), which separates them from bacteria, archaea, and most protists. They are heterotrophic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and algae. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and fungi by lacking cell walls.|$|E

5|$|The west front, {{which was}} {{originally}} constructed in 1520, {{has a large}} arched window and detailed carvings. Above the window are carvings of angels and to either side long stone ladders with angels climbing up <b>them.</b> <b>Apart</b> <b>from</b> the story mentioned above connecting it with Oliver King, Bishop of Bath and Wells 1495–1503 this is a direct reference to {{the dream of the}} prophet Jacob mentioned in the Bible and commonly called Jacobs Ladder.|$|E
5|$|The protagonist {{and their}} friend, Eric Sparrow, live in {{suburban}} New Jersey and {{dream of becoming}} famous skateboarders. The protagonist manages to impress professional skater Chad Muska, visiting town for a demo, who gives them a new skateboard and informs them that {{a good way to}} start a skating career is to gain a sponsorship from a local skate shop. The protagonist seeks out Stacy Peralta, who agrees until he sees something to set <b>them</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> the other local skaters, so the protagonist travels to Manhattan with Eric, who is on the run from drug dealers after setting their car on fire for stealing from the skate shop.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of stone}} in Egyptian temples {{emphasized}} their purpose as eternal houses for {{the gods and}} set <b>them</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> buildings {{for the use of}} mortals, which were built of mudbrick. Early temples were built of brick and other perishable materials, and most of the outlying buildings in temple enclosures remained brick-built throughout Egyptian history. The main stones used in temple construction were limestone and sandstone, which are common in Egypt; stones that are harder and more difficult to carve, such as granite, were used in smaller amounts for individual elements like obelisks. The stone to build a temple might be quarried nearby or shipped on the Nile from quarries elsewhere.|$|E

5000|$|Hessen (Hessisch) is a West Central German {{group of}} dialects of the German {{language}} in the central German state of Hessen. The dialect most similar to Hessen is Palatinate German (Ger.: Pfälzisch, pronounced [...] ) of the Rhine Franconian sub-family. However, the Hessen dialects have some features which set <b>them</b> somewhat <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> other West-Central German dialects.|$|R
5|$|There was no {{distinct}} Angevin or Plantagenet {{culture that}} would distinguish or set <b>them</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> their neighbours in this period. Robert of Torigni recorded that Henry built or renovated castles throughout his domain in Normandy, England, Aquitaine, Anjou, Maine and Torraine. However this patronage had no distinctive style {{except in the}} use of circular or octagonal kitchens of the Fontevraud type. Similarly amongst the multiple vernacularsFrench, English and Occitanthere was not a unifying literature. French was the lingua franca of the secular elite and Latin or the church.|$|E
5|$|Many wasp lineages, {{including}} those in the families Vespidae, Crabronidae, Sphecidae, and Pompilidae, attack and sting prey items that they use as food for their larvae; while Vespidae usually macerate their prey and feed the resulting bits directly to their brood, most predatory wasps paralyze their prey and lay eggs directly upon the bodies, and the wasp larvae consume <b>them.</b> <b>Apart</b> <b>from</b> collecting prey items to provision their young, many wasps are also opportunistic feeders, and will suck the body fluids of their prey. Although vespid mandibles are adapted for chewing and {{they appear to be}} feeding on the organism, they are often merely macerating it into submission. The impact of the predation of wasps on economic pests is difficult to establish.|$|E

50|$|Since the 1950s, {{this type}} of fiction has, to a large extent, merged with science fiction tropes {{involving}} time travel between alternate histories, psychic awareness {{of the existence of}} one universe by the people in another, or time travel that results in history splitting into two or more timelines.

25|$|Together {{throughout}} the 1970s, Scott-Heron and Jackson made music {{that reflected the}} turbulence, uncertainty and increasing pessimism of the times, merging the soul and jazz traditions and drawing on an oral poetry tradition that reached back to the blues and forward to hip-hop.
