5|$|Although no jersey was awarded, {{there was}} also a {{classification}} for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total <b>time.</b> <b>There</b> <b>was</b> another team classification that awarded points to each team based off their riding's finishing position in every stage.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2007, UBS became the first Wall Street firm to announce a heavy loss in the subprime mortgage sector as the subprime mortgage crisis began to develop. In May 2007, UBS announced the closure of its Dillon Read Capital Management (DRCM) division. Before that <b>time,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> little understanding of the troubles at DRCM or the massive expansion of risk engineered by the investment banking division {{under the leadership of}} the newly placed CEO Huw Jenkins.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} <b>time,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> common resentment against the reactionary attitudes {{prevailing}} in Court circles {{even before the}} uproar sparked by the notorious banquet precipitated the political aspects of the march. Deeper planners in the crowd spread the word that the king needed to dismiss his royal bodyguards entirely and replace them all with patriotic National Guardsmen, a line of argument that had a compelling resonance among Lafayette's soldiers.|$|E

5|$|The twin {{policies}} of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan led to billions in economic and military aid for Western Europe, Greece, and Turkey. With the US assistance, the Greek military won its civil war. Under the leadership of Alcide De Gasperi the Italian Christian Democrats defeated the powerful Communist-Socialist alliance in the elections of 1948. At the same <b>time</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> increased intelligence and espionage activity, Eastern Bloc defections and diplomatic expulsions.|$|E
5|$|According to {{government}} surveyor Thomas Corby, Newton's parakeet {{may still have}} been fairly common in 1843. Slater reported that he saw a single specimen in southwestern Rodrigues during his three-month stay to observe the 1874 Transit of Venus, and assistant colonial secretary William J. Caldwell saw several specimens in 1875 during his own three-month visit. The male that he received in 1875 and gave to Newton is the last recorded member of the species. A series of cyclones struck the following year and may have devastated the remaining population. Further severe storms hit in 1878 and 1886, and since few forested areas were left by this <b>time,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> little cover to protect any remaining birds. The male could, therefore, {{have been the last}} of the species alive.|$|E

5|$|After a {{short period}} at Wigan Athletic in 2003, he joined West Bromwich Albion, with whom he again won {{promotion}} to the Premier League. In 2006, he moved to Sheffield United, but much of his <b>time</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> spent on loan to other clubs, namely Leeds United, Leicester City and Scunthorpe United. Horsfield announced his retirement from football in 2008 after being diagnosed with testicular cancer, but after successful treatment he resumed his career, signing a six-month contract for Lincoln City in January 2009. In July of that year he was appointed player-assistant manager at Port Vale under Micky Adams, and the following summer he took up coaching full-time, before leaving the game completely in May 2012. In March 2013 he returned to playing football for Alvechurch.|$|E
5|$|After being {{tracked by}} both Manchester United and Manchester City, {{he began his}} {{professional}} career at Birmingham City, where he signed a three-year contract {{at the age of}} 17. Following the departure of manager Steve Bruce, Burge was released by Birmingham in March 2008. He went on trial at League Two club Hereford United and League One side Cheltenham Town. He was verbally offered a short-term contract by Cheltenham manager Keith Downing, but the deal collapsed after Downing was replaced as the Cheltenham manager by Martin Allen. He instead joined up with League Two side Barnet. He made his debut for Barnet in the 4–0 home defeat by Notts County on 15 November 2008. This was the only appearance he made before his <b>time</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> disrupted by appendicitis, which ruled him out for four weeks. The club released him in January 2009.|$|E
5|$|At that <b>time</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> dispute {{regarding}} {{the difference between}} rational numbers and irrational numbers {{and there was no}} consistency {{in the way in which}} decimal fractions were represented. In 1586, Simon Stevin published a small pamphlet called De Thiende ("the tenth") which historians credit as being the basis of modern notation for decimal fractions. Stevin felt that this innovation was so significant that he declared the universal introduction of decimal coinage, measures, and weights to be merely a question of time.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Ramsey {{returned}} to Columbia as a professor and research scientist. Rabi and Ramsey picked up where they had left off before the war with their molecular beam experiments. Ramsey and his first graduate student, William Nierenberg, measured various nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments.With Rabi, he helped establish the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island. In 1946, he became the first head of the Physics Department there. His <b>time</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> brief, for in 1947, he joined the physics faculty at Harvard University, where he would remain for the next 40 years, except for brief visiting professorships at Middlebury College, Oxford University, Mt. Holyoke College and the University of Virginia. During the 1950s, he was the first science adviser to NATO, and initiated a series of fellowships, grants and summer school programs to train European scientists.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>time</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{a growing}} {{movement}} to attract native intelligentsia, educated at schools {{run by the}} Dutch colonial government, and convince them to view domestic films, which were {{generally considered to be}} of much lower quality than imported Hollywood productions. This was blamed, in part, on the dominance of theatrically trained actors and crew. As such, Ariffien invited Gani, at the time a medical doctor and a prominent member of the nationalist movement, to join the cast. Although some nationalists considered Gani's involvement in Asmara Moerni as besmirching the independence movement, Gani considered it necessary: he believed audiences needed to have higher opinions of domestic film productions.|$|E
5|$|Between 1879 and 1884, Cantor {{published}} {{a series of}} six articles in Mathematische Annalen that together formed an introduction to his set theory. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> growing opposition to Cantor's ideas, led by Kronecker, who admitted mathematical concepts only {{if they could be}} constructed in a finite number of steps from the natural numbers, which he took as intuitively given. For Kronecker, Cantor's hierarchy of infinities was inadmissible, since accepting the concept of actual infinity would open the door to paradoxes which would challenge the validity of mathematics as a whole. Cantor also introduced the Cantor set during this period.|$|E
