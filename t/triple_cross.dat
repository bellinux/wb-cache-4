40|$|Abstract. A <b>triple</b> <b>{{crossing}}</b> is a crossing in {{a projection}} of a knot or link that has three strands of the knot passing straight through it. A <b>triple</b> <b>crossing</b> projection is a projection such {{that all of the}} crossings are triple crossings. We prove that every knot and link has a <b>triple</b> <b>crossing</b> projection and then investigate c 3 (K), which is the minimum number of triple crossings in {{a projection of}} K. We obtain upper and lower bounds on c 3 (K) in terms of the traditional crossing number and show that both are realized. We also relate <b>triple</b> <b>crossing</b> number to the span of the bracket polynomial and use this to determine c 3 (K) for a variety of knots and links. We then use c 3 (K) to obtain bounds on the volume of a hyperbolic knot or link. We also consider extensions to cn(K). 1...|$|R

500|$|Broccoli's {{original}} {{choice for}} the role of Domino Derval was Julie Christie following her performance in Billy Liar in 1963. Upon meeting her personally, however, he was disappointed and turned his attentions towards Raquel Welch after seeing her {{on the cover of the}} October 1964 issue of Life. Welch, however, was hired by Richard Zanuck of 20th Century Fox to appear in the film Fantastic Voyage the same year, instead. Faye Dunaway was also considered for the role and came close to signing for the part. Saltzman and Broccoli auditioned an extensive list of relatively unknown European actresses and models, including former Miss Italy Maria Grazia Buccella, Yvonne Monlaur of the Hammer horror films, and Gloria Paul. Eventually, former Miss France Claudine Auger was cast, and the script was rewritten to make her character French rather than Italian, although her lines were redubbed for the final cut. Nevertheless, director Young [...] cast her once again in his next film, <b>Triple</b> <b>Cross</b> (1966). One of the actresses who tried for Domino, Luciana Paluzzi, later accepted the role as the redheaded femme fatale assassin Fiona Kelly, who originally was intended by Maibaum to be Irish. The surname was changed to Volpe in co-ordination with Paluzzi's nationality.|$|E
