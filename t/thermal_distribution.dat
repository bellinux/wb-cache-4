25|$|In {{the image}} {{accompanying}} this article, the velocity-distribution data indicates {{the formation of}} a Bose–Einstein condensate out of a gas of rubidium atoms. The false colors indicate the number of atoms at each velocity, with red being the fewest and white being the most. The areas appearing white and light blue are at the lowest velocities. The peak is not infinitely narrow because of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: spatially confined atoms have a minimum width velocity distribution. This width is given by the curvature of the magnetic potential in the given direction. More tightly confined directions have bigger widths in the ballistic velocity distribution. This anisotropy of the peak on the right is a purely quantum-mechanical effect and does not exist in the <b>thermal</b> <b>distribution</b> on the left.

40|$|Energy {{minimization}} {{of parallel}} applications considering <b>thermal</b> <b>distributions</b> among the processor cores is an emerging challenge for {{current and future}} generations of many-core computing systems. This paper proposes an adaptive energy minimization approach that hierarchically applies dynamic voltage frequency scaling (DVFS), thread-to-core affinity and dynamic concurrency controls (DCT) to address this challenge. The aim is to minimize the energy consumption and achieve balanced <b>thermal</b> <b>distributions</b> among cores, thereby improving the lifetime reliability of the system, while meeting a specified power budget requirement. Fundamental to this approach is an iterative learning-based control algorithm that adapts the VFS and core allocations dynamically based on the CPU workloads and <b>thermal</b> <b>distributions</b> of the processor cores, guided by the CPU performance counters at regular intervals. The adaptation is facilitated through modified OpenMP library-based power budget annotations.
