500|$|Early in his presidency, Hay and Nicolay {{requested}} {{and received}} permission from Lincoln {{to write his}} biography. By 1872, Hay was [...] "convinced <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at work on our 'Lincoln.' I don't think the time for publication has come, but the time for preparation is slipping away." [...] Robert Lincoln in 1874 formally agreed to let Hay and Nicolay use his father's papers; by 1875, they were engaged in research. Hay and Nicolay enjoyed exclusive access to Lincoln's papers, which were not opened to other researchers until 1947. They gathered documents written by others, {{as well as many}} of the Civil War books already being published. [...] They at rare times relied on memory, such as Nicolay's recollection of the moment at the 1860 Republican convention when Lincoln was nominated, but for much of the rest relied on research.|$|E

2500|$|On gay rights, Thompson says, [...] "I think <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a {{tolerant}} nation. I {{think we}} ought to be tolerant people. But we shouldn't set up special categories for anybody. [...] And I'm for the rights of everybody, including gays, but not any special rights." [...] He believes that, [...] "marriage is between a man and a woman, and I don't believe judges ought to come along and change that." ...|$|E

40|$|Many believe <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> save a {{large number}} from being {{permanently}} bedridden rather than save one from death. Many also believe <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> save one from death rather than a multitude from a very minor harm, no matter how large this multitude. I argue that a principle I call “Aggregate Relevant Claims” satisfactorily explains these judgments. I offer a rationale for this principle and defend it against objections...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, it's not a question, I think, {{on which}} they quite feel together. SHE thinks, dear Fanny, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> greater." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But what I {{want to know}} is this: Is it to Senor Perkins <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{thankful for}} seeing you here at all?" [...] asked Mrs. Markham impatiently.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{all very}} well," [...] she answered, [...] "but I am not sure <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the gallery at Covent Garden together, with a {{chaperon}} who will sleep!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Westmacott {{says that}} every woman should follow a calling, and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> choose those which women have always avoided." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've been thinking, dear, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> {{call upon}} <b>that</b> young lady who {{arranged}} our rooms, and thank {{her for her}} kindness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you think," [...] said Mr. Newberry, [...] "I {{speak as}} a {{practical}} man, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> do something to get the newspapers with us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I will, and, so {{far from}} {{thinking}} you a fool, I was much impressed with your learning tonight and told Steve <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> proud of our philosopher." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “For my part, I can’t {{share your}} view. It is selfish. My sentiments {{for my own}} country cannot be doubted; but I’ve always felt <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> good Europeans besides—I mean governments and men.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sooner or later," [...] Peter Ruff said genially, [...] "I {{should like}} to have a little {{conversation}} with you, Major. I fancy <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to find plenty of subjects of common interest." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "James," [...] said he, [...] "I was {{thinking}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> send for the horses;--and the apples <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be gathered too. Which is {{it best to}} do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He hasn't a {{doubt of}} it," [...] I went on diplomatically. [...] "But we felt--and I felt personally, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{in touch with}} you, to work along with you, to keep {{informed}} {{how things are going}} in the city." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{see that}} we can," [...] Ned replied. [...] "Marsden lies to the east, so we have only to keep our backs to the sun; it won't be down for another two hours yet, and before <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{should say}} {{that it does not}} matter a bit how we are dressed, till we reach the river. We know now pretty nearly every lane in the country," [...] Leigh said, [...] "and I should think <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to reach the Loire." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jone {{tried to}} comfort me by telling me <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very glad we don't like {{this sort of}} thing.

6000|$|... "The {{answer is}} very simple," [...] replied Wayne, calmly. [...] "It is because <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be defeated. <b>We</b> {{have been in}} the most horrible holes before now; but in all those I was {{perfectly}} certain that the stars were on our side, and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> get out.

40|$|With very {{advanced}} technology, a {{very large}} population of people living happy lives could be sustained in the accessible region of the universe. For every year that development of such technologies and colonization {{of the universe is}} delayed, there is therefore an opportunity cost: a potential good, lives worth living, is not being realized. Given some plausible assumptions, this cost is extremely large. However, the lesson for utilitarians is not <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> maximize the pace of technological development, but rather <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> maximize its safety, i. e. the probability that colonization will eventually occur...|$|R
