5|$|Bamber brought 16 {{issues to}} the {{attention}} of the court. Two (grounds 14 and 15) related to the silencer and DNA testing; the rest were about failure to disclose evidence or <b>the</b> <b>fabrication</b> of evidence.

5|$|Taiwanese Plains Aborigines {{were often}} {{employed}} and dispatched as interpreters {{to assist in}} the trade of goods between Han merchants and Highlands aborigines. The aborigines traded cloth, pelts and meat for iron and matchlock rifles. Iron was a necessary material for <b>the</b> <b>fabrication</b> of hunting knives—long, curved sabers that were generally used as a forest tool. These blades became notorious among Han settlers, given their alternative use to decapitate Highland indigenous enemies in customary headhunting expeditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{first new}} sets (intended for Phase II) were {{constructed}} beginning July 25, 1977. <b>The</b> <b>fabrication</b> was supervised by Joseph Jennings, an art director {{involved in the}} original television series, special-effects expert Jim Rugg, and former Trek designer Matt Jefferies, on loan as consultant from Little House on the Prairie. When the television series was cancelled and plans for a film put into place, new sets were needed for the large 70mm film format.|$|E

5|$|The {{spandrel}} {{plates were}} welded to the columns {{to create the}} modular pieces off-site at <b>the</b> <b>fabrication</b> shop. The modular pieces were typically 52inches (1.3m) deep, and extended for two full floors and half of two more floors. Adjacent modules were bolted together, with the splices occurring at mid-span of the columns and spandrels. The spandrel plates were located at each floor, transmitting shear stress between columns, allowing them {{to work together in}} resisting lateral loads. The joints between modules were staggered vertically, so the column splices between adjacent modules were not at the same floor.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture is the {{mainstay}} of the Malagasy economy. Land {{is used for the}} cultivation of rice and other crops, raising of zebu and other livestock, <b>the</b> <b>fabrication</b> of bricks and other traditional livelihoods. In Antananarivo, access to land is guaranteed and protected by law for every resident of the city. The CUA manages requests to lease or purchase land, but demand dramatically outstrips supply and much of the unallocated land fails to meet the requisite criteria for parceling, such as land where floodwater runoff is diverted. Much of this marginal land has been illegally occupied and developed by land-seeking residents, creating shantytown slums in pockets throughout the lower portions of the city. This uncontrolled development poses sanitation and safety risks to residents in these areas.|$|E
