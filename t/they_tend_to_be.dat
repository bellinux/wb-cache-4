5|$|Scotties, {{while being}} {{described}} as very loving, {{have also been}} described as stubborn. They are sometimes described as an aloof breed, {{although it has been}} noted that <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very loyal to their family and are known to attach themselves to one or two people.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} produce significant, although usually mild, {{side effects}} including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes side effects appear {{even at a}} minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician {{to search for a}} different drug. Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even more strongly than levodopa. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more expensive than levodopa.|$|E
50|$|Although {{specials}} {{are considered}} series {{in their own}} right, <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> intertwined with the main series.|$|R

5|$|Most {{cases of}} SAH {{are due to}} trauma. In 85 percent of cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, the cause is rupture of a cerebral aneurysm—a weakness in the wall {{of one of the}} arteries in the brain that becomes enlarged. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> located in the circle of Willis and its branches. While most cases of SAH are due to bleeding from small aneurysms, larger aneurysms (which are less common) are more likely to rupture. Aspirin also appears to increase the risk.|$|E
5|$|Most rodents {{are small}} animals with robust bodies, short limbs, and long tails. They use their sharp incisors to gnaw food, {{excavate}} burrows, and defend themselves. Most eat seeds or other plant material, but some have more varied diets. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> social animals and many species live in societies with complex ways {{of communicating with}} each other. Mating among rodents can vary from monogamy, to polygyny, to promiscuity. Many have litters of underdeveloped, altricial young, while others are precocial (relatively well developed) at birth.|$|E
5|$|Other {{defensive}} {{strategies are}} {{the use of}} camouflage, fleeing, and aggression. Some species have adopted colourings, shapes, and patterns that {{make it difficult for}} predators that hunt by sight to detect them. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dull shades of brown, grey, and green that blend into their background, and desert species tend to be pale. Some species can fly, but the mode of flight tends to be clumsy, so the most usual response to danger is to scuttle away to find a hiding place.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to their}} {{geographic}} concentration, it <b>is</b> noted that <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> isolated {{and had an}} insular culture. As a result, <b>they</b> also <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very late in their adoption of the English language and of western culture in general. The insular culture and resultant intermarriage {{can result in a}} high degree of consanguinity amongst Vathimas.|$|R
50|$|The list is not exhaustive. Streets {{were also}} named after Werner Lamberz, {{although}} <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> renamed after the East German state became discredited following German reunification in 1990.|$|R
50|$|There are {{at least}} ten ancient scripts that {{classify}} as Laṇḍā scripts. <b>They</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used as the mercantile scripts of the Punjab region and were normally not used for literary purposes.|$|R
5|$|The sexes are similar, but {{the female}} {{tends to be}} duller than the male, with a brown tint to the head, brown upperparts and less bright underparts. However, some birds cannot be safely sexed on plumage alone. The {{juvenile}} is paler in color than the adult male and has dark spots on its breast, and whitish wing coverts. First-year birds are not easily distinguishable from adults, but <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> duller, and a small percentage retains a few juvenile wing coverts or other feathers.|$|E
5|$|The {{structural}} {{history of}} the Roman military describes the major chronological transformations in the organisation and constitution of the Roman armed forces. The Roman military was split into the Roman army and the Roman navy, although these two branches were less distinct than <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in modern defence forces. Within the top-level branches of army and navy, structural changes occurred both {{as a result of}} positive military reform and through organic structural evolution.|$|E
5|$|Coloured {{gold and}} green, the frogs are {{voracious}} eaters of insects, {{but will also}} eat larger prey, such as worms and mice. Unlike most frogs, they are active at day, although this is mostly to warm in the sun. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less active in winter except in warmer or wetter periods, and breed in the warmer months. Males reach maturity after around 9 months, while for the larger females, this does not occur until they are two years old. The frogs can engage in cannibalism, and males frequently attack and injure one another if they infringe on one another's space.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} fictional works since the 1940s have {{contained}} elements similar to elements of reality television. <b>They</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{set in a}} dystopian future, with subjects being recorded against their will, and often involved violence.|$|R

5|$|All LMS tenders {{were given}} {{their own unique}} {{identity}} numbers and <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> constructed {{in advance of the}} locomotives they would be paired with. Hence, they were made in four batches, Nos. 9703–9709, 9743–9752, 9798–9817 and 10622-10624.|$|R
5|$|Halfbeaks {{are not a}} major {{target for}} {{commercial}} fisheries, though small fisheries for them exist in some places, for example in South Australia where fisheries target the southern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus melanochir). and the eastern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus australis). Halfbeaks are caught {{by a variety of}} methods including seines and pelagic trawls, dip-netting under lights at night, and with haul nets. They are utilized fresh, dried, smoked, or salted, and they are considered good eating. However, even where halfbeaks are targeted by fisheries, <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of secondary importance compared with other edible fish species.|$|E
5|$|Once food {{leaves the}} crop, it passes to the midgut (element 13 in {{numbered}} diagram), {{also known as}} the mesenteron, where the majority of digestion takes place. Microscopic projections from the midgut wall, called microvilli, increase the surface area of the wall and allow more nutrients to be absorbed; <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> close to the origin of the midgut. In some insects, the role of the microvilli and where they are located may vary. For example, specialized microvilli producing digestive enzymes may more likely be {{near the end of the}} midgut, and absorption near the origin or beginning of the midgut.|$|E
5|$|The Gaelic Revival of {{the early}} twentieth century has had a {{long-term}} influence. There is now an extensive network of urban Irish speakers (Gaeilgeoirí) in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, especially in Dublin and Belfast. They represent an expanding demographic, with their own schools (called Gaelscoileanna) and their own social media. It has been argued that <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more highly educated than monolingual English speakers, with better employment prospects and higher social status. Recent research suggests that urban Irish is developing in a direction of its own, both in pronunciation and grammar. Irish is also taught in mainstream English-speaking schools as a compulsory subject, but has been criticised for its ineffectiveness.|$|E
50|$|A bottle crate or {{beverage}} crate is {{a container}} used for transport of beverage containers. In {{the present day}} they are usually made of plastic, but before {{the widespread use of}} plastic <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made of wood or metal.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the policy literature, academic publications were initially few and far between. On the whole <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> critical {{of the concept of}} community cohesion, though some of the more recent works have been much more supportive.|$|R
50|$|Vector {{graphics}} printing <b>was</b> left <b>to</b> special-purpose devices, called plotters. Almost all plotters did share {{a common}} command language, HPGL, but were of limited use for anything other than printing graphics. In addition, <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> expensive and slow, and thus rare.|$|R
5|$|The Marsh Tacky {{is known}} by owners for its stamina {{and ability to}} work in water and swamps without panicking. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sure-footed, sturdy, smart, and able to survive in {{challenging}} coastal environments, {{as well as being}} easy keepers. Their small size and gentle nature made them the historically preferred mount for children and women, but they were also used as working animals due to their abilities in the field. Today, they are used in endurance riding, as well as continuing their traditional work assisting humans with hunting wild game and herding cattle.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaves of}} trees are widely {{gathered}} as fodder for livestock and some can be eaten by humans but <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> high in tannins {{which makes them}} bitter. Leaves of the curry tree (Murraya koenigii) are eaten, those of kaffir lime (Citrus × hystrix) (e.g., Thai food) and Ailanthus (e.g., in Korean dishes such as bugak) {{and those of the}} European bay tree (Laurus nobilis) and the California bay tree (Umbellularia californica) are used for flavouring food. Camellia sinensis, the source of tea, is a small tree but seldom reaches its full height, being heavily pruned to make picking the leaves easier.|$|E
5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. In fact, I {{think one of the}} greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> totalitarians, which means that they tend to destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, are you willing to create and live in a civil society, in an open society, or not? That to me is the basic issue.|$|E
5000|$|While [...] "Multiple Occupancy" [...] was {{basically}} a cheap housing alternative, there were some self-described spiritual communities that shared particular values, like Bodhi Farm and Darmananda, but <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> closer <b>to</b> the neighbouring The Channon and Terania Creek than Nimbin.|$|R
50|$|The {{volume of}} diesel cars in {{circulation}} in 1970 was very low, {{perhaps because the}} vehicles themselves <b>were</b> generally slow <b>to</b> start, noisy, smoky, and with sluggish performance, <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> confined <b>to</b> Europe’s taxi ranks, rather than appealing to the mainstream buyer.|$|R
50|$|The book portrays them as personifying {{an ideal}} of statesmanship marked by nonpartisanship, pragmatic internationalism, and aversion <b>to</b> ideological fervor. <b>They</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> practical, realistic, and nonideological. After the six had retired from public life, they and other like-minded {{establishment}} elders were dubbed The Wise Men.|$|R
5|$|Indium has no {{metabolic}} role in any organism. In {{a similar}} way to aluminium salts, indium(III) ions can be toxic to the kidney when given by injection. Indium tin oxide and indium phosphide harm the pulmonary and immune systems, predominantly through ionic indium, though hydrated indium oxide is more than forty times as toxic when injected, measured by the quantity of indium introduced. Radioactive indium-111 (in very small amounts on a chemical basis) is used in nuclear medicine tests, as a radiotracer to follow the movement of labeled proteins and white blood cells in the body. Indium compounds are mostly not absorbed upon ingestion and are only moderately absorbed on inhalation; <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stored temporarily in the muscles, skin, and bones before being excreted, and the biological half-life of indium is about two weeks in humans.|$|E
5|$|Many {{animals and}} plants have taken up {{residence}} in urban environments. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> adaptable generalists and use the town's features to make their homes. Rats and mice have followed man around the globe, pigeons, peregrines, sparrows, swallows and house martins use the buildings for nesting, bats use roof space for roosting, foxes visit the garbage bins and squirrels, coyotes, raccoons and skunks roam the streets. About 2,000 coyotes are thought to live in and around Chicago. A survey of dwelling houses in northern European cities {{in the twentieth century}} found about 175 species of invertebrate inside them, including 53 species of beetle, 21 flies, 13 butterflies and moths, 13 mites, 9 lice, 7 bees, 5 wasps, 5 cockroaches, 5 spiders, 4 ants {{and a number of other}} groups. In warmer climates, termites are serious pests in the urban habitat; 183 species are known to affect buildings and 83 species cause serious structural damage.|$|E
5|$|Mayflies are {{distributed}} {{all over the}} world in clean freshwater habitats, though absent from Antarctica. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> absent from oceanic islands or represented by one or two species that have dispersed from nearby mainland. Female mayflies may be dispersed by wind, and eggs may be transferred by adhesion to the legs of waterbirds. The greatest generic diversity is found in the Neotropic ecozone, while the Holarctic has a smaller number of genera but a high degree of speciation. Some thirteen families are restricted to a single bioregion. The main families have some general habitat preferences: the Baetidae favour warm water; the Heptageniidae live under stones and prefer fast-flowing water; and the relatively large Ephemeridae make burrows in sandy lake or river beds.|$|E
50|$|Throughout this period, Microsoft Windows {{was first}} {{starting}} its rise in popularity. Cross-platform development systems had <b>been</b> developed, but <b>to</b> this time <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> relatively simple, delivering least-common-denominator applications. A cross-platform system that delivered first-rate solutions {{was something of}} a holy grail during this time.|$|R
5000|$|Red lake {{pigments}} were {{an important}} part of the palette of 16th century Venetian painters, particularly Titian, but they were used in all periods. [...] Since the red lakes were made from organic dyes, <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fugitive, becoming unstable and fading when exposed to sunlight.|$|R
50|$|In state politics, {{they were}} strong {{supporters}} of state colleges and universities, low tuition, and large research budgets. They favored infrastructure improvements, such as highway projects. In foreign policy, <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Hamiltonian, espousing internationalist and realist policies, supporting the United Nations, and promoting American business interests abroad.|$|R
