We investigated the effect of DSB repair on instability of the (GAA•TTC) n sequence. Linear plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli so that each colony represented an individual DSB repair event. Repair of a DSB within <b>the</b> <b>repeat</b> resulted in {{a dramatic increase in}} deletions compared with circular templates, but DSB repair outside <b>the</b> <b>repeat</b> tract did not affect instability.

This is consistent with a single-strand annealing mechanism of DSB repair, and implicates erroneous DSB repair as a mechanism for genetic instability of the (GAA•TTC) n sequence.

40|$|In Drosophila melanogaster {{the five}} histone genes are within a 5 -kilobase region which is {{repeated}} 100 times {{at a single}} chromosomal site.

In this study, we assessed their transcriptional activity by measuring in vivo the relative amounts of RNA polymerase II that were cross-linked by UV irradiation to the two different histone <b>repeats.</b> <b>The</b> RNA polymerase II density on <b>the</b> long <b>repeat</b> in Schneider line 2 cells was strikingly lower (10 -fold) than the density on <b>the</b> short <b>repeat.</b> <b>The</b> magnitude of this difference cannot {{be accounted for by}} reduced transcription of only one or two genes of <b>the</b> <b>repeat.</b> <b>The</b> density of topoisomerase I, an indicator of transcriptional activity, was also much higher on <b>the</b> short <b>repeat</b> than on <b>the</b> long <b>repeat</b> of line 2 cells.

30|$|Frankly speaking, it is {{not easy}} to {{discover}} the valuable knowledge from our real life. For this issue, the past studies made on knowledge discovery can be categorized two classifications, namely, algorithm-driven and application-driven studies. Algorithm-driven studies focused on how to increase the efficiency, while the application-driven ones focused on how to successfully apply the mining algorithms to applications. In this paper, on one hand, we propose an efficient mining algorithm to discover <b>the</b> <b>repeating</b> patterns. On <b>the</b> other hand, an application for music recommendation is lifted to justify the motivation of pattern mining. In terms of mining algorithm, first, we construct an informative index called QPI containing positions and occurrences of patterns. It can effectively reduce the cost of mining of repeating patterns. By QPI, a prefix-search-based algorithm named FMRP performs efficiently on mining <b>the</b> <b>repeating</b> patterns. In terms of application, a music recommender system based on <b>the</b> <b>repeating</b> patterns is proposed to cope with problems in traditional recommender systems. The main intent is to link the user preferences and <b>the</b> <b>repeating</b> patterns on music. The experimental results reveal that our proposed mining algorithm is more efficient than the compared methods on different data. Moreover, the proposed recommender system based on <b>the</b> <b>repeating</b> patterns performs more effective in facing very sparse data.
