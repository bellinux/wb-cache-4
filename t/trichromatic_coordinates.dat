40|$|International audienceThe diffuse {{reflectance}} spectra and the <b>trichromatic</b> <b>coordinates</b> of diffusing stratified paints are modeled. Each layer contains its own pigments, and their optical properties are first determined from experiments. The radiative transfer equation is then solved by the auxiliary function method for modeling the total light scattered by the stratified systems. The {{results are in}} good agreement with experimental spectra and validate the modeling. The calculations are then applied on the same stratified systems to study {{the influence of the}} observation angle in a bidirectional configuration and to study the influence of the thickness of the layers in a given configuration. In both cases, the reflectance spectra and the <b>trichromatic</b> <b>coordinates</b> are calculated and compared...|$|E

40|$|Doped TiO 2 /graphene nanocomposites are studied due {{to their}} {{capacity}} to absorb the visible rays and large applicability in photo-catalytic applications. In this paper, we summarize our experiments {{on the development of}} photocatalytic fabrics based on deposition of doped TiO 2 /graphene nanocomposites by ultrasound method. We have investigated the surface morphology by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and elemental composition was determinate through EDX. Other information were obtained from electrical resistivity analysis measured on Prostat PRS- 801 instrument, evaluation of the cotton fabrics wettability by measuring the contact angle on a VCA Optima instrument and evaluation of the photo-catalytic properties of the treated fabrics under solar and visible light (Xenotest) by measuring the <b>trichromatic</b> <b>coordinates</b> of the treated and untreated textile materials. The results demonstrated that the ultrasound is an effective method to deposit nanoparticles on textile materials and that the uniform dispersion of TiO 2 - graphene composites depends on sonication parameters. Also, the treatment used on textile materials doesn’t improve the electrical properties of the knit. The results obtain after evaluation of the photo-catalytic activity by photo degradation of methylene blue under visible and solar light show the performance of the developed fabrics and also that the photo-catalytic activity is high under visible light and solar light...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to demonstrate the treatment durability at washing of N-TiO 2 layers applied on cotton fabrics by padding and to investigate the particle adherence and morphology of the textile surface. After 5 washing cycles, the cotton fibers are covered with {{a high number of}} particles, which demonstrate that the particle adherence to the substrate is high, most of them being present as large clusters. Also, the washing process does not affect in an important manner the polymer layer, only from place to place the cotton knit beeing disrupted. To evaluate the photocatalytic effect of the materials after washing treatment, samples were exposed to ultraviolet and visible light. The <b>trichromatic</b> <b>coordinates</b> of the exposed and non-exposed samples were measured on Hunterlab spectrophotometer. The contradictories values are determined by the non-uniformities of the materials which don’t allowed a uniform dyeing of the fabrics. The obtained results showed that after 5 washings, the particles adherence to the substrate is still high and the photocatalytic effects are not significantly impaired. The photocatalytic efficiency of cotton knit treated with N-TiO 2 nanoparticles is higher under visible light than under UV light demonstrating the extension of the TiO 2 absorption in the visible range. ...|$|E
40|$|Our {{research}} {{was focused on}} the evaluation of the photocatalytic and antimicrobial properties, as well as biocompatibility of cotton fabrics coated with fresh and reused dispersions of nanoscaled TiO 2 - 1 % Fe-N particles prepared by the hydrothermal method and post-annealed at 400 °C. The powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Mössbauer spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The textiles coated with doped TiO 2 were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analyses, and their photocatalytic effect by <b>trichromatic</b> <b>coordinates</b> of the materials stained with methylene blue and coffee and exposed to UV, visible and solar light. The resulting doped TiO 2 consists of a mixture of prevailing anatase phase and a small amount (~ 15 %– 20 %) of brookite, containing Fe 3 + and nitrogen. By reusing dispersions of TiO 2 - 1 % Fe-N, high amounts of photocatalysts were deposited on the fabrics, and the photocatalytic activity was improved, especially under visible light. The treated fabrics exhibited specific antimicrobial features, which were dependent on their composition, microbial strain and incubation time. The in vitro biocompatibility evaluation on CCD- 1070 Sk dermal fibroblasts confirmed the absence of cytotoxicity after short-term exposure. These results highlight the potential of TiO 2 - 1 % Fe-N nanoparticles for further use in the development of innovative self-cleaning and antimicrobial photocatalytic cotton textiles. However, further studies are required in order to assess the long-term skin exposure effects and the possible particle release due to wearing...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMn 2 + doped Zn 3 (PO 4) 2 {{phosphate}} {{exhibits a}} rich thermal history with numerous events. Following the dehydration of Zn 3 (PO 4) 2 ⋅ 4 H 2 O hopeite at temperatures up to T = 400 °C, various allotropic forms α/δ → γ → β can be stabilized with irreversible transitions for a 600 °C ⩽ T ⩽ 1000 °C temperature range. Furthermore, in these different networks, {{a transition metal}} can occupy distorted tetrahedral (α/δ forms) and pentahedral sites as well as octahedral sites for the high-temperature γ and β forms that correspond to non-centrosymmetric environments. Depending on the thermal history of the samples, {{two different types of}} emission spectra were obtained. By increasing the annealing temperature, the green emission associated with Mn 2 + in a Td environment progressively disappears in favor of the red one that corresponds to Mn 2 + stabilized in fivefold and sixfold coordination sites. There is also a dependence of the emission color on the excitation wavelength arising from the differences in the excitation spectra of Mn 2 + in these two types of sites. Excitations in the oxygen-manganese charge transfer band at 250 nm or in the 3 d– 3 d absorption region at 420 nm give rise to the red or green emission at 420 nm, the green one being enhanced for an excitation at 420 nm. The α/δ → γ transition at 600 °C ⩽ T ⩽ 900 °C can easily be monitored in the emission spectra obtained after an excitation at 250 nm with a rather good chromatic contrast. The γ → β high-temperature transition at 900 °C ⩽ T ⩽ 1000 °C can be more easily followed by in the emission spectra obtained after an excitation at 420 nm. By taking into account both these emission spectra, various <b>trichromatic</b> <b>coordinates</b> can be calculated and allow subsequent phase transitions. The chromaticity of Zn 3 (PO 4) 2 : Mn 2 + will strongly change for 600 °C ⩽ T ⩽ 1000 °C, and one can consider this phosphate as an interesting thermal sensor...|$|E
