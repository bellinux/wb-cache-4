500|$|The izinDuna {{stayed in}} London {{throughout}} {{the month of}} March, attending a number of dinners in their honour, including one hosted by the Aborigines' Protection Society. The Society {{sent a letter to}} Lobengula, advising him to be [...] "wary and firm in resisting proposals that will not bring good <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> people". The diplomats saw many of the British capital's sights, including London Zoo, the Alhambra Theatre and the Bank of England. Their hosts showed them the spear of the Zulu king Cetshwayo, which now hung on a wall at Windsor Castle, and took them to Aldershot to observe military manoeuvres conducted by Major-General Evelyn Wood, the man who had given this spear to the Queen after routing the Zulus in 1879. Knutsford held two more meetings with the izinDuna, and during the second of these gave them the Queen's reply to Lobengula's letter, which mostly comprised vague assurances of goodwill. Satisfied with this, the emissaries sailed for home.|$|E
500|$|The {{standard}} of Rutherford's accommodation {{and his personal}} conduct attracted criticism from some Bible Students and Jehovah's Witnesses in the 1930s. Walter F. Salter, the Society's former branch manager in Canada, wrote a public letter to Rutherford in 1937, the month he was expelled from the group, claiming that Rutherford had exclusive use of [...] "luxurious" [...] and [...] "expensive" [...] residences (in Brooklyn, Staten Island, Germany, and San Diego), {{as well as two}} Cadillacs and alleged that {{on more than one occasion}} he had purchased for Rutherford cases of whiskey, brandy, beer and other liquors, and 'go from [...] "drink to drink"'. In July 1939 Olin R. Moyle, legal counsel for the Society, wrote an open letter of resignation to the president, in which he complained about behavior of some members of the Watch Tower Society, including Rutherford himself, that he considered excessive and inappropriate. Moyle mentioned California when discussing [...] "the difference between the accommodations furnished <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> personal attendants, compared with those furnished to some of your brethren." [...] Moyle also accused Rutherford of [...] "unkind treatment of the staff, outbursts of anger, discrimination and vulgar language" [...] and condemned his allowing the [...] "glorification of alcohol" [...] at Bethel. Penton notes that Moyle was a [...] "teetotaller" [...] and [...] "puritanical", but claims Rutherford's drinking habits were [...] "notorious" [...] and cites unnamed former Brooklyn Bethel workers who told of occasional difficulties in getting Rutherford to the podium to give public talks due to inebriation.|$|E
500|$|Some critics felt season 13 was an {{improvement}} over the previous Scully seasons. DVDDizzy rhetorically asked how the season [...] "stand up for someone just looking to jump into a full, semi-recent year of episodes", answering [...] "Pretty darn well". It explained [...] "Nearly everything that makes [...] "The Simpsons" [...] what it is can be found here. Most important is the large cast of Springfield residents used to perfection...Clearly, real thought and lots of it goes into each episode's creation", and added [...] "it's almost miraculous how fresh and sharp [...] "The Simpsons" [...] remains in its thirteenth year on air". The site explained [...] "Not every moment here is brilliant. After a rocky start, the season really hits its groove a few episodes in. Even though jokes don't always land, there are guaranteed {{to be at least}} a few amusing moments per episode. The stylings haven't changed all that much. There are tasteful homages and cultural references, including loving parodies of classic movies, television, and literature [...] as usual, tons of famous guest stars lend their voices, some as themselves and others as fictional characters". Adam Rayner of WhatCulture wrote that [...] "Season thirteen represents a time when the show was clinging to the classic humour that was derived from situations that were rooted in a reality – albeit a heightened reality – which could happen <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> family, while slowly descending into the surreal and farcical." [...] Matt Wheeldon of GoodFilmGuide said [...] "the 13th Season another solid, and fairly memorable, effort from the world’s best loved cartoon; even if it isn’t the be all and end all of Simpsons cartooning. DVD Talk's Ryan Keefer gave a season 3.5/5 stars and said [...] "While Jean might not have brought things to previous glory, he certainly righted the ship in Season 13." [...] Blu-Ray.com gave season 13 a 3.5/5 and Casey Broadwater's sentiment was [...] "The hit-to-miss ratio is much better here than in the previous three seasons, and while the episodes are never quite as hilarious as the Simpsons of old—from way back in the early 1990s—season 13 does mark a turning point for the series." [...] Ron Martin of 411 Mania was more critical giving the season a 6.5/10. Part of the verdict was [...] "Season 13 is representative of the chaotic scatterbrained nature the show would take on from here on out." [...] Casey Burchby of DVD Talk gave the season a 3/5 and wrote [...] "the thirteenth season is further proof of the regrettable change in comic tone that the series took on {{in the early part of}} the last decade." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rutherford {{moved into}} Beth Sarim in early 1930 {{and served as}} {{caretaker}} of the property awaiting {{the resurrection of the}} [...] "princes". Newspapers of the time reported on Rutherford's lavish lifestyle, which included a 16-cylinder Fisher Fleetwood Cadillac coupe. The residence was cited by Olin R. Moyle, former legal counsel for Jehovah's Witnesses, in a letter to Rutherford in 1939, as one of the examples of [...] "the difference between the accommodations furnished <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> personal attendants, compared with those furnished to some of your brethren". Walter F. Salter, former manager of the Canadian branch of the Watch Tower Society, also criticized Rutherford's use of Beth Sarim.

2500|$|On 13 May 1938, {{while riding}} his {{motorcycle}} {{down the streets}} of Tokyo, a very intoxicated Sorge clashed into a wall and was badly injured. As Sorge was carrying around notes {{given to him by}} Ozaki at the time, had the police discovered the documents his cover would have been blown, but a member of his spy ring was able to get the hospital to remove the documents before the police arrived. In 1938, Sorge reported to Moscow that the Battle of Lake Khasan was due to over-zealous officers in the Kwantung Army and there were no plans in Tokyo for a general war with the Soviet Union. Unaware that Berzin had been shot as a [...] "Trotskyite" [...] in July 1938, Sorge sent him a letter in October 1938 reading: [...] "Dear Comrade! Don't worry about us. Although we are terribly tired and tense, nevertheless we are disciplined, obedient, decisive and devoted fellows who are ready to carry out the tasks connected with our great mission. I send sincere greetings <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> friends. I request you to forward the attached letter and greetings to my wife. Please, take the time to see to her welfare".
