Von Müllenheim-Rechberg tried to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> was ignored, and later wondered whether this was due to combat fatigue or whether the disagreements with Lütjens had worn him down.|$|E

But if the surviving brother did not want to marry his brother’s widow, then the widow was to appear before the elders at the town gate and declare that the brother refused to perform the levir’s duty, the elders were to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> if he insisted, the widow was to go up to him before the elders, pull the sandal off his foot, spit in his face, and declare: [...] "Thus shall be done to the man who will not build up his brother’s house!"

2500|$|Many {{journalists and}} writers {{have written about}} Kishore Kumar's {{seemingly}} eccentric behavior. He placed {{a sign that said}} [...] "Beware of Kishore" [...] at the door of his Warden Road flat. Once, producer-director H. S. Rawail, who owed him some money, visited his flat to pay the dues. Kumar took the money and when Rawail offered to shake hands with him, reportedly Kishore put Rawail's hand in his mouth, bit it and asked [...] "Didn’t you see the sign?". Rawail laughed off the incident and left quickly. According to another reported incident, once Kumar was due to record a song for producer-director G. P. Sippy. As Sippy approached his bungalow, he saw Kumar going out in his car. Sippy asked Kumar to stop his car but Kumar increased his speed. Sippy chased him to Madh Island where Kumar finally stopped his car near the ruined Madh Fort. When Sippy questioned his strange behavior, Kumar refused to recognize or <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> threatened to call the police. The next morning, Kumar reported for the recording session. An angry Sippy questioned him about his behaviour the previous day but Kumar said that Sippy must have dreamt the incident and said that he was in Khandwa on the previous day.|$|E

60|$|Emily willingly {{promised to}} go, {{and she went}} on <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> telling <b>him</b> whom he was to meet on the next day, when an unusual silence making her look up, she beheld him more than half asleep.|$|R
60|$|Now Eric's {{strength}} {{came back}} <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> his heart {{opened in the}} light of Gudruda's eyes like a flower in the sunshine. For all day long she sat at his side, holding his hand <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> they found much to say.|$|R

6000|$|... "We, of course, <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>And</b> do {{you know}} what he said to me? 'What have we to do with Balkan intrigues? We must simply extirpate the scoundrels.'

6000|$|... "Oh, {{you will}} be sorry for him: I'm afraid he cries about {{something}} when I don't see him.
