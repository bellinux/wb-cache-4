There were two entrances on the main (south) facade, one at ground level and another on the balcony. The entrances had double wooden doors, paneled below and glazed above.

The building's interior contained a doubles court, two singles courts, a reception room, locker rooms, showers, and a spectators' gallery seating 150.

40|$|We analyse two {{possible}} definitions of <b>the</b> <b>squashed</b> entanglement in an infinite-dimensional bipartite system: direct {{translation of the}} finite-dimensional definition and its universal extension.

Is also shown that the second definition gives an adequate extension of this measure to the set of all states of infinite-dimensional bipartite system. A general condition relating continuity of <b>the</b> <b>squashed</b> entanglement to continuity of the quantum mutual information is proved and its corollaries are considered.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>squashed</b> {{entanglement}} is {{a fundamental}} entanglement measure in quantum information theory, finding application as an upper bound on the distillable secret key or distillable entanglement of a quantum state or a quantum channel.
