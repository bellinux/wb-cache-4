These binaries are classified as low-mass or high-mass according to {{the mass of the}} donor star. High-mass X-ray binaries contain a young, early-type, high-mass donor star which transfers mass by its stellar wind, while low-mass X-ray binaries are semidetached binaries in which gas from a late-type donor star or a white dwarf overflows the Roche lobe and falls towards the neutron star or black hole. Probably the best known example of an X-ray binary is the high-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-1. In Cygnus X-1, the mass of the unseen companion is estimated to be about nine times that of the Sun, far exceeding the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit for the maximum <b>theoretical</b> <b>mass</b> of a neutron star.

50|$|Mascot {{identifies}} proteins by interpreting {{mass spectrometry}} data. The prevailing experimental method for protein identification is a bottom-up approach, where a protein sample is typically digested with Trypsin to form smaller peptides. While most proteins are too big, peptides usually {{fall within the}} limited mass range that a typical mass spectrometer can measure. Mass spectrometers measure the molecular weights of peptides in a sample. Mascot then compares these molecular weights against a database of known peptides. The program cleaves every protein in the specified search database in silico according to specific rules depending on the cleavage enzyme used for digestion and calculates the <b>theoretical</b> <b>mass</b> for each peptide. Mascot then computes a score based on {{the probability that the}} peptides from a sample match those in the selected protein database. The more peptides Mascot identifies from a particular protein, the higher the Mascot score for that protein.|$|E

50|$|When {{a binary}} system {{contains}} a compact object {{such as a}} white dwarf, neutron star or black hole, gas from the other (donor) star can accrete onto the compact object. This releases gravitational potential energy, causing the gas to become hotter and emit radiation. Cataclysmic variable stars, where the compact object is a white dwarf, are examples of such systems.In X-ray binaries, the compact object can be either a neutron star or a black hole.

50|$|Artificial cell hemoperfusion {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a less costly and more efficient detoxifying option than hemodialysis, in which blood filtering takes place only through size separation by a physical membrane. In hemoperfusion, thousands of adsorbent artificial cells are retained inside a small container {{through the use of}} two screens on either end through which patient blood perfuses. As the blood circulates, toxins or drugs diffuse into the cells and are retained by the absorbing material. The membranes of artificial cells are much thinner those used in dialysis and their small size means that they have a high membrane surface area. This means that a portion of cell can have a <b>theoretical</b> <b>mass</b> transfer that is a hundredfold higher than that of a whole artificial kidney machine. The device has been established as a routine clinical method for patients treated for accidental or suicidal poisoning but has also been introduced as therapy in liver failure and kidney failure by carrying out part of the function of these organs.Artificial cell hemoperfusion has also been proposed for use in immunoadsorption through which antibodies can be removed from the body by attaching an immunoadsorbing material such as albumin {{on the surface of the}} artificial cells. This principle has been used to remove blood group antibodies from plasma for bone marrow transplantation and for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia through monoclonal antibodies to remove low-density lipoproteins. Hemoperfusion is especially useful in countries with a weak hemodialysis manufacturing industry as the devices tend to be cheaper there and used in kidney failure patients.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{particle}} {{is represented}} by the wave packet in nonlinear space-time continuum. Because of dispersion, the packet periodically appears and disappears in movement and the envelope of the process coincides with the wave function. There was considered the partial differential equation of telegraph-type describing the motion of such wave packet in spherical coordinate space. There was constructed also the analytical solution of this equation and the integral over all space of square of the gradient was supposed being equal to the mass of the particle identified with the wave packet. As the solution depends on two parameter L,m being positive integer, it was possible to calculate our theoretical particle masses for different L,m.

40|$|A {{model of}} random mass-matching {{and its use}} for {{automated}} significance testing in mass spectrometric proteome analysis A rapid and accurate method for testing the significance of protein identities deter-mined by mass spectrometric analysis of protein digests and genome database searching is presented. The method is based on direct computation using a statistical model of the random matching of measured and <b>theoretical</b> proteolytic peptide <b>masses.</b> Protein identification algorithms typically rank the proteins of a genome data-base according to a score {{based on the number}} of matches between the masses obtained by mass spectrometry analysis and the <b>theoretical</b> proteolytic peptide <b>masses</b> of a database protein. The random matching of experimental and <b>theoretical</b> <b>masses</b> can cause false results. A result is significant only if the score characterizing the result deviates significantly from the score expected from a false result. A distrib-ution of the score (number of matches) for random (false) results is computed directly from our model of the random matching, which allows significance testing under any experimental and database search constraints. In order to mimic protein identification data quality in large-scale proteome projects, low-to-high quality proteolytic peptide mass data were generated in silico and subsequently submitted to a database search program designed to include significance testing based on direct computation. This simulation procedure demonstrates the usefulness of direct significance testing for automatically screening for samples that must be subjected to peptide sequence ana-lysis by e. g. tandem mass spectrometry in order to determine the protein identity...|$|R

This follows from the atom-like structure of baryons. Applying the modified quantum chromodynamics, within the S-SET, we can calculate the masses of quarks. This leads to conclusion that S-SET is the superior theory to the Standard Model in initial conditions. Calculated mass of b quark is 4190 MeV. Here, I showed that the Type 1 S Upsilon meson is both a structure containing b-b(anti) quark pair (<b>theoretical</b> <b>mass</b> of such structure is 9460. 1 MeV), or mesonic nucleus (<b>theoretical</b> <b>mass</b> of such nucleus is 9465. 1 MeV).
