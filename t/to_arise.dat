5|$|From the 1960s, {{the rates}} of lung {{adenocarcinoma}} started to rise relative to other types of lung cancer. This {{is partly due to}} the introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive the same amount of nicotine, increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends <b>to</b> <b>arise.</b> The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma continues to rise.|$|E

In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating power. He demonstrated that this radiation, unlike phosphorescence, did not depend on an external source of energy but seemed <b>to</b> <b>arise</b> spontaneously from uranium itself. Influenced by these two important discoveries, Marie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.|$|E

5|$|Telangiectasias and {{arteriovenous}} malformations in HHT {{are thought}} <b>to</b> <b>arise</b> because {{of changes in}} angiogenesis, the development of blood vessels out of existing ones. The {{development of a new}} blood vessel requires the activation and migration of various types of cells, chiefly endothelium, smooth muscle and pericytes. The exact mechanism by which the HHT mutations influence this process is not yet clear, and it is likely that they disrupt a balance between pro- and antiangiogenic signals in blood vessels. The wall of telangiectasias is unusually friable, which explains the tendency of these lesions to bleed.|$|E

Microbes are likely to benefit from the increase in nutrient-enriched environmental niches. No new species of existing large vertebrates are likely <b>to</b> <b>arise</b> and food chains will probably be shortened.|$|E

5|$|Around this time, {{tensions}} began <b>to</b> <b>arise</b> {{between what}} {{was perceived as}} president Núñez's dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group, Boixos Nois. The group, identified with a left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of Núñez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in skinheads, who often identified with a right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois' ideology from liberalism to fascism, which caused division within the group and a sudden support for Núñez's presidency. Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.|$|E
5|$|At {{therapeutic}} doses, amphetamine causes {{emotional and}} cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control.

Very high doses can result in psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia) which rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use.
