25|$|Kirkman {{published}} many early novels, {{including many}} translated from French and Spanish. In 1652 he published The Loves and Adventures of Clerio and Lozia, which he also claimed was translated from French. One {{of his greatest}} successes was a novel, The English Rogue {{the first volume of}} which was written by Richard Head, and published in 1665. In 1666 Kirkman re-issued <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> wrote a second volume in his own name (1668), followed by a third and fourth (1671), claiming Head as a co-author. In 1673 Kirkman wrote and issued under his own name The Counterfeit Lady Unveiled, a fictional autobiography of Mary Carleton, an impostor and bigamist. He also published other popular romances, such as The Famous and Delectable History of Don Bellianus of Greece, (1671–1674), The Seven Wise Masters of Rome (1674).|$|E

25|$|Citizens of the United States are {{entitled}} to a host of social benefits. Government programs such as Food Stamps and Medicaid can provide support for low-income families. However, children who are U.S. citizens may not always be able to fully enjoy these benefits. Immigrant parents with limited English language ability may be unaware they are eligible for such benefits, or may not know how to take advantage of social welfare programs. Even legal non-citizens may find that their access to social supports is restricted due to welfare reforms. In addition, parents who are undocumented may be afraid to deal with government agencies, even if their citizen children are eligible for such assistance programs. When there is risk of deportation, it affects the likelihood of a mixed-status mother's use social services. The anti-immigrant sentiment increases <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> would deter mixed-status mothers to not to participate in government programs in which their U.S. born children are eligible to receive.|$|E
25|$|On 26 June 1954, Douglas DC-3 was hijacked {{by members}} of the Karen National Defense Organization (KNDO, later the Karen National Liberation Army). After the killing of Saw Ba U Gyi in 1950, the first {{president}} of the Karen National Union (KNU), the group sought to regain both a political initiative and financial leverage. Three KNDO members - Major Saw Kyaw Aye, Captain Thein Kyaw and Captain A Nyein - planned to hijack a plane, and use it to smuggle illegal weapons. They successfully hijacked the plane, and forced its British pilot Captain A.E. Hare to land on a deserted beach, after other group members had failed to build a suitable temporary runway in Karen. Finding 700,000 Burmese kyat in metal chests in the cargo, cash being transported between bank branches, they confiscated <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> let the plane take off. Censorship banned reporting of the story for over 50 years, but in April 2014 it was the subject of the book The World's First Hijacking, and is being developed into a Hollywood-produced film under the same title.|$|E

Kushner also stated it was then unknown what Velvet Revolver's plans were for the future after the reunion show; [...] "I know everyone’s got other commitments, but I think everyone’s like, 'Let’s get this thing done and get through <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> we’ll see.'".|$|E

Soderbergh also noted Mitch's [...] "common individual" [...] lack of medical and scientific knowledge, though keeping the situation dynamic and compelling was challenging for the director, as he was concerned that Emhoff would be a one-dimensional character. Soderbergh felt that Damon understood the concept and addressed the producers' concerns. [...] "You never catch him acting", said Soderbergh. [...] "There's no vanity, no self-consciousness in his performance; it's as if the cameras aren't there." [...] Writer Scott Z. Burns sent him a copy of the script with a [...] "read <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> go wash your hands" [...] note attached to it. Damon recalled: [...] "I just really want to be in this movie. It was a terrific, riveting, really fast read and really exciting and really horrifying, but managed to be really touching." ...|$|E
500|$|As the {{recording}} sessions progressed, Wim Wenders approached {{the band and}} asked them for a song for his next film, Faraway, So Close!. The Edge said [...] "we heard Wim Wenders {{was looking for a}} song... so I had a go at finishing it." [...] U2 watched the film, Faraway, So Close!, for inspiration on how to craft the song. Bono said [...] "the film was about angels who want to be human and who want to be on Earth. But to do so they have to become mortal. That was a great image to play with- the impossibility of wanting something like <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the cost of having it." [...] Two versions of the song were crafted; the first was released on Zooropa, and the second, almost two minutes longer and featuring [...] "an edgier guitar and drum performance," [...] was included on the Faraway, So Close! soundtrack. Close to the completion of {{the recording}} Bono renamed the song [...] "Stay." [...] Wanting to further reference the Wenders film he then changed it once more, to [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)".|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} couple of months, they were merely [...] "killing time", {{according}} to Robertson, with many early sessions devoted to covers. [...] "With the covers Bob was educating us a little", recalls Robertson. [...] "The whole folkie thing was still very questionable to us—it wasn't the train we came in on. ... He'd come up with something like 'Royal Canal', and you'd say, 'This is so beautiful! The expression!' ... He remembered too much, remembered too many songs too well. He'd come over to Big Pink, or wherever we were, and pull out some old song—and he'd prepped for this. He'd practiced <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> come out here, to show us." [...] Songs recorded at the early sessions included material written or made popular by Johnny Cash, Ian & Sylvia, John Lee Hooker, Hank Williams and Eric Von Schmidt, as well as traditional songs and standards. Linking all the recordings, both new material and old, {{is the way in which}} Dylan re-engaged with traditional American music. Biographer Barney Hoskyns observed that both the seclusion of Woodstock and the discipline and sense of tradition in The Hawks' musicianship were just what Dylan needed after the [...] "globe-trotting psychosis" [...] of the 1965–66 tour. Continued recording at the Big Pink was impossible because of the fanbase that had built up around Dylan. He even reported finding a couple in his bed once.|$|E

500|$|Composer Tim Larkin, a sound {{designer}} and audio director at Cyan {{who had previously}} worked on realMyst and , was given the task of developing Myst Vs musical score. Larkin stated that whereas earlier Myst games had been constrained by technological limitations, the available technology allowed End of Ages {{to have a more}} dynamic environment, with the music changing with various timings of different sound effects. Surround sound provided a more realistic and immersive gameplay experience. A major challenge in writing the music was that the score had to be flexible enough to match the non-linear gameplay events. [...] "Games are totally interactive experiences," [...] Larkin explained. [...] "You don't guide a player through, since you can't count on being at a certain place at a certain time. I can't write cue music to get the player to do this, <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> this. One player might hear the cue and run the other way!" [...] Larkin had to step away from what he had learned as a jazz composer and musician writing pieces with a definite beginning and end, instead creating music with [...] "less arc" [...] and structure. Larkin admitted that some Myst fans would have preferred a musical style similar to Robyn Miller's scores for Myst and Riven, but replied by saying that change happens and players would find something to like in the new music if they kept an open mind.|$|E

2500|$|The {{hand drill}} {{is a similar}} tool, but uses a longer, thinner spindle; and instead of a bearing block and bow combination, the {{downward}} pressure and spinning is achieved by rubbing the hands together around the spindle. As the hands move downward to the base, where the drill is pinched and the hands are brought quickly to the top one at a time. This can be made unnecessary by cutting a nock {{at the top of}} the drill, tying a cord through <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> putting your thumbs through loops in the cord. However, skilled operators can either maintain pressure with their hands almost stationary vertically; or, in a movement comparable to floating, can [...] "float" [...] their hands back to the top of the drill. There is a more limited choice of materials to use with this method, needing much softer materials, such as mullein, yucca, cattail, and root wood.|$|E
2500|$|The {{chief of}} these were On Apostasy (1676), a sad account of {{religion}} under the Restoration; On the Holy Spirit (1677-1678) and The Doctrine of Justification (1677). In 1680, however, Stillingfleet having on 11 May preached his sermon on [...] "The Mischief of Separation," [...] Owen defended the Nonconformists from the charge of schism in his Brief Vindication. Baxter and Howe also answered Stillingfleet, who replied in The Unreasonableness of Separation. Owen again answered <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> left the controversy to a swarm of eager combatants. From this time to his death he was occupied with continual writing, disturbed only by suffering from kidney stones and asthma, and by the absurd charge of being concerned in the Rye House Plot. His most important work was his Treatise on Evangelical Churches, in which were contained his latest views regarding church government. He died at Ealing, just twenty-one years after he had gone out with so many others on St Bartholomew's day in 1662, and was buried on 4 September 1683 in Bunhill Fields.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 March Eastern Army HQ ordered Wingate to {{withdraw}} his units back to India. Wingate and his senior commanders considered {{a number of}} options to achieve this but all were threatened {{by the fact that}} with no major army offensive in progress, the Japanese would be able to focus their attention on destroying the Chindit force. Eventually they agreed to retrace their steps to the Irrawaddy, since the Japanese would not expect <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> disperse to make attacks on the enemy as they returned to the Chindwin. By mid-March the Japanese had three infantry divisions chasing the Chindits, who were eventually trapped inside the bend of the Shweli River by Japanese forces. [...] Unable to cross the river intact and still reach British lines, the Chindits was forced to split into small groups to evade enemy forces. [...] The Japanese paid great attention to preventing air resupply of Chindit columns, as well as hindering their mobility by removing boats from the Irrawaddy, Chindwin and Mu rivers and actively patrolling the river banks. Continually harassed by the Japanese, the force returned to India by various routes during the spring of 1943 in groups ranging from single individuals to whole columns: some directly, others via a roundabout route from China. Casualties were high; the force lost approximately one-third of its total strength.|$|E
