5|$|Athletes have {{historically}} been willing to take legal and health risks to improve their performance, with some even stating their willingness to risk their lives, as exemplified by research by Mirkin, Goldman and Connor in researching attitudes to the so-called Goldman dilemma. To prevent use of performance-enhancing substances, athletes must submit to drug tests that are conducted {{both in and out}} of competition by anti-doping officials or accredited medical staff. Penalized athletes are susceptible to higher testing upon return to competition. Athletes found to have taken substances on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned list receive sanctions and may be banned from competition for a period of time that corresponds to the seriousness of the infraction. However, the use of substances not on the prohibited list may also result in sanctions if the substance is deemed similar to a banned substance in either composition or effect. Athletes may also be sanctioned for missing tests, seeking to avoid testing or <b>tampering</b> <b>with</b> results, refusing to submit to testing, through circumstantial evidence, or confession of use.|$|E

Christine flees to the roof with Raoul. She reveals to him that she has seen the Phantom's face and fears him, but also pities him because of his sadness. Raoul tells Christine he loves her and will protect her forevermore. Christine returns his love, kissing him passionately and they both leave the roof. The Phantom, who witnessed the scene, becomes heartbroken. He then hears them both singing together. Growing furious at Raoul, he vows revenge on them both.|$|E

Jake and a county prosecutor tell Keith that they will get a judge's order and will return to prosecute Veronica. The supercomputer processes the names of all the Castle members just as Keith hands over the surveillance tape to the county prosecutor. Logan tries to apologize to Veronica. One of the Castle members comes up and tells her that the organization videotaped her, and Logan assaults him. Veronica returns the tape to Jake Kane on the condition that he does not tell Keith about it. She sees in the newspaper that charges have been filed against Keith for <b>tampering</b> <b>with</b> evidence relating to Veronica's break-in, likely meaning that he will lose the votes needed to win the sheriff's election. She goes into a voting booth and votes for Keith as sheriff, walking away in pouring rain.|$|E
5|$|The Resistance execute {{an attack}} on a Nazi {{research}} facility in London, bombing their base of operations, stealing secret documents and prototype stealth helicopters. The documents reveal the Nazis are relying on reverse-engineered technology derived from an ancient organization known as Da'at Yichud, which created such inventions as energy weapons, computer AI's, and super concrete; however, it is also revealed that someone is <b>tampering</b> <b>with</b> the super concrete's formula, making it susceptible to mold deterioration. The Resistance discover a match with Da'at Yichud member Set Roth (Mark Ivanir), who is imprisoned in a forced labor camp. Blazkowicz agrees to go undercover inside the camp and meets Set, who tells him that the Nazis have been using technology made by him and other Jewish scientists to mass-produce and control robots, and offers to help the Resistance in return for the destruction of the labor camp. Blazkowicz finds a battery for a device that controls the camp robots, which he and Set then use to destroy the camp and rescue prisoners.|$|E

5|$|Dot {{receives}} a police visit, informing her that Nick has died. One {{of the police}} officers returns later {{to tell her that}} he is actually her grandson Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett), a child of Nick's Dot had not known existed. A devastated Dot holds a funeral for Nick and grows close to Charlie in the aftermath as he moves in with Dot, causing Fatboy to move out. However, it is later revealed that Charlie is being dishonest and although he is Nick's son, he is not a policeman but a caretaker and that he has helped Nick stage his own death to avoid being arrested following a robbery. Nick reappears in Walford to Dot's shock and persuades his mother to hide him at her house. Although horrified that Charlie and Nick lied to her, she forgives Charlie and agrees to aid Nick's escape from the UK, this time for good. However, Nick later realises that {{he does not want to}} leave and gets embroiled in a feud with Charlie's fiancée Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) who tries and fails to ensure his departure. This leads to Nick <b>tampering</b> <b>with</b> the brakes of Charlie's car and the resulting crash leaves a pregnant Ronnie comatose in hospital. When Charlie discovers this, he demands that Nick leave, and as Charlie moves out to live at Ronnie's flat, Fatboy moves back in with Dot. However, Dot, unwilling to give up on her son, hides Nick in a derelict neighbouring house.|$|E
5|$|Sources for William's actions between 1082 and 1084 are meagre. According to the {{historian}} David Bates, this probably means that little happened of note, and that because William {{was on the}} continent, {{there was nothing for}} the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to record. In 1082 William ordered the arrest of his half-brother Odo. The exact reasons are unclear, as no contemporary author recorded what caused the quarrel between the half-brothers. Orderic Vitalis later recorded that Odo had aspirations to become pope. Orderic also related that Odo had attempted to persuade some of William's vassals to join Odo on an invasion of southern Italy. This would have been considered <b>tampering</b> <b>with</b> the king's authority over his vassals, which William would not have tolerated. Although Odo remained in confinement for the rest of William's reign, his lands were not confiscated. More difficulties struck in 1083, when William's eldest son Robert rebelled once more with support from the French king. A further blow was the death of Matilda, William's wife, on 2 November 1083. William was always described as close to his wife, and her death would have added to his problems.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee's {{defense was}} prized for its success against opponents' passing game. In 2009, the Volunteers were 10th nationally against the pass, {{permitting}} {{an average of}} 165.92 yards per game. Against the run, they were 58th. When both facets were combined, the defense was 16th, permitting an average of 308.83 yards per game. Much {{of the reason for}} Tennessee's success against the pass was star safety Eric Berry, only the second player in Tennessee history to be named a unanimous All-American twice. He won the Jim Thorpe Award, given each year to the best defensive back in the nation. Joining Berry in the defensive secondary was Janzen Jackson, who returned to the field following three missed games caused by his alleged involvement in an armed robbery. Countering Jackson's return, Tennessee lost defensive back Brent Vinson, who was dismissed from the team for reasons unrevealed at the time. Two months after the Chick-fil-A Bowl, Vinson was charged with <b>tampering</b> <b>with</b> evidence related to a murder investigation. Tennessee defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin, interviewed 10 days before the game, said Virginia Tech's offensive strength presented problems for Tennessee.|$|E

5|$|Roddenberry {{had first}} {{proposed}} a Star Trek feature at the 1968 World Science Fiction Convention. The movie {{was to have}} been set before the television series, showing how the crew of the Enterprise met. The popularity of the syndicated Star Trek caused Paramount and Roddenberry to begin developing the film in May 1975. Roddenberry was allocated $3 to $5 million to develop a script. By June 30, he had produced what he considered an acceptable script, but studio executives disagreed. This first draft, , featured a grounded Admiral Kirk assembling the old crew on the refitted Enterprise to clash with a godlike entity many miles across, hurtling towards Earth. The object {{turns out to be a}} super-advanced computer, the remains of a scheming race who were cast out of their dimension. Kirk wins out, the entity returns to its dimension, and the Enterprise crew resumes their voyages. The basic premise and scenes such as a transporter accident and Spock's Vulcan ritual were discarded, but later returned to the final script. The film was postponed until spring (March/April) 1976 while Paramount fielded new scripts for Star Trek II (the working title) from acclaimed writers such as Ray Bradbury, Theodore Sturgeon and Harlan Ellison. Ellison's story had a snake-like alien race <b>tampering</b> <b>with</b> Earth's history to create a kindred race; Kirk reunites with his old crew, but they are faced with the dilemma of killing off the reptilian race in Earth's prehistory just to maintain humanity's dominance. When Ellison presented his idea, an executive suggested Ellison read Chariots of the Gods? and include the Maya civilization into his story, which enraged the writer because he knew Maya did not exist at the dawn of time. By October 1976, Robert Silverberg had been signed to work on the screenplay along with a second writer, John D. F. Black, whose treatment featured a black hole that threatened to consume all of existence. Roddenberry teamed up with Jon Povill to write a new story that featured the Enterprise crew setting an altered universe right by time travel; like Black's idea, Paramount did not consider it epic enough.|$|E
