5|$|One of {{the first}} major {{promoters}} of American theater was impresario P. T. Barnum, who began operating a lower Manhattan entertainment complex in 1841. The team of Harrigan and Hart produced a series of popular musical comedies in New York starting in the late 1870s. In the 20th century, the modern musical form emerged on Broadway; <b>the</b> <b>songs</b> <b>of</b> musical theater composers such as Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Stephen Sondheim have become pop standards. Playwright Eugene O'Neill won the Nobel literature prize in 1936; other acclaimed U.S. dramatists include multiple Pulitzer Prize winners Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, and August Wilson.|$|E
5|$|Over forty of {{the songs}} that Grossmith wrote or {{performed}} in his one-man shows have been recorded by baritone Leon Berger (a British Gilbert & Sullivan singer and Grossmith scholar), accompanied by Selwyn Tillett (G scholar) on two CDs: A Society Clown: <b>The</b> <b>Songs</b> <b>of</b> George Grossmith and The Grossmith Legacy.

Cups and Saucers was recorded by Retrospect Opera in 2016, together with F. C. Burnand and Edward Solomon's Pickwick.|$|E
5|$|Some species use {{vibrations}} {{for communicating}} within {{members of the}} same species, such as to attract mates as in <b>the</b> <b>songs</b> <b>of</b> the shield bug Nezara viridula. Vibrations {{can also be used to}} communicate between entirely different species; lycaenid (gossamer-winged butterfly) caterpillars, which are myrmecophilous (living in a mutualistic association with ants) communicate with ants in this way. The Madagascar hissing cockroach has the ability to press air through its spiracles to make a hissing noise as a sign of aggression; the death's-head hawkmoth makes a squeaking noise by forcing air out of their pharynx when agitated, which may also reduce aggressive worker honey bee behavior when the two are in close proximity.|$|E

5|$|Sullivan's most {{enduring}} orchestral work, the Overture di Ballo, was composed for the Birmingham Festival in 1870. Also in 1870, Sullivan met Gilbert. 1871 was a busy year for Sullivan. He published his only song cycle, The Window; or, <b>The</b> <b>Songs</b> <b>of</b> the Wrens, to words by Tennyson, {{and he wrote}} {{the first of a}} series of suites of incidental music for West End productions of Shakespeare plays. Still in 1871, Sullivan composed a dramatic cantata, On Shore and Sea, for the opening of the London International Exhibition, and the hymn Onward, Christian Soldiers, with words by Sabine Baring-Gould. The Salvation Army adopted the latter as its favoured processional, and it became Sullivan's {{most enduring}} hymn.|$|E
5|$|The {{blue whale}} rose from {{relative}} obscurity in the 1970s, {{after the release}} of <b>the</b> <b>Songs</b> <b>of</b> the Humpback Whale. The difference between the humpback and the blue whale was not well known to most people, who conflated the species in their minds. To many listeners, the haunting songs seemed like a cry for help. Environmentalists developed the image of a lonely blue whale singing out in an empty ocean, since whalers had nearly hunted the species to extinction.|$|E

5|$|Cetaceans are widespread, but some, as {{with the}} mysticetes, specialise in certain environments. Most mysticetes prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and migrate to the equator to give birth. Odontocetes feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like the killer whale, feed on mammals, such as pinnipeds. Gray whales are {{specialized}} for feeding on bottom-dwelling mollusks. Males typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate {{every two to three}} years. Calves are typically born {{in the spring and summer}} months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively long period of time. Some whales produce a variety of vocalizations, notably <b>the</b> <b>songs</b> <b>of</b> the humpback whale. Many species, mainly dolphins, are highly sociable, with some pods reaching over a thousand individuals.|$|E
