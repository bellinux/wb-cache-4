5|$|Bronchial {{injuries}} {{are divided into}} <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> accompanied by a disruption of the pleura and <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not; in the former, air can leak from {{the hole in the}} airway and a pneumothorax can form. The latter type is associated with more minor signs; pneumothorax is small if it occurs at all, and although function is lost in the part of the lung supplied by the injured bronchus, unaffected parts of the lungs may be able to compensate.|$|E
5|$|Individual benzodiazepines {{may have}} {{different}} interactions with certain drugs. Depending on their metabolism pathway, benzodiazepines can be divided roughly into two groups. The largest group consists of <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes and possess significant potential for interactions with other drugs. The other group comprises <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> metabolized through glucuronidation, such as lorazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam, and, in general, have few drug interactions.|$|E

5|$|The {{table lists}} hurricanes by death tolls. Direct deaths are <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{directly}} {{caused by the}} storm passage, such as drownings or deaths from being struck by windblown objects. Indirect deaths are <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> related to the storm, but not directly from its storm effects.|$|E
5|$|A {{flex fuel}} {{conversion}} kit is a kit {{that allows a}} conventional equipment manufactured vehicle to be altered to operate on propane, natural gas, methane gas, ethanol, or electricity are classified as aftermarket AFV conversions. All vehicle conversions, except <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> completed for a vehicle to run on electricity, must meet current applicable U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards.|$|E
5|$|Cultured mysids {{are thought}} to provide an ideal food source for many marine organisms. They are often fed to cephalopods, fish larvae, and {{commercial}} farmed shrimp due to their small size and low cost. Their high protein and fat content also makes them a good alternative to live enriched Artemia when feeding juveniles (especially <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> difficult to maintain such as young seahorses) and other small fauna.|$|E
50|$|Roman doctors {{separated}} {{mental disorders}} into two categories: <b>those</b> <b>that</b> could <b>be</b> cured, and <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> {{not of the}} body. Amongst the latter were addictions, most commonly vinolentia (alcoholism).|$|R
50|$|As {{a general}} rule, however, {{one can see}} in the Baroque an {{overwhelming}} preference for <b>those</b> instruments <b>that</b> <b>were</b> capable of carrying a melodic line alone: <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> louder and higher, that could achieve a variety of dynamics, and that lent themselves to virtuosic display and emotional expression, none of which the Renaissance instruments were designed to do. Lower-pitched instruments, <b>those</b> <b>that</b> could not vary dynamics, or <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> cumbersome, were deprecated. Thus, the supremacy of melody in the Baroque mind had wide-reaching consequences in the instrumental choices made by composers and makers.|$|R
50|$|This census {{recorded}} all {{inhabitants of}} Bačka {{that had to}} pay taxes to authorities, excluding <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not obligated to pay taxes (for example people {{that did not have}} their own house or people that served as soldiers in the military frontier) as well as <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> hiding from authorities with goal to avoid tax paying.|$|R
5|$|In the {{following}} table, the years {{correspond to the}} year of work's release; the ceremonies are always held {{the following}} year. Entries in bold and with a lavender background have won the relevant award; <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> neither highlighted nor in bold are the finalist nominees. Superscript letters after the result indicate simultaneous nominations in other categories, or other notes.|$|E
5|$|LARP {{events have}} {{a wide variety of}} styles that often overlap. Simple distinctions can be made {{regarding}} the genre used, the presence of simulated weapons or abstract rules, and whether players create their own characters or have them assigned by gamemasters. There is also a distinction between scenarios that are only run once and <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> designed to be repeatable. A number of other common classifications follow.|$|E
5|$|Living mammal {{species can}} be {{identified}} {{by the presence of}} sweat glands, including <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> specialized to produce milk to nourish their young. In classifying fossils, however, other features must be used, since soft tissue glands and many other features are not visible in fossils.|$|E

60|$|Our {{scheme for}} {{removing}} <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> sound from <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> sick {{was only in}} such houses as were infected, and confining the sick <b>was</b> no confinement; <b>those</b> <b>that</b> could not stir would not complain {{while they were in}} their senses and while they had the power of judging. Indeed, when they came to be delirious and light-headed, then they would cry out of the cruelty of being confined; but for the removal of <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> well, we thought it highly reasonable and just, for their own sakes, they should be removed from the sick, and that for other people's safety they should keep retired for a while, to see <b>that</b> they <b>were</b> sound, and might not infect others; and we thought twenty or thirty days enough for this.|$|R
5|$|More recent models {{attempt to}} model bubble dynamics, also usually by {{simplified}} models, {{to facilitate the}} computation of tables, and later to allow real time predictions during a dive. Models that approximate bubble dynamics are varied. They range from <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not much {{more complex than the}} dissolved phase models, to those that require considerably greater computational power.|$|E
5|$|Over 270 {{bird species}} have been {{observed}} in central Idaho, including 36 accidental species – <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not normally found in the region but have been observed {{on at least one}} occasion. Golden eagles and greater sage-grouse can be found over sagebrush steppe, whereas bald eagles can be seen along rivers. The Forest Service has listed northern goshawks, flammulated owls, and white-headed woodpeckers as a sensitive species in the forest.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{encounters}} at bathhouses are frequently, but not always, anonymous. Some {{feel that}} the anonymity adds to the erotic excitement: that is what, for these patrons, one goes to the bathhouse for. Bathhouse encounters sometimes lead to relationships, but usually do not. Bathhouses are still used by {{men who have sex}} with men and do not identify as gay or bisexual, including <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> closeted or in heterosexual relationships.|$|E

5|$|The {{components}} in an electric circuit {{can take many}} forms, which can include elements such as resistors, capacitors, switches, transformers and electronics. Electronic circuits contain active components, usually semiconductors, and typically exhibit non-linear behaviour, requiring complex analysis. The simplest electric components are <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> termed passive and linear: while they may temporarily store energy, they contain no sources of it, and exhibit linear responses to stimuli.|$|E
5|$|The {{invention}} of the Greek alphabet, as opposed to all previous systems, including the Phoenician, constituted an event {{in the history of}} human culture, the importance of which has not as yet been fully grasped.

5|$|Users of Microsoft Windows {{typically}} install one of {{the native}} binary distributions of Perl for Win32, most commonly Strawberry Perl or ActivePerl.

5|$|All sharks {{need to keep}} {{water flowing}} over their gills {{in order for them}} to breathe, however not all species need to be moving to do this. <b>Those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> able to breathe while not {{swimming}} do so by using their spiracles to force water over their gills, thereby allowing them to extract oxygen from the water. It has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this state and actively follow the movements of divers swimming around them and as such they are not truly asleep.|$|E
50|$|After the Restoration in 1660, all who {{had been}} active in the court that had tried and sentenced Charles I were targets for the new king.
