25|$|With Hooker's permission, on June 21, Pleasonton {{left two}} {{infantry}} brigades at Middleburg to guard {{his line of}} communications and took five cavalry brigades and Colonel (United States) Strong Vincent's infantry brigade to attack Stuart's five cavalry brigades near Upperville, Virginia. At the Battle of Upperville, Pleasonton's force drove Stuart's five brigades from the town and into Ashby's Gap. Pleasonton was satisfied with this result and did not <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> Stuart across the mountains. Stuart had kept Pleasonton from finding the Confederate infantry. Near nightfall, however, Brigadier General John Buford's scouts rode up a nearby ridge and spied Confederate infantry camps in the Shenandoah Valley. The minor Union victory at Upperville {{which resulted in the}} capture of one or two Confederate artillery pieces and about 250 Confederate prisoners also resulted in gathering some useful intelligence about the disposition of part of Lee's infantry The action also delayed the march of two infantry divisions of Lee's army in order for the Confederates to be sure to hold Ashby's Gap and to have a force available at Shepherdstown, West Virginia if Union troops moved toward the Shenandoah Valley and were able to break through. Stuart again came in for criticism in Southern newspapers for being surprised and defeated at Upperville.|$|E
25|$|Due to Southern Italy's lack of {{progress}} to bettering the area, it has {{a record number of}} emigration. This mentality stems from the sad truth that many who are native to Southern Italy find it more beneficial to emigrate rather than stay in the area and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> for reforms. The most prevalent issue in Southern Italy is its inability to attract businesses and therefore create jobs. Between 2007 and 2014 943,000 Italians were unemployed. Of this, 70% were Italians from the South. Employment in the South is ranked the lowest compared to countries in the European Union. The emerging issues discourage living in Southern Italy as even obtaining a job in the area is close to impossible. Naturally, Italians from the South are also ranked the lowest in terms of money contributed into the economy of the Italy from immigrants. The most common jobs in Southern Italy lie in tourism, distribution, food industries, wood furniture, whole sale, vehicle sales, sales in mineral and artisan. As evident in the list of the most common jobs in Southern Italy, the economy of the South heavily relies on tourism. It attracts tourists through its rich historical background. One example of this is Rome, {{one of the most prominent}} and advanced ancient civilizations.|$|E
500|$|Guest {{stars have}} {{appeared}} on SpongeBob SquarePants since its first season, {{in addition to the}} main cast, consisting of Tom Kenny, Bill Fagerbakke, Rodger Bumpass, Clancy Brown, Carolyn Lawrence and Mr. Lawrence, and supporting cast of Jill Talley, Mary Jo Catlett, Lori Alan, Dee Bradley Baker, Brian Doyle-Murray, Sirena Irwin, Bob Joles, Mark Fite and Thomas F. Wilson. Series creator Stephen Hillenburg in point of fact eschewed appearances by celebrities on the show, stating in an early interview, [...] "Honestly, I deliberately avoided that. The Simpsons is a tough act to follow, so I thought it was best not to do what they do," [...] referring to the copious number of The Simpsons guest stars. He added, [...] "But we've had a few exceptions." [...] According to Tom Kenny, main character SpongeBob's voice actor, [...] "One of the things networks always <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> is getting celebrities."

500|$|Before the album's release, in December 2012, Cudi {{dedicated}} Indicud to {{the late}} Ben Breedlove and all his fans who died, continuing: [...] "My journey shall continue in your honor. Never forgotten." [...] The dedication was ultimately included in the album's liner notes. The album is upbeat and optimistic, very much unlike his previous studio album [...] (2010), which was considered darkly erratic. The positive vibe stems from Cudi's desire to always change and reinvent: [...] "I always <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> myself {{to the next level}} with everything I do. Since I've been in the business, critics have known that about me. When I started working on Indicud, I just wanted to bring more energy into my sound. Most of my old music was driven towards relaxed, chilled out smoke music. And that was my goal first coming in. Now it's like, 'What’s a side of me that people haven’t seen?' The only time people have seen me on up-tempos is on remixes or some shit. So I just wanted to take the energy to the next level. That ultimately inspired the subject matter. It was a chain reaction. With the up-tempos came more positive lyrics. It just brightened up the whole shit." ...|$|E
500|$|Blackburn {{directed}} the 2008 film Donkey Punch, which he co-wrote with David Bloom. His total {{budget for the}} film was £1 million. Blackburn's production team went through a casting process which took seven months; the film stars Nichola Burley, Tom Burke, Jaime Winstone and Julian Morris. He shot the film in South Africa, over 24 days. Film shooting for Donkey Punch began in March 2007; during production Blackburn dealt with actors afflicted by hypothermia and tidal surges on location. In an interview with Total Film, Blackburn commented, [...] "I think Donkey Punch is an extreme thriller or an extreme reality-based thriller. The {{whole point of the}} film is it's grounded in reality." [...] Blackburn wrote that he made [...] Donkey Punch, [...] "to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> the genre." [...] Donkey Punch received mixed reviews; the film obtained a rating of 50% based on 51 reviews at Rotten Tomatoes, and a score of 43 out of 100 at Metacritic. The Philadelphia Inquirer compared Blackburn's work to films including filmmaker Peter Berg's Very Bad Things and director Philip Noyce's Dead Calm, and wrote, [...] "Donkey Punch offers a gripping mix of sexual heat and nasty menace." [...] The Los Angeles Times additionally compared Blackburn's work to Dead Calm as well as director Roman Polanski's Knife in the Water, and concluded, Donkey Punch isn't without a certain power as it gleefully turns its careless hedonists into caged, paranoid rats." [...] The film was Blackburn's first work to be shown at the Sundance Film Festival, where it received a positive reception from the audience in attendance.|$|E

The tensions and fighting that resulted led Lenardo, Cavanaugh, and Walker all to leave first.

2500|$|This gap {{is called}} the tunnel. With {{the ball in the}} tunnel the two hookers (and {{sometimes}} the props) compete for possession by trying to hook the ball backwards with their feet, while the entire pack tries to push the opposing pack backwards. The side that wins possession usually transfers the ball {{to the back of the}} scrum [...] which is done with their feet. Once at the back it is picked up either by the number 8, or by the scrum-half. From here the ball is in play and the player with possession will either run, pass or kick the ball. On other occasions the forwards will hold the ball in the scrum and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> the opposition backwards.|$|E
2500|$|On June 8, 2014, Jerad and Amanda Miller {{killed two}} Las Vegas police {{officers}} and a civilian before Amanda Miller took her life. Jerad Miller was fatally wounded and died during a shootout with police.

Their original plan may have been to take over a courthouse and execute public officials. The Millers had moved from Indiana to the Las Vegas area in January. They were quoted on Reno television KRNV: [...] "I feel sorry for any federal agents that want to come here and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> around or anything like that. I really don't want violence toward them but if they're gonna come and bring violence to us, well, if that's the language they want to speak, we'll learn it."

2500|$|Much of the {{coverage}} of the debate has involved how the different sides are competing to express their views, rather than the specific reform proposals. The health care reform debate in the United States has been influenced by the Tea Party protest phenomenon, with reporters and politicians spending time reacting to it. Supporters of a greater government role in healthcare, such as former insurance PR executive Wendell Potter of the Center for Media and Democracy- whose funding comes from groups such as the Tides Foundation- argue that the hyperbole generated by this phenomenon is a form of corporate astroturfing, which he says that he used to write for CIGNA. Opponents of more government involvement, such as Phil Kerpen of Americans for Prosperity- whose funding comes mainly from the Koch Industries corporation- counter-argue that those corporations oppose a public-plan, but some <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> for government actions that will unfairly benefit them, such as forcing private companies to buy health insurance for their employees. Journalist Ben Smith has referred to mid-2009 as [...] "The Summer of Astroturf" [...] given the organizing and co-ordinating efforts made by various groups on both pro- and anti-reform sides.|$|E

2500|$|Ms. Kelly {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of hundred to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of seventy, based on ten reviews. Alex Macpherson of The Guardian [...] gave the album {{four and a}} half stars out of five. He complimented Ms. Kelly as [...] "poised, dignified and completely lacking in the hysteria normally associated with R divas giving vent to their feelings" [...] but felt that [...] "the emotions simmering beneath her glassy, controlled tones are as raw as any Mary J. Blige classic." [...] Ben Williams of the New York Post referred the album as a [...] "mostly upbeat record that soulfully delves into contemporary funk", while Entertainment Weekly found that [...] "after a blah solo debut with 2002's Simply Deep, Kelly Rowland — assisted by producers like Scott Storch and Polow Da Don — brings the noise and the funk to her vibrant follow-up. Newsday writer Glenn Gamboa remarked that with Ms. Kelly, Rowland [...] "doesn't dabble in various genres. She doesn't <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> the envelope. Rowland does what she does best: She cranks out one potential pop hit after another. Ms. Kelly shows that Rowland knows her strengths and that she intends to keep playing to them." ...|$|E

The Waffle supported the nationalization of Canadian industries {{to take them out}} of the hands of American interests. [...] The group was endorsed by the New Democratic Youth. The Waffle manifesto stated that [...] "A socialist society must be one in which there is democratic control of all institutions, which have a major effect on men's lives and where there is equal opportunity for creative non-exploitative self-development. It is now time to go beyond the welfare state." [...] and that [...] "The New Democratic Party must provide leadership in the struggle to extend working men's influence into every area of industrial decision-making.... By bringing men together primarily as buyers and sellers of each other, by enshrining profitability and material gain in place of humanity and spiritual growth, capitalism has always been inherently alienating. Today, sheer size combined with modern technology further exaggerates man's sense of [...] insignificance and impotence. A socialist transformation of society will return to man his sense of humanity, to replace his sense of being a commodity. But a socialist democracy implies man's control of his immediate environment as well, and in any strategy for building socialism, community democracy is as vital as the struggle for electoral success." ...|$|E
