History of Fiji's employment and industrial relations illustrates that the labour market of Fiji is characterised with dynamism and uncertainty. In particular, this dynamism and uncertainty was {{mainly caused by}} the existing employment laws such as Employment Act (Cap. 92), Trade Disputes Act (Cap. 97), Wages Councils Act (Cap. 98), <b>Trade</b> <b>Unions</b> Act (Cap. 96), <b>Trade</b> <b>Unions</b> (<b>Recognition)</b> Act 1998 and Public Holidays Act (Cap. 101). These industrial relations acts were labeled as archaic and were not suitable to the changing context of Fiji. As a result, Employment Relations Promulgation (2007) was formulated and enforced in the country primarily to stabilise the labour market of Fiji.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} ability of <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> to achieve <b>recognition</b> for bargaining purposes {{is affected by the}} internationalisation of the firm’s product market. We use UK private sector establishment-level data for the period 1984 - 98 from the Workplace Industrial Relations Survey (WIRS) series. The findings suggest that firms operating in international markets are significantly less likely to recognise <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> for bargaining purposes compared to those who do not.

40|$|A key {{objective}} of British unions {{is to develop}} their representative role so as to establish their relevance to the workforce and thereby reverse the overall decline in <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> membership. To many, the legislative reforms undertaken by New Labour since 1999 offer some hope {{that this can be}} achieved. These reforms seem to provide a pyramid of representation, whereby <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> can establish their relevance when they 'accompany' individual employees in grievance and disciplinary proceedings, and when they act as recipients of information and consultation. By attracting members in this fashion, there would seem to be the promise that unions can reascend to the position of recognized and effective parties in collective bargaining. However, this paper suggests that a barrier to the achievement of this objective is the particular conception of 'partnership' adopted by New Labour, which deviates from that of the TUC. This partnership' is essentially individualistic in character, procedural inform, and unitary in specification. These characteristics are reflected in the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions and are therefore likely to inhibit the progression of a <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> to <b>recognition</b> in collective bargaining...|$|R

This project explored the nature and functions {{of a range of}} informal networks developed by freelance workers to represent and defend their interests in the UK audio-visual (AV) industries. The structure of employment in this sector has changed considerably over the past two decades. Worker insecurity and uncertainty have developed as permanent jobs are replaced by freelance and short-term contracts. Over this period <b>Trade</b> <b>Union</b> influence and <b>recognition</b> has been eroded while the importance of networks based on informal contacts and reputation has increased. This project explores the ways in which freelance workers use networks to articulate and advance both individual and collective interests. The researchers interviewed 35 freelance workers, who were questioned on their individual behaviour, attitudes, and aspirations in relation to informal networks. They also conducted 7 interviews with key informants from <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> and interest groups exploring the interaction between informal networks and traditional institutions of industrial relations. The principal objectives of the study were: to explore the use of informal networks by freelance workers in AV industries to examine how such networks are used to represent/defend worker interests in the employment relationship to assess whether such networks provide the potential for collective renewal and/or a foundation for alternative institutions to represent collective interests to investigate the impact of such networks on existing formal networks of representation (i. e. <b>Trade</b> <b>Unions).</b> Further information about the study is available from its ESRC award page.

Nevertheless, when the election came in January 1906, Lansbury's socialist brew proved too much for what his biographer John Shepherd describes as [...] "the mainly working-class, all-male electorate", and Lansbury was heavily defeated.
