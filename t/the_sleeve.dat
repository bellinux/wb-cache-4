5|$|Early {{pressings}} of <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> {{were presented}} in a six-panel gatefold cover, with one side displaying the landscape in the daytime, whilst the other shows the same image at night, playing {{with the idea that}} during the day, the countryside is glorious and the city is dull and grey, whereas at nighttime the countryside is dark and the city is illuminated and alive. To prioritize the design, no text was included on <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> apart from a promotional sticker shaped like a red balloon featuring the band's name and album title. Later copies of the album came in a standard plastic case with a protective cardboard sleeve.|$|E

The mechanical property degradations of <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> {{before and after}} radiations were present. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were {{used to analyze the}} element contents, the morphologies and the molecular structures of the samples to study the damage mechanism of <b>the</b> <b>sleeves.</b> A degradation model for the changes of the mechanical properties of <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> in electron radiation environment was proposed. It is shown that the increase of irradiation degradation of the polyethylene causes the sleeves' mechanical properties. For the penetration depth of different energy electrons in polyethylene is different, only a shallow layer <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> is affected by 45 keV energy electrons, while 1 MeV and 2 MeV energy electrons are penetrated <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> and cause <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> great damage. <b>The</b> mechanical properties of <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> are decreased by about 30 % to 40 % after 45 keV energy electron irradiation, and decreased by about 100 % after 1 MeV and 2 MeV energy electron irradiation...|$|R

5|$|Live Undead {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a short association between Slayer and artist Albert Cueller. Cueller would design <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> image, which depicts the four band members as grinning, partially decayed zombies walking through a graveyard.|$|E
5|$|Sweetheart of the Rodeo went on {{to inspire}} {{the name of the}} 1980s country duo, Sweethearts of the Rodeo, who paid tribute to the Byrds' album with <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> of their 1990 album, Buffalo Zone.|$|E
5|$|The album art {{was seen}} by many within the {{industry}} as coarse and lacking accepted layout or typographical qualities. HMV would only shelve <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> back to front on their racking shelves.|$|E
25|$|The unfitted looser {{fit of the}} 1640s {{continued}} into the 1650s. In <b>the</b> 1650s, <b>sleeves</b> ranged from above to below <b>the</b> elbow. <b>The</b> <b>sleeves</b> could be slashed, unslashed, or dividing into two parts and buttoned together. The length of the coat reached the waist but by the late 1650s and early 1660s, the coat became very short, only reaching {{the bottom of the}} rib cage, much like a bolero jacket. During <b>the</b> 1660s, <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> varied a lot from elbow length to no <b>sleeves</b> at all. <b>The</b> coat could be worn opened or buttoned in the front. One common factor were many yards of ribbon loops arranged on the shoulders and the lower parts of <b>the</b> <b>sleeves.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{wellbore}} for <b>the</b> sliding <b>sleeve</b> {{technique is}} different in that <b>the</b> sliding <b>sleeves</b> are included at set spacings in the steel casing {{at the time it}} is set in place. <b>The</b> sliding <b>sleeves</b> are usually all closed at this time. When the well is due to be fractured, <b>the</b> bottom sliding <b>sleeve</b> is opened using one of several activation techniques and the first stage gets pumped. Once finished, <b>the</b> next <b>sleeve</b> is opened, concurrently isolating the previous stage, and the process repeats. For <b>the</b> sliding <b>sleeve</b> method, wireline is usually not required.|$|R
5|$|A new remastered and {{expanded}} version of Live And Dangerous {{was released in}} 2011. As well as the full album, remastered by Andy Pearce and Matt Wortham, it featured two additional tracks that were not used, and a DVD with the Rainbow Theatre footage. <b>The</b> <b>sleeve</b> notes were written by Malcolm Dome and included a debate of exactly {{how much of the}} album was live, and what was overdubbed.|$|E
5|$|A {{painting}} of the band by John Byrne was at an earlier point under consideration {{to be used as}} the album's cover. The piece was later used for <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> of the compilation album The Beatles' Ballads, released in 1980. In 2012 the original artwork was put up for auction.|$|E
5|$|As is {{the norm}} with all Lemon Jelly-based {{releases}} and promotional material, the artwork for Lost Horizons was created by bandmember Fred Deakin and his London-based graphic design company Airside. <b>The</b> <b>sleeve</b> features a three-dimensional model landscape of a city and countryside built by Airside member Sam Burford, which Deakin then visualised into a computer-generated image using Maya.|$|E

50|$|SleevesSleeves were tightly fit {{during the}} early Victorian era. It matched with the tight fit women’s small waist in the design, and <b>the</b> {{shoulder}} <b>sleeve</b> seamline was drooped more to show a tighter fit on the arm. This eventually limited women’s movements with <b>the</b> <b>sleeves.</b> However, as crinolines started to develop in fashion, sleeves turned to be like large bells which gave the dress a heavier volume. Engageantes, which were usually made of lace, linen, or lawn, with cambric and broderie anglaise, were worn under <b>the</b> <b>sleeves.</b> They were easy to remove, launder and restitch into position, so to act as false sleeves, which was tacked to <b>the</b> elbow-length <b>sleeves</b> during <b>the</b> time. They commonly appear under <b>the</b> bell-shaped <b>sleeves</b> of day dresses.|$|R

5|$|During the 2011 Rugby World Cup the All Blacks had an {{embroidered}} William Webb Ellis cup on <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> {{of their}} jerseys with the year '1987' underneath. This was to signify which year {{the team had}} won the tournament. Each of the four teams who had won the competition had the same detailing on their jerseys.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{release was}} titled Live in Japan and {{featured}} a unique sleeve design, with an overhead stage {{shot of the}} band, a selection of photographs from a gig at the Rainbow Theatre in London, and an insert with lyrics and a hand-written message from each band member. The first pressing came with a 35mm film negative with photos of the band which buyers could develop into their own prints. <b>The</b> <b>sleeve</b> notes claimed that the recording only contained the Tokyo gig, though {{in fact it was}} musically identical to the version released {{in the rest of the}} world. Phil Collen, later to play in Def Leppard, was in the audience for the Rainbow gig as captured on <b>the</b> <b>sleeve.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the Artillery uniforms were a variety of {{handmade}} and personally customized uniforms. By 1862, the Confederate uniforms became organized. They became cadet gray and were to be lined {{with a layer of}} red around <b>the</b> <b>sleeve.</b> The pant legs were light blue. Even after the uniforms were organized many of the artillerymen wore regular clothes due to the heat and discomfort caused by the regular uniforms.|$|E
50|$|Due to Probyn's scrummaging {{techniques}} {{some players}} took to cutting off <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> of their shirts as they believed {{this was how}} Jeff managed to get so low down in the scrum and would use <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> as leverage. After Probyn continued to keep the scrum incredibly low, {{it was evident that}} their sleeve cutting was unnecessary.|$|R

5|$|Led Zeppelin's next album, Houses of the Holy, was {{released}} in March 1973. It featured further experimentation by the band, who expanded their use of synthesisers and mellotron orchestration. The predominantly orange album cover, designed by the London-based design group Hipgnosis, depicts images of nude children climbing the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. Although the children are not shown from the front, the cover was controversial {{at the time of}} the album's release. As with the band's fourth album, neither their name nor the album title was printed on <b>the</b> <b>sleeve.</b>|$|E
5|$|The credits {{printed on}} <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> {{of the first}} release were largely {{incomplete}} and made no distinction between the recording sessions of 1982-84 and those of 1987-88, apparently validating the false assumption that the original line-up of Blue Öyster Cult had reunited for {{the making of the}} album. Aside from the list of band members, the credits reported only some session musicians {{and other members of the}} so-called Guitar Orchestra of the State of Imaginos, and omitted other personnel who had contributed to Imaginos.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} LP {{cover was}} designed as a spoof of a 12x16-inch (305x406mm) 12-page small-town English newspaper, entitled The St. Cleve Chronicle and Linwell Advertiser, with articles, competitions and advertisements lampooning the typical parochial and amateurish journalism of the local English press. The band's record company, Chrysalis Records, complained that <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> would be too expensive to produce, but Anderson countered that if a real newspaper could be produced, a parody of one would also be practical.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sleeve</b> {{front cover}} used a {{black-and-white}} still from The Man Who Fell to Earth, in which Bowie, as the character Thomas Jerome Newton, {{steps into the}} space capsule that will return him to his home planet. Bowie had insisted on the cropped black-and-white image as he felt that in the original coloured full-size image the sky looked artificial; when Rykodisc reissued Bowie's catalogue in the early 1990s the colour version was used. The back cover showed Bowie sketching the Kabbalah Sephirot with chalk—something {{he had been doing}} on the set of the film.|$|E
5|$|The crest was {{modified}} in 1995 after consultation with a Supporters Forum, with the turrets of the Wolsey Gate {{moved to the}} top of the crest, the yellow background changed to red, the Suffolk Punch given a more dominant physique and the F.C. expanded to Football Club. Three stars were added to <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> of the team's away shirt for the 2004–05 season, and also to the home kit for the 2005–06 season. These stars were added to represent the three major trophies which Ipswich Town have won; the FA Cup, the UEFA Cup and the old Division One. The stars were relocated directly above the crest when the shirt was redesigned prior to the 2007–08 season.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the Cavalry uniforms {{were made by the}} cavalrymen themselves. By 1862, the Confederate {{regulations}} ordered the uniform to become organized, being cadet gray and lined with a thin layer around <b>the</b> <b>sleeve.</b> The pant legs were light blue with a yellow strip rising {{from the bottom of the}} leg to the top. Non-commissioned officers of the cavalry wore either regular clothes from home or a variety of different types of uniforms. yellow was the prescribed branch of service color, but surviving uniforms show beyond a doubt that the vast majority of cavalrymen who used any branch of service color, used buff as yellow cloth was virtually non existent in the Confederacy.|$|E
