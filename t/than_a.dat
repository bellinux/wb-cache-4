50|$|Commonly {{known as}} a CT Scan or CAT scan, this form of imaging {{is very similar to}} x-ray {{technology}} but produces many more images <b>than</b> <b>an</b> x-ray does. The multiple images produce cross-sectional views not possible with an x-ray. This allows a physician or radiologist to examine the images from many more angles <b>than</b> <b>an</b> x-ray allows. For this reason the CT scan is much more accurate in detecting spondylolysis <b>than</b> <b>an</b> x-ray. Bone scintigraphy combined with CT scan is considered the gold standard which means that it is best at detecting spondylolysis.|$|R
