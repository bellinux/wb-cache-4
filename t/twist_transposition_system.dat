40|$|The histone-like {{nucleoid}} structuring protein (H-NS) is {{an important}} regulator of stress response and virulence genes in gram-negative bacteria. In addition to binding regulatory regions of genes in a structure-specific manner, H-NS also binds in a structure-specific manner to sites in the Tn 10 transpososome, allowing it {{to act as a}} positive regulator of Tn 10 transposition. This is the only example to date of H-NS regulating a <b>transposition</b> <b>system</b> by interacting directly with the transposition machinery. In general, transposition complexes tend to include segments of deformed DNA and given the capacity of H-NS to bind such structures, and the results from the Tn 10 system, we asked if H-NS might regulate another <b>transposition</b> <b>system</b> (Tn 5) by directly binding the transposition machinery. We show in the current work that H-NS does bind Tn 5 transposition complexes and use hydroxyl radical footprinting to characterize the H-NS interaction with the Tn 5 transpososome. We also show that H-NS can promote Tn 5 transpososome formation in vitro, which correlates with the Tn 5 system showing a dependence on H-NS for transposition in vivo. Taken together the results suggest that H-NS might {{play an important role in}} the regulation of many different bacterial <b>transposition</b> <b>systems</b> and thereby contribute directly to lateral gene transfer...|$|R

However, an in vivo <b>transposition</b> <b>system</b> using Tol 2 has not yet been developed. Here we report the in vivo Tol 2 <b>transposition</b> <b>system</b> in a model vertebrate, zebrafish. First, we constructed transgenic zebrafish that carried single-copy integrations of Tol 2 on the genome and injected transposase mRNA into one-cell stage embryos. The Tol 2 insertions were mobilized efficiently in the germ lineage. We then mobilized an insertion of the Tol 2 gene trap construct in the nup 214 gene, which caused a recessive lethal mutant phenotype, and demonstrated that this method is applicable to the isolation of revertants from a transposon insertional mutant. Second, we constructed transgenic fish carrying the transposase cDNA {{under the control of the}} hsp 70 promoter. Double-transgenic fish containing the transposase gene and a single-copy Tol 2 insertion were treated with heat shock at the adult stage. We found that transposition can be induced efficiently in the male germ cells. We analyzed new integration sites and found that the majority (83 %) of them were mapped on chromosomes other than the transposon donor chromosomes and that 9 % of local hopping events mapped less than 300 kb away from the donor loci.

40|$|The {{frequency}} of DNA <b>transposition</b> in <b>transposition</b> <b>systems</b> that employ a strand transfer step may be significantly {{affected by the}} occurrence of a disintegration reaction, a reaction that reverses the strand transfer event. We have asked whether disintegration occurs in the Tn 10 <b>transposition</b> <b>system.</b> We show that disintegration substrates (substrates constituting {{one half of the}} strand transfer product) are assembled into a transpososome that mimics the strand transfer intermediate. This strand transfer transpososome (STT) does appear to support an intermolecular disintegration reaction, but only at a very low level. Strikingly, assembly of the STT is not dependent on IHF, a host protein that is required for de novo assembly of all previously characterized Tn 10 transpososomes. We suggest that disintegration substrates are able to form both transposon end and target type contacts with transposase because of their enhanced conformational flexibility. This probably allows the conformation of DNA within the complex that prevents the destructive disintegration reaction, and is responsible for relaxing the DNA sequence requirements for STT formation relative to other Tn 10 transpososomes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Completed genome {{projects}} have revealed an astonishing diversity of transposable genetic elements, implying {{the existence of}} novel element families yet to be discovered from diverse life forms. Concurrently, several better understood transposon systems have been exploited as efficient tools in molecular biology and genomics applications. Characterization of new mobile elements and improvement of the existing transposition technology platforms warrant easy-to-use assays for the quantitative analysis of DNA transposition. Results Here we developed a universal in vivo platform {{for the analysis of}} transposition frequency with class II mobile elements, i. e., DNA transposons. For each particular transposon system, cloning of the transposon ends and the cognate transposase gene, in three consecutive steps, generates a multifunctional plasmid, which drives inducible expression of the transposase gene and includes a mobilisable lacZ -containing reporter transposon. The assay scores transposition events as blue microcolonies, papillae, growing within otherwise whitish Escherichia coli colonies on indicator plates. We developed the assay using phage Mu transposition as a test model and validated the platform using various MuA transposase mutants. For further validation and to illustrate universality, we introduced IS 903 <b>transposition</b> <b>system</b> components into the assay. The developed assay is adjustable to a desired level of initial transposition via the control of a plasmid-borne E. coli arabinose promoter. In practice, the transposition frequency is modulated by varying the concentration of arabinose or glucose in the growth medium. We show that variable levels of transpositional activity can be analysed, thus enabling straightforward screens for hyper- or hypoactive transposase mutants, regardless of the original wild-type activity level. Conclusions The established universal papillation assay platform should be widely applicable to a variety of mobile elements. It can be used for mechanistic studies to dissect transposition and provides a means to screen or scrutinise transposase mutants and genes encoding host factors. In succession, improved versions of <b>transposition</b> <b>systems</b> should yield better tools for molecular biology and offer versatile genome modification vehicles for many types of studies, including gene therapy and stem cell research. </p...|$|R

High-frequency random insertion (of about 1 %) obtained with this system in Lactococcus lactis allows efficient mutagenesis, with typically one insertion per cell. After ISS 1 replicative transposition, the chromosome contains duplicated ISS 1 sequences flanking pG+ host. This structure allows cloning of the interrupted gene.
