5|$|The {{availability}} of new cheap land {{led to a}} rapid increase in {{the population of the}} territory, with thousands of new settlers entering the region every year. Large settlements began <b>to</b> <b>spring</b> up {{on the periphery of the}} territory around the Great Lakes, the Ohio River, the Wabash River, and the Mississippi River. Much of the interior, though, remained inhabited by the Native American tribes and was left unsettled.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} saprobic, and is found growing in {{groups on the}} ground or on moss-covered {{decaying}} wood, especially amongst fallen pine needles. In North America, fruit bodies appear in the spring and summer, and are fairly common; in Britain, the fungus fruits from winter <b>to</b> <b>spring,</b> and is rare. Its small size and dark color makes it easy to overlook.|$|E
5|$|To {{prepare for}} the 1928 season, Berg went up to a lumber camp in New York's Adirondack Mountains three weeks before {{reporting}} to the White Sox spring training facility in Shreveport, Louisiana. The hard labor did wonders for him, as he reported <b>to</b> <b>spring</b> training on March 2, 1928 in excellent shape. By {{the end of the}} season, Berg had established himself as the starting catcher.|$|E

5|$|Berg {{returned}} to Columbia {{after the season}} to continue working on his law degree. Despite White Sox owner Charles Comiskey offering him more money to come <b>to</b> <b>spring</b> training, Berg declined, and informed the White Sox {{that he would be}} reporting late for the 1927 season. Noel Dowling, a professor to whom Berg explained his situation, told Berg to take extra classes in the fall, and said that he would arrange with the dean a leave of absence from law school the following year, 1928.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} {{exploding}} cigars were being turned out by manufacturers such as Adams and Appel, the chemical explosive variety {{had fallen out}} of favor. According to Adams, the large-scale switch to a non-chemical device occurred in approximately 1915 {{in the aftermath of a}} death caused by a homemade exploding cigar rigged with dynamite. Though exploding cigars were not normally rigged with dynamite but with explosive caps using a less powerful incendiary, following the incident, a number of U.S. states banned the product altogether. The replacement for chemical explosives was a metal spring mechanism, bound with cord—as the victim puffed away, the cord burned through, causing the device <b>to</b> <b>spring</b> open, thus rupturing the cigar's end.|$|E
5|$|Evan Lysacek {{was born}} in Chicago, Illinois, and raised in Naperville, Illinois. His mother, Tanya (née Santoro), is a {{substitute}} teacher in Naperville, and his father, Don, is a building contractor.

5|$|French cuisine varies {{according}} to the season. In summer, salads and fruit dishes are popular because they are refreshing and produce is inexpensive and abundant. Greengrocers prefer to sell their fruit and vegetables at lower prices if needed, rather than see them rot in the heat. At the end of summer, mushrooms become plentiful and appear in stews throughout France. The hunting season begins in September and runs through February. Game of all kinds is eaten, often in elaborate dishes that celebrate {{the success of the}} hunt. Shellfish are at their peak when winter turns <b>to</b> <b>spring,</b> and oysters appear in restaurants in large quantities.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} Washington {{preferred}} to fight major battles or to utilize a Fabian strategy to harass the British with quick, sharp attacks {{followed by a}} retreat so that the larger British army could not catch him. His southern commander Greene did use Fabian tactics in 1780–81; Washington did so only in fall 1776 <b>to</b> <b>spring</b> 1777, after losing New York City and seeing much of his army melt away. Trenton and Princeton were Fabian examples. By summer 1777 Washington had rebuilt his strength and his confidence; he stopped using raids and went for large-scale confrontations, as at Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, and Yorktown.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Holloman again {{spent the}} season with the Volunteers, posting a record of 17–10 with a 4.46 ERA. After the season ended, the Chicago Cubs signed him and gave him an {{invitation}} <b>to</b> <b>spring</b> training. Holloman's outgoing nature clashed with manager Frankie Frisch, who did not appreciate the pitcher's attitude. It was, partially, {{for this reason that}} Holloman did not make the major league roster. Holloman split the 1950 season between Nashville and the Shreveport Sports of the Texas League. Combined, he had 13 wins and 13 losses on the year. In 1951, he spent seven games with Nashville, but spent most of {{the season with}} the Augusta Tigers of the Sally League, where he posted an 11–9 record and a 3.87 ERA.|$|E
