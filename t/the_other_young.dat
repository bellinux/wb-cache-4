5|$|May 9 {{was one of}} {{two times}} Young came within an inning of a shutout by {{pitching}} eight scoreless innings; August 17 against the Cleveland Indians was <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> <b>Young</b> recorded a personal-best eight strikeouts in a seven-inning no-decision on June 2 at Detroit. The closest Young came to a no-hitter was 5⅔ innings of hitless pitching in a road game against the Houston Astros on June 25 before allowing a Craig Biggio single in the sixth inning. Over the course of the season, Young was the beneficiary of the second-highest run support in the majors, trailing only David Wells of the Boston Red Sox. However, he surrendered three runs or less in 22 of 31 starts. After a 2005 season when he went 5–0 with a 3.47 ERA in 11 games during the day and 7–7 with a 4.71 ERA in 20 games at night, he had a career 8–1 record with a 3.31 ERA in 15 day games and 7–8 with a 5.05 mark in 23 games at night.|$|E
5|$|Taylor's exhortations to the Vietnamese {{officers}} to remove Khánh {{were not a}} secret, and it had an unwanted side-effect; it accelerated coup action from figures not favored by Washington. The likes of Kỳ, Thiệu, Có and Cang were {{not yet ready to}} stage a coup, and their preparations were well behind those of Thảo, an unstinting plotter. On February 14, the commander of the Marine Brigade General Lê Nguyên Khang reported to an American official that he was involved in plotting against Khánh but said he and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>Young</b> Turks were not ready because the military was not sufficiently united. He said they had to wait for a time when a coup could be carried out without generating unspecified side-effects. Khang was aware Thảo was planning a move with some generals who were now on the outer. He anticipated trouble in trying to keep his subordinates from joining Thảo, as his men might not wait for the younger generals to launch their coup if they thought it would never come.|$|E

25|$|Dick {{was on his}} National Service when {{spotted by}} Fenton and brought into the team. Meanwhile, Allison played for local rivals Charlton Athletic but had made only two league {{appearances}} and was nearing 24 years old. Fenton acquired Allison by selling {{off one of the}} young players coming through the system. The pair went on to feature for the club for the remainder of Fenton's tenure with the team, though Allison had to retire through illness and instead became mentor to Bobby Moore alongside Irish international full back Noel Cantwell and all <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>young</b> players on the squad. Moore had been scouted initially in 1955 after Fenton had reportedly been tipped to his presence in the East Ham side, but it took two bites of the cherry for Jack Turner (then West Ham scout) to encourage his signing. In the end Fenton, put the lad on the books at £7 a month.|$|E

500|$|According to critic Vladimir Stasov, Glazunov and Tchaikovsky {{first met}} in October 1884 at a {{gathering}} hosted by Balakirev. Glazunov was then 19 years old. Tchaikovsky was in Saint Petersburg because his opera Eugene Onegin was being {{performed at the}} Mariinsky Theater. Glazunov later wrote that while the nationalists' circle [...] "was no longer so ideologically closed and isolated {{as it had been}} earlier", they [...] "did not consider P.I. Tchaikovsky one of our own. We valued only a few of his works, like Romeo and Juliet, The Tempest, Francesca [...] and the finale of the Second Symphony. The rest of his output was either unknown or alien to us". Tchaikovsky's presence won over Glazunov and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>young</b> members present, and his conversation with them [...] "was a fresh breeze amid our somewhat dusty atmosphere... Many of the young musicians present, including Lyadov and myself, left Balakirev's apartment charmed by Tchaikovsky's personality.... As Lyadov put it, our acquaintance with the great composer was a real occasion." ...|$|E
500|$|Azazel's last {{appearance}} chronologically {{is in the}} second season finale [...] "All Hell Breaks Loose", where he kidnaps Sam and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>young</b> adults that he had infected. He visits Sam in a dream, and reveals that his [...] "special children" [...] must {{fight to the death}} to determine who will lead his army. Although Sam is the demon's favorite, the super-strong Jake Talley becomes the winner. As Dean sells his soul to another demon in exchange for Sam's resurrection, Azazel gives Jake the Colt and coerces him to travel to a cemetery {{in the middle of a}} giant devil's trap. Though Sam and Dean, along with other hunters, attempt to stop him, Jake uses the Colt as a key to unlock a mausoleum there. This action briefly opens a gateway to Hell, releasing Lilith and hundreds of other demons. With the devil's trap around the cemetery now broken, Azazel confronts the Winchesters and easily overpowers them. However, John's soul escapes through the Gate, and distracts Azazel long enough for Dean to shoot him dead with the Colt.|$|E
500|$|Gestation in {{elephants}} typically lasts {{around two}} years with interbirth intervals usually lasting four to five years. Births tend to take place during the wet season. Calves are born [...] tall and weigh around [...] Typically, only a single young is born, but twins sometimes occur. The relatively long pregnancy is maintained by five corpus luteums (as opposed to one in most mammals) and gives the foetus more time to develop, particularly the brain and trunk. As such, newborn elephants are precocial and quickly stand and walk to follow their mother and family herd. A new calf is usually the centre of attention for herd members. Adults and most of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>young</b> will gather around the newborn, touching and caressing it with their trunks. For the first few days, the mother is intolerant of other herd members near her young. Alloparenting – where a calf is cared for by someone other than its mother – takes place in some family groups. Allomothers are typically two to twelve years old. When a predator is near, the family group gathers together with the calves in the centre.|$|E

500|$|Sir Timothy Shelley {{gave his}} {{grandson}} Percy Florence {{an increase in}} his allowance for his twenty-first birthday, allowing Mary Shelley and Percy Florence to plan a second, longer trip to the Continent. In June 1842, Mary Shelley and her son left for a fourteen-month tour. They were accompanied by {{a few of his}} friends: Alexander Andrew Knox, a poet and classicist, whom Emily Sunstein, a biographer of Mary Shelley, describes as [...] "reminiscent of [...] Shelley"; Henry Hugh Pearson, a musician who had written musical accompaniments for several of Percy Shelley's poems; and Robert Leslie Ellis. Mary Shelley hoped that the easy manners of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>young</b> men would rub off on her awkward son, but instead they became petty and jealous of each other. The group visited Liège, Cologne, Coblenz, Mainz, Frankfurt, Kissingen, Berlin, Dresden, Prague, Salzburg, the Tyrol, Innsbruck, Riva, Verona, Venice, Florence, and Rome. In Rome, Mary Shelley toured museums with the French art critic Alex Rio; Percy Florence was unimpressed with the culture and refused to see the art, infuriating his mother, who spent an increasing amount of her time seeing the country with Knox instead. She also paid numerous visits to Percy Bysshe Shelley's grave in Rome. After two months in the Sorrento Peninsula, the group was short of money; Percy Florence and his friends returned home while Mary Shelley went on to Paris.|$|E
