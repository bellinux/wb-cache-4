5|$|One {{account of}} the executions states {{that some of the}} {{condemned}} were still alive when their bodies were burned, and that the executioners borrowed a walking stick from an onlooker with which <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>their</b> victims' moving limbs back into the fire; its owner refused to take it back after it had been in contact with witches.|$|E
5|$|The Twittys {{and their}} {{supporters}} criticized a perceived lack of progress by Aruban police. The Twittys' own actions in Aruba were also criticized, and the Twittys were accused of actively stifling any evidence that might impugn Holloway's character by asking her fellow students to remain silent about the case and using their access to the media <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>their</b> own version of events. The Twittys denied this.|$|E

5|$|After this, {{the units}} of I Anzac Corps {{returned}} to the Somme, to relieve units of the Fourth Army, which had managed <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>their</b> lines to a position just below the Bapaume heights throughout September. The 2nd Battalion {{was not involved in}} any major actions during this time, although elements from the 1st Brigade—specifically the 1st Battalion with support from the 3rd—put in an attack on a salient that had developed in the front line north of Gueudecourt, which failed amid exceptionally muddy conditions.|$|E
5|$|Corder {{was taken}} back to Suffolk where he was tried at Shire Hall, Bury St Edmunds. The trial started on 7 August 1828, having been put back several days because of the {{interest}} which the case had generated. The hotels in Bury St Edmunds began to fill up from as early as 21 July, and admittance to the court was by ticket {{only because of the}} large numbers who wanted to view the trial. Despite this, the judge and court officials still had <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>their</b> way bodily through the crowds that had gathered around the door.|$|E
5|$|Having {{just nine}} turns, the fewest on the Formula One calendar, the circuit offers very few {{low-speed}} sections and gave teams an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>their</b> power units to their potential.

5|$|Like many ink caps, {{it grows}} in tufts. It is {{commonly}} associated with buried wood and is found in grassland, meadows, disturbed ground, and open terrain from late spring to autumn. Fruiting bodies have been known <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>their</b> way up through asphalt and even tennis courts. It is also common in urban areas and appears in vacant lots, and tufts of fungi can be quite large and fruit several times a year. If dug up, the mycelium can often be found originating on buried dead wood.|$|E
5|$|On Rubicun III, the Edo {{explain to}} Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) and Worf that capital {{punishment}} {{is used to}} enforce their laws. The away team rush to warn Wesley, only to discover he has accidentally broken a greenhouse while playing catch with the Edo youths. An Edo policeman attempts to give Wesley a lethal injection for this infraction of the law, but Yar and Worf draw their phasers. On the ship, the sphere leaves Data's body and departs. Picard, upon hearing of the situation with Wesley, transports to the surface. He meets {{with representatives of the}} Edo in a council chamber and explains that Earth no longer practices capital punishment. Some Edo interpret this stance as an attempt by the Federation <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>their</b> superiority and suggest that Picard should mount a rescue effort for the boy. He says he cannot, quoting the Prime Directive.|$|E
5|$|The Australians on 400 Plateau had {{for some}} time been {{subjected}} to sniping and artillery fire and could see Turkish troops digging in on Gun Ridge. Around 13:00 a column of Turkish reinforcements from the 27th Infantry Regiment, in at least battalion strength, were observed moving along the ridge-line from the south. The Turks then turned towards 400 Plateau and advanced in extended order. The Turkish counter-attack soon forced the advanced Australian troops to withdraw, and their machine-gun fire caused them heavy casualties. It {{was not long before}} the attack had forced a wedge between the Australians on Baby 700 and those on 400 Plateau. The heavy Turkish fire onto Lone Pine forced the survivors to withdraw back to the western slope of 400 Plateau. At 14:25 Turkish artillery and small arms fire was so heavy that the Indian artillerymen were forced <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>their</b> guns back off the plateau by hand, and they reformed on the beach.|$|E

5|$|The {{station at}} Chalfont Road was built with almost all {{facilities}} {{on the up}} side (the London-bound platform). As Chalfont St Giles, the largest nearby settlement, {{was on the other}} side of the tracks, most passengers travelling to and from the station were obliged to take a lengthy detour from the single exit. A footpath across the tracks was added in 1925, but an approach road giving access to the station from the southern side of the railway line was not built until 1933. The station had three platforms; one platform in each direction on the London–Aylesbury line, and a bay platform alongside the up platform for trains to Chesham. A run-around loop was built to allow locomotives reversing in the bay platform always to be at the front of their trains. It was built outside the station, meaning locomotives reversing on the Chesham line were obliged <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>their</b> trains out of the station before performing the manoeuvre.|$|E
5|$|Towers {{scored the}} first Welsh try, which was {{converted}} by Jim Webb. The Natives {{replied with a}} spirited run by Ellison, but he failed {{to break through the}} Welsh defence. The tourists trailed even further after George Thomas scored a breakaway try frrm the half-way line, which went some way to silence the heckles from the crowd. Webb, playing in out of position at full-back, missed the conversion and then failed at a long distance goal from a mark. The Natives continued to push, with Elliot coming within five-yards of the try line, and when Ellison did manage to cross the line he was carried back into the 25-yard line before he could touch down. In the second half Wales continued <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>their</b> advantage when Alexander Bland dribbled the ball into the Natives' 25; this was collected by Sydney Nicholls, who managed to get the ball across the try line, allowing Jim Hannan to score. Warbrick for the Natives and Stadden for Wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries, but there were no further scores in the game.|$|E
5|$|On May 12, 1898, the United States Navy bombarded San Juan, {{initiating}} the Puerto Rican Campaign. Initially, the Liberal Party supported the Spanish government, although several members agreed with Barbosa. Muñoz Rivera took possession of Chief of the Cabinet's {{position for the}} Autonomous Government on July 21. Four days later, on July 25, the United States Army landed in Guánica led by Nelson A. Miles, beginning the land offensive. On August 13, {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Paris was made public, bringing a halt to all military offensives in Puerto Rico. As part of this amnesty, Spain ceded Cuba and Puerto Rico, converting the archipelago into a possession of the United States under military governorship. The Barbosistas welcomed the American government, but Muñoz Rivera expected them to keep Puerto Rico as a possession. He refused to cooperate with the military government and returned to Barranquitas, where he wrote a poem titled Sísifo, comparing Puerto Rico's political situation to Sisyphus' punishment. He subsequently returned to San Juan, accepting a request made by John R. Brooke to continue in his office within the new cabinet. Muñoz Rivera assisted in establishing an insular police. Brooke was replaced by Guy Vernon Henry as military governor. Following this change, both men began having violent discussions, with each one trying <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>their</b> positions. Muñoz Rivera would vocally debate several of Brooke's decisions, with both communicating via an interpreter.|$|E
2500|$|Polish {{resistance}} was offered again {{on a line}} of [...] "German trenches", a line of heavy World War I field fortifications that presented an opportunity to stem the Red Army offensive. However, the Polish troops were insufficient in number. Soviet forces found a weakly defended part of the front and broke through. Gaj-Chan and Lithuanian forces captured Vilnius on 14 July, forcing the Poles into retreat again. In Galicia to the south, General Semyon Budyonny's cavalry advanced far into the Polish rear, capturing Brody and approaching Lwów and Zamość. In early July, {{it became clear to}} the Poles that the Soviets' objectives were not limited <b>to</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>their</b> borders westwards. Poland's very independence was at stake.|$|R
6000|$|The Scudamores now hurried on, and {{presently}} {{the rumbling}} of the artillery died away, and they ventured <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> left, {{and to get}} on the road, which they found deserted. Half an hour's run, for they knew that every minute was of importance, and they heard the welcome challenge, [...] "Who comes there?" [...] "Two British officers," [...] they answered, and in a few minutes they were taken to the officer in charge of the picket, and having once convinced him of their identity, were heartily greeted and welcomed.|$|R
5000|$|Winged or hooked {{sponsons}} are {{the most}} common type. In addition to added lift during acceleration, better side-to-side stability, and reduced porpoising, they provide improved handling. [...] "The outside edge provides grip in turns, allowing you to turn sharper and faster without fear of the back end sliding out. They can also provide a pivot point for the hull in turns." [...] One of the most overlooked benefits of this type of sponson is that riders can lean into turns more, making watercraft easier <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> limits.|$|R
25|$|The Sharks have {{continued}} with another win streak of 11 games {{at home and}} on the road. Since February 21, when the Sharks played the Philadelphia Flyers away in Philadelphia and won the game 3–1, they started their lengthy winning streak. On February 29, 2008, the Sharks played the Detroit Red Wings in Detroit and came across a 3–2 win on a controversial goal by Devin Setoguchi to push the winning streak to four consecutive games. San Jose played the Montreal Canadiens on March 3 in San Jose and pulled away with a 6–4 win <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>their</b> winning streak to six games. On March 5 in San Jose, they played the Ottawa Senators and pulled away with a winner in overtime by Patrick Marleau <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>their</b> winning streak to seven games.|$|E

No one else reached base for either team, Carl Edwards Jr. pitching a perfect eighth for the Cubs, Brandon Kintzler a perfect ninth for the Nationals, and Wade Davis closing with a perfect ninth for the Cubs. With Washington managing only two hits – and none after the second inning – Chicago took a 1-0 lead in the series.|$|E
25|$|The police {{broke down}} {{the door to the}} shop, only to find large, armed group of {{defenders}} waiting for them.

Instead of retreating, the police commanders ordered their men to form a shield wall and tried <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>their</b> way into the street. The squatters responded by attempting to burn down the shop with the police inside, but the police had brought fire extinguishers with them and were able to put out the flames of the Molotov cocktail.|$|E
