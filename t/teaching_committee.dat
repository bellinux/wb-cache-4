At a follow-up conference in Stockholm in August 1953, Hand of the Cause Dorothy Beecher Baker asked for a Bahá'í to settle in Andorra and French-born William Danjon Dieudonne volunteered. He left his home in Denmark and arrived in on 7 October 1953 and so was listed as a Knight of Bahá'u'lláh thereafter. In 1954, two residents of Andorra, Carmen Tost Xifre de Mingorance and her husband, Jose Mingorance Fernandez, joined the religion.|$|E

25|$|There {{were six}} {{communities}} across Italy and Switzerland who elected 19 delegates who {{gathered for the}} convention to elect a regional national assembly {{in the city of}} Florence in the presence of Hand of the Cause Paul E. Haney and Ugo Giachary and Edna True, Chairman of the European <b>Teaching</b> <b>Committee</b> and who represented the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States at the proceedings. The proceedings included announcements of letters of `Abdu'l-Bahá to Italians, noted the attendance of 18 of the 19 delegates, elected the officers of the convention, welcomed guests, discussed the progress of the religion in the region, the role of the Bahá'í institutions, celebrated the Ridván events, and the actual secret ballot election of the national assembly. Its first members were: Dr. Ugo Giachery, Friedrich Schar, Dr. Alessandro Bausani, Marion Little, Prof. Mario Fiorentini, Anna Kunz, Stella Lanzar, Anne Lynch, and Elsa Steinmetz. Letters from the eleven other national assemblies then in existence were shared and there was an announcement that these assemblies were welcomed to a continental conference in Sweden later in the same year. Workshops at the convention were held on Bahá'í administration and tributes paid to various firsts in the community. A public session was then held at which Ugo Giachery spoke on the theme of a universal fermentation giving rise to civilization. Alessandro Bausani was a member of this regional assembly during all the years of its existence.|$|E
25|$|Geresina Campani of Florence {{may have}} been the only Bahá'í to remain alive and active through World War II. Starting in 1946 Shoghi Effendi drew up plans for the American Bahá'í {{community}} to send pioneers to Europe; the pioneers set up a European <b>Teaching</b> <b>Committee</b> chaired by Edna True. Possibly the first Bahá'ís after WWII to enter Italy were Angeline and Ugo Giachery. They reached Naples on 20 February 1947 and sent a telegram to Shoghi Effendi from Rome. By the end of March the first Italian convert was enrolled in Genoa. He was Augnsto Salvetti who heard of the religion from a Persian believer while he was a prisoner of war in India and investigated the religion on return to Italy. Brother Rodolfo Salvetti soon followed joining the religion - and pioneers Mr. and Mrs. Phillip Marengella arrived in Italy by mid-1947. There was also one Bahá'í in Milan - perhaps a Turkish refugee. By early 1948 two more Italians had joined the religion - Verena Venturini and Luigi Peveri. By Ridván 1948 the first Local Spiritual Assembly of Rome was elected. In 1948, Marion Little pioneered to Florence from America. Well known Bahá'í Dorothy Beecher Baker who was later named as a Hand of the Cause undertook a trip from 1948 across Europe including visiting Italy. Publications in Italian began with an introductory pamphlet which was sent to prominent citizens and to four hundred public libraries. This was followed by a new edition of John Esslemont's Bahá`u'lláh and the New Era, a special copy of which, bound in tooled green leather, was sent to the archives of the Bahá'í Faith in Palestine. Until 1964 when she returned to America, she served as chairman of the Italian Publishing Committee, a field which gave scope to her artistic and administrative skills. Under her direction and guidance many of the major Writings of the Faith were translated into Italian and published. She died in 1980 and her body buried in Cap d'Ail Cemetery, near Monaco. William Sutherland Maxwell came to Italy to begin reviewing materials for the expansion of the Shrine of the Bab in 1948 which continued through 1951 with shipments to Palestine for the project. Architect Andrea Rocca, Professor Emeritus of the Beaux Arts Academy of Carrara, assisted in work with the Shrine as well as the later International Archives building. The first all-Bahá'í Italian family came to be in April 1949 followed by the conversion of 81-year-old Giuseppe Berardi by July.|$|E
2500|$|Increasingly {{from the}} 1930s Leroy Ioas, {{chair of the}} Bahá'í National <b>Teaching</b> <b>Committee,</b> {{emphasized}} [...] "fireside" [...] meetings in individual homes as a key way for individuals to help the religion as well as pioneers, or those who would voluntarily relocate {{for the advancement of}} the religion, instead of brief visits by speakers. At the same time Shoghi Effendi initiated steps in implementing the directives of the Tablets of the Divine Plan pushing the American community to diffuse from its few cities to embrace every state in the country as well as international goals starting in South America. The Gregory family moved to Haiti for three months and developed a substantial group of Bahá'ís there. And the South became half the focus of the first set of plans for promulgating the religion in more cities starting in 1937. [...] Additionally delegates for the national convention were re-designated to be porpotional to state populations rather simply which communities had assemblies so South Carolina began to hold statewide conventions to elect delegates.|$|E

2500|$|A {{regional}} National Spiritual Assembly for Central America in 1951 when {{also the}} Quepos assembly was re-elected. A {{letter of the}} regional assembly noted that [...] "Considerable attention is being paid to stressing the need throughout the area of a much {{greater understanding of the}} administration of the religion. Local assemblies are being taught, by means of the National <b>Teaching</b> <b>Committee</b> and the Baha'i Bulletin to acquire a much higher concept of their own importance as governing bodies. They are being groomed slowly but surely to realize that they are not merely groups of nine people gathered together in a purely spiritual unity, but nine members of a governing body, gathered together to maintain order and peace in their own communities, resolve their problems through the medium of prayer and consultation and to devise efficient ways and means of spreading the Faith in the territory under their immediate jurisdiction." [...] The second and third meeting of the regional assembly was held in San Jose. And San Jose hosted the second election of the regional assembly in April 1952. Hand of the Cause Dorothy Beecher Baker attended the convention. Another Hand of the Cause, Dhikru'llah Khadem, visited the reformed community in Limón in 1953. The 1954 elected regional assembly also met in San Jose and pioneers returned to Puntarenas and Heredia while the assembly of Escasu was again elected. In April 1956 Alajuela was again listed as an active community (but not an assembly yet.) In 1958 Esmarilda Thompson de Vega pioneered into the rural lands near Guanacaste. In July 1960 the last convention for the regional assembly was again held in San Jose.|$|E
2500|$|A {{regional}} National Spiritual Assembly for Central America, Mexico and the Antilles {{was then}} elected in 1951 attended by Dorothy Baker and Horace Holley serving as special representatives. The convention hosted 25 delegates from Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Jamaica. Following the election {{a letter of}} the regional assembly noted that [...] "Considerable attention is being paid to stressing the need throughout the area of a much {{greater understanding of the}} administration of the religion.

[...] The 1952 members were Raquel Constante, Cora Oliver, James Facey, Elena Marella, Artemus Lamb, Louise Caswell, Zenayda Jurado, David Escalante, and Randolph Fitz–Henley. 1955's convention was held in Mexico City with 27 delegates, 16 of whom attended. During this time Auxiliary Board members, assistants to Hands of the Cause at the time, carried on a campaign of visiting many communities with many pioneers still being coordinated by the regional assembly. The first assembly of Monterrey formed in 1956. In July 1956 the first Mexican conference was held about issues specific to Mexico about the promulgation of the religion.|$|E
2500|$|It was in 1958 {{that the}} Bahá'ís of Kampala {{contracted}} to reserve {{a segment of}} a cemetery for use by Bahá'ís. Weekend schools begun in 1958 continued through 1960 though classes now used chapters from Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era by John Esslemont. In September 1961, a number of permanent Bahá'í schools were set uptwo Louis Gregory Bahá'í Schools, one in Tilling, the home town of Olinga, {{and the other in}} Dusai. Courses emphasized homecraft and child rearing mixed with presentations on the religion and men supported women taking the courses. News of the openings was covered in Jet Magazine. The extraordinary number of enrollments in Uganda and Kenya had reached the point in late 1959 that the institution of the Hands of the Cause were noting there were not enough Bahá'ís {{to keep up with the}} work of checking the enrollments. [...] 1961 also saw the development of a Ugandan Bahá'í publishing trust. Olinga was able to re-visit Uganda in June, and again in August–September 1962 when he toured widely in Uganda speaking to many groups amounting to thousands of people about the religion before moving on to Kenya and Tanganyika and the Congo. As the monthly rate of growth reached into the hundreds, a goal of the Uganda <b>Teaching</b> <b>Committee</b> was of stimulating the individual assemblies and believers to assume increasing responsibility for weekend schools in their own villages so that traveling teachers could focus in other areas. In September 1962 Milton Obote, then Prime Minister of Uganda, visited the Shrine of the Bab. In 1963 Nakhjavani was elected to the Universal House of Justice, the governing body of the worldwide Bahá'í community, while Olinga chaired the first Bahá'í World Congress which announced the election to the world. [...] By the end of 1963 there were 554 Local Spiritual Assemblies in various localities, 389 smaller Bahá'í groups, and some 200 isolated individual Bahá'ís spread across Uganda. In 1964 the regional Assemblies were reassigned and Uganda joined with the Central African Republic. The July 1964 issue of Uganda Argus profiled the religion as well as a broad article about the 4 Bahá'í Houses of Worship then in existence. One hundred thirty-two delegates and visitors assembled in Kampala, Uganda, for the 1966 convention to elect the regional national assembly of Uganda and Central Africa. Olinga was able to visit Uganda again from October to December 1967 for an extended tour of the country. Rapid expansion of the religion in the late 1960s was most particularly true in Uganda, Vietnam and Indonesia. The 1968 membership of the regional national assembly of Uganda and Central Africa was: Hassan Sabri, Tito Wanantsrusri, Kolonerio Oule, Elizabeth Olinga, George William Ebetu, Moses Senoga, Sospateri Isimai, Alinote Colleque, and Albert Ocnamodek. During the period of Ayyám-i-Há 1969 the Bahá'ís had a public exhibit on the religion at the Kamapala national theatre. The mayor of Kampala spoke at the opening preceding the showing of the film, [...] "And His Name Shall Be One". The exhibit consisted of books, charts, artifacts, photographs, movies, slides, and recordings. Original Tablets, books, and excerpts written by the Báb, Bahá'u'lláh, and `Abdu'l-Bahá were displayed along with secondary works. Bahá'í history was illustrated in a chart depicting events from the birth of Bahá'u'lláh to the founding of the Universal House of Justice, plus displays of The Dawn-Breakers in three languages. The arts were shown in oil paintings, photographs, silverwork, and handwoven carpets and the diversity of nationalities and religious backgrounds was illustrated with photographs and slides taken during conventions, Temple dedications, and intercontinental conferences. Later that summer Ruhiyyih Khanum visited Uganda on a ten-day tour. In Kampala she was able to attend several events before driving into the countryside to visit Bahá'ís. In town events included: a reception given in her honor and that of two visiting members of the Universal House of Justice, Hushmand Fatheazam and 'Ali Nahkjavani; to deliver a public lecture in the hall of the national theater; to be interviewed for a full half hour on Radio Uganda on the [...] "Guest of the Week" [...] program; and attend a wedding at the temple along with fellow Hands of the Cause Enoch Olinga and Músá Bánaní before going on to Ethiopia and other countries on a four-month tour. She returned at the end of the tour for a few days of low key meetings with Bahá'ís before her final departure.|$|E
