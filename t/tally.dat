In February, 11 aircraft brought his <b>tally</b> to 57—four fell on the 16th. After achieving his 57th he probably downed a 58th—a Hannover CL.III—but it went down over enemy lines under control as McCudden's guns seized having already fired 300 rounds at his first victim.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, the Kernel Density Estimator (KDE), a nonparametric {{probability}} density estimator, is studied {{and used to}} represent global Monte Carlo (MC) <b>tallies.</b> KDE is also employed to remove the singularities from two important Monte Carlo <b>tallies,</b> namely point detector and surface crossing flux <b>tallies.</b> Finally, KDE is also applied to accelerate the Monte Carlo fission source iteration for criticality problems. In the conventional MC calculation histograms are used to represent global <b>tallies</b> which divide the phase space into multiple bins. Partitioning the phase space into bins can add significant overhead to the MC simulation and the histogram provides only a first order approximation to the underlying distribution. The KDE method is attractive because it can estimate MC <b>tallies</b> in any location within the required domain without any particular bin structure. The quantitative and numerical convergence properties of KDE <b>tallies</b> are also investigated. Monte Carlo point detector and surface crossing flux <b>tallies</b> are two widely used <b>tallies</b> but they suffer from an unbounded variance. As a result, the central limit theorem {{can not be used}} for these <b>tallies</b> to estimate confidence intervals. By construction, KDE <b>tallies</b> can be directly used to estimate flux at a point but the variance of this point estimate does not converge as 1 /N, which is not unexpected for a point quantity. However, an improved approach is to modify both point detector and surface crossing flux <b>tallies</b> directly by using KDE within a variance reduction approach by taking advantage of the fact that KDE estimates the underlying {{probability density}} function. This methodology is demonstrated by several numerical examples. KDE is also applied to Monte Carlo eigenvalue calculations for nuclear reactor analyses. KDE is used to estimate the fission source distribution {{at the end of each}} generation and realizations from the estimated source distribution are used as the starting locations for the next generation. The source convergence is measured by the relative source entropy. Significant source convergence improvement is observed for the proposed KDE method compared to the conventional Monte Carlo fission source iteration...|$|R

50|$|<b>Tallying</b> is done {{manually}} in {{the presence}} of representatives of all contesting parties. Party <b>tallying,</b> which is easier, is done first so that returns may be announced quickly. Individual candidate <b>tallying</b> is done next and can take several days. Once the number of seats per party and constituency is determined, the seats are filled on a top-down basis from the individual cross-of-preference <b>tallies.</b> Party heads and acting or past Prime Ministers are exempt from cross-of-preference voting: they are automatically placed {{at the top of their}} party list and are elected, provided their party achieves at least one seat in the particular constituency.|$|R
