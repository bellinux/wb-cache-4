5|$|Radiotherapy is {{used when}} drug {{treatment}} is failing to control <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> a growing tumor, {{such as in}} bone metastisis (most commonly), penetration of soft tissue, or compression of sensory nerves. Often, low doses are adequate to produce analgesia, thought {{to be due to}} reduction in pressure or, possibly, interference with the tumor's production of pain-promoting chemicals. Radiopharmaceuticals that target specific tumors have been used to treat <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> metastatic illnesses. Relief may occur within a week of treatment and may last from two to four months.|$|E
5|$|A {{prominent}} {{attribute of}} Toraja language {{is the notion}} of grief. The importance of death ceremony in Toraja culture has characterised their languages to express intricate degrees of grief and mourning. The Toraja language contains many terms referring to sadness, longing, depression, and mental pain. Giving a clear expression of the psychological and physical effect of loss is a catharsis and sometimes lessens <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> grief itself.|$|E

5|$|Winehouse's {{parents and}} in-laws {{publicly}} reported their numerous concerns, the latter citing {{fears that the}} two might commit suicide. Fielder-Civil's father encouraged fans to boycott Winehouse's music, and Mitch Winehouse said this would not help. Fielder-Civil was quoted in a British tabloid as saying he introduced Winehouse to crack cocaine and heroin. During a visit with Mitch Winehouse at the prison in July 2008, Fielder-Civil reportedly {{said that he and}} Winehouse would cut themselves to ease <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|However, both Clinton and Larson {{present the}} {{possibility}} that Margaret was in fact Tubman's daughter. Larson {{points out that the}} two shared an unusually strong bond, and argues that Tubman – knowing <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> a child separated from her mother – would never have intentionally caused a free family to be split apart. Clinton presents evidence of strong physical similarities, which Alice herself acknowledged. Both historians agree that no concrete evidence exists for such a possibility, and the mystery of Tubman's relationship with young Margaret remains to this day.|$|E

Cassy was previously separated from her son and daughter when they were sold; unable to endure <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> seeing another child sold, she killed her third child.|$|E

A few months later, Martha is {{led to believe that}} Hugo is going to propose to her, but instead he ends their relationship, leaving Martha {{confused}} and upset. Martha is then kidnapped by Hugo's ex-wife Suzy Sudiro (Tasneem Roc). Angelo saves Martha and she assists him with the capture and arrest of Derrick Quaid (John Atkinson).|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{realizes that}} Crump is in a {{considerable}} amount of pain and {{that the only way to}} ease the pain is to drive west. At first, Scully believes that Crump is suffering from some sort of biological contagion, but after investigating the Crumps' home, she discovers a U.S. Navy antenna array emitting ELF waves stretches beneath their property. Scully deduces that an abnormal surge in these waves somehow caused a rising pressure in the inner ear of the nearby inhabitants. Westward motion and an increase in speed seems to be the only thing to help ease <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> the increasing pressure.|$|E
5|$|Process {{theology}} {{argues that}} God is not omnipotent: rather than coercion, {{he has the}} power of divine persuasion, but he cannot force his will. Griffin, a prominent process theologian, argues that God feels <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> the world (both physically and emotionally) and does everything within his power to achieve good, but he can neither force beings to be good nor prevent evil {{because he does not}} play a coercive role in the world. Process theology teaches that, rather than creating the world ex nihilo (as Augustine proposed), God created it out of a pre-existent chaos.|$|E

5|$|The affront at {{the heart}} of Show Boat is still very alive today. It begins with the book and its {{negative}} and one-dimensional images of Black people, and continues on through the colossal and deliberate omission of the Black experience, including <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> a people traumatized by four centuries of attempted genocide and exploitation. Not to mention the appropriation of Black music for the profit of the very people who oppressed Blacks and Africans. All this continues to offend deeply. The ol' man river of racism continues to run through the history of these productions and is very much part of this (Toronto) production. It is part of the overwhelming need of white Americans and white Canadians to convince themselves of our inferiority – that our demands don't represent a challenge to them, their privilege and their superiority.|$|E
5|$|The main {{buyers of}} {{medicine}} made from slow lorises are middle- to upper-class women {{between the ages}} of 25 and 45 who primarily use loris rice wine tonic to alleviate <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> childbirth. One bottle of wine is made by mixing rice wine with the carcasses of three dead animals. Minority groups in Cambodia also use loris-based medicine for treating broken bones, asthma, and sexually transmitted diseases. A survey by primatologist Anna Nekaris etal. (2010) showed that these belief systems were so strong that the majority of respondents expressed reluctance to consider alternatives to loris-based medicines.|$|E
5|$|Then, in 1924, Buck fell pregnant. The couple {{agreed that}} she should return to England for better {{healthcare}} during the birth, and she went there {{to set up a}} home with her mother's help. In early November 1924 she gave birth prematurely to a son, Anthony, and a few days later died of poisoning from chloroform administered against <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> delivery. The grief-stricken Keable's own health worsened and he was advised to return to Tahiti; the baby, too weak to travel, was left in England with Jack and Rita Elliott, friends of the couple's since the Ralston Street salon days.

5|$|Captain Scarlet becomes Spectrum's {{foremost}} {{weapon in}} its {{fight against the}} Mysterons after {{the events of the}} pilot episode, in which the Mysterons threaten to assassinate the World President as their first act of retaliation. The original Captain Scarlet is {{killed in a car accident}} engineered by the Mysterons and replaced with a re-created Mysteron likeness. However, when the Captain Scarlet duplicate is shot by Spectrum officer Captain Blue and falls to his death from a tall structure, he returns to life with the consciousness and the normal personality of the original Captain Scarlet fully restored let alone his memories of Mysteron control, and thereafter he is free from Mysteron control. Captain Scarlet's Mysteronised body possesses two remarkable abilities: he is able to sense the presence of other Mysteron duplicates in his vicinity, and if he is injured or killed, his retro-metabolism restores him to a state of top health. Now able to deploy suicidally reckless tactics to thwart Mysteron threats, Captain Scarlet repeatedly braves <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> death in the knowledge that he will recover to face the Mysterons again.|$|E
5|$|Gouty {{patients}} are, generally, either old men or men {{who have}} so worn themselves out in youth as to have brought on a premature old age—of such dissolute habits none being more common than the premature and excessive indulgence in venery and the like exhausting passions. The victim goes to bed and sleeps in good health. About {{two o'clock in the}} morning he is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle or instep. The pain is like that of a dislocation and yet parts feel as if cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers and a little fever... The night is passed in torture, sleeplessness, turning the part affected and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of body being as incessant as <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> the tortured joint and being worse as the fit comes on.|$|E
5|$|In the Conquest route, the Avatar both {{fights in}} the war against Hoshido, and works with their adoptive family to change Nohr's brutal {{reputation}} from within. After Azura reveals that King Garon has been replaced by an impostor, the Avatar decides to have Garon sit upon the magical throne of Hoshido, which will remove the false Garon's disguise. During the invasion of Hoshido, the Nohrians spare Hinoka and capture Sakura, while Takumi, whose behavior has become increasingly erratic and violent throughout the war, apparently dies by jumping off of a rampart. Garon orders the Avatar to kill Ryoma. After their fight, Ryoma spares the Avatar <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> killing their own brother by killing himself. Infusing the Yato with the power of Xander and Leo's Legendary Weapons, the Avatar confronts and kills the false Garon. However, a crazed Takumi suddenly appears and attacks them, and it is revealed he has been long dead and his body is possessed. The Avatar destroys Takumi's body to free his soul. Azura overuses her powers as in the Birthright route, but her death is not seen and she is instead marked as missing. In the epilogue, Hinoka is crowned queen of Hoshido and Xander is crowned king of Nohr, and a peaceful alliance between the two kingdoms is formed.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the episode}} was filmed on the Daedalus set. Due to that, visual effects were {{required}} {{to fill in the}} external shots. The episode was reportedly {{one of the most expensive}} VFX budgets in the series, and is the most expensive for the season. The star map behind the captain's chair of the Daedalus is usually lit green. However, the episode's writer and supervising producer, Alan McCullough, deliberately turned the map 90 degrees and changed the color from green to orange, so as to make the ship different from the normal Daedalus. McCullough also stated that the episode is a one-off, but did not rule out a return beyond the fifth season. He also said that he originally planned the team to visit a reality where the Ancients won the war against the Wraith, but this idea was dropped as it would detract from the main storyline. The episode was Jason Momoa's first appearance with his customised wig. After he had his hair cut by the time the fourth season was completed, for the first three episodes he had it sewn back on. However, when SCI FI wouldn't allow his hairstyle to be changed, they switched to the wig after Momoa complained about <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> having his hair sewn on again.|$|E
5|$|Seetharamudu was a {{barrister}} {{who returned}} from London upon his father's death to manage his family businesses. He was a zamindar and {{was fond of}} cars. In one such instance, he sees a poor farmer called Ramalakshmi and decides to marry her. Asked by a mediator, she accepts the proposal, without meeting Seetharamudu, but asks him for six months' delay as she has to buy new clothes for the bridegroom, following the village's tradition. Seetharamudu learns about this and meets her as a reformed thief. With his help, Ramalakshmi could cultivate enough grain in three months and buy new clothes with that money. On the day of marriage, she is surprised to know that Seetharamudu is her chosen groom and they marry. On 14 February 1924 the couple goes out, but Chaitanya, suffering from fever then, fakes a stomach ache so that his parents return. The plan works and the couple rush home at high speed but die in an accident at 10:20 AM near the same clock tower where Radha Mohan and Krishna Veni would die. Now he aims to reunite them without letting them recollect their past as they cannot bear <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> losing him.|$|E

Data-Sora defeats Data-Roxas and is allowed access to the deepest portion of Castle Oblivion. There he and Mickey encounter a virtual Naminé, who reveals the real Naminé as the one who left the message after discovering a set of memories relating to the people tied to the real Sora's heart—Roxas, Axel, Xion, Terra, Aqua, and Ventus—while restoring his lost memories; the bugs are also revealed to have been an unintentional side effect of her message. Before disappearing, Data-Naminé explains that it is the real Sora's duty to save these people. Mickey relays this message to Sora through the bottled letter shown at the end of Kingdom Hearts II.|$|E
