5|$|Following Nate's {{declaration}} as {{a tropical}} cyclone, the Government of Mexico issued {{a tropical storm}} warning stretching from Chilitepec to Celestún, noting that tropical storm conditions were likely within 12 hours. Early on September 8, a tropical storm watch was issued from Celestún to Progreso. A day later, a tropical storm watches were issued from La Cruz to <b>Tampico</b> and Veracruz to Punta El Lagarto. A hurricane watch was issued from <b>Tampico</b> to Veracruz, and three hours later, all tropical storm warnings were discontinued. On September10, the tropical storm watch stretching from Veracruz to Punta El Lagarto was discontinued, and a tropical storm warning was issued from <b>Tampico</b> to Punta El Lagarto. By 1500UTC, all tropical storm watches were discontinued, and at 2100UTC, the tropical storm warning area was modified to <b>Tampico</b> to Tuxpan. At this time, the hurricane watch area was modified to <b>Tampico</b> to Tuxpan, and a hurricane warning was issued from <b>Tampico</b> to Veracruz. The following day, this hurricane warning was changed to a tropical storm warning following Nate's weakening trend. All hurricane watches were discontinued, and during the afternoon hours, all tropical storm warnings were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|On March 7, 1914, he {{returned}} to Veracruz with the information he had gathered and presented it to his commanders. The invasion plan was eventually scrapped when authorities loyal to Victoriano Huerta detained a small American naval landing party (that had gone ashore to buy gasoline) in <b>Tampico,</b> Mexico, which led to {{what became known as}} the <b>Tampico</b> Affair.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, <b>Tampico</b> {{was left}} without power or communications. About 15,000people became {{homeless}} {{due to the}} storm, or previously from Hurricane Gladys. The governor of Tamaulipas {{declared a state of}} emergency and requested assistance from the military to provide food and shelter. Within a day after the storm, water access was restored, although the city initially remained without power or telephone. Communications were cut to <b>Tampico,</b> except for the airport at the radio. The rail line from Laredo, Texas to Mexico City was cut during the storm, but was restored ten days later. Due to ongoing flood conditions, there was an outbreak of dysentery that killed two children. The Mexican government flew medical supplies, food, and clothing from Mexico City to <b>Tampico,</b> while four United States helicopters assisted in rescue missions along the Pánuco River. About 10days after Hilda struck <b>Tampico,</b> Hurricane Janet affected the same area, causing further damage and deaths. Collectively, the two hurricanes caused 1,240deaths along their paths, and damage from the consecutive storms totaled about half of Mexico's 1955 national budget. After the two hurricanes, the Mexican government and military worked to assist the affected residents, and the Mexican Red Cross provided vaccinations and medical assistance to prevent the spread of disease.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, food and medical supplies rapidly diminished. After the storm dissipated, doctors and nurses traveled to the city to assist in {{the aftermath}}, while trains carried food and water. A train from Monterrey to <b>Tampico</b> carried food, medicine, and soldiers to assist in rebuilding, but was delayed by ongoing flooding. Military planes were utilized to transport aid. Martial law was declared in <b>Tampico</b> following the storm, and officials imposed a 7 p.m. curfew. Uninjured citizens helped clear the roads. President Abelardo L. Rodríguez asked the governors of the Mexican states to send aid and for residents to send money to the Bank of Mexico. Following the storm, residents overcrowded the buildings that remained standing in <b>Tampico.</b>|$|E
5|$|On September 28, 2017, {{according}} to the Associated Press, rain in <b>Tampico,</b> on northeastern Mexico's Gulf coast, included fish.|$|E
5|$|After visiting Madeira and Jamaica, {{the ship}} arrived in Veracruz, Mexico, on 9 February to relieve her sister ship, , and protect British {{interests}} during the ongoing Mexican Revolution. Two weeks later, she visited Galveston, Texas, before heading for <b>Tampico,</b> Mexico where she arrived on 11 March. Essex only {{spent a few}} days there before returning to Veracruz on 13 March. She was in <b>Tampico</b> when Mexican soldiers briefly detained American sailors buying gasoline for their ship on 9 April (the <b>Tampico</b> Affair) and returned to Veracruz ten days later, {{two days before the}} Americans began landing there on 21 April. They were not satisfied by the Mexican apologies and U.S. President Woodrow Wilson ordered the city occupied in retribution and to forestall a major arms delivery to Victoriano Huerta's forces. The Mexicans resisted and stray bullets hit Essex the next day, wounding one man who was shot in both feet. Tweedie, escorted by two ratings, was sent to take dispatches for the British Minister in Mexico City on the 26th and returned two days later. Rear-Admiral Christopher Craddock inspected the ship and her crew on 5–6 May. Essex sailed for <b>Tampico</b> on 10 May before leaving Mexican waters on the 14th. A month later, the ship was in Quebec City when she was visited by the Canadian Minister of Marine and Fisheries on 16 June. The following month, Essex ferried the Governor General of Canada, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, to Newfoundland and Labrador before returning to Quebec City on 20 July.|$|E
5|$|His {{small body}} of troops arrived in June. He guarded the site against looters from the Spanish {{settlements}} of <b>Tampico</b> and Pánuco until the salvage expedition arrived, and remained during the salvage operation from 23 July to 12 September.|$|E
5|$|On September18, a heavy {{northern}} gale wrecked {{the ship}} Smoker {{on the bar}} at <b>Tampico,</b> Tamaulipas, in Mexico. On September19, two ships were capsized, the John Howell and the J.K.L. After the latter sunk, 10people drowned, including the captain. No specific locations are known for these shipwrecks so no complete track for this storm is known, but it {{was active in the}} western Gulf of Mexico beginning on September18. The storm made landfall early on September19 in a rural area of Tamaulipas to the north of <b>Tampico.</b> Based on John Kaplan and Mark DeMaria's inland decay model created in 1995, it is estimated that the cyclone dissipated several hours later.|$|E
5|$|Over land, the {{hurricane}} weakened to a tropical storm, although it re-intensified {{slightly in the}} Gulf of Mexico. On September25, it made a second landfall just south of <b>Tampico,</b> Tamaulipas with winds at around , and it quickly dissipated over land. Damage was heaviest there, estimated at $5million (1933USD) and {{there were hundreds of}} deaths. About 75% of the houses in <b>Tampico</b> were damaged, including about 50% of houses that had severe to total destruction to their roofs. The destruction prompted the declaration of martial law, and there was a curfew instated.|$|E
5|$|Texas earned {{awards for}} her {{service in the}} <b>Tampico</b> Incident, World War I, and World War II. For her service in World War II Texas earned five battle stars, {{one for each of}} the major campaigns she participated in, among other awards.|$|E
5|$|As a {{counselor}} in the First Presidency, Monson dedicated seven church temples: Buenos Aires Argentina Temple, 1986' Louisville Kentucky Temple, 2000; Reno Nevada Temple, 2000; <b>Tampico</b> México Temple, 2000; Villahermosa México Temple, 2000; Mérida México Temple, 2000; and Veracruz México Temple, 2000. Monson attended {{the dedication of}} many other LDS Church temples {{as a member of}} the Quorum of the Twelve and the First Presidency.|$|E
5|$|In February 1913, {{unrest in}} Mexico {{led to a}} coup d'état {{and the death of}} deposed President Francisco I. Madero. For the {{protection}} of American interests, Idaho deployed to <b>Tampico</b> in May and to Veracruz in June. Upon returning, she was placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet on 27 October 1913.|$|E
5|$|In <b>Tampico,</b> {{near the}} {{location}} of the storm's second landfall, the streets were littered with fallen trees branches, utility poles, and billboards. Additionally, many roads were inundated with water, leaving some impassable. Nearby, over 700people fled their homes for shelter due to flooding in Ciudad Madero. One death occurred in Pueblo Viejo when a woman was crushed by a tree that fell on her house. Six other deaths occurred in Veracruz, five from a ship capsizing near Boca del Río and another after a person was caught in an undertow offshore Úrsulo Galván. Two landslides in northern Puebla left roads impassable, isolating some communities such as Tlatlauquitepec. Hundreds of homes were destroyed leaving 35,000people homeless and there was severe damage in Tuxpan, Tamiahua, Pueblo Viejo, Platon, Pánuco, <b>Tampico</b> Alto, and elsewhere along the coast of northeast Mexico.|$|E
5|$|People marked Reagan's {{death by}} leaving tributes and condolences at U.S. {{embassies}} and consulates overseas, {{as well as at}} locales around the country significant to Reagan's life, including his presidential library, his birthplace in <b>Tampico,</b> Illinois, the funeral home where his body was taken after he died, and the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity house in Eureka, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish again {{arranged}} for their coastline to be mapped, and in September 1783, José de Evia left Havana {{to chart the}} coastline between Key West and Matagorda Bay. During his journey, Evia gave Galveston Bay its name, {{in honor of his}} sponsor, De Gálvez. Evia later mapped the Nuevo Santander coast between Matagorda Bay and <b>Tampico,</b> part of which later belonged to Texas.|$|E
5|$|The other landfalling {{hurricane}} was {{one that}} struck near <b>Tampico,</b> where it caused heavy damage. The last tropical storm of the season made landfall on Rhode Island, though associated damage is unknown. A tropical storm affected the Lesser Antilles in early July, and another tropical storm remained nearly stationary for three days to the southeast of North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} {{developed}} {{very close to}} shore, it only briefly traveled west-northwest before making landfall near Tuxpan, Veracruz, Mexico early on June 29 as a weak tropical storm. It continued inland, producing heavy rain over the state of Veracruz until dissipating over the mountains of San Luis Potosí late on June 29. Hundreds of homes were damaged, and several towns, including Naranjos and Chinampa, about 60miles (95km) south of <b>Tampico,</b> were severely flooded, but the only reported fatalities were the two occupants of a car that was swept away by floodwaters in Naranjos.|$|E
5|$|During {{her stay}} in New York, President Woodrow Wilson ordered {{a number of}} ships of the Atlantic Fleet to Mexican waters in {{response}} to tension created when a detail of Mexican federal troops detained an American gunboat crew at <b>Tampico.</b> The problem was quickly resolved locally, but Rear Admiral Henry T. Mayo sought further redress by demanding an official disavowal of the act by the Huerta regime and a 21-gun salute to the American flag.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains {{fell over}} Taumalipas, with 348.8mm {{measured}} along the Tamesí River. Widespread flooding forced some 400families to evacuate throughout the state; 70trapped families in El Mante {{had to be}} rescued from their flooded homes. At {{the height of the}} storm, high-voltage electrocutions due to downed power lines caused two deaths in the municipalities of <b>Tampico</b> and Reynosa while critically injuring two workers in Matamoros. By July4, two more deaths were reported in the state, though their causes remain unspecified. Approximately 40,000residents suffered property damage to their homes. A state of emergency was declared in the municipalities of <b>Tampico,</b> Ciudad Madero, Altamira, and González in light of the damage. Broken drains and sewers in the storm's wake increased the risk of cholera through contaminated water. Damage estimates in Tamaulipas exceeded Mex$67million (US$5.8million). In neighboring San Luis Potosí, Arlene dropped 12.18in (309.4mm) of rain and claimed the lives of five people, two due to drownings. Landslides left dozens of communities isolated, and more than 600residents fled from flooded areas, particularly in Ciudad Valles, Tamazunchale, El Naranjo, and Xilitla.|$|E
5|$|In the Gulf of Mexico, the British {{steamship}} Rosina {{encountered the}} hurricane. The storm damaged the pipes and smokestacks, ripped out the ventilator, and washed 30,000oranges into the sea. Additionally, a Greek sailor was swept overboard and presumably drowned. The storm sunk or drove many ships ashore along the Yucatán Peninsula. Communications were disrupted {{in many areas}} after telegraph lines fell, while a number of roads were left impassible after trees toppled. In the <b>Tampico</b> area, there was considerable damage to the port and many ships being sunk or driven ashore. All of the bridges along Monterey and Mexican Gulf Railroad were destroyed. The roof at the general market was almost completely torn off. Many of the businesses suffered serious losses after rain subsequently poured in the building, with damage reaching at least $4,200 (10,000pesos). The chamber of commerce building collapsed with people inside, though no injuries or deaths occurred. Much of the land between <b>Tampico</b> and Cárdenas in San Luis Potosí was submerged due to flooding. In Barra, a city in Tamaulipas, the hospital was nearly destroyed, as was the marketplace. In San Luis Potosí, the casino and restaurant in Tamasopo were demolished. Twenty bridges were destroyed in San Luis Potosí. Railroad traffic between San Luis Potosí and Monterrey, the capital of Nuevo León, was completely disrupted.|$|E
5|$|Janet {{made its}} final {{landfall}} in the Mexican state of Veracruz between {{the cities of}} Nautla and Veracruz as a Category2 hurricane at 2200UTC on September29. In Nautla, communications were cut by strong winds from the hurricane. The strong winds also caused a relief plane to crash, causing five deaths. Heavy rains in the <b>Tampico,</b> Tamaulipas area added to floods caused by hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the year. The resulting flood was reported by the Weather Bureau office in New Orleans {{to be one of}} the worst natural disasters in Mexican history. In <b>Tampico,</b> 16in (410mm) of rain was reported. The floods contributed to a localized typhoid fever and dysentery outbreak, causing over 1,000people to evacuate out of the city to prevent further spreading of the diseases. An additional 36,000people were being cared for in concentration centers. Although located south of where Janet made landfall, areas of Veracruz were inundated by strong storm surge, including the city's main streets and port. Operations along a railroad stretching from Laredo, Texas to Mexico City were stopped, after having just reopened due to Hurricane Hilda.|$|E
5|$|Of the season's five {{tropical}} cyclones, four reached hurricane status. Furthermore, one {{of those}} four strengthened into a major hurricane, which are Category3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The strongest cyclone of the season, Hurricane Five, peaked at Category3 strength with 125mph (205km/h) winds. It brought only minor impact to Louisiana and Mississippi. The first storm of the season brought locally severe impact to <b>Tampico,</b> Tamaulipas, Mexico in early August. Tropical Storm Four caused severe damage in the Lesser Antilles.|$|E
5|$|The 1933 {{season was}} the most active of its time, surpassing the {{previous}} record-holder of 19storms in 1887. Fifteen of the season's storms made landfall as tropical cyclones, and another struck land as an extratropical storm. Eight tropical storms, including six hurricanes, hit the United States during the season, including the Chesapeake–Potomac hurricane, which the U.S. Weather Bureau described {{as one of the}} most severe in history along the Mid-Atlantic States. Seven tropical storms, including four hurricanes, hit Mexico, two of which caused severe damage in the <b>Tampico</b> area.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{was also}} expected to re-strengthen prior to its second landfall in Mexico, though the Weather Bureau also noted {{that there was a}} chance for the storm to affect Texas. Although the possibility never materialized, the agency expected rain bands and rough seas to affect southern Texas, and small watercraft were urged to remain in ports until the hurricane moved inland. On August 21, the cyclone was expected to move ashore between Nautla and Tuxpan, though it eventually made landfall further north near <b>Tampico.</b> Local officials expressed concerns about residents in huts and other vulnerable structures. In the Harlingen Valley region of southern Texas, precautionary measures were taken and Red Cross divisions organized a meeting at the local city hall. City departments and facilities were ready for disposal if the cyclone moved closer to the area. The cyclone's rains were {{also expected to}} impact unpicked cotton plants in the region. In advance of the storm, a Coast Guard plane dropped messages from the air to several vessels, advising them to seek shelter. In <b>Tampico,</b> oil industries erected barriers to protect fields, and authorities planned to evacuate residents from the surrounding low-lying areas. Thousands of residents stayed in refugee centers on elevated ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{warnings}} {{remained in}} effect for twelve hours, then they were discontinued north of Port Mansfield in Texas. The hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning in all areas between Port Mansfield southwards to <b>Tampico.</b> It was predicted the rains from Beryl could produce dangerous flash floods and mudslides over the mountainous areas of Mexico. When Beryl made landfall early on August 15, all warnings were discontinued in Texas. All warnings issued in the Government of Mexico were discontinued six hours later when Beryl was downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completion}} of a major overhaul at the New York Naval Shipyard, Wisconsin headed south for refresher training in the Caribbean Sea, later taking part in another Springboard exercise. During that cruise, she again visited Port-au-Prince and added <b>Tampico,</b> Mexico, and Cartagena, Colombia, to her list of ports of call. She returned to Norfolk {{on the last day}} of March 1955 for local operations. On 19 October, while operating in the East River in New York Harbor, Wisconsin was accidentally grounded. However, the ship was freed in about an hour without any serious damage.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{landfall}} near <b>Tampico,</b> {{a station}} in the city recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 1,004mbar (hPa; 29.65inHg), the lowest pressure measured {{in association with the}} storm. Due to a lack of available weather ships in the region because of World War II, no ships documented the tropical cyclone. In Texas, the tropical cyclone caused light rainfall, damaging local cotton crops. Strong wind gusts were observed in the Rio Grande Valley.|$|E
5|$|A U.S. Navy relief {{plane was}} sent to Chetumal, Mexico, to deliver food and other relief {{supplies}} after Janet struck the region. In areas previously affected by hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the year, federal relief agencies were ordered to extend relief operations to the Yucatán Peninsula. However, after crossing the Bay of Campeche and making landfall near Veracruz, relief measures were once again implemented in the western Gulf Coast of Mexico. The Mexican Air Force, commercial and private planes, and helicopters were sent to bring relief supplies and airlift refugees. The United States initiated the largest relief campaign ever staged in Mexico at the time. Various government and relief agencies, including the American Red Cross and The Salvation Army, participated in the relief efforts. The United States Air Force and United States Army began a joint-relief operation to send relief supplies to the <b>Tampico</b> area, beginning with the deployment of a Curtiss C-46 Commando from the Harlingen Air Force Base on October1. Ten other military transport aircraft from the United States Air Force were sent from Texas to provide food and clothing. Pan American World Airways sent a Boeing 314 from Miami, Florida to evacuate victims. Helicopters were sent from the USS Saipan to transfer food and medical supplies from the light aircraft carrier. Other ships also aided in delivering supplies, including the USS Siboney, which also deployed helicopters to assist in relief efforts. By October6, 1,500people were estimated to have been rescued from the <b>Tampico</b> area, and at least 280,000lb (130,000kg) of food and clothing materials were estimated to have been delivered by the US Air Force to the city. There, typhoid serum shots were administered as a precautionary measure. Former president Manuel Ávila Camacho {{died of a heart}} ailment, in part due to over-exertion in helping in the relief efforts.|$|E
5|$|Dry air {{and land}} {{weakened}} the tropical wave, {{and when it}} entered {{the area of the}} Bay of Campeche, it merged with a stationary frontal boundary. Cool, dry air around the system caused the system to develop a cold core, and the area organized into an extratropical low on September 30. A large high pressure system over the northern Gulf of Mexico forced the system southward, where it developed significant convection. The system developed a warm core, and on October 1 the storm organized into Tropical Storm Larry while located 300mi (483km) east-southeast of <b>Tampico,</b> Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Charlie was {{the deadliest}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the 1951 Atlantic hurricane season. The third named storm, second hurricane, and second major hurricane of the season, it developed from a tropical wave {{east of the}} Lesser Antilles. It moved briskly west-northwest, passing between the islands of Dominica and Guadeloupe. It strengthened to a hurricane in the eastern Caribbean Sea, and it struck Jamaica with winds near Category3 intensity. It strengthened to a peak intensity of 135mph (215km/h) prior to landfall on Quintana Roo, Yucatán Peninsula. It weakened over land, and it re-strengthened over the Gulf of Mexico before it made a final landfall near <b>Tampico.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hurricanes Arlene and Chloe, as well {{as several}} {{tropical}} depressions, originated from tropical waves that left the coast of Africa. Chloe lasted for 15days, eventually dissipating over France after wrecking a ship offshore northern Spain, killing 14people. Hurricane Doria co-existed with Beulah and Chloe, taking an unusual trajectory over the eastern United States; it killed three people in a boating accident offshore New Jersey. In late September, Tropical Storm Edith was a minimal storm that moved through the Lesser Antilles without serious impact. Hurricane Fern killed three people when it struck Mexico north of <b>Tampico.</b> Tropical Storm Ginger existed in the far eastern Atlantic in early October, and Hurricane Heidi stalled over the northern Atlantic Ocean {{at the end of the}} month.|$|E
5|$|In Martinique, {{hundreds}} of homes were deroofed in Fort-de-France, while about 5,000people were left homeless {{in the villages}} of Fond, Fourniols, La Haye, Recluce, and Tivoli, {{all of which were}} established after the eruption of Mount Pelée in 1902. The hurricane also left extensive damage to crops and eight fatalities. In Jamaica, several communities were completely or nearly destroyed, including Manchioneal, Port Antonio, and Port Maria. Thousands of homes also suffered damage in the capital city of Kingston. Banana crops were devastated so severely that many growers were forced into bankruptcy. Numerous ships were wrecked, particularly on the north coast of the island. There were at least 65deaths and about $10million (1903USD) in damage. In the Cayman Islands, more than 200houses and seven of eight churches on Grand Cayman were destroyed or heavily damaged. Of the 23ships in the harbor, only the Governor Blake survived. Most of the crews on board those ships were reported killed, but loss of life onshore was minimal. The storm also caused heavy damage on the Yucatán Peninsula. Many ships were wrecked and communications were cut off in several places. In the <b>Tampico</b> area, there was considerable damage to the port and many ships were sunk or driven ashore. Much of the land between <b>Tampico</b> and Cárdenas in San Luis Potosí was submerged due to flooding. In all, the storm is believed to have killed at least 149 people.|$|E
5|$|Starting at 2100UTC on August9, a {{tropical}} storm warning was issued from Baffin Bay, Texas to La Pesca, Tamaulipas while Gabrielle was still Tropical Depression Eight. By 0900UTC on the following day, the warning was expanded to include areas south to <b>Tampico,</b> Tamaulipas and extended further to Tuxpan, Veracruz twelve hours later. As the latter was occurring, the tropical storm warning was discontinued for Texas. Early on August12, all the warnings in Mexico were discontinued, as the storm had already moved inland. 800people were evacuated in Soto la Marina and San Fernando in Tamaulipas. People in poor villages in the Rio Grande Valley were given sandbags with Tropical Storm Gabrielle approaching.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} caused {{extensive damage}} to fishing and farming communities in northeastern Mexico. Strong winds destroyed thousands {{of homes and}} left about 25,000 people homeless, according to newspaper reports from Mexico City. The winds destroyed the roofs of most buildings near where the hurricane moved ashore, and also caused widespread power outages which disrupted communications. Heavy rainfall destroyed or obstructed roadways across the region, with some flooded avenues in <b>Tampico</b> and reports of flooded highways near Ciudad Victoria. Eleven {{people were killed in}} floods and mudslides across Tamaulipas. In all, at least 50,000 people were affected by the hurricane in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The {{season was}} {{continuously}} active, with six storms forming {{during the month}} of August alone. At the time, many storms received the distinction of being the earliest nth storm to form, such as the earliest fifth tropical storm to form in a season. Most of the records were broken in later years. During the season, the U.S. Weather Bureau issued storm and hurricane warnings for eight storms, including coastal portions of Texas, as well as from Florida to Massachusetts, forcing the evacuations of thousands of people. The deadliest storm of the season was a hurricane that struck <b>Tampico,</b> Mexico, killing over 184 residents. The costliest hurricane was the Chesapeake–Potomac hurricane, which caused $27 million in damage from North Carolina to New Jersey. The hurricane produced rainfall that resulted in severe crop damage in Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Eight caused severe {{flooding}} in southeastern Texas in late August 1981. The eighth tropical cyclone {{of the annual}} hurricane season, the depression developed from a tropical disturbance over the Bay of Campeche on August26. Moving northwestward, the cyclone failed to intensify into a tropical storm before making landfall in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas {{to the north of}} <b>Tampico</b> on August28, with winds of 35mph (55km/h). After moving inland, the depression curved north-northwestward before degenerating into a surface low pressure area near the MexicoUnited States border on August29. The remnants moved eastward across Texas and entered Louisiana before dissipating on September1.|$|E
