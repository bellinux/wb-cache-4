5|$|Lamason then {{instructed}} the group not {{to trust the}} SS, or provoke <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> way because as they had experienced on the train, the guards were unpredictable and trigger-happy. Also, they were not to explore the camp because of the chance of breaking unknown rules, but to stay together and keep {{as far away from}} the guards as possible. He further stated that acting on the group's behalf, he would make further contact with the camp authorities for recognition of their rights.|$|E
5|$|Mark Livolsi realized, as McKenna had on {{the other}} end, that the film worked best when it focused on the Andrea-Miranda storyline. Accordingly, he cut a number of {{primarily}} transitional scenes, such as Andrea's job interview and the Runway staff's trip to Holt's studio. He also took out a scene early on where Miranda complimented Andrea. Upon reviewing them for the DVD, Frankel admitted he hadn't even seen them before, since Livolsi didn't include <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> prints he sent to the director.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney is {{a visual}} novel {{adventure}} {{game in which}} the player takes the role of Phoenix Wright, a rookie defense attorney, and attempts to defend their clients in five cases. These cases are played in a specific order; after having finished cases, the player can re-play <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> order. Each case starts with an opening cinematic showing a murder; shortly thereafter, the player is given the job of defending the prime suspect of the case. The gameplay is split into two types of sections: investigations and courtroom trials.|$|E

His leave authorization also cleared him for Düsseldorf and his hometown of Krefeld, but it is unknown if he visited <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>any</b> case, he returned to duty on 22 September 1917.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{initially}} {{developed as a}} demo by Urban Squall during the group's annual development meeting, in a San Diego hotel during November 2008. The demo was further tested after the five-day meeting, resulting in the complete game being released during March. The game's theme {{was inspired by the}} short story Everything Can Be Beaten by Jhonen Vasquez, which features a monster that clubs animals to death and is unable to interact with <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> other way.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} bottom right corner, two Polish Jews are {{on the edge of}} the scene; the younger (36) one is usually {{described}} as enthralled by the events, watching them with hope, but most analysis focuses on the older man (37), whose hand is making a Sy, git ("that's good") gesture. Interpretation of this figure varies; while some suggest that he express his interest and support for the Constitution, which he sees as a promise of further reforms that will improve the situation of the Jews—the Constitution had not addressed <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> significant way—others put him, or both of the Jews, among the opponents of the Constitution, describing them as frowning and disturbed, gleefully anticipating the end of the Commonwealth, or at least concerned with the liberal reforms. The latter interpretation can be also supported by the fact that Matejko tended to portray Jews in his paintings in negative roles.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{opposition}} from the British government, a more explicit racial policy was avoided in the legislation, with the control mechanism being a dictation test, which required a person seeking entry to Australia to write out a passage of fifty words dictated to <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> European language, not necessarily English, {{at the discretion of}} an immigration officer. The test was not designed to allow immigration officers to evaluate applicants on the basis of language skills, rather the language chosen was always one known beforehand that the person would fail.|$|E

There are two types of cards: the Season Card (valid from 1 April to 31 October) and the 3-day card. When their validity runs out they can be reactivated and are therefore reusable. Bikes can be used for up to three hours per loan and can be rented from Monday to Sunday from 6 am to 10 pm.|$|E

25|$|An {{oral health}} {{assessment}} carried out before a child reaches {{the age of}} one may help with management of caries. The oral health assessment should include checking the child’s history, a clinical examination, checking the risk of caries in the child including the state of their occlusion and assessing how well equipped the child’s parent or carer {{is to help the}} child prevent caries. In order to further increase a child’s cooperation in caries management, good communication by the dentist {{and the rest of the}} staff of a dental practice should be used. This communication can be improved by calling the child by their name, using eye contact and including <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> conversation about their treatment.|$|E
25|$|The South Vietnamese {{eventually}} {{had their}} way.

Throckmorton told the Vietnamese generals that they had read too much into Taylor's comments and that the U.S. {{had no intention of}} pressuring them out of power. Khánh appeared reassured by this and made a public statement on 30 December, saying he was not as hostile to the Americans as reported, and he wanted Thiệu and Cang to meet the Americans to relieve any tension that remained. The generals eventually won out, as the Americans did not move against <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> way for their refusal to reinstate the HNC.|$|E
25|$|In 941 Marzuban and {{his brother}} Wahsudan ibn Muhammad, with the tacit {{approval}} of their mother, deposed and imprisoned their father Mahummad, whose harsh governance had alienated many of his subjects. Wahsudan replaced Muhammad as the ruler of Tarum. Muhammad, however, was approached by Abu'l-Qasim Ja'far b. 'Ali, the vizier of the ruler of Azerbaijan, Daisam. Ja'far, who had fled Azerbaijan, offered Marzuban the chance to overthrow his master and take over {{the administration of the}} province. Ja'far, Marzuban and Wahsudan were all Isma'ilis, perhaps explaining Ja'far's decision to turn to <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>any</b> case, Marzuban agreed and invaded Azerbaijan.

25|$|This was {{beneficial}} for the Crusaders as {{it meant that}} they did not have to garrison captured towns and lose troop strength whilst maintaining their supply lines. The Byzantines, in return, would supply the Crusaders with food in a hostile territory and Alexius' troops would act as a reserve to reinforce <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> dangerous situations. The Crusaders first set about attacking Nicaea on 6 May 1097. Kilij Arslan I was unable to assist the Turks there due to the immense size of the Crusader armies; another small defeat on 16 May convinced Kilij Arslan to withdraw and abandon the city, which surrendered to the Byzantines on 19 June. After this, a decisive victory at Dorylaeum gave the Crusaders an Asia Minor that was open to attack: Sozopolis, Philomelium, Iconium, Antioch in Pisidia, Heraclea and Caesarea all fell to the Crusaders and they reached as far as Cilicia where they allied with Cilician Armenia.|$|E
