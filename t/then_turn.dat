5|$|Plans {{to connect}} Ottawa with Bancroft {{arose in the}} mid-1950s. When the {{province}} designated Highway132 in January 1956, they also announced {{plans for a new}} highway which would travel south from Renfrew to Calabogie, <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> west towards Denbigh and Bancroft. Ultimately this road was never constructed, but new road links were established in the following years regardless.|$|E
5|$|On 27 October 1912 Mawson {{outlined}} the summer sledging program. Of the seven sledging parties that would depart from Cape Denison, three would head east. The Eastern Coastal Party, {{led by the}} geologist Cecil Madigan, was charged with exploring beyond the Mertz Glacier tongue; they would initially be supported by the Near Eastern Party led by Frank Stillwell, which would <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> to mapping the area between Cape Denison and the glacier.|$|E
5|$|A {{connection}} to the defunct LIRR Rockaway Beach Branch, {{not part of the}} main project, was proposed in 1963 and again in 1967, as were branches along other LIRR lines to outer Queens areas without rapid transit service. An alternate to the Southeast Queens line was also proposed in 1963 and again in 1967 {{as an extension of the}} IND Fulton Street Line, east from Euclid Avenue under Pitkin Avenue and Linden Boulevard, or east from Lefferts Boulevard under Liberty Avenue. Both options would continue east to Jamaica, <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> south under Merrick Boulevard to Springfield Boulevard. The Rockaway extension and both Fulton Line extensions were previously proposed as part of the 1929 and 1939 IND Second System plans, and were ultimately not incorporated into the main Program For Action plan.|$|E
50|$|State Route 827 is a {{state highway}} in Lyon County, Nevada. The road starts at SR 339 and heads east as Mason Road. It {{continues}} east across SR 208 and is renamed West Cremetti Lane, <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> south as MacKenzie Lane, and <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> east again onto East Pursel Lane. The highway <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> into a gravel county road.|$|R
25|$|Kennedy Creek <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> west-northwest {{for a few}} miles, {{flowing through}} a valley {{alongside}} Pennsylvania Route 524. In this reach, the creek passes by Sarnoski Hill and receives two unnamed tributaries from the right. It <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> west for several tenths of a mile, passing by Turkey Hill and receiving another unnamed tributary from the right. The creek <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> northwest for a few tenths of a mile, crossing Pennsylvania Route 524 and heading away from it. It <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> west and enters Lackawanna Lake, where it reaches its confluence with South Branch Tunkhannock Creek.|$|R
50|$|The Redknife river {{originates}} in the Redknife Hills, at {{an elevation of}} 765 m. It flows east down {{the slopes of the}} hill, <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> north, draws water from a lake system, <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> north-east. It is crossed by the Mackenzie Highway, <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> north and flows into the Mackenzie River at an elevation of 145 m, 100 km downstream from Fort Providence and 75 km upstream from Jean Marie River.|$|R
5|$|After enrolling him, Smith signed Burdell {{up for all}} {{the same}} classes he had. Smith would do all {{schoolwork}} twice, changing it slightly to avoid professors catching his sham. When he had a test, he would take it twice and <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> it in under both names. By 1930, the school had awarded Burdell a bachelor's degree, {{and a few years}} later awarded the fictitious student a master's degree. The college listed him as an official alumnus, even though his name has remained on the active student rolls. In 1930, the ANAK Society, Georgia Tech's oldest secret society, offered Burdell membership.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} Colonel Michaelis {{went to the}} 1st Cavalry Division command post in Hwanggan and asked {{division}} commander Major General Hobart R. Gay for permission to withdraw his regiment through that division. Gay telephoned the Eighth Army headquarters {{and asked if he}} should attack in an effort to relieve the pressure on the 27th Infantry, or if that regiment should withdraw into the 1st Cavalry Division's area, move south to Kumch'on, and <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> toward Sangju to rejoin the 25th Division. The Eighth Army decided the 27th Regiment should withdraw, as Gay feared it would quickly be surrounded if it tried to hold its position.|$|E
5|$|MD 300 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MD 213 (Church Hill Road) {{in the northern}} part of the town of Church Hill. The highway heads east as two-lane Sudlersville Road and intersects MD 19 (Main Street) before leaving the town. The state highway heads northeast and intersects US 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway) at a superstreet intersection next to a park and ride lot in the southwest quadrant. Traffic on MD 300 is required to turn right onto US 301, perform a U-turn, <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> right again to continue on MD 300. The highway curves east at Dudley Corners, where the route crosses Red Lion Branch and meets the southern end of MD 290 (Dudley Corner Road) and the north end of Benton Corners Road, which leads to the historic Dudley's Chapel.|$|E
50|$|Lick Run {{starts in}} {{southern}} Locust Township north of a mountain. It flows northeast into central Locust Township and <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> north {{for a short}} distance.

50|$|From Jish, the 72nd and 79th battalions <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> west to take Sa'sa. After taking Sa'sa the Israeli forces <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> {{northwest}} taking Kfar Birem, Saliha and by {{the afternoon}} of the 30 October were at al Malikiya.|$|R
5|$|Once air-to-air combat began over North Vietnam, the Air Force {{was again}} found lacking. The {{mainstay}} missiles {{of the air}} war {{turned out to be}} the Navy-developed AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow, not its own AIM-4 Falcon. The Air Force continuously opposed adapting to the war in Southeast Asia, since its leadership believed that it was an aberration that would be quickly resolved. It could <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> its attention (and its more modern weapons) against the greater threat posed by the Soviet Union. None in the Air Force high command foresaw that the war would drag on for nearly a decade.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass and Lomax <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> to {{journalist}} Jimmy Hall (Sid James), who {{is skeptical}} of their story but asks to visit Winnerden Flats. At {{the local community}} centre, they receive a hostile reception from locals employed to do heavy construction and other work at the complex. The mood changes, however, {{when one of the}} meteorite-missiles crashes through the building roof, injuring barmaid Sheila (Vera Day). Armed guards arrive and gun down Hall after he telephones the press. The villagers form a mob that marches on the complex. Rushing the gates, Quatermass, Lomax, and the villagers barricade themselves in the pressure control room.|$|E
5|$|About 23:00, German 2nd Army {{headquarters}} {{directed the}} 14th Panzer Division to penetrate past Zagreb towards Karlovac {{to link up}} with the Italian 2nd Army, and also directed the 8th Panzer Division and 16th Motorised Infantry Division {{to drive to the}} north of Belgrade to link up with the First Panzer Group which was thrusting towards Belgrade from the east. At midnight, 2nd Army headquarters declared that the Yugoslav northern front had been decisively defeated, and tasked corps engineer units to consolidate bridging across major rivers, particularly over the Sava at Bre≈æice west of Zagreb to facilitate the advance of the 14th Panzer Division towards Karlovac. The main body units of the XLVI Motorised Corps moved forward to Virovitica and Slatina, and 2nd Army headquarters moved forward to establish itself in Maribor, protected by the 538th Frontier Guard Division. At midnight, General der Panzertruppe Heinrich von Vietinghoff issued orders for the 8th Panzer Division to continue towards Belgrade via Osijek, but directed the 16th Motorised Infantry Division to thrust west as far as Sremska Mitrovica <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> south to drive towards Sarajevo via Zvornik.|$|E
50|$|Tropical Storm Bonny {{formed on}} June 22 {{southwest}} of Mexico and moved northwestward as a 45 mph (70 km/h) tropical storm. Bonny <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> northward and <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> westward before dissipating south of Baja California on June 26.|$|R
5|$|Abrahams Creek {{begins in}} Franklin Township. It flows {{south-southwest}} {{for a short}} distance before turning south for several tenths of a mile, passing through the border between Dallas Township, Franklin Township, and Kingston Township, and entering Kingston Township. The creek then continues south {{for more than a}} mile before turning southeast and eventually entering Frances Slocum Lake. On the southeastern end of the lake, the creek turns east-northeast for more than a mile, entering a deep valley. It <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> south-southeast for a few miles, entering West Wyoming flowing through a water gap. The creek <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> southeast for some distance before turning southwest and entering Wyoming. It <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> west-southwest for a few miles before <b>turning</b> south and <b>then</b> west. The creek <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> south again, crossing US Route 11. It <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> southwest for more than a mile, entering Forty Fort and reaching its confluence with the Susquehanna River.|$|R
50|$|The line {{starts from}} northeastern Tehran at Shahrak-e Qa'em going westward {{parallel}} to but 300 m north of Artesh Expressway, passing through Aghdasieh neighbourhood. <b>Then</b> it <b>turns</b> south {{at the end}} of Artesh Expressway going to Nobonyad Square. It <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> towards Sayyad Expressway and runs southward along it for about 5.6 km. At Sabalan square, it <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> west, going under Beheshti Street, intersecting with Line 1 at Shahid Beheshti Station. It <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> towards south, going under Valiasr Street for 7.7 km, until it reaches Rahahan Square, providing access to Tehran railway station. It <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> towards southwest, passing through Javadiyeh and then going along Cheraghi Expressway and Saidi Expressway. The line then terminates at Azadegan Station at the intersection of Saidi Expressway with Azadegan Expressway.|$|R
5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare {{usually has}} a single stem, but {{occasionally}} several stems arise from a thick common base. It attaches {{to the side of}} the cap and is cylindrical or slightly flattened with a bulbous base. Its surface is covered with hairy fibers (especially near the base), and its mature color is a dark chestnut brown. The cap is semicircular or kidney-shaped, flat on the lower surface and rounded on the top. The surface is at first much like the stem: covered with bristles and dark chestnut brown. However, it becomes smooth with maturity and can darken to the point of being almost black. The cap margin is usually buff to light brown‚Äìroughly the same color as the spines and lighter in color than the center. It becomes rolled inward (revolute) and often wavy in maturity. The spines on the underside of the cap are a few millimeters long and cylindrical down to their sharp tips. White to light brown when young, they later become covered with a white spore mass and <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> an ashy gray. Occasionally, fruit bodies are produced that lack a cap entirely.|$|E
5|$|Late on {{the evening}} of 11 July, Hausser, the {{commander}} of the II SS-Panzer Corps, issued orders for the next day's advance on Prokhorovka. It was known that the Red Army had dug in many anti-tank guns on the southwest slopes of Prokhorovka, making a direct attack by Leibstandarte very difficult. The plan was for Totenkopf to capture Hill 226.6, and advance northeast along the Psel River to the Kartash—ëvka-Prokhorovka road, and then strike southeast into the flank and rear of Soviet forces at Prokhorovka. Leibstandarte was ordered to make a limited advance and secure Storozhevoe and Lamki just outside Prokhorovka, then it and Das Reich were to wait until Totenkopfs attack had disrupted the Soviet positions, after which Leibstandarte was to attack the main Soviet defences on the southwest slope of Prokhorovka. To Leibstandartes right, elements of Das Reich were also to advance eastward to the high ground south of Prokhorovka, <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> south away from Prokhorovka to roll up the Soviet defences opposing the III Panzer Corps' advance and force a gap. The 8th Air Corps was to concentrate its effort to supporting the advance of the II SS-Panzer Corps, with the XLVIII Panzer Corps to the west assigned limited air resources.|$|E
5|$|Now {{with three}} lanes in each direction, the highway {{straddles}} {{the boundary between}} Salt Lake City and West Valley City, another suburb of the former. The road continues due east with diamond interchanges at 5600 West (SR-172) and Bangerter Highway (SR-154). Immediately following a single-point urban interchange (SPUI) at 3200 West, the freeway intersects I-215 {{in the form of}} a cloverleaf interchange. The road dips to the south slightly and, following two SPUIs at Redwood Road (SR-68) and 900 West, the freeway terminates at the Spaghetti Bowl interchange, giving eastbound motorists on SR-201 the option of continuing to I-15, I-80, 1300 South and 900 South. However, an eastbound traveler wanting to continue on the surface portion of SR-201 to State Street must exit on 900 West, head north briefly and <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> eastbound on 2100 South; a westbound traveler on 2100 South wishing to connect to the freeway must take an on-ramp from the surface street just before 900 West. Prior to 1997, this connection was direct. Now on the four-lane 2100 South, a secondary surface street, the route runs along the Salt Lake City-South Salt Lake border. State maintenance of 2100 South ends at the intersection of State Street (US-89).|$|E
50|$|The {{boundary}} changed {{again in}} 1987. From {{the southwest corner}} where Highway 401 crossed the Humber River the boundary followed the river north to Steeles Avenue West. It <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> east following Steeles until it reached Black Creek. It followed the river course south to Finch Avenue West. It <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> west following Finch to Keele Street. It <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> south following Keele until it reached Highway 401. It then followed Highway 401 back west to the Humber River.|$|R

5|$|Route 6 was redefined in 1929 to use {{none of the}} old road east of Paterson (it had {{formerly}} {{been planned}} to use Market Street west of roughly where Route 17 now crosses it), and Route 5 was cut back to run only east from Ridgefield. The portion of pre-1927 Route 10 that was bypassed by Route 6 was designated Route 10N, but was eventually removed from the state highway system. In addition, Route 6 was redefined to bypass Paterson to the south. The new route would enter Paterson just south of Market Street, but <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> south and southwest before heading back west to rejoin the old route at {{the east end of}} the Little Falls bypass at the Union Boulevard crossing. The old road along Union Boulevard towards Paterson was assigned Route S6, as a spur of Route 6. Route S6 became Route 62 in the 1953 renumbering, and has since been truncated to a short piece between US 46 and I-80 in Totowa.|$|E
5|$|The XLVI Motorised Corps {{encountered}} little {{resistance from}} the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska, and by the evening of 10 April the whole 4th Army was disintegrating. About 23:00, German 2nd Army headquarters directed the 8th Panzer and 16th Motorised Infantry Division {{to drive to the}} north of Belgrade to link up with the First Panzer Group which was thrusting to towards Belgrade from the east.

5|$|The first {{alignment}} of the Route 92 Freeway, proposed in the 1950s, was to begin at an interchange with Interstate 95, known as the Somerset Freeway {{in the community of}} Skillman (in Montgomery Township). The route was supposed to head eastward, crossing an interchange with U.S. Route 206 in Montgomery Township before crossing over County Route 518 in Rocky Hill and interchanging with New Jersey Route 27 in Kingston. The route would <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> to the south and interchange with U.S. Route 1 and County Route 522 in the community of Monmouth Junction. From there, Route 92 would cross over the Pennsylvania Railroad to the north of New Jersey Route 64 in Plainsboro, turning to the southeast along the Millstone River. After crossing the Millstone, Route 92 was to interchange with County Route 535 in Cranbury before entering East Windsor, where it would interchange with U.S. Route 130. From there, the route would meet the New Jersey Turnpike at Interchange 8 before reaching its eastern terminus at an interchange with New Jersey Route 33 in the Twin Rivers community in East Windsor.|$|E

5|$|On July 17, 1962, the NYCTA {{announced}} that it had asked the city for money to build a $190,000,000 high-speed, non-stop subway line from Midtown to the Bronx. The line would have only operated during rush hours. It was estimated that if the funds {{were given to the}} project, it would be completed in 1970. The line would be a two-track line running from 59th Street between Fifth and Seventh Avenues to the Bronx, running under Central Park. Running non-stop for 6.5 miles, {{it would have been the}} longest continuous run in the subway system. The line, on its southern end, would connect to the BMT Broadway Line at Seventh Avenue near 59th Street and to the IND Sixth Avenue Line near 58th Street and Sixth Avenue. The line would then run through a deep tunnel under Central Park until 110th Street. There would be provisions for a future crosstown line under 76th Street to Queens. The line would <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> east and run along Madison Avenue to 138th Street. One branch would connect to the express track of the IRT Pelham Line, which would be converted to accommodate larger B Division trains. In the morning rush hour, trains from Pelham Park would only make express stops. A new stop would be built at 138th Street and Grand Concourse where transfers would have been available to the IRT White Plains Road and IRT Jerome Avenue Line trains. The second branch would continue under the Grand Concourse until 161st Street where it would connect to the IND Concourse Line at 161st Street. This connection would allow for the diversion of Concourse Line express trains onto the new line, allowing for the addition of an equal number of trains to the Washington Heights express service and provide relief to that line. The construction of this line was viewed as necessary to relieve the IRT Lexington Avenue Line.|$|E
