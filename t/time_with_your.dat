500|$|Nancy Hoang of CMJ {{praised the}} episode's visuals, {{highlighting}} {{the incorporation of}} the short film Murmuration by Liberty Smith and Sophie Windsor Clive. Chris Martins of Spin magazine enjoyed the colorful and psychedelic visuals. He found the episode appealing to stoner culture, ending his review stating that the special is [...] "tailor-made for late nights in haze-filled dorm rooms." [...] Tom Breihan of Stereogum reviewed the special positively, calling the episode an [...] "oddly patriotic work that pulls {{in all sorts of}} American iconography". Rachel Haas of Paste magazine praised the special being released close to Independence Day, stating [...] "this suite would possibly soundtrack the coolest, weirdest fireworks show ever." [...] Leor Galil of the Chicago Reader featured the video for his [...] "12 O'Clock Track", praising Hughes' manipulation of Cityscape Chicago by cinematographer Eric Hines. However, given the tracks' length, he argued the episode would best be enjoyed [...] "through a nice pair of speakers at a barbecue instead of spending that <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> eyes affixed to a computer screen." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{talks about the}} healing effect of love. In an article for Bustle, Danielle Jackson presumed it to be love from her fans who had {{supported}} Gaga throughout her career. While performing [...] "The Cure" [...] at 'Coachella', the singer said to the crowd: [...] "I love you guys so much. I have {{been through so much}} in my life and I've seen so much. And you cure me every <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> love." [...] The dedication-like lyrics begins with the singer comparing her music as an escape route for her fans. This is expanded upon in the chorus when Gaga belts [...] "If I can't find the cure, I'll, I'll fix you with my love", thus positioning herself as someone who advocates for the troubling time in anyone's life, evident by the closing line [...] "Promise I'll always be there, Promise I'll be the cure". Ally Hirschalg from Mic also found other explanations from the lyrics: a mother talking to her children and someone who had a recent break-up, the latter alluding to Gaga's break-up with fiancee Taylor Kinney the previous year.|$|E

[...] The couple had one son, Edward Fleming Sheffey, (1865–1933), who became a successful Lynchburg businessman.

40|$|When couples {{divorce and}} a single-parent family is formed, {{children}} face many {{changes in their}} family life.
