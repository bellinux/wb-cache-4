5|$|At {{first the}} most prestigious reviewers ignored the book, leaving it to book trade and library {{publications}} such as Kirkus Reviews and Booklist, which examined it only by the entertainment-oriented criteria of children's fiction. However, more penetrating specialist reviews (such as one by Cooperative Children's Book Center Choices, which pointed out the complexity, depth and consistency of the world Rowling had built) {{attracted the attention of}} reviewers in major newspapers. Although The Boston Globe and Michael Winerip in The New York Times complained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> chapters were the weakest part of the book, they and most other American reviewers gave glowing praise.|$|E
5|$|Casualties were {{estimated}} to be between 2 and 3 million (about a quarter to one-third of the total population), while the Jewish population of Belarus was devastated during the Holocaust and never recovered. The population of Belarus did not regain its pre-war level until 1971. It was also after this conflict <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> borders of Belarus were set by Stalin when parts of Belarusian territory {{were given to the}} recently annexed Lithuania.|$|E

5|$|Columbia Pictures gave Spider-Man 3 a US {{release on}} May 4, 2007. The film begins with Peter Parker basking in his success as Spider-Man before an {{extraterrestrial}} symbiote takes control of him. Peter must then battle a rival photographer that the symbiote then takes control of (Topher Grace) and the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church). The general consensus among critics was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> installment {{was not as}} refined as the first two entries, with it being criticized for its excessive use of villains, romantic conflicts and weak plot points. Nonetheless, Spider-Man 3 surpassed the previous two films' openings, making $151 million at over 4,250 locations.|$|E
5|$|Donal {{meanwhile}} {{turns to}} alcohol, devastated {{at the fact}} that he has brought about a god who, according to Donal's religion, should not even exist.

5|$|Estimates of {{the numbers}} killed, wounded, and taken captive during this time vary widely. Ian Steele has {{compiled}} estimates ranging from 200 to 1,500.

5|$|In {{regards to}} the English dub, Shinkai {{did not feel that}} he could judge the quality of the voice acting since he could not speak English natively. He felt that it was good due to the {{feedback}} he had received and because he could feel the emotion in the characters' voices. However, he noted that the experience would be different for viewers and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences.|$|E

5|$|Industry representatives complained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> rule overstated the {{environmental}} effects of corn ethanol, and also criticized the inclusion of ILUC as an unfair penalty to domestic corn ethanol because deforestation {{in the developing world}} was being tied to U.S. ethanol production. The 2011 limit for LCFS means that Mid-west corn ethanol failed, unless current carbon intensity was reduced. Oil industry representatives complained that the standard left oil refiners with few options, such as Brazilian sugarcane ethanol, with its accompanying tariff. CARB officials and environmentalists counter that time and economic incentives will allow produces to adapt.|$|E
5|$|Martin {{believes}} {{the last two}} volumes of the series will be big books of 1500 manuscript pages each. The sixth book will be called The Winds of Winter, taking {{the title of the}} last book of the originally planned trilogy. Displeased with the provisional title A Time for Wolves for the final volume, Martin ultimately announced A Dream of Spring as the title for the seventh book in 2006. Martin said in March 2012 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> two novels will take readers farther north than any of the previous books, and that the Others will appear in the book.|$|E
5|$|Most reviews {{were very}} favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, {{although}} a few complained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> chapters seemed rushed. The writing {{has been compared to}} that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors, Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter, and the Ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues.|$|E

5|$|Reviews of {{the book}} were mostly positive, with most reviewers commenting that the book was well {{researched}} and provided a solid history of the show.

Flapless surgery is an alternate technique, where a small punch of tissue (the diameter of the implant) is removed for implant placement rather than raising flaps.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{position}} that the Baltic states had been forcibly annexed would remain its official stance for the following 51 years. Subsequent U.S. presidents and Congressional resolutions reaffirmed {{the substance of the}} Declaration. President Dwight D.

After confirming the Helsinki Final Act in July 1975, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Final</b> Act would not affect the continuity of U.S. recognition of the sovereignty of Baltic states.|$|E

5|$|The {{match was}} Hibs' 12th {{appearance}} in the Scottish Cup final and Hearts' 14th. Hibs had previously won two finals and Hearts had won seven. Because both teams were from Edinburgh, {{many of the city}} councillors requested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> be held in Edinburgh at Murrayfield Stadium, instead of the traditional venue of Hampden, in Glasgow. The previous final between the two clubs in 1896 had been held in Edinburgh but on this occasion it stayed in Glasgow.|$|E
5|$|The program's {{scheduled}} broadcast {{time was}} 21:00, but the channel often delayed its broadcast {{by up to}} 40 minutes.
