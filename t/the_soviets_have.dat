2500|$|Stalin {{also tried}} to {{maximise}} Soviet influence on the world stage, unsuccessfully pushing for Libya—recently liberated from Italian occupation—to become a Soviet protectorate. He sent Molotov as his representative to San Francisco {{to take part in}} negotiations to form the United Nations, insisting that <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>have</b> a place on the Security Council. In April 1949, the Western powers established the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), an international military alliance of capitalist countries. Within Western countries, Stalin was increasingly portrayed as the [...] "most evil dictator alive" [...] and compared to Hitler.|$|E
2500|$|T-72M1 (Ob'yekt 172M-E5): this export {{version of}} the T-72A was also built under licence in Poland since 1983. The most obvious {{external}} difference relative to Soviet analogs is the reduced number of KMT mounting points on the lower hull glacis plate. This is the 1st version to feature ceramic sand bars [...] "kwartz" [...] rods in the turret cavity and [...] High Hardness Steel appliqué armor on upper glacis. The reason for introduction of T-72M1 with improved glacis and ceramic turret armor so soon after T-72M was put into production {{was the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>have</b> learned in 1982 from the captured Israeli tank, that under certain condition the newest M111 [...] "Hetz" [...] 105mm APFSDS Ammunition could penetrate Soviet standard T-72A upper glacis armor but not the turret.|$|E
2500|$|Bougainville and her grandson, Lee Tong, {{have entered}} into an audacious plan with the Soviet Union to {{engineer}} {{the kidnapping of}} the President of the United States, the Vice President, the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate, the next three men {{in the line of}} succession to the presidency, as part of a project code-named Huckleberry Finn. [...] It is revealed that the Soviet economy is in ruins, a famine is spreading amongst the Eastern Bloc nations and the whole Eastern Bloc may {{be on the verge of}} collapse. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>have</b> devised a plan that calls for the President to undergo a top-secret Soviet mind control procedure, termed [...] "mind intervention", which uses a combination of an implanted microchip and injected memories from a brainwashed Soviet dissident to allow the Soviet government to control the President's thoughts without his knowledge. [...] The other three men are kept in reserve as the procedure only has about a 60% success rate. [...] In return for carrying out the abduction, the Bougainvilles are to receive one billion dollars in gold, which the Soviets intend to cheat them out of while unaware that the Bougainvilles intend to double-cross them as well.|$|E

5000|$|The U.S. did not {{understand}} that Israel saw <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union as its number one threat; that even before he became President Nixon’s National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger had told Israeli leaders that the U.S. would not help Israel if <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> attacked it; that Israeli missiles targeted <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union from 1971 on; that <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> added four Israeli cities to their target list; that <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> threatened Israel after the 1973 war because Israel kept breaking ceasefires with Egypt.|$|R

25|$|Germany delayed its {{delivery}} of the cruiser Lützow and {{the plans for the}} Bismarck as long as possible, hoping to avoid delivery altogether if the war developed favorably. The incomplete Lützow was towed to Leningrad in mid-1940 in a less complete state than <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> anticipated. In response to later Soviet orders, Germany did deliver eight 38.1cm guns and six 40cm guns for which <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> requested drawings. <b>The</b> Lützow, which was not yet completed, was towed to Leningrad, where German engineers worked on the vessel until June 22, 1941.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} years of World War II, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> planned on {{building}} a huge navy {{to catch up with the}} Western World. However, the German invasion of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in June 1941 forced the suspension of this plan: <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> to divert most of their resources to fighting the Germans - primarily on land - throughout most of the war, leaving their navy relatively poorly equipped. As a result, in Project Hula (1945), the United States transferred about 100 naval vessels (out of 180 planned) to <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in preparation for <b>the</b> planned <b>Soviet</b> entry into <b>the</b> war against Japan.

5000|$|Three days later, a Guardian article quotes NATO Secretary General Manfred Wörner {{as saying}} that <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>have</b> come close to {{accepting}} NATO’s doctrine of military stability based on a mix of nuclear as well as conventional arms.

50|$|Under {{conditions}} of absolute secrecy, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>have</b> developed a miniaturization technology that can reduce a human to {{the dimensions of}} a molecule, or smaller. However, the process requires an enormous input of energy to miniaturize even a small object for a short time.

50|$|In Asia, in {{addition}} to overrunning Manchuria, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> annexed Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands, which were promised {{to them in the}} Tehran and Yalta conferences. <b>The</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> also taken Korea from the Japanese and occupied it above the 38th parallel north.

After the Red Army withdrawal from Manchuria, the Chinese Civil War would extend into that region.
