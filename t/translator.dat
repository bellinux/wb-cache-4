25|$|Especially in fansubs, the {{subtitle}} <b>translator</b> may translate both form and meaning. The subtitle <b>translator</b> may also choose {{to display a}} note in {{the subtitle}}s, usually in parentheses (“” and “”), or as a separate block of on-screen text—this allows the subtitle <b>translator</b> to preserve form and achieve an acceptable reading speed; that is, the subtitle <b>translator</b> may leave {{a note on the}} screen, even after the character has finished speaking, to both preserve form and facilitate understanding. For example, the Japanese language has multiple first-person pronouns (see Japanese pronouns) and each pronoun is associated with a different degree of politeness. In order to compensate during the English translation process, the subtitle <b>translator</b> may reformulate the sentence, add appropriate words and/or use notes.|$|E
