50|$|Cluttering (also called <b>tachyphemia</b> or tachyphrasia) is {{a speech}} and {{communication}} disorder {{characterized by a}} rapid rate of speech, erratic rhythm, and poor syntax or grammar, making speech difficult to understand.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s, cluttering {{was called}} <b>tachyphemia,</b> a word {{derived from the}} Greek for [...] "fast speech." [...] This word is no longer used to {{describe}} cluttering because fast speech is not a required element of cluttering.|$|E
50|$|Bakwin and {{his wife}} co-authored an early piece on the speech {{disorder}} cluttering (also called <b>tachyphemia)</b> in 1952, years before cluttering was commonly discussed. Bakwin observed that clutterers could temporarily overcome their speech defect {{when they tried to}} do so.|$|E
40|$|Stuttering {{is a type}} of supra-segmental {{structure}} speech disorder. Supra-segmental {{structure of}} speech is consisted of quantitative features as: flu­ency, rhythm, duration, intensity, voice power, word accentuation and melodic expression. Stut­tering is manifested as disordered fluency. Physio­lo­gical fluency is characterized by five time-di­men­­sions. First dimension is sequence. Sounds have specific sequence in words. Sounds order determines word meaning. Some sounds in reverse word- order have different meaning. Second dimension is duration. Every speech mani­festation or even a word has its own duration. Du­ration deficiency may cause problems in under­standing speech, and only because of the differen­tial sign accentuation and duration own. Third dimension is speed. Speed measures the pro­nunciation of phonetic elements and words. Too slow or too fast pronunciation influences under­standing speech (such is the case of <b>tachyphemia).</b> Fourth dimension is rhythm. It presents the way of speaking process. If the speech is too fast, tensed, interrupted, not equable then it is difficult for lis­tening to and even tiresome. Fifth dimension is fluency, which is realized by flowing sounds and words into sentences...|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: caracterizar a população de indivíduos atendidos na Clínica de Distúrbios da Fluência do Curso de Fonoaudiologia da USP (Bauru), de 1992 a 2005, quanto à idade, gênero, queixa inicial, diagnóstico fonoaudiológico, antecedentes familiares, manifestações, gravidade e frequência, além de possíveis alterações associadas, comparando tais dados com a {{literatura}} estudada. MÉTODOS: análise de 194 prontuários da população acima referida por meio do preenchimento de protocolo com questões referentes às variáveis propostas no objetivo. RESULTADOS: dos 194 prontuários, 140 pertenciam a pacientes do sexo masculino (72 % da amostra) e 54 (28 %), do feminino. Entre as queixas relatadas, 68 % (n= 132) eram de gagueira, 23 % (n= 45) referiam-se a outros distúrbios da fluência (taquifemia, distúrbio motor da fala) e outras 9 % (n= 17) estavam associadas a alterações vocais, linguagem oral e/ou escrita e fala. Quanto a antecedentes familiares, 57 % (n= 110) tinham na família mais de um parente com alterações na fala e/ou linguagem. As manifestações das disfluências, citadas em 54 % dos prontuários (n= 105) dos indivíduos diagnosticados com gagueira, foram bloqueios, repetições e prolongamentos. Constatou-se histórico de atraso de linguagem nos casos de gagueira em 31 % dos casos (n= 60). CONCLUSÃO: com base nos dados encontrados, conclui-se que a população estudada caracteriza-se por apresentar: início dos primeiros sintomas entre 1 e 5 anos, maior acometimento no gênero masculino, histórico familiar e de atraso de fala e linguagem positivo, manifestações predominantes de repetição de sílabas, bloqueios, bloqueios acompanhados de prolongamentos e hesitações. PURPOSE: {{to characterize}} the population of subjects with fluency disorders as for age, gender, initial complaint, speech therapy diagnosis, family history, manifestations, degree of severity and frequency of disfluency and possible associated alterations, comparing the data to literature. METHODS: analysis of 194 medical records of individuals with fluency disorders at the Speech Language Pathology and Audiology Clinic at USP (Bauru Campus), through a protocol containing questions related to the items proposed in the objective. RESULTS: from the 194 medical records, 140 were male (72 % of the sample) and 54 (28 %) female; among the reported complaints, 68 % (132 medical records) were about stuttering, 23 % (n= 45) regarding other fluency disorders (<b>tachyphemia,</b> motor speech disorders, etc) and others 9 % (n= 17) had associated complaints (vocal alterations, oral and/or written language and speech). With regard to family history, 57 % (n= 110) {{had more than one}} relative in their family with speech and/or language alterations. The manifestations of disfluency cited in 54 % of the medical records (n= 105) from subjects diagnosed with stuttering were blocks, repetitions and prolongations. A history of language retardation was ascertained in cases of stuttering in 31 % of the cases (60 medical records), which, together with the other symptoms described in literature, should be taken into consideration when carrying out an early diagnosis. CONCLUSION: based on the found data, we concluded that the studied population is characterized for showing the following: the beginning of the first symptoms between 1 and 5 -year old, greater involvement of males, a positive family history and late speech and language;, disfluency manifestation found were repetition of syllables, block, block accompanied by extensions and hesitations...|$|E
