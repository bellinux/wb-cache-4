Additional blocking agents were found such as <b>tolazoline</b> in Switzerland and phenoxybenzamine in the United States, but like the ergot alkaloids they blocked only the smooth muscle excitatory receptors. Additional agonists also were synthesized. Outstanding among them became isoprenaline, N-isopropyl-noradrenaline, of Boehringer Ingelheim, studied pharmacologically along with adrenaline and other N-substituted noradrenaline derivatives by Richard Rössler (1897–1945) and Heribert Konzett (1912–2004) in Vienna. The Viennese pharmacologists used their own Konzett-Rössler test to examine bronchodilation. Intravenous injection of pilocarpine to induce bronchospasm was followed by intravenous injection of the agonists. “Arrangement of all amines according to their bronchodilator effect yields a series from the most potent, isopropyl-adrenaline, via the approximately equipotent bodies adrenaline, propyl-adrenaline and butyl-adrenaline, to the weakly active isobutyl-adrenaline.” Isoprenaline also exerted marked positive chronotropic and inotropic effects. Boehringer introduced it for use in asthma in 1940. After the war it became available to Germany’s former enemies {{and over the years}} was traded under about 50 names. In addition to this therapeutic success {{it was one of the}} agonists with which Raymond P. Ahlquist solved the ″myoneural junction″ riddle. “By virtue of this property the reputation of the substance spread all over the world and it became a tool for many investigations on different aspects of pharmacology and therapeutics.” The story had a dark side: overdosage caused numerous deaths due to cardiac side effects, an estaimated three thousands in the United Kingdom alone.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{commonly}} used in cryopreservation of blood vessels {{along with the other}} glycosaminoglycans and protein suspensions. Functions as a vasodilator during cryopreservation when used in conjunction with verapamil, phentolamine, nifedipine, <b>tolazoline</b> or nitroprusside.|$|E
50|$|Ahlquist's other {{scientific}} work {{also includes the}} pharmacology of the sympathetic nervous system.

It was discovered with his help that the peristalsis is enhanced by α-adrenoceptors and conversely inhibited by β-adrenoceptors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tolazoline</b> is a non-selective {{competitive}} α-adrenergic receptor antagonist. It is a vasodilator {{that is used}} {{to treat}} spasms of peripheral blood vessels (as in acrocyanosis). It has also been used (in conjunction with sodium nitroprusside) successfully as an antidote to reverse the severe peripheral vasoconstriction which can occur as a result of overdose with certain 5-HT2A agonist drugs such as 25I-NBOMe, DOB and Bromodragonfly (prolonged severe vasoconstriction can lead to gangrene if untreated).|$|E
50|$|Vasoconstrictive action {{resulting}} from severe overdose of Bromo-DragonFLY {{is known to}} have caused tissue necrosis of the extremities in at least one case. In September 2007, a 35-year-old Swedish male required amputation of the front part of his feet and several fingers on one hand after taking a massive (but unknown) overdose; reportedly, the compound acted as a long-acting efficacious vasoconstrictor, leading to necrosis and gangrene which became apparent several weeks after the overdose occurred. Treatment was of limited efficacy in this case, although <b>tolazoline</b> is reportedly an effective treatment where available.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{drugs have}} been used as {{supportive}} therapeutic intervention such as lidocaine, naloxone, thiamine, lorazepam, vecuronium, etomidate, propofol, <b>tolazoline,</b> yohimbine, atropine, naloxone, orciprenaline, metoclopramide, ranitidine, metoprolol, enoxaparin, flucloxacillin, insulin, and irrigation of both eyes with saline. Effects of xylazine are also reversed by the analeptics 4-aminopyridine, doxapram, and caffeine, which are physiological antagonists to central nervous system depressants. Combining yohimbine and 4-aminopyridine in an effort to antagonize xylazine is superior as compared to the administration of either of these drugs individually due to reduction of recovery time. Research initiatives may be necessary in order to standardize treatment and determine effective measures for identifying chronic xylazine usage and intoxication.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tolazoline,</b> a drug {{used in the}} {{treatment}} of hypertension, {{has been described as a}} typical H 2 agonist. In this study possible immunomodulating properties of <b>tolazoline</b> were investigated. A single injection of <b>tolazoline</b> 1 day before immunization caused an effect on delayed hypersensitivity that depended on the antigen dose. The response to 10 (5) and 10 (6) sheep red blood cells (SRBC) was decreased, whereas the response to 10 (9) SRBC was enhanced. Administration of <b>tolazoline</b> 4 days after immunization predominantly affected the humoral response. The IgM response was inhibited in favour of the IgG response. Low doses of <b>tolazoline,</b> given to animals simultaneously with the elicitation for delayed hypersensitivity, lead to a more severe inflammation. The possible involvement of suppressor cells and vessels in <b>tolazoline</b> action is discussed. The application of <b>tolazoline</b> in the immunotherapy of human cancer is suggested...|$|E
40|$|In cats {{treated with}} {{reserpine}} and anaesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium the adrenergic blocking drug, <b>tolazoline,</b> caused {{a rise of}} arterial pressure which was inhibited by previous administration of phenoxybenzamine. <b>Tolazoline</b> increased the contractions of the isolated papillary muscles of normal cats but not of cats treated with reserpine. Intra-arterial injection of <b>tolazoline</b> into dogs treated with reserpine and anaesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium reduced the blood flow in the coeliac artery.

40|$|<b>Tolazoline</b> (2 -benzyl- 2 -imidazoline) {{activated}} {{adenylate cyclase}} in pig epidermal slices {{resulting in the}} accumulation of cyclic AMP. This effect was highly potentiated {{by the addition of}} the cyclic AMP-phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline. Specific histamine (H 2) receptor inhibitors (metiamide and cimetidine) completely blocked the <b>tolazoline</b> activation of adenylate cyclase. At low concentrations (10 – 100 μM), a histamine (H 1) receptor inhibitor (diphenhydramine) and a β-adrenergic blocker (propranolol) did not inhibit this effect. The stimulation of cyclic AMP formation by the combination of <b>tolazoline</b> and histamine was about the same as the stimulation by histamine alone (nonadditive), whereas the stimulatory effects by <b>tolazoline</b> and epinephrine were additive. These data suggest that <b>tolazoline,</b> an β-adrenergic blocker, also activates adenylate cyclase at the histamine (H 2) receptor site which is distinct from the β-adrenergic receptor site. Another α-adrenergic blocker, phentolamine, did not have this effect...|$|E
40|$|The haemodynamic {{effects of}} {{infusion}} of epoprostenol (prostacyclin) and bolus injection of <b>tolazoline</b> were compared in a crossover study in 11 children with pulmonary hypertension caused by pulmonary vascular disease. The children were studied during cardiac catheterisation, {{while they were}} anaesthetised, paralysed, and ventilated with 100 % oxygen. The order of drug administration was not randomised because <b>tolazoline</b> has a half life of hours whereas epoprostenol has a half life of a few minutes. Both drugs caused pulmonary and systemic vasodilatation, {{and there were no}} significant differences between the two. The 95 % confidence intervals suggest that <b>tolazoline</b> did not have a clinically important haemodynamic advantage over epoprostenol. Previous reports suggest that serious side effects are common when <b>tolazoline</b> is used in repeated doses; epoprostenol has only a few minor side effects that are rapidly reversible when the infusion is stopped. Epoprostenol is more expensive than <b>tolazoline</b> but this study suggests that epoprostenol is a more suitable pulmonary vasodilator if more than a single dose is required...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The {{cardiovascular}} {{effects of}} ranitidine were studied in 12 children with {{congenital heart disease}} who had been given <b>tolazoline</b> as a pulmonary vasodilator. Ranitidine was given as prophylaxis against gastrointestinal haemorrhage induced by <b>tolazoline.</b> <b>Tolazoline</b> 1 - 2 mg/kg caused significant falls in pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances and a rise in heart rate. After intravenous administration of ranitidine. 3 mg/kg both resistances rose again and neither resistance then differed significantly from baseline levels. Heart rate also fell and the final heart rate was significantly below baseline levels. We conclude {{that there may be}} H 2 receptors within the pulmonary and systemic circulations and that <b>tolazoline</b> may mediate some of its effects through these H 2 receptors rather than by alpha adrenergic receptor blockade. The safety of H 2 blockade in children, particularly those with pulmonary hypertension, needs further investiga-tion. <b>Tolazoline</b> is an alpha adrenergic blocking agent that has been widely used as a pulmonary vasodila-tor, particularly in babies and small children. - 3 Indications for its use include preoperative assess...|$|E
40|$|The alpha-adrenoceptor {{blocking}} agent, <b>tolazoline,</b> and the O-methylated metabolite of adrenaline, metanephrine, {{produced a}} concentration-dependent increase of {{tension in the}} smooth muscle of the cat isolated nictitating membrane.

40|$|The {{intravenous}} injection {{of a standard}} dose (0. 05 mg/kg) of xylazine inhibited reticuloruminal motility in cattle. Pretreatment with adrenoceptor antagonists showing alpha 2 -blocking activity, <b>tolazoline</b> (0. 5 mg/kg) and yohimbine (0. 2 mg/kg), antagonized the xylazine-induced reticuloruminal amotility. <b>Tolazoline</b> was more effective than yohimbine, since an antagonistic effect was not seen at 0. 5 mg/kg yohimbine, and yohimbine at 0. 2 mg/kg was less effective than <b>tolazoline</b> at 0. 5 mg/kg. An adrenoceptor antagonist showing alpha 1 -blocking activity, prazosin, did not prevent the inhibition of reticuloruminal motility by xylazine. The xylazine-induced reticuloruminal amotility was also not prevented by either a dopamine receptor antagonist, domperidone, or an opiate receptor antagonist, naloxone. These results suggest that xylazine inhibits bovine reticuloruminal motility through its activation of alpha 2 -adrenoceptors, and show that <b>tolazoline</b> {{can be used as}} a specific antagonist of xylazine in studies of the alpha-adrenergic influence on reticuloruminal motility in cattle...|$|E
40|$|Dose-response curves for clonidine-produced {{analgesia}} in rats {{were constructed}} using the tail-flick and formalin tests. Subsequently, the relative role of alpha 1 and alpha 2 receptors in clonidine analgesia {{in each of}} these tests was determined using systemic administration of vehicle controls, <b>tolazoline,</b> yohimbine and prazosin prior to injection of an ED 50 dose of clonidine. Clonidine was found to be significantly more potent in the formalin test than in the tail-flick test. Furthermore, clonidine analgesia in the tail-flick test was completely antagonized by <b>tolazoline</b> and yohimbine, but not by prazosin, whereas clonidine was antagonized by <b>tolazoline</b> and prazosin, but not by yohimbine in the formalin test.

40|$|After {{repair of}} a Bochdalek diaphragmatic hernia, {{shunting}} of blood {{away from the}} lungs produced progressive hypoxaemia in a neonate. Changes in plasma concentrations of the vasoconstrictor prostanoid thromboxane were associated with changes in pulmonary vascular resistance in this infant. Plasma concentrations of the vasodilator prostanoid prostacyclin were also monitored during acute changes in pulmonary vascular resistance. <b>Tolazoline</b> administration was followed by reductions in pulmonary vascular resistance and in plasma thromboxane and prostacyclin values. Further studies indicated that <b>tolazoline</b> inhibits platelet thromboxane synthesis and vascular prostacyclin synthesis. These data suggest that thromboxane plays {{a part in the}} increased pulmonary vascular resistance that occurs after repair of congenital diaphragmatic hernia and that <b>tolazoline</b> may reverse pulmonary hypertension by a mechanism additional to its known action as an alpha adrenergic blocking agent and its effect on histamine release...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tolazoline</b> {{hydrochloride}} {{was given}} as a pulmonary vasodilator to 20 preterm infants with severe hyaline membrane disease {{requiring mechanical ventilation}} who developed persistent severe hypoxaemia. The drug was only given when deterioration persisted despite changes in ventilation techniques and thus there were no control infants. A significant improvement in arterial oxygenation was observed, particularly in those infants without intracranial haemorrhage or pneumothroax. Nine of 10 infants who had an obvious clinical response to <b>tolazoline</b> survived, whereas only 2 survived out of 10 who failed to respond, both being subsequently shown to have pneumothoraces. There {{appears to be a}} place for the use of <b>tolazoline</b> in a severely hypoxaemic infant with hyaline membrane disease who is being ventilated and in whom arterial oxygenation cannot be improved by further increase in the inspired oxygen concentration or by alteration of ventilator settings, provided pneumothorax has been excluded...|$|E

40|$|Modulation of delayed {{hypersensitivity}} and antibody formation to sheep red cells by metiamide were {{studied in the}} mouse system. Depending on the time and dose of antigen and metiamide administration suppression or enhancement of the {{delayed hypersensitivity}} response was observed. The effects in this system {{did not differ from}} those reported for the H 2 agonist <b>tolazoline,</b> which were most probably mediated by suppressor cells. As far as the humoral response was concerned metiamide tended to stimulate the IgM response. Optimal stimulation was reached if 50 mg metiamide/kg was administered 3 days before immunization with 2 × 108 SRBC. Under all conditions tested the IgG response was unaffected. These results suggest antagonistic effects of metiamide for <b>tolazoline</b> and adduce further evidence for the presence of H 2 receptors on B cells. The IgM production per plasmacell was enhanced suggesting different H 2 receptors to be involved in differentiative and proliferative B cell responses. The possible consequences of H 2 antagonist application in human therapy are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Comparisons {{have been}} made between the effects of {{autonomic}} dysfunction and the pathophysiological changes in the exocrine secretions from patients with cystic fibrosis (Roberts, 1959). Cotton (1966) found that administration of <b>tolazoline</b> hydrochloride (an alpha-adrenergic blocker) to patients with cor pulmonale in the terminal stages of cystic fibrosis was associated with an improvement in {{the results of their}} lung function tests. This effect might have been due to an alteration of the abnormal viscosity of the bronchial mucus mediated via the autonomic nervous system, thus permitting easier expectoration. Measurement, by means of a Ferranti-Shirely cone and plate viscometer, of several different aspects of sputum viscosity is described. <b>Tolazoline</b> hydrochloride, administered to five patients with cystic fibrosis, was shown not to differ significantly from a placebo in its effect on sputum viscosity and dynamic lung volumes.

40|$|The {{adrenergic}} blockade {{and particularly}} the direct peripheral vasodilatation produced by <b>tolazoline</b> (Priscoline, 2 -benzyl- 2 -imidazoline) have led to its clinical use {{in a variety of}} peripheral vascular diseases. However, this agent lacks specificity and has been shown to have also sympathomimetic, parasympatho-mimetic and histamine-like actions on many different tissues and organs (see Nickerson, 1949). These actions are responsible for the side effects frequently noted following its administration. During the course of experiments designed for another purpose, the intravenous administration of <b>tolazoline</b> was noted to induce cardiac arrhythmias and signs of central nervous system stimulation. The studies reported below were under-taken to define more clearly the characteristics of this cardiac action and to evaluate the significance of the central nervous system stimulation, an action of this agent not previously reported.

In view of the funda-mental difference in responses obtained in the skin and muscle vascular beds, experimental studies were designed to determine and compare the response to sympathetic nerve stimulation in the skin and muscle vascular beds. These studies also compared the blockade produced by the adrenergic blocking drug, Dibenzyline, with the previously studied blocking drugs, <b>tolazoline,</b> phen-tolamine, and Ilidar, on graduated doses of l-epinephrine, l-norepinephrine and sympathetic nerve stimulation.

40|$|Subcutaneous {{administration}} of the alpha(sub 2) -adrenoreceptor antagonists, yohimbine and <b>tolazoline,</b> at doses up to 1000 micro-g/kg, {{had no effect on}} water intake of female rats. However, when these compounds were administered SC in combination with either the beta-adrenoreceptor agonist, isoproterenol (10 to 25 micro-g/kg, SC), or with angiotensin 2 (200 micro-g/kg, SC). water intake was enhanced. In contrast, intraventricular {{administration of}} either <b>tolazoline</b> (10 and 20 micro-g/kg) or yohimbine (300 micro-g/kg) failed to augment the dipsogenic response to angiotensin 2 (150 micro-g/kg, SC). Thus, the enhancing effect of these alpha(sub 2) -adrenoreceptor antagonists on isoproterenol- and angiotensin 2 -induced water intakes appears to be manifested peripherally, rather than centrally. In {{view of the fact that}} clonidine, an alpha(sub 2) -adrenoreceptor agonist, has been shown to inhibit water intake induced by both isoproterenol and angiotensin 2, the results suggest that the alpha(sub 2) -adrenoreceptor may play a role in modulating water intake induced by these two dipsogenic agents...|$|E

All the extracts and infusion relaxed the ileum dose-dependently. Their effects were blocked by <b>tolazoline,</b> indicating that α–adrenergic receptors were involved. MCSL contracted the colon dose-dependently and was blocked by atropine(1. 7 x 10 - 8 M) and nifedipine (2. 8 x 10 - 10 M).
