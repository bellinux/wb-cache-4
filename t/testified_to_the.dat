Voorhees opposed the adjournment and moved for Jackalow's immediate release {{on the ground that}} there was no jurisdiction because no crime had been proved to have been committed. Jeliffe replied that he intended to charge murder, piracy, and running away with a vessel with intent to steal it. Vroom granted an adjournment until Tuesday at 11am. Jackalow was remanded to the city prison.|$|E
5|$|The FCI {{refused to}} suspend Petacchi, and he {{returned}} to racing in late July. Their decision, however, was not made to exonerate Petacchi, but rather {{because they did not}} believe they should hear the case, instead deferring to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The CAS heard the case, and Petacchi <b>testified</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> court, stating that the hot and humid day on which the stage was the run had made it so that he took several extra puffs from his inhaler, but that this was accidental and that most had come after he had already crossed the finish line and won the stage.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} witnesses, {{including}} Hannah Cox, <b>testified</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{events of the}} evening of 26 May and of the following morning. The first witnesses to attract significant cross-examination by William Reader, Thornton's barrister, were the two factory workers, William Lavell and Joseph Bird, who had matched Thornton's shoes to the footprints in the harrowed field. Under cross-examination, both admitted that it had rained heavily between the time the footprints were made and the time they attempted to match the prints. Constable Dales told the jury that Thornton admitted having sex with Ashford before he was searched: that is, before his bloodstained clothing came to light. Mr Freer, a Birmingham surgeon who conducted the post-mortem, testified as to its results, and stated that except for the vaginal lacerations, {{there were no signs}} of violence on Ashford's person, and that those cuts could have been caused by consensual sexual relations. Freer's testimony concluded the prosecution case, and as the defendant declined to exercise his right to himself make a statement to the court, the defence began calling witnesses.|$|E

Durand de Huesca, responding to a Cathar tract c.1220 indicates that they regarded the physical world as the creation of Satan. A former Italian Cathar turned Dominican, Sacchoni in 1250 <b>testified</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Inquisition that his former co-religionists believed that the devil made the world and everything in it.|$|E
