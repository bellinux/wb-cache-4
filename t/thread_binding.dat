40|$|Abstract—While modern CPUs {{offer an}} {{increasing}} number of cores with shared caches, prevailing execution engines for business processes, workflows, or Web service compositions have not been optimized for properly exploiting the abundant processing resources of such CPUs. One factor limiting performance is the inefficient thread scheduling by the operating system, which can result in suboptimal use of shared caches. In this paper we study performance of the JOpera business process execution engine on a recent multicore machine. By analyzing the engine’s architecture and by <b>binding</b> <b>threads</b> that are likely to access shared data to cores with a common cache, we achieve speedups up to 13 % for a variety of workloads, without modifying the engine’s architecture and implementation, apart from <b>binding</b> <b>threads</b> to CPUs. As the engine is implemented in Java, we provide a new Java library to manage <b>thread</b> <b>bindings</b> and hardware performance counters. We also leverage hardware performance counters to explain the observed speedup in our performance analysis.

By re-examining the traumatic legacies of the century’s three major conflicts, the volume illuminates a number of recurrent yet differentiated ideas concerning memorialisation, mythologisation, mobilisation, commemoration and confrontation, reconstruction and representation in the aftermath of conflict. The post-conflict relationship between the living and the dead, the contestation of memories and legacies of war in cultural and political discourses, and the significance of generations are key <b>threads</b> <b>binding</b> the collection together. While not claiming to be the definitive study of so vast a subject, the collection nevertheless presents a series of enlightening historical and cultural perspectives from leading scholars in the field, and it pushes back the boundaries of the burgeoning field of the study of legacies and memories of war. Bringing together historians, literary scholars, political scientists and cultural studies experts to discuss the legacies and memories of war in Europe (1918 - 1945 - 1989), the collection makes an important contribution to the ongoing interdisciplinary conversation regarding the interwoven legacies of twentieth-century Europe’s three major conflicts...|$|R

In the complex two drug molecules are bound per duplex with full retention of the dyad symmetry. Arugomycin adopts a <b>threaded</b> <b>binding</b> orientation with chains of sugars positioned in both the major and minor groove of the helix simultaneously. The complex is stabilized by hydrogen bonding, electrostatic and van der Waals interactions principally in the major groove and involving substituents on the rigidly oriented bicycloamino-glucose sugar of the antibiotic. A specific hydrogen bond is identified between the C 2 '-hydroxyl and the guanine N 7 at the intercalation site. Together, interactions in the major groove appear {{to account for the}} intercalation specificity of arugomycin that requires both a guanine and thymine at the intercalation site. We are unable to identify any sequence specific interactions between the minor groove and the arugarose sugar (S 1) which binds only weakly, through van der Walls contacts, over the d(GCA). d(TGC) trinucleotide sequence. The data indicate that the sugar chains of arugomycin are flexible and play little part in the interaction of the antibiotic with DNA. The intensity of sequential internucleotide NOEs identifies the intercalation site as being assymmetric. A family of conformers computed using restrained energy minimisation and molecular dynamics indicate that basepair buckling is a feature of the anthracycline intercalation site that may serve to maximise intermolecular van der Waals interactions by wrapping the basepairs around the antibiotic chromophore...|$|R

We perform a comparison of different data shuffling algorithms and show that a naïve data shuffling algorithm can be up to 3 × slower than the highest performing, NUMAaware one. To achieve the highest performance, we employ a combination of <b>thread</b> <b>binding,</b> NUMA-aware thread allocation, and relaxed global coordination among threads.

40|$|Despite {{the great}} {{progress}} {{in our understanding}} of DNA during the past half-century, there are many important aspects of its chemical and biological role yet to be explored. The principles by which it selectively interacts with other molecules have attracted much interest due to the relevance for fundamental cellular processes, {{as well as for the}} development of diagnostic probes and effective pharmaceutical agents. This Thesis describes the study of the process in which a planar aromatic moiety, hindered by bulky substituents on both ends, is threaded through the DNA double helix. Dumb-bell shaped binuclear ruthenium complexes of the type [µ-(bidppz) (L) 4 Ru 2] 4 +, L = phenanthroline (P) or bipyridine (B) bind upon mixing with DNA rapidly on the outside of the double-helix, after which they rearrange to an intercalated binding mode. Passing one large metal centre between the strands requires large transient distortions of the duplex, leading to extremely slow binding kinetics that is sensitive to DNA sequence as well as ruthenium complex structure. This work has (1) addressed the mechanisms behind this “kinetic recognition” and (2) identified potential DNA structural targets. Both enantiomers of chiral analogues P and B require several hours at 50 °C to rearrange to the <b>threaded</b> <b>binding</b> mode in mixed sequence DNA. Alternating AT polymers, on the other hand, are intercalated within a few minutes at room temperature. The ratio between the forward rates is estimated to vary between 65 (ΛΛ-P) and 2500 (ΛΛ-B). Studies with AT-tract oligonucleotides show that more than one complete helix turn of AT-DNA is required for efficient threading, a stretch considerably larger than the complexes themselves. Long AT-stretches are however not the only kinetically favored targets; subjecting mixed sequence DNA to negative supercoiling can increase the threading rate by as much as two orders of magnitude. Accelerated intercalation is also observed with partially unpaired DNA. Dissociation from mixed sequence DNA displays half-lives of up to 38 h at physiological temperature, the slowest release reported for a reversibly bound agent. The selectivity demonstrated by the binuclear ruthenium complexes in vitro make them interesting in the development of new agents against parasitic protozoa with AT-rich DNA...|$|R
