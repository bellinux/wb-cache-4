40|$|The Analytical Development Section of Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) was {{requested}} by the Facilities Disposition Projects (FDP) to determine the holdup of enriched uranium in the 321 -M facility {{as part of an}} overall deactivation project of the facility. The 321 -M facility was used to fabricate enriched uranium fuel assemblies, lithium-aluminum target tubes, neptunium assemblies, and miscellaneous components for the production reactors. The results of the holdup assays are essential for determining compliance with the Waste Acceptance Criteria, Material Control & Accountability, and to meet criticality safety controls. This report covers holdup measurements on two sawbench components that were used for cutting U-Al fuel rods. <b>The</b> <b>benches</b> contained U-Al residue scattered on <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> <b>tops</b> and bagged up in plastic containers. It was very important to obtain an estimate of the HEU content of this residue in order to remove criticality concerns before vacuuming it into a much smaller volume. A portable high purity germanium (HPGe) detection system and a portable sodium iodide (NaI) detection system were used to determine highly enriched uranium (HEU) holdup and to determine holdup Np- 237 and Am- 241 that were observed in these components. The measured Np- 237 and Am- 241 contents were especially important in these components because their presence is unusual and unexpected in 321 -M. It was important to obtain a measured value of these two components to disposition <b>the</b> saw <b>benches</b> and to determine whether a separate waste stream was necessary for release of these contaminated components to the E-Area Solid Waste Vault. The reported values for Np- 237 are < 0. 8 mg on each of <b>the</b> two <b>bench</b> <b>tops</b> and < 3 {micro}g in the bag of chips. The reported values for Am- 241 are < 500 ng on <b>the</b> two <b>bench</b> <b>tops</b> and < 15 ng in the bag of chips. Our results demonstrate an upper limit of {sup 235 }U content of 0. 4 g on the two benchtops and of 0. 1 mg in the bag of chips. These reported values completely eliminated the criticality concerns.

50|$|The {{first phase}} of the temple (and all {{subsequent}} temples on the site) was orientated on an alignment 30 degrees east of north {{at the foot of the}} western side of a small shallow valley. The building measured 14.6m by 6.55 and is tentatively dated to the third century AD, a period when the fort was occupied by the Cohors I Sunicorum. The shrine consisted of an anteroom (narthex) at the southern end, followed by the temple proper which consisted of a sunken central nave flanked by low benches. This is typical of mithraic temples and enabled the temple to be clearly identified despite no sculptural or epigraphic evidence being found. A rectangular alcove stood at the northern end and would have held the tauroctony. Untrimmed beach boulders were used for the walls, which must have given the structure a rustic look. No trace of the bonding mortar for the stones survived. Several fragments of purple Cambrian slate tiles were found belonging to the roof. The narthex, measuring 1.82m x 5.48m, was almost totally destroyed and no trace of any features survived, including the floor covering. The shrine measured 10.6m x 5.48m with a 2.43m wide niche at the northern end, 45 cm deep. <b>The</b> <b>benches</b> were 1.52m deep and 9.1 meters long.

40|$|Abstract: With {{simulation}} clinics, dental {{schools have}} improved their preclinical laboratories {{to provide a}} more realistic clinical teaching environment. However, there is very little data to support the assumption that these facilities actually improve student performance of technical skills. This study compared the scores of two fixed preparations for full cast crowns by third-year dental students. One of the preparations was made in the simulation clinic manikin, and the other was prepared on <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> <b>top.</b> Three prosthodontic faculty members scored the preparations in the areas of occlusal reduction, axial reduction, resistance and retention, and margination. The study also compared the performance of three classes of dental students: one class with no experience in the simulation clinic, one with one year of experience, and one with two years of experience. The amount of time since completing the fixed prosthodontics course among the students was also evaluated. This was done because the third-year students at the University of Iowa rotate through a series of ten-week clerkships rather than a comprehensive care model. (Therefore, not all students start clinical prosthodontics at the same time.) In addition, all student participants completed a questionnaire that addressed their perception of their clinical readiness prior to treating their first fixed prosthodontic patient. When we compared the classes of years 1, 2, and 3 by average preparation score, we found a significant difference among the scores for teeth prepared on <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> <b>top</b> (p = 0. 0001) but not for the teeth prepared in the mannequin (p = 0. 1176).

40|$|With the fouling layer being {{established}} in most membrane filtration applications, {{a study of}} the possible benefits of the fouling layer was researched. This investigation was aimed at the determination of a viable nitrifying biofilm within the fouling layer of membrane filtration which could oxidize ammonia. The membrane used was a 0. 2 µm ceramic tubular membrane used in cross-flow operation. Nitrifying organisms were inoculated into a bench top filtration apparatus to oxidize ammonia and the corresponding rates of ammonia oxidation were determined in two different operating modes. A "filtering mode" included the process of membrane filtration by enabling filtration and "a non-filtering mode" established the ammonia oxidation rate occurring in the apparatus without the process of filtration. The comparison of the two modes showed {{a significant increase in the}} oxidation rate of the filtering mode. The ammonia oxidation rates seen in the six experimental runs corresponding to the surface of the membrane were: 0. 94, 2. 38, 3. 81, 3. 14, 6. 24, and 9. 30 (mg/l-hr-m 2) compared to the internal surface of <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> <b>top</b> apparatus which were: 0. 12, 0. 12, 0. 12, 0. 11, 0. 20, and 0. 29 (mg/l-hr-m 2) respective to each run.
