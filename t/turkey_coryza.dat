One-day-old turkeys were {{infected}} intranasally with Bordetella avium, and tracheas were examined by scanning and {{transmission electron microscopy}} at 1 to 5 weeks post-inoculation (PI). The predominant ultrastructural lesions were progressive loss of ciliated epithelium with replacement by nonciliated cells, bacterial colonization of ciliated cells, membrane-bound crystalline inclusions in cytoplasm of epithelial cells, depletion of mucous granules, and distortion of tracheal rings and the mucosal surface. Tracheal surface exudates consisted of mucus, necrotic cells, heterophils, and fibrin. Ciliated cells were replaced by immature cuboidal cells char-acterized by abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum with small numbers of electron-dense mucous granules in the apical cytoplasm. Bacterial surfaces were rough and contained numerous pleomorphic, knob-like structures, 20 - 50 nm in diameter. Other changes included enlarged mucosal gland openings, cell extrusion marks, pleo-morphic microvilli, and cells with small numbers of short cilia.

40|$|Bordetella avium is the {{etiologic}} agent of <b>turkey</b> <b>coryza</b> or bordetellosis, a respiratory disease responsible for substantial economic losses to the turkey industry. At present, identification of this bacterium relies on isolation and biochemical testing. Although a PCR {{for the detection}} of B. avium was proposed {{a number of years ago}} (P. H. Savelkoul, L. E. de Groot, C. Boersma, I. Livey, C. J. Duggleby, B. A. van der Zeijst, and W. [*]Gaastra, Microb. Pathog. 15 : 207 - 215, 1993), lack of analytical verification precludes its use as a diagnostic tool. Furthermore, a number of details pertaining to the reaction conditions used are missing or unclear. In the present study we have identified an optimal set of PCR conditions for use with the previously described primer pair and determined the limit of detection under these conditions to be approximately 20 pg. Assay sensitivity is 100 %, based on an analysis of 72 B. avium isolates from diverse geographic locations and covering a time span of at least 25 years. Evaluation of a separate group of 87 bacterial isolates from poultry, comprising both gram-positive and gram-negative commensals and pathogens representing 11 genera, demonstrated an assay specificity of 98. 8 %. Reproducibility is 100 % using either purified genomic DNA or boiled cell lysates less than 3 days old. Sequence analysis of the B. avium PCR amplicons identified only three occasional sequence polymorphisms. These data indicate the B. avium PCR assay can provide clinically significant results...|$|E
