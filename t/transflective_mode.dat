50|$|When an {{illuminance}} sensor {{is added}} {{for control of}} the backlight, such a transflective LCD can be read over a wide range of illuminance levels. This technique is often found in automotive instrumentation. In portable electronic devices the <b>transflective</b> <b>mode</b> of operation helps to save battery charge, since in bright environments no backlighting is required.|$|E
50|$|The company designs {{liquid crystal}} {{displays}} (LCDs) {{that can be}} largely manufactured using the existing manufacturing infrastructure for conventional LCDs. The advantage of Pixel Qi displays over conventional LCDs is mainly {{that they can be}} set to operate under <b>transflective</b> <b>mode</b> and reflective mode, improving eye-comfort, power usage, and visibility under bright ambient light.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{this review}} paper, a {{detailed}} {{overview of the}} trans-flective liquid crystal display (LCD) technology is presented. We first introduce the transflector classifications based on their com-position and properties. Then, in reviewing the development his-tory, we investigate the mainstream transflective LCDs, including their operating principles, advantages, and disadvantages. Finally, the image quality issues of transflective LCDs, such as color bal-ance, image brightness, and viewing angle, are discussed. Index Terms—Reflectance, reflection region, reflective <b>mode,</b> <b>transflective</b> liquid crystal display (LCD), transmission region, transmissive mode, transmittance. I...|$|R
