40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{investigate}} the geographic distribution of <b>the</b> Brazilian <b>industrial</b> <b>sectors</b> over <b>the</b> last three decades. The Gini and Venables Indices are used to measure the concentration. In the latter, the distance between the states is taken into account in measuring this concentration. <b>The</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>sectors</b> are separated into three groups using the K-means method of clustering in which the variables used are the principal components of the characteristics of the industries. By using an internal product, the State Characteristic Bias (SCB), the type of states in which <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>sectors</b> are being concentrated or not can be observed. In order to visualize which characteristics of the states and of the industries-and their respective interactions-influence the location of <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>sectors</b> within Brazil, an econometric cross-section model proposed by Midelfart-Knarvik, et al. (2000) is established for the Brazilian case. The main results show that heavy investment in infrastructure in the 1970 s and the opening of trade in the 1990 s played an important role in the location of Brazilian industry. ...|$|R

5|$|As {{chair of}} Bloomington Conservation Project, Horch and the Master Institute of United Arts led {{an effort to}} improve {{deteriorated}} housing by converting single-family brownstone buildings into rent-subsidized apartments. Efforts like those of this project ameliorated conditions to some extent, but the Bloomingdale area {{did not return to}} prosperity until the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the city as a whole experienced an economic rebound. As high-paying white-collar employment in financial institutions and other service industries replaced long-departed blue-collar jobs in <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>sector,</b> real estate speculators found that they could profit from new condos and co-ops either by replacing old buildings or by renovating them.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the {{predominantly}} mining and agricultural-based economy began a transition towards a more multi-sector economy. Since the 1980s, <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>sector,</b> {{with a high}} level of investment, has led the country's growth. The economy recovered from the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis earlier than neighbouring countries did, and has since recovered to the levels of the pre-crisis era with a GDP per capita of $14,800. Economic inequalities exist between different ethnic groups. The Chinese make up about one-quarter of the population, but accounts for 70 per cent of the country's market capitalisation. Chinese businesses in Malaysia are part of the larger bamboo network, a network of overseas Chinese businesses in the Southeast Asian market sharing common family and cultural ties.|$|E

30|$|Analyzing {{the factors}} {{contributing}} to fluctuations in electricity demand in <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> and commercial <b>sectors</b> reveals that <b>the</b> declining <b>industrial</b> <b>sector</b> growth rate in large metropolitan areas—such as Tokyo, Kansai, and Chubu—results from decreasing production, not increasing electricity rates. By contrast, the commercial sector is experiencing an increasing demand for electricity and significant growth nationwide. Thus, falling electricity rates have a relatively low impact on the demand growth for power in both <b>the</b> commercial and <b>industrial</b> <b>sectors.</b>|$|R

5|$|A strong {{proponent of}} the day fighter force and the defence of Germany, Galland used his {{position}} to improve {{the position of the}} Jagdwaffe. The need was now pressing, as Germany had declared war on the United States on 11 December 1941, and Galland was keen to build up a force that could withstand the resurgence of the Western Allied Air Forces in preparation for what would become known as the Defence of the Reich campaign. Galland was outspoken, something that was not often tolerated by Göring. Yet, by earning and cultivating the support of other powerful personalities in the Luftwaffe, like Erhard Milch and Günther Korten, and personalities in <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>sector</b> such as Albert Speer and even Adolf Hitler, Galland was able to survive in his position for three years.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} phase, {{starting}} in June 2012, {{half of the}} funds from energy and food subsidies will be re-allocated {{to the people and}} the remaining 50% will go to <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>sector.</b> If approved by the Parliament, the government will pay an extra cash handout of 280,000 rials/month to 80% of the general population (i.e. people earning less than $2000/month, which is a comfortable income level in Iran). In July 2012, it was announced that implementation of the second phase was suspended awaiting further adjustments by the government and because of raising inflation (around 22% as of April 2012). Finally, in fall 2013, the parliament approved a plan to drop 22 million Iranians—the top 30 percent of earners—from the subsidy system instead. Yet, it was reported in 2014 that out of Iran’s population of 77 million, 73.6 million registered to receive the cash hand-outs.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Argentina's economy {{continued}} to grow, on average, but {{more slowly than}} {{the world as a}} whole or than its neighbours, Brazil and Chile. A suggested cause is that a multitude of frequently changed regulations, at times extended to ridiculous specifics (such as a 1947 decree setting prices and menus for restaurants), choked economic activity. The long-term effect was to create pervasive disregard for the law, which Argentines came to view as a hindrance to earning a living rather than an aid to enforcing legitimate property rights. The combination of industrial protectionism, redistribution of income from the agrarian to <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>sector,</b> and growing state intervention in the economy sparked an inflationary process. By 1950, Argentina's GDP per capita accounted just nearly half of the United States.|$|E

5|$|The {{growth of}} {{industry}} attracted people {{from within the}} borders of the United States, and from Latin America. By the late 19th century, African Americans were well represented in Youngstown, and the first local congregation of the African Methodist Episcopal Church was established in 1871. In the 1880s, local attorney William R. Stewart was the second African American elected to the Ohio House of Representatives. A large influx of African Americans in the early 20th century owed much to developments in <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>sector.</b> During the national Steel Strike of 1919, local industrialists recruited thousands of workers from the South, many of whom were Black. This move inflamed racist sentiment among local Whites, and for decades, African-American steelworkers experienced discrimination in the workplace. Migration from the South rose dramatically in the 1940s, when the mechanization of southern agriculture brought an end to the exploitative sharecropping system, leading onetime farm laborers to seek industrial jobs.|$|E
5|$|Increasing exports {{during the}} First World War {{led to a}} boom in {{industry}} and declining living standards in the industrial areas, particularly Catalonia and the Basque country. There was high inflation. <b>The</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>sector</b> resented its subjugation by the agrarian central government. Along with concerns about antiquated promotion systems and political corruption, the war in Morocco had caused divisions in the military. Regenerationism became popular, and the working class, industrial class, and the military were united in their hope of removing the corrupt central government. However, these hopes were defeated in 1917 and 1918 when the various political parties representing these groups were either appeased or suppressed by the central government, one by one. The industrialists eventually backed the government {{as a way to}} restore order. After the formation of the Communist International in 1919, there was a growing fear of communism within Spain and growing repression {{on the part of the}} government through military means. The PSOE split, with the more left-wing members founding the Communist Party in 1921. The Restoration government failed to cope with an increasing number of strikes amongst the industrial workers in the north and the agricultural workers in the south.|$|E
