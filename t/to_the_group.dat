5|$|In 2012 thrash metal band Municipal Waste {{formed the}} spinoff group, Iron Reagan. The band's name pays double {{tribute to the}} 1980s with a nod <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> Iron Maiden who enjoyed heavy airplay on MTV during Reagan's presidency.|$|E
30|$|Nine {{animals were}} {{randomized}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> amiodarone <b>group</b> and 9 animals <b>to</b> <b>the</b> control <b>group.</b> Six animals (four randomized <b>to</b> <b>the</b> control <b>group</b> and two <b>to</b> <b>the</b> amiodarone <b>group)</b> died during induction of AMI due to arrhythmia. One animal (randomized <b>to</b> <b>the</b> amiodarone <b>group)</b> died 1  week post-MI (due to surgical wound infection), and one (randomized <b>to</b> <b>the</b> amiodarone <b>group)</b> due <b>to</b> pulmonary edema.

5|$|A {{contrasting}} analysis {{conducted by}} Rauhut and Carrano in 2016 found slightly different relationships within Noasauridae. The specimen CCG 20011 (an as-of-yet unnamed taxon formerly {{referred to the}} tetanuran Chuandongocoelurus), which {{was not included in}} other analyses, was found to be closer to Elaphrosaurus than Limusaurus, with the three taxa representing Elaphrosaurinae. Velocisaurus, Noasaurus and Masiakasaurus were the only taxa within Noasaurinae, as Laevisuchus and Deltadromeus were placed basal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> of Noasaurinae and Elaphrosaurinae within Noasauridae.|$|E
5|$|Algebraic K-theory {{is related}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> of {{invertible}} matrices with coefficients the given field. For example, {{the process of}} taking the determinant of an invertible matrix leads to an isomorphism K1(F) = F. Matsumoto's theorem shows that K2(F) agrees with K2M(F). In higher degrees, K-theory diverges from Milnor K-theory and remains hard to compute in general.|$|E
5|$|Also in September 1997, Biko's family {{established}} the Steve Biko Foundation.

5|$|Although Buffy and {{her friends}} deal with death every week, often in very gruesome and fantastic ways, in this episode they are bewildered by the natural death of Joyce Summers, the {{divorced}} mother of Buffy and her sister Dawn and occasionally a mother figure to their friends. They struggle to comprehend what the loss means {{to each of them}} and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>group.</b> Buffy must begin to face her life and her duties as the Slayer without parental support and comfort. The episode was stripped of all music—a regular staple of the Buffy series—and disorienting effects were included to convey the sense of displacement and loss associated with the death of a close family member.|$|E
5|$|Although the Rose Room {{was removed}} from the Algonquin in a 1998 remodel, the hotel paid tribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> by {{commissioning}} and hanging the painting A Vicious Circle by Natalie Ascencios, depicting the Round Table and also created a replica of the original table. The hotel occasionally stages an original musical production, The Talk of the Town, in the Oak Room. Its latest production started September 11, 2007 and ran {{through the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Applewhite and Nettles {{sometimes}} made sudden, {{drastic changes}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>group.</b> On one occasion in Texas, they told their followers of a forthcoming visitation from extraterrestrials and instructed them to wait outside all night, {{at which point}} they informed them that this had been merely a test. Lalich sees this as {{a way that they}} increased their students' devotion, ensuring that their commitment became irrespective of what they saw. Members became desperate for Applewhite's approval, which he used to control them.|$|E

IFK advanced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> {{stage of the}} Champions League, where they faced FC Barcelona, Manchester United and Galatasaray. Elimination at the group stage was widely anticipated, but IFK Göteborg confounded expectations by winning the group and advancing to the knockout stage. However, IFK Göteborg was eliminated in the quarter-finals by Bayern Munich on away goals.|$|E
5|$|Both {{males and}} females can defend the pride against intruders, but the male lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, more {{powerful}} build. Some individuals consistently lead the defence against intruders, while others lag behind. Lions tend to assume specific roles in the pride. Those lagging behind may provide other valuable services <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>group.</b> An alternative hypothesis {{is that there is}} some reward associated with being a leader who fends off intruders, and the rank of lionesses in the pride is reflected in these responses. The male or males associated with the pride must defend their relationship to the pride from outside males who attempt to take over their relationship with the pride.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the title}} of the episode and the {{invocation}} spoken by the character of Sammael refer to four of the nine choirs of angels in Christian mythology. Christian angelology holds that there are three groupings of three choirs each. The Thrones are the third-highest ranking choir, belonging <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> charged with attending to God, and are described as stern incarnations of holy justice. Dominions, the fourth-highest choir, belong <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> appointed to deal with God's creations. Dominions lead the lower orders and impart wisdom to humanity. Powers belong to the same tier as Dominions, and are tasked with countering the threat of temptation by the devil and demons. Principalities are the seventh-highest ranking choir and belong to the lowest grouping of angels, those most likely to appear to mankind. Principalities oversee those humans who rule over others, teaching kings and heads of families the skills needed to lead.|$|E
5000|$|Cultural theorist Paul Virilio {{likewise}} {{described the}} San Diego-based UFO religious group Heaven's Gate as a cybersect, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>group's</b> {{heavy reliance on}} CMC {{as a mode of}} communication prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>group's</b> 1997 collective suicide; while Rita M.
