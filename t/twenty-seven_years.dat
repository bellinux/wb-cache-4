5|$|In 1982 Edwards, by now an {{established}} scholar of diplomatic history, was appointed Official Historian and general editor of The Official History of Australia's Involvement in Southeast Asian Conflicts 1948–1975. Based {{out of the}} Australian War Memorial (AWM) in Canberra, the multi-volume history was commissioned to cover Australia's involvement in the Malayan Emergency, Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation and Vietnam War. Edwards continued the tradition established by Charles Bean, Gavin Long and Robert J. O'Neill in Australia's earlier official war histories by adopting a holistic approach that sought to analyse the operational, strategic, political, social and medical aspects of the Australian experience. But in dealing with <b>twenty-seven</b> <b>years</b> of history, the series spanned the longest time period of an Australian official history commissioned to that time. The end result was a nine-volume series, published between 1992 and 2012, with contributions from nine historians.|$|E

5|$|The {{fortunes}} of the Eastern Chalukyas took a turn around 1000. Danarnava, their king, was killed in battle in 973 by the Telugu Choda King Bhima who then imposed his rule over the region for <b>twenty-seven</b> <b>years.</b> During this time, Danarnava's two sons took refuge in the Chola kingdom. Choda Bhima's invasion of Tondaimandalam, a Chola territory, and his subsequent death on the battlefield opened up {{a new era in}} Chola–Chalukya relations. SaktivarmanI, the elder son of Danarnava was crowned as the ruler of Vengi in 1000, though under the control of king Rajaraja CholaI. This new relationship between the Cholas and the coastal Andhra kingdom was unacceptable to the Western Chalukyas, who had by then replaced the Rashtrakutas as the main power in the western Deccan. The Western Chalukyas sought to brook the growing Chola influence in the Vengi region but were unsuccessful.|$|E

An early Poe biographer, William Gill, gathered the bones and stored them in a box he hid under his bed.

Poe himself had died in 1849, and so Gill took Virginia's remains and, after corresponding with Neilson Poe and John Prentiss Poe in Baltimore, arranged to bring the box down to be laid on Poe's left side in a small bronze casket. Virginia's remains were finally buried with her husband's on January 19, 1885the seventy-sixth anniversary of her husband's birth and nearly ten years after his current monument was erected.
