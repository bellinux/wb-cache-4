5|$|Despite the show's success, Chapman {{was still}} unsure about abandoning his medical career. In {{between the two}} series of At Last the 1948 Show he {{completed}} his studies at St Bartholomew's, and became professionally registered as a doctor. Chapman and Cleese also wrote for the long-running television comedy series Doctor in the House, and both appeared on a one-off television special, How to Irritate People alongside Brooke-Taylor and Michael Palin. One of Cleese and Chapman's sketches, featuring a used car salesman refusing <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>a</b> customer's model had broken down, became {{the inspiration for the}} Dead Parrot sketch. Chapman also co-wrote several episodes of Doctor in the House follow up, Doctor in Charge, with Bernard McKenna.|$|E
5|$|Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) {{investigate}} the fatal shooting of a man, who was apparently killed for a $1.49 pen. Lewis believes {{there must be}} more to the story, refusing <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>a</b> pen is worth killing for. When they search suspect Mitchell Forman's (Sal S. Koussa) apartment, they find thousands of pens, many of which line the walls like bizarre decorations. Lewis later finds Forman at the police station, where he originally planned to turn himself in, but instead {{went up to the}} roof to commit suicide. Lewis lures Forman away from the ledge by enticing him with a beautiful golden pen, which belonged to Lewis' deceased grandmother. Forman is taken into custody. Later, Lewis still cannot believe someone would kill over a pen, but Gee (Yaphet Kotto) suggests it is no worse than killing over a car or woman. Lewis, determined not to develop such a strong attachment to a material item, gives his grandmother's pen to Felton (Daniel Baldwin).|$|E

25|$|Chauvel's {{plan was}} to envelop and capture the Shunet Nimrin {{garrison}} and cut their lines of communication; firstly by the capture of Es Salt by light horse who would block the main road to Amman and secondly by the Beni Sakhr who were to capture Ain es Sir and block that track. With Shunet Nimrin isolated there was every reason <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>a</b> frontal attack by British infantry from the Jordan Valley, with the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade covering their right flank, would succeed.|$|E

25|$|Quantification was a chief {{concern of}} Hull's studies, and he {{continued}} to apply this interest to behaviorism. While interested {{in the work of}} Watson, he was not entirely convinced. After listening to lectures by gestalt psychologist Kurt Koffka, he began to work towards a neobehaviorism. His goal was to determine the laws of behavior and how they can be used to determine future behaviors. His work with the computing machine led him <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>a</b> machine could be built to replicate mental processes.|$|E
25|$|A typeII error {{occurs when}} the null {{hypothesis}} is false, but erroneously fails to be rejected. It is failing to assert what is present, a miss. A typeII error may be compared with a so-called false negative (where an actual 'hit' was disregarded by the test and seen as a 'miss') in a test checking for a single condition with a definitive result of true or false. A Type II error is committed when we fail <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>a</b> true alternative hypothesis. In terms of folk tales, an investigator may fail to see the wolf ("failing to raise an alarm"). Again, H0: no wolf.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} {{legislative}} session in 2003, Anderson championed House Bill 49, {{of which he}} was co-sponsor, to expand the state DNA database by requiring DNA samples from all convicted felons; any person convicted of a felony or misdemeanor crime against a person, such as assault; and anyone convicted of a misdemeanor sex offense. The bill applied the DNA sample requirement retroactively to people currently imprisoned or on parole for those crimes, as well as anyone required to register as a sex offender. Some serious juvenile offenders were also included under HB 49. The bill enjoyed wide bipartisan support, and was signed into law by Gov. Frank Murkowski on June 13, 2003. However, in October 2003 a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order which disallowed the state from requiring DNA samples from convicted sex offenders who had completed their sentences unless the state had first obtained a warrant and shown probable cause <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>a</b> crime had been committed. Ultimately, the portion of the law requiring registered sex offenders who had completed their sentences to provide DNA samples was struck down as unconstitutional by U.S. District Judge John Sedwick; other provisions of the law remained intact.|$|E

25|$|Sir Rowland {{wonders if}} there is {{anything}} written on the autographed papers in invisible ink and they test them, revealing the names of six distributors of drugs, including Costello. Going to tell the police their findings, the sleeping Pippa is left alone and, after a moment, Jeremy re-enters and is about to smother the girl's face with a cushion when Clarissa comes back. She soon realises that he is the killer. He was away from the other two men for a time after they had gone to the club to eat and a remark Pippa made about seeing his golf club ("A golf stick like Jeremy had", {{in the context of the}} weapon used to kill Costello) ties in. He also rang the police to try to incriminate Clarissa. Jeremy confesses; his motive was the envelope that the autographed papers were kept in – on it is an extremely rare error stamp worth the fourteen thousand pounds. He is about to kill Clarissa when the police enter the room, having heard the exchange, and arrest him. They take him away. The others go to bed and Henry returns but without his diplomatic guests who have failed to turn up. Like the police inspector, he fails <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>a</b> word his wife tells him of the evening's events...|$|E

[...] The Leafs won the 1962 championship shortly before Barilko's remains were discovered. [...] In 1963, they repeated as champions. [...] In 1964, the Leafs again played for the Stanley Cup against the Red Wings. [...] In the third period of game six, trailing the series 3–2, Maple Leafs' defenceman Bobby Baun suffered a broken ankle from a Gordie Howe slap shot. [...] Despite the injury, Baun returned with his ankle taped up to score the winning goal in overtime. [...] Baun also played the seventh game as the Maple Leafs defeated the Red Wings to win their third consecutive title.|$|E
500|$|The Non-Intervention Committee was {{established}} to enforce the Non-Intervention Agreement. Germany was represented by Joachim von Ribbentrop (with Otto Christian Archibald von Bismarck as deputy) but left the running to the Italian Dino Grandi, although they found working with him difficult. [...] It became clear the Non-Intervention Agreement was not preventing German aid to the Nationalists. On 18 November, the German government recognised the Nationalists as the true government of Spain. Germany met the request to ban volunteers on 7 January. Hitler himself authored the German declaration. German uneasiness about the scale, limitations and outcomes of intervention in Spain remained. German diplomats spoke as if their men in Spain were genuine volunteers. However, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia continued <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>a</b> European war was not in their best interests.|$|E
500|$|When police {{conduct a}} search, the {{amendment}} {{requires that the}} warrant establish probable cause {{to believe that the}} search will uncover criminal activity or contraband. They must have legally sufficient reasons <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>a</b> search is necessary. In Carroll v. United States (1925), the Supreme Court stated that probable cause to search is a flexible, common-sense standard. To that end, the Court ruled in Dumbra v. United States (1925) that the term probable cause means [...] "less than evidence that would justify condemnation", reiterating Carrolls assertion that it merely requires that the facts available to the officer would [...] "warrant a man of reasonable caution" [...] in the belief that specific items may be contraband or stolen property or useful as evidence of a crime. It does not demand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false. A [...] "practical, non-technical" [...] probability that incriminating evidence is involved is all that is required. In Illinois v. Gates (1983), the Court ruled that the reliability of an informant is to be determined based on the [...] "totality of the circumstances." ...|$|E
