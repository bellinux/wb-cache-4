5|$|One {{study has}} shown {{theoretically}} that, while a bike leaned in a turn, road undulations can excite <b>the</b> <b>weave</b> mode {{at high speed}} or the wobble mode at low speed if either of their frequencies match the vehicle speed and other parameters. Excitation of the wobble mode can be mitigated by an effective steering damper and excitation of <b>the</b> <b>weave</b> mode is worse for light riders than for heavy riders.|$|E
5|$|The {{forward speed}} at which {{oscillations}} do not increase, where <b>the</b> <b>weave</b> mode eigenvalues switch from positive to negative in a Hopf bifurcation at about 5.3m/s (12mph) in this example, is called <b>the</b> <b>weave</b> speed. Below this speed, oscillations increase until the uncontrolled bike falls over. Above this speed, oscillations eventually die out.|$|E

5|$|Experimentation {{with real}} bikes {{has so far}} {{confirmed}} <b>the</b> <b>weave</b> mode predicted by the eigenvalues. It was found that tire slip and frame flex are not important for the lateral dynamics of the bicycle in the speed range up to 6 m/s.

25|$|The {{reinforcement}} type defines {{two major}} classes of materials - woven and non-woven. Woven reinforcements are cheaper, {{but the high}} dielectric constant of glass may not be favorable for many higher-frequency applications.

Nonwoven reinforcements, or materials with low or no reinforcement, are more expensive but more suitable for some RF/analog applications.|$|E

25|$|Lint is {{the common}} name for visible accumulations of textile fibers and other {{materials}}, usually found on and around clothing. Certain materials used {{in the manufacture of}} clothing, such as cotton, linen, and wool, contain numerous, very short fibers bundled together. During the course of normal wear, these fibers may either detach or be jostled out of <b>the</b> <b>weave</b> of which they are part. This is the reason that heavily used articles like shirts and towels become thin over time, and why these particles collect in the lint screen of a clothes dryer.|$|E
25|$|Flows and weaves {{are visible}} to fellow channelers but {{limited by the}} viewer's access to either saidin or saidar. This {{visibility}} allows channelers {{to learn how to}} construct specific weaves and access abilities merely by watching another channeler create <b>the</b> <b>weave.</b> While male and female channelers have access to many of the same abilities and end effects, the weaves and manner of their construction are often very different. The act of channeling saidin is apparently very different from saidar, whereas women describe surrendering themselves to the One Power and allowing it to flow through them, men insist that similar behavior would be suicidal. They describe channeling as a struggle for control that would result in their own destruction if they ever faltered.|$|E
25|$|Weaving {{normally}} begins {{from the}} bottom of the loom, by passing a number of wefts through the warps to form a base to start from. Knots of dyed wool, cotton or silk threads are then tied in rows around consecutive sets of adjacent warps. As more rows are tied to the foundation, these knots become the pile of the rug. Between each row of knots, one or more shots of weft are passed to keep the knots fixed. The wefts are then beaten down by a comb-like instrument, the comb beater, to further compact and secure the newly-woven row. Depending on the fineness of <b>the</b> <b>weave,</b> the quality of the materials and the expertise of the weavers, the knot count of a handmade rug can vary anywhere from 16 to 800 knots per square inch.|$|E

500|$|In June 1942, Post editor Ben Hibbs became {{supportive}} of Rockwell's Four Freedoms sketches, and gave Rockwell {{two months to}} complete the works. By October, the Post was worried about Rockwell's progress on the Four Freedoms and sent their art editor to Arlington to evaluate. At that time Rockwell was working on Freedom of Worship, his second painting in the series. Rockwell spent two months (October and most of November 1942) on this work, that {{was inspired by the}} phrase [...] "Each according to the dictates of his own conscience." [...] His Arlington, Vermont, neighbors served as his models: Three months pregnant with her hair upbraided, Rose Hoyt posed as a Catholic with a rosary, even though she was actually Protestant of the Episcopal Church. Other models were a Mrs. Harrington, Rockwell's carpenter Walter Squires, Squire's wife Clara Squires (at the right-hand edge), Winfield Secoy, and Jim Martin (center). His final version relied on other visual clues, including a rosary and a religious book. The work had dark-skinned black worshipers juxtaposed on the edges. This placement did not rock the boat with The Post who had not yet featured blacks prominently on its pages. Rockwell said he made these ethnics palatable by [...] "'furtively' painting the face of the black woman at the top; the man at the bottom, with his fez, was too obviously foreign to offend." [...] The image is commonly enhanced and often darkened in reproduction because it uses a color combination of soft greys, beiges and browns. [...] The paint was applied thinly, which allows <b>the</b> <b>weave</b> of the canvas to contribute to the image.|$|E
