5|$|Traditionally it is Jean-Baptiste Say who is {{credited}} for coining {{the word and}} advancing the concept of <b>the</b> <b>entrepreneur,</b> {{but in fact it}} was Cantillon who first introduced the term in Essai. Cantillon divided society into two principal classes—fixed income wage-earners and non-fixed income earners. Entrepreneurs, according to Cantillon, are non-fixed income earners who pay known costs of production but earn uncertain incomes, due to the speculative nature of pandering to an unknown demand for their product. Cantillon, while providing the foundations, did not develop a dedicated theory of uncertainty—the topic was not revisited until the 20th century, by Ludwig von Mises, Frank Knight, and John Maynard Keynes, among others. Furthermore, unlike later theories of entrepreneurship which saw <b>the</b> <b>entrepreneur</b> as a disruptive force, Cantillon anticipated the belief that <b>the</b> <b>entrepreneur</b> brought equilibrium to a market by correctly predicting consumer preferences.|$|E
5|$|Looms {{were not}} {{controlled}} by the guilds. Dependent on a migrant workforce, their commercial activity was driven by entrepreneurs, who were usually painters. <b>The</b> <b>entrepreneur</b> would locate and commission patrons, hold a stock of cartoons and provide raw materials such as wool, silk, and sometimes gold and silver – which often had to be imported. <b>The</b> <b>entrepreneur</b> was {{in direct contact with}} the patron, and they would often go through the nuances of the design at both the cartoon and final stages. This examination was often a difficult business and necessitated delicate management; in 1400 Isabeau of Bavaria rejected a completed set by Colart de Laon having earlier approved the designs, to de Laon's – and presumably his commissioner's – considerable embarrassment.|$|E

Cantillon's Essai had significant influence on the early development of political economy, including the works of Adam Smith, Anne Turgot, Jean-Baptiste Say, Frédéric Bastiat and François Quesnay.|$|E

5|$|Apart from {{originating}} {{theories on}} <b>the</b> <b>entrepreneur</b> and spatial economics, Cantillon {{also provided a}} dedicated theory on population growth. Unlike William Petty, who believed there always existed {{a considerable amount of}} unused land and economic opportunity to support economic growth, Cantillon theorised that population grows only {{as long as there are}} economic opportunities present. Specifically, Cantillon cited three determining variables for population size: natural resources, technology, and culture. Therefore, populations grow only as far as the three aforementioned variables allowed. Furthermore, Cantillon's population theory was more modern than that of Malthus in the sense that Cantillon recognised a much broader category of factors which affect population growth, including the tendency for population growth to fall to zero as a society becomes more industrialised.|$|E

On 1October1863 the Wycombe Railway also built a line to Aylesbury, from Princes Risborough railway station to a station on the western side of Aylesbury (the present-day Aylesbury railway station). The arrival of the railway had a powerful impact on the duck industry, and up to a ton of ducks in a night were being shipped from Aylesbury to Smithfield Market in London by 1850.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIllustration of {{entrepreneurial}} action plan. Abstract The entrepreneurship {{development is}} mainly {{due to the}} entrepreneurial motivation. <b>The</b> motivation of <b>entrepreneurs</b> {{is influenced by the}} external as well as internal environmental factors. Though there is no research study which reveals the extent to which <b>the</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> are motivated by these two environments it is found that the entrepreneurial motivation is due to the influence of both the external and internal environmental factors. The psychological behaviours of <b>the</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> are also equal playing its role while motivating <b>the</b> <b>entrepreneurs,</b> which are also discussed here. This paper also helps <b>entrepreneurs</b> to identify <b>the</b> different business opportunities and growth of the existing business. A real entrepreneur is a person who generally motivated by intrinsic psychological and also economic rewards. He indigenously tries an entrepreneurial venture for his personal satisfaction in work, ego or status. This paper reviews the psychological literature on entrepreneurs. Assessment and generalizations for <b>the</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> are risky since there is no specific population of entrepreneurs. Psychological characteristics: In the modem days a suitable entrepreneurial culture must be created by developing healthy work environment and modem attitude towards work giving social recognition etc. These factors will provide the psychological stimulus which in turn promotes innovation, inspiration, ethics and values which are essential for successful <b>entrepreneurs.</b> <b>The</b> irrational behaviours of <b>the</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> are also playing a vital role while motivating <b>the</b> <b>entrepreneurs...</b>|$|R

The local community resisted demolition of the worst estates, and the government tightly controlled building regulations in the village while attempting to rehouse residents elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Ravalomanana {{decided to}} {{register}} {{as an independent}} candidate in the Antananarivo mayoral election rather than finance a representative from another party. The president of the Judged by Your Work Party (AVI), Norbert Lala Ratsirahonana, had met <b>the</b> <b>entrepreneur</b> several years prior in relation to Tiko business matters. The two discussed the possibility that Ravalomanana could run as an AVI candidate, but this idea was abandoned. His principal opponent, former Prime Minister Guy Willy Razanamasy of the Association for the Rebirth of Madagascar (AREMA party), suffered from low popularity, leading Ratsiraka to tacitly support Ravalomanana's candidature against the representative of his own party. By contrast, Ravalomanana was an unknown, attracting attention primarily for his considerable success in employment and wealth creation through Tiko, and his esteemed role as Vice President of the Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar, which was vocal in its support for the candidate.|$|E

5|$|Ravalomanana {{solicited}} a {{loan from}} the Agence Française de Développement to further expand his business, but this request was denied, souring his view of France. His subsequent request to the World Bank for 1.5 million US dollars was approved, and in 1982 he founded the Tiko company. The representative of the World Bank to Madagascar at the time, José Broffman, secured the loan with exceptionally favorable reimbursement conditions that enabled Ravalomanana to sell his products {{at a lower cost}} than other small dairy producers, which gradually put his most significant competitors out of business. Broffman later left his post at the World Bank to become a principal investor in the company, joined by private investors from South Africa, Germany and the United States. As Tiko continued to grow, <b>the</b> <b>entrepreneur</b> began incorporating imported ingredients such as powdered milk from South Africa (constituting 80 per cent of the composition of Tiko dairy products) and surplus butter from Europe, further improving the profitability of his business and enabling additional diversification. Tiko Group first concentrated exclusively on the production of dairy products before expanding into fruit juices, ice cream, cooking oil and carbonated beverages. The Tiko slogan printed on many of the group's products, Vita Malagasy ("Made in Madagascar"), reflected Ravalomanana's national pride and his vision that Madagascar should develop a larger capacity to produce quality goods for distribution for national and international markets.|$|E
