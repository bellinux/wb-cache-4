5|$|In <b>this</b> <b>night</b> {{battle the}} 64th Field Artillery Battalion, {{supporting}} the 1st Battalion, became {{directly involved in}} the fighting. About 50 North Koreans infiltrated before dawn to A Battery's position and assaulted it. North Koreans employing submachine guns overran two artillery-machine-gun perimeter positions, penetrating to the artillery pieces at 03:00. There, Captain Andrew C. Anderson and his men fought hand-to-hand combat with the North Koreans. Some of the guns fell temporarily into North Korean hands but the artillerymen repulsed the attack, aided by the concentrations of fire from C Battery, 90th Field Artillery Battalion nearby, which cut off the North Koreans from reinforcements. In defending its guns in <b>this</b> <b>night</b> battle, A Battery lost seven men killed and 12 wounded.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Halloween had turned into a night of vandalism, with {{destruction}} of property and cruelty to animals and people. Around 1912, the BSA, Boys Clubs and other neighborhood organizations came together to encourage a safe celebration that would end the destruction that had become so common on <b>this</b> <b>night.</b>|$|E
5|$|The U.S. PT boats did not sortie {{to attack}} Hashimoto's force <b>this</b> <b>night</b> and the loading went uneventfully. The Reinforcement Force {{embarked}} Hyakutake, his staff, and 3,921 men, {{mainly from the}} 2nd Division, and reached Bougainville without incident by 12:50 on 5 February. A CAF airstrike launched that morning failed to locate Hashimoto's force.|$|E

5|$|Artillery and 90mm {{tank fire}} {{destroyed}} seven more North Korean T-34 tanks, three more SU-76 towed guns, and several trucks and personnel carriers. <b>This</b> <b>night</b> battle, {{which was at}} times very intense, lasted about five hours. The US B Battery, 8th Field Artillery Battalion alone fired 1,661 105mm rounds, the 4.2-inch mortar platoon fired 902 rounds, the 81mm mortar platoon fired 1,200 rounds, and F Company, 27th Infantry fired 385 60mm mortar rounds. The North Korean column was completely destroyed. US patrols after daylight estimated the North Koreans had suffered 1,300 casualties in the fight. Eleven prisoners captured by the patrol said the action had decimated their units and that the division was only at 25 percent strength.|$|E
5|$|At midday on 3 March 1945 {{teletype}} {{messages from}} Bomber Command Headquarters at RAF High Wycombe began reaching the airfields of RAF squadrons in Eastern England. On <b>this</b> <b>night</b> a planned raid with moderate numbers of bombers was planned over western Germany. A complex plan of feint attacks and diversions to deceive German air defence system were drawn up. The main force was {{split into two}} separate groups in the Münster area; No. 4 Group RAF were ordered to destroy the synthetic oil plant at Kamen and No. 5 Group RAF would attempt to eliminate the aqueduct, safety gates, and canal boats on the Dortmund–Ems Canal at Ladbergen.|$|E
5|$|The National Basketball Association {{was still}} {{struggling}} in its 16th season, {{not yet a}} major sports league and less established than college basketball. The league was hardly national, with only one team, the Los Angeles Lakers, west of St. Louis. The NBA received low television ratings, and this game was not televised. The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) considered not renewing the league's television contract. No members from the New York press were present as reporters were in Florida covering spring training for the New York Yankees and the expansion New York Mets. With few in the media present, the Warriors' publicist was tasked <b>this</b> <b>night</b> with being the stringer for the Associated Press (AP), United Press International (UPI), and The Philadelphia Inquirer. Only two photographers were at the game.|$|E

5|$|Cunningham {{took off}} <b>this</b> <b>night</b> from RAF Middle Wallop in Hampshire to patrol north of London. When the {{direction}} of the raid was known he was ordered to proceed to the East Midlands. GCI vectored Cunningham and his temporary radar operator John Phillipson—a former ground radar operator—onto an enemy aircraft, but the crew were forced much further westward. Search lights attracted their attention and Phillipson was able to make a contact and guide him. Soon visual confirmation was made. A tell-tale sign of an aircraft was a blank patch of sky surrounded by a cluster of stars. Keeping in the enemy's blind spot, he flew below it and adjusted his speed to match the German pilot. After closing the range as much as he dared, he fired with all four cannons and the Junkers Ju 88 exploded upon hitting the ground near Wittering, Cambridgeshire at 00:35. Cunningham's victim, 3./KG 54 Ju 88 flown by Unteroffizier Kaspar Sondermeister, was not claimed as destroyed. However, after interrogation of the two German survivors who affirmed the circumstances, Cunningham was granted the victory.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 5,000 RAF airmen {{prepared}} {{to take part in}} 817 heavy bombers which were fueled and armed in the evening. A trigger plan was prepared, which would act as a feint but, <b>this</b> <b>night,</b> Bomber Command amended the feint which was partially compromised by weather conditions. Restrictions on the flight path of the bombers was also changed. Bomber streams were permitted to fly over Ingoldmells Point to Filey; but not over coastal areas where no ground defences were stationed. The route took them downstream to southern England by Reading, and across the English Channel, as the trigger plan required. However, they were then ordered to turn back toward the North Sea. The reason behind this was the low-lying cloud which was ever-present over the continent that night. The clouds made it difficult for pilots to see and steer clear of zones heavily guarded by Allied ground defences near to the frontline. The possibility of losing aircraft to Friendly fire was too great.|$|E
5|$|That {{night was}} quiet {{until just before}} dawn. The North Koreans then {{launched}} an attack against the 9th Infantry {{on the right of}} the marines, the heaviest blow striking G Company. It had begun to rain again and the attack came {{in the midst of a}} downpour. In bringing his platoon from an outpost position to the relief of the company, Sergeant First Class Loren R. Kaufman encountered an encircling North Korean force on the ridge line. He bayoneted the lead scout and engaged those following with grenades and rifle fire. His sudden attack confused and dispersed this group. Kaufman led his platoon on and succeeded in joining hard-pressed G Company. In the ensuing action Kaufman led assaults against close-up North Korean positions and, in hand-to-hand fighting, he bayoneted four more North Korean soldiers, destroyed a machine gun position, and killed the crew members of a North Korean mortar. American artillery fire concentrated in front of the 9th Infantry helped greatly in repelling the North Koreans in <b>this</b> <b>night</b> and day battle.|$|E

5|$|Australian airmen were {{involved}} in Allied efforts to delay German reinforcements from reaching Normandy throughout June. On the night of 6/7 June, 20 Mosquitos from No.464 Squadron were dispatched to attack German road convoys and trains in northern France. The four Australian heavy bomber squadrons also participated in raids on French towns on <b>this</b> <b>night.</b> While No.463, No.466 and No.467 Squadrons mainly targeted railway facilities, No.460 Squadron formed part of an attack on Vire, which sought to destroy the town to prevent the Germans from using the roads through it. Following these initial raids, Bomber Command continued to target railway infrastructure in France {{in an attempt to}} disrupt the movement of German reinforcements to Normandy. The command operated intensively during the week after the invasion, and some Australian aircrew flew raids on consecutive nights during this period. Overall, Bomber Command made 16 raids against railway facilities in France between 13 and 30 June, of which six included {{at least one of the}} RAAF squadrons. The RAAF heavy bomber squadrons and Australians in RAF units also took part in several attacks on German supply dumps and airfields during this period. Bomber Command made fewer raids on these targets than had been planned prior to the invasion, however, as its units were frequently assigned to strike facilities associated with the V-1 flying bombs the Germans were launching against the UK. No.464 Squadron also operated against German vehicles travelling at night and bombed railway yards, and flew 75 sorties between the nights of 7/8 and 12/13 June. Overall, the squadron conducted attacks on 19 nights during June, during which five of its aircraft were destroyed. The Australians in 2TAF's other light and medium bomber units also attacked the German lines of communication in France and occasionally provided direct support for the Allied ground forces throughout this period.|$|E
