40|$|Abstract—Taxes have no voluntary, but {{mandatory}} character. Taxation {{is as old}} as government. The fact is {{that most}} taxpayers, if not all, prefer to reduce their taxes. In the United States, when making decisions about the best methods that would be used in the collection of public revenue, the majority of Member States considered that the characteristics of good tax system, respectively principles of taxation are: efficiency, simplicity of administration, flexibility, political responsibility, fairness. In Serbian tax system, we distinguish the following tax principles: richnesst, elasticity, efficiency, moderate tax burden, choice of tax sources, stability of the tax system, <b>tax</b> legality, <b>flexibility.</b> The main objectives of the tax reform system in our country after 2000 year were: efficient economy; economy above politics; reduction of public expenditures; adaptation to European legislation; increased tax collection.

40|$|AbstractDespite {{promises}} {{that they can}} contribute toward more environmentally beneficial transportation there are many sustainability concerns about liquid transport biofuels. In response to pressure from civil society, the European Union (EU) has introduced sustainability criteria for biofuels. A hybrid regulatory system involving state and non-state actors stipulates that retailers and producers must comply {{to be eligible for}} fiscal support such as <b>tax</b> exemptions. <b>Flexibility</b> in the system allows choice between different means of compliance, including a range of voluntary schemes. We present an analysis of views within the Swedish liquid transport biofuel sector in 2012 – a year after the introduction of EU sustainability criteria. Using document analysis, official statistics, and a survey, we use four key structures of global value chains — input–output structure, territorial configuration, institutional framework, and firm-level chain governance structure — to structure an analysis of biofuel value chain coordination. This yields three main findings regarding how the Swedish liquid transport biofuel system operates within, and views, the new regulatory framework. Firstly that it uses a broad portfolio of feedstock mainly from within Europe, seemingly avoiding countries where any supply conditions may be in doubt; second, larger retailers and producers achieve compliance without the need to provide additional social sustainability information; third, that actors exhibit predominantly Eurocentric perspectives on sustainability, express confidence that their supply chains have strong ‘sustainability performance’ and desire long-term policy stability. We conclude that despite a deep critique of the sustainability of biofuels amongst civil society and academia, EU regulation allows for production systems that reflect a European- and climate change mitigation-centred view on biofuel ‘sustainability’...|$|R

The article argues that there has been a substantial retreat from the “femocrat ” strategies adopted under Labor in the 1980 s and early 1990 s. The general thrust of the Howard government has been to discourage labor force partici-pation of mothers of young children, with the important exception of sole parents.

40|$|Emerging market {{financial}} crises {{during the late}} 1990 s were marked by sudden withdrawals of funds by foreign creditors, resulting in production declines. The IMF favored positive signals to potential foreign creditors and initially recommended disciplined fiscal policy {{during the height of}} crisis, countering standard Keynesian recommendations of expansionary fiscal stimulus. This paper formulates an open-economy general equilibrium model for resolving this policy conundrum and analyzing the impact of disciplined fiscal policy on post-crisis recovery. The model demonstrates via simulations that disciplined fiscal policy will improve (worsen) post-crisis recovery in the presence (absence) of appropriately defined production flexibility.

The study focuses on legal recognition of caregiver status in Belgium and the mandatory caregiver assessment in the United Kingdom (UK). Formal legal caregiver recognition would allow U.

40|$|Though to-date the European Union (EU) {{has played}} the most {{significant}} leadership role in international negotiations to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the emission-reducing performance of individual EU Member states has for many been less than stellar. Several EU 15 Member states continue to raise rather than lower emissions. Analysing the most successful policy instruments, this paper argues EU policy efforts could benefit from three important innovations. The following strategies – the adoption of an EU-wide FIT (feed-in tariff), an EU-wide carbon <b>tax</b> and more <b>flexibility</b> in the trading of carbon credits – could significantly improve emission reductions, their relative cost-efficiency and spread burden-sharing more evenly across technologies and Member states. This raises important questions, both {{about the effectiveness of}} EU and Kyoto-style commitments, as well as the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). The commitment strategy, and in particular the EU ETS mechanism, have had the smallest impact on emission reductions. The proposed set of strategies could make a far greater contribution to future EU efforts and potentially lock in the impressive progress already made. Such a policy shift, if successful, would also greatly enhance the EU’s already significant credibility and bargaining power in international climate negotiations.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a dynamic {{computable general equilibrium}} model in which optimizing agents evade taxes by operating in the underground economy. The cost to firms of evading taxes is that they find themselves subject to credit rationing from banks. Our model simulations show that {{in the absence of}} budgetary flexibility to adjust expenditures, raising tax rates too high drives firms into the underground economy, thereby reducing the tax base. Aggregate investment in the economy is lowered because of credit rationing. Taxes that are too low eliminate the underground economy, but result in unsustainable budget and trade deficits. Thus, the optimal rate of taxation, from a macroeconomic point of view, may lead to some underground activity.

40|$|The Czech Republic has {{embarked}} on an ambitious tax reform and expenditure package to bring the deficit sustainably below 3 percent, and intends {{to reduce the deficit}} to 1 percent of GDP by 2012. To address the long-term fiscal challenge due to population aging, pension reform proposals are also being considered. In this paper we assess the macroeconomic effects of these measures using the Global Fiscal Model. The tax reform package will achieve a more efficient tax system. If implemented successfully with the intended expenditure savings measures, debt is projected to improve markedly while output would expand. Fiscal sustainability will not be restored, however, even if further measures to bring the deficit to 1 percent of GDP by 2012. Instead, raising the retirement age and prefunding future aging costs would be needed to keep debt below 60 percent of GDP through 2050.

40|$|This paper {{summarized}} {{the theory of}} welfare economics and natural resource allocation, and illustrated how application of this theory can lead to Pareto improvements {{in the design of}} irrigation systems in tropical arid- and semi-arid agricultural systems. Drawing on the two examples of nitrate losses and salinization, the paper concludes that economic analysis can help design policies to conserve natural resource stocks, but that such analysis is limited by insufficient data, methodological difficulties, and by a lack of integration between natural and social research. A portion of the paper discusses the physical and biological processes associated with nitrate losses and salinization, and review research on their magnitudes in arid- and semi-arid zones. This review demonstrates that certain combinations of hydrological conditions and farming systems will likely result in nitrate losses and/or salinization. The design of irrigated systems in these cases might be improved by analyzing the externalities associated with these phenomena. There are two policy approaches - curative and preventive - to mitigate losses from nitrate pollution and salinization. Preventive policies, which entail directive measures (e. g., standards) or the creation of economic incentives and disincentives, are generally more cost-effective and risk-reducing. Taxes, however, should be avoided where natural resource demand is inelastic. Combining subsidies with <b>taxes</b> allows greatest <b>flexibility</b> in cost distribution, but reduces the net benefits from mitigation. Given the institutional weakness of most lower income countries, governments attempting improved management of natural resource stocks must rely primarily on conservation subsidies rather than on standards, taxes, or curative measures. More generally, informed judgments on the magnitude of externalities associated with any one natural and social environment depend on information being available to economists. Yet comparative data on agro-ecological research should be designed to illuminated the policy implications of natural resource management. The effects of irrigation on soil fertility and on water quality are two high-priority topics. Economists need to evaluate the contributions of natural resource quality to individual well-being. Policy makers meanwhile may choose to establish qualitative standards for important natural resources, and to distinguish among broad categories of natural resources based on their substitutability. Economists also must understand how current policies generate farm-level incentives for overuse of natural resources, since corrective policies may vary for different incentives. Finally, economists should closely examine {{the degree to which the}} use of high discount rates in economic analysis leads to environmental degradation by reducing the value of future benefits and costs.

40|$|The article {{builds on}} the Hall-Rabushka Flat Tax and proposes a {{consumption}} tax called the “E Tax,” which is an electronically collected credit invoice VAT. The Hall-Rabushka Flat Tax is a two-tier consumption tax {{that is based on}} a subtraction method VAT. The Hall-Rabushka nuance, however, allows a deduction for wages as if they were purchases of materials by the employer. Wage earners would be taxed on those wages at rates that could be set as graduated or flat, with or without a zero rate or bracket amount and with or without personal exemptions and deductions. Hall and Rabushka proposed a flat rate equal to the VAT rate, with a zero bracket amount, personal exemptions and limited individual deductions. The E Tax modifies the Flat Tax by substituting a credit invoice business level VAT for the subtraction VAT. As such, the business tax would become a point of sale or transaction tax, which could be collected in each transaction rather than annually. Thus, one could combine the credit invoice VAT, modified for wages (as discussed in detail in the article), with a wage tax in order to build in progressivity. This modification to the two tier Flat Tax structure would both improve compliance and facilitate a pay-as-you-go collection system. Transaction taxes lend themselves to electronic tracking and tax collection, and therefore impose an automatic framework to the taxing process. Moreover, the administrative characteristic of annual accounting and collection can be eliminated by basing the tax on a modified credit invoice VAT instead of a subtraction VAT. As suggested above, progressivity and any desired personalizing of the tax would be introduced at the wage earner level, as it could be with the Hall-Rabushka Flat Tax. The mechanics of the wage tax collection, however, would be slightly different under the E Tax. The modification suggested in the paper builds in the prospect of graduated rates and a substitute for the Earned Income Tax Credit in an automatic way. Thus, the E Tax, in contrast to the Flat Tax, is a transaction tax and therefore facilitates point-of-sale collection. Nevertheless, like the Flat Tax, it still permits greater progressivity than a straight business level VAT, because the separate wage tax component of the <b>tax</b> allows for <b>flexibility</b> in <b>tax</b> rates, exemptions and deductions. Although this characteristic may appear to be a simple detail without a great conceptual difference, the characteristic of taxing transactions and dispensing with annual accounting in fact makes an enormous practical difference. It would facilitate electronic collection and auditing to ensure compliance. It thereby should reduce costs of compliance and significantly reduce the tax gap. Moreover, the E Tax takes advantage of computer technology that will only get better as the twenty-first century progresses and the shift continues away from cash transactions to electronic transactions, including debit cards, credit cards and electronic funds transfers...|$|R
