Currently the transmission {{is available in}} the 6R models, although it will likely be phased out in favour of the new AutoPower (AutoPwr) transmission on the new 6230R and 6250R, announced in 2016. The tractors are expected to be in full production by mid - 2017 and the transmission used in them is expected to be seen in future John Deere machinery across the whole range, such as Forage and Combine harvesters. The AutoPower joystick used in the 6230R and 6250R can achieve the top speed from one push of <b>the</b> <b>toggle</b> and has several buttons integrated onto the stick that are programmable for different features. The tractors have also won the prestigious 'Machine of the Year' award 2017.|$|E

500|$|Peale {{returned}} from Europe with plans he had drawn for a steam-powered coinage press, borrowing the steam machinery design from English mints and <b>the</b> <b>toggle</b> joint technology from French ones. [...] In September, Patterson, by then Mint Director {{in place of}} the retired Moore, wrote to Secretary of the Treasury Levi Woodbury, [...] "we have just completed under the superintendence of Mr. Peale, a model of a coining press from plans which he saw in successful operation in France and in Germany, and possessing many very manifest advantages over the Screw press now applied at the Mint. Among these {{one of the most important}} is that [...] admits the immediate and easy application of steam power." [...] Director Patterson called March 23, 1836 [...] "an epoch in our coinage". To take advantage of the new press's increased production capacity, Peale designed a new machine to cut planchets, or blanks, from metal strips. This machine remained in use, almost unmodified, until 1902.|$|E
2500|$|A toggle {{light switch}} is a switch, most {{commonly}} used to operate electric lights, permanently connected equipment, or electrical outlets whereby the switch handle does not control the contacts directly, but through an intermediate arrangement of internal springs and levers. <b>The</b> <b>toggle</b> light switch is safe, reliable, and durable, but produces a loud [...] "snap" [...] or [...] "click" [...] noise when a person's finger manually flips <b>the</b> <b>toggle</b> light switch into the on/off position. The design for <b>the</b> <b>toggle</b> light switch was patented in 1916 by William J. Newton and Morris Goldberg of Lynbrook, New York.|$|E

2500|$|There are two rare {{variants}} {{that use}} the roller cam principle. [...] For locations where centre-pull is inappropriate, the side-pull [...] "toggle cam brake" [...] was developed. [...] Also a first-class cantilever, it uses a single-sided sliding cam (<b>the</b> <b>toggle)</b> against one arm that is attached by {{a link to the}} other arm. [...] As the cam presses against the follower, the force is also transmitted to the other arm via the link. [...] And specifically for suspension forks where the housing must terminate at the brake frame, the side-pull [...] "sabre cam brake" [...] was developed. In the sabre cam design, the cable end is fixed and the housing moves the single-sided cam.|$|E

A hoarse shout of disgust greeted the descent of the grapnel-rope and the swift leap of the balloon, and something--he fancied afterwards it was a turnip--whizzed by his head. The trail-rope followed its fellow. The crowd seemed to jump away from him. With an immense and horrifying rustle the balloon brushed against a telephone pole, and for a tense instant he anticipated either an electric explosion or a bursting of the oiled silk, or both. But fortune was with him.|$|E

These two motions, when combined, lead to an elliptical jaw motion. This motion is useful as it assists in pushing the particles through the crushing chamber. This phenomenon leads to higher capacity of <b>the</b> single <b>toggle</b> jaw crushers but it also results in higher wear of the crushing jaws.

50|$|The two flue harpoon was {{the primary}} weapon used in whaling around the world, but it cut through the blubber when under stress. This flaw was {{corrected}} {{with the creation of}} the single flue harpoon; by removing one of the flues, the head of the harpoon was narrowed, making it easier for it to penetrate deep enough to hold fast. In the Arctic, the indigenous people used <b>the</b> more advanced <b>toggling</b> harpoon design. In the early 19th century the one flue harpoon was introduced, which reduced failed harpoons due to the head cutting its way out of the body of the whale. In the mid-19th century, <b>the</b> <b>toggling</b> harpoon was adapted by Lewis Temple, using iron. <b>The</b> Temple <b>toggle</b> was widely used, and quickly came to dominate whaling.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>toggling</b> harpoon is {{an ancient}} weapon and tool used in whaling to impale a whale when thrown. Unlike earlier harpoon {{versions}} which had only one point, a toggling harpoon has a two-part point. One half of the point is firmly attached to the thrusting base, while {{the other half of}} the point is fitted over this first point like a cap and attached to the rest of the point with sinew or another string-like material. When the harpoon is thrust into an animal, the top half of the point detaches and twists horizontally into the animal under the skin, making it virtually impossible to pull the rest of the attached harpoon out of the animal while pulling it back to ship or shore. This harpoon technology lodges <b>the</b> <b>toggling</b> head of <b>the</b> harpoon underneath both the animal's skin and blubber, and instead lodges the point in the muscle, which also prevents the harpoon slipping out.|$|R
