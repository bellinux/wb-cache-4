The end of the Cold War, <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, and the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact obliged the first Bush Administration to reevaluate the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) purpose and makeup. Cheney believed that NATO should remain the foundation of European security relationships and that it would remain important to the United States in the long term; he urged the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe.|$|E

5|$|In {{a seminar}} at the Woodrow Wilson Institute on May 20, 2009, {{and based on}} an {{extensive}} analysis of the Vassiliev notebooks taken from the KGB archives, John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr, and Alexander Vassiliev concluded that Oppenheimer never was involved in espionage for the Soviets. The KGB tried repeatedly to recruit him, but were never successful. Allegations that he had spied for the Soviets are unsupported, and in some instances, contradicted by voluminous KGB and Venona documentation released after <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. In addition, he had several persons removed from the Manhattan project who had sympathies to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet media {{frequently}} covered racial discrimination, financial crises, {{and unemployment}} in the United States, which were viewed as failings of the capitalist system that had been erased by communism. Lynchings of African Americans were seen as an embarrassing skeleton in the closet for the US, which the Soviets used {{as a form of}} rhetorical ammunition when reproached for their own economic and social failings. The phrase grew in usage in the 1960s during the Cold War. After <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in 1991, the phrase became widespread as a reference to Russian information-warfare tactics. Its use subsequently became widespread in Russia to criticize any form of U.S. policy.|$|E

When Dimitri Orlov died in 1911 while building a railroad in the Russian Far East, his widow, left with five children, had to sell off the house to pay her family's debts. In 1983, renovation works were started on {{the building}} to convert it into a hotel. Since <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in 1991, various reconstruction works have been largely unsuccessful.

The same year, with the reorganization of the Air Force, the wing was reassigned from the disbanding Tactical Air Command to the newly formed Air Combat Command. In July 1993, the wing deployed 50 personnel from the 102d Civil Engineering Squadron under field conditions, to the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas. They helped rebuild schools and municipal facilities damaged by Hurricane Andrew.|$|E
5|$|Wolf populations {{throughout}} Northern and Central Asia {{are largely}} unknown, but are estimated {{in the hundreds}} of thousands based on annual harvests.

In China and Mongolia, wolves are only protected in reserves. Mongolian populations have been estimated at 10,000–30,000, while the status of wolves in China is more fragmentary. The north has a declining population of an estimated 400 wolves, while Xinjiang and Tibet hold about 10,000 and 2,000 respectively.|$|E

5|$|Berlin {{surrendered}} on 2 May. Records in the Soviet archives obtained after <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union {{state that}} the remains of Hitler, Braun, Joseph and Magda Goebbels, the six Goebbels children, General Hans Krebs, and Hitler's dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed. On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the SMERSH facility in Magdeburg. The remains from the boxes were burned, crushed, and scattered into the Biederitz river, {{a tributary of the}} Elbe. According to Kershaw, the corpses of Braun and Hitler were fully burned when the Red Army found them, and only a lower jaw with dental work could be identified as Hitler's remains.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, {{there was a}} growing number of intellectuals (Samir Kassir, Ziad Majed, Elias Khoury) and a network of {{independent}} student groups ("Independent Leftist Groups") who advocated democracy, individual liberties, secularism and center-left economic policies in Lebanon. On the other hand, a growing number Lebanese Communist Party (LCP) members were dissatisfied with the status of their party: the rise of Islamic Fundamentalism, <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, and the failure of the LCP to assume a more democratic socialist platform ushered in an era of political decline for the party. This, coupled with perceived Syrian domination of its leadership, led to increasing frustration among rank-and-file communists against the upper echelons of the party.|$|E
5|$|Following the Soviet {{occupation}} of Latvia in 1940 Latvia was annexed by the Soviet Union and the Freedom Monument was considered for demolition, but no such move was carried out. Soviet sculptor Vera Mukhina is sometimes credited for rescuing the monument, because she considered {{it to be}} of high artistic value. Soviet propaganda attempted to alter the symbolic meaning of the monument to better fit with Communist ideology, but it remained a symbol of national independence to the general public. Indeed, on June 14, 1987, about 5,000 people gathered at the monument to commemorate {{the victims of the}} Soviet regime and to lay flowers. This rally renewed the national independence movement, which culminated three years later in the re-establishment of Latvian sovereignty after <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> regime.|$|E

5|$|Nosaka {{attempted}} to brand the JCP as a populist party supporting Japan's peaceful transition into socialism, but his strategy was criticized {{within the party}} and within the Soviet Union. During the Korean War the JCP temporarily endorsed violence, and Nosaka disappeared from public life and went underground. He re-emerged to lead the JCP again in 1955, after which he {{attempted to}} disrupt the US-Japan Security Treaty by organizing public demonstrations, but he generally supported the JCP's role as a peaceful party. In 1958 Nosaka became Chairman of the JCP, a position he held until retirement {{at the age of}} 90, after which he was declared Honorary Chairman. Nosaka joined the faculty of Keio University, and he was widely idolized among left-wing intellectuals until shortly before his death, when <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union exposed controversial aspects of his relationship with Stalin's Communist regime.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 war was {{the first}} time since <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union that the Russian {{military}} had been used against an independent state, demonstrating Russia's willingness to wage a full-scale military campaign to attain its political objectives. The failure of the Western security system to respond swiftly to Russia's attempt to forcibly revise the borders of an OSCE member country revealed its weaknesses. The division between Western European and Eastern European nations also became apparent over the relations with Russia. Ukraine and other post-Soviet states received a clear message from the Russian leadership that the possible accession to NATO would cause a foreign invasion and the break-up of the country. Effective annexation of Abkhazia was also one of Russia's geopolitical goals. The construction of the EU-sponsored Nabucco pipeline connecting Central Asian reserves to Europe in Transcaucasia was averted.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, NASA planned {{to launch a}} modular space station called Freedom as a {{counterpart}} to Mir, while the Soviets were planning to construct Mir-2 in the 1990s {{as a replacement for}} the station. Because of budget and design constraints, Freedom never progressed past mock-ups and minor component tests and, with <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union {{and the end of the}} Space Race, the project was nearly cancelled entirely by the United States House of Representatives. The post-Soviet economic chaos in Russia also led to the cancellation of Mir-2, though only after its base block, DOS-8, had been constructed. Similar budgetary difficulties were faced by other nations with space station projects, which prompted the US government to negotiate with European states, Russia, Japan, and Canada in the early 1990s to begin a collaborative project. In June 1992, American president George H. W. Bush and Russian president Boris Yeltsin agreed to cooperate on space exploration. The resulting Agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes called for a short joint space programme with one American astronaut deployed to the Russian space station Mir and two Russian cosmonauts deployed to a Space Shuttle.|$|E
