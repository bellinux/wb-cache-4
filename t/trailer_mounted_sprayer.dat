Based on recorded increasing of average of heart rate, conventional knapsack sprayer {{was found to be}} most strenuous operation, with an increasing of average of hemi rate of 28. 13 beats /min. There were significant differences in the increasing of average of heart rates of batteries operated knapsack <b>sprayer</b> and tractor <b>mounted</b> <b>sprayer</b> (power sprayer) with the increasing of average of heart rates for these two field operations being 14. 63 and 17. 83 beats /min, respectively. There highest average of energy expenditure of 6. 90 kcal/ min was observed for conventional knapsack sprayer and the lowest average of energy expenditure of 3. 80 Kcal/ min was for tractor <b>mounted</b> <b>sprayer.</b> The highest field capacity was recorded for tractor <b>mounted</b> <b>sprayer</b> (Power Sprayer) was about 6. 77 acre per hour; while the lowest was recorded for conventional knapsack sprayer (manual) was about 1. 40 acre per hour. The results indicate that the average increasing of heart rate Beats / Min was positively linked to the human energy expenditure Kcal/ Min of the subjects, while the human energy expenditure Kcal / Min was negatively linked to the field capacity. In the operation cost, it indicate that the tractor <b>mounted</b> <b>sprayer</b> was highest that estimated of total operation cost was about RM 52. 621 hour, while the lowest was conventional knapsack sprayer (manual) that estimated to be RM 9. 08 /hour. This study demonstrated that usage of farm machinery for field operations was significantly different in human energy expenditure, field capacity, heart rate and operation cost...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Nowadays, {{the tractor}} <b>mounted</b> boom <b>sprayer</b> {{is used in}} many {{agricultural}} fields. These sprayers have many advantages compared to other sprayers, but in Iran, their field efficiency is much {{lower than that of}} the developed countries, because the tank volume and consumption of pesticides per hectare is often so highthat spraying per hectare takesa long time for handling the solutions and transporting the sprayers. Also spray droplet size is ordinarily high and its distribution is unknot uniform. So, often spraying and dropping top parts of plants on the earth is inevitable. According to studies carried out in the country during the years 2005 - 2008 in the agricultural research centers in several provinces such as Khuzestan, four types of <b>sprayers</b> including tractor <b>mounted</b> <b>sprayer,</b> atomizer, microner, and electrostatic atomizer were studied and some of the results obtained include the following. From {{the point of view of}} percentage of crash crop, tractor <b>mounted</b> <b>sprayer</b> has the highest percentage, but microner sprayer had the lowest. From the point of view of the solution of consumption amount and spraying cost per hectare, the operation of the tractor <b>mounted</b> <b>sprayer</b> and electrostatic sprayer had the highest and the lowest ranks, respectively. Atomizer sprayer had the highest effect on the percentage amount of weed control, but it requires a high amount of water consumption, high drift and low operation (Safari and Lovaimi, 2010). Materials and Methods: The experiment was carried out during 2012 - 2013 in the field of agricultural research located in the Mollasani city located 20 km near Ahvaz. In this study, tractor <b>mounted</b> spinning disk <b>sprayer</b> (<b>mounted</b> microner <b>sprayer)</b> was evaluated in comparison with conventional boom sprayer on weeds control. The treatments included medium (3500 rpm) and low (2000 rpm) speed rotation disk sprayer and two types of nozzle in conventional boom sprayer. One of them was an Italian tee jet nozzle and the other one was flowage nozzle and they were compared with control treatment. Experiment design was Randomized Completed blocks Design (RCBD) with seven replications. Parameters such as spraying quality, diameter, volume mean diameter and numerical mean of droplets, spray quality factor, the percentage of crash crop, weeds dry weight and number, percentage of weed control and the drift were measured. The results were compared with a control treatment. For comparative tests between the sprayers, the measured parameters were compared with each other using SAS software. Results and Discussion: Volume mean diameter and numerical mean diameter in tractor <b>mounted</b> microner <b>sprayer</b> with medium and low speed rotation disk treatment and also tractor <b>mounted</b> boom <b>sprayer</b> with Italian fan nozzle treatment were metered 162. 5, 461 and 635. 5 micron, and 138. 5, 355 and 452. 5 micron, respectively. Volume mean diameter related to numerical mean diameter was obtained to be 1. 17 and 1. 3 for tractor <b>mounted</b> microner <b>sprayer</b> with medium and low levels of speed rotation disk, and 1. 4 for tractor <b>mounted</b> boom <b>sprayer</b> with Italian fan nozzle, respectively. Whenever the spray quality coefficient is closer to one, the spray quality is better. So microner sprayer treatment with 1. 17 coefficient has the best spray quality. The results about weeds control numbers showed all treatments had significant difference with control treat in 1...|$|R

40|$|Chemical {{products}} for crop protection are usually distributed {{on the field}} as liquids by field sprayers. wanted horizontal and vertical sprayer boom movements create local under- and over-applications of spray liquid. A non-linear finite element model of a tractor and a <b>mounted</b> <b>sprayer</b> is developed to simulate these unwanted boom vibrations during field operations. Representative disturbance signals at the hitch point of the boom suspension are calculated for a tractor with a <b>mounted</b> <b>sprayer</b> driving over a standardized bumpy track. These disturbances are applied as input excitations to simulate boom movements for several types of suspensions (pendulum, single and double trapezium). Validation experiments with a simple 12 m boom on a hydraulic test rig indicate that this non-linear finite element modelling technique is a promising method for simulating boom movements of field sprayers. Further simulation {{results show that the}} modelled suspensions approximately halve the vertical motion of the boom compared with a rigidly mounted boom. Standard deviations of the vertical boom tip movements around the equilibrium position are, respectively, 0. 44, 0. 25 and 0. 27 m for a fixed boom, a boom with pendulum suspension and a boom with trapezium suspension. This proves the effectiveness of existing vertical boom suspensions. (C) 1999 Silsoe Research Institute. status: publishe...|$|R
