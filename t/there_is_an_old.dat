5|$|The {{story of}} Snow starts when Kanata Izumo, the main protagonist, revisits {{a small village}} called , to help manage a local hotel with hot springs {{alongside}} his cousin Tsugumi. In the village, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> legend: In ancient times, Ryūjinmura was protected by the dragon goddess. However, one day the goddess {{fell in love with}} a human, which is strictly forbidden, and this incident caused the village to be always covered by snow after that. The game then tells the daily life of Kanata interacting with the village girls, and ultimately links the story to the legend. Snow follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.|$|E
5|$|Melbourne {{is a town}} in South Derbyshire {{close to}} the River Trent, which may have {{originated}} as buildings associated with the royal manor {{to the south of}} the nearby settlement at Kings Newton. Melbourne Castle was constructed on the site of an earlier manor house of unknown date; <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> tradition that the manor was originally established in about the year 900, during the reign of Alfred the Great, but there is no evidence for this. As recorded in the Domesday Book, the manor of Melbourne and its lands were the property of King Edward the Confessor prior to the Norman Conquest. The property then passed into the hands of William I of England. After creating the Diocese of Carlisle in 1133, Henry I gave the manor for life to Æthelwold, the first bishop. Some time later, the diocese built a palace nearby on the site of what is now Melbourne Hall. When Bishop Æthelwold died in about 1156, the manor reverted to the crown.|$|E

25|$|The {{features}} that became Niagara Falls {{were created by}} the Wisconsin glaciation about 10,000 years ago. The same forces also created the North American Great Lakes and the Niagara River. All were dug by a continental ice sheet that drove through the area, deepening some river channels to form lakes, and damming others with debris. Scientists argue <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> valley, St David's Buried Gorge, buried by glacial drift, at the approximate location of the present Welland Canal.|$|E

Since 1983 {{it has been a}} location of an artistic colony, occupied by the painters and sculptors. In the 1980s the venue organized many artistic exhibitions. After the 2006 floods a project of reconstruction of the embankment to prevent the flooding was introduced. The embankment, which was to prevent 25 Renney water wells from being flooded, passes right through the bath building which was to be demolished so that this gap in the embankment can be filled. The gap, which is considered the weakest section of the entire embankment system on the island is just [...] from the Partizan settlement. Next to the building is the parking for the communal vehicles used for the works on Ada. In 2011, the management ordered the artists to move out. As of 2017, the building still stands.|$|E
2500|$|Three stone cottages and a forge used {{to stand}} in front of the church; these were {{demolished}} in 1970 and the stone was re-used to build the church's present car-park wall. The gateposts leading from the car-park to the churchyard were once reputedly the posts for the original village stocks, which have been replaced with a replica. The churchyard was enlarged by half an acre on the south side with land given by Eliza Bentley in 1868. Near the south entrance <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> sundial-base, which once said, [...] "PB 1675, Redime Tempus", referring to St Paul in Ephesians V.16: [...] "redeeming the time, because the days are evil".

2500|$|Settlers from Britain and Ireland {{arrived in}} Appalachia during the 18th century, and {{brought with them}} the musical traditions of their homelands. These traditions {{consisted}} primarily of English and Scottish ballads—which were essentially unaccompanied narrative—and dance music, such as Irish reels, which were accompanied by a fiddle. [...] Many older bluegrass songs come directly from the British Isles. Several Appalachian bluegrass ballads, such as [...] "Pretty Saro", [...] "Cuckoo Bird" [...] and [...] "House Carpenter", come from England and preserve the English ballad tradition both melodically and lyrically. [...] Others, such as The Two Sisters, also come from England; however, the lyrics are about Ireland. [...] Some bluegrass fiddle songs popular in Appalachia, such as [...] "Leather Britches", and [...] "Pretty Polly", have Scottish roots. [...] The dance tune Cumberland Gap may be derived from the tune that accompanies the Scottish ballad Bonnie George Campbell. Other songs have different names in different places; for instance in England <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> ballad known as [...] "A Brisk Young Sailor Courted Me", but exactly the same song in North American bluegrass is known as [...] "I Wish My Baby Was Born".|$|E
