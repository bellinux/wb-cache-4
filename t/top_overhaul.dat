It {{may or may not}} include a valve job. A major overhaul however covers the whole engine assembly, which requires the engine to be removed from the vehicle and transferred to an engine stand. An overhauled engine refers to a major overhaul. By comparison, a major overhaul costs more than a <b>top</b> <b>overhaul.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Todorov {{signed for}} Portsmouth in March 2002 for Â£750,000, joining {{director}} of football, Harry Redknapp, who had signed him for West Ham; Redknapp described him as, [...] "...a very intelligent footballer who will bring good {{competition in the}} striking department." [...] He was sent off for violent conduct in his second appearance for Portsmouth in a 2-0 defeat away at Preston and made only one further appearance in the 2001-02 season. He became a regular in the first team in the 2002-03 season, making 45 league appearances and scoring 26 goals, including a hat-trick in {{the final game of}} the season against Bradford City, as Portsmouth won the Football League First Division championship and were promoted to the Premier League. He was the First Division's <b>top</b> scorer, <b>overhauling</b> Nottingham Forest's David Johnson with his hat-trick {{on the final day of}} the season; Redknapp said, [...] "Todorov has had a great season. He is leading scorer in the First Division after today's goals. I bought him from my old club West Ham and he got a lot of stick at first... He has done marvellously, proving what a great player he is." [...] Todorov signed a new three-year contract with Portsmouth in July 2003.|$|R
