5|$|The {{efficacy}} of chemical pesticides tends to diminish over time. This is because any organism <b>that</b> <b>manages</b> {{to survive the}} initial application will pass on its genes to its offspring and a resistant strain will be developed. In this way, {{some of the most}} serious pests have developed resistance and are no longer killed by pesticides that used to kill their ancestors. This necessitates higher concentrations of chemical, more frequent applications and a movement to more expensive formulations.|$|E

A Local Government Council exists {{for each of}} these seats <b>that</b> <b>manages</b> sectors including primary education and health; an elected Executive Chairman and a group of elected Councillors form the Local Government Council that heads each Local Government Area.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} answer three {{research}} questions: (1) What, if any, issues are {{posed by the}} phenomenon of anthropogenic climate change for major Australian sport stadia (MASS) and the organisations <b>that</b> <b>manage</b> them?; (2) How are the organisations <b>that</b> <b>manage</b> major Australian sport stadia responding to climate change?, and; (3) Why are the organisations <b>that</b> <b>manage</b> major Australian sport stadia responding to climate {{change in the way}} they do? Although previous management and sport management research have examined a range of environmental and some climate change issues, {{there has not been a}} study of the implications of climate change for major sport stadia – or the organisations <b>that</b> <b>manage</b> them – in Australia, or overseas. Although some management studies have identified climate change specifically as an important problem, little attention has been paid to its physical impacts on sport, and none have considered potential impacts on major sport stadia, or the regulatory and commercial impacts on the organisations <b>that</b> <b>manage</b> them. Equally, few previous studies have examined how sport organisations interpret climate change, contribute to it by way of the direct or indirect generation of greenhouse gas emissions, or respond to its various impacts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Knowledge {{management}} systems (KMS) are increasingly becoming popular and important in managing organizational knowledge. This motivates a closer {{inspection of the}} degree of usability of various types of KMS. This paper is an analysis of KMS from a philosophical angle: with the help of veritistic social epistemology we analyze which KMS are likely to be used more in comparison to others. Veritistic social epistemology is oriented towards truth determination; it seeks to evaluate actual and prospective multi-person practices in terms of their tendency to produce true beliefs (versus false beliefs or no belief) in their users. We distinguish between KMS <b>that</b> <b>manage</b> structured knowledge and those <b>that</b> <b>manage</b> unstructured knowledge. It is argued that structured knowledge is more credible to the users than unstructured knowledge and that, because of this, KMS <b>that</b> <b>manage</b> structured knowledge bring more veritistic gains than those <b>that</b> <b>manage</b> unstructured knowledge. ...|$|R
