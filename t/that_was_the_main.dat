5|$|An {{important}} {{landmark in}} Fleet Street {{during the late}} Middle Ages was a conduit <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> water supply for the area. When Anne Boleyn was crowned Queen following her marriage to Henry VIII in 1533, the conduit flowed wine instead of water. By the 16th century, Fleet Street, along {{with much of the}} City, was chronically overcrowded, and a Royal proclamation in 1580 banned any further building on the street. This had little effect, and construction continued, particularly timber. Prince Henry's Room over the Inner Temple gate dates from 1610 and is named after Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, eldest son of James I, who did not survive to succeed his father.|$|E

25|$|Erhard Milch, {{responsible}} for production, warned the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German High Command or OKW) that the Soviet Union {{could not be}} defeated in 1941. He called for winter preparations and increases in production in the expectation {{the war in the}} East, even if successful, would last several years. Joseph Schmid, senior intelligence officer and Otto Hoffmann von Waldau, Luftwaffe chief of operations, were also opposed to Barbarossa. Schmid still felt the Luftwaffe could defeat Britain by attacking its industries, while Waldau argued that dissipating German air strength along a wide ‘air front’ was deeply irresponsible. Waldau's continuing realism and non-concealed criticism of the Luftwaffe leadership and its prosecution of the war, led him to being removed from his post in 1942. Milch’s skepticism soon became despair. He convinced himself a war in the East would be a disaster, and did everything he could to influence Göring to persuade Hitler not go ahead with Barbarossa. Initially, Göring kept his word, and argued that pursuing a strategy in the Mediterranean Theatre of Operations, particularly in conjunction with the Regia Marina (Italian Navy) against Gibraltar, while weakening the British hold on the eastern Mediterranean would be the most ideal strategy. Hitler dismissed this. Hitler also dismissed the Kriegsmarine’s objections that it was the British and their shipping lanes <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> enemy.|$|E
25|$|Codreanu {{had to go}} into hiding, {{waiting for}} things to calm down and delegating {{leadership}} to General Gheorghe Cantacuzino-Grănicerul, who later assumed partial guilt for Duca's killing; Stelescu, who soon became Codreanu's adversary as head of the Crusade of Romanianism, later alleged that he had been given refuge by a cousin of Magda Lupescu, Carol's mistress, implying that the Guard was becoming corrupt ("She was a person adverse to your action. How did you get along so well?"). Codreanu's resurgence brought arrest and prosecution under the martial law imposed in the country; he was acquitted yet again. Despite Codreanu's attacks on the elite as hopelessly corrupt and self-serving, at his trial in 1934 a number of respected politicians like Gheorghe I. Brătianu, Alexandru Vaida-Voevod and Constantin Argetoianu testified for Codreanu as character witnesses. The Iron Guard did have some links to the Nazi Party's foreign office under Alfred Rosenberg, but in 1933–34 the Romanian fascist <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> beneficiary of financial support from Rosenberg was Codreanu's rival Octavian Goga who lacked Codreanu's mass following and thus was more biddable. A further issue for the Nazis was concern over Codreanu's statements that Romania had too many minorities for its own good, which led to fears that Codreanu might persecute the volksdeutsch minority if he came to power. But the connections between the NSDAP and the Iron Guard, as limited as they were, did add to the Legion's appeal as the Iron Guard was associated in the public mind with the apparently dynamic and successful society of Nazi Germany.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{views on}} the shapes and connectivity of atoms was that proposed by Leucippus, Democritus, and Epicurus who reasoned that the solidness of the material corresponded {{to the shape of}} the atoms involved. [...] Thus, iron atoms are solid and strong with hooks that lock them into a solid; water atoms are smooth and slippery; salt atoms, because of their taste, are sharp and pointed; and air atoms are light and whirling, pervading all other materials. [...] It was Democritus <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> proponent of this view. [...] Using analogies based on the experiences of the senses, he gave a picture or an image of an atom in which atoms were distinguished from each other by their shape, their size, and the arrangement of their parts. [...] Moreover, connections were explained by material links in which single atoms were supplied with attachments: some with hooks and eyes others with balls and sockets (see diagram).|$|E
500|$|The costumes for {{the tour}} were created by {{designer}} Arianne Phillips. Before the show started, USA Today reported that Madonna would be making five costume changes in the tour. Phillips commented that since Madonna was revisiting her old songs for this tour, hence <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> philosophy and inspiration behind designing the costumes. However she also noted that [...] "Madonna has always pooh-poohed the concept of reinvention and doesn't strategize or premeditate her new look in a boardroom, {{so this is the}} greatest ironic statement of all." [...] The T-shirts were designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier and the shoes used were provided by clothing line hosiery Miu Miu. The opening dress was created by French designer Christian Lacroix and incorporated the baroque look. The second part of the displayed military themed outfits inspired from the American Life album and designed by Phillips. The third ensemble emphasized on the emotional point of the show and hence the costumes were quieter and displayed the silhouettes of the performers. The costumes of this segment were designed by Stella McCartney. Phase four costumes, inspired by the carnivals, were designed by Chanel. The final segment of the tour displayed traditional dresses. Other than these, Madonna wore corsets during the first segment.|$|E

After the match both members of No Limit had their heads shaved completely bald per lucha libre traditions. On February 14, 2010 Texano Jr. and Terrible travelled to Japan to challenge No Limit for the IWGP Tag Team Championship, {{but were not}} able to defeat No Limit in their home country. By virtue of holding the NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship El Texano Jr. participated in the 2010 Universal Championship tournament. He was part of [...] "Block A" [...] that competed on the July 30, 2010 Super Viernes show. He co-won the eight-man seeding battle royal, and then won his first round match by defeating Ephesto. The second round was a rematch from the previous year's tournament, only this time La Sombra eliminated El Texano Jr. and not vice versa. On August 12, 2010, El Texano Jr.'s NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship was replaced with the new NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship after CMLL had received complaints from the National Wrestling Alliance. In October and November 2010, El Texano Jr. and El Terrible took part in New Japan's 2010 G1 Tag League. After victories over Takashi Iizuka and Toru Yano and No Limit, Texano Jr. and Terrible finished fifth in their block and didn't advance to the semifinals of the tournament. On December 14, 2010, El Texano Jr. lost the NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship to Shocker. Texano Jr. and El Terrible defeated the father/son team of Brazo de Plata and Máximo in the main event of the 2011 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas ("Homage to Two Legends") show, forcing La Dinastia Alvarado (Brazo de Plata and Máximo) both to have their heads shaved bald..

2500|$|No Limit {{made their}} debut for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) in Mexico City, Mexico on May 29, 2009 teaming with Dos Caras, Jr. to defeat Héctor Garza, La Sombra and Volador, Jr.. No Limit were {{presented}} as [...] "Anti-Mexican" [...] heels ("bad guys") and soon began teaming with Okumura {{under the name}} La Ola Amarilla (Spanish for [...] "The Yellow Wave") in matches against Mexicans. On July 10, 2009 No Limit teamed with Black Warrior to defeat the team of Héctor Garza, Toscano and El Sagrado, After the match Black Warrior made a challenge on behalf of Yujiro [...] (as Yujiro does not speak Spanish) for a [...] "hair vs. hair" [...] match with Garza. This led to all men being involved in a 15-man steel cage Luchas de Apuestas match at Infierno en el Ring that Naito won by pinning Toscano, forcing him to have his hair shaved off. Following the match No Limit's focus was on Black Warrior, who had turned on them during the cage match. When Jushin Thunder Liger toured Mexico in September, 2009 he joined the [...] "Anti-Mexico" [...] faction, teaming with No Limit and Okumura to defeat Team Mexico (Último Guerrero, Atlantis, Black Warrior and Héctor Garza) at the CMLL 76th Anniversary Show on September 18, 2009. The following week Yujio teamed with Okumura to win the 2009 Gran Alternativa tournament, defeating Toscano and Rouge in the first round, Héctor Garza and Ángel de Plata {{in the second round}} and Místico and Ángel de Oro in the finals. The storyline feud between No Limit and Black Warrior reached its conclusion on October 16, 2009 as Black Warrior faced Yujiro in a Lucha de Apuesta, hair vs. hair match that Yujiro won two falls to one, forcing Black Warrior to have his hair shaved off after the match. After the storyline with Black Warrior ended No Limit began working with the team of El Texano, Jr. and El Terrible in a feud that led to a Lucha de Apuesta hair vs. hair match between the two teams <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> event of CMLL's Sin Salida show on December 4, 2009.

2500|$|One of {{the main}} storylines of 2014 for CMLL was the {{emergence}} of Los Ingobernables ("The Ungovernable" [...] or [...] "The Unruly") as a team, a storyline that had driven the main event of CMLL's two previous major shows Juicio Final and Homenaje a Dos Leyendas. The storyline stretched back into 2013 where the rudo Negro Casas began a rivalry with the tecnico Rush, a tecnico that worked a rougher, harder style and often experienced that the fans would boo him during his matches. By the end of 2013 the storyline began to also include Shocker, who turned rudo and sided with Casas in the feud. The storyline evolved over time and Rush, Casa and Shocker all agreed to a three-way match under Lucha de Apuestas ("Bet match") rules where the loser would be shaved bald. Later on Negro Casas {{dropped out of the}} match, declaring that he would rather face the winner and let Rush and Shocker fight each other at the 2014 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show. Rush defeated Shocker, forcing Shocker to be shaved bald after the event and immediately set his sights on Negro Casas. While Rush had displayed less of a tecnico attitude during his matches against especially Shocker and Casas he never turned rudo as such. Following the Homenaje show Rush began teaming more and more with La Sombra, who was also displaying a more rudo attitude, announing themselves as [...] "técnicos diferentes" [...] ("A different kind of good guy"). Soon after they were joined by La Máscara, to become a trio known as Los Indeseables ("The Undesirables"), later renamed Ingobernables ("Ungovernables"). Rush and La Máscara held the CMLL World Tag Team Championship {{at the time of the}} Ingorbernables creation, but would later lost the title to Negro Casas and Shocker. Following the title loss the focal point became a Luchas de Apuestas match between Rush and Negro Casas <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> event of the 2014 Juicio Final show, a match that Rush won by underhanded means, forcing Negro Casas to be shaved bald. Following Juicio Final Los Ingorbernables became positioned to challenge La Peste Negra (Casas, El Felino and Mr. Niebla) for the Mexican National Trios Championship, but on September 6, 2014 CMLL announced that Rush and La Mascara would challenge Negro Casas and Shocker for the CMLL World Tag Team Championship as part of the 81st Anniversary show.|$|E
2500|$|Los Invasores {{featured}} {{in four of}} the six matches at CMLL's 2010 Sin Salida show. The following month the Promociones Gutiérrez 1st Anniversary Show featured a series of [...] "CMLL vs. outsiders" [...] matches, some featuring fully fledged Los Invasores members and some featuring wrestlers who did not regularly work for CMLL making a special appearance. One of the wrestlers who had not worked for CMLL up until that point was Charly Manson, who would parlay his appearance at the anniversary show into a full-time contract with CMLL as part of Los Invasores. The main event was a 5 team Ruleta de la Muerte elimination match that came down to Místico and El Oriental (representing Los Invasores) wrestling in a Lucha de Apuestas, mask vs. mask match which Místico won, forcing El Oriental to unmask. Over the summer of 2010 Psicosis II began to develop a feud with Místico, which was used as the driving force behind booking a 14-man steel cage Lucha de Apuesta match <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> event of the CMLL 77th Anniversary Show on September 4, 2010. El Alebrije, Histeria, Olímpico and Psicosis represented Los Invasores in the cage. The unmasked members of Los Invasores, specially Mr. Águila, Garza, Manson and El Oriental began a feud with La Peste Negra, which quickly led to a Lucha de Apuesta, a hair vs. hair match. The 14-man steel cage saw Histeria and El Alebrije leave the cage in the early parts of the match and Psicosis II escaping the cage as the 12th and las tman, all keeping their masks safe. The match came down to La Sombra pinning Olímpico to unmask him. In the weeks following the 77th Anniversary show Negro Casas and the rest of La Peste Negra ("The Black Plague") began to face off against various Invasores trios, oftentimes across from Charly Manson. During those matches the storyline that emerged was the personal rivalry between Casas and Los Invasores newest member Charly Manson, one that often saw Los Invasores either cheat to win or get intentionally disqualified as they attacked Casas. After several weeks of fighting Casas laid out a challenge to Manson for him to [...] "bet" [...] his hair on a Lucha de Apuestas between the two, a challenge Manson accepted, noting that he had never lost a Luchas de Apuestas match in his career.|$|E
