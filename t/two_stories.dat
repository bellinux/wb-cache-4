5|$|The main {{building}} designed by Lange is in historicism and was originally built in <b>two</b> <b>stories</b> in brick. A third was {{added in the}} 1950s, some {{with some of the}} original feel being lost in the addition, since it was not stylistically true. In 1965 two annexes were built, one on each side and in <b>two</b> <b>stories.</b> The western was used for offices and the other as part of the waiting area—these were both in line with the historicist style. They replaced a cargo expedition and a restaurant building, respectively. In 1995 the bus station was moved from the city center at Leüthenhaven to the central station, and the eastern annex was razed in favor of a postmodernistic glass and concrete building. In addition to the bus station it features and extension of the waiting area, offices, a restaurant and a parking lot.|$|E

Then, they planned the story on whiteboard.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} pilot, Miller {{structured}} each episode by telling <b>two</b> <b>stories</b> in the episode. The {{first was a}} traditional procedural plotline. The second story was a flashback from Henry's past.
