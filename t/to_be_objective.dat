25|$|To begin with, Kant's {{distinction}} between the a posteriori being contingent and particular knowledge, and the a priori being universal and necessary knowledge, must be kept in mind. For if we merely connect two intuitions together in a perceiving subject, the knowledge is always subjective because it is derived a posteriori, when what is desired is for the knowledge <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>objective,</b> that is, for the two intuitions {{to refer to the}} object and hold good of it necessarily universally for anyone at any time, not just the perceiving subject in its current condition. What else is equivalent to objective knowledge besides the a priori, that is to say, universal and necessary knowledge? Nothing else, and hence before knowledge can be objective, it must be incorporated under an a priori category of the understanding.|$|E
25|$|Although Kant {{considered}} {{these two}} interests of reason <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>objective</b> and universal, {{the distinction between}} the natural and human sciences was institutionalized in Germany, through the organization of scholarly research and teaching, following the Enlightenment. In Germany the Enlightenment was dominated by Kant himself, who sought to establish principles based on universal rationality. In reaction to Kant, German scholars such as Johann Gottfried Herder (an influence to Boas) argued that human creativity, which necessarily takes unpredictable and highly diverse forms, is as important as human rationality. In 1795, the great linguist and philosopher Wilhelm von Humboldt called for an anthropology that would synthesize Kant's and Herder's interests. Humboldt founded the University of Berlin in 1809, and his work in geography, history, and psychology provided the milieu in which Boas's intellectual orientation matured.|$|E

500|$|Friedman's essay [...] "The Methodology of Positive Economics" [...] (1953) {{provided}} the epistemological pattern {{for his own}} subsequent research and {{to a degree that}} of the Chicago School. There he argued that economics as science should be free of value judgments for it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>objective.</b> Moreover, a useful economic theory should be judged not by its descriptive realism but by its simplicity and fruitfulness as an engine of prediction. That is, students should measure the accuracy of its predictions, rather than the 'soundness of its assumptions'. His argument was part of an ongoing debate among such statisticians as Jerzy Neyman, Leonard Savage, and Ronald Fisher.|$|E

Given Bartley's previous work, Lieberson stated, he might have made an ideal interpreter of Erhard, but he found this expectation [...] "disappointed [...] the book is nevertheless instructive". A review of Werner Erhard in Kirkus Reviews similarly concluded, [...] "Too entranced to be truly objective, Bartley is nonetheless an insightfully partial observer." [...] Booklist stated that Bartley, as an est student, had made the [...] "mistake of being too close to his subject <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>objective</b> or critical." ...|$|E

I added that I would rather lose a match in America than win one in England. But after having carefully considered the subject in all its bearings, I {{have come to the conclusion}} that I neither mean to die yet nor to lose the match." [...] At a joint simultaneous display in Russia around the time of the 1895â€“96 Saint Petersburg tournament, Emanuel Lasker and Steinitz formed an impromptu comedy double act.|$|E
500|$|Glosserman and {{the rest}} of the {{production}} team met together to put together a focus for the film; they centered their efforts on answering the question: [...] "How does Wikipedia get at the truth?" [...] They also wanted to provide information for everyday individuals wanting to know about Wikipedia's background and functioning. Experts were sought out, including the author of The Age of American Unreason Susan Jacoby, to discuss Wikipedia's approach to scholars knowledgeable about specific subject matter. Glosserman commented in an interview with IndieWire, [...] "We tried to get people offering compelling arguments for either side of any particular topic because our intention was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>objective</b> and to let the viewer make up his or her own mind." [...] The narrative structure of the film What the Bleep Do We Know!? served as an inspiration for Glosserman during the production process. As a non-profit project, the film had received more than $55,000 in donations by March 2009.|$|E

2500|$|John Thelwall, {{a democrat}} and radical, was upset by his belief that Burke assumed that {{only a portion of}} the population, the {{informed}} individuals, should be understood as the public. Thelwall also opposed Burke's descriptions of British Jacobins and believed that Burke wanted to legalize their execution. James Mackintosh believed that Burke had a strong linguistic power and agreed that war could be necessary but not with France. To restore the French monarchy, to Mackintosh, would go against France's right as a nation and remove its independence. [...] The only way for the opponents of France to do what is right is for them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>objective</b> and balanced. William Roscoe, a Unitarian liberal, believed that Burke misunderstood the French revolution and that the British were the aggressors in the situation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{differences}} between these interpretations are rather small, and may seem inconsequential. One of the main points of disagreement lies in the relation between probability and belief. [...] Logical probabilities are conceived (for example in Keynes' Treatise on Probability) <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>objective,</b> logical relations between propositions (or sentences), and hence not to depend in any way upon belief. [...] They are degrees of (partial) entailment, or degrees of logical consequence, not degrees of belief. [...] (They do, nevertheless, dictate proper degrees of belief, as is discussed below.) [...] Frank P. Ramsey, on the other hand, was skeptical {{about the existence of}} such objective logical relations and argued that (evidential) probability is [...] "the logic of partial belief". (p 157) [...] In other words, Ramsey held that epistemic probabilities simply are degrees of rational belief, rather than being logical relations that merely constrain degrees of rational belief.|$|E

2500|$|Goldstone {{dismissed}} {{accusations of}} anti-Israel bias {{in his report}} as [...] "ridiculous" [...] and invited [...] "fair minded people" [...] to read the report and [...] "at the end of it, point out where it failed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>objective</b> or even-handed". Speaking in the UNHRC, Goldstone rejected {{what he called a}} [...] "barrage of criticism" [...] about his findings and said the answers to such criticism are in the findings of the report. Goldstone said that the United States, for example, had failed to substantiate its charges that the report was biased. In an interview with Al Jazeera, Goldstone challenged the Obama administration to identify the flaws the U.S. said it has found in the report. Alan Dershowitz in his analyses of the Report responded that as of January 2010 Goldstone had generally refused to reply substantively to credible critics of the Report and declined Dershowitz's offer to publicly debate Goldstone about its contents. Goldstone referred to his experiences of South Africa to reject Israeli PM Netanyahu's arguments that the report would make peacemaking more difficult, saying, [...] "truth-telling and acknowledgement to victims can be a very important assistance to peace." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hughes wanted {{young black}} writers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>objective</b> about their race, {{but not to}} scorn it or flee it. He {{understood}} the main points of the Black Power movement of the 1960s, but believed {{that some of the}} younger black writers who supported it were too angry in their work. Hughes's work Panther and the Lash, posthumously published in 1967, was intended to show solidarity with these writers, but with more skill and devoid of the most virulent anger and racial chauvinism some showed toward whites. Hughes continued to have admirers among the larger younger generation of black writers. He often helped writers by offering advice and introducing them to other influential persons in the literature and publishing communities. This latter group, including Alice Walker, whom Hughes discovered, looked upon Hughes as a hero and an example to be emulated within their own work. One of these young black writers (Loften Mitchell) observed of Hughes: [...] "Langston set a tone, a standard of brotherhood and friendship and cooperation, {{for all of us to}} follow. You never got from him, 'I am the Negro writer,' but only 'I am a Negro writer.' He never stopped thinking about the rest of us." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the other}} state of semi-somnolence, while still alert enough {{to watch and}} reason on the phenomena, we occasionally, though less commonly, hear what may be called 'inner voices.' That is to say, we do not suppose that any one from without is {{speaking}} to us, but we hear, as it were, a voice within us making some remark, usually disjointed enough, and not suggested by any traceable train of thought {{of which we are}} conscious at the time. This experience partly enables us to understand the cases of sane persons who, when to all appearance wide awake, occasionally hear voices which appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>objective</b> and caused by actual vibrations of the atmosphere. I am acquainted with at least four persons, all of them healthy, and normal enough, who have had such experiences. In all four cases, the apparent voice (though the listeners have no superstitious belief on the subject) has communicated intelligence which proved to be correct. But in only one instance, I think, was the information thus communicated beyond the reach of conjecture, based perhaps on some observation unconsciously made or so little attended to when made that it could not be recalled by the ordinary memory.|$|E

60|$|First: I cannot {{think that}} he had to treat his own sacred books unfairly, to make them agree with the root-idea of Socrates and Plato. Socrates and Plato {{acknowledged}} a Divine teacher of the human spirit; that was the ground of their philosophy. So did the literature of the Jews. Socrates and Plato, with all the Greek sages till the Sophistic era, held that the object of philosophy was the search after that which truly exists: that he who found that, found wisdom: Philo's books taught him the same truth: but they taught him also, that the search for wisdom was not merely the search for that which is, but for Him who is; not for a thing, but for a person. I do not mean that Plato and the elder Greeks had not that object also in view; for I have said already that Theology was with them the ultimate object of all metaphysic science: but I do think that they saw it infinitely less clearly than the old Jewish sages. Those sages were utterly unable to conceive of an absolute truth, except as residing in an absolutely true person; of absolute wisdom, except in an absolutely wise person; of an absolute order and law, except in a lawgiver; of an absolute good, except in an absolutely good person: any more than either they or we can conceive of an absolute love, except in an absolutely loving person. I say boldly, that I think them right, on all grounds of Baconian induction. For all these qualities are only known to us as exhibited in persons; and if we believe them to have any absolute and eternal existence at all, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>objective,</b> and independent of us, and the momentary moods and sentiments of our own mind, they must exist in some absolute and eternal person, or they are mere notions, abstractions, words, which have no counterparts.|$|E
