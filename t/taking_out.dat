5|$|North Island's primary {{human use}} is as a {{seasonal}} camp for Western Rock Lobster fishers. During lobster season, which runs from 15 March to 30 June, North Island's camp {{is occupied by}} about 130 fishers. The camp is serviced by a carrier boat, the North Islander, which visits the island every three days, bringing supplies and <b>taking</b> <b>out</b> the catch and any domestic waste.|$|E
5|$|After fierce hand-to-hand combat, {{most of the}} Muslims {{managed to}} {{withdraw}} and regroup higher up {{on the slopes of}} Uhud. A small faction was cut off and tried to make its way back to Medina, though many of these were killed. The Meccans' chief offensive arm, its cavalry, was unable to ascend the slopes of Uhud in pursuit of the Muslims, and so the fighting ceased. Hind and her companions are said to have mutilated the Muslim corpses, cutting off their ears and noses and making the relics into anklets. Hind is reported to have cut open the corpse of Hamza, <b>taking</b> <b>out</b> his liver which she then attempted to eat. Abu Sufyan, after some brief verbal exchanges with Muhammad's companion, Umar (Umar ibn al-Khattab), decided to return to Mecca without pressing his advantage.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona responded quickly, as Carles Puyol found Eto'o {{with a long}} throw-in {{down the}} right wing. The Cameroonian then found Messi, who cut inside and hit a curling 25-yard shot that just shaved {{the top of the}} crossbar. A quick-passing move from United followed, {{culminating}} with a through-ball to Park in the inside right channel, only for Valdés to cut out the pass, <b>taking</b> <b>out</b> the South Korean in the process. The resulting throw-in eventually broke to Ronaldo, whose 30-yard shot went just wide. Valdés' clash with Park, however, left him requiring treatment, and although the injury was not sufficient to necessitate a substitution, Valdés chose to leave his next few goal kicks to Piqué.|$|E

5|$|Both {{character}} and actress received mixed reviews from critics throughout the series; Baxendale received the Best Actress {{award from the}} Broadcasting Press Guild for her portrayal of Rachel in the pilot and {{was nominated for a}} British Comedy Award. However, television reviewers criticised the character when the series began. Rachel's diagnosis with Asherman's syndrome in the fourth series drew criticism from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, which had been consulted during the writing of the storyline. When the series ended, there was a 20% {{increase in the number of}} people <b>taking</b> <b>out</b> life insurance policies with one provider, Tesco Personal Finance, which a spokesperson for the company attributed to Rachel's premature death.|$|E
5|$|First on the {{schedule}} were the scenes on the Madagascar building site, shot in the Bahamas {{on the site of}} a derelict hotel which Michael G. Wilson had become acquainted with in 1977 during the filming of The Spy Who Loved Me. In the scene, Bond drives a digger toward the building, slamming into the concrete plinth on which Mollaka is running. The stunt team built a model and put forward several ways in which the digger could conceivably take out the concrete, including <b>taking</b> <b>out</b> the pillar underneath. A section of the concrete wall was removed to fit the digger and reinforced with steel.|$|E
5|$|In {{multiple}} steps during 2012–2013, the ECB {{lowered its}} bank rate to historical lows, reaching 0.25% in November 2013. Soon after the rates were shaved to 0.15%, then on 4 September 2014 {{the central bank}} shocked financial markets by cutting the razor-thin rates by a further two thirds from 0.15% to 0.05%, the lowest on record. The moves were designed to make it cheaper for banks to borrow from the ECB, with the aim that lower cost of money would {{be passed on to}} businesses <b>taking</b> <b>out</b> loans, boosting investment in the economy. The lowered borrowing rates caused the euro to fall in relation to other currencies, which it was hoped would boost exports from the eurozone.|$|E

After his win in the 1960 elections he was flooded with calls and letters urging that Zeus be continued. This was a concentrated {{effort on the part of}} the Army, who fought back against similar Air Force tactics. They also deliberately spread the Zeus contracts over 37 states in order to gain as much political and industrial support as possible, while <b>taking</b> <b>out</b> advertisements in major mass-market magazines like Life and The Saturday Evening Post promoting the system.|$|E
5|$|Punk {{then used}} {{the group to}} attack Randy Orton, blaming him for prematurely ending Punk's first World Heavyweight Championship reign in 2008. Punk and The Nexus cost Orton his match with The Miz for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble in January 2011. Orton, in turn, responded by <b>taking</b> <b>out</b> all of the New Nexus members by punting them in the head, leaving Punk alone as the sole {{surviving}} member of the group. This led to a WrestleMania XXVII match and a Last Man Standing match at Extreme Rules, both of which Punk lost.|$|E
5|$|The finals system {{meant that}} they would have to play their finals match in England against English Super League club Wigan. The Mariners shocked the club and the league by winning 22–18. That score line would again be {{repeated}} in the grand final qualifier against Australian club Cronulla, another match the Mariners were expected to lose. But the Mariners were able to defeat the Australian Super League runners-up to take themselves to the grand final of the competition. Against the winners of the Super League grand final, Brisbane, the Mariners were blown away by the competition favourites. In what would be their final rugby league match as a club, the Mariners were down at half-time 26–4 and the final scoreline of 36–12 prevented the Mariners <b>taking</b> <b>out</b> a A$1 million prize.|$|E

5|$|The {{system was}} {{the topic of}} intense inter-service rivalry {{throughout}} its lifetime. When the ABM role {{was given to the}} Army in 1958, the United States Air Force began a long series of critiques on Zeus, both within defense circles and in the press. The Army returned these attacks in kind, <b>taking</b> <b>out</b> full page advertisements in popular mass market news magazines to promote Zeus, as well as spreading development contracts across many states in order to garner the maximum political support. As deployment neared in the early 1960s, the debate became a major political issue. The question ultimately became whether or not a system with limited effectiveness would be better than nothing at all.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his travels}} Marlborough {{remained}} {{in close contact}} with the Electoral court of Hanover, determined to ensure a bloodless Hanoverian succession on Anne's death. He also maintained correspondence with the Jacobites. The spirit of the age saw little wrong in Marlborough's continuing friendship with his nephew, the Duke of Berwick, James II's illegitimate son with Arabella. But these assurances against a Jacobite restoration (which he had been <b>taking</b> <b>out</b> since the early years of WilliamIII, no matter how insincere), stirred Hanoverian suspicions, and perhaps prevented him from holding the first place in the counsels of the future GeorgeI.|$|E
5|$|While searching a motel for supplies, L.J. is {{bitten by}} a zombie, which he keeps secret. The next morning the convoy is {{attacked}} by crows that had been feeding on the infected.

Alice finally appears and saves Carlos and the others from a fiery death, using her telekinesis to fill the sky with fire, killing the crows and leaving her unconscious. After recovering, Alice is introduced to Claire and gives her the diary she found, and she and Carlos then convince Claire to take her convoy to Alaska.|$|E

Doakes appears and asks him what he is doing, and after a fist fight, a foreman arrives and orders them to leave. Doakes tells Dexter that {{he knows that he}} is up to something, and says that he will be watching him. Meanwhile, Rita is contacted by an imprisoned Paul, who contends that Dexter knocked him out and set him up. Rita becomes annoyed as Paul persists that Dexter is dangerous and should not be around their children. Rita is visited by Paul's Narcotics Anonymous sponsor, who attempts to convince Rita that Paul is telling the truth. In a final plea, Paul calls Rita and tells her to search their house for a shoe which he believes came off when Dexter knocked him out. Rita hangs up, but discovers the shoe while <b>taking</b> <b>out</b> the trash {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E
5|$|Bradley {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of using nuclear weapons in Korea at a Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting on 9 July 1950 at Eisenhower's instigation, but there was no support for the idea. The Army staff sent a cable to Collins in Tokyo suggesting that he seek out MacArthur's opinion. In a teleconference on 13 July, Major General Charles L. Bolte proposed sending nuclear weapons. MacArthur had already turned down Air Force proposals to fire bomb North Korean cities, and suggested that atomic bombs could be used to isolate North Korea by <b>taking</b> <b>out</b> bridges and tunnels. The Army staff considered this impractical. However, on 28 July, the Joint Chiefs decided to send ten nuclear-capable B-29 bombers of the 9th Bombardment Wing to Guam as a deterrent to Chinese action against Taiwan. Truman publicly denied that he was considering the use of nuclear weapons in Korea, but authorised the transfer to Guam of atomic bombs without their fissile cores. The deployment did not go well; one of the bombers crashed on takeoff from Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base in California on 5 August, killing the mission commander, Brigadier General Robert F. Travis, and 18 others. The remaining nine bombers remained in Guam until 13 September, when they returned to the United States. The bomb assemblies stayed behind.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1826, the Canal Company had {{insufficient}} funds {{to complete the}} work, and a special meeting authorised the <b>taking</b> <b>out</b> of a mortgage to cover the £15,000 deficit. The canal was an obvious competitor to the River Tone Navigation, which was managed by the Conservators of the River Tone, a legal body created for that purpose by Act of Parliament in 1699. There was animosity between the Company and the Conservators, with the Company maintaining {{that they had a}} right to use the Tone to reach the centre of Taunton, and the Conservators maintaining that they did not. The canal was scheduled to be opened on 1 January 1827, but the opening was delayed until 3 January, as the connection to the River Tone was not made until 2 January. The opening celebrations were hampered by snow and bitter cold weather.|$|E
