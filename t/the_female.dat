5|$|After mating, <b>the</b> <b>female</b> washes her vulva thoroughly. If a male {{attempts}} {{to mate with}} her at this point, <b>the</b> <b>female</b> will attack him. After about 20 to 30 minutes, once <b>the</b> <b>female</b> is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{one year of}} age. The male mates with <b>the</b> <b>female</b> by swimming close to her with his head lowered and tail raised, continually whistling. If there {{is a group of}} males, they will chase <b>the</b> <b>female</b> in flight until only one drake is left. <b>The</b> <b>female</b> prepares for copulation, which takes place in the water, by lowering her body; the male then bobs his head up and down and mounts <b>the</b> <b>female,</b> taking the feathers {{on the back of her}} head in his mouth. After mating, he raises his head and back and whistles.|$|E
5|$|Females are {{generally}} attracted to males by their calls, though in nonstridulatory species, some other mechanism must be involved. After the pair has made antennal contact, a courtship period may occur {{during which the}} character of the call changes. <b>The</b> <b>female</b> mounts the male and a single spermatophore is transferred to the external genitalia of <b>the</b> <b>female.</b> Sperm flows from this into the female's oviduct over a period of a few minutes or up to an hour, depending on species. After copulation, <b>the</b> <b>female</b> may remove or eat the spermatophore; males may attempt to prevent this with various ritualised behaviours. <b>The</b> <b>female</b> may mate on several occasions with different males.|$|E
50|$|There {{is strong}} sexual dimorphism; the males are {{much larger than}} <b>the</b> <b>females.</b> <b>The</b> average male weighs around 10.5 kg and <b>the</b> <b>females</b> weigh around 7 kg.|$|R
50|$|Generally {{the males}} are heavier and more {{colorful}} than <b>the</b> <b>females.</b> <b>The</b> males also are larger with longer fins, while <b>the</b> <b>females</b> become plumper when ripe with eggs.|$|R
50|$|The head is small, {{with large}} and globose lateral eyes. Legs {{are long and}} slender. The males have a long slender abdomen with a curved upward end, while in <b>the</b> <b>females</b> <b>the</b> abdomen is stouter and not curved. <b>The</b> <b>females</b> are also smaller and with more angular wings. In <b>the</b> <b>females</b> <b>the</b> abdomen has three {{longitudinal}} black lines.|$|R
5|$|Females in estrus are {{followed}} by males, with copulation initiated by <b>the</b> <b>female.</b> <b>The</b> <b>female</b> will hang from a branch and may vocalise. The male will hold <b>the</b> <b>female</b> and the branch and copulate with her. Urine-marking and vocalising are also used by <b>the</b> <b>female</b> to solicit mating. The male may create a mating plug following copulation.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{the male}} mounts and copulates with <b>the</b> <b>female.</b> Afterward, the male {{generally}} dismounts {{and the two}} pair usually run away from each other. However, the male sometimes chases <b>the</b> <b>female</b> and tries to copulate again.|$|E
5|$|On {{emergence}} {{from the}} nest, <b>the</b> <b>female</b> is sexually receptive {{but does not}} choose her mate, but instead copulates with the first male of her species that finds her. Once <b>the</b> <b>female</b> has mated, she rebuffs all advances by other wasps.|$|E
50|$|In relation, {{males of}} the Photinus species are <b>the</b> prey for <b>females</b> of a {{different}} genus, Photuris. Photuris <b>females</b> actually mimic <b>the</b> effects of the Photinus males light-signaling patterns, and by doing this <b>the</b> <b>females</b> lure in <b>the</b> Photinus males. The males naturally produce the steroid lucibufagin, {{and the reason that}} <b>the</b> <b>females</b> prey on these males is to obtain this steroid. Once <b>the</b> <b>females</b> prey on <b>the</b> Photinus males, <b>the</b> <b>females</b> gain <b>the</b> steroid lucibufagin to use to their defense against jumping spiders. A study was performed where <b>the</b> Photuris <b>females</b> were collected from nature and forced to reflex bleed which contains the steroid lucibufagin. It was found that when <b>the</b> <b>females</b> were forced to reflex bleed, the samples taken from each female had different amounts of the steroid in each sample. So after experiments were brought out to see which <b>females</b> <b>the</b> jumping spiders would eat it was decided that the jumping spiders were more likely to eat <b>the</b> <b>females</b> with less lucibufagin inside their bodies and <b>the</b> <b>females</b> with more were constantly rejected by the spiders therefore protecting themselves from predation.|$|R
50|$|The males emerge first, 3-8 {{days before}} <b>the</b> <b>females</b> and gather around the nests, often {{entering}} them and sometimes assisting <b>the</b> <b>females</b> to hatch before mating with the docile, newly emerged females. After around two days <b>the</b> <b>females</b> commence hunting and may re-use old nests but construct new cells.|$|R
50|$|Males have a {{white or}} yellow face, while <b>the</b> <b>females</b> {{do not have}} these characteristics. Moreover, males often have much larger eyes than <b>the</b> <b>females.</b> Males do not contain a stinger, while <b>the</b> <b>females</b> are capable of using their stingers, but rarely do unless {{directly}} provoked or in immediate danger.|$|R
5|$|Several {{species of}} duck have brown-plumaged females {{that can be}} {{confused}} with <b>the</b> <b>female</b> mallard. <b>The</b> <b>female</b> gadwall (A.strepera) has an orange-lined bill, white belly, black and white speculum that {{is seen as a}} white square on the wings in flight, and is a smaller bird. More similar to <b>the</b> <b>female</b> mallard in North America are the American black duck (A.rubripes), which is notably darker-hued in both sexes than the mallard, and the mottled duck (A.fulvigula), which is somewhat darker than <b>the</b> <b>female</b> mallard, and with slightly different bare-part colouration and no white edge on the speculum.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>female</b> fisher {{begins to}} breed at about {{one year of}} age and her {{reproductive}} cycle is an almost year-long event. Mating takes place in late March to early April. Blastocyst implantation is then delayed for 10 months until mid-February of the following year when active pregnancy begins. After gestating for about 50 days, <b>the</b> <b>female</b> gives birth to one to four kits. <b>The</b> <b>female</b> then enters estrus 7–10 days later and the breeding cycle begins again.|$|E
5|$|The male then leads <b>the</b> <b>female</b> to {{potential}} nest sites, and <b>the</b> <b>female</b> will choose one. <b>The</b> <b>female</b> dove builds the nest. The male will fly about, gather material, {{and bring it}} to her. The male will stand on the female's back and give the material to <b>the</b> <b>female,</b> who then builds it into the nest. The nest is constructed of twigs, conifer needles, or grass blades, and is of flimsy construction. Mourning doves will sometimes requisition the unused nests of other mourning doves, other birds, or arboreal mammals such as squirrels.|$|E
50|$|The {{males of}} this species are larger than <b>the</b> <b>females.</b> <b>The</b> <b>females</b> can also be {{distinguished}} from males as their bills are disproportionally smaller.|$|R
50|$|While <b>the</b> <b>females</b> spawn, {{adult males}} set up small territories that they defend from other males in ritualized combats {{through which they}} court <b>the</b> <b>females.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In <b>the</b> <b>females</b> <b>the</b> tiny {{dark brown}} wings are {{partially}} {{hidden under the}} pronotum, while the males have very short tegmina. <b>The</b> <b>females</b> have a slightly curved ovipositor, which is somewhat shorter than the body.|$|R
5|$|The sexes are similar, {{although}} the male averages {{slightly larger than}} <b>the</b> <b>female</b> and has two prominent spurs on the legs, whereas <b>the</b> <b>female</b> is virtually unspurred. <b>The</b> <b>female</b> also has more rufous in its tail. The juvenile resembles the adults, but is duller, with buff barring, rather than streaking, on the underparts.|$|E
5|$|Tuatara {{reproduce}} very slowly, taking 10 to 20 {{years to}} reach sexual maturity. Mating occurs in midsummer; females mate and lay eggs once every four years. During courtship, a male makes his skin darker, raises his crests, and parades toward <b>the</b> <b>female.</b> He slowly walks in circles around <b>the</b> <b>female</b> with stiffened legs. <b>The</b> <b>female</b> will either submit, and allow the male to mount her, or retreat to her burrow. Males {{do not have a}} penis; they reproduce by the male lifting the tail of <b>the</b> <b>female</b> and placing his vent over hers. The sperm is then transferred into <b>the</b> <b>female,</b> much like the mating process in birds.|$|E
5|$|A clutch {{consists}} of 2 to 5 light green-grey eggs with darker spots. The mean clutch sizes of grey jays in Algonquin Provincial Park and La Verendrye Provincial Park were 3.03 and 3.18 eggs, respectively. Incubation is performed only by <b>the</b> <b>female</b> and lasts {{an average of}} 18.5 days. <b>The</b> <b>female</b> is fed on the nest by her partner, rarely moving from the nest during incubation and for several days after hatching.|$|E
5000|$|Adult wasps {{emerge from}} the ant nest in the morning; the males emerge before <b>the</b> <b>females.</b> In most cases, the males swarm one to two feet above the nest, {{and as soon as}} <b>the</b> <b>females</b> emerge, mating occurs. However, the males of certain species, such as Kapala terminalis, calmly wait on foliage {{surrounding}} the nest until <b>the</b> <b>females</b> emerge. Many times, the males will begin mating with <b>the</b> <b>females</b> before {{they have a chance to}} take flight, and in some instances, mating will occur while the wasps are still inside the ants' nest. [...] After mating, <b>the</b> <b>females</b> lay all their eggs in one day. The egg capacity of each female is 1000 to 10000.|$|R
50|$|When {{the bees}} emerge from their cocoons, the males exit first. The males {{typically}} remain near the nests waiting for <b>the</b> <b>females,</b> {{and some are}} known to actively extract females from their cocoons. When <b>the</b> <b>females</b> emerge, they mate with one or several males. The males soon die, {{and within a few}} days <b>the</b> <b>females</b> begin provisioning their nests.|$|R
5000|$|Dasypoda hirtipes is {{a mining}} bee. <b>The</b> <b>females</b> have unmistakable large orange brown {{hairbrushes}} at the hindlegs. With these brushes <b>the</b> <b>females</b> collect pollen from yellow Asteraceae. <b>The</b> <b>females</b> are nesting in, sometimes large, nest aggregations. Each female {{has her own}} burrow, and the sand from excavation is left as a wall around {{the entrance of the}} burrow.|$|R
5|$|A female P. labiata {{that sees}} a male may {{approach}} slowly or wait. The male then walks with erect and displaying by waving {{his legs and}} palps. If <b>the</b> <b>female</b> does not run away, she gives a propulsive display first. If the male stands his ground and she does not ran away or repeat the propulsive display, he approaches and, if she is mature, they copulate. If <b>the</b> <b>female</b> is sub-adult (one moult from maturity), a male may cohabit in the female's capture web. Portias usually mate on a web or on a dragline made by <b>the</b> <b>female.</b> P. labiata typically copulates for about 100seconds, while other genera can take several minutes or even several hours.|$|E
5|$|A {{member of}} the genus Latrodectus in the family Theridiidae, the redback belongs in a clade with the black widow spider, with the katipo as its closest relative. A 2004 {{molecular}} study supports the redback's status as a distinct species, as does the unique abdomen-presenting behaviour of the male during mating. The close {{relationship between the two}} species is shown when mating: the male redback is able to successfully mate with a female katipo producing hybrid offspring. However, the male katipo is too heavy to mate with <b>the</b> <b>female</b> redback, as it triggers a predatory response in <b>the</b> <b>female</b> when it approaches the web, causing <b>the</b> <b>female</b> to eat it. There is evidence of interbreeding between female katipo and male redbacks in the wild.|$|E
5|$|A noisy species, <b>the</b> <b>female</b> has {{the deep}} quack stereotypically {{associated}} with ducks. Male mallards {{make a sound}} phonetically {{similar to that of}} <b>the</b> <b>female,</b> a typical quack, but it is a deep and raspy and can also sound like breeeeze. When incubating a nest, or when offspring are present, females vocalise differently, making a call that sounds like a truncated version of the usual quack. They hiss if the nest or offspring are threatened or interfered with. When taking off, the wings of a mallard produce a characteristic faint whistling noise.|$|E
60|$|I have as {{yet only}} {{referred}} to the species in which the males are brighter coloured than <b>the</b> <b>females,</b> and I have attributed their beauty to <b>the</b> <b>females</b> for many generations having chosen and paired with the more attractive males. But converse cases occur, though rarely, in which <b>the</b> <b>females</b> are more brilliant than the males; and here, as I believe, the males have selected <b>the</b> more beautiful <b>females,</b> and have thus slowly added to their beauty. We {{do not know why}} in various classes of animals the males of some few species have selected <b>the</b> more beautiful <b>females</b> instead of having gladly accepted any female, as seems to be the general rule in the animal kingdom: but if, contrary to what generally occurs with <b>the</b> Lepidoptera, <b>the</b> <b>females</b> were much more numerous than the males, the latter would be likely to pick out <b>the</b> more beautiful <b>females.</b> Mr. Butler shewed me several species of Callidryas in the British Museum, in some of which <b>the</b> <b>females</b> equalled, and in others greatly surpassed the males in beauty; for <b>the</b> <b>females</b> alone have <b>the</b> borders of their wings suffused with crimson and orange, and spotted with black. The plainer males of these species closely resemble each other, shewing that here <b>the</b> <b>females</b> have been modified; whereas in those cases, where the males are the more ornate, it is these which have been modified, <b>the</b> <b>females</b> remaining closely alike.|$|R
50|$|Adult E. solidaginis {{emerge from}} their galls in the spring, with the males {{emerging}} prior to <b>the</b> <b>females.</b> <b>The</b> flies proceed to mate on goldenrod plants, and <b>the</b> <b>females</b> use their ovipositors to insert fertilized eggs into the buds of the goldenrod.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{many other}} bombyliids, {{the eggs are}} flicked by <b>the</b> adult <b>females</b> toward dark holes. <b>The</b> <b>females</b> may be found {{hovering}} near a dark hole in the sand shooting eggs. An animation, 6 times retarded, is given here. Every now and then <b>the</b> <b>females</b> are rubbing <b>the</b> abdomen in the sand in a small circular movement. Sand is necessary to make the eggs less tacky. To this end <b>the</b> <b>females</b> do have a sand chamber. An animation is given here.|$|R
5|$|About forty {{days after}} mating, <b>the</b> <b>female</b> giant Pacific octopus {{attaches}} strings of small fertilised eggs (10,000 to 70,000 in total) to rocks in a crevice or under an overhang. Here she guards and cares for them {{for about five}} months (160 days) until they hatch. In colder waters, such as those off of Alaska, it may take as much as 10 months for the eggs to completely develop. <b>The</b> <b>female</b> aerates the eggs and keeps them clean; if left untended, many eggs will not hatch. She does not feed during this time and dies soon afterwards. Males become senescent and die {{a few weeks after}} mating.|$|E
5|$|Adults {{aggregate}} {{in large}} numbers (>20 individuals) under rocks and logs along the immediate edge of the breeding sites and breed explosively over a few days. Suitable breeding sites include small fish-free ponds, marshes, shallow lakes and other still-water wetlands. Like other ambystomatid salamanders, they have evolved a characteristic courtship dance where they rub bodies and release pheromones from their chin gland prior to assuming a copulatory mating position. Once in position, the male deposits a spermatophore, which is a gooey stalk tipped with a packet of sperm, and walks <b>the</b> <b>female</b> forward to be inseminated. Males may mate more than once and may deposit as many as 15 spermatophores {{over the course of}} a five-hour period. The courtship dance for the long-toed salamander is similar to other species of Ambystoma and very similar to A.jeffersonianum. In the long-toed salamander, there is no rubbing or head-butting; the males directly approach females and grab on, while the females try to rapidly swim away. The males clasp <b>the</b> <b>female</b> from behind the forelimbs and shake, a behavior called amplexus. Males sometimes clasp other amphibian species during breeding and shake them as well. The male only grabs with the front limbs and never uses his hind limbs during the courtship dance as he rubs his chin side to side pressing down on the female's head. <b>The</b> <b>female</b> struggles but later becomes subdued. Males increase the tempo and motions, rubbing over the female's nostrils, sides, and sometimes the vent. When <b>the</b> <b>female</b> becomes quite docile the male moves forward with his tail positioned over her head, raised, and waving at the tip. If <b>the</b> <b>female</b> accepts the males courtship, the male directs her snout toward his vent region while both move forward stiffly with pelvic undulations. As <b>the</b> <b>female</b> follows, the male stops and deposits a spermatophore, and <b>the</b> <b>female</b> will move forward with the male to raise her tail and receive the sperm packet. The full courtship dance is rarely accomplished in the first attempt. Females deposit their eggs a few days after mating.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{courtship}} displays involve {{single and}} mutual high circling flight, {{and the male}} may fly around slowly with stiff exaggerated flaps, commonly known as butterfly-flight. Courting males dive at <b>the</b> <b>female,</b> feeding her in mid-flight. <b>The</b> <b>female</b> grabs food from the male's talons with hers while flipping upside-down. They may lock talons and tumble downwards in a ritualised version of grappling, but release just before landing. All courtship displays are accompanied by constant calling.|$|E
50|$|While he was 12 {{years of}} age, {{he was a}} “pretty boy,” and refused all of <b>the</b> <b>females</b> who loved him, and all of <b>the</b> <b>females</b> who {{approached}} him died from being so love-stricken. When he burned the love letters he received from all <b>the</b> <b>females,</b> due to one of <b>the</b> <b>females</b> who {{was not able to}} acquire her love, when the love letters burned, the smoke that came out enveloped him, turning him into an oni. Because of this, it was said that he, who became an oni, after moving from mountain to mountain centered on Honshu, eventually settled on Mt. Ooe.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>females</b> lay {{clutches}} of 50-60 eggs in soil or rotten wood. They stand guard over the eggs until the offspring is born. <b>The</b> <b>females</b> sometimes lick <b>the</b> eggs {{to protect them}} from fungi.|$|R
50|$|Araneus mitificus {{are small}} spiders and exhibit sexual dimorphism. <b>The</b> <b>females</b> {{grow up to}} 6 to 9 mm. Males are smaller, {{reaching}} only 3 to 5 mm, and are generally less colorful than <b>the</b> <b>females.</b>|$|R
