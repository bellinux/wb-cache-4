40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanism}} by which the Mn-containing oxygen evolving complex (OEC) produces oxygen from water has been of great interest for over 40 years. This review focuses on how X-ray spectroscopy has provided important information about the structure of this Mn complex and its intermediates, or S-states, in the water oxidation cycle. X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy and high-resolution Mn Kβ X-ray emission spectroscopy experiments have identified the oxidation states of the Mn in <b>the</b> <b>OEC</b> {{in each of the}} intermediate S-states, while extended X-ray absorption fine structure experiments have shown that 2. 7 Å Mn–Mn di-μ-oxo and 3. 3 Å Mn–Mn mono-μ-oxo motifs are present in <b>the</b> <b>OEC.</b> X-ray spectroscopy has also been used to probe the two essential cofactors in <b>the</b> <b>OEC,</b> Ca 2 + and Cl−, and has shown that Ca 2 + is an integral component of <b>the</b> <b>OEC</b> and is proximal to Mn. In addition, dichroism studies on oriented PS II membranes have provided angular information about the Mn–Mn and Mn–Ca vectors. Based on these X-ray spectroscopy data, refined models for the structure of <b>the</b> <b>OEC</b> and a mechanism for oxygen evolution by <b>the</b> <b>OEC</b> are presented...|$|R

40|$|Protein {{dynamics}} play a {{key role}} in enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Vibrational spectroscopy provides a method to follow these structural changes and thereby describe the reaction coordinate as a function of space and time. A vibrational spectroscopic technique, reaction-induced FTIR spectroscopy, has been applied to the study of <b>the</b> oxygen-evolving complex (<b>OEC)</b> of photosystem II (PSII). In plant photosynthesis, PSII evolves oxygen from the substrate, water, by the accumulation of photo-oxidizing equivalents at <b>the</b> <b>OEC.</b> Molecular oxygen and protons are the products of this reaction, which is responsible for the maintenance of an aerobic atmosphere on earth. <b>The</b> <b>OEC</b> is a Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster with nearby bound chloride ions. Sequentially oxidized states of <b>the</b> <b>OEC</b> are termed <b>the</b> S states. The dark-stable state is S 1, and oxygen is released on the transition from S 3 to S 0. Using short laser flashes, individual S states are generated, allowing vibrational spectroscopy to be used to study these different oxidation states of <b>the</b> <b>OEC.</b> In current X-ray crystal structures, hydrogen bonds to water molecules are predicted to form an extensive network around the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster. In <b>the</b> <b>OEC,</b> four peptide carbonyl groups are linked to the water network, which extends to two Mn-bound and two Ca-bound water molecules. This dissertation discusses a vibrational spectroscopic method that uses these peptide carbonyl frequencies as reporters of solvatochromic changes in <b>the</b> <b>OEC.</b> This technique provides a new, high-resolution method with which to study water and protein dynamics in PSII and other enzymes.

5|$|Japan {{is one of}} the top-performing OECD {{countries}} in reading literacy, maths and sciences with the average student scoring 540 and has one of the worlds highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries. The Japanese populace is well educated and its society highly values education as a platform for social mobility and for gaining employment in the country's competitive high-tech economy. The country's large pool of highly educated and skilled individuals is largely responsible for ushering Japan's post-war economic growth. Tertiary-educated adults in Japan, particularly graduates in sciences and engineering benefit economically and socially from their education and skills in the country's high tech economy. Spending on education as a proportion of GDP is below <b>the</b> <b>OECD</b> average. Although expenditure per student is comparatively high in Japan, total expenditure relative to GDP remains small. In 2015, Japan's public spending on education amounted to just 3.5 percent of its GDP, below <b>the</b> <b>OECD</b> average of 4.7%. In 2014, the country ranked fourth for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 48 percent. In addition, bachelor's degrees are held by 59 percent of Japanese aged 25–34, the second most in <b>the</b> <b>OECD</b> after South Korea. As the Japanese economy is largely scientific and technological based, the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher education, particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain a competitive edge when searching for employment opportunities.

40|$|Higher {{plants and}} algae use oxygenic {{photosynthesis}} to convert solar energy to reducing equivalents and chemical energy. The ultimate electron donor to oxygenic photosynthesis is water. Oxidation {{of water to}} oxygen occurs in <b>the</b> oxygen-evolving complex (<b>OEC)</b> in Photosystem II (PSII). <b>The</b> <b>OEC</b> is composed of four Mn atoms, Ca 2 + and Cl-. <b>The</b> <b>OEC</b> cycles through five states (S 0 - S 4) during oxidation of water to oxygen. <b>The</b> <b>OEC</b> can be studied with Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The shape of the EPR signals depends on the internal magnetic couplings between the Mn atoms and their ligand environment. To detect the EPR signal from the S 0 state {{it is necessary to}} add a few percent of methanol. The saturation of the S 0 multiline signal amplitude with increasing methanol concentration was compared to the saturation of the S 2 multiline signal amplitude. The S 0 and S 2 multiline signals show the same saturation behaviour. It was concluded that methanol affects the S 0 and S 2 states in a similar way. The effect of methanol has given new spectroscopic probes of the Mn cluster of <b>the</b> <b>OEC.</b> These can be used to further understand how <b>the</b> <b>OEC</b> functions. <b>The</b> second modification of <b>the</b> <b>OEC</b> was a change of the ambient pH. The pH is important for efficient electron transfer through PSII and optimal oxygen evolution. Acidic and alkaline pH-values were shown to decrease the amplitudes of the S 0 and S 2 multiline signals. The decrease of the amplitudes is reversible. The alkaline pH-treatment also induced a signal from <b>the</b> <b>OEC</b> in <b>the</b> formal S 3 state. The signal arises from the magnetic interaction between the Mn cluster in the S 2 state and the YZ-radical. It was concluded that at acidic pH the Mn cluster or a ligand to the Mn cluster becomes protonated and this changes the magnetic couplings of the Mn cluster. In the S 0 and S 2 states, either the Mn cluster or YZ lowers the redox potential by the alkaline pH-treatment. In the S 3 state, it is only YZ that lowers the redox potential. It is proposed that the difference between the S-states is due to the accessibility of protons. This shows that YZ has a very central role in the oxidation of water. The investigations presented in this thesis also shows that both the Mn cluster and YZ are solvent accessible...|$|R

The source of electrons is H 2 O, which is split to oxygen by <b>the</b> <b>OEC.</b> <b>The</b> water-splitting process involves cycling of the Mn-cluster through four semi-stable oxidation states, termed the S 0, S 1, S 2, and S 3 states. <b>The</b> <b>OEC</b> can be trapped in the different S-states, and studied by EPR techniques. The S 2 state is often obtained by exposing a dark-adapted (S 1 state) sample to continuous illumination at low temperature, or to a single flash of light at room temperature followed by freezing. Both procedures capture the S 2 state, as reached by a single oxidation of <b>the</b> <b>OEC</b> following a period of dark-adaptation. With a laser flash procedure, the S 2 state can be obtained a second time after 5 flashes, when the S-cycle has been completed once.

These data indicate a change within the Mn cluster that builds up during the first turnovers after dark-adaptation.
