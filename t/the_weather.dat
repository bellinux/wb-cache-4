M (2013). <b>The</b> <b>weathered</b> Carboniferous Limestone at Bullslaughter Bay, South Wales: {{the first}} example of ghost rock {{recorded}} in the British Isles. Geologica Belgica, 17, 33 - 42. The Carboniferous Limestone at Bullslaughter Bay hosts {{some of the most}} notable examples of deep <b>weathering</b> in <b>the</b> British Isles as well as two members of an enigmatic suite of breccias known as the Gash Breccias. <b>The</b> <b>weathered</b> limestone has been investigated thoroughly in order to identify the process responsible for <b>the</b> <b>weathering.</b> In this paper it is demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> is isovolumetric but <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> profile is not characterised by a vertical gradient and its depth suggests that meteoric waters did not contribute significantly to <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> process. <b>The</b> <b>weathered</b> limestone has lost significant amounts of calcium and parts are virtually decalcified. It is seen that the dominant primary minerals of illite and quartz have been preserved while secondary clay minerals are generally absent. <b>The</b> <b>weathered</b> limestone cannot be a saprolite sensu stricto as it has been subjected to only restricted chemical processes. It is, therefore, interpreted as a ?ghost-rock?. This type of weathering results from chemical dissolution by slow moving waters in the saturated zone. It is suggested that <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> may have taken place during periods of emergence in the Carboniferous, {{at the same time as}} the cyclothem tops were exposed to subaerial modification, as evidenced by omission surfaces and palaeokarstic solution features.

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>weathered</b> {{rocks on}} <b>the</b> {{external}} {{walls of the}} Yungang Grottoes, which are typically exposed stone relics, were evaluated in this study. First, <b>the</b> <b>weathered</b> zones on <b>the</b> external walls of the grottoes (Fig.  1 c) were tested using a nondestructive ultrasonic machine, and the corresponding ultrasonic velocities were calculated. It has been referenced from the Engineering Geologic Mapping Committee of the International Engineering Geology Association and the Laboratory and Site Standard Committee of the International Rock Mechanics Association [13], the longitudinal ultrasonic velocity ratios of <b>the</b> <b>weathered</b> and fresh rocks represent <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> levels of rocks in the Yungang Grottoes, {{as well as the}} classification of <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> degrees for materials such as marble and granite [14 – 16]. Next, the terahertz (THz) spectra of <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> samples in <b>the</b> study area were measured using a terahertz time-domain spectrum system (THz-TDS). This is a non-destructive, non-ionizing, high-sensitivity spectral system for synchronous coherent detection using samples weighing only approximately 0.2  g [17 – 20]. The THz spectral data and <b>the</b> corresponding <b>weathering</b> levels determined by means of the ultrasonic tests were combined as training and test samples. Last, a regression model for prediction of <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> levels of <b>the</b> grotto walls was established based on these samples using a least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM). The LS-SVM employs a machine learning software package known for its quick operation, strong generalization, and ability to solve various practical problems, such as those involving small sample sizes, over-fitting, and high dimensions [21 – 23]. The LS-SVM regression model obtained as described above is a new, highly accurate, and economical method for predicting <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> levels of stone relics based on experimental spectral data from weathered materials.|$|R

Loaded with double shot, the opening American salvo struck the French frigate's quarterdeck. Barreaut's vessel replied with her own broadside that damaged Constellation's fore topmast. Midshipman David Porter, stationed in the rigging of Constellations damaged mast, managed to relieve pressure from it and prevented its collapse. L'Insurgente attempted to close on the American frigate to board her, but Constellation held <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> gage and had less damage to her rigging, enabling her to avoid Barreaut's attempt to draw alongside.|$|E
