5000|$|A modern {{development}} of the straight-two engine, pioneered by the Yamaha TRX850, is the 270° crank, which imitates the sound and feel of a 90° V-twin, but requires a balance shaft to reduce vibration. Effectively, the 270° crank is a compromise which allows a more regular firing pattern than a 180° crank and less vibration than a 360° crank. As with a 90° V-twin, the pistons in a 270° inline twin engine are never both stationary at the same time, thereby reducing the net momentum exchange between the crank and pistons during a full rotation. The oscillating momentum manifests itself as an oscillating crank rotation speed, which, when paired with a driven-wheel rotating at the more steady road speed, will introduce an oscillating torque in the drivetrain and at the <b>tyre</b> <b>contact</b> <b>patch.</b>|$|E

The conditions of the experiment are a dry and level road surface without steering inputs. To record scientific results, a brake robot system is used.

40|$|A new tyre-force {{model for}} {{simultaneous}} braking and cornering is presented, {{which is based}} on combining existing empirical models for pure braking and cornering with brush-model tyre mechanics. The aim is to offer an easy-to-use, accurate model for vehicle-handling simulations. On a working <b>tyre</b> the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> between the <b>tyre</b> and the road is, in general, divided into an adhesion region where the rubber is gripping the road and a sliding region where the rubber slides on the road surface. The total force generated by the tyre is then composed of components from these two regions. The brush model describes this in a mechanical framework. The proposed model is based on a new method to extract adhesion and sliding forces from empirical pure-slip tyre models. These forces are then scaled to account for the combined-slip condition. The combined-slip self-aligning torque is also described. A particular feature of the model is the inclusion of velocity dependence, even if this is not explicitly present in the empirical pure-slip model. The approach is quite different from most previous combined-slip models, in that it is based on a rather detailed mechanical model in combination with empirical pure-slip models. The model is computationally sound and efficient and does not rely on any additional parameters that depend on combined-slip data for calibration. It can be used in combination with virtually any empirical pure-slip model and in this work the Magic Formula is used in examples. Results show good correspondence with experimental data...|$|R
40|$|New system {{technologies}} are continuously improving {{the performance of}} vehicles with regard to safety, comfort, stability and the environment. The development of control systems based on anti-lock braking system, active steering control, adaptive cruise control, collision avoidance, electronic stability programme or roll-over prevention systems, facilitated these improvements. In order to maximise the benefits from such devices, information about the tyre/road friction parameter is required in real-time. As it is impractical to measure the tyre/road friction coefficient, estimation from other available parameters is essential. In this thesis, the main theoretical contribution {{is the development of}} sliding mode schemes for tyre/road friction estimation. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, a sliding mode based scheme is designed for a braking scenario. The scheme is designed to maintain the longitudinal slip value associated with the <b>tyre</b> road <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> at an optimum value utilising a sliding mode controller, subject to varying road conditions. The stability of the controller is proven using a Lyapunov function and Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) method. An analysis of the designed scheme in the presence of imperfect measurement of wheel angular velocity is also presented. The sliding mode scheme is also compared with an adaptive scheme from the literature. The comparison study shows that the sliding mode based scheme appears more robust than the adaptive scheme, and the simulation results are supported by the analysis. Another key contributions in this thesis is the development of a sliding mode based scheme which is independent of the underlying friction model. This distinguishes the work proposed in this thesis from the existing literature. Finally a comparative study is presented for the observers considered in this thesis using three different friction models. The results for different road conditions show that the sliding mode based schemes out-perform the adaptive scheme for the tests undertaken.

The image processing technique was used for determination of the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> length and <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> width.

The highest values of contact length and width and tire deflection occurred at the highest wheel load and lowest tire inflation pressure. <b>Contact</b> <b>patch</b> width is a polynomial (order 2) function of wheel load while there is a linear relationship between tire contact length and wheel load as well as between tire deflection and wheel load.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an initial Finite Element (FE) based modelling investigation aimed at supporting {{the development of}} 'smart' tyre or intelligent tyre technologies. Physical tests carried out with a stationary (non-rolling) and rolling experimental tyre are used to enhance understanding of tyre behaviour in the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> and validate the modelling methodology. Simulation results with the explicit FE package LS-DYNA are then used to characterise the internal stresses and strains at several positions in the tyre tread. Two separate FE models are developed to simulate the stationary and rolling tyre behaviour at the macroscopic level. The models differ only {{with respect to the}} mesh density in the circumferential direction, the mesh through the cross section is identical. The complex tyre structure is represented as a rubber and reinforced rubber composite, and the mesh specification and the material descriptions used in the models are discussed. The structural behaviour of the stationary experimental tyre under normal load is simulated. The inflation of the tyre, the wheel fit and the normal loading against the horizontal surface are represented. Simulation results are also presented when a subsequent longitudinal or lateral load is applied to the stationary tyre. These analyses were conducted to determine the longitudinal and lateral tyre stifffiesses, respectively. The predicted normal load-deflection characteristics and <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> dimensions (length and width) are compared with a reasonable degree of success to those obtained in the full-scale physical tests. The longitudinal and lateral simulations also appear to give realistic <b>tyre</b> stiffnesses. The <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> dimensions give a good trend-wise agreement, but the length and width are greater than the experimental measurements. A parametric study is carried out and this disparity is related to a deficiency in the performance of the contact algorithms. It is concluded that it not straightforward to accurately predict <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> behaviour, and therefore the internal transient stresses and strains in a rolling tyre in absolute terms. However, the good trend-wise agreement suggests that the modelling methodology should be capable of predicting internal transient responses which are related to the 'actual' deformations in the contact region. To simulate the rolling tyre behaviour on flat bed and drum surfaces, consideration is given to the inflation of the tyre, the wheel fit, the normal loading and the rotation of the tyre. Numerical instabilities are found to occur and these are related to imperfections inherent in version 950 d of the code. This version was, at the time, the most up to date release. The current release is version 960 and it does not contain many of the imperfections in the earlier version. Thus, the flat bed simulation is repeated using the current version. The predicted <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> stresses are presented and a reasonable correlation is achieved with the experimental data. The internal stresses and strains are then characterised at a number of selected positions in the tread region. These stresses and strains are discussed in context with the development of smart tyre technologies and are useful as a guide to the most appropriate location for an in-tyre sensor (or sensors) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Linear graph theory, {{invented in}} 1736 by Leonhard Euler, has been {{combined}} with principles of physics to develop algorithms for formulating the dynamic equations for multi-body multi-domain systems. This graph-theoretic formulation allows electrical, mechanical, and hydraulic systems to be modelled within a common framework. The formulation has been imple-mented in a symbolic computer program, DynaFlexPro, that automatically generates compact and efficient sets of system equations {{that lead to}} reduced simulation times compared with most commercial multi-body dynamics software. In this article, models of pneumatic tyres are incorporated into the symbolic computer imple-mentation, {{which is used to}} create real-time simulations of vehicle dynamics. The tyre component forms a list of symbolic expressions for important tyre variables, such as inclination and slip angle, that are used to calculate tyre forces and moments during simulation. If the transient behaviour of the tyre is important, the user can request that additional relaxation length equations be included in the model. The tyre component allows the user to choose from several tyre model functions that describe the generation of forces and moments at the <b>tyre</b> <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> and can also accommodate user-developed tyre model functions. A brief introduction to the linear graph formulation procedure used by DynaFlexPro is given, as well as an explanation of how the tyre component works within the linear graph framework. As an example, optimized simulation code is generated for a three-dimensional vehicle model, and results are validated using an equivalent model in the MSC. ADAMS ® commercial software package...|$|E
40|$|Growing traffic volumes, {{increasing}} {{construction and}} maintenance costs continually drive for more innovative approaches and methodologies towards sustainable road infrastructure. At the current price levels of around R 6000 per metric tonne, bitumen, as a “raw ” product, {{is by far}} the most costly element in flexible pavements, for example compared to Crushed stone, which is at approximately R 170 per metric tonne. Since the asphalt layer or relatively thin bituminous seal acts as the stress barrier between rolling tyres and the road structure it needs to be durable so as to withstand current traffic loading and hence contact stresses, given the environmental forces also acting on it. For road infrastructure to perform as expected, it is important to optimize road pavement design, especially close to the surface of the pavement requiring accurate modelling of tyre-road contact stresses. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate modern ways to idealise tyre-road interaction based on Stress-In-Motion (SIM) results, in particular the way in which numerical analyses are used (and developed) to address non-uniformly distributed tyre contact stresses on the surface of the pavements. A tyre model is demonstrated whereby the SIM measured contact stress distribution is idealised with a multitude of circular and rectangular shapes, mimicking the non-uniform characteristics of the contact stresses inside the <b>tyre</b> <b>contact</b> <b>patch.</b> An example, in terms of pavement layer life and strain energy of distortion, is given highlighting the effects of different tyre-road models on a typical flexible road structure, compared to the traditional circular shape model of a single uniformly distributed contact stress (1 D) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} the first ever racing vehicle yaw control system that utilises active dampers to provide a corrective yaw moment through the manipulation of <b>tyre</b> <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> loads during transient vehicle handling manoeuvres. The study has focused on the following three key areas, 1) The design of a magneto-rheological (MR) damper The damping requirements of a racing vehicle are investigated. A prototype magneto- rheological damper is proposed and evaluated using magnetic finite element techniques. The manufactured prototype is subsequently tested and benchmarked against a passive racing damper and a commercially available MR damper. Consideration is given to the current driver circuit required, the damper response time to increasing and decreasing demand signals and sealing and bearing requirements. 2) A novel yaw damping strategy utilising active MR dampers This work proposes a novel active damping strategy for vehicle yaw control. The dampers are used to control both the pitch and roll damping distribution during transient vehicle handling manoeuvres. It is shown that this approach improves the functionality of previous damper based yaw control that only considered roll damping distribution. 3) In-Vehicle implementation and track testing An in-vehicle damper control system is developed using hardware that has not previously been employed in this application. This study is the first to apply a damper based yaw control system to a racing vehicle. Track testing of the racing vehicle fitted with the damper control system is used to demonstrate the potential improvements achievable in the context of lap time, subjective driver feel and measured yaw error.

5|$|Another torque is {{produced}} by the finite width of the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> and the lean of the tire in a turn. The portion of the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> towards {{the outside of the}} turn is actually moving rearward, with respect to the wheel's hub, faster {{than the rest of the}} <b>contact</b> <b>patch,</b> because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion is moving rearward more slowly.

50|$|The tire <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> {{is readily}} changed by both over- and underinflation. Overinflation may {{increase}} the wear on the center <b>contact</b> <b>patch,</b> and underinflation will cause a concave tread, resulting in less center contact, though the overall <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> will still be larger. Most modern tires will wear evenly at high tire pressures, but will degrade prematurely if underinflated. An increased tire pressure may decrease rolling resistance, and may also result in shorter stopping distances If tire pressure is too low, the tire <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> is greatly increased. This increases rolling resistance, tire flexing, and friction between the road and tire. Under-inflation can lead to tire overheating, premature tread wear, and tread separation in severe cases.|$|R

40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} tyre tread pattern design for optimum wet grip performance. A mathematical model of tyre behaviour on wet roads has been developed. This utilizes the finite element method in the representation of tread pattern geometry. The performance of a particular tread pattern is found {{in terms of the}} fluid pressures and film thicknesses existing within the contact patch, under wet conditions. Many modern tread patterns are based on 'blocks', and a computer model has been developed specifically to assist the tyre designer in the design of these blocks for improved wet grip. Numerical results are presented both for complete contact patches and for individual tread blocks. To allow the use of the computer models by the tyre designer, with no specialist knowledge of the finite element method, special purpose mesh generation and plotting programs have been developed. Experiments have been undertaken whereby the fluid pressures and film thicknesses existing in the <b>tyre</b> <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> have been measured under high speed conditions in the wet. These measure- ments were made on an indoor testing machine, and the techniques developed can be used in the routine evaluation of tyre wet grip performance. Some results of experiments performed on plain and simple patterned tyres are presented. The main purpose of this work was the development of the mathematical models which can be used for future research into, and design of, tyres for improved wet grip.

As such the problems addressed fall in the area of ground vehicle dynamics and the modelling of the tyre presents similar challenges to those involved in modelling automotive tyres, albeit on a much larger scale in terms of the size and the loads on the tyre. The model has been implemented in the Matlab/Simulink environment and designed to run initially with aircraftmodels defined by the industry standard multi-body systems program MSC. ADAMS (TM). An overview is provided of current automotive and aircraft tyre models along with a critique of the application and capabilities of these existing models for aircraftsimulation. The need for a model which can be used to fit the limited range of data available for aircraft tyres, compared with automotive tyres, is also discussed. The proposed low parameter tyre model (LPTM) uses a small set of model parameters that can be obtained without recourse to special software and can be easily manipulated to fit the model to available tyre test data. The model has been exercised and compared with two existing tyre models, using a multi-body computer model of a tyre test machine and has been shown to produce improved predictions of the important forces and moments generated in a <b>tyre</b> <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> when validated against test data.

Earlier studies of vertical contact stresses of the test tyres of the MMLS 3 by Sime M & Ashmore SC, (1999), Epps Martin et al (2000) and Doupal et al (2002) that were conducted with different stress measuring devices reported higher vertical contact stresses at the upper level of tyre inflation pressures. It is therefore recommended that the influence of test surface characteristics and the impact on SIM measurements of HVS and MMLS 3 tyres be investigated in greater detail in future similar studies. It is nevertheless strongly recommended that the foregoing be incorporated into MMLS 3 and HVS comparative and/or individual testing programs (and protocols) to permit a more rational interpretation of test data from both these devices relative to structural road pavement performance issues, especially on the surface of flexible road pavements.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis {{is devoted to the}} study of mechanism of tyre force generation and its influence on handling dynamics of ground vehicles. The main part of the work involves the development of tyre models for use under steady-state and transient operating conditions. The general capability of these models is assessedin a full vehicle simulation environment. The interaction between tyre and vehicle dynamics is critically evaluated and the observed vehicle behaviour is related to the inherent characteristics of different tyre models. In the field of steady-state tyre modelling, two versions of a numerical tyre model are developed. The modelling procedure is carried out in accordance with the viscoelastic properties of rubber, which influence the mechanical properties of the tyre structure and {{play a significant role in}} the determination of friction in the <b>tyre</b> <b>contact</b> <b>patch.</b> Whilst the initial simple version of the tyre model assumes a parabolic pressure distribution along the contact, a later more elaborate model employs a numerical method for the calculation of the actual normal pressure distribution. The changes in the pressure distribution as a result of variations in the rolling velocity and normal load influence mainly the levels of self-aligning moment, whilst the force characteristics remain practically unaffected. The adoption of a velocity dependent friction law explains the force generating behaviour of tyres at high sliding velocities. The analysis is extended to the area of transient tyre behaviour with the development of a tyre model appropriate for the study of transient friction force generation within the contact patch. The model incorporates viscoelasticity and inertial contributions, and incorporates a numerical stick-slip law. These characteristics are combined together for the successful simulation of transient friction force generation. The methodologies developed for the modelling of transient friction and steady-state tyre force generation are combined and further extended in order to create a generic transient tyre model. This final model incorporates a discretised flexible viscoelastic belt with inertia and a separate fully-dynamic discretised tread, also with inertia and damping, for the simulation of actual prevailing conditions in the contact patch. The generic tyre model appears to be capable of performing under a variety of operating conditions, including periodic excitations and transient inputs which extend to the non-linear range of tyre behaviour. For the evaluation of the influence of the aforementioned tyre models on the handling responses of a vehicle, a comprehensive vehicle model is developed, appropriate for use in handling simulations. The two versions of the steady-state models and the generic transient model are interfaced with the vehicle model, and the response of the vehicle to a step-steer manoeuvre is compared with that obtained using the Magic Formula tyre model. The comparison between the responses is facilitated by the definition of a new measure, defined as the non-dimensional yaw impulse. It is found that the transience involved in tyre behaviour may largely affect the response of a vehicle to a prescribed input. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
5000|$|As with {{deformation}} of a spring, {{deformation of}} the tire <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> generates a reaction {{force in the}} tire; the cornering force. Integrating the force generated by every tread element along the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> length gives the total cornering force. Although the term, [...] "tread element" [...] is used, the compliance in the tire that leads to this effect is actually a combination of sidewall deflection and deflection of the rubber within the <b>contact</b> <b>patch.</b> The exact ratio of sidewall compliance to tread compliance {{is a factor in}} tire construction and inflation pressure.|$|R

The work is an attempt to develope a numerical scheme that is universally applicable to all possible running conditions. The tire-road <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> is approximated as a two-dimensional array of nodal points. Properties such as distribution of normal pressure, deflection and stresses over the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> are expressed as sets of the respective nodal values rather than analytical functions. Such a representation enables the treatment of any arbitrary, two-dimensional variation of <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> properties. The representation of non-rectangular <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> shapes and trapezoidal pressure distributions is also discussed. For steady state running conditions the performance of the scheme is compared with that of an existing analytical model. The applicability of the scheme to transient running conditions is also shown...|$|R
