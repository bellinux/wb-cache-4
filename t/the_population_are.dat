5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication {{is used by}} individuals to compensate for severe speech-language impairments in the expression or comprehension of spoken or written language.

Prevalence data vary depending on the country and age/disabilities surveyed, but typically between 0.1 and 1.5% of <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>are</b> considered to have such severe speech-language impairments that they have difficulty making themselves understood, and thus could benefit from AAC.

The streets of London erupt into violence as those affected go on a rampage. Breen becomes drawn towards the craft and is killed. Quatermass falls under the alien control as well, but is snapped out of it by Roney, who is unaffected. The two men realise that {{a small portion of}} <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>are</b> immune. The psychic energy becomes stronger, ripping up streets and buildings, and the spectral image of a Martian towers above the city, centred on Hobbs End. Recalling stories about how the Devil could be defeated with iron and water, Roney theorises the Martian energy could be discharged into the earth. Roney climbs {{to the top of a}} building crane and swings it into the spectre. The crane bursts into flames as it discharges the energy, killing Roney, but the image disappears.|$|E
