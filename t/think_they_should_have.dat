In answer to a question about whether or not women [...] "will ever equal or surpass men in climbing", Hill gave a detailed response, focused on body composition, size, and psychology, explaining that climbing [...] "favors people with high strength-to-weight ratios", less body fat, and greater height, articulating that such characteristics often favor men but that women [...] "have the advantage of being relatively light, with the capacity for tremendous endurance". She explained that [...] "theoretically somebody as short as me could be {{the best in the world}} because it doesn't depend so much on height now...

Towards the eighties, Poland's Solidarity union became very popular and he tried to initiate something alike among workers in his own union. But due to bureaucracy and complaints about him being too loud, he got into trouble and was interrogated by the police. He felt that the atmosphere in his country was changing, people and groups were set against each other, nationalism was growing rapidly. When Milošević and Tuđman appeared, things got very tense already. Near Benkovac he found out that the Serbs were armed and formed so called defence units. His wife got very nervous under the tension. But the couple did not leave with their children when the war started. With the wisdom of hindsight, he <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> left for their children. They have seen such atrocities and still suffer from this experience. He gives some examples of the considerable tension in daily situations during the war, he reports on the time he was captured by Arkan's men and he reflects on the black and white thinking about the situation by people who have not been there at the time...|$|R

50|$|Deprivation Theory {{means that}} people who are {{deprived}} of things deemed valuable in society—whether money, justice, status or privilege—join social movements with the hope of redressing their grievances. This is a beginning point for looking at why people join social movements; however, it is even more important to look at relative deprivation theory, a belief that people join social movement based on their evaluations of what they <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> compared with what others have. On the contrary, absolute deprivation is people's actual negative condition; relative deprivation is what people <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> relative to what others have, or even compared with their own past or perceived future. Improved conditions fuel human desires for even better conditions, and thus can spark revolutions.|$|E

40|$|Ekino et al. [1] {{reported}} the cloning and characterization {{of a novel}} cytotoxic protein (Parasporin- 5) produced by Bacillus thuringiensis strain A 1100. The 33. 8 -kDa inactive precursor protein exhibited strong cytocidal activity upon proteinase K activation against several mammalian (cancer) cell lines, and showed slight homology with Cry and aerolysin-type β-pore-forming toxins. Most research concerning parasporins has mainly been performed in order to demonstrate their use as potential therapeutic agents against cancer, but they are lacking additional research supporting the absence of activity against invertebrates; especially, {{taking into account that}} these toxins are not expected to evolve to kill cancer cells. Therefore, it is reasonable to <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> another (unknown) target in nature. Despite the fact that in this work, the authors demonstrated the toxic activity of this protein against several types of cancer cells, further complementary studies against a minimum number of insects would be of great interest {{in order to determine the}} potential insecticidal activity of this protein and understand its natural role.

40|$|The Native {{peoples of}} North America still confront the {{challenges}} of lingering colonial cultural imperialism. One such challenge is that of Native education, and its unfortunate management by the European-descended political powers. Using tactics such as assimilation, segregation and integration, the establishment used schooling as a blunt tool to solve the so-called "Indian problem" [...] -that is, the assimilation of the Native population into the European way of life. The results were predictably tragic; the current education system is still perceived {{as a tool of}} colonization by many Natives. After so many failed attempts, policy-makers are finally looking to return to the First Nations the education they need, not what North America <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>have.</b> One example of this is the proposal to create an institution of higher learning within the Cree communities of Northern Quebec. This dissertation examines the possible challenges and benefits of such a project. It explores the relationship between Cree students and the current "mainstream" education system by way of research, participant-observation narrative and the voice of the Cree themselves while interviewed. Since they must travel to non-Native communities to pursue higher education, Cree students typically deal with culture shock, alienation and no small degree of racism while studying. In addition a commonality of experience between the Cree and students of other Native communities while attending a "white" school precipitates a pan-Indian/super-tribal perspective, which becomes an important factor in their world view. Because this dissertation uses participant-observation and interview methodologies for research, and because the subjects of the observation and the interviews are Cree students, then it is necessary for this dissertation to first survey the topics of Pan-Indian Identity and Culture Shock and put them into context. In fact, {{a large part of the}} participant-observation narrative is that of the author integrating into a Cree community as an educator. This narrative essentially documents the author's own stages of culture shock, a mirror to that which the Native student faces "down south" at college. These are examples of the real anxieties and challenges faced when immersed in a new and different culture. The Native perspective is provided by the Cree students themselves in interviews that were fortunately rich in narrative recollection. In addition to answering the standard interview questions, the interviewees offered their own anecdotes, observations and insights into their experiences within the "mainstream" education system. The conclusions drawn in this body of research may go towards dealing with the legacy of Cree distrust towards an educational system possibly perceived as an imposition of a colonizing society, and to answering the real needs of Native students who are seeking to benefit from education, whatever its form...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} paper Edwards, Kirchin, and Huxtable {{have argued that}} {{research}} ethics committees (RECs) are often wrongfully paternalistic in their approach to medical research.

60|$|Like Chaucer, Spenser was a busy man of affairs, but in him {{the poet}} and the scholar always predominates. He writes as the idealist, {{describing}} men not {{as they are}} but as he <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> be; he <b>has</b> no humor, and his mission is not to amuse but to reform. Like Chaucer he studies the classics and contemporary French and Italian writers; but instead of adapting his material to present-day conditions, he makes poetry, as in his Eclogues for instance, more artificial even than his foreign models. Where Chaucer looks about him and describes life as he sees it, Spenser always looks backward for his inspiration; he lives dreamily in the past, in a realm of purely imaginary emotions and adventures. His first quality is imagination, not observation, {{and he is the}} first of our poets to create a world of dreams, fancies, and illusions. His second quality is a wonderful sensitiveness to beauty, which shows itself not only in his subject-matter but also in the manner of his poetry. Like Chaucer, he is an almost perfect workman; but in reading Chaucer we think chiefly of his natural characters or his ideas, while in reading Spenser we think of the beauty of expression. The exquisite Spenserian stanza and the rich melody of Spenser's verse have made him the model of all our modern poets.|$|R
40|$|Plants and {{environment}} play {{important roles in}} the Semelai’s living culture. This association and dependency upon plants and other natural resources, however, is deteriorating due to the depletion of these resources. Fieldwork was conducted in Tasek Bera, Pahang, Malaysia, {{with the objective of}} interrogating the ethnobotany of the Semelai, an Indigenous community locally known as Orang Asli Semelai who have lived within these wetlands territories for more than 600 years. The Tasek Bera is being one of RAMSAR's internationally protected and monitored habitats and contributes to the significance of this Indigenous community being studied. Participant observation, in order to have indepth understanding, was carried out where a selection of respondents was questioned about their knowledge and expertise. This ethnographic research was directed at investigating and evaluating Indigenous knowledge {{and environment}}al heritage which started within the ambit of ethnobotany. This thesis offers insights to the reader from a multi-disciplinary perspective that engages in a wide body of interdisciplinary works including sociology, landscape planning, architecture, anthropology, ethnobotany and ethnology. Taking ethnology to its most general definition, the sub-discipline refers to investigation of the socio-cultural distinctiveness of a community. This thesis investigates the associations and inter-relationships of this particular Indigenous society with their environment to determine their decision-making processes and rationale that characterises their culture. This thesis explores how Indigenous knowledge, perceptions, values and activities that are embedded in the ethnology of the Semelai can and should be incorporated into present Indigenous settlement design and planning in order to sustain this Indigenous group’s intrinsic values. Spatial mobility among the Semelai is of interest in ethnological study, as this process is related to transformations of the landscape and the environment. The novel approaches used in this study could be used in future landscape methodological studies and analysis about human culture. They however require an indepth understanding {{of the people who are}} using the space rather than what designers and planners <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>have.</b> It is therefore hoped that insights from this dissertation may inform agencies involved in the planning and development policies of Malaysia and may also to offer a valuable window into the world of the Semelai’s ethnology.

Included in the discussion is the approach and methodology of the historian, the materials available for use, and knowledge of the background of Canada, the British Empire and the war “for King and Country. ” It appeals for an understanding of war and of patriotism Canadian-style as of 1914 - 1918, as a war they fought and not the one we now <b>think</b> <b>they</b> fought or <b>should</b> <b>have</b> fought. It is an appeal for “sharp end” history. Attention is given to monuments of valour – rolls of honour, plaques, banners, stained glass, gravestones and markers, memorial trees and, above all, school records. The history should be a tribute to a youth now no longer with us. The history, when written, becomes its own memorial to their passing and sacrifice and may serve as an example for other such histories to be crafted. Lastly, it is a legacy to a grey generation of mothers, sisters and sweethearts who far from the searing battle line were also victims in this catastrophic eruption that forever changed Canada and, through what I call the Vimy Alchemy, made a nation in an age of dissolving empires. Above all, keep school records related to this war and to others. Years hence other historians will be grateful...|$|R

40|$|Digital {{technology}} {{is to be}} found in many places today, especially in school. The purpose of this study was to examine the use of digital tools in the teaching of mathematics by lower secondary teachers. The method of the study was a qualitative method in which eight teachers from tree different schools were interviewed. The material collected from the interviews was analyzed on the basis of a content analysis, where the results were divided into two main categories and then into subcategories. The two main categories that emerged were "Digital tools in teaching" and "Teachers´ perception of digital tools". The earlier research indicated that the teachers´skills had great influence in how they choose to use the digital tools. Research also showed that digital tools, if used for the right purpose, could affect student motivation and mathematical understanding in a positive way. The result of the study shows that all the teachers that participated see digital tools as something positive even though <b>they</b> themselves <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> had more digital skills. They however see a profit with digital tools and believe that students become more committed when they use them. <b>They</b> also <b>think</b> that digital tools are important in order to make a difference in their teaching. What emerges from the result is that digital tools in teaching have a good effect on students´ motivation but that teachers´ digital skills need to be improved. The government´s decision to clarify the curriculum in terms of digital competence also places higher demands on teachers.  Digital teknik finns i dagens läge på många ställen, inte minst i skolan. Syftet med den här studien var att undersöka lågstadielärares användning av digitala verktyg i matematikundervisningen. Studien genomfördes med en kvalitativ metod där åtta lärare i från tre olika skolor intervjuades. Det material som samlades in från intervjuerna analyserades utifrån en innehållsanalys där resultatet delades in i två olika huvudkategorier och sedan i underkategorier. De två huvudkategorierna som uppstod var "Digitala verktyg i undervisningen" och "Lärarnas uppfattning om digitala verktyg". Den tidigare forskning som togs fram antydde att lärarens kompetens påverkar mycket hur de väljer att använda de digitala verktygen. Forskningen visade också att digitala verktyg, om de används i rätt syfte, kan ge en positiv effekt på elevers studiemotivation och matematiska förståelse. I resultatet framkom att alla lärare ser digitala verktyg som något positivt trots att de själva anser att de borde fått mer kompetensutveckling i ämnet. De ser en vinst med digitala verktyg och anser att eleverna blir mer engagerade när de får använda dem. De menar också att digitala verktyg är viktiga för att få till en variation i sin undervisning. Det som framkommer utifrån resultatet är att digitala verktyg i undervisningen har en god effekt på elevers motivation men att lärarnas kompetens inom området måste förbättras.  Regeringens beslut om att förtydliga läroplanen vad gäller digital kompetens ställer också högre krav på lärare. ...|$|R
