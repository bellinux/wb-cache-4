5|$|In Russia, the Ministry of Atomic Energy (Minatom) is {{responsible}} for 31 nuclear reactors which generate about 16% of its electricity. Minatom is also responsible for reprocessing and radioactive waste disposal, including over 25,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel in <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{electric}} utilities have been transporting spent fuel to interim storage facilities at Gorleben, Lubmin and Ahaus until <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> facilities {{can be built}} near reactor sites. Previously, spent fuel was sent to France or the United Kingdom for reprocessing, but this practice was ended in July 2005.|$|E

5|$|In 1969 RAF Duxford, a Royal Air Force fighter {{airfield}} in Cambridgeshire {{was declared}} surplus to requirements by the Ministry of Defence. Needing further space, the museum duly requested {{permission to use}} part of the site as <b>temporary</b> <b>storage.</b> The entire site was later transferred to the museum in February 1976 and Duxford, now referred to as Imperial War Museum Duxford became the museum's first branch. Also during the 1970s the government {{raised the possibility of}} the museum taking over the historic Cabinet War Rooms in Whitehall. The museum was reluctant due to its new commitments related to Duxford and HMS Belfast, but agreed in 1982.|$|E
5|$|RAF Duxford, a Royal Air Force fighter station {{had been}} {{declared}} surplus to requirements by the Ministry of Defence in 1969, {{and the museum}} duly requested permission to use {{part of one of}} the airfield's hangars as <b>temporary</b> <b>storage.</b> Duxford featured three double bay hangars of First World War vintage, which together provided over 9000m2 of space. Within two years, ten of the museum's aircraft had been brought to Duxford, and were being restored by volunteers of the East Anglia Aviation Society. While the museum's own aircraft were not restored to flying condition, by cooperating with private groups the museum was able to mount its first airshow in 1973. Further air shows followed, with a display in June 1976 attracting an audience of 45,000 people. The runway was bought by Cambridgeshire County Council in 1977. The success of these shows provided a valuable source of revenue, and complemented the efforts of volunteers, so that the museum applied for the permanent transfer of the entire site to its use. Permission was received in February 1976 and Duxford became the first outstation of the Imperial War Museum. Initially open from March–October, Duxford received 167,000 visitors in the 1977 season, and 340,000 in 1978. Two million visitors had been received by 1982 and Duxford welcomed its ten millionth visitor in August 2005.|$|E

The use of virtual memory for <b>temporary</b> data <b>storage</b> has received criticism because of performance problems. However, modern virtual memory found in recent operating systems such as Cenju- 3 /DE give application writers control over virtual memory policies. We demonstrate that custom virtual memory policies can dramatically reduce virtual memory overhead and allow applications to run out-of-core efficiently. We also demonstrate that the main advantage of virtual memory, namely programming simplicity, is not lost.

40|$|Container {{classes in}} {{object-oriented}} languages often {{suffer from the}} problem of compiler-generated <b>temporaries.</b> <b>Storage</b> is allocated for each intermediate result in each expression, introducing huge penalties to performance. Loop fusion and array contraction, the most closely related compiler optimizations to this problem, are not powerful enough to optimize the container classes. The current workaround is to perform a manual optimization called Expression Templates (ETs), which utilizes C++ templates to perform arbitrary code generation, but is a very messy and inefficient way of doing things. We present a compiler alternative to ETs that uses programmer annotations to eliminate temporaries through expression fusion. Our solution is much better for programmer productivity than ETs, and also achieves results that are slightly better. iii Table of Content...|$|R
