5|$|Early {{suggestions}} were to show cutaways {{of just a}} {{small portion}} of the audience, but the full effect was achieved by only showing the back of the audience. To save time, most of the audience models were borrowed from the previous Pixar film, Ratatouille. Additionally, Presto's body (from <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>down)</b> is Skinner's lawyer, and the carrot was one of the many food props from that film.|$|E
5|$|McElhenny {{is related}} to the McIlhenny family of Louisiana, the makers of Tabasco sauce. In his later life, McElhenny was {{diagnosed}} with a rare nerve disorder called Guillain–Barré syndrome, which almost killed him. He was temporarily paralyzed from <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>down</b> and had to use a walker for a year.|$|E
5|$|After rescue, Bågenholm was {{transported by}} {{helicopter}} to the Tromsø University Hospital, where {{a team of}} more than a hundred doctors and nurses worked in shifts for nine hours to save her life. Bågenholm woke up ten days after the accident, paralyzed from <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>down</b> and subsequently spent two months recovering in an intensive care unit. Although she has made an almost full recovery from the incident, late in 2009 she was still suffering from minor symptoms in hands and feet related to nerve injury. Bågenholm's case has been discussed in the leading British medical journal The Lancet, and in medical textbooks.|$|E

5|$|The {{nominate}} population, {{especially in}} Africa, {{is known for}} its use of stones as tools. When a large egg, such as that of an ostrich or bustard, is located, the bird walks up to it with a large pebble held in its bill and tosses the pebble by swinging <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>down</b> over the egg. The operation is repeated until the egg cracks from the blows. They prefer using rounded pebbles to jagged rocks. This behaviour, although it was believed that it was first reported by Jane Goodall in 1966, it was actually already known to Africans and was first reported by J. G. Wood in 1877. However, this has only been reported in Africa and has not been recorded in N. p. ginginianus. Tests with both hand-reared and wild birds suggest that the behaviour is innate, not learnt by observing other birds, and displayed once they associate eggs with food and have access to pebbles. Another case of tool-use described from Bulgaria involves the use of a twig as a tool to roll up and gather strands of wool to use for lining the nest.|$|E
5|$|Meeting Chloe at {{the diner}} where her mother Joyce (Cissy Jones) works, they decide to {{experiment}} with Max's power at Chloe's secret scrapyard hideout. However, strain causes Max to have a nosebleed and faint. Chloe takes her back to Blackwell, but class is halted when everyone is called out to the courtyard. Kate commits suicide by jumping off {{the roof of the}} girls' dorm. Max manages to rewind and time stops unexpectedly as she reaches Kate, giving Max the opportunity to convince her to come down. Max ultimately resolves to uncover what happened to Kate and Chloe's missing friend Rachel Amber. Max and Chloe break into the principal's office that night to investigate and enter the pool for a swim before evading David Madsen (Don McManus), head of security at Blackwell and Chloe's stepfather, and fleeing back to Chloe's place. The next morning, they sneak into the motorhome of Frank Bowers (Daniel Bonjour), drug dealer and friend of Rachel, and learn that Rachel was in a relationship with Frank and lied to Chloe about it, causing Chloe to storm off feeling betrayed. Max returns to her dormitory and examines a childhood photo of her and Chloe, but is suddenly transported to the day the picture was taken. Max prevents Chloe's father William (Joe Ochman) from dying in a traffic collision, which inadvertently creates an alternative reality where William is alive but Chloe has been paralysed from <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>down</b> {{as a result of a}} collision in her own car.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{opposition}} from some groups, the form-fitting style proved popular. It {{was not long}} before swimwear started to shrink further. At first arms were exposed and then legs up to mid-thigh. Necklines receded from around <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>down</b> to around the top of the bosom. The development of new fabrics allowed for new varieties of more comfortable and practical swimwear.|$|E
25|$|This {{play was}} one of several {{attempts}} Alan Ayckbourn made to write a play involving swapping bodies. In 1990, Body Language was premiered, where a fat woman and a thin woman swap bodies from <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>down</b> following a botched operation. And in 2002's The Jollies, a young boy is transported into an adult's body whilst his mother is transported into a young girl's body.|$|E

25|$|At 5:17p.m., the SWAT sniper {{perched on}} the post office roof {{obtained}} an unobstructed view of Huberty from <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>down</b> for a few seconds; he fired a single round, which entered Huberty's chest, severed the aorta just under his heart, and exited through his spine, leaving an exit wound one inch square and sending him sprawling backwards onto the floor {{directly in front of}} the service counter, killing him within seconds.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Judt was {{diagnosed}} with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease.

25|$|On May 27, 1995, Reeve's horse made a refusal. Witnesses {{said that}} the horse began the third fence jump and {{suddenly}} stopped. Reeve fell forward off the horse, {{holding on to the}} reins. His hands somehow became tangled in the reins, and the bridle and bit were pulled off the horse. He landed head first {{on the far side of}} the fence, shattering his first and second vertebrae. This cervical spinal injury, which paralyzed him from <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>down,</b> also halted his breathing. Paramedics arrived three minutes later and immediately took measures to get air into his lungs. He was taken first to the local hospital, before being flown by helicopter to the University of Virginia Medical Center. Afterwards, he had no recollection of the accident. Due to this injury, Armand Assante replaced Reeve for the role of Alan Breck Stewart in Kidnapped.|$|E

50|$|The bilaterally {{symmetric}} sympathetic chain ganglia, {{also called}} the paravertebral ganglia, are located just ventral and lateral to the spinal cord. The chain extends from <b>the</b> upper <b>neck</b> <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> coccyx, forming the unpaired coccygeal ganglion.

50|$|The gown, {{analogous}} to the Western doctoral robe and similar to American judicial attire, is constructed from heavy material, most appropriately of black color, and usually features double-bell sleeves with a cuff (mimicking the cassock once worn under it) and velvet facings (or panels) running over <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> and <b>down</b> {{both sides of the}} front enclosure length-wise, mimicking the ecclesiastical tippet once worn over it.|$|R
25|$|The person {{using the}} iron lung is placed {{into the central}} chamber, a {{cylindrical}} steel drum. An opening allowing {{the head and neck}} to remain outside is then sealed off, forming an air-tight compartment enclosing the rest of the person's body from <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>down.</b> Pumps that control airflow periodically decrease and increase the air pressure within the chamber, and particularly, on the chest. When the pressure is below that within the lungs, the lungs expand and atmospheric pressure pushes air from outside the chamber in via the person's nose and airways to keep the lungs filled; when the pressure goes above that within the lungs, the reverse occurs, and air is expelled. In this manner, the iron lung mimics the physiological action of breathing: by periodically altering intrathoracic pressure, it causes air to flow {{in and out of the}} lungs. The iron lung is a form of non-invasive therapy.|$|E
25|$|A storm forces Krug and {{his gang}} to seek refuge with John and Emma, whose house is nearby. Justin soon realizes that they are Mari's parents, and {{intentionally}} leaves Mari's necklace on the counter to alert them about their daughter. When John and Emma find Mari barely alive on their porch, and the necklace on the counter, they realize {{that the people who}} did this to Mari are in their house. As they try to find the key to their boat so that they can take Mari to the hospital, they decide to get revenge on those responsible. When Francis happens upon Mari, he is attacked and killed by John and Emma. When the couple go after Krug and Sadie, they find Justin in possession of Krug's gun; Justin gives the gun to John so that he can kill Krug. Sadie awakens and interrupts John, allowing Krug to escape from the couple: he then realizes that they are Mari's parents. After Emma shoots Sadie in the head, John chases Krug. With a combined effort from Emma, John, and Justin, Krug is knocked unconscious. John paralyzes Krug from <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>down</b> and leaves him to die with his head in an active microwave oven (his head explodes), then he, Emma, Mari, and Justin take the boat to the local hospital.|$|E
25|$|Spinal {{cord injury}} (SCI) causes damage to nerve roots and fibers that carry {{messages}} {{to and from}} the brain. Spinal cord injuries can result from physical trauma, tumors, developmental disorders or a number of different diseases. In 1995, Christopher Reeve, known for his role in all three Superman movies, was thrown from his horse and landed headfirst into a fence shattering his first and second vertebrae. Reeve’s cervical spinal injury paralyzed him from <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>down.</b> Reeve sought the aid of Dr. John McDonald, who was working at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. After extensive activity-based therapies, Reeve was able to wiggle his toes and move a couple of fingers. Christopher Reeve died in 2004, however his achievements shined light on everyone affected by spinal cord injuries. Dr. McDonald left St. Louis and officially opened the International Center for Spinal Cord Injury (ICSCI) at Kennedy Krieger Institute on June 14, 2005. ICSCI {{is one of the first}} centers to have a focus specifically on children with chronic spinal cord injuries and paralysis. The center utilizes innovative activity-based therapies such as FES cycling, aquatic therapy, and partial weight supported walking to help patients regain sensation and feeling in their bodies. The center combines clinical research with a focus on restoration and rehabilitation for children and adults with chronic paralysis.|$|E

25|$|Earlier in the season, Sue Ellen gets drunk {{after having}} seen J.R. {{in bed with}} Holly Harwood. She gets into a car and Ray Krebbs' cousin Mickey Trotter tries to stop her and they are {{involved}} in an accident, in a car belonging to J.R., just outside Southfork. Sue Ellen emerges with nothing worse than bruises, but Mickey is paralyzed from <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>down</b> and in a coma. In the final episode of the season, Ray finds out that the driver of the other car was Walt Driscoll, J.R.'s rival. He also learns that Driscoll deliberately caused the accident, thinking that J.R. was driving, as a means of revenge for being put in jail by J.R. earlier in the year. An angered Ray comes to Southfork late at night demanding answers from J.R., who was not expecting to see him. J.R. asks him what is going on and Ray says he's going to kill J.R. for what happened. J.R. throws a candle holder at Ray, which misses him and knocks over another candle holder with lit candles in it. As the two brawl, the candles ignite a fire and the smoke starts to creep into both John Ross and Sue Ellen's bedrooms as they sleep. Sue Ellen had been given a sedative by the doctor earlier in the day so she doesn't wake up. J.R. notices the fire and tries to break free of Ray, finally knocking him out with a telephone, and runs upstairs to try to save his wife and son. Ray recovers and runs after J.R. but is consumed by smoke and falls. J.R. is hit with a falling beam as he gets upstairs and both men are unconscious as Southfork burns.|$|E
500|$|Despite initial improvement, Irma Hadžimuratović {{was paralyzed}} from <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>down</b> and {{required}} a ventilator to breathe. She died of septicaemia in Great Ormond Street on 1 April 1995, aged seven, following twenty months in intensive care. The coroner at her inquest called her [...] "a victim of war".|$|E

Singer said Mystique [...] "is less innocent, evolved, {{getting closer to}} where Mystique was in X-Men 2". Lawrence had suffered skin irritations from the full body make-up used in First Class, and the process was changed so from <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>down</b> {{it would be a}} bodysuit, [...] whose zipper was digitally removed in post-production. As a result, the make-up process was reduced from eight hours to three.

50|$|A double chin is a {{layer of}} {{subcutaneous}} fat around <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> that sags <b>down</b> and creates a wrinkle, making the owner {{appear to have a}} second chin. This fat pad is sometimes surgically removed and the muscles under the jaw shortened to remove the double chin.|$|R
50|$|From this origin, the {{inferior}} belly forms a flat, narrow fasciculus, which inclines forward and slightly upward across {{the lower part}} of <b>the</b> <b>neck,</b> being bound <b>down</b> to the clavicle by a fibrous expansion; it then passes behind the sternocleidomastoid, becomes tendinous and changes its direction, forming an obtuse angle.|$|R
50|$|Much {{had been}} done to remedy the worst excesses of the Free State period and the Force Publique had become a more typical colonial army — well disciplined but with an inevitably repressive role. Most askaris were armed with single shot 11 mm Albini Rifles. They {{continued}} to wear the blue uniform (with red trim around <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> front opening), red fez and sash of the Free State period until replaced by khaki during 1915-17. Initial enlistment was for a period of seven years.|$|R
