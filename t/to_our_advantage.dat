The accountants searched {{for new ways to}} save the company money, including capitalizing on loopholes found in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the accounting industry's standards. One Enron accountant revealed [...] "We tried to aggressively use the literature [...] <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>advantage.</b> All the rules create all these opportunities.

500|$|In Game 1 of the Eastern Division Finals, the Celtics met the Syracuse Nationals, {{who were}} led by Dolph Schayes. In Russell's first NBA playoff game, he {{finished}} with 16 points and 31 rebounds, along with a reported 7 blocks. (At the time, blocks were not yet an officially registered statistic.) After the Celtics' 108–89 victory, Schayes quipped, [...] "How much does that guy make a year? It would be <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>advantage</b> if we paid him off for five years {{to get away from}} us in the rest of this series." [...] The Celtics swept the Nationals in three games to earn the franchise's first appearance in the NBA Finals.|$|E

2500|$|In 1209, Genghis {{undertook}} {{his campaign}} to actually conquer Western Xia. Li Anquan requested aid from the Jin dynasty, but the new Jin emperor Wanyan Yongji refused to send aid, stating that [...] "It is <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>advantage</b> when our enemies attack each other. Wherein lies the danger to us?" [...] After defeating a force led by Kao Liang-Hui outside Wulahai, Genghis captured the city and pushed up along the Yellow River, defeating several cities as he went, {{until he reached the}} fortress Kiemen which guarded the only pass through the Helan Mountains to the capital, Yinchuan. Containing an army of up to 70,000, plus 50,000 reinforcements, the fortress proved too difficult to capture, and after a two-month stand-off the Mongols feinted a retreat, luring the garrison, led by Wei-ming Ling-kung, out onto the field where it was easily destroyed. His path now open, Genghis advanced to the capital. Well fortified, Yinchuan held about 150,000 soldiers, nearly twice the size of the Mongol army. One of their first endeavors at siege warfare, the Mongols lacked the proper equipment and experience to take the city. They arrived at the city in May, but by October were still unsuccessful at breaking through. Genghis attempted to flood the capital by diverting the river and its network of irrigation canals into the city, and by January 1210 the walls of Yinchuan were nearly breached. However, the dike used to divert the river broke, and the ensuing flood wiped out the Mongol camp, forcing the Mongols to take higher ground. Despite this setback, the Mongols still posed a threat to Western Xia, and with the state's crops destroyed and no relief coming from the Jin, Li Anquan agreed to submit to Mongol rule, demonstrating his loyalty by giving a daughter, Chaka, in marriage to Genghis and paying a tribute of camels, falcons, and textiles.|$|E

60|$|Many {{things more}} might be {{observed}} on this curious head of our author's speculations. But, taking leave {{of what the}} writer says in his serious part, if he be serious in any part, I shall only just point {{out a piece of}} his pleasantry. No man, I believe, ever denied that the time for making peace is that in which the best terms maybe obtained. But what that time is, together with the use that has been made of it, we are to judge by seeing whether terms adequate <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>advantages,</b> and <b>to</b> <b>our</b> necessities, have been actually obtained. Here is the pinch of the question, to which the author ought to have set his shoulders in earnest. Instead of doing this, he slips out of the harness by a jest; and sneeringly tells us, that, to determine this point, we must know the secrets of the French and Spanish cabinets[55], and that Parliament was pleased to approve the treaty of peace without calling for the correspondence concerning it. How just this sarcasm on that Parliament may be, I say not; but how becoming in the author, I leave it to his friends to determine.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} using Human Interactive Security Protocols (HISPs) {{to secure}} payments. We start our research by conducting extensive {{investigations into the}} payment industry. After interacting with different payment companies and banks, we present two case studies: online payment and mobile payment. We show how to adapt HISPs for payments by establishing the reverse authentication method. In order to properly and thoroughly evaluate different payment examples, we establish two attack models which cover the most commonly seen attacks against payments. We then present our own payment solutions which aim at solving the most urgent security threats revealed in our case studies. Demonstration implementations are also made <b>to</b> show <b>our</b> <b>advantages.</b> In the end we show how to extend the use of HISPs into other domains.

40|$|My {{choice of}} a theme for this evening was {{suggested}} by the topics of my two immediate predecessors in the Harrington Lecture series. In 1985, Theodore Van Bruggen spoke of prairie land resources; and in 1986, Duncan McGregor spoke of the earth's mineral and energy resources. Those natural resources are finite and fragile. And they depend vitally on the activities of another resource: people. By using natural resources <b>to</b> <b>our</b> immediate <b>advantage,</b> we people have quickly (in terms of the span of history) reduced them in quantity and degraded them in quality. As this has continued, we have also succeeded wildly in adding <b>to</b> <b>our</b> own absolute numbers. This has brought even greater exploitation and faster depletion of nonhuman resources. But while all {{that has been going}} on, we have also managed something else — haltingly, some-times with glacial slowness, often with temporary reversals. We have managed to increase resources of human ability. And those human resour-ces, as they are developed, are the ones that allow us better to cope with th...|$|R
