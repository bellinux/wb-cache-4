5|$|The {{different}} plant {{partners are}} reflected in the wide variety of habitats worldwide. Ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae have been observed in arctic and alpine tundra, boreal and alpine forest, north temperate forest, mires, mediterranean forests and scrub (maquis), miombo woodland, tropical lowland rainforest, tropical cloud forest, <b>tropical</b> <b>dry</b> forest, Australian eucalypt woodlands, and south temperate forests. Where they are introduced, they typically grow in plantations of their native host species, e.g. with pine in South Africa, Eucalyptus in Thailand, or birch in New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tropical</b> <b>dry</b> {{deciduous}} {{forests are}} found {{in all parts of}} the plains. Since much sunlight reaches the ground, shrubs and grasses are also abundant. Large tracts of these forests have been cleared for cultivation. Tropical thorny forests, consisting of widely scattered thorny trees, mainly babool are mostly found in the southwestern parts of the state. These forests are confined to areas which have low annual rainfall (50–70cm), a mean annual temperature of 25–27°C and low humidity.|$|E
5|$|The Indian {{climate is}} {{strongly}} influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping {{the bulk of the}} Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, <b>tropical</b> <b>dry,</b> subtropical humid, and montane.|$|E

5|$|There {{is a wide}} {{diversity}} {{of plants and animals}} in South India, resulting from its varied climates and geography. Deciduous forests are found along the Western Ghats while <b>tropical</b> <b>dry</b> forests and scrub lands are common in the interior Deccan plateau. The southern Western Ghats have rainforests located at high altitudes called the South Western Ghats montane rain forests and the Malabar Coast moist forests are found on the coastal plains. The Western Ghats is one of the eight hottest biodiversity hotspots in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.|$|E
5|$|Its {{natural habitat}} is high {{altitude}} subtropical or <b>tropical</b> <b>dry</b> forests composed primarily of African juniper. However, the juniper forests preferred by the francolin are dying, {{so it may}} be found in other habitats, such as box-tree forests. This bird is only known from two locations in Djibouti, one of which is largely unsurveyed. It can be found in small groups and is extremely shy. It is known to feed on berries, seeds, and termites, and it breeds between December and February. It is considered a critically endangered species because it underwent a 90% population decline in twenty years. The degrading of its juniper habitat through man-made disturbances, such as overgrazing, is a major threat to the francolin's survival. Ongoing conservation work includes the restoration of some juniper forest, and surveys to obtain accurate population counts and to raise awareness.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{biodiversity}} is concentrated and protected in the Western Ghats. Three {{quarters of the}} land area of Kerala was under thick forest up to 18th century. , over 25% of India's 15,000 plant species are in Kerala. Out of the 4,000 flowering plant species; 1,272 of which are endemic to Kerala, 900 are medicinal, and 159 are threatened. Its 9,400km2 of forests include tropical wet evergreen and semi-evergreen forests (lower and middle elevations—3,470km2), tropical moist and dry deciduous forests (mid-elevations—4,100km2 and 100km2, respectively), and montane subtropical and temperate (shola) forests (highest elevations—100km2). Altogether, 24% of Kerala is forested. Three of the world's Ramsar Convention listed wetlands—Lake Sasthamkotta, Ashtamudi Lake and the Vembanad-Kol wetlands—are in Kerala, as well as 1455.4km2 of the vast Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Subjected to extensive clearing for cultivation in the 20th century, much of the remaining forest cover is now protected from clearfelling. Eastern Kerala's windward mountains shelter tropical moist forests and <b>tropical</b> <b>dry</b> forests, which are common in the Western Ghats.

The TCUs in tropical moist evergreen forests represent the less common tiger habitats, being largely limited to the upland areas and wetter parts of the Western Ghats, and include the tiger reserves of Periyar, Kalakad-Mundathurai, Bandipur and Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary.|$|E
25|$|Parachartergus fraternus {{is found}} {{throughout}} Central and South America.

P. fraternus wasps typically live in second growth <b>tropical</b> <b>dry</b> forests. A second growth forest is a forest that has regrown after a major disturbance. These wasps build their nests by pasture fields, in roadside areas, and in urban city areas as well. Nests are often directly attached to the smooth surfaces of tree trunks, branches, and walls.|$|E
25|$|In the Indian subcontinent, tigers inhabit {{tropical}} moist evergreen forests, <b>tropical</b> <b>dry</b> forests, tropical and subtropical moist deciduous forests, mangroves, subtropical and temperate upland forests, and alluvial grasslands.

25|$|Most bird pollinated {{flowers are}} red {{and have a}} lot of nectar. They also tend to be unscented. Flowers with generalist pollinators tend to have dilute nectar but those that have {{specialist}} pollinators such as hummingbirds or sunbirds tend to have more concentrated nectar. The nectar of ornithophilous flowers vary in the sugar composition, with hexoses being high in passerine pollinated species while those that are insect pollinated tend to be sucrose rich. Hummingbird pollinated flowers however tend to be sucrose rich. Many plants of the family Loranthaceae have explosive flowers that shower pollen on a bird that forages near it. They are associated mainly with flowerpeckers in the Dicaeidae family. In Australia, some species of Banksia have flowers that open in response to bird actions thereby reducing the wastage of pollen. In <b>tropical</b> <b>dry</b> forests in southern India, ornithophilous flowers were found to bloom mainly in the hot dry season. As many as 129 species of North American plants have evolved ornithophilous associations. Nearly a fourth of the 900 species of the genus Salvia are bird pollinated in the South African region. Tropical China and the adjacent Indochinese countries harbor relatively few bird-pollinated flowers, among them is Rhodoleia championii, a member of the Hamamelidaceae family, which at any one site can be visited and pollinated by up to seven species of nectar-foraging birds, including Japanese white-eyes (Zosterops japonicus, Zosteropidae) and fork-tailed sunbirds (Aethopyga christinae, Nectariniidae).|$|E
