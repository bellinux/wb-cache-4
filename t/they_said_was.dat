In the process of the so-called search, they located weapons in use by the Mexican army, and determined the sizes of units and states of readiness.

The subsequent album Bays was released {{the following year}} on 23 October 2015, reaching the number 1 in New Zealand and 12 In Australia. The album title is derived from their home base in Wellington {{where the majority of}} the album was written. Widening the sphere of influence which colours their music the new album features more electronic flavour in Wheels and Cortina Motors, which seems like a true evolution, and more soulful moments in Makkan where Dallas already resides.|$|E

There were far fewer fires set the night of July 22–23 (only 14), and only a few false alarms.

Bottom was commissioned by the BBC and three series were shown between 1991 and 1995. Mayall appeared in Bottom as Richard 'Richie' Richard alongside Edmondson's Eddie Elizabeth Hitler. The series featured slapstick violence taken to new extremes, and gained a strong cult following.|$|E

The bill was backed by the White House and business groups as an essential tort reform measure that would reduce what <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> a debilitating number of frivolous lawsuits. The bill was opposed by consumer advocacy groups and trial lawyers who argued that many valid claims against corporations would be dismissed, leaving consumers without legal recourse.|$|E

25|$|Jackson was {{selected}} {{with the first}} overall pick of the 1986 NFL Draft by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, {{but he refused to}} play for them because a visit to team facilities <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> NCAA-approved was actually not, causing him to miss the remainder of his final college baseball season. Jackson believes that the failure to obtain NCAA approval was deliberate and was intended by the Buccaneers to get him to play football instead of baseball. He vowed not to sign with Tampa Bay should they draft him, but they proceeded anyway. He kept his vow and opted to play baseball for the Kansas City Royals, the defending World Series champions, who had drafted him in the fourth round in the 1986 amateur draft. He spent 53 games with the Memphis Chicks, the Royals' Class AA minor league affiliate, and was called up to the majors in September 1986. He made the Royals' roster in 1987 and hit 22 home runs, with 53 RBIs and 10 stolen bases as a left fielder.|$|E

25|$|April 10, 2001: Pro-Moscow Grozny mayor Beslan Gantamirov {{announced}} that 17 bodies with gunshot wounds {{had been discovered}} {{in the basement of}} a bombed-out dormitory next to Oktyabrskoye city district police station, manned by the OMON special police troops from Siberia's Khanty-Mansiysk. The next day Gantamirov {{announced that}} his report was false and there were no bodies found. When explaining his change of heart, Gantamirov said that he learned of the discovery from the same source as the Russian envoy to the region Viktor Kazantsev, who also first confirmed the find, but later denied it. The OMON officer in charge of the station claimed the unit had nothing to do with the disappearance of local residents, adding that mass graves in Chechnya are commonplace. In March 2005, one of the unit's officers, Sergey Lapin, was convicted for the torture of a Chechen man who remains missing. In June 2006, Memorial produced what it says is documentary evidence of a secret torture center {{in the basement of a}} former school for deaf children in the Oktyabrsokye district of Grozny, which the Russian police allegedly used to hold, torture and murder hundreds of people. The activists said they collected the evidence just in time before the building housing the cellar was demolished in what <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> a crude attempt at a cover-up.|$|E

The writers found the role of [...] "Blue Demon Dwarf" [...] difficult to cast, but were very happy with the performance of Starkey, who kept some of his character's props. The writers also praised Lowe, who they felt was able {{to make a lot of}} a comparatively small part.

500|$|Prior to broadcast, [...] "Home" [...] {{was listed}} {{as one of the}} {{programmes}} on Entertainment Weeklys [...] "Tonight's Best TV" [...] for October 22.

However, the review praised the additional attention given to Linda Park as Hoshi, saying that she is [...] "possibly the most under-utilized actor on the show and shows the most potential."

500|$|Several critics praised {{this episode}} for its {{character}} development, something that <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> {{missing in the}} previous episodes. Robert Canning of IGN said that although there was still {{plenty of room for}} growth, the episode gave a better understanding of Liz and Jenna's friendship. He felt that prior to the episode, nothing was known about Liz and Jenna's longtime friendship, {{and that there was no}} depth to it. Canning said that Liz's admission of being somewhat jealous of Jenna's success was a much needed storyline for the show, and one that gave the audience something deeper to latch onto. However, Canning pointed out that small hints of what their friendship was like in the past were played for laughs as opposed to establishing any sort of history. Canning found that their verbal sparring really [...] "solidified their bond", and that by the end of the episode the audience had seen their [...] "human side" [...] and the [...] "characters had become people".|$|E

500|$|The Georgia plant's 371 workers {{continued}} to receive payment from Imperial, and 275 were rehired {{to assist with}} cleanup and demolition of parts of the refinery {{that could not be}} salvaged. Work began on April 18, 2008 after Imperial's board confirmed their intention to rebuild. The plan was for the plant to return to sugar refining by the end of 2008. Demolition of the sugar silos was conducted on June 24, 2008 with a wrecking ball. A replacement packaging building and new sugar silos were intended to be completed by summer 2009. During demolition, [...] of fire-hardened sugar were recovered from one silo, and another [...] from the second. The company hoped to recycle the product for ethanol production. In the first quarter of 2008, Imperial posted a $15.5 million loss, which <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> primarily due to the explosion. Port Wentworth suffered an economic depression after the accident, with local businesses losing many customers. Imperial Sugar was purchased in 2012 by the Louis Dreyfus Group.|$|E
500|$|According to Lacombe, [...] is {{characteristic}} of French opéra lyrique, in particular through Bizet's use of arioso and dramatic recitative, his creation of atmospheres, and his evocation of the exotic. Berlioz described the opera's score as beautiful, expressive, richly coloured and full of fire, but Bizet himself did not regard the work highly, and thought that, a few numbers apart, it deserved oblivion. Parisian critics of the day, attuned to the gentler sounds of Auber and Offenbach, complained about the heaviness of Bizet's orchestration, which <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> noisy, overloaded and Wagnerian—"a fortissimo in three acts". The conductor Hans von Bülow dismissed the work contemptuously as [...] "a tragical operetta", {{and when it was}} revived after 1886, resented having to conduct it. Modern writers have generally treated the piece more generously; the music may be of uneven quality and over-reflective of the works of Bizet's contemporaries, says Dean, but there are interesting hints of his mature accomplishments. Others have given credit to the composer for overcoming the limitations of the libretto with some genuinely dramatic strokes and the occasional inspiring melody.|$|E
500|$|According to Santa Monica's senior {{producer}} Whitney Wade {{and director}} of internal development Chacko Sonny, the beta made the team look at the game as an [...] "evolving service".

Wade and Sonny said the testing went as expected, [...] "revealing successive layers of issues that we would address, deploy fixes for, and then monitor in a live environment." [...] The most important change from the beta, <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> <b>was</b> their planning in how to support the game post-launch. The team designed a process that allowed them to [...] "quickly iterate on fixes, deploy them through infrastructure (testing, certification, patching), and coordinate with internal technology partners within Sony." [...] They also developed a system to allow them to monitor, log, and interpret any changes added, and the beta test gave insight on how to prioritize key features.|$|E
