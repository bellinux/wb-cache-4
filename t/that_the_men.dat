5|$|Villagers in {{northern}} Albania and western Kosovo reported hearing explosions {{in the vicinity}} of the ambush and seeing helicopters flying overhead for much of the following day. Albanian officials later alleged that two of these helicopters had violated the country's airspace, and Albania moved elite army units to the Yugoslav border in response. Yugoslav authorities accused Albania of backing the KLA. In response to the ambush, U.S. officials indicated that they would push for sanctions to be re-implemented against Yugoslavia, and said they would look to freeze the country's assets overseas. Some Albanian sources alleged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> had not been ambushed, rather they were abducted and killed by Yugoslav security forces. Such claims could not be verified by Western journalists, and later that year, Amnesty International affirmed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> were killed in an ambush while smuggling weapons across the border.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{additional}} profanity, gore, {{and sexual}} content, {{and a few}} extra lines, the extended version features a few extra scenes. In one scene, Berringer blames the Mayor for the witches' attack and murders him in public. The scene where Berringer and his goons assault Gretel is also extended; it occurs in between the scene where Mina heals Hansel and has sex with him, and shows <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> plan to rape Gretel right before Edward kills them.|$|E
5|$|Bran Stark is {{learning}} how to be the Lord of Winterfell while his older brother is away at war. He has a strange dream, where he sees himself as Summer, his direwolf, running in the Godswood. The next morning, {{he goes to the}} Godswood with Osha, who tries to pry about his dreams, but Bran ignores her questions. The pair notice a red comet in the sky; Bran remarks <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> claim it is an omen of victory for one side or another in the war, but Osha insists it means one thing: dragons have returned.|$|E
60|$|I {{said just}} now <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> {{who will not}} obey, will never rule; <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who will not stoop to be a servant, will never rise to be a master; <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who neglects God's will and mind about things, and will follow his own will and fancy, will {{understand}} nothing, and master nothing, and get comfort out of nothing, either in earth or heaven.|$|R

5|$|During the elections, Ohio {{officials}} were harassed by Michigan {{authorities and the}} area residents were threatened with arrest if they submitted to Ohio's authority. On April 8, 1835, the Monroe County, Michigan sheriff arrived {{at the home of}} Major Benjamin F. Stickney, an Ohio partisan. In the first contact between Michigan partisans and the Stickney family, the sheriff arrested two Ohioans under the Pains and Penalties Act on the basis <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> had voted in the Ohio elections.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Duncan Wood, the BBC's Head of Comedy, {{watched a}} comedy on {{television}} called The Misfit. Impressed by writer Roy Clarke's ability to inject both comedy and drama into the sitcom, Wood offered Clarke {{the opportunity to}} write a sitcom. Clarke nearly turned the job down as {{he felt that the}} BBC's idea for a programme about three old men was a dull concept for a half-hour sitcom. Instead, Clarke proposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> should all be unmarried, widowed, or divorced and either unemployed or retired, leaving them free to roam around like adolescents in the prime of their lives, unfettered and uninhibited.|$|E
5|$|In their Bounty histories, both Hough and Alexander {{maintain}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> {{were not}} at a stage close to mutiny, however sorry they were to leave Tahiti. The journal of James Morrison, the boatswain's mate, supports this. The events that followed, Hough suggests, were determined in the three weeks following the departure, when Bligh's anger and intolerance reached paranoid proportions. Christian was a particular target, always seeming to {{bear the brunt of}} the captain's rages. Unaware of the effects of his behaviour on his officers and crew, Bligh would forget these displays instantly and attempt to resume normal conversation.|$|E

5|$|Jervis had the {{reputation}} as a disciplinarian and {{put in place a}} new system that would ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> in the Mediterranean fleet did not mutiny. To begin with the admiral wrote a new set of standing orders. For example, Jervis divided the seamen and marines and berthed the two separately putting the marines between the officers aft and the men forward. Thus he created an effective barrier between officers and potentially unruly crews.|$|E
5|$|Laura and L. D. {{were taken}} to a bridge over the North Canadian River, six miles west and one mile south of Okemah. The bridge was {{described}} as on the old Schoolton road and at Yarbrough's crossing. According to the Associated Press and The Crisis, Laura was raped. The Ledger reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> gagged Laura and L. D. with tow sacks and, using rope made of half-inch hemp tied in a hangman's knot, hanged them from the bridge. They {{were found in the}} morning hanging 20ft below the middle span. A local resident, John Earnest, reported the discovery to the sheriff's office.|$|E
5|$|On 1 March 1927, Joseph Berchtold {{transferred}} {{leadership of}} the SS to Heiden, who was his acting deputy. Berchtold had become disillusioned by the SA's authority over the SS. As head of the SS, Heiden also {{found it difficult to}} function under the larger and more powerful SA. Under Heiden's leadership a stricter code of discipline was enforced than would have been tolerated in the SA ranks. Heiden further demanded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> under his command were not to be involved in party matters which were none of their concern. His intention was to create a small elite unit and obtain higher quality recruits.|$|E

5|$|On {{arrival at}} Falmouth, England, after a {{crossing}} under filthy conditions, Allen {{and the other}} prisoners were imprisoned in Pendennis Castle, Cornwall. At first his treatment was poor, but Allen wrote a letter, ostensibly to the Continental Congress, describing his conditions and suggesting that Congress treat the prisoners it held the same way. Unknown to Allen, British prisoners now included General Prescott, captured trying to escape from Montreal, and the letter came {{into the hands of}} the British cabinet. Also faced with opposition within the British establishment to the treatment of captives taken in North America, King George decreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> should be sent back to America and treated as prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|Sixty-seven {{officers}} and crew of the two ships were at their stations, and various support personnel were present such as the three-man civilian train crew and a Marine sentry. Nine Navy {{officers and}} 29 armed guards watched over the procedure. A Coast Guard fire barge with a crew of five was docked at the pier. An officer who left the docks shortly after 10p.m. noticed that the Quinault′s propeller was slowly turning over and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> of Division Three were having trouble pulling munitions from the rail cars {{because they had been}} packed so tightly.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{evidence}} submitted by the prosecution {{took the form of}} depositions made by leading Nazis. The defence demanded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> should be brought to Israel so that the defence's right to cross-examination would not be abrogated. But Hausner, in his role as Attorney General, declared that he would be obliged to have any war criminals who entered Israel arrested. The prosecution proved that Eichmann had visited places where exterminations had taken place, including Chełmno extermination camp, Auschwitz, and Minsk (where he witnessed a mass shooting of Jews), and therefore was aware that the deportees were being killed.|$|E

5|$|South Wales miners, {{including}} those at Universal, were paid on a rate {{determined by the}} Sliding Scale Committee, which fixed wages on the price coal fetched at market. When the price of coal slumped in the late 1890s, low wages led to industrial unrest and, in 1898, a strike <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> at Universal joined {{at the end of}} April. The Monmouthshire and South Wales Coal Owners' Association refused to replace the scale, and the strike ended on 1 September with some small concessions granted by the owners. The colliery resumed production and in 1899 was producing 3,000 long tons (3,400short tons) of coal a week.|$|E
5|$|Sudarto {{orders the}} chief executed, a deed which {{ultimately}} {{falls on the}} man's son. Afterwards the division continues west. One night, Sudarto's second-in-command Adam tells him <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> are restless over his relationship with Widya. They argue, and Widya– who has overheard everything– says that she will go. The following morning Dutch soldiers launch an ambush in which many are killed, including Widya and Adam. The division in dire straits, Sudarto offers to go to nearby Bandung on his own for the much-needed supplies, leaving his fellow officer Leo in charge. After meeting with resistance fighters who offer supplies, Sudarto goes to visit Connie and is captured by Dutch forces.|$|E
5|$|Tablighi Jamaat {{has also}} been criticized within Islamic circles and the major {{opposition}} in the Indian subcontinent comes from the Barelvi movement. One of the main criticisms against them is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on da'wa tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.|$|E

5|$|The jailer said that, after {{struggling}} for two hours, he escaped {{and raised the}} alarm at Moon's restaurant {{across the road from}} the jail. Sheriff Dunnegan sent out a search party to no avail. According to the Ledger, a fence post suspended on two chairs across a window was found in the jury room just after the lynching, near the cell where Laura had been held. It was thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> had intended to hang Laura out of the window, but were deterred by an electric light burning nearby.|$|E
5|$|The {{posters of}} Gardstein proved effective, and late on New Year's Day {{a member of}} the public came forward to provide {{information}} about Svaars and Sokoloff. The informant told police <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> were hiding at 100 Sidney Street, along with a lodger, Betty Gershon, who was Sokoloff's mistress. The informant was persuaded to visit the property the following day to confirm the two men were still present. A meeting took place on the afternoon of 2 January to decide the next steps. Wensley, high-ranking members of the Metropolitan force and Sir William Nott-Bower, the Commissioner of the City Police, were present.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) {{calls in}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and informs her that four African American {{men have been}} kidnapped in Philadelphia. One of them has been found dead exhibiting depigmentation. A {{specialist}} from the CDC believes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> have died from a disease, and has requested Scully to investigate the case. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) joins Scully and {{has some of the}} evidence samples from Sanders' autopsy analyzed by Agent Pendrell, who finds a seed from a rare West African passionflower. Mulder takes the seed to his UN informant Marita Covarrubias and asks for her help; she provides him with information on the incident on the plane.|$|E
