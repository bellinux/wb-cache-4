5|$|A well-educated landowning aristocrat, Edwards {{deliberately}} cultivated {{the image}} of the natural leader. Thomas Ford writes that he continued <b>to</b> <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> an 18th-century gentleman long after such fashions had gone out of style, and that his public speaking was marked by showy eloquence. Edwards consciously positioned himself in the select class of men who dominated Kentucky and, later, Illinois politics. In 1803 in Russellville, Edwards married Elvira Lane, a relative from Maryland.|$|E
5|$|The landed {{aristocracy}} of Spanish descent {{considered the}} illiterate, mixed-race gauchos, who comprised {{the majority of}} the population, to be ungovernable and untrustworthy. The gauchos were tolerated because there was no other labor force available, but were treated with contempt by the landowners. Rosas got along well with the gauchos in his service, despite his harsh and authoritarian comportment. He was known <b>to</b> <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> them, joke with them, take part in their horse-play, and pay them well, but he never allowed them to forget that he was their master rather than their equal. Shaped by the colonial society in which he lived, Rosas was conservative, an advocate of hierarchy and authority, like the other great landowners in the region.|$|E
25|$|Dunyasha – a housemaid. Like Lopakhin, she {{is another}} example of social {{mobility}} in Russia at the time. A peasant who is employed as the Gayev's chambermaid, Dunyasha is an attention seeker, making big scenes and dressing as a lady to show herself off. She is in some respects representative of the aristocracy's impotence, as a lowly chambermaid would not in the past have had the freedom <b>to</b> <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> a lady and flirt with the manservants. Although pursued romantically by Yepikhodov, she is in love with Yasha, attracted to the culture he has picked up in Paris.|$|E

25|$|Almost a {{third of}} the group died of {{hardship}} and illness during the long journey. Upon their arrival in the Holy Land, they immediately went to Jerusalem. Within days, their leader, Rabbi Yehuda he-Hasid, died. They borrowed money from local Arabs {{for the construction of a}} synagogue but soon ran out of funds and borrowed more money at very high rates of interest (disputed). In 1720, when they were unable to repay their debts, Arab creditors broke into the synagogue, set it on fire, and destroyed their homes. The Jews fled the city and over the next century, any Jew dressed in Ashkenazi garb was a target of attack. Some of the Ashkenazi Jews who remained began <b>to</b> <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> Sephardi Jews. One known example is Rabbi Abraham Gershon of Kitov.|$|E
500|$|The album's release {{coincided with}} a change in Nico's look, when she adopted {{what has been called}} a [...] "gothic horror princess" [...] persona and [...] "switched from dyed blonde to dark henna and started wearing black, heavy fabrics and boots". As a result, in {{addition}} to being a musical prototype for the goth subculture, Nico became a visual one as well. Claire Marie Healy wrote, [...] "Nico's visual statement of these years speaks of the power that comes with creating a new persona for yourself" [...] and she described the singer as [...] "the first ever goth girl". By the early 1980s, many women began <b>to</b> <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> Nico; nicknamed [...] "Nico-teens", they were the first goth girls, encouraging a cult following for the singer.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s Kirchherr and her art school friends were {{involved}} in the European existentialist movement whose followers were later nicknamed [...] "Exis" [...] by Lennon. In 1995 she told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "Our philosophy then, because we were only little kids, was wearing black clothes and going around looking moody. Of course, we hadn't a clue who Jean-Paul Sartre was. We got inspired by all the French artists and writers, because that was the closest we could get. England was so far away, and America was out of the question. So France was the nearest. So we got all the information from France, and we tried <b>to</b> <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> the French existentialists... We wanted to be free, we wanted to be different, and tried to be cool, as we call it now." ...|$|E

Upon becoming Doge he took <b>to</b> <b>dressing</b> <b>like</b> Lorenzo Celsi, who had been known for his elegance of dress. In his accession's year, Venice begun a successful war against Padua and its lord, Francesco da Carrara, leading to a substantial expansion of the republic in the Italian mainland.

500|$|Buffy the Vampire Slayer {{developed}} an enthusiastic fan following while it aired. Following its series finale, fans continued their appreciation in theater showings of [...] "Once More, with Feeling" [...] where attendees are encouraged <b>to</b> <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> the show's characters, sing {{along to the}} musical numbers, and otherwise interact {{in the style of}} The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Clinton McClung, a New York-based film programmer, got the idea for a sing-along from audience-participation showings of The Sound of Music in 2003. The next year, he began putting on sing-alongs to [...] "Once More, with Feeling" [...] in Boston's Coolidge Corner Theater, which became so popular that it went on the road. Audience members received props to use during key scenes, as well as directions (for example, to yell [...] "Shut up, Dawn!" [...] at Buffy's younger sister), and a live cast performed the episode alongside the screen.|$|E
500|$|Achieving Darla's {{look was}} a {{struggle}} for Benz. She said: [...] "Taking that makeup off, {{it was like having}} six layers of skin ripped off your face every time. It was miserable and the contact lenses were terrible. I don’t wear contacts and I don’t know how people do it, sticking things in their eyeballs all the time." [...] The character's sense of fashion is vital to understanding her past. Benz says Darla is [...] "dressed to the nines" [...] in every time period in which she lives, and [...] "she fully goes after a certain look. If she’s going to be living during the Boxer Rebellion time, she’s got the big Gibson Girl hair style and the beautiful kimono-style clothes." [...] Benz points out that in the Buffy pilot episode, Darla—attempting <b>to</b> <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> a high school student—exaggerates it with a [...] "little twist", wearing a Catholic schoolgirl uniform instead. [...] "I think I influenced Darla fashion-wise in the second season of Angel where she was a little more classic-looking and tailored," [...] Benz says, explaining she collaborated with the costume designer to transition Darla into a [...] "hipper look" [...] when she became a vampire again. Darla shockingly becomes pregnant in the third season of Angel. In an interview with the BBC, Benz admitted: ...|$|E

2500|$|Hoppus began <b>to</b> <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> {{frontman}} Robert Smith, donning eyeliner and [...] "occasionally {{bright red}} lipstick" [...] to {{his high school}} classes ("This all went over exceedingly well with the faculty and staff in the small desert town where I grew up," [...] Hoppus remarked in 2009). Beginning in his first year, Hoppus gained solace through music of both The Cure and The Smiths. Hoppus played by himself and sang in the band Pier 69, primarily covering songs by The Cure, and recorded a live demo with a group named The Attic Children in 1988, featuring covers of The Cure songs. Hoppus returned to Ridgecrest in 1989, completing high school at Burroughs High School. In his teen years, a friend of Hoppus would steal his mother's car {{in the middle of}} the night and pick Hoppus up; the two would sneak out to the desert and burn trees and any objects they could find.|$|E
2500|$|However, UGO Networks listed Birdo as the 20th [...] "unsexiest sexy {{video game}} {{character}}s". Birdo was ranked the ninth ugliest female video game character by ScrewAttack, who described her as resembling a [...] "retarded anteater". ScrewAttack also listed Birdo {{as one of}} 15 reasons why they [...] "hate" [...] Super Mario Bros. 2, claiming that they still have no idea exactly what Birdo is. Games.net placed Birdo at #8 of their [...] "Top Ten Disturbingly Sexual Game Characters" [...] list. GameDaily listed Birdo {{as one of the}} 10 worst Mario characters, stating that [...] "if Birdo wants <b>to</b> <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> a chick, all power to him. Eggs from the mouth, however... that's nasty." [...] MTV Multiplayer editor Jason Cipriano questioned why Birdo and fellow Super Mario Bros. 2 enemy Shy Guy have been included in so many spin-off titles in the Mario series, commenting that they both [...] "kinda suck", but enemies such as Wart and Mouser do not.|$|E
2500|$|Jordan Chandler, who was 25 at {{the time}} of the trial, chose to leave the country rather than testify, and the only person in his family who {{appeared}} for questioning was his mother, June. She denied having seen any molestation, but talked about Jordan and Michael sleeping in the same room on numerous occasions, explaining that she initially didn't want them to, but was persuaded by Jackson, who had cried and been hurt that she didn't trust him. She testified about Jackson buying all kinds of gifts for the family, the trips they'd been on together, and how fun it was to be part of Jackson's world. She said she'd been concerned that her son was starting <b>to</b> <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> Jackson and wanting to spend all his time with him. When asked about the lawsuits that resulted from her family's involvement with Michael Jackson, June Chandler made the distinction that even though she was listed as a plaintiff and received settlement money, it was not she who sued Jackson, but rather Jordan and his father Evan who did so. [...] She claimed not to recall that Jackson had counter sued for extortion, or that her second husband, Dave Schwartz, had sued Jackson, or that Evan Chandler had sued Jackson a second time. Thomas Mesereau said in a Harvard lecture later that year, [...] "the prosecutors tried to get [...] to show up, and he wouldn't. If he had, I had witnesses who were going to come in and say he told them it never happened and that he would never talk to his parents again for what they made him say. It turned out he'd gone into court and got legal emancipation from his parents." [...] June Chandler testified that she had not spoken to her son Jordan in 11 years, since 1994.|$|E
