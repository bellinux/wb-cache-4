The reader would type the BASIC program listing {{into the computer}} by hand, run it, and could save it to <b>tape</b> <b>for</b> later use. Software distributed in this way was in general simpler and slower than its assembly language counterparts. Magazines printed long lists of checksummed hexadecimal digits with machine code games or tools.|$|E

He is also a prolific reader of books on <b>tape</b> <b>for</b> the blind; a 1987 Los Angeles Times article stated that {{at the time he was}} the coordinator of the prison's program and had personally spent over 5,000 hours narrating books with several hundred completed recordings to his name.|$|E

Michael later bothers Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) with an impression of the Popeye cartoon character J. Wellington Wimpy. Dwight makes repeated calls to WEZX Rock 107, a Scranton radio station that plays classic rock. Michael snidely compares Darryl and Roy's work to , an American reality television series providing home improvements for less fortunate families and community schools.|$|E

5|$|Hardy, {{along with}} his brother Jeff and friends, started their own federation, the Trampoline Wrestling Federation (TWF) and mimicked the moves they saw on television. Shortly after Hardy sent in a <b>tape</b> <b>for</b> the World Championship Wrestling (WCW) Amateur Challenge using the ring name High Voltage, a tag team named High Voltage began {{competing}} in WCW, causing Hardy to change his name to Surge. A few years later, it was revealed to him by Chris Kanyon that the tape had been kept in the WCW Power Plant, watched multiple times, and that the name High Voltage was blatantly stolen from it. Beginning in 1994, The Hardys wrestled for several North Carolina-based independent circuit promotions and adapted a number of alter-egos. As The Wolverine, Hardy captured the New England Wrestling Alliance (NEWA) Championship in May 1994. As High Voltage, he teamed with Venom to claim the New Frontier Wrestling Association (NFWA) Tag Team Championship in March 1995. A month later, High Voltage defeated the Willow for the NFWA Championship.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, an 11-year-old Kylie Minogue was {{established}} as a child actress, appearing as a cameo actress in the TV series The Sullivans and Skyways. Both Minogue and her sister Dannii Minogue were both child stars trying to achieve success in the TV industry of Australia, but Dannii received better opportunities as a TV actress than Kylie. In 1985, Kylie was cast {{as one of the}} lead roles on TV soap The Henderson Kids but her role only lasted one season, and was completed after two seasons. Interested in following a career in music, she made a demo <b>tape</b> <b>for</b> the producers of the weekly music programme Young Talent Time, which featured Dannii as a regular performer. Kylie gave her first television singing performance on the show in 1985 but was not invited to join the cast. Dannii's success overshadowed Kylie's acting achievements, until Kylie was cast in the soap opera Neighbours in 1986, as Charlene Mitchell, a schoolgirl turned garage mechanic. Neighbours achieved popularity in the UK, and a story arc that created a romance between her character and the character played by Jason Donovan, culminated in a wedding episode in 1987 that attracted an audience of 20million British viewers.|$|E

25|$|Purely {{electronic}} circuit elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents, {{at the same}} time that digital calculation replaced analog.

25|$|Some {{companies}} {{included a}} complimentary blank cassette with their portable cassette recorders {{in the early}} 1980s. Panasonic's was a C14 and came with a song recorded on side one, and a blank side two. Except for C74 and C100, such non-standard lengths always {{have been hard to}} find, and tend to be more expensive than the more popular lengths. Home taping enthusiasts may have found certain lengths useful for fitting an album neatly on one or both sides of a <b>tape.</b> <b>For</b> instance, the initial maximum playback time of Compact Discs was 74 minutes, explaining the relative popularity of C74 cassettes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1994, he {{discovered}} grunge music and would often be absent from school. On New Year's Eve of 1994, Nanao decided to write music, by humming tunes and writing down lyrics, and throughout the next year began writing songs daily. After copying the styles of several bands he enjoyed, Nanao found songwriting a spontaneous activity. In 1996, {{after a year of}} high school, Nanao decided to drop out of high school, and in September took a friend's acoustic guitar and multitrack recorder and moved to Tokyo. In a year's time in 1997, Nanao sent in a demo <b>tape</b> <b>for</b> the Sony Soytzer Music Audition, which led to Nanao being signed to Sony.|$|E
25|$|The {{period between}} 1947 and 1950 {{was one of}} intense {{compositional}} activity for Boulez, including the Sonatine pour flûte et piano, the first two piano sonatas and initial versions of two cantatas on texts by René Char, Le Visage nuptial and Le Soleil des eaux. In October 1951, whilst Boulez was in London, a large work for eighteen solo instruments, Polyphonie X, caused a scandal at its première at the Donaueschingen Festival, some audience members disrupting the performance with hisses and whistles. He also experimented {{for the first time}} with electronic music, producing Deux Etudes for magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>for</b> Pierre Schaeffer's Groupe Recherche de la Radiodiffusion Française but he was dissatisfied with the results and withdrew them.|$|E
