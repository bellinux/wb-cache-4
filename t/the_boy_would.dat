5|$|Linnaeus {{entered the}} Växjö Katedralskola in 1724, {{where he studied}} mainly Greek, Hebrew, {{theology}} and mathematics, a curriculum designed for boys preparing for the priesthood. In the {{last year at the}} gymnasium, Linnaeus' father visited to ask the professors how his son's studies were progressing; to his dismay, most said that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> never become a scholar. Rothman believed otherwise, suggesting Linnaeus could have a future in medicine. The doctor offered to have Linnaeus live with his family in Växjö and to teach him physiology and botany. Nils accepted this offer.|$|E
25|$|Michael {{wrote to}} Nicholas {{asking him to}} legitimise George so, he argued, that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> be {{provided}} for {{in the event of}} Michael's death at the front.

25|$|George was baptised on 22 September 1910 at the Church of St Basil of Caesarea in Moscow, by Father Peter Pospelov, {{and named}} after his late uncle, Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia, {{who had died}} in 1899. His godparents were Aleksei Matveev and Margaret Abakanovich. Matveev was the husband of George's {{maternal}} aunt, Olga, and Abakanovich was a family friend who was married to Michael's adjutant. Abakanovich was absent, and George's half-sister, Natalia Sergeyevna Mamontova, Natalia's daughter from her first marriage, stood proxy. On 13 November 1910, Emperor Nicholas II decreed that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> be known as George Mikhailovich Brasov, with the surname taken from one of Michael's estates: Brasovo near Orel.|$|E
25|$|Kittie was his father's second wife. Years before Archie's birth, George Belaney had {{emigrated to}} the United States with his then-wife Elizabeth Cox and her younger sister Katherine (Kittie). After Elizabeth's early death, George persuaded Kittie, not yet 20, to marry him, a {{marriage}} {{that would have been}} illegal in Britain. Within the year they returned to Britain in time for the birth of their son Archie. The family lived together near Hastings until Kittie became pregnant for a second time. George and Kittie Belaney left to return to the United States, where he abandoned her. Archie remained in England in the care of his father's mother Juliana Belaney and his father's two younger sisters, Julia Caroline Belaney and Janet Adelaide Belaney, whom <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> know as Aunt Carry and Aunt Ada. Kittie visited him a few times.|$|E
25|$|During the {{negotiations}} regarding the succession to the throne, she supported the Gustavian Party, who wished for the deposed King's son, the former Crown Prince Gustav, {{to be acknowledged}} as heir to the throne. During a dinner, General Baron Georg Adlersparre told her that Jean Baptiste Bernadotte had asked him whether her spouse (Charles XIII) had any issue, and was interested when he found that he had not. When she remarked that the throne had an heir in the deposed King's son, Adlersparre stated {{that none of the}} instigators of the coup would accept this, as they feared that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> avenge his father when he became King, and that to prevent this they would go as far as to take up the old rumor that the deposed King was in fact the illegitimate son of Queen Sophia Magdalena and Count Adolf Fredrik Munck af Fulkila.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} <b>the</b> day, <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> play sports, boxing, {{or other}} leisure activities, or have hockey or rugby league {{training}} if the weather was suitable. Weekends revolved mainly around sports. Field hockey, rugby league, and other sports were commonly played during the winter time. <b>The</b> <b>boys</b> of <b>the</b> orphanage had a well-known reputation in Goulburn for their sports abilities; boys who participated in tournaments and games usually did well, winning many trophies. The orphanage also had a football team. Sometimes, <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> hold fetes or participate in annual concerts and operettas, where they would sing and dance.|$|R

25|$|Then, a {{rainstorm}} strikes the city, threatening {{to cancel the}} game for which Juror 7 has tickets. Juror 4 doubts the boy's alibi of being at the movies, {{because he could not}} recall it in much detail. Juror 8 tests how well Juror 4 remembers previous days, which he does, with difficulty. Juror 2 questions the likelihood that the boy, who was more than half a foot shorter than his father, could have inflicted the downward stab wound found in the body. Next, Jurors 3 and 8 conduct an experiment to see whether a shorter person could stab downwards on a taller person. The experiment proves the possibility, but Juror 5 steps up and demonstrates the correct way to hold and use a switchblade; revealing that anyone skilled with a switchblade, as <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> be, would always stab underhanded at an upwards angle against an opponent who was taller than they, as the grip of stabbing downwards would be too awkward and the act of changing hands too time-consuming.|$|E
25|$|Sigismund {{was officially}} deposed from {{the throne of}} Sweden by a Riksdag held in Stockholm on 24 July 1599. He was given six months to say whether he wanted to send his son, Prince Władysław Vasa, to Sweden as his successor, under the {{condition}} that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> be brought up in the Evangelical faith. Otherwise the Estates would look for a new king. In February 1600, Duke Charles summoned the Estates of the Realm to Linköping. Since Sigismund had not provided a reply, the Estates elected Duke Charles as King Charles IX of Sweden. The consequences for those who had supported Sigismund were devastating. The most prominent among them were killed by the new King in the Linköping Bloodbath. During the winter and spring of 1600, Charles also occupied the Swedish part of Estonia, as the castle commanders had shown sympathies towards Sigismund. Charles' invasion of Livonia led to a series of wars with Poland, starting with the Second Polish–Swedish War. Charles accepted the crown as Charles IX in 1604.|$|E

500|$|Like {{many of the}} {{conversation}} poems, Frost at Midnight touches on Coleridge's idea of [...] "One Life", which connects mankind to nature and to God.

500|$|Frost at Midnight {{uses the}} idea of [...] "One Life" [...] as the poem {{describes}} the idea life that Coleridge's child will experience in the countryside. Coleridge hoped that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> become a [...] "child of nature" [...] and raised free of the constraints that come from a disconnection from nature. Fears in Solitude describes the unity of mankind and nature, which manifests {{in the form of}} fearing for his fellow countrymen in times of invasion. This idea of [...] "One Life", according to Abrams, [...] "best epitomize the Romantic constellation of joy, love, and the shared life".|$|E

500|$|Ascanio was {{expected}} to be the lesser of the works for the wedding celebration, second to Hasse's opera Ruggiero. However, the 72-year-old Hasse was out of touch with current theatrical tastes, and although his opera was praised by the Dowager Empress Maria Theresa, its overall reception was lukewarm, especially compared to the triumphant success of Ascanio. Leopold expressed delight at this turn of events: [...] "The archduke has recently ordered two copies", he wrote home. [...] "All the noblemen and other people constantly address us in the street to congratulate Wolfgang. In short! I'm sorry, Wolfgang's Serenata has so crushed Hasse's opera that I can't describe it." [...] Hasse was gracious about his eclipse, and is said to have remarked that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> cause all others to be forgotten.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} in August 2003, Takako Shimura stated that the theme of Wandering Son {{is similar to the}} second half of her previous manga series Shikii no Jūnin. Shimura took the junior high school teacher Kentarō Kaneda from Shikii no Jūnin and inserted him into Wandering Son, where he teaches at Shuichi's junior high school, because she really liked his character. Shimura originally planned to use a female high school student who wants to become a boy as the main character. However, she realized that a boy who wants to become a girl before entering into puberty would have many worries related to growing up, and changed the story accordingly. Shimura used her realization that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> go through significant changes as he grew up to deepen the development of the story and characters. The Japanese title, Hōrō Musuko, is a pun on , meaning [...] "prodigal son".|$|E
500|$|In {{some regions}} of {{southern}} Montenegro, {{such as the}} Bay of Kotor, Grbalj, and Zagarač, and in parts of Herzegovina, a man who acted as a zduhać was called a vjedogonja or jedogonja. There was a rule: if a child {{was born with a}} caul, the girl would become a vještica [...] "witch", and <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> become a vjedogonja. This could have been prevented by cutting the caul on a trough for feeding dogs, and throwing it away; the child would then grow up into an ordinary person. While the zduhaći and vjedogonje (plural) protected their community from the threats coming from the outside, the witches were the enemy within, doing harm primarily to their own relatives and friends. A correspondence between the witches and the vjedogonje can be seen in a passage from The Mountain Wreath, a poetic drama by Petar II Petrović-Njegoš, the plot of which takes place in 18th-century Montenegro: ...|$|E
