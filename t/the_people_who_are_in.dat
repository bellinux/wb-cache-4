5|$|The video {{starts with}} Jason Wade in the driver's {{seat of a}} car, with {{the other members of}} Lifehouse in the car with him. The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members get out of the car, and begin walking in the opposite direction of the crowd {{to the other side of}} the tunnel. Wade pushes through <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> a rush to get to the entrance of the tunnel and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics cleaning up the mess. Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He then looks to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks into the other car, he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in the car with the band members, however everyone seems to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel for no apparent reason.|$|E
2500|$|Growth {{continued}} until about 2003, but has generally followed the trends {{of the larger}} music industry since that point. In 2009 a The New York Times op-ed placed the entire music industry on a [...] "deathwatch," [...] pointing out that new forms of media, piracy, and new pricing options are driving gross sales down. In another example of parallelism, the Christian music industry has experienced largely the same phenomenon. In the Christian marketplace, music consumption has risen {{by as much as}} 30% since 2005, but overall album sales have dropped to about half of their 1999 levels. However, some critics point out that the current downturn may have long term positive effects for the industry. John J. Thompson told Christianity Today that [...] "The lack of monetary benefit has filtered out {{some of the people who}} should not have been doing this in the first place. If <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> it for the money are gone, it leaves more turf for those who had something a little bit loftier in mind." ...|$|E

The {{partnership}} between one of the industry’s leading jewelry houses and the world’s largest independent international organization running programs in developing and developed countries has generated over AED 98 million and benefited under-privileged children in 23 countries around the globe. [...] El Roumi is responsible for the overall direction, leadership, and coordination of Save the Children programs in Jordan as it was told in the press conference that took place at Al Bustan Hotel- Lebanon, {{in the presence of a}} crowd of Lebanese journalists and dignitaries. The renowned Spanish photographer Fabrizio Ferri has actively supported this initiative with his time and talent. Over the years, he has photographed over 200 celebrities wearing the ring and the pendant in support of Bvlgari’s commitment to quality schooling for the world’s neediest children including Majida, whose poster was officially launched during the press conference. Majida clearly stated during the press conference [...] "I will strive to bring joy to my surroundings and to <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> need of it. Everything that's happening is a crime in every meaning of the word. I feel that I have a mission and my appointment is for a cause that I truly believe in. I will travel the extra mile and do what I can regardless of the size of my mission." [...] She also [...] added, “There is no financial rewards for my participation in this humanitarian effort, as financial things do not bring happiness.” ...|$|E

[...] "I haven't time to explain,--she's coming to now, if you'll all let her alone! All I've {{time to say}} is, that those who had husbands in the old {{graveyard}} and might perhaps be inclined to move them and put up monuments, {{had the right to}} be first spoken to. Although, of course, it's a subject which everybody doesn't care to speak about, and as for Mrs. Ferguson, it's no wonder, knowing her as we do, that she went off in this way when she knew what I was going to say, although, in fact, I wasn't in the least thinking of Mr. Ferguson!" ...|$|E
60|$|The only truth {{which she}} could {{discover}} was {{the truth of what}} she herself felt--a frail beam when compared with the broad illumination shed by the eyes of all <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> agreement to see together; but having rejected the visionary voices, she {{had no choice but to}} make this her guide through the dark masses which confronted her. She tried to follow her beam, with an expression upon her face which would have made any passer-by think her reprehensibly and almost ridiculously detached from the surrounding scene. One would have felt alarmed lest this young and striking woman were about to do something eccentric. But her beauty saved her from the worst fate that can befall a pedestrian; people looked at her, but they did not laugh. To seek a true feeling among the chaos of the unfeelings or half-feelings of life, to recognize it when found, and to accept the consequences of the discovery, draws lines upon the smoothest brow, while it quickens the light of the eyes; it is a pursuit which is alternately bewildering, debasing, and exalting, and, as Katharine speedily found, her discoveries gave her equal cause for surprise, shame, and intense anxiety. Much depended, as usual, upon the interpretation of the word love; which word came up again and again, whether she considered Rodney, Denham, Mary Datchet, or herself; and in each case it seemed to stand for something different, and yet for something unmistakable and something not to be passed by. For the more she looked into the confusion of lives which, instead of running parallel, had suddenly intersected each other, the more distinctly she seemed to convince herself that there was no other light on them than was shed by this strange illumination, and no other path save the one upon which it threw its beams. Her blindness in the case of Rodney, her attempt to match his true feeling with her false feeling, was a failure never to be sufficiently condemned; indeed, she could only pay it the tribute of leaving it a black and naked landmark unburied by attempt at oblivion or excuse.|$|E
