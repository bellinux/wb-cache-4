5|$|In March 2013, La Brugeoise subway {{carriages}} {{were replaced}} by new Chinese 200 Series rolling stock, just 11 months prior to their 100-year anniversary on the line. The original rolling stock has since been maintained, some in exhibition and some being converted to 1500v to run tourist services on the line. During the festivities of the 100-year anniversary of the underground on 1 December 2013, many restored La Brugeoise trains circulated Line A {{and there was a}} symphonic orchestra at Plaza de Mayo station as well as free rides for the entire city in order to mark the event.

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>week</b> <b>that</b> {{followed}} the brigade undertook defensive duties as the Germans attempted to apply {{pressure on the}} beachhead by infiltrating the defensive positions on the eastern flank. On 12 June, the airborne troops launched {{an attack on the}} village of Breville from where German artillery had been shelling them during the preceding week. Although successful, British casualties were high. Having been subjected to an intense artillery barrage, No. 6 Commando suffered 16 casualties. The barrage also wounded the brigade commander, Lord Lovat, to the extent that No. 6 Commando's commanding officer, Mills-Roberts, although wounded himself, was asked to take over from him. Major Anthony Lewis, formerly of the Dorset Regiment, stepped up to take over as commanding officer temporarily, before being confirmed in the role on 24 June and receiving a promotion to acting-lieutenant colonel. He remained in command until 8 August 1944, when Lieutenant Colonel Charles Courtney-Coade of the South Staffordshire Regiment took over, and Lewis reverted to the role of second-in-command.|$|E
5|$|Lawson {{was next}} signed to BBC Two {{to host a}} three-part cookery show {{entitled}} Nigella's Christmas Kitchen, which began on 6 December 2006 and aired weekly. The first two episodes secured the second highest ratings of the week for BBC Two, with the first episode debuting with a strong 3.5 million.

Her influence as a food commentator was also demonstrated in late 2006, when after she had lauded goose fat as being an essential ingredient for Christmas, sales percentages of the product increased significantly in the UK. Waitrose and Tesco both stated that goose fat sales had more than doubled, as well as Asda's goose fat sales increasing by 65% from the previous week. Similarly, after she advised using prunes in a recipe on Nigella's Christmas Kitchen, Waitrose had increased sales of 30% year on year.|$|E

5|$|On 21 October 1805, the French and Spanish allied fleet {{was almost}} {{destroyed}} at the Battle of Trafalgar by a Royal Navy fleet under Vice-Admiral Lord Nelson. Among the scattered {{survivors of the}} Allied fleet were five French frigates, untouched during the action. With {{the rest of the}} surviving ships, the frigates anchored in Cadiz during <b>the</b> <b>week</b> <b>that</b> followed the battle and remained there {{for the rest of the}} year, contained in the harbour by a large British blockade squadron led by Vice-Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth. In December 1805 however, Duckworth abandoned the station in search of a French squadron under Vice-Admiral Zacharie Allemand that was raiding British convoys off the Savage Islands. Although Allemand escaped Duckworth, the British admiral became embroiled in the Atlantic campaign of 1806 and did not return to Cadiz, eventually sailing to the Caribbean where he won the Battle of San Domingo on 6 February 1806. In his absence, Duckworth's squadron was replaced at Cadiz by ships grudgingly despatched from the Mediterranean Fleet, under the command of Vice-Admiral Lord Collingwood.|$|E
