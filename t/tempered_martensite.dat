5000|$|Stainless steels may be {{classified}} by their crystalline structure into three main types: austenitic, ferritic and martensitic.

The results revealed that Micro-hardness did not only depend on the content of martensites, since the hardness of WM was higher than that of BM, but the martensites content of BM was much more than that in WM. The precipitation of carbides increased as the width of lathy <b>tempered</b> <b>martensites</b> grows larger, which caused the hardness increasing and the corrosion resistance decreasing.

50|$|If the {{thickness}} of the coating on the edge is balanced just right with the temperature of the water, the proper hardness can be produced without the need for tempering. However, in most cases, the edge will end up being too hard, so tempering the entire blade evenly for a short time is usually required to bring the hardness down to a more suitable point. The ideal hardness is usually between HRc58-60 on the Rockwell hardness scale. Tempering is performed by heating the entire blade evenly to around 400 F, reducing the hardness in the martensite and turning it into a form of <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite.</b> The pearlite, on the other hand, does not respond to tempering, and does not change in hardness.|$|E
5000|$|Tempering {{involves}} a three-step {{process in which}} unstable martensite decomposes into ferrite and unstable carbides, and finally into stable cementite, forming various stages of a microstructure called <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite.</b> The martensite typically consists of laths (strips) or plates, sometimes appearing acicular (needle-like) or lenticular (lens-shaped). Depending on the carbon content, it also contains {{a certain amount of}} [...] "retained austenite." [...] Retained austenite are crystals which are unable to transform into martensite, even after quenching below the martensite finish (Mf) temperature. An increase in alloying agents or carbon content causes an increase in retained austenite. Austenite has much higher stacking-fault energy than martensite or pearlite, lowering the wear resistance and increasing the chances of galling, although some or most of the retained austenite can be transformed into martensite by cold and cryogenic treatments prior to tempering.|$|E

5000|$|Tempering is {{an ancient}} heat-treating technique. The oldest known example of <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite</b> is a pick axe which was found in Galilee, dating from around 1200 to 1100 BC. The process was used {{throughout}} the ancient world, from Asia to Europe and Africa. Many different methods and cooling baths for quenching have been attempted during ancient times, from quenching in urine, blood, or metals like mercury or lead, but the process of tempering has remained relatively unchanged over the ages. Tempering was often confused with quenching and, often, the term was used to describe both techniques. In 1889, Sir William Chandler Roberts-Austen wrote, [...] "There is still so much confusion between the words [...] "temper," [...] "tempering," [...] and [...] "hardening," [...] {{in the writings of}} even eminent authorities, that it is well to keep these old definitions carefully in mind. I shall employ the word tempering in the same sense as softening." ...|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the first}} uses of {{austempered}} steel was in rifle bolts during World War II. The high impact strength possible at high hardnesses, and the relatively small section size of the components made austempered steel ideal for this application. Over subsequent decades austempering revolutionized the spring industry followed by clips and clamps. These components, which are usually thin, formed parts, do not require expensive alloys and generally possess better elastic properties than their <b>tempered</b> <b>Martensite</b> counterparts. Eventually austempered steel made {{its way into the}} automotive industry where one of its first uses was in safety critical components. The majority of car seat brackets and seat belt components are made of austempered steel because of its high strength and ductility. [...] These properties allow it to absorb significantly more energy during a crash without the risk of brittle failure. Currently, austempered steel is also used in bearings, mower blades, transmission gear, wave plate, and turf aeration tines. [...] In {{the second half of the}} twentieth century the austempering process began to be applied commercially to cast irons. Austempered Ductile Iron (ADI) was first commercialized in the early 1970s and has since become a major industry.|$|E
5000|$|As {{austenite}} cools, {{the carbon}} diffuses {{out of the}} austenite and forms carbon rich iron-carbide (cementite) and leaves behind carbon poor ferrite. Depending on alloy composition, a layering of ferrite and cementite, called pearlite, may form. If the rate of cooling is very swift, the carbon does not have time enough to diffuse and the alloy may experience a large lattice distortion known as martensitic transformation in which it transforms into martensite, a Body Centered Tetragonal structure (BCT). This {{is a very important}} case, as the carbon does not have time to diffuse due to the high cooling rate, which results in carbon being trapped and as a result forms hard martensite. The rate of cooling determines the relative proportions of martensite, ferrite, and cementite, and therefore determines the mechanical properties of the resulting steel, such as hardness and tensile strength. A high a cooling rate of thick sections will cause a steep thermal gradient in the material. The outer layers of the heat treated part will cool faster and shrink more, causing it to be under tension and thermal staining. At high cooling rates, the material will transform from austenite to martensite which is much harder and will generate cracks at much lower strains. The volume change (martensite is less dense than austenite) [...] which can generate stresses as well. The difference in strain rates of the inner and outer portion of the part may cause cracks to develop in the outer portion, compelling the use of slower quenching rates to avoid this. By alloying the steel with tungsten, the carbon diffusion is slowed and the transformation to BCT allotrope occurs at lower temperatures, thereby avoiding the cracking. Such a material is said to have its hardenability increased. Tempering following quenching will transform some of the brittle martensite into <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite.</b> If a low-hardenability steel is quenched, a significant amount of austenite will be retained in the microstructure, leaving the steel with internal stresses that leave the product prone to sudden fracture.|$|E

The two most structurally demanding situations in building can arise under seismic activities and fire. This paper deals with the behavior of normal Fe 500 D (ASTM 1786) rebars under fire situations.

The results indicated that the 30 CrMo-M steel has stable chemical composition, its strength rises with increase of carbon equivalent, and thus it has better relativity. When concentration of quenching liquid is 5 %, yield ratio of the steel can be guaranteed to be low, thus safety of cylinder is improved.

40|$|Ferritic-martensitic (F/M) steels {{are known}} to have greater {{resistance}} to void swelling, higher thermal conductivities and lower thermal expansion coefficients than austenitic steels do. The strength and swelling resistance of F/M alloys can be further improved through adding fine dispersions of various yttria oxides. The majority of such oxide-dispersion-strengthened (ODS) alloys introduce dispersoids in ferrite phases. However, previous studies have shown that in the absence of dispersoids, the ferrite phase is significantly less swelling resistant than the <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite</b> phase. A dual-phase 12 Cr ODS alloy with improved corrosion and oxidation resistance exhibits promising microstructural stability and void swelling resistance under 3. 5 MeV Fe^ 2 + ion irradiation at elevated temperatures. Dispersoids were originally present in both ferrite and <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite</b> grains, with the latter having a wider range of dispersoid sizes.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} and thermal stability of austenite in multiphase advanced high strength steels {{are influenced by}} the surrounding microstructure. The mechanisms underlying and the relations between thermal and mechanical stability are still dubious due to the difficulty of isolating other factors influencing austenite stability. In this work, martensite/austenite microstructures were created with the only significant difference being the degree of <b>tempering</b> of the <b>martensite</b> matrix. Hence, the effect of <b>tempering</b> in <b>martensite</b> is isolated from other factors influencing the stability of austenite. The thermal stability during heating of retained austenite was evaluated by monitoring phase fractions as a function of controlled temperature employing both dilatometry and magnetometry measurements. The mechanical stability was studied by performing interrupted tensile tests and determining the remaining austenite fraction at different levels of strain. The thermal stability of this remaining austenite after interrupted tests was studied by subsequent reheating of strained specimens. The results are evidence {{for the first time that}} thermal recovery of martensite during reheating assists austenite decomposition through shrinkage and softening of martensite caused by a reduction of dislocation density and carbon content in solid solution. This softening of martensite also leads to a subsequent reduction of austenite mechanical stability.

40|$|In {{order to}} ensure a high {{passenger}} safety and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, dual-phase (DP) and martensitic steels (MS) are increasingly {{being used in the}} automotive industries. However, the main issue in the welding of steels containing a metastable martensite phase is softening, which occurs in the sub-critical heat affected zone (SCHAZ) and deteriorates joint integrity. This work attempts to understand the martensite tempering kinetics involved during high-speed laser beam welding where steels are exposed to the rapid heating and cooling cycles. Fiber laser welding was performed on DP steel and its dissimilar combination with high strength low alloy (HSLA) steel. Different zones that produced at heat affected zone (HAZ) were characterized with respect to microstructure, micro- and nano-hardness, and tensile testing. Microstructural characterization suggests that the as-received martensite phase decomposes in the SCHAZ and forms various shapes and sizes of carbides, which reduces the local microhardness of the steel and subsequently the sample fractured in this zone during tensile loading. In addition, the chemical composition and microstructure of DP steel {{plays an important role in}} the tempering reaction kinetics. The study conducted on the DP 780 steel composed of ferrite, martensite, and bainite microconstituents, exhibited increasing microhardness in the HAZ instead of softening. This phenomenon is referred to as “secondary hardening”. Rapid isothermal tempering conducted in a Gleeble simulator also indicated occurrence of secondary hardening at 500 °C, as confirmed by plotting the tempered microhardness against the Holloman-Jaffe parameter. The mechanism of secondary hardening in this kind of a steel was unveiled by advanced characterization techniques carried out using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging. The experimental results suggested that the cementite (Fe 3 C) and TiC phases located in the bainite phase of DP 780 steel decomposed upon rapid tempering to form needle-shaped Mo 2 C and plate-shaped M 4 C 3 carbides giving rise to secondary hardening. In order to investigate the influences of steel microstructure on the martensite tempering kinetics two commercially produced DP 980 grade steels were used. The study suggests that the severity of martensite tempering can be avoided by modifying the microstructure of the steels; the DP 980 steel produced with a combination of martensite, ferrite, and a blocky retained austenite phase promotes high tensile strength of the laser welded joint similar to the un-welded material. Strength of the <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite</b> significantly differed depending on the nature of the tempering mode and heat input. Therefore, <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite</b> obtained from four different tempering modes was investigated. Extensive recovery and reduction of boundary regions was identified on the structure tempered slowly, whereas rapidly tempered structures retained a high density of dislocations and less decomposition of the lath structure. The study revealed that dislocation density has a prominent effect on the macroscopic strength of the <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite</b> over all other strength contributors. In addition, rapid thermal cycles retained a high density of dislocations after tempering thus improving the <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite</b> strength. Therefore, the combined effect of dislocation density and the rapid thermal cycle was investigated by deforming the martensitic sheets to different levels of plastic deformation and subsequently tempering using conventional furnace tempering and the laser beam welding. It was found that the increased dislocation density due to the plastic deformation caused more nucleation sites for cementite precipitation, short-range carbon diffusion, and shorter growth period of cementite. The morphologies of the cementite were changed from elongated to small quasi-spherical when the sheet was plastically deformed. The deformed and <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite</b> yielded higher microhardness resulting from finer and semicoherent precipitates, a high density of retained dislocation density, and the presence of untempered and partially <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite</b> blocks. The thermal analysis of martensite tempering carried out using a dilatometer suggests that the carbide precipitation temperature range increases to the higher tempering temperature when the sheet was subjected to rapid thermal cycles. Finally, a microstructural based model was applied to predict the yield strength and microhardness of the <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite</b> by incorporating the effects of heating rate, tempering temperature, and time. Experimental and modelling results suggest that the faster tempering mode in combination with a very short tempering duration provides the highest <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite</b> strength...|$|E
