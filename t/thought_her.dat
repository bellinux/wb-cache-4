5|$|Out of sympathy, Gian Gastone befriended his unhappy sister-in-law, Duchess Violante Beatrice of Bavaria. Her husband, Grand Prince Ferdinando, <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> too {{ugly and}} too dull for him. At the same time, Gian Gastone sank {{into a state}} of melancholy. In an attempt to rouse him from this condition, Cardinal Francesco Maria often summoned Gian Gastone to festivities at his villa, Lappeggi. However, these soirées had no effect and Gian Gastone {{continued}} to weep unceasingly in his private rooms.|$|E
5|$|President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who had {{recently}} returned from a diplomatic visit to the United Nations, visited {{the site of the}} explosion on August 7. She was berated by local residents; some were angry because her surprise visit halted work at the site, and others <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> presence was politically motivated. The president stayed briefly, visited the CEMAR and met Bonfatti. Kirchner's entourage was surrounded by members of La Cámpora, who tried to prevent demonstrations against her and keep journalists and residents at bay.|$|E
5|$|In 1669, Anna Maria Luisa was {{considered}} as a potential bride to Louis, le Grand Dauphin, the heir-apparent of Louis XIV of France. Cosimo III {{did not like the}} idea of a French marriage, and never devoted himself fully to the cause (she was later rejected). Instead, Cosimo offered her to his first choice, Peter II of Portugal. Peter's ministers, fearing that Princess Anna Maria Luisa would dominate Peter II and fearing she might have inherited Marguerite Louise’s manner, declined. In fact, contemporaries <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> traits to be a combination of those of her father and paternal grandmother, Vittoria della Rovere.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, Stafford {{said there}} were good and bad points to working closely with Weston. His {{knowledge}} of her {{made it easy for}} him to arrange her music, but sometimes it caused difficulties. Weston knew Stafford's abilities and would write or arrange elaborate music because he knew she was capable of performing it. She also said she did not believe she could perform in Broadway musicals because she <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> voice was not powerful enough for stage work. In 2003, she recalled that there was often limited rehearsal time before she recorded a song, and how Weston would sometimes slip musical arrangements under the bathroom door as she was in the bath {{getting ready to go to}} the studio.|$|E
5|$|O'Hara {{played the}} love {{interest}} of Henry Fonda in the 1943 war picture Immortal Sergeant. O'Hara noted that Fonda was studying for his service entry exams {{at the time}} and had his head in books between takes, and that 20th Century Fox publicized one of the last love scenes between them in the film as Fonda's last screen kiss before entering the war. She next portrayed a European school teacher opposite George Sanders and Charles Laughton, in their last film together, in Jean Renoir's This Land Is Mine for RKO. At the end of a court case in the film, during a hearty speech by Laughton, O'Hara is shown teary-eyed on screen for a prolonged period. Malone <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> performance was effective, both crying and smiling, though considered Renoir to have overdone the film and confusing the audience as a result.|$|E
5|$|The {{premiere of}} The Bartered Bride {{took place at}} the Provisional Theatre on 30 May 1866. Smetana conducted; the stage designs were by Josef Macourek and Josef Jiři Kolár {{produced}} the opera. The role of Mařenka was sung by the theatre's principal soprano, Eleonora von Ehrenberg – who had refused to appear in The Brandenburgers because she <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> proffered role was beneath her. The parts of Krušina, Jeník and Kecal were all taken by leading members of the Brandenburgers cast. A celebrated actor, Jindřich Mošna, was engaged to play the Ringmaster, a role which involves little singing skill.|$|E

60|$|He {{thought of}} his poor child, Little Dorrit, {{for a long time}} there; he <b>thought</b> of <b>her</b> going home; he <b>thought</b> of <b>her</b> in the night; he <b>thought</b> of <b>her</b> when the day came round again. And the poor child Little Dorrit thought of him--too faithfully, ah, too faithfully!--in the shadow of the Marshalsea wall.|$|R

25|$|Charles dutifully {{wrote to}} Amanda's mother (who was also his godmother), Lady Brabourne, about his interest. Her answer was supportive, but advised {{him that she}} <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> {{daughter}} still rather young to be courted.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the people}} who interviewed her after her revelation of the visions <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> simple-minded. However, despite being rigorously interviewed by {{officials}} of both the Catholic Church and the French government, she stuck consistently to her story.|$|E
25|$|In 1965 Ford's {{daughter}} Lynette Storm {{continued in}} the religion after her mother and was photographed with Margaret Ruhe commenting {{that her mother was}} at the 1893 Exposition and that she <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> mother had run into the religion there.|$|E

60|$|An unexplainable {{instinct}} {{seemed to}} tell her that the papers were in that case. Her eyes were riveted on it, as if fascinated.

25|$|We {{would meet}} monthly, listen to up-and-coming concert artists and {{give money to}} deserving artists for further study. A very young Kathleen Battle sang for us. The other judges <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> voice was too small, but I thought she had an {{incredible}} ability to communicate through music. I talked the other judges into giving her a grant.|$|E
25|$|The film had its {{official}} world premiere on March 23, 1933 at Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. The 'big head bust' {{was placed in}} the theater's forecourt and a seventeen-act show preceded the film with The Dance of the Sacred Ape performed by a troupe of African American dancers the highpoint. Kong cast and crew attended and Wray <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> on-screen screams distracting and excessive. The film opened nationwide on April 10, 1933, and worldwide on Easter Day in London, England.|$|E
25|$|Madame Nhu's {{comments}} were such that President John F. Kennedy became personally concerned. He asked his advisers to find means of having Diệm gag her. McGeorge Bundy <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> {{comments were}} so damaging {{that it would}} only be acceptable for Ngô Đình Diệm to remain in power if she were out of the picture. The National Security Council deemed her a threat to U.S. security, and told the then United States Ambassador to South Vietnam, Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. to seek her permanent removal from South Vietnam.|$|E

25|$|The delayed première of Les vêpres Siciliennes, {{in which}} she sang Hélène, took place on 13 June 1855 at the Opéra, with Marc Bonnehée and Louis Guéymard. This was her last great triumph on the public stage. Performances {{continued}} through the year: Charles Santley, en route to Italy to commence his own studies with Lamperti or Nava, delayed in Paris for a day to hear Cruvelli in the Sicilian Vespers on 31 October 1855. On first hearing her, he had <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> a goddess: now he was somewhat disenchanted.|$|E
25|$|When White {{returned}} to the US in 1900, she <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> stay would be temporary, and she called for church re-organization at the pivotal 1901 General Conference Session. During her later years she wrote extensively for church publications and wrote her final books. During her final years she would travel less frequently as she concentrated upon writing her last works for the church. In 1915, White tripped while entering her study room and broke her hip. Her health subsequently began to decline, and she died on July 16, 1915. After three funeral services, she was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery with her husband.|$|E
25|$|In Harlan's model, {{having made}} the holy vow to burn herself {{transforms}} {{the woman to}} a sativrata, a transitional stage between {{the living and the}} dead, before ascending the funeral pyre. Once a woman committed herself to become sati, popular belief <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> to become endowed with many supernatural powers. Lourens P. Van Den Bosch enumerates some of them. The sati would gain the powers of prophecy and clairvoyance, as well as the ability to bless women with sons, who had not borne sons before. The gifts from a sati were venerated as valuable relics, and in her journey to the pyre, people would seek to touch her garments to benefit from her powers.|$|E

25|$|Possessing a high-spirited nature, Eleanor was {{not popular}} with the staid northerners; {{according}} to sources, Louis's mother Adelaide of Maurienne <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> flighty and a bad influence. She was not aided by memories of Constance of Arles, the Provençal wife of Robert II, tales of whose immodest dress and language were still told with horror. Eleanor's conduct was repeatedly criticized by church elders, particularly Bernard of Clairvaux and Abbot Suger, as indecorous. The king was {{madly in love with}} his beautiful and worldly bride, however, and granted her every whim, even though her behavior baffled and vexed him. Much money went into making the austere Cité Palace in Paris more comfortable for Eleanor's sake.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on these}} results, Bellugi and Klima {{believed}} that Genie had been developing {{as a typical}} right-handed person until the time her father began isolating her. They attributed the imbalance between Genie's hemispheres {{to the fact that}} Genie's sensory input as a child was almost exclusively visual and tactile, stimulating functions which are predominantly controlled in the right hemisphere of a right-handed person, and although this input had been extremely minimal it was sufficient to cause their lateralization to the right hemisphere. They therefore believed that because Genie had no linguistic input during her childhood, it underwent no specialization whatsoever and as a result her language functions never lateralized to it. Since Genie accurately distinguished speech sounds with her right hemisphere, they <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> language functions had lateralized there instead.|$|E
25|$|Sir Robert {{eventually}} convinced Jane {{to marry}} him, {{and with the}} assistance of Jane's advisers, notaries Robert Scurfield and Joseph John Wright, the marriage settlement stipulated that half of her income should be at her own disposal, but Sir Robert secured £1,000 a year for his own private use. The couple were married on 6 November 1815 at St Michael's Church, Houghton-le-Spring; she aged about 64 and he about 43. Peat had tried to introduce his wife to fashionable society in London, but on finding she had slipped away from the guests and was found talking to the servants in the kitchen, he <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> seemingly unfit for it and returned her to Sunderland. He lived apart from her at his vicarage in New Brentford and visited her just twice a year.|$|E
60|$|She hesitated {{and could}} not go on. It was a new experience, talking over such matters with her mother. And again her mother {{completed}} <b>her</b> <b>thought</b> for <b>her.</b>|$|R
