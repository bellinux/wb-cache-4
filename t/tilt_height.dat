40|$|BACKGROUND: With the {{increased}} availability of spatial data and computing power, spatial prediction approaches {{have become a}} standard tool for exposure assessment in environmental epidemiology. However, such models are largely dependent on accurate input data. Uncertainties in the input data can therefore have a large effect on model predictions, but are rarely quantified. METHODS: With Monte Carlo simulation we assessed the effect of input uncertainty on the prediction of radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) from mobile phone base stations at 252 receptor sites in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The impact on ranking and classification was determined by computing the Spearman correlations and weighted Cohen׳s Kappas (based on tertiles of the RF-EMF exposure distribution) between modelled values and RF-EMF measurements performed at the receptor sites. RESULTS: The uncertainty in modelled RF-EMF levels was large with a median coefficient of variation of 1. 5. Uncertainty in receptor site height, building damping and building height contributed most to model output uncertainty. For exposure ranking and classification, the heights of buildings and receptor sites {{were the most important}} sources of uncertainty, followed by building damping, antenna- and site location. Uncertainty in antenna power, <b>tilt,</b> <b>height</b> and direction had a smaller impact on model performance. CONCLUSIONS: We quantified the effect of input data uncertainty on the prediction accuracy of an RF-EMF environmental exposure model, thereby identifying the most important sources of uncertainty and estimating the total uncertainty stemming from potential errors in the input data. This approach can be used to optimize the model and better interpret model output...|$|E

40|$|Background: Distal radius morphometry (radial inclination, palmar <b>tilt,</b> radial <b>height,</b> and ulnar variance) is an {{important}} parameter in the evaluation and treatment of distal radius fractures in which anatomical alignment must be corrected. Currently, treatment of distal radius fractures in Indonesia is still based on morphometry of western population or from the contralateral side. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine distal radius morphometry of Indonesian population and to compare between right and left side, male and female gender. Methods: Distal radius morphometry was measured from 400 plain X-ray of right and left wrist AP and lateral projection. Samples were taken consecutively in Moh. Ridwan Meuraksa Army Hospital, Jakarta, from June to September 2010. Radial inclination, palmar <b>tilt,</b> radial <b>height,</b> and ulnar variance was measured. Data were recorded using tables and grouped between male and female, right and left side, statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney test. Results: From 400 plain X-ray evaluated, there were 300 males and 100 females with the mean age of 25. 5 years old (18 - 48). The mean of radial inclination was 23. 99 ± 3. 75 °, palmar tilt 13. 76 ± 4. 36 °, radial height 11. 31 ± 1. 66 mm, and ulnar variance - 0. 45 ± 2. 03 mm. There were statistically significant differences between right and left side of radial inclination, palmar <b>tilt,</b> radial <b>height,</b> and ulnar variance. There was also statistically significant difference between male and female. Conclusion: Distal radius morphometry in Indonesian population may provide valuable data for the treatment of distal radius fractures. The use of contralateral side as reference should be reconsidered.

Unstable modes have height, vorticity, vertical velocity, {{and several other}} atmospheric parameters with contours that <b>tilt</b> westward with <b>height,</b> though temperature contours <b>tilt</b> eastward with <b>height</b> for unstable modes. A poleward heat flux is observed in unstable modes, yielding the positive feedback necessary for cyclogenesis. Low pressure, high vorticity regions are then “stretched”, and high pressure and low vorticity regions are “squashed”, yielding higher and lower vorticity, respectively. In contrast, the opposite is observed in decaying modes: height, vorticity, etc. contours <b>tilt</b> eastward with <b>height,</b> except temperature which <b>tilts</b> westward with <b>height.</b> An equatorward heat flux is induced, decreasing potential vorticity and pressure anomalies and yielding cyclolysis.

This yields a growth rate that increases with increasing wavenumber for small wavenumbers, reaches a maximum growth rate at roughly , where κ is the wavenumber and [...] is the Rossby radius of deformation.

40|$|Theoretical and {{modeling}} studies of nongeostrophic effects in baroclinic waves predict that baroclinic waves should <b>tilt</b> poleward with <b>height,</b> {{with a larger}} tilt in total meridional wind than in geostrophic quantities. Regression analysis of NCEP–NCAR reanalysis 6 -hourly data demonstrates that observed baroclinic waves do indeed <b>tilt</b> poleward with <b>height,</b> although the observed tilt is smaller than predicted by previous studies. The meridional ageostrophic wind enhances the poleward tilt of meridional wind perturbations, despite being smaller in amplitude than the meridional geostrophic wind {{by a factor of}} 5.

Several important terms in this estimate have been left out of previous estimates of the meridional ageostrophic wind. Three terms in the improved estimate produce nearly all of the poleward tilt of the meridional wind: 1) the advection of geostrophic zonal wind perturbations by the mean zonal wind, 2) the convergence of the eddy momentum flux, and 3) the effect of friction.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2002 The midwinter {{suppression}} of the Pacific storm track is described in detail based on NCEP Reanalysis data from 1979 to 2001. The midwinter suppression is characterized by an equatorward shift and overall decrease in storm track intensity, {{measured in terms of}} eddy total energy (TE), that occurs primarily above 500 mb over the western and central Pacific. The suppression is accompanied by an equatorward shift and overall strengthening of the Pacific jet and a lowering of the tropopause poleward of the jet; it occurs despite the midwinter maximum in baroclinicity. An eddy energy budget analysis is performed to examine the changes in the flow of eddy energy in baroclinic waves during midwinter. Changes in baroclinic wave structure reduce the efficiency of baroclinic generation of eddy available potential energy (APE); decreased moisture and increased static stability reduce the efficiency of baroclinic conversion of eddy APE to eddy kinetic energy (KE); and shallower baroclinic conversion reduces the fraction of eddy KE that persists at upper levels. These effects overcome the increase in baroclinicity in midwinter to reduce the eddy TE at upper levels relative to fall and spring. Lag regression analysis reveals that, in midwinter, temperature perturbations are shallower because of increased upper level static stability and have a larger eastward <b>tilt</b> with <b>height</b> because of the stronger Pacific jet. Shallowing of the temperature perturbations decreases the fraction of eddy KE that persists, and the shallowing and larger tilt both decrease the efficiency of baroclinic generation. The lag regression analysis also shows that baroclinic waves <b>tilt</b> poleward with <b>height</b> in all seasons because of their ageostrophic wind structure. The combination of the effects of increased upper level static stability associated with the lowering of the tropopause causes most of the midwinter {{suppression of}} the Pacific storm track. Increased jet speed and decreased moisture make additional small contributions to the suppression. The poleward <b>tilt</b> with <b>height</b> of baroclinic waves places the maximum upper level eddy energy on the poleward side of the Pacific jet, where it is more efficiently suppressed by the lowering of the tropopause in midwinter...|$|R

DESIGN: Subjects age 40 - 70 {{years old with}} symptomatic and a radiographic K-L evidence of PFJOA. Weight bearing knee MRIs with and without a patellar brace were obtained using an upright open 0. 25 Tesla scanner (G-Scan, Easote Biomedica, Italy). Five aspects of patellar position were measured: mediolateral alignment by the bisect offset index, angulation by patellar <b>tilt,</b> patellar <b>height</b> by patellar height ratio (patellar length/patellar tendon length), lateral patellofemoral contact area and finally a measurement of patellofemoral bony separation of the lateral patellar facet and the adjacent surface on the femoral trochlea (Figure 1). RESULTS: Thirty participants were recruited (mean age 57 SD 27. 8; BMI 27. 8 SD 4. 2); 17 were females. Four patients had non-usable data. Main analysis used paired t tests comparing within subject patellar position with and without brace. For bisect offset index, patellar <b>tilt</b> and patellar <b>height</b> ratio {{there were no significant}} differences between the brace and no brace conditions. However, the brace increased lateral facet contact area (p =. 04) and decreased lateral patellofemoral separation (p =. 03).

It reveals some new crystalline phases and a cascade of transitions with rapidly changing flux (<b>tilt</b> in the <b>height</b> language). We analyze perturbatively the vicinity of the Rokhsar-Kivelson point, showing that this model has the microscopic ingredients needed for the "devil's staircase" scenario [E. Fradkin et al., Phys. Rev. B 69, 224415 (2004) ], and is therefore expected to produce fractal variations of the ground-state flux.
