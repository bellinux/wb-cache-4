40|$|Tools are {{traditionally}} de ned as {{objects that are}} used {{as an extension of}} the body and held directly in the hand or mouth. By these standards, a vulture breaking an egg by hitting it with a stone uses a tool, but a gull dropping an egg on a rock does not. This distinction between true and borderline (or proto-tool) cases has been criticized for its arbitrariness and anthropocentrism. We show here that relative size of the neostriatum and whole brain distinguish the true and borderline categories in birds using tools to obtain food or water. From two sources, the specialized literature on tools and an innovation data base gathered in the short note sections of 68 journals in 7 areas of the world, we collected 39 true (e. g. use of probes, hammers, sponges, scoops) and 86 borderline (e. g. bait shing, battering and dropping on anvils, holding with wedges and skewers) cases of tool use in 104 species from 15 parvorders. <b>True</b> <b>tool</b> users have a larger mean residual brain size (regressed against body weight) than do users of borderline tools, con rming the distinction in the literature. In multiple regressions, residual brain size and residual size of the neostriatum (one of the areas in the avian telencephalon thought to be equivalent to the mammalian neocortex) are the best predictors of <b>true</b> <b>tool</b> use reports per taxon. Innovation rate is the best predictor of borderline tool use distribution. Despite the strong concentration of <b>true</b> <b>tool</b> use cases in Corvida and Passerida, independent constrasts suggest that common ancestry is not responsible for the association between tool use and size of the neostriatum and whole brain. Our results demonstrate that birds are more frequent tool users than usually thought and that the complex 1) Corresponding authors’...|$|R

The “regional fact” is recognised by Notre law, which enlarge French regional competences and perimeters in view of a better position of French regions in the EU chess game. Currently, region/metropole dialog is the major vector of territorial dynamics, which reinforce a logic of inter-territoriality, imposing variable-geometry tools or scenes of governance, such as metropolitan poles or Scot. In the same way, economic actorsorganise along networks logic or cooperation or partnership, allowing a more flexible dialog with territorial governing bodies, in a similar way to competitive clusters and Communities of Universities and educative institutions (COMUE). But surface or perimeter approaches invite only a partial understanding of the French territorial dynamics and structuration. Indeed various types of cooperation between actors shape genuine urban systems at different scales. Thus, so called “proximity” systems are also connected — and impacted— by more “transversal” flux of cooperation between big metropoles, for instance. In France, each system is connected to the Parisian metropole, and regional systems also operate in interconnection. These types of governance invite a re-questioning of classical representations of territory; this is the current mission of urban planning agencies, as <b>true</b> <b>tools</b> of social engineering...|$|R

40|$|Taphonomic {{features}} of 156 graphoglyptids and other trace fossils preserved as hypichnia of thin-bedded turbidites in Oligo-Miocene flysch {{of the northern}} Apennines (central Italy) were analyzed. Two biogenic taphonomic categories—deformation and elongation—were produced in hemipelagic mud by the behavior of endobenthic organ-isms. Deformation includes such features typical of bulldozing and burrowing as twisting, squeezing, tilting, thickening, and widening. Elongation is considered a primary biogenic character controlled di-rectly by the tracemaker. Taphonomic features induced by such physical agents as currents and creep usually developed unidirec-tionally and include stretching, straightening, smoothing, bending, tapering, thickening, and thinning. These features, associated with hundreds of microgrooves (5 – 10 per 0. 01 m 2) interpreted as mud-current lineations, suggest that currents were active and produced deformational structures of fluting before, during, and after the bio-genic activity. Preservation of such delicate structures recognizable at different levels is particularly noticeable when {{a thin layer of}} fine material settled by suspension, molding all structures and producing a cemented film. Deformational structures may be particularly well preserved in thin-bedded (3 – 6 -cm-thick) and fine-grained calcarenitic turbidites as in diluted turbulent flow deposits that fringed the iso-lated Verghereto High. Activities of epi- and infaunal communities in this area are also exceptionally well preserved. Physical tapho-characters of graphoglyptids are interpreted in two ways: (1) as <b>true</b> <b>tool</b> marks produced in mud by a tractive water mass preceding sand deposition by turbidite flows, or (2) as structures inherited from pre-turbidite phases. Taphonomic analysis in deep-sea deposits, therefore, is a promising methodology to resolve the preservational state of trace fossils above and below the soles of turbidites...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe local {{organization}} of hunting, collective self-defense and {{regulation of the}} conflicts This article analyzes the organization of communal associations of hunting in four villages of South-west. The problems of the {{local organization}} of hunting are closely related {{on the evolution of}} the relationship between rural country and cities and the dynamics of the conflicts between the competing uses of the rural areas and “nature”. Communal associations seem <b>true</b> <b>tools</b> of self-defense of the community of the local hunters. They were created, since the Thirties, like means of protection against the pressure of the “foreign” hunters of urban and middle-class origin and resistance to the interference of the State. Moreover, they found a whole of rules which make it possible to control the potential conflicts rising from the relationship between owners, farmers and hunters and to sanction the “dissidence” of certain holders of hunting rights. Cet article analyse l'organisation et le fonctionnement des associations communales de chasse dans quatre villages du Sud-Ouest. Les problèmes de l'organisation locale de la chasse sont étroitement liés à l'évolution des rapports villes campagne et à la dynamique des conflits entre les usages concurrentiels de l'espace rural et de la « nature ». Les associations communales apparaissent comme de véritables dispositifs d'autodéfense de la communauté des chasseurs locaux. Elles se sont créées, depuis les années trente, comme des moyens de protection contre la pression des chasseurs « étrangers » d'origine urbaine et bourgeoise et de résistance à l'ingérence de l'Etat.

While this technique can speed up bug detection significantly, it introduces redundant execution traces which may complicate the ver-ification of the program. This holds particularly <b>true</b> for <b>tools</b> based on Bounded Model Checking, which incorporate simplistic heuristics to de-termine whether all feasible iterations of a loop have been considered. We present a technique that uses trace automata to eliminate redun-dant executions after performing loop acceleration. The method reduces the diameter of the program under analysis, which is in certain cases sufficient to allow a safety proof using Bounded Model Checking. Our transformation is precise—it does not introduce false positives, nor does it mask any errors. We have implemented the analysis as a source-to-source transformation, and present experimental results showing the ap-plicability of the technique. ...|$|R
