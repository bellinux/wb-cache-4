40|$|In recent years, the Republic of Korea (South Korea) {{has entered}} into many free trade {{agreements}} (FTAs) that contain special provisions—outward processing (OP) provisions—that extend {{the benefit of}} preferential tariff rates to the products manufactured or processed in the Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC). OP refers to the <b>temporary</b> <b>exportation</b> of goods for additional processing and the KIC is an outward processing zone in the People’s Democratic Republic of Korea (North Korea) where South Korean companies are allowed to establish manufacturing plants and to employ North Korean labor. As “temporary” indicates, the finished goods are always imported back to South Korea for domestic consumption or permanent exportation. Currently, South Korea does not impose any tariff on North Korean products because the South Korean government regards inter-Korean trade as “trade within a nation. ” Other countries, however, do not consider the two Koreas as one customs territory and treat products that have been processed in the KIC as North Korean goods. This treatment of products that have been processed in the KIC as originating in North Korea harms the exporters of goods processed in the KIC because North Korea is {{not a member of}} the World Trade Organization (WTO) and therefore products originating in North Korea are not entitled to most-favored nation (MFN) rates of duty. In order to solve this problem, South Korea has included OP provisions in its FTAs with other nations. These OP provisions explicitly stipulate that goods that undergo processing in the KIC originate in South Korea, and are thus afforded the preferential rates under the FTAs. This article addresses the main concern with regard to these OP provisions: whether South Korea’s FTA partners have violated the MFN principle by applying the OP provisions to products processed in the KIC, reducing tariffs on Kaesong products, while not offering similar benefits to the products undergoing OP in other countries. This article argues that a WTO member nation could file a successful complaint against South Korea’s FTA partners because the South Korean OP provisions are discriminatory, and thus in violation of the MFN principle. Additionally, neither South Korea nor one of its FTA partners has any successful defense, including a defense under WTO Article XXIV...|$|E

Therefore, since June 1990,Iran’s custom through cooperation with United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), United Nations Conference on Development Program (UNDP), and World Customs Organization (WCO), had tried to establish this system in Iran. In 1377 Hegira, by recognizing capabilities and attributes of ASYCUDA in equalizing and facilitating customs services, and increasing the efficacy of Iran’s customs, it is established in west Tehran customs and import section. ASYCUDA is a system for automatic processing of customs data which is a plan called NEGAR (acronym for automated system for customs data in Persian) in Iran. Then other parts like export, temporary admission, and <b>temporary</b> <b>exportation,</b> were performed in this customs as other sub plans of ASYCUDA. The aim {{of this research is}} to recognize obstacles in effective executing of ASYCUDA for increasing the speed of goods release, optimal exploitation of storehouses, better use of human force, developing usage culture for mechanized systems, gaining more income, and presenting in time, rapid, and exact statistics for foreign trades. This project is applicative by aim, but naturally, it is a surveying-descriptive project. We use some measures like frequency distribution, percentage, measures of central tendency, and measures of distribution, and statistical graphs in descriptive analysis. In inferential analysis, first by means of Kolmogrof Smirnov’s test, we examined the normality of data, and then by using T test we compare observed (practical) averages with theoretical one to decide about rejection or approval of each hypothesis individually. Finally, by using one-way analysis of variance, we compare the averages of four responding groups (Zanjan and Qazvin staffs, and clients of both of them) for every variable, and then with regard to research hypotheses, we compare these groups’ opinions. According to the obtained results, it is identified that in Zanjan and Qazvin customs the establishment of ASYCUDA has increased the speed of customs performance. All people have enjoyed from cost reduction in customs affair, and this enjoyment has been equal among all of them. Moreover, the establishment of ASYCUDA has increased the accuracy of releasing goods and as a result clients’ satisfaction has increased...|$|E
