5|$|On May21, 2007, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Oceanic</b> and Atmospheric Administration's Central Pacific Hurricane Center {{released}} its {{outlook for the}} 2007 Central Pacific hurricane season, predicting a total of 2–3 tropical cyclones to form or cross into the basin; in a typical season, 4–5 systems cross or form in the Central Pacific. A day later, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Oceanic</b> and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center {{released its}} seasonal prediction for the 2007 East Pacific hurricane season, predicting a total of 11–16 named storms, 6–9 hurricanes, and 2–4 major hurricanes. Below-average activity was expected {{as a result of}} either ENSO-Neutral or La Niña conditions, as well as the continuation of the reduction in activity beginning in 1995.|$|E

5|$|Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) {{is used by}} <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Oceanic</b> and Atmospheric Administration {{and other}} {{agencies}} to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones that are above tropical storm strength and entire tropical cyclone seasons. It is calculated by taking the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every active tropical storm (wind speed 35 knots or higher) at six-hour intervals. The numbers are usually divided by 10,000 {{to make them more}} manageable. The unit of ACE is 104 kn2, and for use as an index the unit is assumed. As well as being squared for ACE, wind speed can also be cubed, which {{is referred to as the}} Power Dissipation Index (PDI).|$|E
5|$|An {{off-season}} Atlantic hurricane is {{a recorded}} tropical or subtropical cyclone {{that existed in}} the Atlantic basin outside of the official Atlantic hurricane season. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Oceanic</b> and Atmospheric Administration currently defines the season as occurring between June 1 and November 30 each calendar year, which is when 97% of all Atlantic tropical cyclones occur. Peak activity is known to be between August and October. In the off-season, storms are most likely to occur in May, with approximately 60% of such storms occurring during that month. Occasionally, however, storms develop in or persist until December. As of , there have been 81 off-season cyclones in the Atlantic hurricane database, which began in 1851. In addition, there were six storms before 1851, and one hurricane in 1863 that {{is not part of the}} official database.|$|E

The facility has seen a large increase in smaller customers after 2004, when the Svalbard Undersea Cable System started providing a fiber Internet connection. Concessions for downloading are only issued to civilian satellites, yet some data has been indirectly used by armed forces.
