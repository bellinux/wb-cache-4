These included avionics upgrades, an expanded fuel tank, {{and the use of}} fibreglass composites. The changes were so extensive that a fourth prototype was built to <b>test</b> <b>them.</b> By 1983, Northrop was involved in a number of simultaneous negotiations for the F-20, and its prospects appeared positive.|$|E

A {{new version of}} the Network, called Rock Band Network 2.0, allows songs to be {{authored}} with harmonies, Basic and Pro Keys, and Pro Drums, but does not support Pro Guitar and Pro Bass charting due to the complexity of authoring those parts and the number of users able to <b>test</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|Acting Principal of Knob Haven High School Sue Sezno finds a case {{of pills}} in a student's locker. Believing them to be drugs, she hands them over to science teacher Miracle Grohe to study. Miracle, however, tells them the pills may be steroids; Sue decides to <b>test</b> <b>them</b> on her new {{assistant}} Principal, Stuart Proszakian. With the assistance of P.E. teacher Larry Littlejunk, she manages to successfully trick Stuart into taking the pills, telling him that they are vitamins.|$|E

5|$|Implicit in the {{decision}} to develop atomic bombs was the need to <b>test</b> <b>them.</b> Lacking open, thinly-populated areas, British officials considered locations overseas. The preferred site was the American Pacific Proving Grounds. A request to use it was sent to the American Joint Chiefs of Staff in the summer of 1950, but no reply was received until October 1950, when the Americans turned down the request. As a fallback, sites in Canada and Australia were considered. Penney spoke to Omond Solandt, the chairman of the Canadian Defence Research Board, and they arranged for a joint feasibility study.|$|E
5|$|Implicit in the {{decision}} to develop atomic bombs was the need to <b>test</b> <b>them.</b> The preferred site was the American Pacific Proving Grounds. As a fallback, sites in Canada and Australia were considered. The Admiralty suggested that the Monte Bello Islands might be suitable, so the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Clement Attlee, sent a request to the Prime Minister of Australia, Robert Menzies. The Australian government formally agreed to the islands being used as a nuclear test site in May 1951. In February 1952, Attlee's successor, Winston Churchill, announced in the House of Commons that the first British atomic bomb test would occur in Australia {{before the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot choreographed the {{original}} version of Giselle. Perrot and Carlotta Grisi were lovers and, consequently, Perrot designed all of her dances and pantomime. Everyone in the Paris dance world knew that Perrot had created Grisi's dances and Coralli admitted it, but Perrot was given no official credit in the printed materials such as posters and programs. This was most likely done to prevent Perrot from collecting royalties on the ballet. Perrot liked bold touches and planned several rapid aerial swoops on wires in Act II for Giselle. Grisi was afraid of these swoops, therefore a stage hand {{was brought in to}} <b>test</b> <b>them.</b> He crashed face-first into the scenery and the swoops were dropped.|$|E

5|$|The first buses {{operated}} by GO Transit, a suburban {{variant of the}} GM New Look bus, were unveiled at Queen's Park on August 11, 1970, about a month before commencing operations on its expanded services east, west and north of Toronto. Operated by Gray Coach, a pilot program to <b>test</b> <b>them</b> was conducted in Pickering before they entered service on 8 September 1970. Later buses included a combination of single-door, suburban-type transit buses built by Orion Bus Industries and New Flyer, and single-level highway coaches built by Prevost Car and Motor Coach Industries (MCI, now a subsidiary of New Flyer).|$|E
5|$|Chell and GLaDOS {{return to}} the modern {{chambers}} and face Wheatley, who is driven by GLaDOS's software to <b>test</b> <b>them</b> against a series of traps, which Chell escapes. In their final confrontation, Chell attaches three corrupted personality cores (Nolan North) to Wheatley, allowing a second core transfer to restore GLaDOS to control. However, Wheatley blows up the button needed to activate the transfer. With the facility exploding around them due to the impending meltdown of its reactor core, the roof collapses revealing the night sky, whereupon Chell places a portal on the moon overhead. The vacuum of space pulls her and Wheatley through the other portal still inside the chamber, and GLaDOS reasserts her control. GLaDOS retrieves Chell, who falls unconscious, and Wheatley is left in space with a corrupt personality core orbiting him.|$|E

As a fallback, sites in Canada and Australia were considered. In September 1950, the Admiralty suggested that the Monte Bello Islands in Australia might be suitable, so Attlee sent a request to the Prime Minister of Australia, Robert Menzies, for permission to send a survey party {{to have a look at}} the islands. Menzies agreed, and in November 1950, a three-man party headed by Air Vice Marshal E. D. Davis was sent out to the islands. The Australian government formally agreed to the islands being used in May 1951, and in December 1951 the new British government under Winston Churchill confirmed the choice of test site. On 26 February 1952 Churchill announced in the House of Commons that the first British atomic bomb test would occur in Australia before the end of the year.|$|E

25|$|Coupled {{with all}} this, {{materials}} such as celluloid have been recognised as highly flammable since early days of its usage, and acts such as the Celluloid and Cinematograph Films Act 1922 and the Cinematograph Act 1952 gave the fire brigade powers to take samples of film and <b>test</b> <b>them</b> for flammability {{even though they were}} not the enforcing authority.|$|E

A new version of Rock Band Network, called Rock Band Network 2.0, allowed songs to be authored with harmonies, Basic and Pro keys, and Pro drums, but did not support Pro Mode real guitar and bass charting due {{to the complexity of}} authoring those parts and a lack of qualified users able to <b>test</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|Briggs' {{love for}} {{baseball}} triggered {{another piece of}} research. During World War II the government had mandated that rubber in baseballs be replaced by cork. Complaints about the new balls lead Briggs to <b>test</b> <b>them,</b> and in 1945 he demonstrated that the new baseballs were inferior. This was done by addressing {{the issue of whether}} or not a pitched baseball could curve out of the plane of the pitch. With the help of two pitchers from the Washington Senators baseball club and his 1917 wind tunnel he studied the effect of spin and speed on the trajectory and established the relationship between the amount of spin and the curvature of the ball (see curveball). To measure the spin, he attached a lightweight tape to the ball and counted the number of twists in the tape. This was a popular topic in newspapers and is probably the most widely known of his research.|$|E
