500|$|The {{newsgroup}} {{was created}} by Gary D. Duzan during {{the third week of}} March 1990, four months after the first airing of a regular episode of the program, which was the episode [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"– a Christmas special that aired on December 17, 1989. The newsgroup was created before there was a world wide web, which emerged in 1993, so those earliest discussions were held on text-only platforms. According to Chris Turner, a Canadian journalist and writer of the book Planet Simpson, the newsgroup was among the most trafficked newsgroups of the early 1990s. In that period it became a popular community on the Internet. According to Brian Reid, a computer scientist who has been tracking newsgroup traffic since 1985, alt.tv.simpsons was the most popular television newsgroup in May 1994, ahead of a discussion newsgroups about general television newsgroup (rec.arts.tv), Monty Python (alt.fan.monty-python), the Late Show with David Letterman (alt.fan.letterman) and soap operas (rec.arts.tv.soaps). Since there is no official method for measuring newsgroup <b>traffic,</b> the <b>list</b> is considered unofficial.|$|R

We need to find an effective approach to detect and notify Botnet attacks. HTTP Botnet uses HTTP protocol. Using HTTP protocol and port 80, the attacks can be easily hidden and pass through the firewall and IDS system without detected. We use P 2 P network to share the results we have detected, and users can compare the packets of <b>traffic</b> with <b>list</b> of filtering mechanism. Using P 2 P mechanism to exchange information we have to detected, user who have been infected can find the connection of HTTP Botnet servers & Uninfected user can use this information as a comparison sample, when there are new packets. User can use it for determining whether the connections are malicious or not. By using the P 2 P technique, we can not only decrease the cost of implementation, but also let the network more resilient...|$|R
