5|$|Domain-general {{views of}} {{vocabulary}} development argue that {{children do not}} need principles or constraints in order to successfully develop word-world mappings. Instead, word learning can be accounted for through general learning mechanisms such as salience, association, and frequency. Children are thought to notice the objects, actions, or events that are most salient in context, and then to associate them with <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>that</b> are most frequently used in their presence. Additionally, research on word learning suggests that fast mapping, the rapid learning that children display after a single exposure to new information, is not specific to word learning. Children can also successfully fast map when exposed to a novel fact, remembering both words and facts after a time delay.|$|E
5|$|Joint {{attention}} {{is an important}} mechanism through which children learn to map words-to-world, and vice versa. Adults commonly make an attempt to establish joint attention with a child before they convey something to the child. Joint {{attention is}} often accompanied by physical co-presence, since children are often focused on what is in their immediate environment. As well, conversational co-presence is likely to occur; the caregiver and child typically talk together about whatever is taking place at their locus of joint attention. Social pragmatic perspectives often present children as covariation detectors, who simply associate <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>that</b> they hear with whatever they are attending to {{in the world at}} the same time. The co-variation detection model of joint attention seems problematic when we consider that many caregiver utterances do not refer to things that occupy the immediate attentional focus of infants. For instance, caregivers among the Kaluli, a group of indigenous peoples living in New Guinea, rarely provide labels {{in the context of their}} referents. While the covariation detection model emphasizes the caregiver's role in the meaning-making process, some theorists argue that infants also play an important role in their own word learning, actively avoiding mapping errors. When infants are in situations where their own attentional focus differs from that of a speaker, they seek out information about the speaker's focus, and then use that information to establish correct word-referent mappings. Joint attention can be created through infant agency, in an attempt to gather information about a speaker's intent.|$|E
5|$|Nouns {{can form}} noun phrases (NPs) {{where they are}} the {{syntactic}} head of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>that</b> depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers, conjunctions or adjectives. Noun phrases can be short, such as the man, composed only of a determiner and a noun. They can also include modifiers such as adjectives (e.g. red, tall, all) and specifiers such as determiners (e.g. the, that). But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as and, or prepositions such as with, e.g. the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles (this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers and modifiers). Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit. For example, the possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire noun phrase, as in The President of India's wife, where the enclitic follows India and not President.|$|E

5|$|Spanish {{control of}} Texas was {{followed}} by Mexican control of Texas, {{and it can be}} difficult to separate the Spanish and Mexican influences on the future state. The most obvious legacy is that of the language; the state's name comes from the Spanish rendering of an Indian word. Every major river in modern Texas, except the Red River, has a Spanish or Anglicized name, as do 42 of the state's 254 counties and numerous towns also bear Spanish names. Even many of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>that</b> have been incorporated into American English, such as barbecue, canyon, ranch, and plaza, come from Spanish words. An additional obvious legacy is that of Roman Catholicism. At the end of Spain's reign over Texas, virtually all inhabitants practiced the Catholic religion, and it is still practiced in Texas by a large number of people. The Spanish missions built in San Antonio to convert Indians to Catholicism have been restored and are a National Historic Landmark.|$|E

In particular, errors involving exchanges imply that one plans ahead in their sentence but only about significant ideas (e.g. <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>that</b> constitute the core meaning) and only to a certain extent of the sentence.|$|E

25|$|The Seri {{language}} is a head-final language. The verb typically occurs {{at the end of}} a clause (after the subject and direct object, in that order), and main clauses typically follow dependent clauses. The possessor precedes the possessum. The language does not have many true adjectives; adjective-like verbs follow the head noun in the same kind of construction and with the same kind of morphology as verbs in the language. <b>The</b> <b>words</b> <b>that</b> correspond to prepositions in languages like English are usually constrained to appear before the verb; in noun phrases they appear following their complement.|$|E

25|$|When {{children}} reach about 15–18 {{months of}} age, language acquisition flourishes. There is {{a surge in}} word production resulting from {{the growth of the}} cortex. Infants begin to learn <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>that</b> form a sentence and within the sentence, the word endings can be interpreted. Elissa Newport and colleagues (1999) found that humans learn first about the sounds of a language, and then move on to how to speak the language. This shows how infants learn the end of a word and know that a new word is being spoken. From this step, infants are then able to determine the structure of a language and word.|$|E
25|$|Kundera often {{explicitly}} identifies {{his characters}} as figments of his imagination, commenting in the first-person on {{the characters in}} entirely third-person stories. Kundera {{is more concerned with}} <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>that</b> shape or mold his characters than with their physical appearance. In his non-fiction work, The Art of the Novel, he says that the reader's imagination automatically completes the writer's vision. He, as the writer, thus wishes to focus on the essential, arguing that the physical is not critical to understanding a character. Indeed, for him the essential may not even include the interior world (the psychological world) of his characters. Still, at times, a specific feature or trait may become the character's idiosyncratic focus.|$|E
25|$|In {{significant}} respects, Jinsai {{can be seen}} as {{advancing the}} Neo-Confucian project that Zhu Xi, his chief philosophical adversary, had otherwise so effectively and persuasively championed. For example, Jinsai's most comprehensive philosophical text, the Gomō jigi (The Meanings of Philosophical Terms in the Analects and Mencius), was first recorded as Jinsai was giving a series of lectures on Chen Beixi's 陳北溪 (1156–1223) Xingli ziyi 性理字義 (The Meanings of Neo-Confucian Philosophical Terms). Much of the philosophical structure of Jinsai's Gomō jigi as well as its methodology of conceptual clarification and analysis clearly derive from Beixi's work. The two texts even share common elements in their titles, jigi and ziyi 字義 (Jpn: jigi) being written with the same characters, referring to the meanings of words. In both cases, however, <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>that</b> were discussed and defined were distinctively philosophical terms such as tendō (the way of heaven), tenmei (the decree of heaven), michi (the way), sei (human nature), kokoro (the mind and heart), kotowari (principle), kishin (ghosts and spirits), and many others.|$|E
