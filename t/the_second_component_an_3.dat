40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to analyze the correlative relations in the structure of terminological nounjuxtapositions. Its actuality is connected with the need of complex analysis of the structure and semantics of these specific lexical units, clarifying {{with a wide range of}} semantic relations between their components compared to the relations between the one-word terms. The purpose of the work is to find out the specifics of establishment of correlative relations between components terminological noun-juxtapositions (TNJ). The achievement of this goal involves the following tasks: 1) to determine the size of the concept JUXTAPOSITION; 2) to set types of TNJ by semantic criterion; 3) to describe the specific structure and lexical-semantic groups of TNJ with correlative components. The status of noun-juxtapositions as independent lexical and grammatical units is motivated by such criteria as: constant nomination, semantic integrity, idiomatic lexical meaning, integrity of design. It is determined that noun-juxtapositions with correlative relations are formed on the base of overlapping semantics of their components: mutual meaning specification (<b>the</b> first <b>component,</b> as <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>component</b> <b>a</b> first) or complementary of meanings (and the meaning of the first component and the meaning of <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>component)</b> ...|$|R

This is an {{open access}} article {{distributed}} under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. We propose a method for improving image quality in medical images by using a wavelet-based approach. The proposed method integrates two components: image denoising and image enhancement. In the first <b>component,</b> <b>a</b> modified undecimated discrete wavelet transform is used to eliminate the noise. In <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>component,</b> <b>a</b> wavelet coefficient mapping function is applied to enhance the contrast of denoised images obtained from the first component. This methodology can be used {{not only as a}} means for improving visual quality of medical images but also as a preprocessing module for computer-aided detection/diagnosis systems to improve the performance of screening and detecting regions of interest in images. To confirm its superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method is experimentally evaluated via 30 mammograms and 20 chest radiographs. It is demonstrated that the proposed method can further improve the image quality of mammograms and chest radiographs, as compared to two other methods in the literature. These results reveal the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. 1...|$|R

The difference between enthalpies of evaporation of components from solutions and those from the pure liquids, D(DH), depends on the chemical nature and concentrations, X, of solutions. The effect of concentrations on D(DH) makes different appearances in ideal and non-ideal solutions, although, as a whole, D(DH) increases {{with the growth of}} concentration of <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>component.</b> <b>A</b> model is introduced, which considers D(DH) as the sum of energetic changes of three sequential stages: passage of molecules from the bulk liquid into the surface layer, exit of the molecules on the outer side of the interface, and the following desorption into the gas phase. In the framework of the model, the main contribution to enthalpy of evaporation comes from the processes in the surface layer. It is suggested that adsorption from solutions, which changes the chemical composition of the surface layer with respect to that of the bulk solution, determines, to great extent, the difference in the forms of the curves D(DH) =f(X) for ideal and non-ideal solutions.
