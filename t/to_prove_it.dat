5|$|At {{the end of}} the film, Arroway is {{put into}} a {{position}} that she had traditionally viewed with skepticism and contempt: that of believing something with complete certainty, despite being unable <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>it</b> in the face of not only widespread incredulity and skepticism (which she admits that as a scientist she would normally share) but also evidence apparently to the contrary.|$|E
5|$|Some of Churchill's Native American critics, such as Vernon Bellecourt (White Earth Ojibwe) and Suzan Shown Harjo (Southern Cheyenne-Muscogee Creek), {{argue that}} his {{assertion}} of Native American ancestry without the ability <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>it</b> might constitute misrepresentation and grounds for termination.

5|$|A {{historical}} plaque {{awarded to}} Avery {{indicates that it}} is the oldest house in Ledyard and states its date from 1720, but evidence suggests it to be older. This plaque was part of a statewide funded campaign by the State of Connecticut for the 350th anniversary of the state's founding. Disagreements over the program were widespread due to the difficulty in dating the homes by craftsmanship and the lack of documentation <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>it.</b> Ledyard recognized the Avery Homestead because of the documentation possessed by Amos G. Avery.|$|E
5|$|Cantor {{extended}} {{his work on}} the absolute infinite by using it in a proof. Around 1895, he began to regard his well-ordering principle as a theorem and attempted <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>it.</b> In 1899, he sent Dedekind a proof of the equivalent aleph theorem: the cardinality of every infinite set is an aleph. First, he defined two types of multiplicities: consistent multiplicities (sets) and inconsistent multiplicities (absolutely infinite multiplicities). Next he assumed that the ordinals form a set, proved that this leads to a contradiction, and concluded that the ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. He used this inconsistent multiplicity to prove the aleph theorem. In 1932, Zermelo criticized the construction in Cantor's proof.|$|E
5|$|Cantor was {{the first}} to {{formulate}} what later {{came to be known as}} the continuum hypothesis or CH: there exists no set whose power is greater than that of the naturals and less than that of the reals (or equivalently, the cardinality of the reals is exactly aleph-one, rather than just at least aleph-one). Cantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and tried for many years <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>it,</b> in vain. His inability to prove the continuum hypothesis caused him considerable anxiety.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder {{encounters}} a delusional man, Gary Lambert (Brian Markinson), who believes his boss, Greg Pincus (John Apicella), may be a monster—and decides to take an entire office building, including Mulder, hostage <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>it.</b> Lambert is eventually killed, but somehow, Mulder inherits his ability to see Pincus as a monster. After Mulder claims that Pincus is a monster, he is locked in a psychiatric hospital, only to be saved by Scully: {{the only person who}} believes him.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{plan called}} for a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, at 121:28 mission elapsed time. On the {{original}} plan, {{this would have been}} at 7:44 UTC on September 4, 1983, before accounting for the last-minute launch delay; in the event, this was put back by one day to allow for further communications testing, and Challenger touched down at 07:40:33 UTC (00:40:33 PDT), September 5, 1983, on Runway 22 at Edwards AFB, {{on the morning of the}} seventh day of the mission. As with the launch, this was the first night landing of the program. The Shuttle orbiters had no on-board lights, due to the difficulty of designing landing lights to survive re-entry, and so the runway was lit by high-intensity xenon arc lamps to guide the orbiter in. There was no pressing operational requirement for a night landing, but there was a desire <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>it</b> was possible. Footage of the landing was shown in the 1986 film SpaceCamp.|$|E
5|$|Back in Scranton, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{are both}} trying to sell girl scout cookies for their daughters. When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell {{to in order to}} not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with absurd competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still can not make up his mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like a pony, citing they still want to maintain their dignity and will not go beyond the limit to what they would do for their daughters. When they walk away, Kevin says he will doing any absurd thing for them to continue, kissing Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>it,</b> but they still refuse.|$|E
25|$|The {{truth or}} falsity of his denunciations against Eybeschütz cannot be proved; Gershom Scholem wrote much on this subject, and his student Perlmutter devoted a book <b>to</b> <b>proving</b> <b>it.</b> According <b>to</b> {{historian}} David Sorkin, Eybeschütz {{was probably a}} Sabbatean, and Eybeschütz's son openly declared {{himself to be a}} Sabbatean after his father's death.|$|R

5|$|Lynch {{competed in}} road races and time trials, and {{off-road}} in cross country, in several world championships. She was not {{selected for the}} New Zealand road cycling team for the 1992 Olympics. She believed that omitting her was a mistake and intended <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>it</b> by doing well at that year's Tour de France Féminin. She placed sixth in that race and demonstrated her good form. In 1992, she entered the UCI Mountain Bike World Championships in the veteran category and won bronze in both the cross country and the downhill events. When it was announced in 1994 that mountain biking was to become an Olympic discipline, Lynch's focus turned to being picked for the New Zealand team. For that reason, she swapped from the veteran class to elite at the world championships. She became New Zealand's first representative in an Olympic mountain biking event at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. Aged 39, she was the oldest competitor in the event, but managed to achieve eighth place, leaving two previous world champions behind her. She retired from serious competition after the Olympics, {{with the exception of}} the first UCI World Cup in April 1997 that was held in New Zealand. Until her mid-40s, she competed at the top level in adventure racing. During her domestic career, Lynch won many national titles, and was a serial winner at premium events such as the Karapoti Classic and the Coast to Coast.|$|E
5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) trains a {{temporary}} worker Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) {{so that she}} can take her place when she goes on maternity leave. In the break room, the other workers discuss how attractive Cathy is and how excited they are to have her in the office. Pam, being well into her pregnancy, is sensitive about her looks and so becomes offended by their discussion. Most of them respond by assuring Pam that she is, if anything, more sexually attractive than before she was pregnant. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), however, argues that sexual attractiveness is a mostly objective quality and pregnant women cannot be sexually attractive, and accuses the others of lying to spare Pam's feelings. Troubled by Dwight's comments, Pam asks her husband Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) if he finds the new temp attractive. Not wanting to upset his wife, Jim tells her that he does not find her replacement attractive, even objectively. Though Jim gives no sign of unease, Pam is convinced that he is lying to her, and enlists the help of the harshly honest Dwight <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>it.</b> After a number of unsuccessful attempts to trick Jim into revealing he finds Pam's replacement attractive, Dwight and Pam convince Jim to submit to a lie detection test {{in the form of a}} retail store's blood pressure tester. At the conclusion of the interview, Dwight triumphantly announces that he recorded hypertension when Jim said he does not find the new temp attractive, but as Jim continues to insist he is telling the truth Dwight admits that he recorded equal hypertension on every question, including Jim's name. Pam realizes that Jim has unusually high blood pressure, which his father also suffers from, and forgets about the issue in order to focus on her husband's health.|$|E
5|$|The {{employees}} pursue Michael, and {{he confesses}} that {{he created the}} rumors to conceal the one true rumor. Andy fears {{that it might be}} the one about him. The employees urge Michael to tell them which one is true, but just as Michael is about to give in, Jim announces that Pam is actually pregnant to save Stanley. Michael denies it, but Pam shows her baby's ultrasound picture <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>it.</b> Later, while Michael discusses her pregnancy with Jim and Pam in his office, Stanley's wife Teri returns Michael's call from earlier. He picks up the phone with the intention of making an excuse for his earlier call so as to not tip her off, but he accidentally calls her Cynthia twice before Jim hangs up the phone for him. Teri had already been suspicious of Stanley and Cynthia, so Michael calling her Cynthia is enough for her to figure out what is going on. Michael, feeling guilty, watches from his office window as Stanley attacks Michael's car with a tire iron in a fit of rage. At the end of the episode, the three interns discuss what they have learned at Dunder Mifflin, which they essentially reveal was nothing.|$|E

25|$|A {{statue of}} Lieutenant Columbo {{and his dog}} was {{unveiled}} in 2014 on Miksa Falk Street in Budapest, Hungary.

25|$|Some {{mainstream}} Christian churches criticize creation science on theological grounds, asserting {{either that}} religious faith alone {{should be a}} sufficient basis for belief in the truth of creation, or that efforts to prove the Genesis account of creation on scientific grounds are inherently futile because reason is subordinate to faith and cannot thus be used <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
