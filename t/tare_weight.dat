5|$|A recent design, called Hy-Con, {{seeks to}} combine the {{strengths}} of single-hull and double-hull construction. Short for Hybrid Configuration, this design doubles the forward-most and rear-most holds and leaves the others single-hulled. This approach increases the ship's solidity at key points, while reducing the overall <b>tare</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bulker hulls {{are made}} of steel, usually mild steel. Some {{manufacturers}} have preferred high-tensile steel recently {{in order to reduce}} the <b>tare</b> <b>weight.</b> However, the use of high-tensile steel for longitudinal and transverse reinforcements can reduce the hull's rigidity and resistance to corrosion. Forged steel is used for some ship parts, such as the propeller shaft support. Transverse partitions {{are made of}} corrugated iron, reinforced at the bottom and at connections. The construction of bulker hulls using a concrete-steel sandwich has been investigated.|$|E
25|$|Gross {{weight is}} a term that is {{generally}} found in commerce or trade applications, and refers to the total weight of a product and its packaging. Conversely, net weight refers to {{the weight of the}} product alone, discounting the weight of its container or packaging; and <b>tare</b> <b>weight</b> is the weight of the packaging alone.|$|E

40|$|This effort {{describes}} how radio-frequency (RF) {{technology can be}} integrated into a uranium enrichment facility’s nuclear materials accounting and control program to enhance uranium hexafluoride (UF 6) cylinder tracking and thus provide benefits to both domestic and international safeguards. Approved industry-standard cylinders are used to handle and store UF 6 feed, product, tails, and samples at uranium enrichment plants. In the international arena, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) relies on time-consuming manual cylinder inventory and tracking techniques to verify operator declarations and to detect potential diversion of UF 6. Development of a reliable, automated, and tamper-resistant process for tracking and monitoring UF 6 cylinders would greatly {{reduce the risk of}} false or misreported cylinder <b>tare</b> <b>weights,</b> diversion of nuclear material, concealment of excess production, utilization of undeclared cylinders, and misrepresentation of the cylinders contents. This paper will describe a “proof-of concept ” system that was designed show the feasibility of using RF-based technologies to track individual UF 6 cylinders throughout their entire life cycle, and thus ensure both increased domestic accountability of materials and a more effective and efficient method for application of IAEA international safeguards at the site level. The proposed system incorporates RF-based identification devices, which provide a mechanism for a reliable, automated, and tamper-resistant tracking network. We explore how securely attached RF tags can be integrated with other safeguards technologies to better detect diversion of cylinders. The tracking system could also provide a foundation for integration of other types of safeguards that would further enhance detection of undeclared activities...|$|R
25|$|Every {{piece of}} {{railroad}} rolling stock operating in North American interchange service {{is required to}} carry a standardized set of reporting marks. The marks {{are made up of}} a two- to four-letter code identifying the owner of the equipment accompanied by an identification number and statistics on the equipment's capacity and <b>tare</b> (unloaded) <b>weight.</b> Marks whose codes end in X (such as TTGX) are used on equipment owned by entities that are not common carrier railroads themselves. Marks whose codes end in U are used on containers that are carried in intermodal transport, and marks whose codes end in Z are used on trailers that are carried in intermodal transport, per ISO standard 6346). Most freight cars carry automatic equipment identification RFID transponders.|$|R
25|$|In 1932, the Air Ministry issued Specification B.9/32 {{seeking a}} twin-engined day bomber with higher {{performance}} than any preceding bomber aircraft. Accordingly, Handley Page responded with their design {{to meet the}} requirements of B.9/32; this same specification also drew other submissions from rival aircraft manufacturer such as Vickers, who would proceed to develop the Wellington bomber to it. The design team, led by G.R. Vokert, drafted an extremely radical aircraft, initially centering upon the politically-favoured Rolls-Royce Goshawk engine; however, by mid-1934, development of the Goshawk looked less promising and thus the Air Ministry acted to relax the <b>tare</b> <b>weight</b> requirement of the specification, allowing for the use of heavier and more powerful radial engines such as the Bristol Perseus and Bristol Pegasus. According to aviation author Philip J.R. Moyes, the Handley Page design soon found support with the Air Ministry in part due to it was judged to represent a fair compromise between range, payload, and speed.|$|E
500|$|Calthrop {{had been}} engaged in {{negotiations}} with the Indian government for concessions to build a railway from Barsi Road to Barsi since 1887. In 1895 negotiations reached a satisfactory conclusion, and Calthrop formed a new company to build the Barsi Light Railway, and employed himself as consulting engineer. The railway became a showcase for his ideas. Five 0-8-4T locomotives, with even distribution of axle load, were constructed to Calthrop's specification by Kitson & Co. The goods rolling stock was constructed on common [...] pressed steel underframes, reducing <b>tare</b> <b>weight</b> and maximising potential wagon loads. Calthrop recognised the importance of railways in warfare, and designed the rolling stock to facilitate the movement of troops and equipment. Rolling stock rode on pressed-steel Fox bogies, using the Timmis system of double coiled springs. The line was constructed with rail inclination, then a new idea, which involves tilting the rail a few degrees to make its surface more nearly parallel {{with that of the}} tyre. Inclination is now applied universally to railways. The rolling stock could accept [...] radius curves.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new type}} of standard machine, based on a travelling (jockey) weight moving along a lever which is supported on strain-controlled elastic hinges. It is equally applicable to the quantities force and torque. In addition to step-by step loading, the machine can perform continuous calibrations without having to rely on a reference transducer. Furthermore, testing through the zero load condition is possible with suitable mounting components. In the case of force machines, the jockey-weight design allows to <b>tare</b> the <b>weight</b> of all load introduction components, so that loads as low as 0. 05 N can be applied without a reduction of accuracy. Design and operating principles of the standard machines are described, with particular emphasis on their application to modern calibration practices such as continuous calibration, together with some typical test results obtained so far...|$|R
50|$|The largest Schnabel car {{in public}} railroads operation, {{reporting}} number WECX 801, {{was completed in}} 2012 by Kasgro Railcar for Westinghouse Nuclear and is used in North America primarily to transport reactor containment vessels. It has 36 axles (18 for each half). Each half contains nine trucks which are connected by a complex system of span bolsters. Its <b>tare</b> (unloaded) <b>weight</b> is 399.6 ST and has a load limit of 1017.9 ST for a maximum gross weight of 1417.5 ST. WECX 801 {{has the ability to}} shift its load 44 in vertically and up to 40 in laterally {{on either side of the}} car's center line. When empty, this car measures 231 ft long; for comparison, a conventional boxcar currently operating on North American railroads has a single two-axle truck at each end of the car, measures 50 to 89 ft long and has a capacity of 70 to 105 ST. The train's speed is limited to 25 mi/h km/h when WECX 801 is empty, but only 15 mi/h km/h when loaded and requires a crew of six operators in addition to the train's crew.|$|R

50|$|<b>Tare</b> <b>weight</b> , {{sometimes}} called unladen weight, is {{the weight of}} an empty vehicle or container. By subtracting it from the gross weight (laden weight), {{the weight of the}} goods carried (the net weight) may be determined. This can be useful in computing the cost of the goods carried for purposes of taxation or for tolls related to barge, rail, road, or other traffic, especially where the toll will vary with the value of the goods carried (e.g., tolls on the Erie Canal). <b>Tare</b> <b>weight</b> is often published upon the sides of railway cars and transport vehicles to facilitate the computation of the load carried. <b>Tare</b> <b>weight</b> is also used in body composition assessment when doing underwater weighing.|$|E

5000|$|In {{spite of}} a {{traditional}} preference of the establishment to strictly adhere to the restrictive <b>tare</b> <b>weight</b> for the aircraft established in the tender, both Pierson and Wallis firmly believed that their design should adopt the most powerful engine available. Perhaps in response to pressure from Vickers, the Air Ministry overlooked, if not openly accepted, {{the removal of the}} <b>tare</b> <b>weight</b> restriction, as between the submission of the tender in 1933 and the flight of the first prototype in 1936, the <b>tare</b> <b>weight</b> eventually rose from 6,300lb to 11,508lb. The prescribed bomb load and range requirements were routinely revised upwards by the Air Ministry; by November 1935, figures within the Ministry were interested in the possibility of operating the aircraft at an all-up weight of 30,500lb, which aviation author C.F. Andrews stated to be [...] "a very high figure for a medium bomber of those days".|$|E
