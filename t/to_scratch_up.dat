He assigned confederates <b>to</b> <b>scratch</b> <b>up</b> cars, then blamed it on the union. [...] Similar activities have not been reported by others, yet Levitt said that creating and exploiting a prolonged climate of fear was key for him destroying the union's credibility.|$|E

50|$|The {{record is}} the last album before the band went on hiatus and bassist Marjolein Kooijman quit in 2014. Afterwords is {{somewhat}} {{a continuation of the}} previous album, Disclosure, containing remakes of five of the songs. De-constructed to just a few main elements, with a melody and perhaps a few lyrics retained, the songs start almost from <b>scratch</b> <b>to</b> build <b>up</b> completely different compositions.|$|R
50|$|Filming {{took place}} {{over a period of}} {{three and a half years}} in several {{different}} locations, with Merhige filling multiple roles in the film's production including working on the film's cinematography, and special effects. The film was shot using a 16mm Arriflex camera on black and white reversal film. While filming, Merhige would experiment with the film reel to give it an old, withered look. This included running the unshot negative through sandpaper in order <b>to</b> <b>scratch</b> it <b>up</b> before shooting. Still unsatisfied with the overall effect, Merhige decided to use an optical printer but was unable to find one within the film's budget. He then constructed one himself using old, spare parts that he acquired from camera stores and special effects houses. The film was shot in several different locations, the majority of which took place on a construction site on the border between New York City, and New Jersey for a period of 20 days.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new colour sensing system {{for measuring the}} colour of car paint accurately enough to reproduce the paint proportions <b>to</b> cover <b>up</b> <b>scratches</b> or wear on a car. The aim is to repaint a car’s damaged area {{at a fraction of}} the cost of repainting the whole car. The proposed colour sensing system is based on Light Emitting Diode (LED). A prototype for the system has been designed, built, and tested. During this work light was researched as well as lighting sources, how light travels, how light reflects and refracts, ways light can be quantized, the human eye, why cameras look accurate, lighting conditions and their effects, and the emergence of colour. ...|$|R

60|$|They set out at {{once for}} the brook, {{and in the}} {{twinkling}} of an eye the dragon had filled the whole twelve, carried them into the house, and brought them back to Stan. Stan was tired: he could scarcely lift the buckets when they were empty, and he shuddered {{to think of what}} would happen when they were full. But he only took an old knife {{out of his pocket and}} began <b>to</b> <b>scratch</b> <b>up</b> the earth near the brook.|$|E
50|$|Anti-union {{violence}} may be devious and subtle, as when union busting specialist Martin Jay Levitt assigned confederates <b>to</b> <b>scratch</b> <b>up</b> cars in {{the parking}} lot of a nursing home during an organizing drive, and then blamed it on the union as part of an anti-union campaign.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Query {{recommender}} systems give users hints {{on possible}} in-teresting queries {{relative to their}} information needs. Most query rec-ommenders are based on static knowledge models built {{on the basis of}} past user behaviors recorded in query logs. These models should be pe-riodically updated, or rebuilt from <b>scratch,</b> <b>to</b> keep <b>up</b> with the possible variations in the interests of users. We study query recommender algo-rithms that generate suggestions on the basis of models that are updated continuously, each time a new query is submitted. We extend two state-of-the-art query recommendation algorithms and evaluate the effects of continuous model updates on their effectiveness and efficiency. Tests con-ducted on an actual query log show that contrasting model aging by con-tinuously updating the recommendation model is a viable and effective solution. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} web-based {{framework}} to (1) {{set up a}} relational data base; (2) search and browse its contents interactively; and (3) edit/add content to it. Central to the framework is a database definition file: a text file that describes the database structure in a compact (JSON-based) format. This file can either be written from <b>scratch</b> <b>to</b> set <b>up</b> a new database, or be extracted from an existing database. Multiple versions of the definition file can provide different views (intranet/world wide web) of the same database. The platform provides an interactive search/browse wizard that (1) allows the user to compose complex queries without needing to know the database structure; and (2) presents the search results in tabular form, with interactive (AJAX-based) links to related child and parent tables...|$|R

50|$|Missouri {{had dropped}} their {{previous}} two games before hosting Nebraska, {{and came out}} with a vengeance, perhaps motivated by their failure to recapture the Nebraska-Missouri Bell after numerous attempts. The Cornhuskers had to fight <b>to</b> <b>scratch</b> <b>up</b> their 10-point halftime lead, and were unable to score again after the break. As the game waned, the Tigers put up seven points and eventually got the ball back again. Promptly moving up to Nebraska's 1-yard line, the first Missouri attempt to score was repelled by the Cornhuskers. On 2nd and goal, the Tigers lined up for another attempt but were denied the chance as time expired before the snap. Missouri's heartbreaking loss put them farther back in the series to 6-16-3.|$|E
50|$|Alex Ferguson was {{confirmed}} as Atkinson's successor within hours, recruited from Scottish side Aberdeen, {{where he had}} enjoyed considerable success in the previous seven years. United recovered well in the league after his appointment and finished 11th, managing <b>to</b> <b>scratch</b> <b>up</b> some impressive results including winning both of their league clashes with Liverpool (results which helped deprive Kenny Dalglish's side of the league title), a 4-1 home win over Newcastle United on New Year's Day 1987, a 2-0 home win over a resurgent Arsenal and a 2-0 win at Old Trafford in the Manchester derby which helped push City towards relegation. Their win at Liverpool also made them the only team to win at Liverpool in the league all season.|$|E

50|$|I {{remember}} clearly, itchingly, nervously, maddeningly {{the first}} time I laid eyes on it, pictured in a three-color, smeared illustration in a full-page back cover ad in Open Road For Boys, a publication {{which at the time}} had an iron grip on my aesthetic sensibilities, and the dime that I had <b>to</b> <b>scratch</b> <b>up</b> every month to stay with it. It was actually an early Playboy. It sold dreams, fantasies, incredible adventures, and a way of life. Its center foldouts consisted of gigantic Kodiak bears charging out of the page at the reader, to be gunned down in single hand-to-hand combat by the eleven-year-old Killers armed only with hunting knife and fantastic bravery. Its Christmas issue weighed over seven pounds, its pages crammed with the effluvia of the Good Life of male Juvenalia, until the senses reeled and Avariciousness, the growing desire to own Everything, was almost unbearable. Today there must be millions of ex-subscribers who still can't pass Abercrombie & Fitch without a faint, keening note of desire and the unrequited urge to glom on to all of it. Just to have it, to feel it.|$|E
5000|$|Prophet, {{tell them}} the truth about the story of Adam's two sons: each of them offered a sacrifice, and it was {{accepted}} from one and not the other. One said, 'I will kill you,' but the other said, 'God only accepts the sacrifice of those who are mindful of Him. If you raise your hand to kill me, I will not raise mine to kill you. I fear God, the Lord of all worlds, and I would rather you were burdened with my sins as well as yours and became an inhabitant of the Fire: such is the evildoers' reward.' But his soul prompted him to kill his brother: he killed him and became one of the losers. God sent a raven <b>to</b> <b>scratch</b> <b>up</b> the ground and show him how to cover his brother's corpse and he said, 'Woe is me! Could I not have been like this raven and covered up my brother's body?' He became remorseful. The QUR'AN (English translation by M.A.S. Abdel Haleem) The story of Cain and Abel has always been used as a deterrent from murder in Islamic tradition. Abdullah ibn Mas'ud reported that Muhammad said in a hadith:"No soul is wrongfully killed except that some of the burden falls upon the son of Adam, for {{he was the first to}} establish the practice of murder." ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this work, alumina-coated YTZP {{materials}} are proposed as means {{to combine the}} mechanical reliability of YTZP with the stiffness and hardness of alumina. Additionally, compressive stresses are developed in the alumina coating when cooling from the sintering temperature due to the thermal expansion mismatch between alumina and YTZP. The proposed processing method involves dipping of pre-sintered YTZP specimens in stable alumina suspensions and co-sintering of the dipped specimens. The influence of the processing parameters on the macro and microstructure of the materials has been established. Berkovich indentation has been performed to determine the Young's modulus of the substrates and coatings. The structural integrity of the coatings has been analysed using scratch tests. The Young's modulus. The optimised specimens present high resistance <b>to</b> <b>scratch</b> <b>up</b> to loads of 150 N...|$|E

6000|$|The mansion is 10x12, with a [...] "domestic" [...] roof. Yesterday it rained--the first shower {{for five}} months. [...] "Domestic," [...] {{it appears to}} me, is not water-proof.

The dog is not a good hunter, and he isn't worth shucks <b>to</b> watch--but he <b>scratches</b> <b>up</b> the dirt floor of the cabin, and catches flies, and makes himself {{generally}} useful in the way of washing dishes. Dan gets up first in the morning and makes a fire--and I get up last and sit by it, while he cooks breakfast. We have a cold lunch at noon, and I cook supper--very much against my will. However, one must have one good meal a day, and if I were to live on Dan's abominable cookery, I should lose my appetite, you know. Dan attended Dr. Chorpenning's funeral yesterday, and he felt as though he ought to wear a white shirt--and we had a jolly good time finding such an article. We turned over all our traps, and he found one at last--but I shall always think it was suffering from yellow fever. He also found an old black coat, greasy, and wrinkled to that degree that it appeared to have been quilted at some time or other. In this gorgeous costume he attended the funeral. And when he returned, his own dog drove him away from the cabin, not recognizing him. This is true.|$|R
