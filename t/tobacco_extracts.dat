40|$|Under {{pressure}} from social criticism and an unclear future, tobacco researchers {{have begun to}} seek alternative uses for the product. Here, we present our study on isolating tobacco compounds with fungicidal activity, {{which could be used}} as plant-derived pesticides. Using Valsa mali as the target fungus, agar plate tests were conducted to evaluate the fungicidal activity of various <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts,</b> including tobacco leaves extracts prepared with different solvents, extracts of different tobacco cultivars, and samples from different tobacco organs. Fungal growth morphology was used as the criterion to evaluate the fungicidal activity of <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts.</b> Correlation analyses between the fungicidal activities and the chemical components of <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts</b> indicated the major chemical constituents with fungicidal activity. Then, the active compounds were isolated and their effects on the ultra-microstructures of V. mali was analyzed using scanning- and transmission-electron microscopy. The results suggested that <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts</b> prepared with solvents of weaker polarity had higher fungicidal activity, and the inhibitory activity of <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts</b> against V. mali was also cultivar dependent. Furthermore, the fungicidal effects of tobacco flower extracts were higher than those of the leaf extracts. Chemical analysis indicated that cembranoids were the main fungicidal substances, which act by destroying the endometrial structure of the fungus. Tobacco cembranoids at 80 μg/mL could completely inhibit the growth of V. mali, with an EC 50 value of 13. 18 μg/mL. Our study therefore suggests that tobacco leaves and inflorescences are excellent plant resources for the biological control of V. mali...|$|E

Previous reports investigating the effects of nicotine and tobacco on platelet function are inconsistent. The present study investigated in vitro effects of nicotine, its major metabolites, <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts</b> and extract of tobacco-free snuff on human platelets. None of the metabolites cotinine, cotinine-N-oxide, nicotine- 1 ′-N-oxide or trans- 3 ′-hydroxycotinine (0. 1 – 10  μM) affected platelet aggregation or P-selectin expression. Nicotine (10  μM) weakly increased platelet aggregation, whereas trans- 3 ′-hydroxycotinine (0. 1  μM) and nicotine- 1 ′-N-oxide (1 – 10  μM) weakly inhibited adhesion to fibrinogen. To elucidate the influence of other tobacco compounds, we investigated the impact of moist tobacco and smoke extracts on platelet function. Filtered extracts of oral snuff, cigarette smoke and tobacco free snuff inhibited platelet adhesion concentration-dependently. The inhibitory effects of <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts</b> on platelet adhesion were independent of nicotine content and the nitric-oxide-pathway and not mediated through a platelet-nicotine-receptor. Taken together, <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts</b> inhibit platelet activation during short-term in vitro challenge. As only limited effects of nicotine and nicotine metabolites were seen, the tobacco-induced platelet inhibition are likely induced by other compounds present in tobacco and tobacco free snuff.

In plants, these proteins may function, for example, in cell wall synthesis and/or in synthesis of starch. We have isolated wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rice (Oryza sativa) Rgp cDNA clones to study the function of RGPs. Sequence comparisons showed the existence of two classes of RGP proteins, designated RGP 1 and RGP 2. Glucosylation activity of RGP 1 and RGP 2 from wheat and rice was studied. After separate expression of Rgp 1 and Rgp 2 in Escherichia coli or yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), only RGP 1 showed self-glucosylation. In Superose 12 fractions from wheat endosperm extract, a polypeptide with a molecular mass of about 40 kD is glucosylated by UDP-glucose. Transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants, overexpressing either wheat Rgp 1 or Rgp 2, were generated. Subsequent glucosylation assays revealed that in RGP 1 -containing <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts</b> {{as well as in}} RGP 2 -containing <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts</b> UDP-glucose is incorporated, indicating that an RGP 2 -containing complex is active.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} {{a new phase}} {{in the study of}} tobacco and its effect on the human body. Prior to this, interest was centered largely on the analysis of tobacco with a view to determining the importance of the toxins contained in it and produced by it in the process of smoking. Attention, however, became turned toward the possibility that most, if not all, of the harmful effects of the plant might be an allergic manifestation, due to sensitization of the individual. The skin test naturally was assumed to afford a representation of whatever sensitization was present. The consistently large percentage of patients with thromboangiitis obliterans showing positive skin tests to tobacco led to the conclusion 10 that in the pathogenesis of this disease an allergic state to tobacco might be a fundamental factor. In order, however, to substantiate such a condusion it is necessary to be assured that the skin reaction produced by tobacco extract is a specific response designating an allergic condition of the blood vessels. It was with this in mind that the following studies were undertaken. Reviewv of Literature The attempt to relate an allergic activity of tobacco to the natural history of certain of the less well-understood vascular diseases was begun by the work of Harkavy, Hebald, and Silbert 10 in 1932. Barker 11 had demonstrated that there was a greater consumption of tobacco in cases of thromboangiitis obliterans than in any other disease group, and upon this basis Harkavy and his coworkers built their theory that cases of thromboangiitis obliterans might show a, larger percentage of positive skin reactions to <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts</b> than would other individuals.

Despite numerous reports on the general toxic effects of oral smokeless tobacco very few studies have assessed the effect of smokeless tobacco on the viability and inflammatory response of gingival epithelial cells. Material and Methods In this study a reference smokeless tobacco (CORESTA CRP 2) was used to stimulate gingival epithelial cells. Once the gingival epithelial cells became confluent, the growth medium were conditioned with aqueous extract of CORESTA CRP 2 for 3 and 6 hours. Cell viability was measured by alamar blue assay, and cell culture supernatant was examined for the presence of human interlukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). Results Cells treated with smokeless tobacco reference product resulted in decreased viability compared to non stimulated group (P< 0. 05). In addition, the smokeless <b>tobacco</b> <b>extract</b> augmented the production of IL- 1 beta in a time -dependent manner (P< 0. 05).

Overall, high sugar tobaccos such as Oriental and Virginia {{had a higher}} moisture content at any given water activity compared to low sugar tobaccos such as Burley. Virginia and Burley were both predominantly colonised by Aspergillus and Penicillium spp. Of these, about 80 % of isolates could germinate at between 0. 75 and 0. 85 aw, equivalent to moisture contents of between 18 % and 24 % in Burley and between 22 % and 31 % in Virginia. Growth of the dominant Aspergillus and Penicillium spp. was much slower on Virginia and Burley <b>tobacco</b> <b>extract</b> than on malt extract agars over the range 0. 85 to 0. 98 aw. For some species the optimum aw for growth on <b>tobacco</b> <b>extract</b> medium was altered from that on the richer malt extract agar and for some {{there was also a}} significant difference in growth between Virginia and Burley extract agars. The mould-free storage periods for five different tobacco types was influenced by aw. Visible moulding occurred within 7 - 14 days at 0. 85 - 0. 90 aw but only after about six months at 0. 70 - 0. 75 aw. There were some differences in rate of moulding between tobacco types {{as well as in the}} range of fungi isolated at different aw storage levels...|$|R
5000|$|In {{their great}} first voyage to the New World, Christopher Columbus and his {{expedition}} {{were introduced to}} a plant whose smoke was called tobacco by the natives of Hispaniola.In 1560, Jean Nicot de Villemain brought tobacco seeds and leaves as a [...] "wonder drug" [...] to the French court. In 1586 the botanist Jaques Dalechamps gave the plant the name of Herba nicotiana, which was also adopted by Linné. It was considered a decorative plant at first, then a panacea, before it became a common snuff and tobacco plant. Tobacco arrived in Africa {{at the beginning of}} the 17th century. The leaf extract was a popular pest control method up to the beginning of the 20th century. In 1851, the Belgian chemist Jean Stas documented the use of <b>tobacco</b> <b>extract</b> as a murder poison. The Belgian count Hippolyte Visart de Bocarmé had poisoned his brother-in-law with <b>tobacco</b> leaf <b>extract</b> in order to acquire some urgently needed money.

40|$|Plant galls {{are widely}} distributed, and their {{extracts}} {{are used in}} traditional medicine worldwide. Traditional remedies containing extracts of plant galls in China, India and some African countries have effective {{in the treatment of}} various pathologies. To open a new promising procedure for screening bioactive compounds from plant galls, standardized plant materials were generated in vitro and used for phytochemical and biological investigations. Methanol aqueous chloroform and hexane extracts of Nicotiana tabacum leafy galls induced by Rhodococcus fascians were used to evaluate phenolic and flavonoid contents, and to investigate antioxidant activity by 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging and ferric reducing antioxidant/power assays and anti-inflammatory activity by the lipoxygenase inhibition assay. Infection by R. fascians modifies significantly the phytochemical profile of N. tabacum as well as its biological properties. The total polyphenolic content was increased (120 - 307 %), and that of flavonoids was reduced (20 - 42. 5 %). Consequently, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of non-infected <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts</b> are significantly modified compared to plants treated with leafy gall extracts. This shows that infection by R. fascians favoured the production of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds in N. tabacum. The study indicates the benefit of plant galls used in traditional medicines against various pathologies. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH. SCOPUS: ar. jFLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Plants {{have the}} ability to {{continuously}} respond to microbial signals in their environment. One of these stimuli is a steroid from fungal membranes, ergosterol, which does not occur in plants, but acts as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecule to trigger defence mechanisms. Here we investigated the effect of ergosterol on the secondary metabolites in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cells by profiling the induced sesquiterpenoids. Suspensions of tobacco cells were treated with different concentrations (0 – 1, 000 nM) of ergosterol and incubated for different time periods (0 – 24 h). Metabolites were extracted with a selective dispersive liquid-liquid micro-extraction method. Thin layer chromatography was used as a screening method for identification of sesquiterpenoids in <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts.</b> Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was used for quantitative and qualitative analyses. The results showed that ergosterol triggered differential changes in the metabolome of tobacco cells, leading to variation in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Metabolomic analysis through principal component analysis-scores plots revealed clusters of sample replicates for ergosterol treatments of 0, 50, 150, 300 and 1, 000 nM and time-dependent variation at 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h. Five bicyclic sesquiterpenoid phytoalexins, capsidiol, lubimin, rishitin, solavetivone and phytuberin, were identified as being ergosterol-induced, contributing to the altered metabolome...|$|E
40|$|The {{public health}} impact of pesticides, {{including}} insecticides, used in agriculture {{has recently been}} reviewed (WHO/UNEP, 1990). The overvew presented in sections 1. i and 1. 2. 1 of this monograph makes extensive reference to that document. 1. 1 Historical perspectives The use of inorganic chemicals to control insects possibly dates back to classical Greece and Rome. Homer mentioned the fumigant value of burning sulfur; Pliny the EIder advocated the insecticidal use of arsenic and referred {{to the use of}} soda and olive oil for treating legume seeds. The Chinese were employing moderate amounts of arsenICals as insecticides by the sixteenth century, and, not long afterwards, nicotine was used, in the form of <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts.</b> By the nineteenth century, both pyrethrum (a natural insecticide obtained by extraction of chrysanthemum flowers) and soap were being used for insect control, as was a combined wash of tobacco, sulfur and lime to combat insects and fungi. The {{middle of the nineteenth century}} marked the first systematic scientific studies into the use of chemicals for crop protection. Work on arsenic compounds led to the introduction in 1867 of Paris green, an impure copper arsenite, used in the USA to check the spread of th...|$|E

40|$|Corrosion {{and plants}} {{extracts}} inhibitive protection of mild steel specimens immersed in 0. 5 M hydrochloric acid was investigated {{at ambient temperature}} by gravimetric and metallographic methods. Extracts of kola plant and tobacco in different concentrations were used as ‘green’ inhibitors. This paper reports the results obtained from the weight loss method, calculated corrosion rates, inhibitor efficiencies and the metallographic observations from metallurgical microscopy. Addition of different concentrations of the plants extracts gave considerable reduction in the weight loss and in the corrosion rate of the test samples. This apparent corrosion inhibition {{was associated with the}} protective film provided on the steel’s surface by the complex chemical constituents of the plants extracts.
