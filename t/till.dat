40|$|Part 1 : Simulation, Optimization, Monitoring and Control TechnologyInternational audienceA virtual {{prototype}} of oblique rotary <b>tilling</b> based on SPH(Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics) was developed. Digital simulation and field test of oblique rotary <b>tilling</b> were conducted. The digital simulation suggested that soil mainly was torn to failure during oblique rotary <b>tilling.</b> Therefore, oblique rotary <b>tilling</b> could save energy. The given power consumption comparison of digital simulation and indoors test verified the virtual prototype. The optimization value of oblique angle and phase angle was given when rotary velocity equals 200 rpm and working velocity equals 0. 4 m/s based on simulation. By simulating throwing soil during rotary <b>tilling,</b> the result {{suggested that the}} velocity of soil thrown was not uniform but lean to tangent blade’s direction. This simulation result {{should be taken into}} consideration while designing oblique rotary tiller. Furrow bottom shape was figured out by simulating, too. The convex height was about 9. 6 % of <b>tilling</b> depth. All of the research result suggested that oblique rotary <b>tilling</b> might be a very potential <b>tilling</b> method which could save <b>tilling</b> energy greatly...|$|R

The teenagers saw her do this and left immediately. It was acknowledged that <b>Till</b> whistled while Bryant was going to her car. However, it is disputed whether <b>Till</b> whistled toward Bryant or toward a checkers game that was occurring just across the street.|$|E
5|$|In {{its lower}} reaches, the {{surficial}} geology {{in the vicinity}} of Shickshinny Creek consists of urban land highly disrupted by cut and fill, alluvium, alluvial terrace, fill, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift containing stratified sand and gravel, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Delta containing sand and gravel, Wisconsinan Bouldery <b>Till</b> (a glaicial or resedimented <b>till</b> containing boulders, and bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale. The bedrock mainly occurs on the mountains {{in this part of the}} watershed. In the middle reaches of the creek, the surficial geology mainly features bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale, alluvium, and a glacial or resedimented <b>till</b> known as Wisconsinan <b>Till.</b> Some Wisconsinan Outwash and alluvial terrace is also present near Koonsville. Some patches of Wisconsinan Bouldery <b>Till</b> and wetlands are also present. In its upper reaches, the creek is almost entirely dominated by Wisconsinan <b>Till,</b> bedrock, and some lakes. However, there is a patch of alluvial fan immediately north of Shickshinny Lake and some Wisconsinan Bouldery <b>Till</b> and Wisconsinan Outwash not far from the creek's source.|$|E
5|$|In the Sybertsville quadrangle, the {{surficial}} geology in {{the valley}} of Little Wapwallopen Creek mainly consists of alluvium, alluvial terrace, alluvial fan, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, and some small patches of Wisconsinan <b>Till.</b> The surficial geology on the valley slopes and uplands mainly consists of bedrock. In the quadrangle of Freeland, the surficial geology near Little Wapwallopen Creek mainly features Wisconsinan <b>Till,</b> Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, and alluvium. The surficial geology near the creek in the Wilkes-Barre West quadrangle mainly consists of Wisconsinan <b>Till,</b> with some scattered areas of bedrock and alluvium.|$|E

5|$|Layers {{deposited}} {{during the}} Pleistocene epoch, starting around two million years ago, cover most of eastern South Dakota. These are the youngest rock and sediment layers in the state, {{and are the}} product of several successive periods of glaciation which deposited a large amount of rocks and soil, known as <b>till,</b> over the area. The thickness of the glacial <b>till</b> layer ranges between 100 and 900 feet (30 and 270 m). This <b>till</b> is also what makes agriculture more prevalent in eastern South Dakota as it is extremely fertile.|$|E
5|$|Mose Wright {{stayed on}} his front porch for twenty minutes waiting for <b>Till</b> to return. He did {{not go back to}} bed. He and another man went into Money, got gasoline, and drove around trying to find <b>Till.</b> Unsuccessful, they {{returned}} home by 8:00am. After hearing from Wright that he would not call the police because he feared for his life, Curtis Jones placed a call to the Leflore County sheriff, and another to his mother in Chicago. Distraught, she called Emmett's mother Mamie <b>Till</b> Bradley. Wright and his wife Elizabeth drove to Sumner, where Elizabeth's brother contacted the sheriff.|$|E
5|$|That same year, PBS aired an {{installment}} of American Experience titled The Murder of Emmett <b>Till.</b> In 2005, CBS journalist Ed Bradley aired a 60 Minutes report investigating the <b>Till</b> murder, {{part of which}} showed him tracking down Carolyn Bryant {{at her home in}} Greenville, Mississippi.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tilling</b> and TBAT {{continued}} to trade successfully, but internal disagreements resulted in TBAT being {{wound up in}} 1942. The companies in TBAT were split between <b>Tilling</b> and BET, and the two groups {{continued to}} operate independently until nationalisation {{began in the late}} 1940s. <b>Tilling</b> Motor Services Ltd was formed from the break-up.|$|R
2500|$|On 18 September 1939, 17 {{days after}} World War II began in Europe, <b>Tills</b> was {{commissioned}} as an ensign in the Naval Reserve and assigned to Patrol Wing 2, Patrol Squadron 21. [...] On 14 April 1941, <b>Tills</b> was upgraded to regular Navy status and commissioned as an Ensign. [...] At this time, <b>Tills</b> was flying patrols with Patrol Wing 10 from USS Langley (CV-1) in the Philippines. [...] With {{the threat of}} war imminent, <b>Tills</b> was assigned to USS William B. Preston (AVD-7) stationed in Malalag Bay, Philippines. [...] William B. Preston served as a base for three PBY Catalinas tasked with patrolling the eastern parts of the Celebes Sea, one of which was flown by <b>Tills.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tilling</b> in {{absolute}} darkness (night tillage) might {{reduce the number}} of weeds that sprout following the <b>tilling</b> operation by half. Light is necessary to break the dormancy of some weed species' seed, so if fewer seeds are exposed to light during the <b>tilling</b> process, fewer will sprout. This may help reduce the amount of herbicides needed for weed control.|$|R

Holt also produced a short story, Diplomatic Incident, for the former <b>Tilling</b> Society in 1998 and another called Great Minds for the Friends of <b>Tilling</b> in 2006. The Friends of <b>Tilling</b> organise an annual gathering in Rye each September for devotees of Mapp & Lucia and E F Benson's other comic novels. Two other <b>Tilling</b> books, Major Benjy and Au Reservoir, were written by Guy Fraser-Sampson and published by Troubador. In 2014 the BBC made a new three-part series adapted by Steve Pemberton (who also played Georgie Pillson) from the original Mapp and Lucia novel.|$|R
5000|$|Richard <b>Tills</b> was an {{appointed}} Inspector of Public Works at Cairns in 1914—the {{appointment was}} popular because <b>Tills</b> {{was considered a}} practical man.

5|$|Emmett Louis <b>Till</b> (July 25, 1941– August 28, 1955) was a 14-year-old African-American who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955, after a {{white woman}} said she was {{offended}} by him in her family's grocery store. The brutality of his murder {{and the fact that}} his killers were acquitted drew attention to the long history of violent persecution of African Americans in the United States. <b>Till</b> posthumously became an icon of the Civil Rights Movement.|$|E

50|$|BET {{had entered}} into a similar {{agreement}} with LGOC in London, and was also expanding outside London. Instead of destructive rivalry, the two companies agreed to work in close co-operation. By 1928, a BET subsidiary, British Automobile Traction Company (BAT), had interests in nineteen bus companies, with <b>Tilling</b> being a co-owner of eleven of them, {{and at the same}} time was partly owned by <b>Tilling</b> itself. To simplify the arrangement, BAT was reconstructed with a new title, <b>Tilling</b> & British Automobile Traction Ltd (TBAT), and <b>Tilling</b> exchanged its shares in the various operating companies for an increased shareholding in the new company.|$|R
40|$|In the Midwest, about {{three-fourths of}} all {{soybeans}} and wheat are planted without prior tillage. But before corn is planted at least {{three-fourths of the}} fields are <b>tilled</b> {{in the fall and}} possibly <b>tilled</b> again in the spring. Farmers are <b>tilling</b> ahead of corn planting because they perceive a yield increase with tillage that is more than enough to cover the added direct costs for machinery, fuel, and labor. Typically, soybeans are no-tilled into corn stalks followed by soybean residue being <b>tilled</b> for corn planting the next year. No-tilling one year (for soybeans), then <b>tilling</b> the next (for corn), is not a true no-till system. In many situations, corn yields drop slightly after switching to no-till. In Ohio, 10 – 20 % of corn acres are no-tilled. So the question becomes, Why doe...|$|R
50|$|In 1931, a {{controlling}} {{interest in the}} National Omnibus was acquired by the <b>Tilling</b> Group. From then on Eastern National was run as a <b>Tilling</b> company, although the railways retained their shares until 1948.|$|R

40|$|Textural {{properties}} and microstructures {{are commonly used}} properties {{in the analysis of}} Pleistocene and older glacial deposits. However, contemporary glacial deposits are seldom studied, particularly in the context of post-depositional changes. This paper presents the results of a micromorphological study of recently deposited <b>tills</b> in the marginal zones of Hansbreen and Torellbreen, glaciers in southwestern Spitsbergen. The main objectives of this study were to compare modern <b>tills</b> deposited in subglacial and supraglacial conditions, as well as <b>tills</b> that were freshly released from ice with those laid down several decades ago. The investigated <b>tills</b> are primarily composed of large clasts of metamorphic rocks and represent coarse-grained, matrix-supported diamictons. The <b>tills</b> reveal several characteristic features for ductile (e. g. turbate structures) and brittle (e. g. lineations, microshears) deformations, which have been considered to be indicative of subglacial conditions. In supraglacial <b>tills,</b> the same structures are common as in the subglacial deposits, which points to the preservation of the primary features, though the sediment was transferred up to the glacier surface due to basal ice layer deformation and redeposited as slumps, or to formation of similar structures due to short-distance sediment re-deposition by mass flows. This study revealed that it might not be possible to distinguish subglacial and supraglacial <b>tills</b> on the basis of micromorphology if the latter are derived from a subglacial position. The only noted difference was the presence of iron oxide cementation zones and carbonate dissolution features in supraglacial <b>tills.</b> These features were found in <b>tills</b> that were deposited at least {{a few years ago and}} are interpreted to be induced by early post-depositional processes involving porewater/sediment interactions...|$|R
40|$|Zero tillage {{management}} of agricultural soils has potential for enhancing soil carbon (C) storage and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the mechanisms which control carbon (C) sequestration in soil {{in response to}} zero tillage are not well understood. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the links between zero tillage practices and the functioning of the soil microbial community with regards to C cycling, testing the hypothesis that zero tillage enhances biological functioning in soil with positive implications for C sequestration. Specifically, we determined microbial respiration rates, enzyme activities, carbon source utilization and the functional chemistry of the soil organic matter in temperate well drained soils that had been zero <b>tilled</b> for seven years against annually <b>tilled</b> soils. Zero <b>tilled</b> soils contained 9 % more soil C, 30 % higher microbial biomass C than <b>tilled</b> soil and an increased presence of aromatic functional groups indicating greater preservation of recalcitrant C. Greater CO 2 emission and higher respirational quotients were observed from <b>tilled</b> soils compared to zero <b>tilled</b> soils while microbial biomass was 30 % greater in zero <b>tilled</b> soils indicating a more efficient functioning of the microbial community under zero tillage practice. Furthermore, microbial enzyme activities of dehydrogenase, cellulase, xylanase, β-glucosidase, phenol oxidase and peroxidase were higher in zero <b>tilled</b> soils. Considering zero tillage enhanced both microbial functioning and C storage in soil, we suggest that it offers significant promise to improve soil health and support mitigation measures against climate change...|$|R
