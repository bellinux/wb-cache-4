5|$|After the shooting, Saldívar {{entered her}} red 1994 GMC pickup truck {{and tried to}} leave the motel parking lot. Motel {{employee}} Rosario Garza saw Saldívar leave her room with a wrapped towel. It was later <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Q-Productions to shoot Quintanilla, Jr. and others who were waiting for Selena. However, she was spotted by a responding police officer in a vehicle. The officer left his vehicle, drew his gun, and ordered Saldívar out of the truck. Saldívar did not comply; she backed up and parked adjacent to two cars. Her truck was then blocked in by the police vehicle. Saldívar picked up the pistol, pointed it at her right temple, and threatened to commit suicide. A SWAT team and the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit were brought in. Musicologist Himilce Novas later said the event was reminiscent of O.J. Simpson's planned suicide 10 months earlier.|$|E
25|$|Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry {{stated that}} he {{expected}} Clinton to face some tough questions, but <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{do a good job}} at (being Secretary of State). Christopher Hitchens of Vanity Fair called her nomination a ludicrous embarrassment on the edition of November 18, 2008 of Hardball due to the Clintons' overseas connections, her actions during the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary. Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) voted against a unanimous voice approval, citing ethical concerns. He sought not to block the nomination through a filibuster, but to voice his opposition to her policies. Senator David Vitter (R-Louisiana) also voted against Clinton in Committee citing her husband's foreign donations for his non-profit entities.|$|E
500|$|Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's jockey at the time, C. W. Cascio, said of {{her when}} he raced her at Del Rio, Texas, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have to go all out just {{to keep up with}} those big two-year-olds—what with her little enough to run under their bellies." [...] Her last race was at Enid, Oklahoma, and it was a match race against Bob K K, which she won.|$|E
60|$|At first I <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to ignore}} me entirely, but finally <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> better of it.|$|R
60|$|Eustace {{closed his}} eyes. After all, this girl had fought lions, tigers, pumas, cannibals, and {{alligators}} in her {{time with a}} good deal of success. There might be a sporting chance of victory for her when she moved a step up in the animal kingdom and tackled his mother. He was not unduly optimistic, for he <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> out of her class; but he felt faintly hopeful. He allowed himself to drift into pleasant meditation.|$|R
6000|$|... "She jumped up, and I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> away; but <b>she</b> did not go, {{and turned}} again toward me, and remarked, just as coolly as anybody could speak: 'Well, I do not wonder, either. Your Bernard {{is a most}} estimable man, and if nothing should happen in any way or at any time to {{interfere}} {{in the case of}} his surviving you I shall be happy to marry him. I think I would make him a very good wife.' ...|$|R
500|$|In an unaired {{pilot for}} 30 Rock, Rachel Dratch, a former SNL cast member, {{originally}} {{played the role}} of Jenna DeCarlo. In August 2006, executive producer Lorne Michaels announced that Dratch would be replaced as Jenna but would portray different roles in other episodes. [...] In the re-tooled pilot, Dratch appears as The Girlie Shows cat wrangler. Later in the month, NBC announced that Jane Krakowski had replaced Dratch in the role of Jenna, and that the character was renamed Jenna Maroney. Michaels said that [...] "everyone is thrilled that she is joining the cast", and <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a [...] "perfect fit".|$|E
2500|$|Benson's {{band had}} a high {{turnover}} of musicians, as they frequently left to marry G.I.s they met while touring. She once commented, [...] "I lost seven in one year to America. Only the other week a girl slipped away from the stage. I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the lavatory but she went off with a G.I. Nobody's seen her since." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bankhead was {{director}} Irving Rapper's first {{choice for the}} role of Amanda in the film version of Tennessee William's The Glass Menagerie. Laurette Taylor, who originated the role of Amanda, was an idol of Bankhead's and also an alcoholic, whose brilliant performance in the original Broadway production reversed years of career decline. Rapper called Bankhead's screen test the greatest performance he had ever seen: [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be difficult, but she was like a child, so sweet and lovely. I was absolutely floored by her performance. It's the greatest test I've ever made or seen in my life. I couldn't believe I was seeing such reality. Bankhead was absolutely natural, so moving, so touching without even trying. The crew was stunned, too." [...] But studio head Jack Warner rejected the idea because of his fear of Tallulah's drinking; though she promised not to drink during shooting, he refused to give her the part. The role was given to Gertrude Lawrence instead, whose acting was panned by most critics.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, at 23, {{she joined}} Newcastle's NBN Television, where she stayed {{for the next}} five years as a {{reporter}} and host to the evening local news broadcast. Originally <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> there as just a reporter, but the newsreader resigned and they offered the vacant position to her. She resigned from NBN Newcastle in late 1995 after being offered a job by Seven in Sydney. NBN took Bath to the Supreme Court to delay her appearance on Seven. The court granted an injunction against her appearing on Seven before 1 February 1996.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What an insufferable woman!' he began, {{when the}} lady had retired, talking very rapidly, only {{stopping}} {{to take an}} occasional breath. 'I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on all night. She's enough to drive the man mad. One couldn't {{get a word in}} edgeways. Why on earth doesn't this man come? Just like these people, they don't think that my time's valuable. I expect she drinks. Shocking, you know, these women, how they drink!' And still talking, {{he looked at his watch}} for the eighth time in ten minutes.|$|R
6000|$|... "She maun be weaned," [...] {{replied the}} warper, with {{a show of}} temper; he was {{convinced}} that the sooner Elspeth learned to do without Tommy the better it would be for herself in the end, but in his way of regarding the boy there was also a touch of jealousy, pathetic rather than forbidding. To him he left the task of breaking the news to Elspeth; and Tommy, terrified lest she should swoon under it, was almost offended when she remained calm. But, alas, the reason <b>was</b> that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> with him.|$|R
2500|$|During the episode, Ziva tells {{a witness}} {{that she and}} Tony shared a hotel room, and that she took the couch so she wouldn't have to hear Tony whine about his back. Tony in turn tells McGee that he took the couch. Ziva asks him why he lied and he returns the question. There was much {{speculation}} {{on the part of}} fans about whether the characters might have shared more than was divulged, but Weatherly said in response, [...] "The truth of what happened is probably something that can be discovered inside the episode itself. If you really listen to what they say, I think it is pretty clear what happened: Nothing." [...] He clarified that Tony and Ziva had [...] "a tremendous amount of fun" [...] in Paris and that, [...] "Ziva had more fun with Tony than she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have, which maybe shocked her a little bit, because she was so angry at him after he killed her boyfriend last year." [...] Cote de Pablo added, [...] "Michael has his views of what happened in Paris. I have mine. We haven't discussed it. But all I can say is it was good." [...] Shortly afterwards, Glenn Diaz from BuddyTV reported that the cast was divided on whether or not the characters should be allowed to progress beyond [...] "unfulfilled sexual tension".|$|E
2500|$|She {{rang the}} wall-crank phone two times before being shot {{twice in the}} face from the same window. One bullet entered her right cheek and exited behind her left ear. The other went in her lower jaw just below the lip, {{breaking}} it and splintering out several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She dropped to her knees but soon managed to get on her feet. She ran to get a pistol from the living room, but she was blinded by her own blood. She heard the killer tearing loose the rusted screen wire on the back porch. She <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be killed, so she stumbled toward her bedroom {{near the front of}} the house to leave a note. Meanwhile, the killer ran to the back of the house and made his way up the steps and into the side-screened porch through the back screen door. She heard the killer coming through the kitchen window, so she turned around and ran through the dining room, through the bedroom, down a hallway, through another bedroom, and then into the living room and out the front door, leaving behind a [...] "virtual river of blood" [...] and teeth throughout the house and across the street. Barefooted and still in her blood-soaked nightgown, she ran across the street to her sister and brother-in-law's house. Since no one was home, she ran 50yards more to A. V. Prater's house. Prater answered her call for help. She gasped, [...] "Virgil's dead", then collapsed. Prater shot a rifle in the air to summon another neighbor, Elmer Taylor. Prater called to Taylor to bring his car because Mr. and Mrs. Starks had been shot. Taylor, along with Mr. and Mrs. Prater and their baby, rode with Mrs. Starks to Michael Meagher Hospital (now Miller County Health Unit) at 503 Walnut Street. Mrs. Starks gave Mr. Taylor, the driver, one of her teeth with a gold filling. She was in a semi-conscious state, slumping forward on the front seat. Although she lost a considerable amount of blood, she showed no signs of going into shock and her heart rate remained normal. Miller County Sheriff W. E. Davis, who became head of the investigation, questioned Mrs. Starks in the operating room at Michael Meagher Hospital. The news was printed on the front page the next morning, on Saturday May 4, reading [...] "MURDER ROCKS CITY AGAIN; FARMER SLAIN, WIFE WOUNDED". Four days later, Sheriff Davis talked with Mrs. Starks again at the hospital. Mrs. Starks discounted a rumor that was circulating about Virgil hearing a car outside his home several nights in a row, fearing of being killed.|$|E

6000|$|... "She didn't say nothing. I didn't stop. I {{just said}} what he said I was to and then I beat it. I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> might <b>be</b> <b>going</b> to start weepin'." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> hesitated; I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> perhaps <b>going</b> to {{say that}} we had been very base. But she remarked after a moment, in a candid, {{wondering}} way, [...] "How much you must want them!" ...|$|R
60|$|They strolled away, {{among the}} lanes {{beginning}} to be indistinct in the twilight - she leaning on his arm - and <b>she</b> little <b>thought</b> how <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> down, down, down, Mrs. Sparsit's staircase.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Mr. Robinson, don't {{you talk}} like that. You wouldn't {{take it all}} calm that way if you <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, my lady?" [...] I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tell me her dreams, but no, {{when she}} spoke next it was only to ask a question.|$|E
6000|$|... “My gracious, that’s {{the worst}} {{experience}} I {{ever had in}} my life!” panted Leo, as soon as he could speak. “I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> chew me up!” ...|$|E

50|$|While Andrew Curtin was {{carrying}} Catherine E. Davidson, she gave Curtin her ring. Catherine E. Davidson {{gave him the}} ring because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to die and wanted to thank Andrew Curtin for carrying her to the ambulance.|$|R
6000|$|There {{was not a}} word of remonstrance, {{though the}} boy looked very disconsolate, and began to murmur the moment his father had gone. Albinia, who had {{regarded}} protection at a dentist's one of {{the offices of the}} head of a family, though dismayed at the task, told Gilbert that she would come with him in a moment. The girls exclaimed that no one thought of going with him, and fearing she had put an affront on his manliness, she asked what he would like, but could get no answer, only when Lucy scolded him for lingering, he said, 'I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> with me.' ...|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} Keith <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> faint. She had closed her eyes, and swayed {{so that he}} took a step, and {{put his hands on}} her arms.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{knows it}} now," [...] said Johnny; [...] "I went {{to say good-bye}} to her the other day, when I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be married. I could not help telling her then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The lady ducked {{her head}} under her mantilla, and {{drew in a}} long breath. I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> scream, but with all that intake of air she only came out with: 'Me likee Americanos.' ...|$|E
5000|$|According to {{the ancient}} tale, Zarqa’s tribe relied on her powers in {{detecting}} enemies and defending their land; as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> believed {{to have the ability}} to see riders from the distance of one week. In hopes to evade Zarqa’s gaze, enemies of her tribe decided to hide behind trees which they carried. Zarqa noticed what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on and alerted her tribe that the trees were moving towards them and that they hid soldiers behind them. To her dismay, members of her tribe <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> mad and choose to ignore her warning [...] The enemy troops eventually reached her tribe and killed every man in the camp, then they tore out Zarqa’s eyes and crucified her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well done, little 'un," [...] said Mr. Tulliver, laughing, while Tom felt rather {{disgusted with}} Maggie's knowingness, though beyond measure cheerful at the <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to stay with}} him. Her conceit would soon be overawed by the actual {{inspection}} of his books.|$|R
60|$|With {{something}} of an effort, she banished her disturbing <b>thoughts.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to marry Jim. Perhaps she could mold him a little. Yet she did not know; {{she did not want}} to conventionalize him; there was something rather fine about his ruggedness. Then she began to wonder why she had asked him to tell nobody yet. Girls she knew had found an obvious satisfaction in exhibiting their lovers, but she had felt a need for concealment. This <b>was</b> not because <b>she</b> feared her mother's disapproval; it looked as if she had unconsciously tried to leave open a way of escape. By and by a car rolled up the drive and Mordaunt came in.|$|R
6000|$|... "Maxwell? I {{thought the}} change might do him good; yes," [...] said Matt, with a cowardly joy in his {{escape from the}} worst he feared. He <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> speak to him of Suzette.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> smile. We were both {{thinking}} of Edwin. But {{it was only}} for a moment, and then her face grew cold once more, and the chin resumed its angle of determination.|$|E
6000|$|One {{time the}} {{trembling}} of this poor lip {{was so strong}} and her tears ran down so fast that I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tell me all her woe, so I takes her two hands in mine and I says: ...|$|E
60|$|The crude {{realism of}} the picture, {{possibly}} harmless enough in its effect upon others, overpowered and sickened her. By a curious fascination {{she would look}} at it again and again, till every line of the engraver's performance seemed really a transcript from what had happened before his eyes. With such details fresh in her <b>thoughts</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{out of the door}} to make arrangements for confirming, by repetition, her marriage with another. No interval was available for serious reflection on the tragedy, or for allowing the softening effects of time to operate in her mind.

60|$|At last {{with the}} morning sleep came; but the sleep was almost {{worse than the}} wakefulness, for it was {{accompanied}} by ugly, disturbing dreams. Liza <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> through the fight with her enemy, and Mrs. Blakeston grew enormous in size, and multiplied, so that every way she turned the figure confronted her. And she began running away, and she ran and ran till she found herself reckoning up an account she had puzzled over in the morning, and she did it backwards and forwards, upwards and downwards, starting here, starting there, and the figures got mixed up with other things, {{and she had to}} begin over again, and everything jumbled up, and her head whirled, till finally, with a start, she woke.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Squire {{told me so}} himself," [...] he went on, {{keeping his}} eyes remorselessly fixed upon her face. She leaned forward and he <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to faint, but she did not. By a supreme effort she {{recovered}} herself and drank a glass of sherry which was standing by her side.|$|R
