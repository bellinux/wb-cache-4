5|$|Independence {{talks between}} Britain and Rhodesia {{continued}} for a fortnight without major {{reference to the}} Reedman appointment, with Britain more concerned with discussing a possible Rhodesian unilateral declaration of independence (UDI). Smith delivered an openly defiant speech to his parliament on 30 June, attacking Britain for its handling of the Commonwealth's newer members, which he said were unduly influencing British policy in Africa. Britain was desperate to avoid the international humiliation that would accompany the organisation's break-up, he claimed, and was therefore attempting to hold it together by appeasing the less prominent members. While making clear his disdain, the Prime Minister pledged <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> negotiations, saying {{that he did not}} believe Britain truly endorsed its professed line.|$|E

25|$|This {{arises in}} the {{following}} way. We never need four colors in a neighborhood unless there be four counties, {{each of which has}} boundary lines in common with each of the other three. Such a thing cannot happen with four areas unless one or more of them be inclosed by the rest; and the color used for the inclosed county is thus set free <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with.</b> Now this principle, that four areas cannot each have common boundary with all the other three without inclosure, is not, we fully believe, capable of demonstration upon anything more evident and more elementary; it must stand as a postulate.|$|E
25|$|In August the 29th Indian Brigade was {{secretly}} moved from Helles to ANZAC Cove, but {{were greeted by}} shellfire on landing on 5 August, {{and part of the}} 14th Sikhs had to wait until the next night to land. They then took part in the Battle of Sari Bair on 7 August alongside Australian troops, all under Cox's command. Palin commanded one of the four attacking columns, but like Cox and the other commanders was provided with no staff and the objectives set for them were beyond attainment. 14th Sikhs got onto Rhododendron Spur and made contact with 4th Australian Brigade on their flank. The Australians were ordered <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> the Sikhs and assault Hill 305 (Koja Chemen Tepe), but it was found to be impossible. In the subsequent attempt to capture Hill 60, the artillery preparation was again inadequate, casualties were very heavy, and the objective remained untaken.|$|E
25|$|In some competitions, {{the game}} cannot {{end in a}} draw, so away goals, extra time and kicks from the penalty mark are the three methods for {{determining}} the winner after a match has been drawn. Away goals mean that if the team's score is level after playing one home and one away game, the goals scored in the away match count as double. Extra time consists of two periods of five minutes. If no winner is produced after these methods, 3 kicks from the penalty mark are taken, and the team that has scored the most wins. If it is not decided after 3 kicks from the penalty mark, it continues <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> one extra kick from the penalty mark to each team {{at a time until}} one of them has scored more goals than the other. Unlike extra time, the goals scored in a shoot-out do not count towards the goals scored throughout the match.|$|E

25|$|The related {{concept of}} {{maternal}} mind-mindedness assesses the mother's {{ability to understand}} and verbalize the infant's mind: thoughts, desires, intentions and memories. Maternal mind-mindedness {{has been found to}} be related to some developmental results, such as attachment security. A caregiver's comment is deemed an appropriate mind-related comment if the comment was deemed to match the infant's behaviour by the independent coder, if the comment associated the infant's current activity to past activities, and/or if the comment encouraged the infant <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> his or her intentions when the conversation paused. This correlates to high maternal mind-mindedness. If the caregiver assigns the wrong internal state to the baby's behaviour, if the comment about the current activity is not insufficiently associated with a past event, if the comment deters the infant from proceeding with the current activity, and/or if the comment is unclear, it is deemed a in-appropriate mind-related comment and correlates to low mind-mindedness.|$|E
25|$|Hughes {{dismissal}} in {{the morning}} session left Australia 331 for 7, and England should have knocked {{over the last few}} wickets, but their inability to clean up the Australian tail cost them dearly. First Trevor Hohns with 21 off 38 balls, and then fast bowler Geoff Lawson with a career best of 74 off 94 balls provided the lower tail support Steve Waugh needed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> his innings. As the impetus of Waugh's innings grew, Lawson contented himself with spectating from the bowler's end, and playing defensively when he had to, although the 11 fours he struck during his innings testified to his ability to pick off the bad balls that were bowled to him. Lawson eventually fell to Emburey's off-spin for 74, but the damage had been done as he had supported Waugh to guide the Australian's past 500. With the fall of Terry Alderman's wicket, Australia ware all out for 528, a first innings lead of 242, with Steve Waugh once again not out on 152.|$|E
25|$|On the {{run down}} to the first chicane Alesi slowed with an {{electrical}} problem and retired in the pits, but also blocked Katayama, allowing both Schumacher and Hill to attack. Schumacher went through but Hill hit Katayama, damaging his front wing. Coulthard had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> a damaged car for an extra lap while the team put a new wing on Hill's car and sent him away. Brundle and Coulthard also rejoined after repairs as Berger was leading from Schumacher, Katayama, Olivier Panis, Bernard and Fittipaldi. Katayama retired on lap 7 with throttle troubles as Verstappen passed Fittipaldi. It {{was time for the}} stops and Verstappen retired with a spectacular fire as fuel spilled onto the bodywork of the car. He managed to escape relatively uninjured but the car was reduced to a smoldering wreck. The incident served to highlight the dangers of refuelling now it had been re-introduced to the sport, and paved the way for future safety measures. Schumacher retired on lap 20 with an engine failure.|$|E

25|$|Isaac Anderson, The New York Times Book Review (January 7, 1940) — There {{is more of}} Archie Goodwin than of Nero Wolfe in this book, {{and that}} is all to the good, for, {{although}} Wolfe is Archie's boss and the one who does the heavy thinking, Archie is, unless our guess is wide of the mark, the person whom readers of the Nero Wolfe stories take to their hearts. If Nero is the brains of the concern, Archie is its arms and hands and legs. When Nero wants something done, he does not need to tell Archie how to do it. Archie will figure that out for himself, and the thing is as good as done, however difficult the assignment may be. In the murder case with which this story deals there are international complications which make things unusually difficult. The police and the G-men are in it too, but the best that they can do is to watch Nero Wolfe and wait for him to come through with the solution. The book is full of surprises for everybody concerned, including not only the reader but also the police, Archie and even Nero Wolfe himself. Read one chapter of this book and you will need no urging <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> it.|$|E
25|$|UFC owner Bob Meyrowitz, referee John McCarthy {{and a team}} {{of lawyers}} were in court until 4:30p.m. {{on the day of the}} fight battling with the District Attorney of Michigan, who was trying to prevent the UFC from holding the event in the state. An {{ultimatum}} was issued: the fight could go on as long as there were no closed fisted strikes to the head and no headbutts. The UFC, desperate to put the show on, agreed to the terms. Fighters were warned hours before the show that they would be arrested if they punched to the head with a closed fist. When Shamrock learned of the sudden rule change, he made up his mind that he was not going to fight. While training for the match, Shamrock suffered a torn lateral meniscus, a partially torn ACL, a broken nose, and cracked ribs. His injuries combined with the rule change, he did not think he could win the fight because all of his weapons were taken away from him. Shamrock was also fearful that he would be arrested; the troubled boys from his father's foster home would be watching him and he was afraid of setting a bad example. If Shamrock withdrew, the main event would have been cancelled and the UFC could have suffered substantial monetary damage. After UFC owner Bob Meyrowitz and other UFC officials pleaded with Shamrock <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> the show, Shamrock, despite the injuries and new rules, reluctantly gave in to the pressure.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, the LRR {{conducted}} a trojan horse operation at a drag race to either kill or capture Abu Sayyaf target Sihata Latip, who was wanted for kidnapping 21 people in Malaysia in 2000. He {{went on to}} conduct a string of kidnappings in the Philippines over subsequent years, but as the Philippines got better at counter terrorism operation, the Islamists were cut off from overseas international terrorist finance networks, particularly the ones originating in Saudi Arabia {{and in order to}} make up for this loss in income, they engage in kidnapping for ransom. The 24 LRR soldeirs trained for a week to execute the mission. They dressed up as if going to a Muslim wedding, rented local jeeps and decorated it. Some soldiers dressed up as women to avoid raising suspicion. One soldier with a M249 light machine gun dressed as a pregnant woman, but forgot to shave {{on the day of the}} operation and had to loan a hand fan from one of the female soldiers on the base to cover his goatee. On the way to the drag race one of the jeeps broke down. The commander of the operation decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> the mission with only one jeep and 13 men. When they arrived at the drag race, the LRR operators identified their High Value Target from about 50 civilians and terrorists, approached and drew weapons. A firefight ensued in which the target was killed, but at the loss of a LRR operator who got shot in the neck. The operators loaded up the two bodies and made their getaway, while being shot at by Abu Sayyaf and Moro Islamic Liberation Front.|$|E
