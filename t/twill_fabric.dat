2500|$|On 22 May 1940, {{eight days}} after the {{formation}} of the LDV, it was announced by the War Office that 250,000 field service caps were to be distributed as {{the first part of the}} uniform of the new force and that khaki brassards or [...] "armlets" [...] were being manufactured, each carrying the letters [...] "LDV" [...] in black. In the meantime, LDV units improvised their own brassards with whatever materials were available; local Women's Voluntary Service branches were often asked to produce these, sometimes using old puttees donated by veterans. The British Army used loose-fitting work clothes called [...] "Overalls, Denim" [...] which were made of khaki-coloured cotton <b>twill</b> <b>fabric</b> and consisted of a short jacket or [...] "blouse" [...] and trousers. They were cut to the same style as, and designed to be worn over, the 1938 pattern Battle Dress. It was announced that 90,000 sets of denim overalls would be released from military stores at once and that more would be issued as soon as they could be manufactured. On 25 June, Anthony Eden announced in the House of Commons that LDV uniform was intended [...] "to consist of one suit of overalls of design similar to that of battle dress, a field service cap, and an armlet bearing the letters 'L.D.V.'". On 30 July 1940, Eden further announced that the Home Guard (as the LDV had been renamed) would be issued with military boots as supplies became available.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Twill</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{technically}} have a {{front and}} a back side, unlike plain weave, whose two sides are the same. The front side of the twill is called the technical face and the back the technical back. The technical face side of a <b>twill</b> weave <b>fabric</b> is the side with the most pronounced wale; it is usually more durable and more attractive, is most often used as the fashion side of the fabric, and is the side visible during weaving. If there are warp floats on the technical face (i.e. if the warp crosses over two or more wefts), there will be filling floats (the weft will cross over two or more warps) on the technical back. If the twill wale goes up to the right on one side, it will {{go up to the}} left on the other side. <b>Twill</b> <b>fabrics</b> have no [...] "up" [...] and [...] "down" [...] as they are woven.|$|R

The weave is usually twill or plain. <b>Twilled</b> <b>fabrics</b> such as whipcord, gabardine and serge are often made from worsted yarn. Worsted fabric made from wool has a natural recovery, meaning that it is resilient and quickly returns to its natural shape, but non-glossy worsted will shine with use or abrasion.|$|R

The Thps-urea-TMM flame retardant with added polyacrylate im-parted better overall physical properties to 100 % cotton fabric than to cotton blend fabrics. Treatments containing polyacrylates with low glass transition temperatures produced fabrics with the highest abrasion resistance, tearing strength and wrinkle recovery.

3000|$|... 150  g/m 2 plain fabrics (i.e. sample A, B and C) do {{not show}} any {{significant}} difference in their fabric stiffness. Among plain, <b>twill</b> and satin <b>fabrics</b> of 200  g/m 2 weight (i.e. sample D, E and F), {{it is observed that}} satin fabric with longer floats and few interlacement points offer lower stiffness than plain and <b>twill</b> <b>fabrics.</b> More regular pattern in plain weave and diagonal line pattern in twill weave make the fabric stiffer. Heavier fabric with coarser yarns offers higher stiffness as compared to lighter fabrics. Further, the stiffness force increases with increasing concentration level of antibacterial and fluoropolymer finishes for all fabric samples which may be due to increase in fabric thickness. Results are statistically significant at 95 % confidence level. The fabric samples shows highest stiffness at concentration level of 3 % antibacterial finish and 7 % of fluoropolymer finish.|$|R

40|$|The contact {{resistance}} of two interlacing electro-conductive yarns {{embedded in a}} hybrid woven fabric will constitute a problem for electro-conductive textiles under certain circumstances. A high {{contact resistance}} can induce hotspots, while a variable contact resistance may cause malfunctioning of the components that are interconnected by the electro-conductive yarns. Moreover, the contact robustness should be preserved over time and various treatments such as washing or abrading should not alter {{the functioning of the}} electro-conductive textiles. The electrical resistance developed in the contact point of two interlacing electro-conductive yarns is the result of various factors. The influence of diameter of the electro-conductive stainless steel yarns, the weave pattern, the weft density, and the abrasion on the contact resistance was investigated. Hybrid polyester fabrics were produced according to the design of experiments (DoE) and statistical models were found that describe the variation of the contact resistance with the selected input parameters. It was concluded that the diameter of the stainless steel warp and weft yarns has a statistically significant influence on the contact resistance regardless of the weave. Weft density had a significant influence on the contact resistance but only in case of the <b>twill</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Abrasion led to an increase in contact resistance regardless of the weave pattern and the type of stainless steel yarn that was used. Finally, a combination of parameters that leads to plain and <b>twill</b> <b>fabrics</b> with low contact resistance and robust contacts is recommended...|$|R

50|$|During World War II, Brandon Mill prospered with {{government}} orders for duck cloth, medical gauze, and uniform <b>twill</b> <b>fabric.</b> In December 1946, Abney Mills bought {{the assets of}} Brandon Corporation and began selling the mill village houses. Although textile mills remained reasonably prosperous during the 1950s and '60s, textile manufacturers began offshoring—moving operations outside the United States to countries where labor costs were cheaper. Brandon Mill reduced its workforce in 1969, and the mill closed in 1977.|$|E
5000|$|Herringbone, {{also called}} Broken Twill Weave {{describes}} a distinctive V-shaped weaving pattern usually found in <b>twill</b> <b>fabric.</b> It is distinguished from a plain chevron by the break at reversal, {{which makes it}} resemble a broken zigzag. The pattern is called herringbone because it resembles the skeleton of a herring fish. Herringbone-patterned fabric is usually wool, {{and is one of}} the most popular cloths used for suits and outerwear. Tweed cloth is often woven with a herringbone pattern.|$|E
30|$|When each {{individual}} treatment group was considered, {{there was an}} interesting finding on the soil release group. The plain woven soil release fabric {{was found to have}} a significantly longer time to second degree burn (4.5  ±  2.1  s) than the twill woven soil release fabric (2.9  ±  1.1  s) (F 3, 95  =  13.27, p ≤  0.001), which was the inverse of the overall effect of fabric type on time to second degree burn. The plain woven soil release fabric also had a significantly lower total absorbed energy for all layers (228.3  ±  15.9  kJ m− 2) than the twill woven soil release fabric (278.2  ±  17.8  kJ m− 2) at the upper sensor (F 3, 96  =  21.94, p ≤  0.001). This significant interaction between fabric type and finish was due to the presence of the soil release finish. Typically the heavier-weight twill-weave fabrics offered better protection against predicted burn injury than plain weave fabrics. The soil release finish fabric was the exception to this trend. Soil release finishes applied to the fabric diffuses water under the soil to help remove this soil during laundering (Kissa 1981). The higher absorbed energy found for the <b>twill</b> weave <b>fabrics</b> {{may be due to the}} nature of the finish as the soil-release finish has the ability to reabsorb and remove soil from the fabric (Kissa 1981). This process of drawing in moisture may be the reason for absorbing more energy. As the <b>twill</b> woven <b>fabrics</b> are heavier and thicker than the plain woven fabrics it is possible that this added effect of absorbing more hot liquid made the <b>twill</b> <b>fabrics</b> store more energy than the plain fabrics.|$|R

40|$|Two {{groups of}} fabric samples: six 100 % cotton <b>twill</b> <b>fabrics</b> with {{different}} level of wrinklefree treatment, and six 100 % cotton <b>twill</b> <b>fabrics</b> without wrinkle-free treatment were experimentally studied. These fabrics {{were tested in}} terms of nitrogen content, swelling index (water retention), tear strength and dynamic water absorption rate. The nitrogen content was considered as a probably better indicator {{of the level of}} wrinkle-free treatment than the swelling index (water retention) commonly used in the industry. In this work, the relationship between the nitrogen content and swelling index (water retention) were studied. The effects of nitrogen content and swelling index (water retention) on the tear strength and the dynamic water absorbency were investigatedThe results showed that(1) The swelling index (water retention) has a strong linear relationship with the total nitrogen content in the fabric. The higher nitrogen content, the lower the swelling index (water retention). (2) The fabric tear strength is highly correlated with the total nitrogen content or the swelling index (water retention). High nitrogen content or low swelling index (water retention), which may be resulted from the wrinkle-free treatment, causes low tear strength. (3) High nitrogen content or low swelling index (water retention) reduces the water absorption rate of the fabric and increases the contact angle when the water drop is in initial contact of the fabric. In general, the study showed that swelling index (water retention), a simple test commonly used in the industry, is as good a parameter as the nitrogen content, which is difficult to measure, for evaluating the level of wrinkle-free treatment. Wrinkle-free treatment can generally reduce the tear strength and the dynamic water absorption rate. The former is a property important to fabric durability and the latter is a property important to clothing comfort. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

5000|$|Research on {{the trade}} of jean fabric shows that it emerged in the cities of Genoa, Italy, and Nîmes, France.

50|$|The fewer interlacings in twills as {{compared}} to other weaves allow the yarns to move more freely, and therefore they are softer and more pliable, and drape better than plain-weave textiles.

5000|$|In 1947, a {{body was}} {{discovered}} in the Borremose bog about one kilometre away from the Borremose Man. The corpse {{is believed to be}} female, although decomposition made it difficult to be sure. The bog body was lying face down two feet deep on a base of birch bark. In the immediate vicinity were birch branches; directly on the body were three approximately 10 cm birch poles of the same thickness. The skull was fractured and the brain was visible. [...] The upper torso was naked while the lower body was covered by a cloak made of a four layered <b>twill</b> <b>fabric</b> and a fringed shawl. These two articles of clothing are now on display at the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen. It is uncertain if the body had been clothed at the time it had been deposited, because the clothing from plant materials such as flax fibers can be passed in the acidic peat. A leather cord with an amber bead and bronze plate were around the neck. The skull was crushed and the right leg was broken below the knee. The bones of an infant and a ceramic jar were lying nearby. [...] Because the body was largely decayed, further forensic analysis was hampered. Later carbon dating placed the age of the remains to about 400 BCE.|$|E

30|$|Among 150  g/m 2 fabrics of {{different}} materials (i.e. sample A, B and C) air permeability is highest for 100 % polyester filament fabric because of smooth and hairiness free yarns (Table  3). Hairy yarns in 100 % cotton and cotton blends offers more {{resistance to air flow}} and therefore lead to lower air permeability. Among plain, twill and satin fabrics of 200  g/m 2 weight (i.e. sample D, E and F), satin woven fabric offers highest air permeability, whereas <b>twill</b> <b>fabric</b> shows the least. This {{is due to}} the longer floats and larger pore sizes (Table  2) in satin structure. <b>Twill</b> <b>fabric</b> with compact structure offer the lowest air permeability.

40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} an optoelectronic setup designed {{to evaluate the}} surface parameters of fabrics that influence their tactile feel. The developed texturometer uses the periodic structure of a textile material {{and its ability to}} reflect light to evaluate its surface properties through its polarimetric properties. The device scans the surface with a laser line and performs a temporal Fourier analysis of the reflected light, which allows us to consider the periodical structure of the material's surface. Instead of using the overall reflected energy, the analysis is performed on the degree of polarization of light. Results obtained with this new texturometer are compared to those obtained with a nonpolarimetric device that uses overall reflected energy. Emerized and nonemerized <b>twill</b> <b>fabrics</b> are tested, as well as spun-bonded nonwovens. We show that discrimination between samples is enhanced with this polarimetric texturometer. For emerized fabrics, the results exhibit a decrease in depolarization as emerizing intensity increases.
