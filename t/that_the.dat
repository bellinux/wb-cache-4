5|$|Charlotte Shaw's mother {{subsequently}} sued Edgehill College and {{the teacher}} leading the expedition for negligence. The judgement given on 28 June 2012 found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> teacher had given clear instructions <b>that</b> <b>the</b> group should not attempt to cross Walla Brook but should instead go round it. It further found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> intervention of a passerby, who suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> group could cross the brook, had meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> school could not {{be held responsible for}} the accident. It said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> failure of two teachers to meet up with the group as planned was not incompetence. The judge therefore rejected the claim.|$|E

5|$|The court {{rejected}} the defendant's other arguments: (1) {{that women were}} improperly excluded from the grand jury under Illinois law (as incorporated by federal jury selection law at the time); (2) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> indictment was not returned in open court because the notation indicating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> indictment was returned in open court was added after the fact; (3) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> indictment was insufficiently definite; (4) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction; (5) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> admission of certain evidence was prejudicial; and (6) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> trial judge's own questioning of certain witnesses and limitations on cross-examination were prejudicial.|$|E

5|$|A {{debate on}} whether the {{military}} photos {{should or should not}} be released to the public has taken place.

Those in opposition to a release of the photos expressed concern <b>that</b> <b>the</b> photos would inflame anti-American sentiment in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} authors have noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two explanations, as a {{chemical}} defence against predators {{and as a}} chemical defence against ectoparasites, are not mutually exclusive, and evidence for both explanations exists. The fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> highest concentrations of toxins are bound in the feathers of the breast and belly, in both pitohuis and ifrits, has caused scientists to suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> toxins rub off on eggs and nestlings providing protection against predators and nest parasites.|$|E

If the court is satisfied that such reasonable grounds exist, it may make an interim judgment of presumption of death and of divorce. In such proceedings, the fact that for seven years or more the other party to the marriage has been continually absent from the applicant, and the applicant has no reason to believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> other party has been living within that time, is evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> missing person is dead until the contrary is proved.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of Kameo release, lead {{designer}} George Andreas felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> original Kameo concept of finding and using monsters had evolved and carried through to the final product.

Years later, Andreas reappraised and said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game should never have been released and remains a sore subject for him to discuss. Since the project was nearly finished, they had opted for launch title release instead of starting over. Andreas felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> effort to conceal the fairy Kameo as an elf was unsuccessful and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> character did not match the Xbox's first-person shooter demographic.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{possible}} single-egg clutch and the bird's large size, it has been proposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dodo was K-selected, meaning that it produced a low number of altricial offspring, which required parental care until they matured. Some evidence, including the large size {{and the fact that}} tropical and frugivorous birds have slower growth rates, indicates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bird may have had a protracted development period. The fact that no juvenile dodos have been found in the Mare aux Songes swamp may indicate that they produced little offspring, that they matured rapidly, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> breeding grounds were far away from the swamp, or <b>that</b> <b>the</b> risk of miring was seasonal.|$|E
