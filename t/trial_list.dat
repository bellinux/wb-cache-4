Though her health progressively worsened, she said nothing to List or her physicians until 1969, when a thorough workup revealed the diagnosis.

40|$|Background: We {{determined}} {{the pattern of}} clinically significant cognitive impairment (CI) among older veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) evaluated in a memory disorders clinic. Methods: Data were collected from 19 ethnically diverse veterans. Cognitive functioning in six domains (verbal learning, memory, attention, language, executive functioning, and information processing speed) was assessed. Results: The majority of veterans (57 %) demonstrated CI on a measure of single <b>trial</b> <b>list</b> learning, 44 % exhibited CI on short delay memory for lists, and 31 % exhibited CI in long delay memory for lists. CI on measures of memory for stories (14 %) and executive functioning (6 %) were less common, {{and none of the}} participants demonstrated CI on measures of attention, language, or information processing speed. Conclusions: CI on measures of single <b>trial</b> <b>list</b> learning and memory for lists are common in older patients with PTSD evaluated in a memory disorders clinic and are likely to contribute to functional deficits.

40|$|Prosecutors and {{criminal}} defense attorneys {{would do well}} to consider how civil trial lawyers fashion their opening statements. As with any other part of the trial, the primary question to be answered in constructing an opening statement is: What do I want to accomplish? In civil cases the answer is almost always that each lawyer wants to persuade the jurors that the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s version of the dispute {{is more likely to be}} correct than the opponent 2 ̆ 7 s. Opening statements in criminal trials, however, do not usually sound as if they were constructed with that goal in mind. Most fall into two categories: (1) long and detailed recitations of the evidence and the witnesses who will produce it, and (2) perfunctory appearances to comply with the <b>trial</b> <b>list</b> of ‘things to do’ that includes ‘give opening statement. ...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: Previous {{research}} examining {{mild cognitive impairment}} (MCI) has highlighted the heterogeneity of outcome in MCI sufferers. MCI is associated with greater risk of progression to dementia; however, a substantial proportion of those identified with MCI have alternative outcomes including recovery to unimpaired status. This heterogeneity may in part reflect insufficient sensitivity and specificity in identifying subclinical memory impairment. Method: The present study examined learning {{in a sample of}} 109 adults aged 61 – 91 years with persistent amnestic MCI, persistent non-amnestic MCI, recovered MCI and healthy controls. At the final assessment point, learning for words recalled across each trial of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test was examined for each group. Results: It was found that persistent amnestic MCI participants displayed significantly lower learning compared with recovered MCI and healthy control groups. Discussion: The results of this study indicated that poor learning across trials may be a defining feature of persistent amnestic MCI. Further research is required to establish the predictive utility of within <b>trial</b> <b>list</b> learning performance to identify individuals with persistent and progressive variants of MCI...|$|E

40|$|Chemotherapy has {{improved}} survival in {{many types of}} cancer. However, {{it can lead to}} a range of toxic side effects that can occur while the patient is on treatment but may also appear months or years later. One of the more serious harmful side-effects of chemotherapy is heart disease and anthracycline chemotherapy is particularly implicated in this. Observational {{studies have shown that the}} risk of congestive heart failure in anthracycline treated patients rises rapidly after cumulative doses of about 400 mg/m 2, but that there is also some risk below this dose. This thesis explored several methodological issues that affect meta-analyses of harms. First meta-analyses of harms often include terms for those harms in their search strategies. Evaluation of a trial search including cardiac terms against the <b>trial</b> <b>list</b> maintained by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group showed that only 48 % of their trials were found. After cardiac terms were removed from the search strategy, 87 % of the EBCTCG trials were found. Second, anthracycline cardiotoxicity is often not reported in a manner that enables data to be extracted for meta-analyses. To address this, risk of outcome reporting bias in trials included in this thesis was assessed. There was a high risk of outcome reporting bias for cardiac morbidity in 50 % of trials, and 35 % of trials had high risk of outcome reporting bias for cardiac mortality. Third, previous meta-analyses of anthracycline cardiotoxicity included only a limited number of trials. In order to increase the amount of information about anthracycline cardiotoxicity available for meta-analysis, a method was devised for including confounded trials in the meta-analysis, taking into account prior knowledge as to the likely effect of other drugs on cardiotoxicity. Finally, published and individual patient data meta-analyses of cardiac death in randomised trials of anthracycline versus not were undertaken. The published data meta-analysis included 32 trials, 9 of which were unconfounded, and found a 36 % (95 % CI 1 - 83 %) increased risk of cardiac death in anthracycline-allocated patients compared to those not allocated to anthracycline. No conclusions could be drawn about the effect of confounder drugs on the risk of cardiac death. A meta-analysis grouped by lower and higher dose showed that there was a statistically significant increase in risk of cardiac death in anthracycline allocated patients compared to those not allocated anthracyclines in the higher dose group only (OR= 1. 74, 95 %CI 1. 15 â 2. 62). In conclusion, this thesis has generated new insights into the methods used for meta-analyses of harms. It has also produced a new risk estimate of cardiac death in anthracycline-treated patients that clinicians can use to inform their treatment decisions. </p...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Clear, {{clinically}} relevant taxonomies {{of complex}} rehabilitation interventions {{are essential to}} enable objective evidence synthesis within systematic reviews. Classifications of current physiotherapy treatment approaches are generally inadequately defined, difficult to apply objectively, and lack universal international acceptance or interpretation. We aimed to determine an internationally, clinically relevant taxonomy of physiotherapy treatment approaches using language and terminology agreed by physiotherapists and stroke survivors. Method: We systematically extracted descriptions of physiotherapy approaches from the trials currently included in the Cochrane review, and from foreign-language <b>trials</b> <b>listed</b> as ‘awaiting assessment’. We convened a stakeholder group, comprising 13 purposively selected stroke survivors, carers and physiotherapists. Nominal group techniques were used to reach consensus decisions. The group debated the treatment components described within the trials of physiotherapy approaches, reached consensus on key types of intervention components, agreed descriptions of components and determined categorisation for synthesis of evidence within an update of a Cochrane review.
