30|$|When pH {{increases}} from 2 to 11, <b>the</b> percentage <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fluoride ion increases up to 7, {{and then}} onwards, <b>the</b> percentage <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fluoride ion decreases.

30|$|As can be {{inferred}} from the graphs that <b>the</b> percentage <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fluoride ion increases rapidly with increase in adsorbent dosage and after optimum dosage of 4.0  g/l, {{there has been no}} significant change in <b>the</b> percentage <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fluoride ion.|$|R

5|$|In November 1651, Cromwell's troops {{called on}} Ogilvie to surrender, but he refused. During the {{subsequent}} blockade of the castle, <b>the</b> <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Honours of Scotland was planned by Elizabeth Douglas, wife of Sir George Ogilvie, and Christian Fletcher, wife of James Granger, minister of Kinneff Parish Church. The king's papers were first {{removed from the}} castle by Anne Lindsay, a kinswoman of Elizabeth Douglas, who walked through the besieging force with the papers sewn into her clothes. Two stories exist regarding <b>the</b> <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> honours themselves. Fletcher stated in 1664 that {{over the course of}} three visits to the castle in February and March 1652, she carried away the crown, sceptre, sword and sword-case hidden amongst sacks of goods. Another account, given in the 18th century by a tutor to the Earl Marischal, records that the honours were lowered from the castle onto the beach, where they were collected by Fletcher's servant and carried off in a creel (basket) of seaweed. Having smuggled the honours from the castle, Fletcher and her husband buried them under the floor of the Old Kirk at Kinneff.|$|E

5|$|Not all {{withdrawal}} {{effects are}} evidence of true dependence or withdrawal.

Either of these can occur without the person actually being drug-dependent.|$|E

The method for defeating Mantis was also changed from using the second controller to simply using the keyboard (regardless of whether the player was using a game controller or not up to that point). Other omissions include <b>the</b> <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eighth Codec frequency (140.07), which featured written commentaries by the developers, Meryl's alternate sneaking suit outfit, and the mission logs when loading a save file. However, the PC version adds the option to toggle moving and shooting in first-person view mode at any time regardless of difficulty setting, and players can now save their progress at any point without contacting Mei-Ling {{through the use of}} quick saves. On the VR training portion, all 300 missions, as well as the photoshoot mode, are available from the start, although the three unlockable preview trailers from the PlayStation version have been removed.|$|E
