5|$|The Guianan cock-of-the-rock breeds in {{the early}} months of the year and, on average, lays its eggs around March. During the height of the mating season, males engage in {{competitive}} displays in lek, which is a complex courting behaviour <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> to attract females. Males and females live separately except when the females choose a mate. The mating success varies based on multiple factors, ranging from the plumage exhibited by a male to the composition of the lek itself. The females choose a male by flying down to the ground and pecking the male on his rump. The male then turns around and the mating takes place almost immediately. There is speculation that the male-to-male competition {{is an important factor in}} lek formation and breeding. The main predators of the Guianan cock-of-the-rock are harpy eagles and black-and-white hawk-eagles.|$|E
5|$|Every {{game in the}} SmackDown vs. Raw series used to {{have the}} amount of damage inflicted to the player's chosen superstar, {{measured}} with a meter on the HUD, where a design of a male figure presented the damage. As a move was performed against a superstar, the affected area of the body flashed—the more damage <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> to that specific body part, {{the more likely it}} is for the superstar to submit. Colors were used to represent the amount of damage done to a specific body area; yellow represented minimal damage, orange represented moderate damage, and red represented maximum damage. This was however taken out of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010. Now the only way to tell how damaged the opponent is to watch their physical body actions that indicate how hurt they are. The more damage inflicted to opponents, {{the more likely it is}} for them to lose the match. There are four ways to win a match in every game: by pinfall, submission, knockout, countout; alternatively, the match could end in a draw. With the introduction of an on-screen referee in WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It, the ability to win by disqualification was also included.|$|E

25|$|Arthroplasty is an {{orthopedic}} surgery where the articular {{surface of a}} musculoskeletal joint is replaced, remodeled, or realigned by osteotomy or some other procedure. It is an elective procedure <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> to relieve pain and restore function to the joint after damage by arthritis (rheumasurgery) or some other type of trauma. As well as the standard total knee replacement surgery, the uni-compartmental knee replacement, in which only one weight-bearing surface of an arthritic knee is replaced, is a popular alternative.|$|E
25|$|Long base line, LBL. This {{consists}} of an array {{of at least three}} transponders. The initial position of the transponders is determined by USBL and/ or by measuring the baselines between the transponders. Once <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>done,</b> only the ranges to the transponders need to be measured to determine a relative position. The position should theoretically be located at the intersection of imaginary spheres, one around each transponder, with a radius equal to the time between transmission and reception multiplied by the speed of sound through water. Because angle measurement is not necessary, the accuracy in large water depths is better than USBL.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Navy has {{periodically}} {{monitored the}} environmental {{conditions of the}} site since the sinking and has reported the results in an annual public report on environmental monitoring for U.S. nuclear-powered ships and boats. The reports provide specifics on the environmental sampling of sediment, water, and marine life <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> to ascertain whether the submarine has significantly affected the deep-ocean environment. The reports also explain the methodology for conducting this deep sea monitoring from both surface vessels and submersibles. The monitoring data confirm {{that there has been}} no significant effect on the environment. The nuclear fuel aboard the submarine remains intact and no uranium in excess of levels expected from the fallout from past atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons has been detected by the Navy's inspections. In addition, Scorpion carried two nuclear-tipped Mark 45 anti-submarine torpedoes (ASTOR) when she was lost. The warheads of these torpedoes are part of the environmental concern. The most likely scenario is that the plutonium and uranium cores of these weapons corroded to a heavy, insoluble material soon after the sinking, and they remain at or close to their original location inside the torpedo room of the boat. If the corroded materials were released outside the submarine, their density and insolubility would cause them to settle into the sediment.|$|E

500|$|Shakespeare is also {{careful to}} make the {{distinction}} that Prospero presents himself as a rational, and not an occultist, magician. He does this by providing a contrast to him in Sycorax. Sycorax {{is said to have}} worshipped the devil and been full of [...] "earthy and abhored commands". She was unable to control Ariel, who was [...] "too delicate" [...] for such dark tasks. Prospero's rational goodness enables him to control Ariel where Sycorax can only trap him in a tree. Sycorax's magic is frequently described as destructive and terrible, where Prospero's is said to be wondrous and beautiful. Prospero seeks to set things right in his world through his magic, and once <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>done,</b> he renounces it, setting Ariel free.|$|E
500|$|Based in London, {{where the}} company employs 10 tailors in three workshops, it also employs an {{additional}} 40 in a workshop in China where most of its entry-level, machine-sewn suits are made. All suits are made from British or Italian cloth, and are available either in [...] "machine grade" [...] or [...] "hand stitched". Suit prices vary based on the cloth that is used {{as well as the}} amount of hand-stitching <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> on the suit. The fully hand-made suits require around 50 hours of stitching, include a basted fitting, and conform to all the specifications for a bespoke suit suggested by the Savile Row Bespoke Association. Prices are kept lower than the average for bespoke tailors by requiring payment up-front. This allows Cad and the Dandy to negotiate discounts of 30% to 40% with their suppliers.|$|E
500|$|When a final {{agreement}} was reached with the Republican legislative leadership, Dayton called a special session of the legislature on July 19. The legislature met on July 20 and passed the budget bills, which were signed the same day by the governor. Most state employees returned to work on July 21, facing a backlog of unfinished work and new problems in many agencies. After the budget was passed, Dayton said he approached Republicans again after meeting with ordinary citizens—who said they wanted government services to resume and did not care how the shutdown was ended—and because he feared a worse budget deal and unease in the DFL legislative minorities. Zellers said when the deal was finalized that in his view it was [...] "a deal {{that we can all}} be disappointed in, but a deal <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>done,</b> a budget that was balanced". His sentiments that a 'balanced' budget needed to be passed, and that both sides had something to be unhappy about, were echoed by Koch.|$|E
