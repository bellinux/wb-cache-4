50|$|A <b>torque</b> <b>sensor,</b> torque {{transducer}} or {{torque meter}} is a device for measuring and recording the torque on a rotating system, {{such as an}} engine, crankshaft, gearbox, transmission, rotor, a bicycle crank or cap torque tester. Static torque {{is relatively easy to}} measure. Dynamic torque, on the other hand, is not easy to measure, since it generally requires transfer of some effect (electric, hydraulic or magnetic) from the shaft being measured to a static system.|$|E

40|$|Experimental Robot Position Sensor Fault Tolerance Using Accelerometers and Joint <b>Torque</b> <b>Sensors</b> Robot {{systems in}} {{critical}} applications, {{such as those}} in space and nuclear environments, must be able to operate during component failure to complete important tasks. One failure mode that has received little attention is the failure of joint position sensors. Current fault tolerant designs require the addition of directly redundant position sensors which can affect joint design. The proposed method uses joint <b>torque</b> <b>sensors</b> found in most existing advanced robot designs along with easily locatable, lightweight accelerometers to provide a joint position sensor fault recovery mode. This mode uses the <b>torque</b> <b>sensors</b> along with a virtual passive control law for stability and accelerometers for joint position information. Two methods for conversion from Cartesian acceleration to joint position based on robot kinematics, not integration, are presented. The fault tolerant control method was tested on several joints of a laboratory robot. The controllers performed well with noisy, biased data and a model with uncertain parameters. I...|$|R
50|$|Most {{feathering}} {{systems for}} reciprocating engines sense {{a drop in}} oil pressure and move the blades toward the feather position, and require the pilot to pull the propeller control back to disengage the high-pitch stop pins before the engine reaches idle RPM. Turboprop control systems usually utilize a negative <b>torque</b> <b>sensor</b> in the reduction gearbox which moves the blades toward feather when the engine is no longer providing power to the propeller. Depending on design, the pilot may have to push a button to override the high-pitch stops and complete the feathering process, or the feathering process may be totally automatic.|$|E

Part of the Dexterous End Effector (DEE) experiment, the system used a mirror {{near the end of}} the arm, flashing light-emitting diodes, a cargo bay camera and a portable computer to assist an astronaut in finely aligning the arm. The Dexterous End Effector (DEE) experiment also looked at the forces generated by arm movements when its magnetic end effector was engaged.

5000|$|Behind {{the engine}} the {{fuselage}} was conical, tapering to the tail. Instead of a side-mounted anti-torque tail rotor the Nord used a system patented by its designer where an axially driven pusher propeller, rotating within a circular shroud, forced air through four rotatable, vertical airfoils {{mounted on the}} shroud trailing edge. The shroud was intended to protect the propeller from the rotor downwash, to guard the propeller from objects {{on the ground and}} protect ground staff from the propeller. Air deflected from the blades balanced rotor torque automatically, using information from an hydraulic <b>torque</b> <b>sensor,</b> and also controlled yaw.

5000|$|One {{design for}} {{measuring}} the torque applied to the steering wheel has a <b>torque</b> <b>sensor</b> - a torsion bar {{at the lower end}} of the steering column. As the steering wheel rotates, so does the steering column, as well as the upper end of the torsion bar. Since the torsion bar is relatively thin and flexible, and the bottom end usually resists being rotated, the bar will twist by an amount proportional to the applied torque. The difference in position between the opposite ends of the torsion bar controls a valve. The valve allows fluid to flow to the cylinder which provides steering assistance; the greater the [...] "twist" [...] of the torsion bar, the greater the force.|$|E
5000|$|Measuring {{the power}} output of a top fuel engine {{directly}} {{is not always}} feasible. Certain models use a <b>torque</b> <b>sensor</b> incorporated {{as part of the}} RacePak data system. Dynamometers that can measure the output of a Top Fuel engine exist; however, the main limitation is that a Top Fuel engine cannot be run at its maximum power output for more than 10 seconds without overheating or possibly destroying itself explosively. Making such high power levels from such relatively limited displacement is a result of using very high boost levels and running at extremely high RPMs; both of these stress the internal components to a high degree, meaning that the peak power can only safely be achieved for brief periods of time, and even then only by intentionally sacrificing components. The engine power output can also be calculated based upon the car's weight and its performance. The calculated power output of these engines is most likely somewhere between , which is about twice as powerful as the engines installed on some modern diesel locomotives, with a torque output of approximately [...] and a brake mean effective pressure of [...]|$|E

40|$|This reseach is {{concerned}} with impedance control of a manipulator which exerts stable contact task. The method controls dynamic interaction between a robot and its environment by changing the apparent mechanical impedance of the manipulator.

30|$|The {{magnetic}} <b>torque</b> <b>sensor</b> {{has many}} advantages, such as durability, wide application, high reliability, and good prospects for development. It is widely concerned by researchers. ShaoPeng studied a ring <b>torque</b> <b>sensor</b> [7] {{based on the}} counter magnetostriction effect of amorphous alloy. It used the method of sticking the ribbon of the amorphous alloy. However, it was large, not easy to install, and not easy to monitor the torque in real time. Meng et al. studied a non-contact <b>torque</b> <b>sensor</b> [8] based on the change of magnetic induction, which was not suitable for dynamic measurement of torque because it needed manually adjusting two digital potentiometers. Muro et al. studied a ring <b>torque</b> <b>sensor</b> [9] based on the measurement of magnetic field by the Hall detection circuit, and magnetostrictive effect whose measuring range was small. Jiles studied the theory of magnetomechanical effects [10] and it provided a theoretical basis for the magnetic <b>torque</b> <b>sensor.</b> Sablik et al. studied the magnetostriction when the magnetic shaft suffered a tensile or compressive stress and applied a magnetic field. The stress and magnetic field were coaxial [11]. The <b>torque</b> <b>sensor</b> proposed in this paper uses the non-contact signal extraction circuit to detect the deflection angle of magnetization vector and explores {{the relationship between the}} deflection angle and the torque; instead of using the wireless communication equipment, the non-contact torque measurement is realized directly.|$|E

40|$|In {{high speed}} and high {{precision}} machining applications, {{it is important}} to monitor the machining process in order to ensure high product quality. For this purpose, it is essential to develop a dynamometer with high sensitivity and high natural frequency which is suited to these conditions. This paper describes the design, calibration and performance of a milling <b>torque</b> <b>sensor</b> based on piezoresistive MEMS strain.

40|$|International audienceOff-line robot dynamic {{identification}} methods use the Inverse Dynamic Identification Model (IDIM), which calculates {{the motor}} torques that are linear {{in relation to}} the dynamic parameters of both links and drive chains, and use linear least squares technique (IDIM-LS technique). For most robots, the only available data are the motor position and the motor torques which are calculated as the product of the known current reference signal by the joint drive gains. Then the accuracy of links parameters may be limited by noise and error modeling in the drive chains. The Kuka LWR robot (industrial version IIWA: Intelligent Industrial Work Assistant) gives the possibility for an industrial robot to investigate this problem using the joint <b>torque</b> <b>sensors</b> data, measured at the output of the harmonic drive geared drive chains, to identify only the links inertial parameters without the errors coming from the drive chains.

Incorporating the components of <b>torque</b> <b>sensor</b> technology reduces the human effort immensely by providing assistance from the battery bank to drive a hub motor while maneuvering the wheelchair using the <b>torque</b> <b>sensor</b> pedal.
