5|$|Geography affects {{solar energy}} {{potential}} because {{areas that are}} closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation. However, the use of photovoltaics that can follow {{the position of the}} sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator. Time variation effects <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>of</b> solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation {{on the surface of the}} Earth for solar panels to absorb. This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day. Cloud cover can affect <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>of</b> solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.|$|E
