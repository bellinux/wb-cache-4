40|$|As device size scales down, {{there have}} been {{challenges}} to design conventional analog circuits, such as low voltage headroom and the low intrinsic gain of a device. Although ever-decreasing device channel length in CMOS technology has mainly negative effects on analog circuits, it increases device speed and reduces the power consumption of digital circuits. As a result, time-based signal processing has been attracting attention because time-based circuits take advantage of high speed and low power devices to deal with analog information in the time domain. In this thesis, we focus on a ring oscillator as a core <b>time-based</b> <b>circuit</b> for communication systems. Ring oscillators are employed in analog-to-time conversion or time-to-digital conversion. In this work, we present A/D converters and an RF modulator based on ring oscillators in deep sub-micron CMOS processes. We introduce a VCO-based [sigma][delta] A/D converter utilizing a voltage-controlled ring oscillator (ring VCO) as a continuous-time integrator. We propose to replace conventional integrators designed with analog circuits in a [sigma][delta] modulator with a ring VCO and a phase detector, thereby implementing an A/D converter without traditional analog circuits. We also propose a single-slope A/D converter using time-to-digital conversion. By combining a few analog circuits and a ring oscillator based Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC), we achieve highly digital A/D conversion. Finally, we demonstrate a VCO-based RF modulator. The proposed RF modulator generates an RF signal by simply switching transistors. As opposed to an RFDAC approach, the proposed RF modulator is not limited by quantization noise because it employs multiphase PWM signals. A VCO-based OP amp is also introduced as an alternative method of designing an OP amp in deep sub-micron CMOS. The proposed VCO-based OP amp is utilized to generate the multiphase PWM signals in the RF modulator. This thesis also presents the fundamental limitations of a ring oscillator as a timebased circuit. Although the idea of time-based signal processing employing a ring oscillator has its own limitations such as non-linear tuning characteristics and phase noise, the basic idea is worth investigating to solve the serious problems of analog circuits for future CMOS technology. by Min Park.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to develop and test integrated CMOS circuits for radiation tolerant <b>time-based</b> <b>circuits</b> with picosecond accuracy for nuclear applications and high-energy physics. The main applications for which these circuits were developed, are time-based readout interfaces in high-energy physics particle detectors, clock generation and data-transmission for these detectors. During {{this research}}, a radiation tolerant Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) and a low noise clock synthesizer were designed and optimized for the particle detectors at CERN. A short overview on the radiation effects and mitigation techniques to ionizing radiation is given, together with a discussion on the practical aspects which are required in modern TDCs and frequency synthesizers. A high-resolution TDC is presented with a discussion on the design aspects and the practical implementations of the circuit which are required in nuclear environments. The TDC is based on a Delay-Locked Loop (DLL) that has two phase detection circuits to boost the recovery time after an energetic particle disturbs the circuit. The functionality of the DLL ensures that the timing resolution of the TDC remains the same after irradiation. Furthermore, this DLL has a new phase detector architecture which reduces static-phase offsets in the phase detectors through a correlated sampling mechanism which has been implemented {{for the first time in}} the time domain. The circuit was prototyped in a 40 nm CMOS technology and a 4. 8 ps resolution was measured with a 4. 2 mW power consumption. DLL based TDCs or serial communication links do require a low-noise, high-frequency reference clock. For a 64 channel TDC, a 2. 56 GHz frequency synthesizer was designed to upconvert the 40 MHz reference clock of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN to a 2. 56 GHz high speed clock with a targeted rms jitter below 1 ps. A radiation hardened Phase Locked Loop was designed in which both an LC-tank oscillator and ring oscillator were present. The chip was prototyped in a 65 nm COS technology. These circuits were, in a next step, irradiated to make a comparison between ring and LC-tank oscillators in terms of noise, radiation damage and single-event effects. The devices were irradiated with X-rays up to 600 Mrad to study the Total Ionizing Dose effects on the circuits and were also irradiated with heavy-ions to study the single-event effects on the oscillators. The clock generator has a power consumption of 11. 7 mW and had an integrated rms jitter of only 345 fs. Triple Modular Redundancy was used in the digital circuits to protect them from soft errors. A new phase detector architecture is presented which minimizes the error rate due to high-energy particles in frequency synthesizers. The devices were also tested for temperature variations from - 25 °C up to 125 °C. From the results gathered in the radiation experiments, an improved LC-tank oscillator was designed which has a reduction of the sensitivity to single-event upsets of more than 600 times compared to a traditional implementation which is mainly due to the cross section of the tuning varactor of the oscillator. This technique was also experimentally verified. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|A new {{electronic}} {{revolution is}} arising: the smart environment. This means that sensors and sensor systems are becoming ever {{more important in}} todays society, {{and at the same}} time are getting more and more networked. If all this will be realized, one can speak of real Cyber-Physical Systems and the Internet of Things. There are however still obstacles that need to be tackled for this to become a reality. In order to be able to massively deploy these systems, three main challenges at the hardware level have to be addressed. The first is the power consumption and the corresponding energy consumption. Since these systems need to operate autonomously, only limited energy is available through energy harvesting. Secondly, these systems need to be as robust as possible, because they need to be deployed in all kinds of harsh environments. And thirdly, decreasing the cost is a major challenge in order to be able to deploy these systems at a large scale. Therefore, integration and miniaturization are necessary to meet this requirement. In the past, the scaling of Si CMOS technology has offered the solution to get more for less. However, there has come an end to happy scaling, and traditional amplitude-based sensor interfaces suffer from the decreased voltage headroom in nanometer CMOS technologies. Additionally, these analog sensor interfaces do not really benefit from scaling in terms of chip area reduction. Therefore, this thesis proposes to process the sensor information in the time domain, as time-based implementations can be highly digital, which means that they can benefit from scaling in terms of chip area reduction and increasing timing resolution. Furthermore, ultra-low-voltage design becomes feasible. However, an analysis of the fundamental difference between amplitude- and time-based processing in terms of energy efficiency shows that the fundamental thermal-noise-limited energy efficiency is mainly sensor-dependent. The drive to implement time-based sensor interfaces is thus not based on improving the energy efficiency, but rather on the benefits of the highly-digitalature and the related area/cost scaling. This thesis presents, analyzes and validates through chip implementations one type of such time-based sensor interfaces: the Bang-Bang Phase-Locked-Loop-based Sensor-to-Digital Converter. Basically, the conversion mechanism is based on frequency modulation and demodulation. The proposed highly-digital BBPLL SDC offers the possibility of low-voltage design, small chip area, and low power consumption possibilities due to its digital nature. Additionally, the sensor interface is very robust, as it can suppress common-mode variations such as supply-voltage and temperature variations. It also resembles a modulator, hence benefiting from noise shaping and oversampling. The BBPLL SDC is thoroughly analyzed through analytical analysis and simulations. A complete state-variable-based Matlab model is implemented with all its nonidealities, so that conclusions as close as possible to reality are drawn. The phase noise ofthe oscillators is the key in designing energy-efficient or high-resolution sensor interfaces. The promising BBPLL SDC architecture is validated through several chip implementations. In a first implementation part, three chip implementations are done in silicon CMOS technology. The first design focuses on the direct conversion of sensor information to the time/frequency domain for capacitive sensors by means of a capacitance-controlled oscillator. In this way, power-consuming analog conditioning circuits can be avoided. In addition, the design shows the feasibility of integrating external (MEMS) sensors in on-chip oscillators. The second design is a BBPLL SDC for resistive sensors. It aims to improve the PSRR of traditional Wheatstone-bridge interfaces and shows the robustness of the architecture. It combines in one circuit an improved resilience towards supply-voltage and temperature variations, with low power consumption and good energy efficiency. The two previous implementations are done in a 130 -nm CMOS technology. The third design implementation shows the low-voltage and ultra-low-power possibilities of the BBPLL SDC, by implementing it in a 28 -nm CMOS technology with ultra-low-VT transistors. It is implemented with inverters, D-flipflops and transmission gates only. Furthermore, it presents a technique to improve the linearity of the sensor-to-digital conversion. In the second implementation part, two chip implementations are presented in carbon nanotube (CNT) technology. This work has been done in collaboration with the groups of prof. Mitra and prof. Wong of Stanford University and all the fabrication has been done at the Stanford Nanofabrication Facility. CNT technology is a promising technology to further reduce the energy consumption in electronics, as it is projected that it can achieve an order of magnitude improvement in energy-delay product compared to Si CMOS at highly-scaled technology nodes. In addition, CNTs are excellent candidates to be implemented as sensors, due to their large surface-area-to-volume ratio. This means that CNT technology is an interesting technology in the search for improved energy efficiency in sensors and sensor interfaces. In the first implementation, a BBPLL SDC for capacitive sensors is implemented entirely using CNFETs and shows that the implementation of larger systems in CNT technology is feasible. The design has been fabricated in a 1 -&# 956;m CNT pMOS-only technology of Stanford University. This design implementation is the first-ever sensor interface circuit implemented entirely using CNFETs. The second design in CNT technology is implemented in a 32 -nm scaled CNT technology and shows the feasibility of scaling in CNT technology in a VLSI-compatible manner. It comprises both a CNFET-based sensor and a <b>time-based</b> sensor interface <b>circuit</b> on a single die. This might be the first step towards future extremely-energy-efficient integrated smart sensor systems. status: publishe...|$|R
