5|$|Peter Molyneux {{stated that}} {{he came up with}} the idea of {{creating}} Theme Park because he felt the business genre was worth pursuing. He said that Theme Park is a game he had always wanted to create, and wanted to avoid the mistakes of his earlier business simulation game, The Entrepreneur: he wanted to create a business simulation game and make it fun so people would want to play it. In an interview, he explained that the primary reason he created Theme Park was because he wanted players to create their dream Theme Park. Another reason is he wanted players to understand <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> running one entails. The three difficulty settings enable players to choose the desired depth: simply having fun creating a theme park, or making all the business decisions too. Molyneux stated that the most difficult part to program was the visitors' behaviour.|$|E

For that reason, she never applied for admission to the Rhode Island bar, her standing at the Boston bar being sufficient for <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> she wanted to do.

Authors {{could not}} sign away their copyrights; they only could grant a publisher a limited {{right to use}} a work for a specific purpose for a limited time (typically five years). For publication, authors had to use standard authors' contracts that were prescribed by the government. Slightly different standard contracts existed for different kinds of works, but they all shared this same basic characteristic. In all cases, the intended use of the work by a publisher was exactly described (e.g. including {{the size of a}} print run for print publications), and if the publisher accepted the delivered work, he was obliged to actually publish it within a set time frame (the first edition had to appear after at most one or two years, depending on <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>work).</b>|$|E
25|$|Dagenett's job was {{to track}} down labor-intensive projects, such as railroad, dam {{construction}} and large-scale agricultural ventures, bargain with the employer to accept {{a certain number of}} Indian workmen, and then notify agency superintendents in the area as to the number of men wanted, <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> and the wages. Dagenett placed 600 men in his first season, and by summer 1906 he had placed 1,100 on the Salton Sea flood control project in Southern California; some 200 on the construction of the Saint Mary's Canal on the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana; more than 200 ballasting on the Santa Fe Railroad; 600 in the sugar-beet fields at Rocky Ford, Colorado; and about 3,000 in other activities, including sheepherding, lumbering, cantaloupe growing, road construction and irrigation projects. The Zuni Dam at Black Rock, New Mexico, was also built by Indian labor. A supervisor with each crew acted as liaison to the employer and was responsible for scheduling, helping the men with problems, and overseeing their health. Though the Indians had to pay for food, clothing and supplies out of their wages, it was reported that they still took home between 60 and 93 percent of the proceeds. Many Indians who showed aptitudes for special kinds of work received training and became skilled workers.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{cited the}} legacy {{aspects of the}} film for Scorsese and {{compared}} Scorsese to such established directors as Ingmar Bergman. Ty Burr of The Boston Globe said, [...] "The movie's being promoted as the third in the director's unofficial trilogy of faith, after The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) and Kundun (1997), and {{it feels like a}} self-conscious masterpiece, a summing-up from a filmmaker who, at 74, may be thinking of his legacy." [...] Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out London gave the film five stars out of five, saying, [...] "Scorsese has hit the rare heights of filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman and Carl Theodor Dreyer, artists who find in religion a battleground that leaves even the strongest in tatters, compromised and broken." [...] Emma Green of The Atlantic gave the film high praise, stating, [...] "This is what makes Scorsese's film so radical and so unlike many movies about religion: It's actually art." [...] Robbie Collin of The Telegraph gave the film five stars out of five, stating, [...] "Scorsese's brutal spiritual epic will scald, and succor, your soul." [...] Collin further added, [...] "It's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> a great filmmaker can only pull off with a lifetime's accrued expertise behind him". Brian Truitt of USA Today gave the film 3 stars and a half out of four, stating, [...] "With the religious historical drama Silence, Martin Scorsese proves he’s as masterful a filmmaker with men of God as he is with gangsters." [...] Truitt also argued that the film [...] "marks one of the deeper and most thoughtful projects in Scorsese’s career." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stevens {{is a rare}} {{example of}} a poet whose main output came at a fairly {{advanced}} age. His first major publication (four poems from a sequence entitled [...] "Phases" [...] in the November 1914 edition of Poetry) was written at age 35, although as an undergraduate at Harvard, Stevens had written poetry and exchanged sonnets with George Santayana, with whom he was close through much of his life. Many of his canonical works were written well after he turned 50. According to the literary critic Harold Bloom, who called Stevens the [...] "best and most representative" [...] American poet of the time, no Western writer since Sophocles has had such a late flowering of artistic genius. His contemporary, Harriet Monroe, termed Stevens [...] "a poet, rich and numerous and profound, provocative of joy, creative beauty in those who can respond to Him". Helen Vendler notes {{that there are three}} distinguishable moods present in Stevens' long poems: ecstasy, apathy, and reluctance between ecstasy and apathy. She also notes that his poetry was highly influenced by the paintings of Paul Klee and Paul Cézanne:Stevens saw in the paintings of both Paul Klee—who was his favorite painter—and Cézanne <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> he wanted to do himself as a Modernist poet. Klee had imagined symbols. Klee is not a directly realistic painter and is full of whimsical and fanciful and imaginative and humorous projections of reality in his paintings. The paintings are often enigmatic or full of riddles, and Stevens liked that as well. What Stevens liked in Cézanne was the reduction, you might say, of the world to a few monumental objects.|$|E
