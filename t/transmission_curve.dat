50|$|The <b>{{transmission}}</b> <b>curve</b> or {{transmission characteristic}} is the mathematical function or graph {{that describes the}} transmission fraction of an optical or electronic filter {{as a function of}} frequency or wavelength. It is an instance of a transfer function but, unlike the case of, for example, an amplifier, output never exceeds input (maximum transmission is 100%). The term is often used in commerce, science, and technology to characterise filters.|$|E

30|$|The {{spectral}} {{dependence of}} the absorption coefficient αglass, found from the <b>transmission</b> <b>curve</b> using the formula (11), is shown in Fig.  8. As can be seen, the absorption coefficient of low-iron solar glass is lower by several orders than those for ITO, SnO 2, CdS, and CdTe. But one {{should keep in mind}} that the thickness of the glass in the CdS/CdTe solar cell (typically 3.2  mm) is at least three orders of magnitude greater than that of the thin-film device components.|$|E

40|$|The {{transmission}} of beta particles is frequently calculated {{in the same}} fashion as that of gamma rays, where the mass attenuation coefficient is defined by the slope of the exponential function. Numerous authors have used this approximation including Evans (1955), Loevinger (1952), and Chabot et. al. (1988). Recent work by McCarthy et. al. (1995) indicated that the exponential function seemed to fit well over a particular region of the <b>transmission</b> <b>curve.</b> Upon further investigation, the author decided to verify McCarthy`s results by the use of different absorber materials and attempt to reproduce the experiments. A theoretical method will be used to estimate the {{transmission of}} the beta particles through the three absorbers, aluminum, zirconium, and iron. An alternate Monte Carlo code, the Electron Gamma Shower version 4 code (EGS 4) will also be used to verify that the experiment is approximating a pencil beam of beta particles. Although these two methods offer a good cross check for the experimental data, they pose a conflict in regards to the type of beam that is to be generated. The experimental lab setup uses a collimated beam of electrons that will impinge upon the absorber, while the codes are written using a pencil beam. A minor discrepancy is expected to be observed in the experimental results and is currently under investigation by McCarthy. The results of this project supported the theory that the beta mass attenuation coefficient was accurately represented by the slope of an exponential function, but only for that particular region of the <b>transmission</b> <b>curve</b> that has a minimal absorber thickness. By fitting the data beyond 50 % of the beta particle range this theory does not hold true. The theory generated by McCarthy (1995) and the EGS 4 Monte Carlo code indicated that the <b>transmission</b> <b>curve</b> for a pencil beam was not accurately represented by an exponential function. The results of this experiment appeared to provide additional support to this assumption...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that useful {{information}} about the spectral distribution of an X-ray beam can be extracted by measuring and analyzing its <b>transmission</b> <b>curve.</b> This kind of approach to the characterization of the distribution in energy of photons is justified when the direct measurements of the energy of a single photon becomes too expensive or cannot just be performed. Thomson Scattering sources can produce up to 10 (8) photons within a pulse 10 ps long. Hence the rate of incidence of photons is too high to apply traditional X-ray spectroscopy methods while methods based on the <b>transmission</b> <b>curve</b> can still be used. In order to propose an application of these techniques in the characterization of a Thomson Scattering source we studied an iterative statistical algorithm (Expectation-Maximization) used as a regularization method on simulated measurement computed starting from a calculated energy distribution with peak energy of 20 keV. Results show that this method can give good approximations in the low energy range (approximately 20 keV) {{and that it is}} at least sensible to a small amount of radiation in the higher part of the energy range (approximately 70 keV). The robustness of the method against non-ideal experimental conditions is also considered. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
50|$|In practice, real <b>transmission</b> <b>curves</b> are {{not perfect}} and they {{typically}} have a shape {{similar to that}} of curve cR, which is normalized so that &tau; = 1 for &alpha; = 0.

40|$|Multilayered {{structures}} {{consisting of}} alternating negative-permittivity and dielectric layers are explored to obtain high-resolution imaging of subwavelength objects. The peaks {{with the smallest}} |ky| (ky is the transverse wave vector) on the <b>transmission</b> <b>curves,</b> which come from the guided modes of the multilayered structures, can not be completely damped by material loss. This makes the amplitudes of the evanescent waves around these peaks inappropriate after transmitted through the imaging structures, and the imaging quality is not good. To solve such a problem, the permittivity of the dielectric layers is appropriately chosen to make these sharp peaks merge with their neighboring peaks. Wide flat upheavals are then generated on the <b>transmission</b> <b>curves</b> so that evanescent waves in a large range are transmitted through the structures with appropriate amplitudes. In addition, {{it is found that}} the sharp peaks with the smallest |ky| can be eliminated by adding appropriate coating layers and wide flat upheavals can also be obtained.

40|$|In {{the paper}} we {{present the results}} of a modal {{analysis}} of the current distribution around the circumference of thin concentric rings arranged on both square and equilateral triangular lattices. The particular case of plane-wave illumination at 45 Â° incidence is considered owing to its relevance to oblique-incidence diplexer systems. Measured and predicted <b>transmission</b> <b>curves,</b> together with computer curves illustrating the frequency dependence of various current-mode amplitudes, are plotted for selected concentric-ring structures, each with the same mean radius for the outer ring, but with different inner-ring radii. The results relate individual current modes to features in the observed <b>transmission</b> <b>curves.</b> They confirm that the copolar transmission and lower reflection bands can be modelled with only one current mode in each ring. Crosspolar effects are discussed for incidence on the square lattice in the planes Â¿ = 0, 45 Â° and 90 Â°, where they are shown to be small for pure TE and TM...|$|R

Good correspondence with the measured signal gain is seen over many times the resonator bandwidth. We found that including the nonlinear damping parameter in the theory did not improve the quality of the fit.|$|E

The transmission intensity of ZnO/ZnTe core/shell nanowire arrays not only increases at 390 and 550 [*]nm but also increases gradually in other regions.

40|$|The {{spectral}} radiometric {{properties of}} various greenhouse cover materials (glass and seven plastic films) were {{measured in the}} laboratory using a spectroradiometer equipped with an integrating sphere. For the fluorescent material, the transmission was determined outdoors, under natural daylight. From the <b>transmission</b> <b>curves,</b> the parameters related to the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) transmission (τPAR, 400 - 700 nm) and the ratio ζ (red/far red irradiance) were calculated. It was observed that ζ was higher for the fluorescent material than for the classical films and lower for the shading coloured film, but their PAR transmissions were lower. The effective photosynthetic transmission (η) and quantum transmission (E) were determined by weighting the spectral <b>transmission</b> <b>curves</b> with, respectively, the photosynthetic and quantum yield efficiencies of an average plant. Only small {{differences were found between}} values of n and E for classical plastic materials and glass, but significant differences for the fluorescent and shading coloured films.
