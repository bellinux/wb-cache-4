5|$|Dennis Monroe Parker (Yaphet Kotto) is the Nostromo chief engineer; Brett is his assistant. On the ship, he incessantly demands {{bonuses for}} {{investigating}} the Derelicts distress beacon. After Dallas' fateful {{confrontation with the}} Alien, Parker investigates and finds the flamethrower left behind. When Ash attacks Ripley, Parker and Lambert save her and decapitate the android. After Ripley extracts the meaning of Ash's directive to allow the crew to die, Parker uses the flamethrower <b>to</b> <b>incinerate</b> his remains. He and Lambert are killed by the Alien when it ambushes them {{in their attempt to}} flee aboard the shuttle, with the Alien crushing Parker and finishing him off with a head bite.|$|E
5|$|Gunnery Sergeant Apone (Al Matthews) is {{the squad}} {{leader of the}} Colonial Marines sent to {{investigate}} LV-426. During the first incursion into the atmospheric processor, he enforces Gorman's orders not to use pulse rifle and smartgun ammunition. Shortly after finding a surviving, cocooned colonist whose chest bursts to reveal an Alien, Apone grabs a flamethrower from Frost <b>to</b> <b>incinerate</b> it. In the subsequent Alien attack, he is captured alive. Hudson later states that the life sign computer readouts indicate that Apone was not killed in the attack; presumably impregnated by an Alien, he died when the atmosphere processor exploded or from an Alien gestating in his body.|$|E

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarWithin {{the context}} of the project "Incineration of {{chemical}} waste" scenario-analyses are carried out for the quantity of chemical waste <b>to</b> be <b>incinerated</b> in the short term (1992) and in the longer term (2000). From this analyses it appears that the minimum quantity of waste <b>to</b> be <b>incinerated</b> in the year 1992 is calculated at about 160. 000 tons. For the year 2000 this is 200. 000 tons. The maximum quantities are calculated at 210. 000 tons (1992) and at 290. 000 tons (2000). These results should be used with reference to the used assumptions. To calculate a more reliable forecast of the chemical waste <b>to</b> be <b>incinerated</b> in the future a suitable registration and interpretation of chemical waste should take place...|$|R

25|$|Resistors {{with higher}} power ratings are {{physically}} larger and may require heat sinks. In a high-voltage circuit, attention must sometimes {{be paid to}} the rated maximum working voltage of the resistor.

25|$|Incineration {{is a waste}} {{treatment}} process that involves the combustion of organic substances contained in waste materials. This method also burns any organism to ash. It is used to sterilize medical and other biohazardous waste before it is discarded with non-hazardous waste. Bacteria incinerators are mini furnaces used <b>to</b> <b>incinerate</b> and kill off any micro organisms that may be on an inoculating loop or wire.|$|E

25|$|Another terror method {{involved}} deliberate random shelling of {{populated areas}} with 122-mm rockets. Areas victimized included Saigon, Danang {{and other major}} cities. At other times the Viet Cong eschewed the use of stand-off weapons and directly attacked villages and hamlets with the express intention of killing men, women and children to sow havoc, panic and insecurity. A 1968 attack on the hamlet of Son Tra in Quang Ngai province for example, used flamethrowers <b>to</b> <b>incinerate</b> 78 civilians, wounded many more, and destroyed most of the hamlet.|$|E
25|$|Extreme {{care must}} be taken in the {{management}} and disposal of sharps waste. The goal in sharps waste management is to safely handle all materials until they can be properly disposed. The final step in the disposal of sharps waste is to dispose of them in an autoclave.

Steps must be taken along the way to minimize the risk of injury from this material, while maximizing the amount of sharps material disposed.|$|E

25|$|AuCoin’s {{environmental}} record {{earned him}} the endorsement of major environmental organizations {{in each of his}} House elections. In addition to blocking offshore oil exploration, AuCoin prevented mining in the center of Oregon's Three Sisters Wilderness area by buying out a mining claim in the area’s geologically significant Rock Mesa and served on the committee that helped write the 200-mile offshore economic zone, which would become known as the Magnuson Act. Although the Port of Portland shipyards, a major Oregon employer, stood to benefit from oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, AuCoin opposed the plan on environmental grounds. He also helped preserve Cascade Head on the Oregon Coast, supported the Columbia Gorge Scenic Protection Act, helped stop the construction of Salt Caves Dam on the last free-flowing stretch of the Klamath River, co-authored the 1988 bill quadrupling the designation of National Wild and Scenic Rivers in Oregon, and fought the construction of a plant at the Umatilla Chemical Depot <b>to</b> <b>incinerate</b> excess chemical weapons.|$|E

25|$|According to Le Sage's theory, an {{isolated}} body {{is subjected to}} drag {{if it is in}} motion relative to the unique isotropic frame of the ultramundane flux (i.e., the frame in which the speed of the ultramundane corpuscles is the same in all directions). This {{is due to the fact}} that, if a body is in motion, the particles striking the body from the front have a higher speed (relative to the body) than those striking the body from behind - this effect will act to decrease the distance between the sun and the earth. The magnitude of this drag is proportional to vu, where v is the speed of the particles and u is the speed of the body, whereas the characteristic force of gravity is proportional to v2, so the ratio of drag to gravitational force is proportional to u/v. Thus for a given characteristic strength of gravity, the amount of drag for a given speed u can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the speed v of the ultramundane corpuscles. However, in order to reduce the drag to an acceptable level (i.e., consistent with observation) in terms of classical mechanics, the speed v must be many orders of magnitude greater than the speed of light. This makes Le Sage theory fundamentally incompatible with the modern science of mechanics based on special relativity, according to which no particle (or wave) can exceed the speed of light. In addition, even if superluminal particles were possible, the effective temperature of such a flux would be sufficient <b>to</b> <b>incinerate</b> all ordinary matter in a fraction of a second.|$|E
500|$|Health {{effects from}} the smog were downplayed in most early reports. Some {{hospitals}} reported increased admissions of patients with asthma.

The official told The New York Times that [...] "n not one [...] is a pattern emerging which would suggest {{we are dealing with}} an important health hazard as of this moment." [...] By this time, the inability <b>to</b> <b>incinerate</b> garbage had generated a large amount of excess waste.

40|$|The {{re-usability}} of Municipal Solid Waste Incinerator residues (MSWI residues) {{for building}} material is limited, because the leaching of some substances, including molybdenum, {{does not meet}} environmental standards.

The inventory of the uses of molybdenum in products, production processes and pathways to the MSWIs is based on information obtained from producers, trade-organisations, research institutes and the literature. The study shows that some potential sources of molybdenum in municipal solid waste do {{not contribute to the}} molybdenum load in MSWI input. These are plastics, dyes, toners, pigments, electronics, enamels, lubricants and fire retardants. The largest contribution to the MSWI input by municipal waste is the so-called fraction of residue waste. Sources of molybdenum in this fraction are bio-waste, ash and soil.

500|$|<b>To</b> <b>incinerate</b> bodies, {{there were}} large {{cremation}} pits constructed at Camp 3 within Treblinka II.

Built under the instructions of Herbert Floß, the camp's cremation expert, the pits consisted of railroad rails laid as grates on blocks of concrete. The bodies were placed on rails over wood, splashed with petrol, and burned. It was a harrowing sight, according to Jankiel Wiernik, with the bellies of pregnant women exploding from boiling amniotic fluid. He wrote that [...] "the heat radiating from the pits was maddening." [...] The bodies burned for five hours, without the ashing of bones. The pyres operated 24 hours a day. Once the system had been perfected, 10,000–12,000 bodies at a time could be incinerated.|$|E
