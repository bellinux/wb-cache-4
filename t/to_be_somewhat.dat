5|$|To {{create a}} sharp pattern, weavers usually end each pattern element at a {{particular}} thread, winding the coloured weft threads back around the same warps, leaving a narrow gap or slit. These are prized by collectors for the crispness of their decoration. The motifs on kilims woven in this way are constrained <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>somewhat</b> angular and geometric.|$|E
5|$|Hull Creek is a second-order stream. Its {{watershed}} {{is relatively}} narrow. In {{the upper reaches}} of the creek's watershed, residential areas are sparse and tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>somewhat</b> removed from the creek itself. In Blakely, it follows Pennsylvania Route 347 closely and crosses it several times. A gas line crosses the creek upstream of US Route 6. There are several patches of wetlands in the watershed's upper reaches, and two more in the middle and lower reaches. Upstream of Blakely, the watershed contains forested land and pastures on a rolling plateau.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Iskandar and {{his family}} members were not prosecuted for their past {{violations}} of the law on grounds that the royal immunity was still applicable when the incidences occurred. Nevertheless, shortly after the incident, Sultan Iskandar was prompted {{to take steps to}} rehabilitate his public image, which was more or less tarnished by the incident. In a public speech shortly after the episode, the Sultan was noted to have toned down somewhat on his hardline image and appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>somewhat</b> more humble, appealing to Johoreans to maintain their loyalty to him.|$|E

5|$|Water quality: It may be fair {{to presume}} that clean water is {{necessary}} to maintain essential habitat and a healthy population of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, {{just as it is}} to the survival of many other invertebrates; however, since Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is a terrestrial snail, the effects of water quality are expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>somewhat</b> indirect. While water quality may play a potential role in the success or decline of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, this relationship has not been clearly defined to date.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{pressure}} {{and heart rate}} {{are influenced by the}} vasomotor centre of the medulla, which causes arteries and veins <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>somewhat</b> constricted at rest. It does this by influencing the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems via the vagus nerve. Information about blood pressure is generated by baroreceptors in aortic bodies in the aortic arch, and passed to the brain along the afferent fibres of the vagus nerve. Information about the pressure changes in the carotid sinus comes from carotid bodies located near the carotid artery and this is passed via a nerve joining with the glossopharyngeal nerve. This information travels up to the solitary nucleus in the medulla. Signals from here influence the vasomotor centre to adjust vein and artery constriction accordingly.|$|E
5|$|In women, acne can be {{improved}} {{with the use of}} any combined birth control pill. These decrease the production of androgen hormones by the ovaries, resulting in lower skin production of sebum, and consequently reduce acne severity. Combinations containing third- or fourth-generation progestins such as desogestrel, drospirenone, or norgestimate are preferred for women with acne due to their stronger antiandrogenic effects. A 2014 review found that oral antibiotics appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>somewhat</b> more effective than birth control pills at decreasing the number of inflammatory acne lesions at three months. However, the two therapies are approximately equal in efficacy at six months for decreasing the number of inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total acne lesions. The authors of the analysis suggested that birth control pills may be a preferred first-line acne treatment, over oral antibiotics, in certain women due to similar efficacy at six months and a lack of associated antibiotic resistance.|$|E

5|$|Like most shooter games, first-person {{shooters}} involve an avatar, {{one or more}} ranged weapons, and a varying {{number of}} enemies. Because they {{take place in a}} 3D environment, these games tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>somewhat</b> more realistic than 2D shooter games, and have more accurate representations of gravity, lighting, sound and collisions. First-person shooters played on personal computers are most often controlled with a combination of a keyboard and mouse. This system has been claimed as superior to that found in console games, which frequently use two analog sticks: one used for running and sidestepping, the other for looking and aiming. It is common to display the character's hands and weaponry in the main view, with a head-up display showing health, ammunition and location details. Often, it is possible to overlay a map of the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|The {{lesser yellow-headed vulture}} flies solitarily, {{with wings}} held in a {{dihedral}} position. It glides at a low altitude over wetlands while locating food, and perches on fence posts or on other low perches. When flying, it travels alone and is rarely found in groups. The flight of the lesser yellow-headed {{is an example of}} static soaring flight, which uses thermals to maintain altitude without the need to flap its wings. This vulture rarely soars high in the air, preferring low altitudes. This bird is believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>somewhat</b> migratory in response to the changes in water level where it lives. The lesser yellow-headed vulture, like other New World vultures, has the unusual habit of urohidrosis, in which it urinates or defecates on its legs to cool them by evaporation.|$|E
5|$|The smooth, dextrinoid spores are in {{side view}} {{triangular}} with a spurred base, in frontal view oblong, and typically measure 5–9 by 3–4μm. Staining with Cresyl blue shows them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>somewhat</b> metachromatic, and binucleate. Cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are club-shaped to cylindric or sometimes spheropedunculate (somewhat spherical with a stem), and have dimensions of 20–44 by 6.5–13.5μm. Basidia are 18–30 by 5–8μm, mostly four-spored, and are absent on the gill edge. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are absent. The cap cuticle is a hymeniderm (lengthened cells arranged side by side) with mostly colorless elements of different lengths, measuring 16–62 by 8–18μm. The stipitipellis (outer covering of the stem) comprises a layer of colorless hyphae measuring about 2–3μm wide. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae of all parts of the fungus.|$|E

5|$|As {{the galactic}} plane passes through it, Serpens Cauda {{contains}} many massive OB stars. Several {{of these are}} {{visible to the naked}} eye, such as NW Serpentis, an early Be star that has been found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>somewhat</b> variable. The variability is interesting; according to one study, it {{could be one of the}} first discovered hybrids between Beta Cephei variables and slowly pulsating B stars. Although not visible to the naked eye, HD 167971 (MY Serpentis) is a Beta Lyrae variable triple system consisting of three very hot O-type stars. A member of the cluster NGC 6604, the two eclipsing stars are both blue giants, with one being of the very early spectral type O7.5III. The remaining star is either a blue giant or supergiant of a late O or early B spectral type. Also an eclipsing binary, the HD 166734 system consists of two O-type blue supergiants in orbit around each other. Less extreme in terms of mass and temperature is HD 161701, a spectroscopic binary consisting of a B-type primary and an Ap secondary, although it is the only known spectroscopic binary to consist of a star with excess of mercury and manganese and an Ap star.|$|E
5|$|Infectious {{particles}} possessing {{nucleic acid}} are dependent upon it to direct their continued replication. Prions, however, are infectious by {{their effect on}} normal versions of the protein. Sterilizing prions, therefore, requires the denaturation of the protein to a state in which the molecule is {{no longer able to}} induce the abnormal folding of normal proteins. In general, prions are quite resistant to proteases, heat, ionizing radiation, and formaldehyde treatments, although their infectivity can be reduced by such treatments. Effective prion decontamination relies upon protein hydrolysis or reduction or destruction of protein tertiary structure. Examples include sodium hypochlorite, sodium hydroxide, and strongly acidic detergents such as LpH. 134°C (274°F) for 18 minutes in a pressurized steam autoclave has been found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>somewhat</b> effective in deactivating the agent of disease. Ozone sterilization is currently being studied as a potential method for prion denaturation and deactivation. Renaturation of a completely denatured prion to infectious status has not yet been achieved; however, partially denatured prions can be renatured to an infective status under certain artificial conditions.|$|E
5|$|Owner Hugh Culverhouse, {{encouraged}} by recommendations from Vice President of Operations Ron Wolf and Alabama coaching legend Bear Bryant, chose John McKay, winner of four national championships with the USC Trojans, {{as the first}} Buccaneer head coach. Aided by a string of great tailbacks, including Heisman Trophy winners O. J. Simpson and Mike Garrett, McKay was credited with popularizing the I formation. Other candidates considered included Hank Stram, Ara Parseghian, and Joe Paterno. McKay was reportedly offered a five-year contract worth $750,000, plus cars, insurance, and real estate, and turned down an offer from the Seattle Seahawks and a counter-offer from USC to take the job. Critical of the NFL, he had turned down offers from professional teams in the past. McKay cited NCAA cutbacks in finances and recruiting as motivations for leaving the college ranks, saying simply that it was “time to try something else”. McKay’s only promise {{was that he would}} beat what he called “Pittsburgh’s timetable”, referencing the fact that it took the Steelers 41 years to win their first championship. Coach McKay would prove <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>somewhat</b> correct as Tampa Bay won the NFC's Central Division in 1979, the team's fourth year of existence, though it would take the team 27 seasons to win its first championship, which occurred in the 2002 season.|$|E

5|$|The main {{documentary}} {{source for}} the kings of the Crovan dynasty is the Chronicle of Mann, the only contemporary indigenous narrative-source concerning these men. The source itself survives {{in the form of}} a fourteenth-century Latin manuscript, which is in turn a copy of a chronicle probably first commissioned and composed during the reign of Magnús Óláfsson, King of Mann and the Isles (died 1265). About fifteen percent of the chronicle is devoted to the strife between the half-brothers, and much of the rest of this source deals with the after-effects of the conflict. Although the chronicle's account of the half-brothers' struggle appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>somewhat</b> neutral, its treatment of their descendants is clearly slanted in favour of Óláfr's sons. In fact, it was only during the reign of Óláfr's son Magnús, that the former's sons finally overcame Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson's descendants once and for all. The chronicle, therefore, may have been composed to further legitimise king's descended from Óláfr. In consequence, even the chronicle's claim that Óláfr's father had chosen him as his successor may be suspect. Whatever the case, the chronicle is the main historical {{source for the}} life of Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson.|$|E
5|$|The {{three species}} {{described}} by Peck were distinguished {{on the basis}} of physical features that were later found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>somewhat</b> overlapping. In terms of microscopic characters, spore sizes were not sufficiently different between them to be used as discriminating taxonomic characters. Subsequent investigators of North American mushroom flora had difficulties in interpreting Peck's concepts of these three taxa and in confirming their presence in their regional investigations. For example, McIlvaine (1902), Hard (1908), and McDougall (1925) reported (as variety or species) only C.ebulbosus. Bisby (1938), Christensen (1946), Smith (1958), and Groves (1962) mentioned only C.quadrifidus. Both Kauffman (1918) and Graham (1944) described C.ebulbosus and C.quadrifidus; Graham, however, only included C.quadrifidus in his key to his descriptions of Coprinus species. In 1979, W.Patrick published a comparative analysis of the three taxa from material collected by Peck, and, after concluding that the three were not sufficiently distinct to be considered separate species, reduced them to synonymy with Coprinopsis variegata, the earliest name.|$|E
