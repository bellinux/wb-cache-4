5|$|Coccothrinax is a genus of fan palms found {{throughout}} the Caribbean and in adjacent parts of southern Florida and Mexico. Most species are small to medium-sized, with maximum heights between 5 and 15 metres (17 and 49ft). Only one of the 53 species, C. readii, is absent from the insular Caribbean.

40|$|This study tested {{hypotheses}} that {{locus of}} causality attributions for {{the academic performance}} of <b>others</b> <b>are</b> influenced by whether <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> a specific individual, or a typical <b>other,</b> and whether <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> similar or dissimilar to self. The research was carried out in two studies. Study 1 entailed development of two scales to measure perceptions of interpersonal similarity: 254 Australian undergraduates rated their similarity to either a specific other or to typical other students. In Study 2, 332 subjects completed one of the 16 -item scales developed in Study 1, along with Rosenberg 2 ̆ 7 s self-esteem scale, and self-attribution and other-attribution versions of the Multidimensional Multi-attribution Causation Scale (MMCS). Results showed that attributions for {{the academic performance of}} <b>others</b> <b>were</b> strongly affected by whether <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> perceived to be similar or dissimilar to self, especially when <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> a specific individual. In particular, causal attributions for similar specific <b>others</b> <b>were</b> more favourable than attributions for self...|$|R
50|$|Derrida {{proposed}} that the absolute alterity of <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>is</b> compromised because <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>is</b> <b>other</b> than <b>the</b> Self and the group. That logical problem has especially negative consequences {{in the realm of}} human geography when <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> person <b>is</b> denied ethical priority in geopolitical discourse. Hence, the use of the language of Otherness in the anthropological discourse (Oriental Studies) about Western encounters with non-Western cultures preserves the dominantor-dominated discourse of hegemony, just as misrepresenting <b>the</b> feminine as <b>Other</b> reasserts male privilege as primary in social discourse.|$|R

Napoca Cable Network is available through cable, and broadcasts local content throughout the day. Other stations work as affiliates of national TV stations, only providing the audience with local reports {{in addition to the}} national programming. This situation is mirrored in the radio broadcasting companies: except for Radio Cluj, Radio Impuls and the Hungarian-language Paprika Rádió, all other stations are local affiliates of the national broadcasters. Casa Radio, situated on Donath Street, is one of the modern landmarks of the media and communications industry; it is, however, not the only one: Palatul Telefoanelor ("the telephone palace") is also a major modernist symbol of communications in the city centre.|$|E

5|$|Beeston {{was built}} by Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, as an impregnable stronghold and a symbol of power. The siting of the castle's outer bailey walls was chosen to take {{advantage}} of the fortifications remaining from the earlier Iron Age rampart. In medieval documents the castle is described as Castellum de Rupe, the Castle on the Rock. It is one of three major castles built by Ranulph in the 1220s, shortly after his return from the Fifth Crusade. <b>The</b> <b>others</b> <b>are</b> Bolingbroke in Lincolnshire, and Chartley, Staffordshire, both of which share similar architectural features with Beeston; in particular the design of the towers.|$|E
5|$|Following the charmed ring, Sophie passes into a {{scene from}} the past. She watched a young Howl take pity on a falling star—Calcifer—and give it his heart. The act bound Calcifer to Howl indefinitely; however, by losing his heart, Howl was emotionally trapped in adolescence. Sophie finds Howl in bird form, and takes him back to Calcifer. The witch returns Howl's heart, and Sophie places it back inside Howl, {{returning}} him to life and freeing Calcifer. Howl wakes up and Sophie embraces him. Although Calcifer is now free, he returns to his former company. Suliman, watching through a crystal globe, decides to end the war.
