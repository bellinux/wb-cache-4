5|$|Chazz Palminteri as U.S. Customs Special Agent Dave Kujan. Singer {{had always}} wanted the actor for the film, {{but he was always}} unavailable. The role was offered to Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro, both of whom turned it down. The filmmakers even had Al Pacino come in and read for the part, but he decided not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> he had just played a cop in Heat. Palminteri became available, but only for a week. When he signed on, this persuaded the film's {{financial}} backers to support the film fully because he was a sufficiently high-profile star, thanks to the recent release of A Bronx Tale and Bullets Over Broadway.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, Pillai is released. He brings {{news that}} Jackson has been {{transferred}} back to England on Davison's recommendation. At Kattabomman's court, a British messenger sent by Colonel Ooshington, Tirunelveli's new collector, reports that Pillai {{and his men}} have looted their granaries and killed their men at Srivaikuntam. Pillai justifies his act, saying that he instructed his men <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> of the famine conditions prevalent in their kingdom. Ashamed of Pillai's act, Kattabomman accuses him of injustice. Pillai apologises and offers himself as a prisoner to the British, but Kattabomman refuses to hand him over; instead he offers money to the British as compensation for the looted rice. Ooshington does not agree and, with Major Bannerman's and Ettappan's help, incites the neighbouring rulers to attack Kattabomman. Bannerman is placed {{in charge of the}} British troops. He and Ettappan plan to attack Panchalankurichi when the people are away attending a festival in Tiruchendur. Kattabomman's spy Sunderalingam, overhears this and informs him; he prepares for battle.|$|E

500|$|Sophie Grace Chappell argues that, without {{external}} reasons for action, it becomes impossible {{to maintain that}} {{the same set of}} moral reasons applies to all agents equally. In cases where someone has no internal reason to do what others see as the right thing, they cannot be blamed for failing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> internal reasons are the only reasons, and blame, Williams wrote, [...] "involves treating the person who is blamed like someone who had a reason {{to do the right thing}} but did not do it." ...|$|E
500|$|A fan of Fringe, Pearl Jam {{musician}} Mike McCready {{talked with}} series composer Chris Tilton about writing some music for [...] "Northwest Passage". McCready said he started [...] "throwing ideas back and forth. And I {{think they just}} wanted a northwest guy <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> they were shooting it in the northwest". He elaborated that [...] "My role was smaller than someone who wrote all the music for it, but I think I was none the less integral in there. I mean, it was fun. Chris sent me his cues, and I just kind of rearranged them into guitar ideas".|$|E

500|$|The {{execution}} of Saddam Hussein, which Anwar had filmed {{from the internet}} from start to finish, was excluded from the documentary. [...] "We had a big debate {{about whether or not}} that should go into the film", O'Connor explained. Water continued, [...] "it {{was one of those things}} where to see it, it just gets you. But we had to ask ourselves, does it help our story? No." [...] Footage that was nearly edited out included a scene where Anwar had to siphon petrol out of the family car for the house's generator. Anwar explained to the camera that he needed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> their family was so poor. [...] "That's tough", commented Water, [...] "because that's a dishonour to his family." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music for}} Sonic the Hedgehog was {{composed}} by Masato Nakamura, bassist and songwriter of the J-pop band Dreams Come True. Nakamura {{stated that he}} was surprised when asked to create the soundtrack for Sonic the Hedgehog, as he had just started with Dreams Come True. He wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> Sega said the game {{was going to be}} better than Mario, and was inspired by the team's desire to outperform Nintendo. He adapted the Genesis' sound chip, and believed the hardest part of creating the soundtrack was the number of sounds that could play concurrently: he was limited to four, and said that his lack of knowledge of music on computers made it [...] "impossible". Nakamura wrote the soundtrack concurrently with [...] "Million Kisses", a studio album for Dreams Come True.|$|E
500|$|Each night {{following}} the shows, the musicians and Dowd would [...] "grab some beers and sandwiches" [...] {{and head to}} Manhattan's Atlantic Studios {{to go over the}} performances. Set lists for following shows were crafted by listening to the recordings and going over what they could keep and what they would need to capture once more. [...] "We wanted to give ourselves plenty of times <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> we didn't {{want to go back and}} overdub anything, because then it wouldn't have been a real live album," [...] said Gregg Allman, and in the end, the band only edited out Doucette's harmonica when it didn't fit. [...] "That was our pinnacle," [...] said Dickey Betts later. [...] "The Fillmore days are definitely the most cherished memories that I have.

5000|$|Late Night with Jimmy Fallon {{dedicated}} {{the entire}} show on January 14, 2014, to Springsteen {{and the new}} album. Springsteen and Fallon, who were dressed as Springsteen from the Born in the U.S.A. era, performed a parody song titled [...] "Gov. Christie Traffic Jam" [...] set {{to the tune of}} [...] "Born to Run". The parody poked fun at the Fort Lee lane closure scandal. Fallon said he warned Christie about the skit prior <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> he knew <b>it</b> could possibly sting a bit. The E Street Band (with Patti Scialfa and minus Van Zandt, who was again filming Lilyhammer), along with Tom Morello, joined Springsteen throughout the show for performances of three songs from the new album. Fallon also interviewed Springsteen.|$|R

500|$|According to Mulligan, {{a problem}} during the {{production}} {{was that her}} role required her to drive: {{at the time she}} {{did not know how to}} drive or have a driver's licence. She did a two-week intensive course to learn how to work a manual gear change so she could eventually film the driving scenes, but failed the driving test. [...] "Iâ€™m really bad at it", she explained. [...] " [...] no hand and eye coordination." [...] The production team ultimately had to shoot the scene on a private road, where she was allowed to get behind the wheel. The director had a hard time making Knightley look plain in the film. He tells in an interview: [...] "It was difficult. She was eager and happy <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> the role called for it. But even at her worst, Keira still looks astonishing".|$|E
500|$|Asked in February 2017 {{if there}} would be more Audioslave reunion shows in the future, Cornell replied, [...] "It's always a possibility. I mean, we've been talking about it for at least three or four years now. We were talking about {{actually}} picking dates, and it just ended up not working out because everybody's so busy. They have another band again, they all have separate bands that they do themselves, I have Soundgarden and a solo career that's taking up a lot of time, and I just did Temple of the Dog. So, it's really honestly as simple as we end up having a window of time where it's comfortable for everybody and we want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> I definitely feel like everybody's up for it." [...] On May 18, 2017, Cornell was found dead in his hotel room in Detroit after performing at a show with Soundgarden, ending the possibility of a reunion.|$|E
500|$|A {{key element}} of Simpson's {{promotion}} was The Ashlee Simpson Show, which debuted on June 16, 2004, and ran for eight episodes, achieving high ratings for cable television. Jessica's reality show, , had debuted in 2003 and had proved highly successful, being credited with reviving her flagging music career; reality television proved similarly effective in helping launch Simpson's music career. It {{has been said that}} Simpson's father and manager Joe Simpson [...] "redefined how you sell records" [...] through his use of reality television to promote his daughters. Simpson said that she initially did not want to do the reality show but that her father persuaded her <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> it would be about the production of her album: [...] "...I thought that was kind of cool. You're actually seeing a deeper look into how this album got made." [...] She also thought the show, by showcasing her own personality, would help to distinguish her from Jessica.|$|E

500|$|British pop {{and soul}} singer JahmÃ©ne Douglas {{released}} a cover version of [...] "Titanium" [...] on July 22, 2013 {{as the lead}} single from his debut studio album, Love Never Fails (2013). Douglas' version peaked at number 94 on the UK Singles Chart. Talking to Digital Spy, Douglas said: [...] "It's very hard to sing. I was scared <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> it's a big chart song and I'm quite old school. For me, the song is about strength and the music video is based around domestic violence and how a woman gets out of it. The lyrics are so powerful for that interpretation. Hopefully if someone is in that situation and watches it, they'll think, I can get out." [...] A music video to accompany the release of [...] "Titanium" [...] was first released onto YouTube on June 12, 2013 at a total length of three minutes and fifty-four seconds. The music video shows Douglas next to a piano, while a story of domestic abuse plays out.|$|E
500|$|We {{disliked the}} English {{language}} in the past. I disliked it because I was forced to learn Shakespeare and Milton, for which I had no taste at all. If {{we are going to}} be compelled to learn Hindi, I would perhaps not be able to learn it because of my age, and perhaps I would not be willing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> of the amount of constraint you put on me. This kind of intolerance makes us fear that the strong Centre which we need, a strong Centre which is necessary will also mean the enslavement of people who do not speak the language at the centre. I would, Sir, convey a warning on behalf of people of the South for the reason that there are already elements in South India who want separation..., and my honourable friends in U.P. do not help us in any way by flogging their idea of [...] "Hindi Imperialism" [...] to the maximum extent possible.

500|$|In {{the same}} interview, Rihanna {{explained}} why {{she liked to}} collaborate with Minaj, saying [...] "She has a great buzz {{and she has a}} 'thing' to her. She is a star and that's why people love her. She's also really entertaining with her visual as well as her lyrics, and she has a great melody." [...] The singer continued to reveal how she was impressed with Minaj's songwriting abilities, saying [...] "I'm really amazed that she can write like that. [...] not only raps but she can write songs too... It was really easy actually. We were going back and forth with the texts on how {{we were going to get}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> we were in two different places and had two opposite schedules." [...] In an interview with DJ Semtex for BBC Radio, Minaj explained how the concept for her rap verse developed, revealing [...] "I just wanted to be crazy, I wrote that track in bed actually. I had an off day, they sent me a record and said they needed it back in 24 hours and I wrote." [...] With regard to the original, [...] "It's Raining Men", Minaj stated that she wanted to make [...] "Raining Men" [...] "more melodic and crazy." [...] "Raining Men" [...] was sent for urban radio adds as the third single from Loud on December 7, 2010. On January 25, 2011, the song was re-released for urban radio adds.|$|E

500|$|When Mirkin {{took over}} as show runner, he listed actor James Woods {{as one of the}} people he would most like to guest star on the show. Michael Caine was {{originally}} supposed to be the actor in the episode who takes over Apu's job at the Kwik-E-Mart, but he rejected the role. The story was therefore rewritten so that Woods received Apu's job instead. Woods was one of animation director David Silverman's favorite guest stars. Mirkin said he provided one of the [...] "most fantastic" [...] performances ever on the show, and commented that he [...] "nailed" [...] all of his lines and was [...] "so funny, right {{at the top of his}} head". Mirkin said that when most guest stars come in to record their lines for the show, they are a little nervous because they have never done voice-over before. Mirkin noted, however, that Woods was a [...] "fearless guy" [...] and he was [...] "so excited <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> he was a huge fan of the show". Silverman noted that in addition to his humorous ad-libbing, Woods's tendency to hesitate while speaking was [...] "great for animation", explaining that it made the character feel more realistic. [...] "Homer and Apu" [...] features the popular Simpsons song [...] "Who Needs The Kwik-E-Mart?", sung by Apu and the Simpson family. The song was written by all of the show's writers in the writer's room, and it was composed by Alf Clausen. The song later appeared on the soundtrack album Songs in the Key of Springfield, which was released on March 18, 1997, and compiled many musical numbers from the show.|$|E

His father is killed not long after and at that moment, he vows to seek justice. At night, he becomes a devil-modeled vigilante who takes justice into his hands. Affleck was cast in October 2001. Vin Diesel was considered to portray Daredevil before him, but he opted to take a role in another film. In a February 2011 interview, Guy Pearce said that he was offered the role but turned it down, stating that [...] "comic-strip stuff isnâ€™t really my cup of tea, really." [...] Matt Damon also revealed that he was offered the role. [...] He claimed that he and Ben [...] "loved that comic book but I just didn't quite believe in the script or the director at the time." [...] Colin Farrell was also considered until Affleck signed. As a fan, Affleck made sure he had read every single issue of Daredevil, commenting that it was about taking what he knew as a fan and faithfully getting it on the screen. Joe Quesada considered it [...] "serendipity in action" [...] that Affleck is the lead role, as when he and Kevin Smith did the [...] series, they had modeled it on Affleck. Affleck said Daredevil was his favorite comic book as a kid, and explained why he took the role by saying [...] "Everybody has that one thing from childhood that they remember and that sticks with them. This story was that for me." [...] Additionally, he said, [...] "I didn't want someone else <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> I was afraid that they would go out and do it different from the comic and screw it up." ...|$|E
