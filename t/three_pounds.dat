5|$|Although Douglas {{had been}} {{the cause of his}} misfortunes, he and Wilde were reunited in August 1897 at Rouen. This meeting was disapproved of by the friends and {{families}} of both men. Constance Wilde was already refusing to meet Wilde or allow him to see their sons, though she sent him money – a meagre <b>three</b> <b>pounds</b> a week. During the latter part of 1897, Wilde and Douglas lived together near Naples for a few months until they were separated by their families under the threat of cutting off all funds.|$|E

On his final start of the year he won at Newmarket for the third time when taking the Jockey Club Cup.|$|E

She later transferred to public school where teachers' aides helped her keep up in class.|$|E
5|$|Silkies are {{considered}} a bantam breed in some countries, but this varies according to region and many breed standards class them officially as large fowl; the bantam Silkie is actually a separate variety most of the time. Almost all North American strains of the breed are bantam-sized, but in Europe the standard-sized is the original version. However, even standard Silkies are relatively small chickens, with the males weighing only four pounds (1.8kg), and females weighing <b>three</b> <b>pounds</b> (1.36kg). The American Standard of Perfection calls for males that are 36 ounces (1kg), and females that are 32 ounces (910grams).|$|E

Traditionally {{they were made}} from bronze but due to the disruption and loss of trade routes between the islands of Borneo and Mindanao during World War II, resulting in loss of access to necessary metal ores, and the subsequent post-war use of scrap metal, brass gongs with shorter decaying tones are now commonplace.|$|E

5|$|During {{the latter}} part of the reign of Edward IV, Richard {{demonstrated}} his loyalty, in contrast to their brother George, who had allied himself with Warwick through the 1460s, and threw in his lot with the earl when the latter rebelled at the end of the decade. Following Warwick's 1470 rebellion, in which he made peace with Margaret of Anjou and promised the restoration of Henry VI to the English throne, Richard, William, Lord Hastings and Anthony Woodville, Earl Rivers escaped capture at Doncaster by Warwick's brother, Lord Montague. On 2 October they sailed from King's Lynn in two ships; Edward landed at Marsdiep and Richard at Zeeland. It was said that, having left England in such haste as to possess almost nothing, Edward was forced to pay their passage with his fur cloak; certainly Richard borrowed <b>three</b> <b>pounds</b> from Zeeland's town-bailiff. They were attainted by Warwick's only Parliament on 26 November. They resided in Bruges with Louis de Gruthuse, who had been the Burgundian Ambassador to Edward's court, but it was not until Louis XI of France declared war on Burgundy that Charles, Duke of Burgundy, assisted their return, providing, along with the Hanseatic merchants, £20,000, 36 ships and 1200 men. They departed Flushing for England on 11 March 1471. Warwick's arrest of local sympathisers prevented them from landing in Yorkist East Anglia and on 14 March, after being separated in a storm, their ships ran ashore at Holderness. The town of Hull refused him entry, and Edward gained entry to York by using the same claim as Henry of Bolingbroke had before deposing Richard II in 1399; that is, that he was merely reclaiming the Dukedom of York rather than the crown. It was in Edward's attempt to regain his throne that Gloucester began to demonstrate his skill as a military commander.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{method for}} producing century eggs {{is the development}} and improvement from the aforementioned primitive process. Instead of using just clay, a mixture of wood ash, calcium oxide, and salt {{is included in the}} plastering mixture, thereby increasing its pH and sodium content. The addition of calcium oxide and wood ash to the mixture lowers the risk of spoilage and also increases the speed of the aforementioned primitive process. A recipe for creating century eggs through this process starts with the infusion of <b>three</b> <b>pounds</b> of tea in boiling water. To the tea, <b>three</b> <b>pounds</b> of calcium oxide (or seven pounds when the operation is performed in winter), nine pounds of sea salt, and seven pounds of ash from burned oak is mixed into a smooth paste. While wearing gloves to prevent the chemicals from burning the skin, each egg is individually covered by hand, then rolled in a mass of rice chaff to keep the eggs from adhering to one another before they are placed in cloth-covered jars or tightly woven baskets. The mud slowly dries and hardens into a crust over several months, and then the eggs are ready for consumption.|$|E
25|$|During Admiralty {{surveys of}} the north west coast in 1840, crew from HMS Beagle {{discovered}} a brass gun of about <b>three</b> <b>pounds</b> calibre, an iron swivel on which paint still adhered as well as numerous other artefacts signifying European occupation, on the largest island in the Pelsart Group. The commander, John Clements Wickham, named the place Gun Island and the passage between the Easter and Pelsart Groups, Zeewijk Channel. Later during the 19th century many islets were used by men collecting guano.|$|E

Daria was born prematurely in Washington, DC, weighing <b>three</b> <b>pounds,</b> two ounces (1.42kg) and requiring a total blood transfusion. The rubella caused congenital damage: Daria was deaf, partially blind with cataracts, and severely mentally disabled. She was institutionalized {{for much of}} her life.

25|$|A {{terrorist}} attack was foiled on 18 April 1986 in {{what became known}} as the Hindawi Affair. A pregnant Irishwoman named Anne-Marie Murphy was about to board an El Al flight at London's Heathrow airport when her bag was found to contain <b>three</b> <b>pounds</b> of plastic explosives. These had been planted by her fiancé Nezar Hindawi, who was booked on a different flight. Hindawi was jailed for 45 years, the longest sentence (short of a life setence) ever delivered by a British court. There was evidence that Syrian officials were involved and as a result, Britain cut off diplomatic relations with Syria.|$|E

Shapiro also {{observed}} an empty P2P bottle at the house. Two days later, he returned with 100 g of P2P. While he mostly watched as the trio made their meth, at one point, according to later court testimony, he and Russell helped pick up some pieces of dropped aluminum foil and put it into a flask. Patrick Connolly finished the rest of the process, and Shapiro stopped by the next morning to pick up his half of the meth. He also bought a portion of the remainder for $60.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} definite recorded {{performance of}} Titus was on 24 January 1594, when Philip Henslowe noted {{a performance by}} Sussex's Men of Titus & ondronicus. Although Henslowe doesn't specify a theatre, it was most likely The Rose. Repeated performances were staged on 28 January and 6 February. On 5 and 12 June, Henslowe recorded two further performances of the play, at the Newington Butts Theatre by the combined Admiral's Men and Lord Chamberlain's Men. The 24 January show earned <b>three</b> <b>pounds</b> eight shillings, and the performances on 29 January and 6 February earned two pounds each, making it the most profitable play of the season. The next recorded performance was on 1 January 1596, when a troupe of London actors, possibly Chamberlain's Men, performed the play during the Christmas festivities at Burley-on-the-Hill in the manor of Sir John Harington, Baron of Exton.|$|E

25|$|The American $100 {{bill has}} some competition, {{primarily}} from the €500 note. The larger value of the banknote {{makes it easier to}} transport larger amounts of money. As an example, $1 million in currency in $100 bills weighs 22 pounds, if, say, you were to carry it on board an airplane. It is difficult to carry this much money without a briefcase and some physical security. The same amount in €500 notes would weigh less than <b>three</b> <b>pounds,</b> and it could probably be dispersed in clothing and in luggage without attracting attention or alerting a security device. For many illegal operations, the problem of transporting currency is more difficult than transporting cocaine because of the size and weight of the currency. The ease of transporting banknotes makes the euro very attractive to Latin American drug cartels.|$|E

Singsen (1951) believed that today's birds are growing on the margin of safety provided in earlier nutrient recommendations. One of the nutrient recommendations of the National Re-search Council believed by Singsen (1951) to be critical is for the mineral phosphorus which {{has been the subject of}} the present investigation.
