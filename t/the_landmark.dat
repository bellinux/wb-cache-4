40|$|Rats were {{required}} in three experiments {{to find one}} of two submerged platforms that were situated in the same pair of diagonally opposite corners of a rectangular grey swimming pool. The experimental groups were trained with landmarks, comprising A 4 cards attached to the walls, located in the corners containing the platforms. For the control groups, <b>the</b> <b>landmarks</b> were situated in the corners containing the platforms for half of the trials, {{and in the other}} corners for the remaining trials. Learning about the positions of the platforms with reference to the shape of the pool was overshadowed in the experimental groups when <b>the</b> <b>landmarks</b> were white, and enhanced when <b>the</b> <b>landmarks</b> were black. A fourth experiment assessed whether geometric cues influenced the control acquired by <b>the</b> <b>landmarks.</b> As in <b>the</b> previous experiments, the presence of the geometric cues overshadowed learning about <b>the</b> <b>landmarks</b> when they were white, but enhanced learning when <b>the</b> <b>landmarks</b> were black...|$|R

Increase the radius successively, such as 2 and 3  km, and the radius must be smaller than the deviation.
