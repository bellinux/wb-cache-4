Despite what had been claimed in the media, the proposal did not necessarily leave the Solar System with only twelve planets. Mike Brown, the discoverer of Sedna and Eris, has said that at least 53 known bodies in the Solar System probably fit the definition, and that a complete survey would probably reveal more than 200.|$|E

5|$|Article One {{came within}} one {{state of the}} number needed to become adopted into the Constitution on two {{occasions}} between 1789 and 1803. Despite coming close to ratification early on, it has never received the approval of enough states {{to become part of}} the Constitution. As Congress did not attach a ratification time limit to the article, it is still technically pending before the states. Since no state has approved it since 1792, ratification by an additional 27 states would now be necessary for the article <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>adopted.</b>|$|E

The French Dewoitine D.520 and Germany's Messerschmitt Bf 109, for example, were designed to take advantage of new techniques of monocoque construction and the availability of new high-powered, liquid-cooled, in-line aero engines. They also featured refinements such as retractable undercarriages, fully enclosed cockpits, low drag and all-metal wings (all introduced on civil airliners years before but slow <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>adopted</b> by the military, who favoured the biplane's simplicity and manoeuvrability).|$|E

It is permitted in the United States but is not mandatory if safety can be ascertained by other methods, and the test species is not specified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). When testing toxicity of food additives, food contaminants, and some drugs and chemicals the FDA uses beagles and miniature pigs as surrogates for direct human testing.

Due to its controversial and revealing design, the bikini was slow <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>adopted.</b> In many countries it was banned from beaches and public places.

5|$|A more {{elaborate}} style known as decorated Gothic, applying ornamentation to vaults and pillars, particularly using curved motifs, began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>adopted</b> in {{the thirteenth century}} and was characteristic of Scottish church building in the fourteenth century. It was used at Dunblane Cathedral, built {{in the thirteenth century}}, particularly to decorate the nave and East end. At Fortrose in the Highlands the elaborate decoration of this style is still visible in the south aisle. One of the finest examples is Sweetheart Abbey near Dumfries, a Cistercian monastery, named after the burial of John de Balliol's heart alongside the body of his wife. The period of the Wars of Independence (1296–1357) saw a large number of ecclesiastical buildings ruined, including Melrose and Jedburgh Abbeys. Church building was largely confined to the parish churches in the relatively secure areas like Fife, as at St. Monans, originally a church of the Dominican friars.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{served only}} {{five months in}} the office before the Conservatives were {{defeated}} in the 1923 general election. Ramsay MacDonald became the first Labour Prime Minister, but the Labour government fell within months, necessitating another general election. By a margin of only 77 votes, Chamberlain narrowly defeated Labour candidate Oswald Mosley (who later led the British Union of Fascists). Believing he would lose if he stood again in Ladywood, Chamberlain arranged <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>adopted</b> for Birmingham Edgbaston, the district of the city {{where he was born}} and which was a much safer seat which he would hold {{for the rest of his}} life. The Unionists won the election, but Chamberlain declined to serve again as Chancellor, preferring his former position as Minister of Health.|$|E
5|$|Chinese Ming style {{clothing}} was forced on Vietnamese {{people by the}} Nguyễn dynasty. The tunics and trouser clothing of the Han Chinese on the Ming and Qing tradition was worn by the Vietnamese. However, Han-Chinese clothing is assembled by several pieces of clothing including both pants and skirts called Qun (裙) or chang (裳) which {{is a part of}} Hanfu garments throughout the history of Han Chinese clothing. The Ao Dai was created when tucks which were close fitting and compact were added in the 1920s to this Chinese style. The Chinese clothing in the form of trousers and tunic were mandated by the Vietnamese Nguyen government. It was up to the 1920s in Vietnam's north area in isolated hamlets where skirts were worn. The Chinese Ming dynasty, Tang dynasty, and Han dynasty {{clothing was}} referred <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>adopted</b> by Vietnamese military and bureaucrats by the Nguyen Lord Nguyễn Phúc Khoát (Nguyen The Tong). Chinese clothing started influencing Vietnamese dress in the Ly dynasty. The current Ao Dai was introduced by the Nguyen Lords.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, Middle Scots, often simply called English, became the {{dominant}} {{language of the}} country. It was derived largely from Old English, {{with the addition of}} elements from Gaelic and French. Although resembling the language spoken in northern England, it became a distinct dialect from the late fourteenth century onwards. It began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>adopted</b> by the ruling elite as they gradually abandoned French. By the fifteenth century it was the language of government, with acts of parliament, council records and treasurer's accounts almost all using it from the reign of James I onwards. As a result, Gaelic, once dominant north of the Tay, began a steady decline. Lowland writers began to treat Gaelic as a second class, rustic and even amusing language, helping to frame attitudes towards the highlands and to create a cultural gulf with the lowlands.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{influence}} beyond Hadrian's Wall {{does not}} appear to have had a major impact on settlement patterns, with Iron Age hill forts and promontory forts continuing to be occupied through the early Medieval period. These often had defences of dry stone or timber laced walls, sometimes with a palisade. The large numbers of these forts has been taken to suggest peripatetic monarchies and aristocracies, moving around their domains to control and administer them. In the Northern and Western Isles the sites of Iron Age Brochs and wheel houses continued to be occupied, but were gradually replaced with less imposing cellular houses. There are a handful of major timber halls in the south, comparable to those excavated in Anglo-Saxon England and dated to the 7th century. In the areas of Scandinavian settlement in the islands and along the coast a lack of timber meant that native materials had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>adopted</b> for house building, often combining layers of stone with turf.|$|E
5|$|The {{subjective}} test was rejected {{for several reasons}} by the Court of Appeal. It held that applying the {{subjective test}} to sections 8 and 10 of the ISA would render the provisions unconstitutional. The word law in Article 12(1) of the Constitution was held in Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor (1980) to encompass fundamental rules of natural justice. Hence, Parliament cannot pass legislation which authorizes the executive to exercise power in breach of these fundamental rules or to exercise power in an arbitrary manner. If the subjective test were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>adopted,</b> it would in effect allow the executive to exercise arbitrary powers of detention, therefore rendering sections8 and 10 of the ISA inconsistent with Article12(1). When the case was decided, Article149(1) of the Constitution, which protects the validity of anti-subversion laws notwithstanding inconsistencies with specified fundamental liberties, did not cover inconsistencies with Article12. Also, the Court noted that adopting the objective test {{would be consistent with}} Article93 of the Constitution, which vests judicial power in the courts. It did not, however, directly address the argument by counsel that the subjective test, in conferring arbitrary powers of detention, would be inconsistent with Article93.|$|E
