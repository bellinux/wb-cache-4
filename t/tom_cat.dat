2500|$|As {{the tide}} was {{receding}} and nightfall was coming, the naval vessels withdrew. [...] Capt. Drayton attempted to prevent repair of the earthworks overnight by maintaining 13" [...] mortar fire on the fort overnight. [...] This prevented slave labor from conducting the repair, {{but it did not}} prevent Confederate soldiers from working. [...] The damage had been repaired by the next afternoon, and the loss of the fort's mascot, <b>Tom</b> <b>Cat,</b> reported to General Beauregard.|$|E
2500|$|After this introduction, Fritti Tailchaser, a young ginger <b>tom</b> <b>cat,</b> {{sets out}} to stray from his home and clan, the Meeting Wall Clan, {{in search of his}} friend Hushpad after strange disappearances of other cats have been reported. The kitten Pouncequick follows him, and {{eventually}} catches up. Together, they set out on a long journey to visit the feline royal Court of Harar, with the intention of resolving the mystery of the disappearances. They meet a rather crazy cat named Eatbugs, who travels with them for parts of the journey to the court. [...] Soon they run into some Firstwalkers, cats who live in the wild, who are of a direct bloodline from Goldeneye and Skydancer. Their thane (leader), Quiverclaw, challenges Tailchaser ceremonially and is impressed enough to allow him and Pouncequick to accompany them for a time. Soon, they must part ways.|$|E

2500|$|Cartoons {{and short}} {{subjects}} were a major {{sign of the}} times, as Warner Brothers Studios and Disney Studios gave unprecedented aid {{to the war effort}} by creating cartoons that were both patriotic and humorous, and also contributed to remind movie-goers of wartime activities such as rationing and scrap drives, war bond purchases, and the creation of victory gardens. Warner shorts such as Daffy - The Commando, Draftee Daffy, Herr Meets Hare, and Russian Rhapsody are particularly remembered for their biting wit and unflinching mockery of the enemy (particularly Adolf Hitler, Hideki Tōjō, and Hermann Göring). Their cartoons of Private Snafu, produced for the military as [...] "training films", served to remind many military men of the importance of following proper procedure during wartime, for their own safety. Hanna Barbara also contributed to the war effort with slyly pro US short cartoon The Yankee Doodle Mouse with [...] "Lt." [...] Jerry Mouse as the hero and <b>Tom</b> <b>Cat</b> as the [...] "enemy".|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{determine}} if an underlying biological cause exists for the exuberant reproductive success in free-roaming unowned (FRU) cats. The hypothesis for this thesis was that FRU <b>tom</b> and queen <b>cats</b> have reproductively adapted to man-made sterilization efforts by lowering the age at which they enter puberty. For domestic cats, puberty is reported to occur around 8 months of age. Cats were presented for surgical sterilization at either a feral cat clinic or at a local Humane Society during August-October 2014 and 2015. Age was determined by records provided from feral cat colony managers and confirmed with dental eruption patterns. The age groups for <b>tom</b> <b>cats</b> were: 2 - 2. 5 months (weanling; n= 6), 3 - 4 months (juvenile; n= 6), 5 - 6 months (pubertal; n= 6), and 12 - 24 months (adult; n= 6). Queens were grouped by age (< 4 months (pet n= 5, FRU n= 10) and 4 - 6 months (pet n= 2, FRU n= 7)). For <b>tom</b> <b>cats,</b> the penis was evaluated to determine if spines were present and the contents from both vasa deferentes were milked onto a microscope slide, mixed with eosin-nigrosin stain, spread with a spreader slide, allowed to air dry and evaluated at 1000 X. The percentage of sperm with normal morphology was determined after evaluating 100 sperm/slide. Testicles were hemi-sectioned, formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded, cut into sections (6 µm), stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and evaluated at 200 X for evidence of spermatogenesis and measurement of seminiferous tubule diameter. For queens, the total ovarian uterine weights from FRU queens were also recorded. Ovaries were hemi-sectioned, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, cut into sections (6 μm), stained with H&E, and evaluated at 200 X. Follicles were counted and classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary. More adult toms (16 / 16) than juvenile toms (4 / 13) had penile spines (p< 0. 05). Mean±SD morphologically normal sperm for the juvenile and adult <b>tom</b> <b>cats</b> was not significantly different (77 ± 11 % and 81 ± 13 %, respectively). Evidence of spermatogenesis in weanling, juvenile, pubertal, and adult toms was 0 %, 17 %, 67 %, and 100 %, respectively (p< 0. 05 between successive age groups). The seminiferous tubular diameter was significantly larger in each successive age group (weanlings 88. 10 ± 10. 88 µm; juveniles 109. 8 ± 8. 89 µm; pubertal 142. 2 ± 16. 89 µm; adult 237. 90 ± 52. 45 µm). FRU queen cats under 4 months old had more tertiary follicles compared to owned cats under 4 months of age (33 % and 17 %, respectively; p< 0. 05). Total ovarian uterine weights were significantly higher in 4 - 6 month old FRU queens compared to under 4 months (1. 18 ± 0. 31 g vs 0. 93 ± 0. 28 g, respectively). These observations provide an explanation for why TNR efforts to reduce FRU cat populations have not successful. Selective pressures and a significantly shortened life span may be factors contributing to this finding...|$|R
