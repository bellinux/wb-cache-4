Large metal cornicles running along {{the base of the}} ceiling hide the illumination lamps. The walls are faced with bright marble and the floor with gray granite. The eastern hall is nicknamed Garmoshka (Garmon), because of its pylons (faced with yellowish marble) which look like a stretched accordion parallel to the length of the hall. The walls are faced with a greyish marble and the floor with bright granite.

50|$|Twin- or multi-cylinder engines {{may improve}} {{low-speed}} scavenging to one cylinder by {{shutting down the}} other cylinder at low speeds. This may be done simply by cutting the ignition spark to one, thus increasing the load on the other cylinder and thus the power and gas-flow required. This has the drawback of wasting fuel in the un-ignited cylinder, potentially also risking oiling-up its spark plug, More sophisticatedly, as was done for some Johnson outboard motors, the <b>transfer</b> <b>passage</b> for one cylinder may be closed by an additional throttle butterfly, shutting that cylinder off completely and routing all gas-flow through the other. This avoids the risk of plug-oiling and again increases gas-flow through the operating cylinder.|$|E

50|$|Osaka {{station is}} {{elevated}} above street level, {{on the second}} floor of the station complex. There are four concourses, corresponding to four sets of ticket gates: the Midosuji gates, serving as a transfer point to Hankyu and Subway Umeda Station and Higashi-Umeda Station; the Central gates, with access to Daimaru, Lucua, Yodobashi Camera, Umeda Sky Building, Grand Front and transfers to Hanshin Umeda and JR Kitashinchi Station; the Sakurabashi gates, with access to Osaka Garden City and transfers to Subway Nishi-Umeda Station, city bus, hotel shuttle buses and taxi; and the Bridge Gates, with direct access into Daimaru and Lucua, as well as a bridge passage to Hankyu Umeda. The Midosuji concourse is on the lower level, with escalators and elevators leading directly to platforms; the Central concourse has both direct escalators and a mezzanine-level <b>transfer</b> <b>passage</b> connected by stairs; the Sakurabashi concourse has gates on ground level but is primarily on the mezzanine level, connected to the central concourse by a corridor; and the Bridge Gate is on the third level above the platforms, and connected by escalators and elevators.|$|E

40|$|The {{optimization}} of {{heat transfer}} enhancing surfaces for compact heat exchangers is discussed. The heat <b>transfer</b> <b>passages</b> are parameterized through Bézier curves, and the optimum {{choice of the}} parameters is sought using both multi-objective and single objective optimization techniques. The objectives of the optimization are the maximization of the heat transfer rate and the minimization of the pressure drop encountered by the fluid crossing the passage. The objectives are evaluated in nondimensional form {{in terms of the}} Nusselt number and the friction factor. The investigation is carried out by means of CFD analyses, the fluid flowing in the passages is air, and turbulent flow is assumed. Two different turbulence models (namely, k- and k-!) are adopted in the optimization processes and the effect of the choice of the turbulence model on the optimization outcome is discussed...|$|R

30|$|Walking time {{prediction}} aims {{to deduce}} waiting time and travel time for passengers {{and provide a}} quantitative basis for the subway schedule management. This model is founded based on transfer passenger flow and type of pedestrian facilities. Chaoyangmen station in Beijing was taken as the learning set to obtain the relationship between transfer walking speed and passenger volume. The sectional passenger volume of different facilities was calculated related to the <b>transfer</b> <b>passage</b> classification. Model parameters were computed by curve fitting with respect to various pedestrian facilities. The testing set contained four transfer stations with large passenger volume. It is validated that the established model is effective and practical. The proposed model offers a real-time prediction method with good applicability. It can provide transfer scheme reference for passengers, meanwhile, improve the scheduling {{and management of the}} subway operation.|$|E
40|$|Marburgvirus (MARV) {{infections are}} {{generally}} lethal in humans and nonhuman primates but require in vivo lethal mouse variant selection by the serial <b>transfer</b> (<b>passage)</b> of the nonlethal virus into naïve mice to propagate a lethal infection. The passage of progenitor (wild-type) MARV or Ravn virus (RAVV) from infected scid BALB/c mouse liver homogenates into immunocompetent BALB/c mice {{results in the}} selection of lethal mouse viruses from within the quasispecies sufficient to establish lethality in immunocompetent mice. Genomic analysis in conjunction with the passage history of each mutation detailed the altered primary and secondary structures of the viral genomic RNA throughout the process. Key findings included the following: (i) a VP 40 :D 184 N mutation previously identified in the lethal guinea pig MARV genome was the first mutation to occur during the passage of both the MARV and RAVV variants; (ii) there was biased hypermutagenesis in the RAVV variant genome; (iii) there were two identical mutations in lethal mouse MARV and RAVV variants, VP 40 :Y 19 H in the PPPY motif and VP 40 :D 184 N in a loop structure between the two VP 40 domains; (iv) the passage of wild-type MARV and RAVV in mice resulted {{in the selection of}} viral variants from among the quasispecies with different genotypes than those of the wild-type viruses; and (v) a lethal mouse RAVV variant had different tissue tropisms distinct from those of its wild-type virus. These studies provide insights into how marburgviruses manipulate the host for enzymes, metabolites, translation regulators, and effectors of the innate immune response to serve as potential viral countermeasures...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Cell {{culture is}} {{typically}} performed in Petri dishes, {{with a few}} million cells growing together, or in microwell plates with thousands of cells in each compartment. When the throughput of each experiment, especially of screening based assays, is increased, even using microliter solution per well will cost {{a considerable amount of}} cells and reagents. We took a ra-tional approach to reduce the volume of each cell culture cham-ber. We designed and fabricated a poly(dimethylsiloxane) based liquid pipet chip to deliver and transfer nanoliter (50 − 500 nL) samples and reagents with high accuracy and robustness. A few tens to a few hundreds of cells can be successfully seeded, <b>transferred,</b> <b>passaged,</b> transfected, and stimulated by drugs on a microwell chip using this pipet chip automatically. We have used this system to test the cell growth dynamically, observed the correlation between the culture conditions and cell viabilities, and quantitatively evaluated cell apoptosis induced by cis-diammineplatinum(II) dichloride (cisplatin). This system shows great potential to facilitate large-scale screening and high-throughput cell-array based bioassays with the volume of each individual cell colony at the nanoliter level...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} laminar flow in serpentine channels with periodically repeating elements, with application to heat <b>transfer</b> <b>passages</b> within complex compact heat exchangers. A methodology has been developed to determine the fully-developed flow and heat transfer behaviour in such channels with a constant wall heat flux using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Utilising this approach, flow characteristics are investigated for a fixed geometry, with L/d = 4. 5 and Rc/d = 1, {{for a range of}} Reynolds numbers up to 200. Pressure loss and heat transfer within a repeating module is compared with that expected from fully-developed flow in a straight pipe of equivalent path length. Dean vortices are generated in the flow and their rotation sense and intensity are dependent on the bend direction and Reynolds number. They are shown to suppress recirculation around bends and to be responsible for the high heat transfer rate with a relatively low pressure drop. The effect of the length to diameter ratio (L/d) on pressure loss and heat transfer performance is also reported for a Reynolds number of 110, wit...|$|R
40|$|A facile {{strategy}} {{was applied for}} poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PVDF-CTFE) hydrophobic membrane preparation by tuning the two-stage phase inversion process. The exposure stage was found to benefit the solid-liquid demixing process (gelation/crystallization) induced by the solvent evaporation and the subsequent phase inversion induced by immersion benefit the liquid-liquid demixing. It was confirmed that the electrospun nanostructure-like biomimetic surface and interconnected pore structure can be expected by controlling the exposure duration, and 300 s was considered as the inflection point of exposure duration for PVDF-CTFE membrane through which a tremendous variation would show. The micro/nanohierarchical structure in the membrane surface owing to the crystallization of PVDF-CTFE copolymer {{was responsible for the}} improvement of membrane roughness and hydrophobicity. Meanwhile, the interconnected pore structure in both the surface and the cross-section, which were formed because of the crystallization process, offers more mass <b>transfer</b> <b>passages</b> and enhances the permeate flux. The membrane then showed excellent MD performance with high permeate flux, high salt rejection, and relatively high stability during a 48 h continuous DCMD operation, according to the morphology, pore structure, and properties, which can be a substitute for hydrophobic membrane application...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of endothermic fuels {{is important for}} providing efficient cooling to scramjet combustors operating at high Mach numbers. Generally the fuel itself {{can be used as}} coolant for the engine elements. Since preheating the fuel is desirable before combustion, it can be circulated in heat <b>transfer</b> <b>passages</b> em-bedded inside the hot engine parts so that the excess heat of the engine is removed by the fuel and in the process the fuel is also regeneratively preheated to the desired temperature. Endo-thermic fuels pertain to a class of fuels, which make use of certain endothermic reactions to provide an additional heat sink for cooling the engine hot end parts through embedded heat ex-change devices. While traditional fuels use only the sensible heat of the fuels for cooling, endothermic fuels provide cooling through two routes, namely, the absorption of the sensible heat and through the use of endothermic reactions. At the Propulsion Division, NAL, the concept of endothermic cooling has been ex-perimentally demonstrated using kerosene as the fuel and molec-ular sieves as the cracking catalyst. A laboratory scale catalytic reactor was used for carrying out the catalytic reaction. A differ-ence of 114 K was observed for endothermic cooling whereas the conventional method of cooling gave only 18 K. The details of this important experiment are described in this pape...|$|R

60|$|The old {{material}} {{stands in}} a different position. Efforts {{have been made to}} discover the original letters, and sometimes with success. But it still remains true that, speaking generally, the printed text of the letters published by Moore, Dallas, Leigh Hunt, and others, has not been collated with the originals. The fact is important. Moore, who, it is believed, destroyed not only his own letters from Byron, but also many of those entrusted to him for the preparation of the 'Life', allowed himself unusual liberties as an editor. The examples of this licence given in Mr. Clayden's 'Rogers and his Contemporaries' throw suspicion on his text, even where no apparent motive exists for his suppressions. But, as Byron's letters became more bitter in tone, and his criticisms of his contemporaries more outspoken, Moore felt himself more justified in omitting passages which referred to persons who were still living in 1830. From 1816 onwards, it will be found that he has <b>transferred</b> <b>passages</b> from one letter to another, or printed two letters as one, and 'vice versâ', or made such large omissions as to shorten letters, in some instances, by a third or even a half. No collation with the originals has ever been attempted, and the garbled text which Moore printed is the only text at present available for an edition of the most important of Byron's letters. But the originals {{of the majority of the}} letters published in the 'Life', from 1816 to 1824, are in the possession or control of Mr. Murray, and in his edition they will be for the first time printed as they were written. If any passages are omitted, the omissions will be indicated.|$|R
