Amy returns to Leadworth and rejoins Rory in defending her house from the Eknodine whilst the Doctor is trying to rescue people from Leadworth in a motor-caravan. As Amy believes she is going into labour, Rory is sprayed by the Eknodine and turns to dust. Amy decides that she is willing to risk her own life for the chance of seeing Rory again and concludes the Leadworth reality is false. Amy and the Doctor drive the motor-caravan into the house, leading to their assumed deaths. The three wake up again on the TARDIS where they are congratulated by <b>the</b> <b>Dream</b> Lord, who then reactivates the TARDIS. After <b>the</b> <b>Dream</b> Lord's departure Amy and Rory are surprised by the Doctor when he directs the TARDIS to self-destruct, apparently killing them all.|$|E

5|$|The three wake {{up again}} on the TARDIS, no longer in any danger.

5|$|Unique to Black and White is the Pokémon Dream World, {{which is}} {{dependent}} on the official Pokémon Global Link website. Here, the player can befriend Pokémon that are not normally obtainable in-game and that have unique abilities.

The player can maintain a house in <b>the</b> <b>Dream</b> World that other players can visit as well as grow berries. In addition to allowing access to Pokémon acquired in <b>the</b> <b>Dream</b> World, the Entralink also enables players to interact with each other and play side-games. These side-games award points that can be traded for temporary powers such as increasing experience, improving capture rate, or lowering prices of items in Poké Marts.|$|E

5000|$|As an ideology, <b>The</b> <b>Dreaming</b> is {{immaterial}} but {{in another}} sense, <b>The</b> <b>Dreaming</b> flourishes because it consists of material and verbal possessions—myths, names, songs, ceremonies, and sacred objects inherited {{from one generation to}} the next. In this way, <b>The</b> <b>Dreaming</b> itself encompasses vast inalienable possessions that are authenticated by the very cosmology under which they are produced. These possessions created in and authenticated by <b>The</b> <b>Dreaming</b> circulate from one person or group to another in a limited way. The possibilities of transmission in the face of the canon for guardianship establish for ritual leaders a domain of authority that in certain situations leads to a formalized position of rank.|$|R
