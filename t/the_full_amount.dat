5|$|In May 2010, the Barr {{campaign}} was sued by libertarian pundit Jim Bovard, {{who was hired}} to ghostwrite {{a book about the}} campaign. Bovard claims he was never paid the $47,000 he was to receive for his efforts. Campaign manager Russ Verney stated that the campaign hoped to raise enough money to pay Bovard, and asked for donations. The ensuing litigation resulted in a judgment entered for Bovard against the Bar 2008 Presidential Committee, Inc., in <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>amount</b> of $47,000.00.|$|E
5|$|The Dulles–Cuhna communiqué {{touched off}} anti-American demonstrations {{in many parts}} of India. On December 6, Dulles held a news conference during which he reaffirmed U.S. {{neutrality}} on the Goa issue, but did not recant claims of Portuguese sovereignty over the region. Prime Minister Nehru announced his intent to file a formal protest with the United States over the communiqué and to address the Indian Parliament about the matter. In the interim, Cooper secured a meeting with Nehru and forestalled both actions. Cooper became even more upset with Dulles when Dulles authorized withholding $10million of a $50million aid package to India; Cooper protested the withholding, and Dulles decided to pay <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>amount.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Historic Chapels Trust {{obtained}} {{an estimate}} for the restoration, which amounted to £2.5m. Unable to meet <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>amount,</b> the Trust decided {{to undertake the}} restoration in phases. The first phase was completed in September 2007 {{at a cost of}} nearly £900,000, which included weatherproofing and major works to the roof. Of the money raised for this, £262,500 came from the Heritage Lottery Fund, £200,000 from English Heritage, £250,000 from Stoke-on-Trent City Council, and a further £20,000 was raised locally. The second phase of restoration commenced in August 2010 and was completed a year later. The Trust spent £600,000 restoring the galleries, staircases and pulpits, replacing the organ and renovating the exterior ironwork. Funds are currently being raised for the final phase of restoration, which will include installation of a new heating and lighting system.|$|E
5|$|Hutton scored 2,049 runs at {{an average}} of 56.91 in the 1950 season. Batting {{effectively}} on a succession of early season rain-affected wickets, Hutton frequently top-scored for Yorkshire. Hutton's benefit match against Middlesex was affected by rain, but other events, collections and insurance for loss of play gave Hutton £9,713, a record at that point for a Yorkshire cricketer. Two-thirds of the amount was invested on Hutton's behalf by the Yorkshire committee, following their usual practice; Hutton resented this paternalism from the committee, particularly as he did not receive <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>amount</b> until 1972. Hutton played in three of the four Tests against West Indies. In the first Test, hampered by a finger injury, he scored 39 and 45 as England recorded their only victory of the series. The West Indies won the second Test, their first Test victory in England, and won the final two Tests to take the series 3–1; Hutton missed the third Test with lumbago but in the fourth Test scored 202 not out, carrying his bat through England's first innings. The West Indian spinners Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine caused difficulties for all the batsmen except Hutton, who always appeared comfortable. Wisden praised his effort as unforgettable.|$|E
5|$|Voter {{approval}} of the referendum created a public–private partnership. The Washington State Public Stadium Authority was created to oversee public ownership of the stadium, exhibition center, and parking garage complex. Allen purchased the Seahawks and formed First & Goal Inc. to build and operate the facility. The budget for the project was $430million. Of this cost, $44million was allotted to build the Event Center, $26million for the parking garage, and $360million for the stadium. First & Goal was to cover cost overruns and pay up to $130million of the project while the contribution from the public was capped at $300million. The public funding package included new sports-related state lottery games, taxes on the facility's admissions and parking, sales tax credits and deferrals, and an eight-year extension of the 2% tax on hotel rooms in King County. The taxes on admissions and parking are set at 2% {{to pay off the}} project's tax-exempt bonds. Those taxes will be kept below the authorized 10% to preserve the tax-exempt status, but the percentage will be increased to <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>amount</b> when the bonds are completely paid in 2021. At such time, they will become dedicated funding sources for maintenance and modernization of the facilities.|$|E

5|$|The Pipe rolls are {{the records}} of the audits of the sheriffs' accounts, usually {{conducted}} at Michaelmas by the Exchequer, or English treasury. Until the chancery records began in the reign of King John of England, they were the only continuous set of records kept by the English government. They are not a complete record of government and royal finances, however, as they do not record all sources of income, only the accounts of the sheriffs and a few other sources of income. Some of the payments that did not regularly fall under the Exchequer were occasionally recorded in a Pipe roll. Neither do the Pipe rolls record all payments made by the exchequer. They were not created as a budget, nor were they strictly speaking records of receipts, but rather they are records of the audit of the accounts rendered. Although the rolls use an accounting system, it is not one that would be familiar to modern accountants; for instance {{until the end of the}} 12th century, no record was made of the total amount taken in by the sheriff of each shire. In their early form, they record all debts owed to the Crown, whether from feudal dues or from other sources. Because many debts to the king were allowed to be paid off in installments, it is necessary to search more than one set of rolls for a complete history of a debt. If a debt was not paid off completely in one year, the remainder of the amount owed was transferred to the next year. They did not record <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>amount</b> of debts incurred in previous years, only what was paid that year and what was still owed. Besides the sheriffs, others who submitted accounts for the audit included some bailiffs of various honours, town officials, and the custodians of ecclesiastical and feudal estates.|$|E

50|$|For the 2011-12 school year, Northgate School Board {{applied for}} three {{exceptions}} {{to exceed the}} Act 1 Index: Maintenance of Selected Revenue Sources, Special Education costs, and Teacher pension costs. While the District received approval for all three exceptions, they did not receive <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>amounts</b> requested. Each year, Northgate School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February.

50|$|Banks {{are allowed}} (and usually encouraged) to lend or invest {{most of the}} money {{deposited}} with them instead of safe-keeping <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>amounts</b> (see fractional-reserve banking). If many of a bank's borrowers fail to repay their loans when due, the bank's creditors, including its depositors, risk loss. Because they rely on customer deposits that can be withdrawn on little or no notice, banks in financial trouble are prone to bank runs, where depositors seek to withdraw funds quickly ahead of a possible bank insolvency. Because banking institution failures have the potential to trigger a broad spectrum of harmful events, including economic recessions, policy makers maintain deposit insurance schemes to protect depositors and to give them comfort that their funds are not at risk.|$|R

Depositors with uninsured funds and other general creditors (such as suppliers and service providers) of the failed institution do not receive either immediate or full reimbursement; instead, the FDIC as receiver issues them receivership certificates.
