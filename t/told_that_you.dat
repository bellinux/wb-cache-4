5|$|Hańska {{wrote to}} Balzac {{several times during}} 1832. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are still young. I would like to know you, but feel that I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E
500|$|Equally {{proficient}} {{as both a}} blocker and runner, Johnson {{was described}} as [...] "the perfect NFL fullback". A talented runner, he ran with power {{both inside and outside}} the tackles, and he was as fast as McElhenny and Perry. Jim Brown called Johnson the greatest running back he had ever seen. He was also a very skilled safety and linebacker on defense. During a preseason game in 1955, Johnson hit Chicago Cardinals halfback Charley Trippi so hard that he fractured Trippi's face in multiple places, leaving him with a smashed nose and concussion and all but ended his career. [...] "Football was like a combat zone," [...] said Johnson. [...] "I was always <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> carry the impact to the opponent. If you wait for it, the impact will be on you." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{general manager}} of the Wenatchee Chiefs, Dasso {{organized}} a promotion in July 1953 called [...] "Bust Down the Fences Night" [...] in a game against the Tri-City Braves, in which attendees at the game were <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could [...] "pay what you like; no regular admission". Gate receipts from the 3,200 in attendance at the game was $1,251, an average of 40 cents per fan, earning the team more in profit from that one game than any three games they had played in that season to-date.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, {{a company}} known as [...] "Domain Renewal SA" [...] {{operating}} from Brussels was sending out emails <b>that</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> need to renew your domain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Huh," [...] grunted the king. [...] "Yes, you are Korak. My ears <b>told</b> me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were Korak. My eyes <b>told</b> me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were Korak. Now my nose {{tells me}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are Korak. My nose is never wrong. I am your friend. Come, we shall hunt together." ...|$|R
60|$|DAISY. How dare you? How dare <b>you?</b> I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{were never}} to let Lee Tai {{speak to you}} again.|$|R
2500|$|The University of Florida {{researchers}} initially considered naming {{their product}} [...] "Gator-Aid". They {{settled on the}} name Gatorade, however, since the researchers {{wanted to create a}} commercial product, not a scientifically-validated one. Darren Rovell notes his history of Gatorade, First in Thirst, [...] "the doctors realized that they probably shouldn't use the 'Aid' suffix, since that would mean that if the drink were ever marketed, they would have to prove that it had a clear medicinal use and perform clinical tests on thousands of people." [...] Gatorade co-inventor Dana Shires explained, [...] "We were <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> couldn't use that because the Food and Drug Administration prohibited that. That would classify it as something other than a cola or soft drink, so we changed it to ade." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Then, to be <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{discontinued}} {{your study}} with me, {{was to be}} politely <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> abandoned it altogether?’ he suggested.|$|E
60|$|DAISY. Why do you lie to me? I've been <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{were engaged}} to her.|$|E
60|$|Pala. But, {{who told}} you I was here? they, <b>that</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>that,</b> may tell <b>you</b> more, for aught I know.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Plantagenet!' {{said his}} mother again in a solemn tone, 'have I not always <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are never to {{contradict}} any one?' ...|$|R
60|$|MRS TARLETON. Johnny: {{how often}} have I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must not bully the little ones. I thought youd outgrown all that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] remarked Ervic, who {{had been}} pondering on the strange {{circumstances}} of his coming here, [...] "you are right in some ways, but not in others. I am <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> work magic only for your own amusement. That seems to me very selfish. Few people understand magic. I'm <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are the only real Yookoohoo in all Oz. Why don't you amuse others as well as yourself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! yes. Well, General Olaf, of my mother's guard, {{have you}} not been <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should salute the Augustus before the Augusta?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Staveley began nicely; [...] "I suppose, Eunice, {{you have}} often been <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have a good figure, and that you walk well?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! I see <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are ready, Macumazahn," [...] {{he said in}} {{a cheerful}} voice. [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should not go away hungry, did I not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. I <b>told</b> them <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{were making}} {{up your mind}} and I came along just then. I <b>told</b> them <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were saved by me. My shout checked you..." [...] She moved her head gently {{from right to left}} in negation.--"No? Well, have it your own way." ...|$|R
3000|$|... 曾經有人批評你的賭博行為或你有賭博的問題(就算你無感覺這是真的)? (Have people criticized your betting or <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have a {{gambling}} problem, {{whether or not}} you thought it was true?) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "To be <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are loved," [...] {{said the}} Girton Girl, [...] "is only the {{beginning}} of the theorem--its proposition, so to speak." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are {{now free}} from any scruples,--political scruples, I mean,--which {{might make it}} {{difficult}} for you to support the Government." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{would she}} say, {{if she were}} <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> and I were going to marry those two girls? We are both favourites, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dearest," [...] she whispered, [...] "haven't I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> shall take my {{life into}} your keeping and {{do with it}} what you will?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are a {{very simple}} person," [...] she said. [...] "Even you are not given to intrigues. I thank you for rescuing me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And Adelaide is lucky, too, for I {{doubt whether}} {{either of you}} are given to any very {{penetrating}} economies. I am <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> like hunting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You say that, Lady Ongar, but do {{you mean}} it?" [...] she asked. [...] "We have been <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> also are engaged to marry Mr. Clavering." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{care whether}} he comes or not. What I mean is this. When I was here before, I was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were going--to marry him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are to {{call him}} uncle," [...] the woman said sharply, but not unkindly. [...] "I have told you so over and over again, child." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Young men {{are taught}} to think more seriously {{than they were in}} our day,' said Mrs. Frost. 'I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must not try to make him turn squire.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is a big}} matter," [...] said Martin. [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had no {{business}} to come at all if you couldn't look it squarely in the face." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] exclaimed {{the princess}} delightedly; [...] "you speak my language! I was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were of another race and from some far land {{of which we}} of Pal-ul-don have never heard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not afraid," [...] she said, [...] "not {{one little}} bit, and I don't {{see why you}} should mind being <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are young and quiet-looking and nice, when you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will understand, at least, that I {{am asking}} nothing from you because he wishes it. Laura {{probably}} has <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> may make things straight by becoming my wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Watson, {{how many}} times have I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> make too much noise with your musical instruments?" [...] he said, harshly. [...] "You disturb the {{students}} who wish to study." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense!" [...] put in Henry. [...] "You {{can shoot}} as {{straight}} as any of us, and I know it, and walk just as far, too. Who <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> couldn't?" ...|$|R
