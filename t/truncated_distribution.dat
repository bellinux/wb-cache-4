40|$|We derive a novel variational {{expectation}} maximization approach {{based on}} <b>truncated</b> variational <b>distributions.</b> The <b>truncated</b> <b>distributions</b> are proportional to exact posteriors in {{a subset of}} a discrete state space and equal zero otherwise. In contrast to factored variational approximations or Gaussian approximations, truncated approximations neither assume posterior independence nor mono-modal posteriors. The novel variational approach {{is closely related to}} Expectation Truncation (LÃ¼cke and Eggert, 2010) - a preselection based EM approximation. It shares with Expectation Truncation the central idea of <b>truncated</b> <b>distributions</b> and the application domain of discrete hidden variables. In contrast to Expectation Truncation we here show how <b>truncated</b> <b>distributions</b> can be included into the theoretical framework of variational EM approximations. A fully variational treatment of <b>truncated</b> <b>distributions</b> then allows for derivations of novel general and mathematically grounded results, which in turn can be used to formulate novel efficient algorithms for parameter optimization of probabilistic data models. Apart from showing that <b>truncated</b> <b>distributions</b> are fully consistent with the variational free-energy framework, we find the free-energy that corresponds to <b>truncated</b> <b>distributions</b> to be given by compact and efficiently computable expressions, while update equations for model parameters (M-steps) remain in their standard form.

Based on these observations, we show how an efficient and easily applicable meta-algorithm can be formulated that guarantees a monotonic increase of the free-energy. More generally, the obtained variational framework developed here links variational E-steps to discrete optimization, and it provides a theoretical basis to tightly couple sampling and variational approaches...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{probability}} distribution of travel {{time is the}} foundation of travel time estimation or modeling travel time variability and reliability. With considering the fact that travel time is distributed in a limited range, we use a <b>truncated</b> <b>distribution</b> to model the distribution of travel time in a signalized road section. Link travel time is decomposed into time-in-motion (the time a vehicle is actually moving) and time-in-queue. Time-in-motion is modeled using a <b>truncated</b> <b>distribution,</b> while time-in-queue is modeled as a mixed distribution consisting of a mass distribution and a uniform distribution. A probability density function for travel time is then derived and parameterized by fraction of queuing vehicles, red signal time, and motion behavior parameters including truncation points. These parameters are obtained from sample link travel times using a maximum likelihood estimator. In the experiment, a four-intersection network is developed in VISSIM, 10 % probe vehicles in traffic are assumed in the test network. Time-in-motion and link travel time exhibit significant truncation, and they are better modeled by truncated distributions than by non-truncated distributions. Additionally, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is performed to test the estimated models of link travel time distribution from probe vehicle data with various polling frequencies. The results show, the link travel time distribution can be estimated from probe data that polling interval is less than 10 s when the significance level is set to 0. 01...|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>truncated</b> <b>distributions</b> arises {{often in}} a wide variety of {{scientific}} problems. In the literature, there are a lot of sampling schemes and proposals developed for various specific <b>truncated</b> <b>distributions.</b> So far, however, the study of the truncated multivariate t (TMVT) distribution is rarely discussed. In this paper, we first present general formulae for computing the first two moments of the TMVT distribution under the double truncation. We formulate the results as analytic matrix expressions, which can be directly computed in existing software. Results for the left and right truncation can be viewed as special cases. We then apply the slice sampling algorithm to generate random variates from the TMVT distribution by introducing auxiliary variables. This strategic approach can result in a series of full conditional densities that are of uniform distributions. Finally, several examples and practical applications are given to illustrate the effectiveness and importance of the proposed results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
