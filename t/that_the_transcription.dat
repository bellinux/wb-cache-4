25|$|Feathers are {{epidermal}} growths {{that form}} the distinctive outer covering, or plumage, on birds. They are considered the most complex integumentary structures found in vertebrates and a premier example of a complex evolutionary novelty. The exact signals that induce the growth of feathers on the skin are not known, {{but it has been}} found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> factor cDermo-1 induces the growth of feathers on skin and scales on the leg.|$|E
25|$|A {{team led}} by Sheena Josselyn in the Silva Lab {{discovered}} that there are molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate which neurons in a circuit encode a given memory (neuronal memory allocation). They found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> factor CREB modulates the probability that individual amygdala neurons become involved in storing a specific emotional memory: higher levels of CREB increase this probability while lower levels of CREB have the opposite effect. Later, Yu Zhou and colleagues in the Silva lab discovered that CREB modulates memory allocation by regulating neuronal excitability. These studies suggested that the mechanisms that consolidate one memory, for a limited period of time, {{may be involved in}} determining the allocation of the next memory, so that the two memories are associated or linked.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} part of the epic poem Mahabharata, it is written that the sage Vyasa (...) asked Ganesha to {{transcribe}} the poem as he dictated it to him. Ganesha agreed, but only on the condition that Vyasa recite the poem uninterrupted, without pausing. The sage, in his turn, posed the condition that Ganesha would not only have to write, but would have to understand everything that he heard before writing it down. In this way, Vyasa might recuperate a bit from his continuous talking by simply reciting a difficult verse which Ganesha could not understand. The dictation began, but in the rush of writing Ganesha's feather pen broke. He broke off a tusk and used it as a pen so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> could proceed without interruption, permitting him to keep his word.|$|E
30|$|The {{result of}} {{applying}} the statistical model to CETEMPúblico vocabulary was fairly accurate, although with some significant flaws. Then, we followed a long procedure of manual verification and correction of <b>the</b> <b>transcriptions.</b> <b>The</b> {{next step was}} to compare <b>the</b> <b>transcriptions</b> with other ones, generated by a commercial speech synthesizer. This comparison allowed us to rely on our results since the majority of <b>the</b> <b>transcriptions</b> agreed. All different transcriptions were analyzed one by one and we found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcriptions</b> from our dictionary were the right ones most of the times. This has led to <b>the</b> phonological <b>transcription</b> dictionary referred to as “dic_CETEMP_ 40 k”.|$|R

50|$|The histone code is a {{hypothesis}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> of genetic information encoded in DNA {{is in part}} regulated by chemical modifications to histone proteins, primarily on their unstructured ends.

50|$|The protein's {{function}} is to transport monosaccharide sugars into these sink tissues. The protein is classed as a symporter since sodium ions are also transported concurrently in the same direction.

5000|$|The {{analysis}} of the promoter region (tools on the page rVista [...] were used) shows that there are several transcription factor binding sites localized in conserved regions [...] It is very likely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> factor Ets-1 which belongs to the ETS transcription factor family and its core binding factor CBF are involved in regulation of transcription since they both have independent binding sites.|$|E

50|$|GOMO or Gene Ontology for MOtifs is a {{tool for}} {{identifying}} possible roles for DNA binding motifs.It does so by comparing genes the motif occurs upstream of to a Gene Ontology database.If the motif occurs statistically significantly upstream of genes related to a particular function (for example, lactose digestion), it suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> factor that binds the motif may regulate that function (for example, by promoting transcription of proteins that digest lactose).|$|E
50|$|The egg {{chamber of}} the Drosophila ovary {{contains}} 16 central germline cells surrounded by a monolayer epithelium of about 1000 follicle cells. At stage 9 of Drosophila oogenesis, these cells perform a stereotypical invasive migration on the intervening nurse cells, and reach the oocyte. The migration consists of an initial posterior migration, followed by another in the dorsal direction. It is now known <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> factor Slbo (slow border cells) is a master regulator of the migratory phenotype.|$|E
50|$|The {{result is}} that this {{articles}} transcription is almost directly phonemic, making it significantly easier for readers {{not familiar with the}} complications of Cyrillic spelling. Note <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> used here continues the standard practice of representing the Cyrillic letters ы и as y i, although they are normally considered allophones of each other. This is because the pronunciation of the two letters is significantly different, and Russian ы normally continues Common Slavic *y , which was a separate phoneme.|$|E

50|$|Hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNFs) are a {{group of}} phylogenetically {{unrelated}} <b>transcription</b> factors <b>that</b> regulate <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> of {{a diverse group of}} genes into proteins.

50|$|It {{has been}} found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> level <b>transcription</b> of {{integrated}} retroviruses depends on both genetic and chromatin remodeling {{at the site of}} integration.

50|$|The {{expression}} of the human hemopexin gene in different human tissues and cell lines {{was carried out by}} using the specific cDNA probe. From the results obtained it can be concluded that this gene is expressed in liver and, in lower amount, in hepatoma cell lines but not in kidney, spleen, placental cells, and in HeLa, fibroblast cell lines.By S1 mapping it can also said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> initiation site in hepatic cells is 28 base pairs upstream from the AUG initiation codon of the hemopexin gene.|$|E
50|$|Enhancers are DNA {{sequences}} {{found in}} 5' flanking regions of eukaryotic genes that affect transcription. If a transcription factor binds to an enhancer in a 5' flanking region, the DNA strand bends {{in a way}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> factor that is bound to the enhancer can also bind the promoter of a gene. This leads to RNA polymerase recruitment and interaction with transcription factors and the promoter, and an overall higher transcription rate than the basal level. Although enhancers are usually present upstream of the transcription start site, they can be present anywhere on or around the gene of interest.|$|E
