5|$|Wind also limits <b>tree</b> <b>growth.</b> On coasts and {{isolated}} mountains, {{the tree line}} is often much lower than in corresponding altitudes inland and in larger, more complex mountain systems, because strong winds reduce <b>tree</b> <b>growth.</b> High winds scour away thin soils through erosion, as well as damage limbs and twigs. When high winds knock down or uproot trees, the process is known as windthrow. This is most likely on windward slopes of mountains, with severe cases generally occurring to tree stands that are 75years or older. Plant varieties near the coast, such as the Sitka spruce and sea grape, are pruned back by wind and salt spray near the coastline.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tree</b> <b>growth</b> above those patches is curtailed by {{the alpine}} {{climate of the}} pass. It is {{characterized}} by severe changes in temperature, high winds and the deep winter snow. The resulting short growing season is made even shorter by the thin soil.|$|E
50|$|Falcataria moluccana is {{the primary}} host of the gall rust fungus Uromycladium falcatarium, and has also been {{recorded}} as a host of Uromycladium tepperianum. Both of these gall rust species cause severe damage throughout all stages of the <b>tree's</b> <b>growth.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The c. 304 Nanfang Caomu Zhuang {{mentions}} sweetgum <b>tree</b> <b>growths</b> in a {{quite different}} context, the shamans in the southern state of Yue use a magical fēngrén (楓人 [...] "sweetgum person") that {{is a kind of}} liúyǐng (瘤癭 [...] "gall") found growing on sweetgum trees. [...] "When aged they develop tumors. Sometimes in a violent thunder storm, the tree tumors grow suddenly three to five feet in one night, and these are called Feng-jen. The witches of Yueh collect these for witchcraft, saying that they have proof of their supernatural quality." [...] (tr. Li 1979: 77). Later sources gave two explanations of the sweetgum <b>tree</b> <b>growths,</b> either as galls that resemble humans and have magical powers or as parasitic plants with rain-giving powers (1979: 78-79).|$|R
50|$|Harvesters make incisions {{across the}} latex vessels, just {{deep enough to}} tap the vessels without harming the <b>tree's</b> <b>growth,</b> and the latex is {{collected}} in small buckets. This process is known as rubber tapping. Latex production is highly variable {{from tree to tree}} and across clone types.|$|R
5|$|Another {{method that}} has been used to {{establish}} the date of eruption is tree-ring dating. Tree-ring data has shown that a large event interfering with normal <b>tree</b> <b>growth</b> in North America occurred during 1629–1628 (±65 years)BCE. Evidence of a climatic event around 1628BCE has been found in studies of growth depression of European oaks in Ireland and of Scotch pines in Sweden. Bristlecone pine frost rings also indicate a date of 1627BCE, supporting the late 1600sBCE dating. Procedural changes in how ice cores are interpreted would bring that data more in line with the dendrochronological numbers.|$|E
5|$|Aphids: There {{are five}} species of aphids {{commonly}} found on apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species {{can be identified}} by their color, {{the time of year}} when they are present and by differences in the cornicles, which are small paired projections from the rear of aphids. Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce <b>tree</b> <b>growth</b> and vigor.|$|E

The upper park is dominated by the mountain springs, {{as well as by the}} native southern coast forestry and clusters of foreign <b>tree</b> <b>growth.</b> A feature of the upper park is the Fountain of Trilby, which was placed there in 1829. The lower park is modelled upon a style called the Italian Renaissance garden. It features three pairs of Medici lions near the staircase leading up to the palace's southern façade, carved out of carrara marble by sculptor Giovanni Bonnani.|$|E

40|$|It is an {{important}} question to calculate number of grown branches in a tree in visualization of <b>trees</b> <b>growth.</b> The number of growth branches is determined by visual effect or developer′s experience. This paper overcomes disadvantages of branches calculation by man-made factors, and proposes an algorithm to calculate number of branches belonged to a tree based on extend square root principle of fractal. It {{is a result of}} cartography combination with math, forestry and computer graphics. This method can calculate number of a tree’s branches after growing based on the tree heights before and after growing period of time, the number of a tree’s branches before growing period of time, and the tree branches fractal. The paper offers deducing procession and application example of the expressions. It can be used in spatio-temporal GIS and in visualization of plant’s <b>growth</b> especially <b>tree’s</b> <b>growth.</b> 1...|$|R

The second log cut from each tree (i.e., from a location 1 – 2  m above the ground) was used for measurement of diameter growth at breast height, MFA, density, and mechanical properties in bending. The other logs were cut into 5 -cm-thick disks in the longitudinal direction to examine the process of <b>tree</b> height <b>growth.</b> The small disks near treetops and second logs of each tree were not examined for the process of <b>tree</b> height <b>growth.</b> Therefore, the <b>tree</b> height <b>growth</b> was examined in fewer rings than diameter growth.|$|R

Rock climbers and botanical collectors have also damaged populations of the fern. Toxic runoff from atop cliffs can affect them, and {{they may also be}} threatened by both natural and anthropogenic shading of cliffs due to increased <b>tree</b> <b>growth</b> at the cliff base, invasive vines overrunning the cliff face, or the piling of slash against the cliff after logging.|$|E
5|$|The incline {{from there}} is not visible because of <b>tree</b> <b>growth</b> and it is {{difficult}} to get access to it without unreasonable encroachment on private property, although the OS map shows a public footpath crossing the incline about two-thirds of the way up. The remains of Brendon Hill station are Grade II listed. The remains of the summit winding house can be approached but are dangerous to enter: they are located just west of the junction of the B3224 and B3190 roads. A chapel built to attend to the spiritual needs of the miners and their families still stands at the junction.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{points out}} that all changes of form are {{phenomena}} of growth. He analyses growth curves for man, noting rapid growth before birth {{and again in the}} teens; and then curves for other animals. In plants, growth is often in pulses, as in Spirogyra, peaks at a specific temperature, and below that value roughly doubles every 10 degrees Celsius. <b>Tree</b> <b>growth</b> varies cyclically with season (less strongly in evergreens), preserving a record of historic climates. Tadpole tails regenerate rapidly at first, slowing exponentially.|$|E
25|$|Forest monitoring: In recent period it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} the location of eruptive fractures could be predicted, months to years before the eruptions, by the monitoring of forest growth.

The <b>tree's</b> <b>growth</b> overruns the city, while a single tear falls down from Tolbiac's eye.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{expensive}} and laborious installation, concrete landscape curbing is usually utilized {{to create a}} permanent border. It is not particularly useful {{in areas where the}} landscape is likely to change, for example around a non-permanent swimming pool, which won't last forever, or a pine tree, where the border would need to expand with the <b>tree's</b> <b>growth.</b>|$|R
5|$|Fractals are {{infinitely}} self-similar, iterated mathematical constructs having fractal dimension. Infinite iteration is {{not possible}} in nature so all 'fractal' patterns are only approximate. For example, the leaves of ferns and umbellifers (Apiaceae) are only self-similar (pinnate) to 2, 3 or 4 levels. Fern-like growth patterns occur in plants and in animals including bryozoa, corals, hydrozoa like the air fern, Sertularia argentea, and in non-living things, notably electrical discharges. Lindenmayer system fractals can model different patterns of <b>tree</b> <b>growth</b> by varying {{a small number of}} parameters including branching angle, distance between nodes or branch points (internode length), and number of branches per branch point.|$|E
25|$|Summer warmth {{generally}} {{sets the}} limit to which <b>tree</b> <b>growth</b> can occur, for while timberline conifers are very frost-hardy {{during most of}} the year, they become sensitive to just 1 or 2 degrees of frost in mid-summer. A series of warm summers in the 1940s seems to have permitted the establishment of “significant numbers” of spruce seedlings above the previous treeline in the hills near Fairbanks, Alaska. Survival depends on a sufficiency of new growth to support the tree. The windiness of high-elevation sites is also a potent determinant of the distribution of <b>tree</b> <b>growth.</b> Wind can mechanically damage tree tissues directly, including blasting with wind-borne particles, and may also contribute to the desiccation of foliage, especially of shoots that project above snow cover.|$|E

25|$|On coasts and {{isolated}} mountains {{the tree line}} is often much lower than in corresponding altitudes inland and in larger, more complex mountain systems, because strong winds reduce <b>tree</b> <b>growth.</b> In addition the lack of suitable soil, such as along talus slopes or exposed rock formations, prevents trees from gaining an adequate foothold and exposes them to drought and sun.|$|E
25|$|Alpine tundra {{does not}} contain trees because the climate and soils at high {{altitude}} block <b>tree</b> <b>growth.</b> Alpine tundra is distinguished from arctic tundra in that alpine tundra typically does not have permafrost, and alpine soils are generally better drained than arctic soils. Alpine tundra transitions to subalpine forests below the tree line; stunted forests occurring at the forest-tundra ecotone (the treeline) are known as Krummholz.|$|E

25|$|The {{aboriginal}} people inhabited fixed village locations, and followed food sources seasonally, living near the coast in winter to harvest rich stocks of otter, mussels, abalone, and other sea life. In {{the summer and}} fall, they traveled inland to gather acorns and hunt deer. The native people hollowed mortar holes into large exposed rocks or boulders which they used to grind the acorns into flour. These can be found throughout the region. Arrows were of made of cane and pointed with hardwood foreshafts. The tribes also used controlled burning techniques to increase <b>tree</b> <b>growth</b> and food production.|$|E

In commerce in the USA, the tree is occasionally propagated by grafting onto an Ulmus pumila rootstock, rather than simply rooting cuttings as normally practiced in North America and Europe.|$|R
30|$|Ritchie and Hann ([1997]) {{provided}} an excellent review on disaggregation methods, classifying the disaggregating functions into additive and proportional. In the additive growth method, the basal area <b>growth</b> of each <b>tree</b> {{is equal to}} the average <b>tree</b> basal area <b>growth</b> plus an adjustment based on tree basal area (Harrison and Daniels [1988]) or tree diameter (Dhote [1994]). Another category of disaggregation methods involves proportional allocations that can be applied to either growth or yield. In the proportional yield method, predicted tree basal area is adjusted to match predicted stand basal area (Clutter and Allison [1974], Clutter and Jones [1980], Pienaar and Harrison [1988], Nepal and Somers [1992], McTague and Stansfield [1994], [1995]). The proportional growth method involves adjusting predicted <b>tree</b> basal area <b>growth</b> to match predicted stand basal area growth (Campbell et al. [1979], Moore et al. [1994]), <b>tree</b> volume <b>growth</b> to match stand volume growth (Dahms [1983], Zhang et al. [1993]), or <b>tree</b> diameter <b>growth</b> to match stand diameter growth (Leary et al.
