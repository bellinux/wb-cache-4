In 1967, Bayern retained the DFB-Pokal, but slow overall progress saw Branko Zebec <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>as</b> coach. He replaced Bayern's offensive style of play with a more disciplined approach, {{and in doing so}} achieved the first league and cup double in Bundesliga history in 1969. Bayern Munich are one of four German clubs to win the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal in the same season along with Borussia Dortmund, 1. FC Köln and Werder Bremen.
