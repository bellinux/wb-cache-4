5|$|Principles {{ensuring}} <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> {{capable of}} guiding behaviour.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{important}} principles spring from the basic idea {{of the rule of}} law. These may be divided into two groups: principles that ensure <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> capable of guiding its subjects' behaviour, and principles establishing legal machinery to secure compliance with the rule of law.|$|E
5|$|At {{present in}} the United States there are three {{different}} levels of scrutiny. Firstly, if a law categorizes {{on the basis of}} race or national origin (which are regarded as suspect classifications), or infringes a fundamental right, strict scrutiny is applied. Accordingly, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. In addition, there should not be a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling interest. Secondly, if the law categorizes on the basis of gender, legitimacy or similar quasi-suspect classifications, intermediate scrutiny is applied – <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> unconstitutional unless it is substantially related to an important government interest. Finally, the traditional rational basis review is applied if the law categorizes on some other, non-suspect, basis. In this case, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> {{challenged}} {{and taken to}} the European Court of Human Rights which upheld <b>the</b> <b>law</b> on 1 July 2014, accepting the argument of the French government that <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> based on [...] "a certain idea of living together".|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> {{passed by}} <b>the</b> South Korean {{parliament}} in March 2015. The bill received bipartisan support in parliament. <b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> formally promulgated by President Park Geun-hye as Act No. 13278 on March 26, 2015.|$|R
5000|$|The Justices then {{considered}} whether <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> justified {{under section}} 1. They dismissed {{the argument that}} <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> not prescribed by law. A law only needed to have an [...] "intelligible standard" [...] which <b>the</b> Quebec <b>law</b> satisfied.|$|R

5|$|Laws {{should be}} {{relatively}} stable and not changed too often, as with frequently changing laws {{it may be}} hard for people to keep themselves updated. People need to know what <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> both for short- and long-term planning.|$|E
5|$|Some {{commentators}} do {{not believe}} that the compliance pyramid applies when legitimate differences of views exist as to compliant behaviour. Regulators all need to establish their positions in this situation, but it is clear that some regulators do still apply the compliance pyramid when <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> uncertain.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> widely disregarded by motorists, {{even after}} the {{national}} maximum was increased to [...] on certain roads in 1987 and 1988. In 1995, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> repealed, returning <b>the</b> choice of speed limit to each state.|$|R

5|$|Compliance with <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> checked when {{vehicles}} {{pass through}} a weigh station, often located at the borders between states or {{on the outskirts of}} major cities, where the vehicle may be weighed and measured. The one exception to the formula allows a standard five-axle semi-truck configuration to weigh the maximum legal gross weight. This exception was specifically requested by the American Trucking Associations to allow tank trucks to reach the maximum legal gross weight without violating the bridge formula law.|$|E
5|$|Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion, which held that §8772 does not infringe on {{the separation of}} powers between the legislative and judicial branches of government, considering also that <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> an exercise of congressional authority regarding foreign affairs. Justice Anthony Kennedy, Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Stephen Breyer, Justice Samuel Alito, and Justice Elena Kagan joined the majority opinion (however, Justice Thomas did not join as to Part II-C of the opinion).|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> passed {{against one}} {{vote by the}} National Assembly in July 2010 and {{unanimously}} by the Senate in September 2010. The Constitutional Council who considered <b>the</b> <b>law</b> found {{that it did not}} violate the French constitution and <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> adopted on 11 October 2010.|$|R

5|$|Romania {{has a large}} {{population}} of wolves, numbering 2,500 animals. The wolf has been a protected animal in Romania since 1996, although <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> not enforced. The number of wolves in Albania and Macedonia is largely unknown, despite the importance the two countries have in linking wolf populations from Greece to those of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. Although protected, sometimes wolves are still illegally killed in Greece, and their future is uncertain. Wolf numbers have declined in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1986, while the species is fully protected in neighbouring Croatia and Slovenia.|$|E
5|$|Scalia doesn't {{come into}} oral {{argument}} all secretive and sphinxlike, feigning indecision on {{the nuances of}} the case before him. He comes in like a medieval knight, girded for battle. He knows what <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is.</b> He knows what the opinion should say. And he uses the hour allocated for argument to bludgeon his brethren into agreement.|$|E
5|$|The {{applicability}} {{of state and}} municipal alcohol laws on federal lands is a complex and partially unresolved legal issue that depends on whether the federal property is considered a federal enclave, what rights the state reserved when it granted the property to the federal government, and whether <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> criminal or civil. If the federal property is not an enclave, the federal government either has concurrent jurisdiction (shared authority with the state) or proprietary jurisdiction (only the rights of a landowner), and the state can enforce alcohol laws.|$|E
5000|$|The party’s {{manifesto}} states: “This is an infamous epoch because <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>are</b> used {{to create}} injustice; it is a disastrous epoch because <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>are</b> used to subdue, frighten and eliminate the people who protest and who demand justice.” ...|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Law</b> <b>was</b> then {{examined}} by the Senate between 23 February and 5 March, at which date the Senate approved it. Since the texts from the Assembly and the Senate <b>were</b> different, and <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> deemed urgent by the Prime Minister, the bill was sent before a mixed Assembly/Senate commission charged with the drafting of a compromise text. <b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> then adopted on 8 March by the Assembly, and on 9 March by the Senate.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> zeroth <b>law</b> <b>is</b> of {{importance}} in thermometry, because it implies {{the existence of}} temperature scales. In practice, C is a thermometer, and <b>the</b> zeroth <b>law</b> says that systems that are in thermodynamic equilibrium with each other have the same temperature. <b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> actually <b>the</b> last of <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> to <b>be</b> formulated.|$|R
5|$|Equality under Article 12(1) {{does not}} require that all persons are treated alike, but rather that all persons in like {{situations}} should be treated alike. Similarly, failing to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different also amounts to inequality. As such, at the second stage the question to be considered is whether persons falling within the same class are treated equally. Article 12(1) prohibits laws which require that some individuals within a single class should be treated more harshly than others. However, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> not unconstitutional if all persons discriminated against are equally discriminated against, and all persons not discriminated against are equally not discriminated against. The courts have found this stage to be satisfied where under a statute all citizens are equally liable to prosecution, whereas all non-citizens are equally immune from it. The second stage test was also found to have been satisfied where {{all members of the}} Singapore Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses found to have been in violation of the Societies Act were treated equally.|$|E
5|$|Even if a {{differentiating}} {{measure is}} found, {{there is a}} strong presumption that it is constitutional. The legislature must necessarily have a wide power of classification in making laws that operate differently for different groups of people in order to give effect to its policy. Unless <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> plainly arbitrary, suggesting examples of arbitrariness are not ordinarily helpful in rebutting this presumption of constitutionality. It is presumed that Parliament knows best for its people, and is experienced in making laws directed at societal problems, hence its differentiation is based on adequate grounds. Therefore, to rebut this presumption it is necessary for the person challenging the law to adduce some material or factual evidence to show that it was enacted arbitrarily or had operated arbitrarily.|$|E
5|$|If an {{employee}} does {{make such a}} disclosure, Section 2 inserts a new Section 47B, providing that the employee shall suffer no detriment in their employment as a result. This includes both negative actions {{and the absence of}} action, and as such covers discipline, dismissal, or failing to gain a pay rise or access to facilities which would otherwise have been provided. If {{an employee}} does suffer a detriment, he is permitted to make a complaint before an employment tribunal under Section 3. In front of an employment tribunal, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> amended in Sections 4 and 5 to provide compensation, and to reverse the burden of proof; if an employee has been dismissed for making a protected disclosure, this dismissal is automatically considered unfair. Similarly, under Section 6, an employee cannot be given priority when discussing redundancies simply because he made such a disclosure. These sections take into account Section 7, which notes that there is no requirement of age or length of employment before they come into effect.|$|E
25|$|Because {{opposition}} {{members of}} the Assembly and the Senate requested constitutional review of <b>the</b> text, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> sent before <b>the</b> Constitutional Council. The Council considered <b>the</b> <b>law</b> constitutional, but {{made a number of}} reservations, on 30 March. Those reservations impose guidelines under which <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> to be applied.|$|R

50|$|The instigators of <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> two lawspeakers of the Alþingi and the Danish King's {{representative}} in Iceland, Páll Stígsson. The King confirmed <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> in <b>the</b> following year. Iceland had recently adopted Lutheranism, and <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>were</b> enacted to reduce moral licentiousness and sexual lasciviousness in the country.|$|R
5|$|In this stage, it is {{necessary}} to inquire into, firstly, the object of the statute, and secondly, whether the basis of differentiation against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object. The essence of the test is whether it is reasonable, taking into consideration the object of the statute, to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of differentiation. As such, it {{is necessary}} to ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers the object of the statute. <b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved, and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional.|$|E
5|$|It Is <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> <b>is</b> a 1924 American silent mystery film {{directed}} by J. Gordon Edwards and starring Arthur Hohl, Herbert Hayes, and Mona Palma. It {{is a film}} adaptation of the eponymous 1922 Broadway play by Elmer Rice, itself based on a novel by Hayden Talbot. The film depicts the story of Ruth Allen (Palma), who marries Justin Victor (Heyes) over competing suitor Albert Woodruff (Hohl). Seeking revenge for this slight, Woodruff fakes his death by killing a drifter who resembles him, and frames Victor for the murder. When Woodruff returns to court Allen under a new identity, she sees through his disguise. Once Victor is freed from prison, he kills Woodruff, and goes free because a conviction would constitute double jeopardy.|$|E
5|$|Other flags {{used in the}} People's Republic of China use a red {{background}} to symbolize the revolution {{in conjunction with other}} symbols. The flag of the People's Liberation Army uses the gold star with the Chinese characters 8-1 (for 1 August, the date of the PLA's founding). The flag of the Communist Party of China replaces all of the stars with the party emblem. Due to government regulations, cities and provinces of China cannot have their own flags; the only sub-national flags that exist are those of the Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Regions. Despite this, at least two cities have adopted flags after the law was passed. The cities of Kaifeng and Shangrao adopted their flags in March 2006 and March 2009 respectively. This implies that <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> either repealed or not enforced.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Intrafamily Violence <b>Law</b> {{passed in}} 1994 {{was the first}} {{political}} measure to address violence in the home, but because <b>the</b> <b>law</b> would not pass without being accepted by both sides, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> weak in <b>the</b> way it addressed victim protection and punishment for abusers. <b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> later reformed in 2005.|$|R
