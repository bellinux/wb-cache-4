5|$|Church members {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>Father</b> Feit's confession line {{moved slowly}} {{that night and}} that he was away from the sanctuary several times. When the canal at the crime scene was drained several days after the discovery of Garza's body, Feit's photo slide viewer was found in the canal. Fellow priests noticed scratch marks on Feit's hands after midnight mass, and they said it was irregular for Feit to have taken Garza to the church rectory to hear her confession. The McAllen Police Department initially said that Feit passed polygraph tests, but the tests were later said to be inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|At the apartment, Father John and Lloyd find Linda {{has moved}} out, but they {{discover}} she had possessed a 12-year-old newspaper clipping about Father John's ordination. Father John offers Lloyd a job helping {{out at the}} church, which Lloyd accepts. Father John then returns to his church and cries, fearing he {{is too late to}} save Linda. Meanwhile, Linda goes to a bridge and is about to jump off when she encounters Gus, who offers her the rosary he received earlier from Father John. A grateful and emotional Linda hugs Gus. It is not revealed whether she commits suicide or not. In a confession to Father Ralph, Father John expresses guilt he did not absolve Linda before her confession abruptly ended. Father Ralph says that even if Linda is dead, her soul is immortal, and <b>that</b> <b>Father</b> John's penance is to absolve her now. Father John does so. The film ends with a childhood memory of young Linda at church, where a group of boys laugh at her old torn clothes until she is defended by a young John Buerlein, whose act seems to make a strong positive impact upon her.|$|E
5|$|Three {{weeks before}} Garza's death, {{a woman named}} Maria America Guerra had been sexually {{assaulted}} while kneeling at the communion rail at another Catholic church in the area. Rumor held <b>that</b> <b>Father</b> Feit was responsible, but local church leaders discouraged people from considering {{the possibility that a}} priest could have been involved in a violent crime. Feit admitted to visiting a priest at that church on the day of Guerra's attack, but he denied assaulting her. He was later charged with rape, and the trial ended in a hung jury. In 1962, rather than facing a second trial, Feit entered a plea of no contest to a misdemeanor charge of aggravated assault, and he paid a $500 fine. Years later, Feit said he did not understand that a no contest plea would result in his conviction.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates memorable {{messages}} that {{sons and daughters}} report receiving from their fathers or step-fathers while actively or passively participating within the environment of sports together. The premise {{was to examine the}} messages <b>that</b> <b>fathers</b> use with children and how this may relate to the relationship satisfaction of the sons and daughters later in life. Also of interest, is the comparison of messages <b>that</b> <b>fathers</b> share with sons and daughters. Findings from the study indicate <b>that</b> <b>fathers</b> share messages with sons and daughters centered on five supra-types including Effort, Quality Traits, Emphasis on Physical Skills/Performance, Attention on Others and Have Fun. A chi-square analysis was used to determine <b>that</b> <b>fathers</b> share similar messages with sons and daughters, while ANOVA test results point to a significant relationship between certain types of memorable messages offered by fathers when compared with the relationship satisfaction reported by sons and daughters later in life...|$|R
40|$|This {{literature}} review draws {{from a wide}} array of interdisciplinary research to argue <b>that</b> <b>fathers</b> need to be included in child welfare practice and research to the same extent as mothers. Social work and child maltreatment literature highlight <b>that</b> <b>fathers</b> are often overlooked and viewed more negatively than mothers in child welfare practice. There are noteworthy theoretical and practical reasons for this poor engagement of fathers in practice. However, advances in attachment theory and recent research findings from developmental and <b>fathering</b> literature indicate <b>that</b> <b>fathers</b> influence their children independently from mothers and equally strongly. Further research demonstrates <b>that</b> <b>fathers</b> and father figures can be both potential risk factors and protective factors in the lives of vulnerable children. Therefore, children are placed at increased risk if dangerous fathers are not engaged, and are also significantly disadvantaged if supportive fathers are not engaged. The review concludes with practical implications for child welfare practice and research. 16 page(s...|$|R

Research conducted by Malamuth found that men raised in the absence of their father (or where resources were scarce) reported more use of sexual coercion in the past, and were more likely to indicate being more willing to rape, in the event that there was no chance of them getting caught. Research has also found that parental divorce and rape correlate positively.|$|E

40|$|Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA), {{including}} sport participation, is {{an important}} component of a healthy lifestyle. Scholars have devoted considerable attention to understanding the impact of parenthood on MVPA, albeit only for women. As the impact of fatherhood on men's lives is drawing more and more scholarly and societal attention, the aim of the current article is to provide an systematic overview of studies examining the impact of fatherhood on MVPA. A systematic review was conducted in Google Scholar, Web of Science and Web of Knowledge, using (combinations of) the search terms: father(hood), parent(hood), exercise, physical activity, sport and leisure time. This resulted in 54 papers reporting differences in MVPA and/or sport between fathers and childless men or within men <b>that</b> became <b>father,</b> of which 13 were included. Our overview of findings suggested <b>that</b> <b>fathers</b> spent less time on MVPA compared with childless men, but <b>that</b> <b>fathers</b> did not differ from their childless counterparts on the subarea of sport participation. Differences in time spent on MVPA were strongest between childless men and fathers with young children (< 6 Â yrs). Our systematic review revealed <b>that</b> <b>fathers</b> spent less time on MVPA compared to childless men, especially when they had young children. Interestingly, linkages between parental status and the subarea of sport participation were not found, which suggests <b>that</b> <b>fathers</b> cut back on other areas of MVPA. Given the impact of MVPA on a healthy lifestyle, future research in this field is warranted...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the paternal attitudes and the effect of theindividual characteristic on the paternal attitude of the fathers whose 5 - 6 years old children attendpreschool education. This research was conducted on 285 fathers whose children attendpreschool education. To gather data, âParental Attitude Scale-Father Formâ was applied to thefathers. The data were analised by using F test, t test and Tukey test. According to the researchfindings, it is observed that the age, level of education and the number of children fathers haveaffect their interest in fatherhood, while their age of first fatherhood affects their perception ofefficiency, their satisfaction and general attitude, and their level of education affects theirperception of efficiency and general attitude. When it is considered <b>that</b> <b>fathers</b> influence manyaspects of a childâs development, it is of great significance <b>that</b> <b>fathers</b> have a positive attitudetowards fatherhood.

25|$|I {{have been}} a Catholic and an infidel; I {{have been a}} Roman priest and a hypocrite; I have been a profligate under a cowl.

I am he, who afterwards was found guilty of sins, similar or worse, in other towns of the neighbourhood. I am that son of St. Dominic who is known to have repeated the offence at Capua, in 1834 or 1835; and at Naples again, in 1840, in the case of a child of fiteen. I am he who chose the sacristy of the church for one of these crimes, and Good Friday for another.

I am that Professor of the Protestant College at Malta, who with two others was dismissed from my post for offences which the authorities cannot get themselves to describe.
