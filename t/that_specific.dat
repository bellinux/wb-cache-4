Free throw, court, half court, three pointer, and point guard are all terms <b>that</b> are <b>specific</b> to the sport of basketball. These words make very little sense when used outside of the semantic domain of basketball.|$|R

5|$|Both {{medications}} and neurorehabilitation {{have been shown}} to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease. Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as an unstable bladder and spasticity, while others are little changed. For neurologic problems, a multidisciplinary approach is important for improving quality of life; however, it is difficult to specify a 'core team' as many health services may be needed at different points in time. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs increase activity and participation of people with MS but do not influence impairment level. There is limited evidence for the overall efficacy of individual therapeutic disciplines, though there is good evidence <b>that</b> <b>specific</b> approaches, such as exercise, and psychology therapies, in particular cognitive behavioral approaches are effective.|$|E

5|$|British {{archaeologist}} and anthropologist Katherine Routledge {{undertook a}} 1914–1915 scientific expedition to Rapa Nui {{with her husband}} to catalog the art, customs, and writing of the island. She was able to interview two elderly informants, Kapiera and a leper named Tomenika, who allegedly had some knowledge of rongorongo. The sessions were not very fruitful, as the two often contradicted each other. From them Routledge concluded that rongorongo was an idiosyncratic mnemonic device that did not directly represent language, in other words, proto-writing, and that the meanings of the glyphs were reformulated by each scribe, so that the kohau rongorongo could not be read by someone not trained in <b>that</b> <b>specific</b> text. The texts themselves she believed to be litanies for priest-scribes, kept apart in special houses and strictly tapu, that recorded the island's history and mythology. By the time of later ethnographic accounts, such as Métraux (1940), much of what Routledge recorded in her notes had been forgotten, and the oral history showed a strong external influence from popular published accounts.|$|E
5|$|Evolution {{also does}} not require that organisms become more complex. Although the history of life shows an {{apparent}} trend towards the evolution of biological complexity; {{there is a question}} if this appearance of increased complexity is real, or if it comes from neglecting the fact that the majority of life on Earth has always consisted of prokaryotes. In this view, complexity is not a necessary consequence of evolution, but <b>that</b> <b>specific</b> circumstances of evolution on Earth frequently made greater complexity advantageous and thus naturally selected for. Depending on the situation, organisms' complexity can either increase, decrease, or stay the same, and all three of these trends have been observed in evolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{cardinals}} hear two sermons {{before the}} election: one before actually entering the conclave, and one {{once they are}} settled in the Sistine Chapel. In both cases, the sermons are meant {{to lay out the}} current state of the Church, and to suggest the qualities necessary for a pope to possess in <b>that</b> <b>specific</b> time. The first preacher in the 2005 conclave was Fr. Raniero Cantalamessa, the preacher of the papal household and a member of the Capuchin Franciscan order, who spoke at one of the meetings of the cardinals held before the actual day when the conclave began. Cardinal Tomáš Špidlík, a former professor at the Pontifical Oriental Institute and a non-voting member (due to age) of the College of Cardinals, spoke just before the doors were finally closed for the conclave.|$|E

5|$|The {{last two}} manuscripts {{containing}} the story are MS. XXXVI in the National Library of Scotland and H.6.8 in Trinity College, Dublin, written 1690–1691 and c. 1777 respectively. These represent a modernisation {{of the story}} that might {{have been made in the}} 15th or 16th century. The two manuscripts differ from each other in some respects, and the spelling is very poor. William J. Watson notes that the text of MS. XXXVI was based on the redaction contained in Rawlinson B 512, but not upon <b>that</b> <b>specific</b> manuscript. The changes are so considerable in these modernisations that they are of no value for reconstructing the original text.|$|E
5|$|They are {{responsible}} for pollination of approximately {{one third of the}} United States' crop species, including such species as almonds, peaches, apples, pears, cherries, raspberries, blackberries, cranberries, watermelons, cantaloupes, cucumbers, and strawberries. Many, but not all, of these plants can be (and often are) pollinated by other insects in the U.S., including other kinds of bees (e.g., squash bees on cucurbits), but typically not on a commercial scale. While some farmers of a few kinds of native crops do bring in honey bees to help pollinate, none specifically need them, and when honey bees are absent from a region, there is a presumption that native pollinators may reclaim the niche, typically being better adapted to serve those plants (assuming that the plants normally occur in <b>that</b> <b>specific</b> area).|$|E
5|$|Every {{game in the}} SmackDown vs. Raw series used to {{have the}} amount of damage inflicted to the player's chosen superstar, {{measured}} with a meter on the HUD, where a design of a male figure presented the damage. As a move was performed against a superstar, the affected area of the body flashed—the more damage that is done to <b>that</b> <b>specific</b> body part, {{the more likely it}} is for the superstar to submit. Colors were used to represent the amount of damage done to a specific body area; yellow represented minimal damage, orange represented moderate damage, and red represented maximum damage. This was however taken out of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010. Now the only way to tell how damaged the opponent is to watch their physical body actions that indicate how hurt they are. The more damage inflicted to opponents, {{the more likely it is}} for them to lose the match. There are four ways to win a match in every game: by pinfall, submission, knockout, countout; alternatively, the match could end in a draw. With the introduction of an on-screen referee in WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It, the ability to win by disqualification was also included.|$|E
