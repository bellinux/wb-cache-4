5|$|A second cruise saw {{the capture}} of an American privateer, and a notable {{incident}} for Nelson. Lowestoffe sent her boat and first lieutenant {{to take over the}} prize, but the seas were <b>too</b> <b>rough</b> to allow the American to be boarded, so the lieutenant returned. Nelson stepped forward and volunteered to make an attempt; he succeeded.|$|E
5|$|The {{bombardment}} {{was scheduled}} to cease immediately before the assault companies deployed on Juno, but due to heavy seas, the landing was delayed by ten minutes, to 07:45 in Mike sector and 07:55 in Nan Sector. This was at a slightly higher tide, closer to the beach obstacles and mines. The LCTs carrying the field artillery were forced to adjust course to avoid landing too early; the LCTs carrying DD tanks were forced to break off their advance. The seas proved <b>too</b> <b>rough</b> to launch the DD tanks, so they were ordered to deploy from the LCTs several hundred yards out from the beach.|$|E
5|$|The calcium {{carbonate}} or silica spicules of most sponge genera make them <b>too</b> <b>rough</b> for most uses, but two genera, Hippospongia and Spongia, have soft, entirely fibrous skeletons. Early Europeans used soft sponges for many purposes, including padding for helmets, portable drinking utensils and municipal water filters. Until {{the invention of}} synthetic sponges, they were used as cleaning tools, applicators for paints and ceramic glazes and discreet contraceptives. However, by the mid-20th century, over-fishing brought both the animals and the industry close to extinction.|$|E

5|$|On December 11, 1905, {{before the}} start of the 1905–06 season, Stuart was {{suspended}} from the league after the western teams complained that he had won too many championships and was <b>too</b> <b>rough</b> for the league. He was reinstated by the league on December 30, and joined the Pittsburgh Professionals. After Pittsburgh finished their season, Stuart joined Calumet for one game so they could try to win the league championship, which they lost to the Portage Lakes Hockey Club. Once again he was named best cover-point in the IPHL as he scored eleven goals. A big man with a fluid skating stride, he was considered the finest defenceman of his era for his outstanding play on both offence and defence.|$|E
5|$|The {{four hours}} passed with no reply, and Salvori began formulating his {{plan of attack}} against Tripoli. Though the Sardinian {{commander}} had initially wished to use his squadron's frigates in {{the assault on the}} city, the seas were <b>too</b> <b>rough</b> to ensure their safety close to shore, so he instead made plans to attack Tripoli using several boats from his squadron's vessels. Sivori placed 260 men in ten boats separated into three divisions under the command of Commercios Lieutenant Giorgio Mamelli. One division would attack the Tripolitanian brig, another the schooners, and the third group of boats would assault the city's dockyard and customs house to ensure no reinforcements could enter the harbor.|$|E
5|$|By October 1915 Campania had {{exercised}} {{with the}} Grand Fleet seven times, but had only flown off aircraft {{three times as}} the North Sea was often <b>too</b> <b>rough</b> for her seaplanes to use. Her captain recommended that the flying-off deck be lengthened and given a steeper slope to allow gravity to boost the aircraft's acceleration and the ship was accordingly modified at Cammell Laird between November 1915 and early April 1916. The forward funnel was split into two funnels and the flight deck was extended between them and over the bridge to a length of , so that aircraft from both holds could use the flight deck. A canvas windscreen was provided to allow the aircraft to unfold their wings out of the wind, and a kite balloon {{and all of its}} supporting equipment were added in the aft hold. Campania now carried seven Short Type 184 torpedo bombers and three or four smaller fighters or scouts; a Type 184 made its first takeoff from the flight deck on 3 June 1916, also using a wheeled trolley. This success prompted the Admiralty to order the world's first aircraft designed for carrier operations, the Fairey Campania. The ship received the first of these aircraft in late 1917 where they joined smaller Sopwith 1½ Strutter scouts. At various times Campania also carried the Sopwith Baby and Sopwith Pup.|$|E
25|$|In his mid-20s, Dost Mohammad Khan {{was engaged}} to Mehraj Bibi, an {{attractive}} girl from a neighboring Orakzai clan. However, Mehraj was later betrothed to his cousin, because Khan's character was seen as <b>too</b> aggressive and <b>rough.</b> An angry Khan killed his cousin, leading to his ostracism from his family.|$|R

But they make a mistake in intimidating and underestimating Ira, who ends up paying Lamar back in kind as well as tracking down Birdwell's missing wife.|$|R
60|$|Rollo's {{father and}} mother, and his uncle George, walked along behind them. The way was, for some distance, {{a sort of}} cart-path, <b>too</b> steep and <b>rough</b> for a chaise, but hard and dry, and pretty {{comfortable}} walking. Rollo and Lucy asked Jonas if he would not tell them a story, as they went along, to beguile the way.|$|R
25|$|As soon as Bakari was sighted, {{a member}} of the rescue team threw her a life preserver, but the waters were <b>too</b> <b>rough,</b> and she was too {{exhausted}} to grab it. One of the sailors, Maturaffi Sélémane Libounah, jumped into the water and handed her a flotation device, after which they were both pulled safely aboard the Sima Com 2, where she was given dry blankets and a hot drink.|$|E
25|$|In early May, Fugro Supporter {{withdrew from}} the {{underwater}} search and offloaded its AUV in Fremantle. Sea conditions during the austral winter are <b>too</b> <b>rough</b> to safely launch and recover the AUV and therefore, AUV operations will be suspended during the winter months. However, the AUV will be kept ready to assist the search at short notice. On 20 June, GO Phoenix left the search area to begin passage to Singapore, {{where it will be}} demobilized from search activities.|$|E
25|$|The Gators {{arrived in}} Jacksonville with a 3-2 record and an offense {{which had not}} {{performed}} well against good defenses. To jump start the Gators' attack, Coach Woodruff moved quarterback Rick Casares to fullback and inserted running back Doug Dickey into the quarterback position for the game. Casares had been recruited by Georgia but thought that Bulldog Coach Wally Butts was <b>too</b> <b>rough</b> with his players during a recruiting visit, so he opted to attend Florida instead.|$|E

5000|$|The tournament {{included}} test match debuts {{for both}} Barbados and St Vincent - and for both {{it was a}} painful introduction to the game. Barbados were blown away by the Caymans in their opening game - the visitors being [...] "just <b>too</b> big and <b>rough</b> for Barbados' young inexperienced side" [...] while their second game ended early due to injury.|$|R
50|$|There {{is more of}} a {{concentration}} on the early period, with a much smaller amount from selected '50's and '60's LP's. This was done in part because many of the early Atkins songs appreciated by collectors were out of print and unavailable. Atkins had been reluctant to see this material reissued during his lifetime, because he felt his early playing <b>too</b> brash and <b>rough.</b>|$|R
25|$|The station's {{surviving}} {{facilities are}} part of Salem's Winter Island Marine Park. Salem Harbor was deep enough to host a seadrome with three sea lanes, offering a variety of take-off headings irrespective of wind direction unless {{there was a strong}} steady wind from the east. This produced large waves that swept into the mouth of the harbor, making water operations difficult. When the seadrome was <b>too</b> <b>rough,</b> returning amphibian aircraft would use Naval Auxiliary Air Facility Beverly. Salem Air Station moved to Cape Cod in 1970.|$|E
25|$|Air-sea rescue {{by flying}} boat or {{floatplane}} was a method used by various nations before World War II {{to pick up}} aviators or sailors who were struggling in the water. Training and weather accidents could require an aircrew to be pulled from the water, and seaplanes were occasionally used for that purpose. The limitation was that if the water's surface were <b>too</b> <b>rough,</b> the aircraft {{would not be able}} to land. The most that could be done was to drop emergency supplies to the survivors.|$|E
25|$|Major General H. J. Macandrew {{commanding}} 5th Cavalry Division, sent Captain R. H. M. McIntyre commanding 7th Light Car Patrol under a {{flag of truce}} with {{a demand}} for the surrender Aleppo, which was rejected by Mustapha Kemal. Subsequently, the armoured cars attempted a reconnaissance in a northwesterly direction {{looking for a way}} through the rocky hills to the southwest of Aleppo, towards the Alexandretta road. The country was found to be <b>too</b> <b>rough</b> for cars and they withdrew back to Khan Tuman to bivouac.|$|E
50|$|In 1958, Lamborghini {{traveled}} to Maranello {{to buy a}} Ferrari 250GT, a two-seat coupé with a body designed by coachbuilder Pininfarina. He went on to own several more over the years, including a Scaglietti-designed 250 SWB Berlinetta and a 250GT 2+2 four-seater. Lamborghini thought Ferrari's cars were good, but <b>too</b> noisy and <b>rough</b> to be proper road cars, categorizing them as repurposed track cars with poorly built interiors.|$|R
50|$|Allen was {{formally}} appointed as umpire {{for the challenge}} final on Wednesday, 14 September, with no objections from the Richmond delegate present at the appointment. During the week, Allen personally received a sarcastic letter from Richmond secretary, Mr Peckham-Beachcroft, in which was enclosed a book of rules; this letter was submitted by Allen to an Association general meeting on Saturday 17 September. On Tuesday, 20 September, the Association first received correspondence from Richmond regarding its complaint against Allen's handling of the boot inspection in the semi-final; the letter was dated Tuesday 13 September. On Saturday 26 September, Allen umpired the semi-final between Footscray and North Melbourne, and attracted heavy criticism for keeping poor control over the game, allowing <b>too</b> much <b>rough</b> play, and permitting North Melbourne to engage in persistent time-wasting tactics.|$|R
5|$|A two-minute minor {{penalty is}} often called for lesser infractions such as slashing, tripping, elbowing, <b>roughing,</b> <b>too</b> many players, illegal equipment, holding, or interference. Five-minute major {{penalties}} are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent, {{as well as for}} fighting. Players are released from the penalty box when either the penalty time expires, or the opposition scores a goal (or three goals for the instance of a major penalty).|$|R
25|$|Four years later, on 19 March 1891, the barque Compadre was {{overwhelmed}} by fire on board. With seas <b>too</b> <b>rough</b> to launch boats, the barque was driven onto the rocks off the North Cape of Auckland Island. All of the 17 crew members made it ashore, although one of them later died. They obtained relief and sustenance from two nearby depots, supplemented by livestock that had been released onto the island, and survived in comparatively good health until rescued 122 days later by the sealing schooner Janet Ramsay on 30 June, and carried to Bluff.|$|E
25|$|Hart grew up {{in central}} Tasmania with an older brother, Lance and two younger sisters, Gayle and Cheryl. He gravitated toward sports, in {{particular}} Australian football, which upset his mother, who thought the game <b>too</b> <b>rough.</b> Hart was educated at Clarence High School and participated in football and athletics. He played as a rover in the Tasmanian under-15 schoolboys team before his growth spurt, and held a junior high-jumping record for about 20 years. Playing on the ball helped develop his ground skills, but {{he was able to}} exert greater presence on the field after his growth spurt.|$|E
25|$|Maund {{was most}} {{pleased with the}} {{efficiency}} with which the Legionnaires disembarked from the LCA. The small flotilla of LCAs, MLCs, and an LCM (Mk. I) had added greatly to the Allies' tactical latitude. No LCAs were lost to enemy action during these operations in Norway. One craft was lost, sometime before 27 May, being burned out by accident while lying up on the east shore of the Herjangsfjord. The three LCAs surviving could not be hoisted on available ships when {{the decision was made}} to evacuate. An attempt was made to tow them home behind trawlers, but the sea became <b>too</b> <b>rough</b> and the LCAs had to be cut adrift and sunk.|$|E

60|$|Upon finance I must {{note that}} the expense of {{travelling}} has mounted high. I am <b>too</b> old to <b>rough</b> it, and scrub it, nor could I have saved fifty pounds by doing so. I have gained, however, in health, spirits, in a new stock of ideas, new combinations, and new views. My self-consequence is raised, I hope not unduly, by the many flattering circumstances attending my reception in the two capitals, and I feel confident in proportion. In Scotland I shall find time for labour and for economy.|$|R
40|$|The writer proposes {{the fact}} that {{children}} who have a conflict with the law frequently suffer bad treatment from the justice officers. Despite no bad treatment received, the ordinary criminal justice system seems <b>too</b> tough and <b>rough</b> to children. In {{order to reduce the}} unnecessary effect toward children who have a conflict with the law, the writer advises the justice officers to provide more room for diversion, an extra legal effort to reach just settlement. However, the writer also reminds us that there are several problems unresolved concerning the maximum implementation of diversionary idea...|$|R
25|$|Penguin had {{one more}} notable action under Pulling's command. On 21 August she saw two vessels sailing towards her. They were flying the English flag, but then {{revealed}} themselves to be French. Within half-an-hour of an exchange of fire the rearmost struck. However, the seas were <b>too</b> <b>rough</b> for Pulling to take possession, and the other vessel was larger, so Pulling set off after her. A running fight lasting one hour and 40 minutes ensued before the second French vessel struck. She {{turned out to be}} the French privateer corvette Oiseau, pierced for 20 guns but carrying sixteen 9-pounder guns and two long French 12-pounder guns. She had a crew of 119 men, of whom one was killed and five wounded in the pursuit.|$|E
25|$|At 15:00 the 3rd Light Horse Brigade {{moved off}} with the {{remainder}} of the Australian Mounted Division following at 17:00. As advanced guard the 9th Light Horse Regiment with six machine guns attached, pushed forward one squadron with two machine guns which encountered the strong Ottoman position. Supported by machine guns and well sited artillery and situated on rising ground covered with boulders, their left flank was secured by a rough lava formation. By 19:00 {{the remainder of the}} 3rd Light Horse Brigade, seeing the advanced squadron being shelled by at least one battery, was moving forward to the right to attack the Ottoman left flank. The 10th Light Horse Regiment was sent forward in support to attack the right flank. However the country either side of the road was <b>too</b> <b>rough</b> for the cavalry to advance across during the night and machine gun fire swept the road. The strong rearguard had stopped the pursuit.|$|E
25|$|On 24 November 1642 Abel Tasman {{reached and}} sighted {{the west coast}} of Tasmania, north of Macquarie Harbour. He named his {{discovery}} Van Diemen's Land after Antonio van Diemen, Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. Proceeding south he skirted the southern end of Tasmania and turned north-east. Tasman then tried to work his two ships into Adventure Bay on the east coast of South Bruny Island where he was blown out to sea by a storm. This area he named Storm Bay. Two days later Tasman anchored to the north of Cape Frederick Hendrick just north of the Forestier Peninsula. Tasman then landed in Blackman Bay – in the larger Marion Bay. The next day, an attempt was made to land in North Bay. However, because the sea was <b>too</b> <b>rough</b> the carpenter swam through the surf and planted the Dutch flag. Tasman then claimed formal possession of the land on 3 December 1642.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{the third}} panel, after {{the last of his}} bodyguards fell (left foreground), the king escaped alone to a rocky place, where he was {{apparently}} reached by a Roman trooper who had dismounted and was leading his horse on foot, presumably because the terrain was <b>too</b> steep or <b>rough</b> to ride (right foreground). This trooper may represent Maximus, given his role as scout-leader. An alternative view, supported by Speidel, is that the mounted trooper shown nearest to Decebalus was Maximus, as this figure appears replicated in Maximus' own funerary monument.|$|R
2500|$|Windy Gap (2,460ft) {{stands a}} little way to the south west of the summit, {{at the bottom of}} a stony slope. On the Ennerdale side is Stone Cove- not named by chance, they are yards deep- while the south eastern descent leads down Aaron Slack. [...] "Slack" [...] is the dialect word for scree, and this <b>too</b> is a <b>rough</b> chute leading down to Sty Head Pass. Sty Head Tarn lies at the bottom of the Slack, a large pool in a scooped out hollow, the outlet blocked by boulders. It is 30ft deep and reputed to contain trout.|$|R
60|$|Colonel Mar made a {{magnificent}} bow, carelessly, {{not to say}} impertinently, scanned the two ladies, and having evidently decided they had neither beauty nor fashion to attract him, caught up little Amy in his arms, and began to play a half teasing, half caressing game with the children. Betty thought it high time to be gone, and as she took leave, was requested to send up her little brother to play with his cousins. This did not prove a success, for Eugene constituted himself champion to Amoret, of whom Archer was very jealous, though she was his devoted and submissive slave. Master Delavie's rustic ways were in consequence pronounced to be <b>too</b> rude and <b>rough</b> for the dainty little town-bred boy, the fine ladies' pet.|$|R
