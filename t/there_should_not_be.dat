5|$|The Mittal Steel company {{purchased}} the Omarska mining complex {{and planned to}} resume extraction of iron ore from the site. Mittal Steel announced in Banja Luka on 1 December 2005 that the company would build and finance a memorial in the 'White House' but the project was later abandoned. Many Bosnian Serbs believe <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> a memorial, while many Bosniaks believe that construction should be postponed until all the victims are found and only if the entire mine—which is in use—be allocated for the memorial site.|$|E
5|$|At {{present in}} the United States there are three {{different}} levels of scrutiny. Firstly, if a law categorizes {{on the basis of}} race or national origin (which are regarded as suspect classifications), or infringes a fundamental right, strict scrutiny is applied. Accordingly, the law is unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. In addition, <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling interest. Secondly, if the law categorizes on the basis of gender, legitimacy or similar quasi-suspect classifications, intermediate scrutiny is applied – the law is unconstitutional unless it is substantially related to an important government interest. Finally, the traditional rational basis review is applied if the law categorizes on some other, non-suspect, basis. In this case, the law is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest.|$|E

25|$|The British {{government}} in London {{was not pleased}} with legislation that discriminated against certain subjects of its Empire, but decided not to disallow the laws that were passed.

25|$|The IITs had {{initially}} a quota system, but the quota system was scrapped and the modified scheme described below {{was introduced in}} 1983. This procedure was evolved based {{on the experience of}} implementing a quota system for ten years (1973–1983). The logic cited for this procedure is that IITs being Institutes of National Importance, <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> any compromise on the quality of students studying in them; accordingly, students admitted through the reserved quota have no relaxation in requirements for passing courses or getting the degree. They are, however, allowed to complete the program at a slower pace (take longer to get the degree).|$|E
25|$|During spring 2012, Jobbik {{representative}} in Hungarian parliament Zsolt Baráth caused an outrage by commemorating 1882 blood libel against the Jews in Parliament. The Tiszaeszlár blood libel, found later to be unrelated to Jews, {{was known as}} first major anti-Jewish event in modern Hungary, predating the Holocaust. The speech of Baráth caused controversy among Jobbik MPs: some - however finding it inappropriate and uncalled for - stated that in a matured democracy <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> taboo topics, while leaders of the Jobbik Parliamentary Group told the media that they had evaluated the speech and learnt the lesson that they should care more about what their MPs are talking. After the incident Baráth was not re-elected and is not an MP of Jobbik anymore.|$|E

There were many variants, which <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> according to the single-author conviction.

25|$|There are {{strict rules}} in the Tantra Shastra {{regarding}} the corpse. The corpse should be fresh and undamaged. No {{part of the body}} should be missing. <b>There</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> deformity in any part; e.g. a one-eyed corpse would be rejected. The Tantrasara specifies that corpse may be human (preferred) or animal. In humans, the most preferred (maha-shava, great corpse) are a chandala (a child of a Shudra father and a Brahmin mother; an outcaste and the lowest of the mixed castes) who died due to drowning, lightning-strike, snake-bite, injury, or was killed by a stick, sword, spear, or other weapon; and a courageous young man who died in battle while fighting his enemy. Specific animals are also recommended in the text.|$|E
25|$|In the Baltic, {{amidst the}} context of the Anglo-Swedish War, Dashwood {{received}} notice that the Swedes were fitting out eight sail of the line and five frigates at Karlskrona. The British consul in Sweden, a man named Smith, passed on to Dashwood a request from the Swedish government that those ships not be molested. Dashwood gave orders to his crew to respect the Swedish flag, and also informed Swedish Admiral Puke that <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> misunderstanding between the two nations, as war between the United Kingdom and Sweden existed only on paper. Early in the spring, he was sent with his squadron to provide protection to the island of Anholt, which was threatened by the Danes. No action followed, though, as the Danish attempt to occupy the island was abandoned on the appearance of Dashwood's fleet.|$|E
25|$|Initially, in May 2001, it {{was noted}} that since the opera house was a Heritage building, it could not be redeveloped but only restored. Even for restoration, funds needed to be found. With these two basic aspects in view, the {{planning}} dictum followed was that: The historicity of the building and its architecture will be lost if it is not used as a theatre and <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> a change of user. The initial plan proposed was to convert a part of the open plot to be developed commercially to generate funds, which could self sustain the expenditure involved in the restoration and maintenance of the existing heritage building. To proceed further with this plan, it was also considered essential to negotiate with the existing owner Maharaja Vikramsinghji Bhojraji of Gondal to get his consent to the incentive plan.|$|E

25|$|Before {{using the}} laser, the {{ophthalmologist}} dilates the pupil and applies anaesthetic drops to numb the eye. In some cases, the doctor also may numb the area behind {{the eye to}} reduce discomfort. The patient sits facing the laser machine while the doctor holds a special lens on the eye. The physician can use a single spot laser or a pattern scan laser for two dimensional patterns such as squares, rings and arcs. During the procedure, the patient will see flashes of light. These flashes often create an uncomfortable stinging sensation for the patient. After the laser treatment, patients should be advised not to drive {{for a few hours}} while the pupils are still dilated. Vision will most likely remain blurry {{for the rest of the}} day. Though <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> much pain in the eye itself, an ice-cream headache like pain may last for hours afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Metal toothed {{watertight}} zippers rely {{on pressure}} {{between the two}} rubberized contact surfaces of the zipper tapes alongside the teeth for sealing. To get this pressure, the slider needs to press the two faces together while closing, and this increases friction between the slider and the teeth, so the zipper requires more force to close than regular zippers. If the two rows of open teeth are lined up and close together {{in front of the}} pull it will prevent misalignment which can permanently damage the sealing edge, and allow the zipper to be closed with less effort. Friction can be reduced by suitable lubrication which is usually done with a waterproof wax or grease which remains on the zipper when wet. <b>There</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> an excessive buildup of lubricant which would stick to particles of grit and cause wear and additional friction. The plastic tooth zippers have less friction than the metal teeth and need less force to close.|$|E
25|$|In the Listening exam of 2007, {{there was}} a part asking {{students}} to determine whether marked sentences were correct or not, based on the whole recording. There were 10 questions, carrying 2 marks each. In that part, if a candidate answered a question correctly, 2 marks were awarded but if the question was answered, 2 marks were deducted. No marks were given or deducted for blank answers. A candidate who answered all the questions, {{with no more than}} 5 being correct, would end up having no marks for that section, but if 5 were correct, 10 marks were given. That stirred up controversy among candidates, who claimed that the marking scheme was not fair. They said that all questions were compulsory so <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> any advantage to those who left some of the blanks empty by deducting marks for wrong answers. The HKEAA said that it had been in practice for years to prevent students guessing answers, but in fact, this type of marking had appeared only in table-type questions in which candidates were required to tick some of the boxes in the table but not in questions in which all blanks were to be filled.|$|E
