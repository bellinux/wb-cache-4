2500|$|After his death, Handel's Italian operas {{fell into}} obscurity, except for {{selections}} {{such as the}} aria from Serse, [...] "Ombra mai fù". The oratorios continued to be performed but not long after Handel's death they were thought <b>to</b> <b>need</b> <b>some</b> modernisation, and Mozart orchestrated a German version of Messiah and other works. Throughout the 19th century and {{first half of the}} 20th century, particularly in the Anglophone countries, his reputation rested primarily on his English oratorios, which were customarily performed by choruses of amateur singers on solemn occasions. [...] The centenary of his death, in 1859, was celebrated by a performance of Messiah at The Crystal Palace, involving 2,765 singers and 460 instrumentalists, who played for an audience of about 10,000 people.|$|E

I had not seen her since that {{occasion}} when her claims were brought into comparison with those of Ginevra Fanshawe, and had so signally prevailed; she had much to tell me of her travels in the interval. A most animated, rapid speaker was she in such a tête-à-tête, a most lively describer; yet with her artless diction and clear soft voice, she never seemed to speak too fast or to say too much. My own attention I think would not soon have flagged, but by-and-by, she herself seemed <b>to</b> <b>need</b> <b>some</b> change of subject; she hastened to wind up her narrative briefly. Yet why she terminated with so concise an abridgment did not immediately appear; silence followed--a restless silence, not without symptoms of abstraction. Then, turning to me, in a diffident, half-appealing voice--"Lucy--" ...|$|E
60|$|The Town of Grand Tower {{was evidently}} a busier place {{than it had}} been in old times, but it seemed <b>to</b> <b>need</b> <b>some</b> repairs here and there, and a new coat of {{whitewash}} all over. Still, it was pleasant to me to see the old coat once more. 'Uncle' Mumford, our second officer, said the place had been suffering from high water, and consequently was not looking its best now. But he said it was not strange that it didn't waste white-wash on itself, for more lime was made there, and of a better quality, than anywhere in the West; and added--'On a dairy farm you never can get any milk for your coffee, nor any sugar for it on a sugar plantation; and it is against sense to go to a lime town to hunt for white-wash.' In my own experience I knew the first two items to be true; and also that people who sell candy don't care for candy; therefore there was plausibility in Uncle Mumford's final observation that 'people who make lime run more to religion than whitewash.' Uncle Mumford said, further, that Grand Tower was a great coaling center and a prospering place.|$|E
6000|$|This point seems <b>to</b> <b>need</b> <b>some</b> illustration. Suppose {{that all}} the [...] lands in a {{community}} are of five different grades of [...] productiveness. When the price of agricultural produce was such [...] that grades one, two, and three all came into cultivation, lands [...] of poorer quality would not be cultivated. When a man rents a [...] farm, he always gets land of varying degrees of fertility within [...] its limits. Now, in determining what he ought to pay as rent, the [...] farmer will agree to give that which will still leave him a profit [...] on his working capital; if in his fields he finds land which would [...] not enter into the question of rental, {{because it did not}} yield [...] more than the profit on working it, after he rented the farm he [...] would find it to his interest to cultivate it, simply because it [...] yielded him a profit, and because he was not obliged to pay rent [...] upon it; if required to pay rent for it, he would lose the [...] ordinary rate of profit, would have no reason for cultivating it, [...] of course, and would throw it out of cultivation. Moreover, [...] suppose that lands down to grade three paid rent when A took the [...] farm; now, if the price of produce rises slightly, grade four may [...] pay something, but possibly not enough to warrant any rent going [...] to a landlord. A will put capital on it for this return, but [...] certainly not until the price warrants it; that is, not until the [...] price will return him at least the cost of working the land, [...] plus the profit on his outlay. But the community needed this [...] land, or the price would not have gone up to the point which makes [...] possible its cultivation even for a profit, without rent. There [...] must always be somewhere some land affected in just this way.|$|E

The client is likely <b>to</b> <b>need</b> <b>some</b> suggestions and prompting from the therapist, but it helps if the plan itself comes from the client. It is important that the initial steps be small enough that the client is almost certain to succeed, in order to build confidence.In many cases, the client's problem {{is the result of a}} bad relationship with someone, and since the client cannot change anyone else's behavior, the therapist will focus on things the client can do unilaterally. The client may be concerned that the other person will take advantage of this and not reciprocate, but in most cases a change in behavior will ease the tension enough that the other person also backs off. If this does not happen, the therapist will also encourage the client to build more positive relationships with other people. The relationship with the therapist sustains the client long enough for them to establish these other relationships.|$|E
