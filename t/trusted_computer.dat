External requests are often passed through device drivers to the operating system's kernel, where they can be passed onto applications, or carried out directly. Security of operating systems has long been a concern because of highly sensitive data held on computers, both of a commercial and military nature. The United States Government Department of Defense (DoD) created the <b>Trusted</b> <b>Computer</b> System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) which is a standard that sets basic requirements for assessing the effectiveness of security. This became of vital importance to operating system makers, because the TCSEC was used to evaluate, classify and select trusted operating systems being considered for the processing, storage and retrieval of sensitive or classified information.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Building {{distributed}} content–based publish/subscribe {{systems has}} remained a challenge. Existing solutions typically use a relatively small set of <b>trusted</b> <b>computers</b> as brokers, which may lead to scalability concerns for large Internet–scale workloads. Moreover, since each broker maintains state for {{a large number of}} users, {{it may be difficult to}} tolerate faults at each broker. In this paper we propose an approach to building content–based publish/subscribe systems on top of distributed hash table (DHT) systems. DHT systems have been effectively used for scalable and fault–tolerant resource lookup in large peer–to–peer networks. Our approach provides predicate–based query semantics and supports constrained range queries. Experimental evaluation shows that our approach is scalable to thousands of brokers, although proper tuning is required. ...|$|R

An analysis of the work's decompiled code revealed a battery of attacks by a knowledgeable insider, and demonstrated a number of security weaknesses. The attack occurred in an open network, and little can be inferred about the vulnerabilities of closed networks used for critical operations. The attack showed that passwork protection procedures need review and strengthening. It showed that sets of mutually <b>trusting</b> <b>computers</b> need to be carefully controlled. Sharp public reaction crystalized into a demand for user awareness and accountability in a networked world...|$|R

Adequate information security is one of the basic requirements of all electronic business processes. It is crucial for effective solutions that the possibilities offered by security technology can be integrated with the commercial requirements of the applications.

40|$|Abstract—Group Decision Making (GDM) is an {{important}} human activity and it has many practical applications in society, economy, management and engineering, etc. Researchers are faced with new challenges in research on theory and methods of GDM with the rapid advent of internet and information technology. One of the challenges in collaborative work is social decision making in a computer mediated environment. Social trust models like recommender system, Bayesian trust for pervasive computing, are becoming invaluable part of distributed systems, where uncertainty prevails. In this paper we have proposed a Trust based collaborative decision making algorithm for distributed environment in which a group of agents collaborate for decision making.

However with emergence of distributed applications, untrusted systems can now participate in {{electronic commerce}}. Attacks against these systems can compromise business processes that constitute electronic commerce. Advances in cryptography and network technology have made data security a tractable and well understood problem. However, process security continues to be a challenge. The goal {{of this paper is to}} show that some of these challenges may be due to misunderstanding of the problem; and a better understanding may lead to practical and effective solutions...|$|R
