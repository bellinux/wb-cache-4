25|$|The Spanish {{settlement}} of Alta California {{was the last}} colonization project to expand Spain's vastly over-extended empire in North America, and they <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with minimal cost and support. Approximately {{half the cost of}} settling Alta California was borne by donations and half by funds from the Spanish crown. Massive Indian revolts in New Mexico's Pueblo Revolt among the Pueblo Indians of the Rio Grande valley in the 1680s as well as Pima Indian Revolt in 1751 and the ongoing Seri conflicts in Sonora Mexico provided the Franciscan friars with arguments to establish missions with fewer colonial settlers. In particular, the sexual exploitation of Native American women by Spanish soldiers sparked violent reprisals from the Native community and the spread of venereal disease.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Science Journal G. Wayne Clough, the 12th secretary of the Smithsonian Institution assuaged [...] the animosities between critics and proponents of the exhibition: [...] “So I don't think there's anything negative here. I think the Smithsonian <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> right. When we heard the concerns, we asked the community to come together and talk about it, and we listened, and some people in that audience had their minds changed, as a matter of fact, but not everybody. So, I think it's time {{in a situation like this}} to pause, and for the profession itself to say, [...] "Okay, there's a problem, what are you going to do about it? And, you remember, the United States never signed the UNESCO treaty.” ...|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the season, Fazekas recalled the potential story revolving around Carter having a girls night out, saying that they realized that [...] "once Peggy is on the mission, it starts to become difficult for her to have a social life...we kept sort of punting that scene because every time we <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> it was like, 'She's not going to stop to go out to dinner. She has the world to save.'" [...] Also, they felt they were not properly servicing Angie's character, instead [...] "just sticking her in scenes just to be there," [...] resulting in the decision to ultimately not bring Angie back for the season as planned. In her place, the characters of Ana Jarvis and Rose Roberts are featured as confidante's for Carter, [...] "both people who are 100% in on Peggy's secret. Angie sort of figures it {{out at the end of}} the first season but Ana and Rose—there is no need to hide the truth from them. So it makes it a lot easier for her to confide in them." ...|$|E
2500|$|A new {{constitution}} was ratified in 1973 {{which included the}} separation of church and state clause, signaling a new development in the body of law on religious affairs. [...] Joaquin Bernas, a Filipino Jesuit specializing in constitutional law, acknowledges that there were complex issues that were brought to court and numerous attempts to use the separation of Church and State against the Roman Catholic Church, but he defends the statement, saying that the fact that he [...] <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> does not deny the validity of {{the separation of church}} and state.|$|E

After the towering first six, he appealed against the light! Even for fiery Freddie, that was cheek of the highest order. Richie and I both burst out laughing and, needless to say the appeal was not upheld. Test cricket can have its lighter moments. Freddie's response was to crash another giant six about 20 yards deeper, but unfortunately, he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again and was caught by Benaud off Mackay at extra cover.|$|E
2500|$|Browning {{testified that}} the Madagascar Plan of 1940–41 was [...] "fantastic" [...] and [...] "bizarre", but countered Irving's {{suggestion}} that this proves the alleged impossibility of the Holocaust by stating: [...] "...I do think they took it seriously. It is fantastic, but of course, Auschwitz is fantastic, too". Browning {{testified that the}} Madagascar Plan was not [...] "Hitler's pipe dream" [...] as Irving claimed, and that [...] "I would not call it a pipe dream, because I think, if England had surrendered, they would have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> They {{would have tried to}} implement it just as they tried to implement the Lublin reservation plan [...] and just as they tried and succeeded in implementing the death camp plans." ...|$|E

We really had great times together." [...] Of Newhart's other long-running sitcom, Newhart, Wallace said, [...] "But {{some of the}} other great comedic talents who had a brilliant show, when they <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> twice, it didn't always work. And that's what... but like Bob, as far as I'm concerned, Bob is like the Fred Astaire of comics. He just makes it look so easy, and he's not as in-your-face as some might be. And so, you just kind of take it for granted, how extraordinarily funny and how he wears well." [...] She was later reunited with Newhart twice, once in a reprise of her role as Carol on Murphy Brown in 1994, and on an episode of Newhart's short-lived sitcom, George & Leo, in 1997.|$|E

2500|$|The {{study of}} old {{instruments}} and historic performance practice {{has taught us}} a great deal, but the main point, the impact of harmony, has been ignored. This is proved {{by the fact that}} tempo is described as an independent phenomenon. It is claimed that one of Bach's gavottes must be played fast and another one slowly. But tempo is not independent! … I think that concerning oneself purely with historic performance practice and the attempt to reproduce the sound of older styles of music-making is limiting and no indication of progress. Mendelssohn and Schumann tried to introduce Bach into their own period, as did Liszt with his transcriptions and Busoni with his arrangements. In America Leopold Stokowski also <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with his arrangements for orchestra. This was always the result of [...] "progressive" [...] efforts to bring Bach closer to the particular period. I have no philosophical problem with someone playing Bach and making it sound like Boulez. My problem is more with someone who tries to imitate the sound of that time… ...|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{developed}} the tour as an audiovisual storybook, sharing her life experience through {{the evolution of}} her music. Catherine McHugh of Entertainment Design reports [...] "Part of the reason Janet Jackson titled her latest record The Velvet Rope was to criticize barriers that separate different classes in society. So {{from the beginning of}} her show, Jackson strives to prove her accessibility to her audience. The spectacular opening presents Jackson's life—at least professionally—as an open book." [...] The stage was designed by Mark Fisher, saying [...] "She wanted to have a book opening and herself come out of it. So I finessed that book into the video screen." [...] Fisher explained, [...] "Each different scene in the show would be akin to turning the pages in this book, and all the albums that she'd done in the past—Control, Rhythm Nation, janet.—would be represented." [...] Regarding its introduction, Fisher said, [...] "The elevator deposits her gracefully, as befits a princess, on the very front of the downstage." [...] "And of course, the entirely cool and wonderful and breaking-new-ground aspect of it is that it's all made possible by a thin LED screen." [...] Roy Bennett stated [...] "We talked about developing the show around the scenarios of her career. I kept that in mind while lighting each different scene, but I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in an abstract way, without jumping too far away from the overall look of the show." ...|$|E
