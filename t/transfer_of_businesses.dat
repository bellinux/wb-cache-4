40|$|The {{protection}} of employees and employment levels {{in the event of}} a business crisis or insolvency - Summary. The research, from a historical reconstruction of the internal discipline of the circulatory phenomenon of  performing firms and considering the European Union law and its jurisprudence, has focused on innovations that have affected domestic order with respect to the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>businesses</b> in crisis or insolvent as a result of the conviction of our country by the European Court of Justice judgment no. 561 / 07 of 2009. In particular, the analysis focused on new art. 47, c. 4 bis, the l. n. 428 / 1990.   Significant attention has been paid to aspects related not only to the new arrangement and debt restructuring agreement, but also to the extraordinary administration procedure  in relation to  detecting the constant critical issues with respect to the EU Directive no. 2001 / 23. The study ultimately focused on collective protection, as part of the circulatory system, raised in favour of the employees of companies in crisis or ailing. This can take on strategic importance, with respect to the retention of employment levels. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to analyse the legal {{regulation}} regarding the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>business</b> share {{in a limited}} liability company in the Czech Republic. I have chosen this topic {{because of a lack}} of its legal regulation on the one hand and controversy and topicality on the other hand. The study analyses relevant law, commentaries, books, articles and case law. Moreover, it also compares the current legal regulation with the new legal regulation represented by the new Civil Code and the Act on Commercial Corporations. The main contribution of this paper is in providing a critical perspective on the current legal regulation and also the comparison with the new one. The thesis is composed of five chapters, each of which deals with different issues connected with both the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>business</b> share and the agreement on the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>business</b> share and a comparison with the new regulation. Chapter One is introductory and examines the concept <b>of</b> the <b>business</b> share as a subject-matter of legal relations. Chapter Two is subdivided into nine main parts.
