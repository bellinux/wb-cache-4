Instead of presenting the battles as political and moral issues, Jackson felt racial context and relevance needed to be presented in a more forward way.

Criticism was directed at the lack of focus of the overarching narrative. Aside from this, technical blunders as well as issues with the PC version were received unfavorably.

5|$|Finally, on 30 October, the new long-planned {{offensive}} began, {{and after}} two days a Soviet regiment was encircled. Finnish General Hjalmar Siilasvuo proceeded to clear the perimeter with his troops. After the disappointing performance of the SS units under his command and <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> that he neither the Finnish nor the German high command is going to provide him with additional forces or substantial reinforcements, he slowed down the advance towards the east and instead concentrated on clearing and securing the area. Those mop-up operations were completed by 13 November. By that point the Finnish 3rd Division had killed 3,000 Soviet soldiers and captured 2,600.|$|E

5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> in February 1915 {{that the}} war would not be won quickly, the Navy {{department}} decided to replace the six armored cruisers that had been lost thus far. The ships were improved versions of the Derfflinger class; the primary alterations being {{the adoption of the}} 35cm (13.8in) gun for the main battery, along with a full-length forecastle deck. Four ships were ordered and laid down, but only two of them, Mackensen and Graf Spee, were launched. None of the ships were completed, as work had been diverted to U-boat construction. All four ships were broken up in Germany between 1921 and 1924.|$|E
5|$|Further {{observational}} improvements led to <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> {{that our}} Solar System {{is located in}} the Milky Way galaxy, which is one of many galaxies in the Universe.

The majority of mass in the Universe appears to exist in an unknown form called dark matter.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} {{computational}} aspects related to <b>the</b> construction of <b>realizations</b> of polynomial chaos expansion in high dimension. The method proposed consists of (1) constructing <b>the</b> <b>realizations</b> of <b>the</b> multivariate monomials using a generator of independent <b>realizations</b> of <b>the</b> germs whose probability distribution is the given arbitrary measure and (2) performing an orthogonalization of <b>the</b> <b>realizations</b> of <b>the</b> multivariate monomials with an algorithm {{different from the}} Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization algorithm which is not stable in high dimension. A brief review of polynomial chaos expansion with arbitrary measure is given. <b>The</b> statistically independent <b>realizations</b> of multivariate monomials are introduced. The centered statistically independent realizations of orthonormal multivariate polynomials are developed. Finally, a quantification of the errors induced by the usual methods is given...|$|R

5|$|Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd list {{four main}} methods of {{creating}} machinima. From simple to advanced, these are: {{relying on the}} game's AI to control most actions, digital puppetry, recamming, and precise scripting of actions. Although simple to produce, AI-dependent results are unpredictable, thus complicating <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> of a preconceived film script. For example, when Rooster Teeth produced The Strangerhood using The Sims 2, a game that encourages the use of its AI, the group had to create multiple instances of each character to accommodate different moods.

Although the performance was praised, she did not get her nomination, as the sombre mood of the picture turned audiences away and box-office returns were poor.
