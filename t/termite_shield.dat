50|$|A <b>termite</b> <b>shield</b> is a {{sheet metal}} {{fabrication}} used in light frame construction {{to reduce the}} movement of termites from the soil into wood framing members such as floor joists and studs.|$|E
50|$|Termite shields {{can be made}} up {{of various}} materials. One type of <b>termite</b> <b>shield</b> is made from various sheet metals {{including}} galvanized steel, terne, copper, or aluminum. The metal is formed to fit between the top of the foundation wall and the bottom of the wood sole plate. The edges of the <b>termite</b> <b>shield</b> are typically hemmed, extended slightly beyond the face of the wall, and turned down to form a drip edge which diverts water running down the face of the wall and reduce the movement of subterranean termites from the soil up into the wood framing members. Termite shields will not protect a building from termite activity, but help make termite activity more visible.|$|E
50|$|Lately, granite and Polyvinyl {{chloride}} (PVC) shield can {{be installed}} into tiny brick open spaces where termites can enter the building surrounding the whole perimeter of the property. The <b>termite</b> <b>shield</b> is too thick for the termites to chew and penetrate the material forcing the termites to migrate into the open {{where they can be}} more easily eradicated. The benefits of using this type of material is that they are sustainable to the environment being awarded Environmental Choice Declaration from the Environmental Labelling Association. Other benefits include being cheaper than metals, and can be coupled with other shield protection systems.|$|E
40|$|With the {{phasing out}} of {{organochlorine}} compounds as termiticides in Australia in 1995, consumers {{and the building}} industry moved to adopt alternative termite control strategies. These include chemical barriers (organophosphates, synthetic pyrethroids, nicotinoids, and phenyl pyrazoles), physical barriers (graded granite stones, stainless steel mesh) use of termite resistant building materials (metal and plastic <b>termite</b> <b>shields</b> and adhesives), and installing a slab construction that conforms with Australian Standard AS 2870 - 1996. The latter requires vibration of the concrete during slab formation, regular inspections, preventative action such as keeping garden beds, mulch, or stacked firewood away from exterior walls, or, {{a combination of all}} of the above methods. The use of preservative treatment of timber as a second line of defence has gained momentum in Australia in recent years. This has arisen from the decline in availability of wood species with naturally durable heartwood. Shorter rotations for forest crops and higher quantities of non-durable sapwood and heartwood of species used in construction have accelerated this trend. Increasingly termite control is adopting integrated pest management (IPM) based on ecological knowledge of termites and minimization of environmental impact of treatments. These include adopting a mix of alternative strategies in termite control that include chemical and physical barriers, and combinations of the same, bait and dust toxicants, treated timber and emphasize building practices that are designed to ëbuild out termitesí and ensure ëwhole of houseí protection of timber in buildings against termites for the reasonable life of the building...|$|R
40|$|Hy-Tech Thermal Solutions, LLC, of Melbourne, Florida, is {{producing}} {{a very complex}} blend of ceramic vacuum-filled refractory products designed to minimize the path of hot air transfer through ceilings, walls, and roofs. The insulating ceramic technology blocks the transfer of heat outward when applied to paint on interior walls and ceilings, and prevents the transfer of heat inward when used to paint exterior walls and roofs, effectively providing year-round comfort in the home. As a manufacturer and marketer of thermal solutions for residential, commercial, and industrial applications, Hy-Tech Thermal Solutions attributes its success to the high performance insulating ceramic microsphere originally developed from NASA thermal research at Ames Research Center. Shaped like a hollow ball so small that {{it looks as if}} it is a single grain of flour to the naked eye (slightly thicker than a human hair), the microsphere is noncombustible and fairly chemical-resistant, and has a wall thickness about 1 / 10 of the sphere diameter, a compressive strength of about 4, 000 pounds per square inch, and a softening point of about 1, 800 C. Hy-Tech Thermal Solutions improved upon these properties by removing all of the gas inside and creating a vacuum. In effect, a 'mini thermos bottle' is produced, acting as a barrier to heat by reflecting it away from the protected surface. When these microspheres are combined with other materials, they enhance the thermal resistance of those materials. In bulk, the tiny ceramic 'beads' have the appearance of a fine talcum powder. Their inert, nontoxic properties allow them to mix easily into any type of paint, coating, adhesive, masonry, or drywall finish. Additionally, their roundness causes them to behave like ball bearings, rolling upon each other, and letting the coatings flow smoothly. When applied like paint to a wall or roof, the microsphere coating shrinks down tight and creates a dense film of the vacuum cells. The resulting ceramic layer improves fire resistance, protects from ultraviolet rays, repels insects such as <b>termites,</b> and <b>shields</b> from the destructive forces of nature...|$|R
40|$|In the tropics, {{termites}} {{are major}} pests of buildings such as offices and stores. Buildings of traditional construction {{may have to}} be replaced every 3 - 9 years; grain stores may need replacing annually. Entire villages have had to be relocated because of termite infestation. Even modern concrete and brick buildings are not immune, since termite damage to door and window frames and wooden rafters can require costly repairs. In the past, highly toxic compounds such as copper aceto-arsenite (Paris green) or sodium arsenite were used to protect buildings against termites. They were replaced in the 1940 s by organochlorine insecticides such as aldrin, dieldrin and chlordane. Concern over environmental damage caused by these insecticides led to their being banned or withdrawn from use in many countries. They were replaced by insecticides such as chlorpyrifos, oftanol, permethrin and cypermethrin. However, these materials are too costly for widespread use in many ACP countries where low cost, locally available solutions are needed. Most termite damage to buildings is caused by subterranean termites which live under, or near, buildings which they enter through cracks or by constructing soil runways over the footings and lower wall. From there, they move throughout the building either within the walls, or under soil runways on walls. The most effective method of control is to create a barrier between the building and the soil. This is most easily accomplished during construction and is more readily achieved in concrete and brick buildings than in traditional structures. Whatever the type of building, however, all potentially termite-attracting wood debris, including tree stumps and roots, should be removed from the site before construction begins. A concrete base provides an effective barrier to termites entering through the floor of a structure. It should be cast as a single slab on ground which has been well compacted to avoid subsidence and cracking of the base. Holes around services (pipes and cables) which pass through the slab should be sealed with a pitch-based sealing compound. Termites then need to construct soil tubes on the outside if they are {{to gain access to the}} building. If the base of the wall is kept clear of plants and debris and painted white, termite runways will be easily seen. They can be cleaned off to prevent termites becoming established inside the building. This treatment can tee very effective if carried out regularly. <b>Termite</b> <b>shields</b> fitted on top of the foundations, sleeper walls or piers also prevent termite access. The most effective shields consists of a continuous strip of copper, aluminium or galvanised iron around the building beneath the entire thickness of the wall and extending out from the building for 50 mm then bent downwards at 450 for 50 mm (Fig la). All joints should be double locked and brazed or soldered. A simpler shield consists of a cement sill around the building, preferably with a groove cut into the underside (Fig 1 b). Shields should be at least 180 mm above the ground and should be inspected regularly for damage. Buildings of traditional construction are more difficult to protect. Many have a framework of wooden poles driven into the ground, which is then covered in mud or clay. Termites tunnel through the wood, wee ken the walls and destroy the structure. Walls made solely of mud may not attract termites, but the addition of straw to mud can encourage termites to tunnel into walls. Termites also tunnel through walls or construct soil tubes over them to attack the rafters and thatch. Wherever possible, termite-resistant wood should be used in construction. Several locally available materials are said to protect wood against termites. These include wood ash placed in post holes. Poles can also be treated by burning or charring the outer wood of the pole or painting it with used engine oil or creosote. Engine oil mixed into the soil along the base of the walls may also protect them. Some plant extracts (e. g. sap of Calotropis spp.) can protect timber for several months. Traditional grain and food stores may also be attacked. Some stores are more susceptible than others. Stores are built on top of 2 m high slabs of rock in India to protect them against termites. In Zimbabwe, a base of resistant timber pro sects the store, while in Ethiopia the termite susceptible stilts below the stores are replaced annually. Oversized termite caps (Fig 2) on the legs of stores also protect the contents against rats and mice. We know that termite damage to traditional and modern buildings can be reduced or controlled without the use of in ported pesticides; further research would help to test and improve these alternative methods of control. Further work is being undertaken by the Natural Resources Institute (NRI).
