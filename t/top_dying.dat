50|$|<b>Top</b> <b>dying</b> {{disease is}} a disease of Heritiera fomes, the {{dominant}} species of mangrove tree growing in the Sundarbans.

5000|$|Heritiera fomes is {{a species}} of {{mangrove}} tree in the family Malvaceae. Its common names include sunder, sundri, jekanazo and pinlekanazo. It is the dominant mangrove tree species of the Sundarbans of Bangladesh and India, and comprises about 70% of {{the trees in the}} area. H. fomes is a major timber-producing tree. It is threatened by over-harvesting, water diversions in the Ganges Basin, fluctuations in salinity due to upstream and coastal development and <b>top</b> <b>dying</b> disease. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as being [...] "endangered".|$|E
50|$|About 63% of {{the trees}} growing in the Sundarbans are Heritiera fomes. Sporadic {{instances}} of <b>top</b> <b>dying</b> disease had been noticed in these trees earlier {{in the twentieth century}} but the disease became more acute and extensive after about 1970. An inventory of trees in the Sundarbans in 1985 recorded 45 million diseased trees with nearly half of these having more than half their crown affected. No causal agent has been discovered and the dieback is thought {{to be the result of}} stressful conditions, perhaps caused by an increase in the heavy metal concentration of the sediment deposited in the delta.|$|E
5000|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature has {{assessed}} this mangrove as being [...] "endangered". Although {{it is common}} in places, it has a restricted range and is declining because of the clearing of mangroves for coastal development, rice farming, shrimp ponds and oil palm plantations. It is present in several protected areas in the Sundarbans in Bangladesh, but there and elsewhere it is being affected by <b>top</b> <b>dying</b> disease. This causes branches {{and parts of the}} crown to die back, and can result in tree mortality. Gall cankers may be present in affected parts and wood-boring insects and fungi also attack the trees.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method to reduce the supply voltage IR drop of 3 D stacked-die systems by {{implementing}} an on-chip Buck Converter on <b>Top</b> <b>die</b> (BCT) scheme. The IR drop {{is caused by the}} parasitic resistance of Through Silicon Vias (TSV’s) used in the 3 D integration. The IR drop reduction and the overhead associated with the BCT scheme are modeled and analyzed. A 3 D stacked-die system is manufactured using 90 nm CMOS technology with TSV’s and a silicon interposer.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} in the coastal zone of developing countries is salinity intrusion. It is increasing in those countries due to natural and anthropogenic reasons. Soil salinity is causing decline in soil productivity and crop yield, which result in severe degradation of bio-environment and ecology. The effect of salinity on the agriculture crop is well understood even in developing countries but the effect on ecology is less explored. So in Bangladesh a perception analysis has been made {{on the effect of}} soil salinity on the homestead gardens of the worst salinity affected district Satkhira (21 ° 36 `- 22 ° 54 ` N and 88 ° 54 `- 89 ° 20 ` E). It has been found that the people have recognized salinity as a problem and construction of shrimp enclosures and maritime influence as the main reasons. Salinity increase results in reduction of crop production (2. 50 % per year), tree growth (2 % per year) and vegetation coverage (1. 87 % per year). Tree species are disappearing due to salinity (three main species are Swietenia macrophylla King> Achras zapota Linn. > Spondias pinnata (Linn. f.) Kurz). The remaining trees are affected by diseases, like, <b>top</b> <b>dying,</b> leaf shedding and root rot. The main salt tolerant species are Acacia nilotica (Linn.)

40|$|Field {{studies were}} {{conducted}} in the years 2003 - 2005 in the Rymanów Forest Unit in 13 stands aged between 40 to 100 years, which had 10 % - 60 % of the sycamore in their species composition. They grew on a mountain forest site (12 stands) and mountain riparian forest (1 stand). In each of them 100 trees were examined, growing {{next to each other}} in the central part of the stands. The disease symptoms, on trunks and in the crown area of each tree, and their intensity were determined according to the predefined symptomatic - developmental code. More than 80 fragments of wood and bark were collected from trunks of living and dead trees with local cankers and bark peeling off exposing wood. From the samples, 798 isolations were made on 2 % malt - agar medium. The examined sycamores in the Rymanów Forest Unit showed a large variation in the disease symptoms and their occurrence frequency. Among 1300 analyzed trees, only 13. 7 % did not show external, macroscopic disease symptoms. There was a relatively large share of dead trees (15. 0 %), which in individual stands ranged 4. 0 - 32. 0 %. The most frequent symptoms in crowns were as follows: <b>top</b> <b>dying</b> (6. 3 % trees), entire branch dying (16. 2 %) or only their tops (9. 6 %), crown thinning (19. 4 %), leaf atrophy (10. 8 %) and leaf discoloration (11. 6 %). On sycamores trunks, the following symptoms were found: plate-like and strip-like necrosis of bark that was breaking, falling off and exposing wood (8. 6 % trees), local bark cankers (14. 7 %), among which healed ones dominated (10. 3 %), bark cracks (14. 3 %) and tree cancer symptoms (3. 8 %). Bark necrosis and wood exposure formed 1. 5 times more frequently on the northern and western side than on the southern and eastern side, bark cracks appeared most frequently on the southern trunk side. On the cross sections of sycamore trunks, the following symptoms were found predominantly: T-shaped discolorations which appeared in the place of local healed cankers, dead wood regions in the places of local unhealed cankers and widespread bark cankers, sometimes taking the form of a sector reaching the part near the pith, and greyish - green or greenish - brown wood discolorations in the form of numerous stains, especially in the trunk periphery part. On the trunks of 184 (14. 2 %) sycamores, perithecia of Nectria coccinea were present. They formed in the area of cankers on bark and exposed wood alike. Fruiting bodies of Nectria cinnabarina, Eutypa acharii, Melanomma pulvis-pyrius, conidiomata of Cytospora ambiens, Aposphaeria cf. pulviscula and conidiomata of Stegonsporium pyriforme occurred sporadically. From wood, the following were isolated predominantly: Basidiomycetes sp. 1, Chalara sp. 1, Cadophora fastigiata, Nectria cinnabarina and Cytospora ambiens. Chalara sp. 1, with its morphological features, best matched the anamorph of Ceratocystis coerulescens sensu lato...|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a deep drawing die (1) with a <b>top</b> <b>die</b> and a bottom die (2, 3), wherein the <b>top</b> <b>die</b> (2) has a holding down clamp (2 a) and the bottom die (3) has a die plate (3 a), and wherein at least one device (6), with which {{the distance between the}} holding down clamp (2 a) and the die plate (3 a) can be modified in portions or partially, is arranged in a flange region. The invention further relates to a method for deep drawing a workpiece (4) with a deep drawing die (1), wherein a workpiece (4) is inserted between a <b>top</b> <b>die</b> and a bottom die (2, 3) and deep drawn by closing the <b>top</b> and bottom <b>dies</b> (2, 3), and wherein at least one actuator (8) is controlled to generate a holding force during deep drawing. Essentially, the invention presented controls the flange feed of a workpiece (4) in the tool (1) by pressure distributions which are adjustable in the forming process. By selectively increasing forces in the flange feed at selected locations between holding down clamp (2 a) and die plate (3 a) it is possible to control the flow of material into the die plate (3 a) during deep drawing. Using this control, it is possible to relieve the load on regions with high deforming work, so that tears or cracks at these points in the finished component can be prevented. This involves increasing the friction between die plate (3 a) and plate (4) or between plate (4) and holding down clamp (2 a) by generating holding forces, as a result of which the material is held fast and prevented from flowing at this location...|$|R
