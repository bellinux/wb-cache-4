5|$|A {{controller}} in {{the cockpit}} allowed the visor to be retracted and <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> to be lowered to 5° below the standard horizontal position for taxiing and take-off. Following take-off and after clearing the airport, <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> and visor were raised. Prior to landing, the visor was again retracted and <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> lowered to 12.5° below horizontal for maximal visibility. Upon landing <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> was raised to the 5° position to avoid the possibility of damage.|$|E
5|$|Pilots {{noted that}} in a crosswind, <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> of the plane would not point {{directly}} at the enemy, but could be, say, 20 degrees off, {{to compensate for the}} wind. Since making the beams bright enough at such a wide angle was impracticable, pilots were instructed to fly on the curving approach path which keeps <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> pointed towards the enemy at all times, rather than a straight-line path with <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> pointed upwind.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Nose</b> saw {{a second}} free ascent in 1998, when Scott Burke summitted after 261 days of effort. Then, on October 14, 2005, {{the team of}} Tommy Caldwell and Beth Rodden also free climbed <b>The</b> <b>Nose,</b> and on October 16, 2005, Caldwell did it in less than 12 hours.|$|E

5|$|Weapon turrets were {{mounted at}} <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> {{and the middle}} of {{aircraft}} underbelly. <b>The</b> <b>nose</b> turret could rotate +/- 100° from the aircraft's centerline and could mount either a 40mm (1.57in) grenade launcher, or a 7.62mm (0.308in) minigun. The belly turret included a 30mm (1.18in) automatic cannon with 360° of rotation. Mechanical stops prevented the belly turret from aiming at {{any part of the}} helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Concorde's {{drooping}} nose, {{developed by}} Marshall's of Cambridge at Cambridge Airport, enabled the aircraft to switch between being streamlined to reduce drag and achieve optimal aerodynamic efficiency without obstructing the pilot's view during taxi, take-off, and landing operations. Due {{to the high}} angle of attack, the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the capability to droop. The droop nose {{was accompanied by a}} moving visor that retracted into <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> prior to being lowered. When <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> was raised to horizontal, the visor would rise in front of the cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining.|$|E

5|$|Helena was {{a lively}} and outspoken child, and reacted against brotherly teasing by {{punching}} the bully on <b>the</b> <b>nose.</b> Her early talents included drawing. Lady Augusta Stanley, a lady-in-waiting to the Queen, commented favourably on the three-year-old Helena's artwork.|$|E
5|$|Like {{a number}} of other delta-wing {{aircraft}} designed to cruise at very high speeds, the Valkyrie included a droop-nose that allowed the pilots to view the ground during the nose-high takeoff and landing. The Concorde or Tupolev Tu-144 both used a design where the entire nose section was angled downward, including outer window panels, exposing interior windows that were more vertically angled. In the B-70 design, only the upper section of <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> moved down into a fixed lower section, and the outer window panels moved with it to become more vertical, at 24degrees slope. With <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> raised into its high-speed position, the outer windows were almost horizontal. A system that blew 600F air from the engines was used for both defogging and rain removal. The lower forward section included a radar bay, and production machines were to be equipped with a refueling receptacle on the upper surface of <b>the</b> <b>nose.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} is congenital and {{is characterized by}} a number of nasal, facial and cranial features. These include a broad and high, sometimes depressed nasal bridge (top of <b>the</b> <b>nose,</b> between the eyes) and a flattened nasal tip. This can give <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> a shortened, arch-like appearance. Hypertelorism (unusually wide-set eyes), prominent frontal bones and supraorbital ridge (the eyebrow ridge), bilateral epicanthic folds (an extra flap of skin over the eyelids), a broad forehead and an overall enlarged head circumference have also been observed. A bulging of the upper lip with an exaggerated cupid's bow shape, and maxillary hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the upper jaw) with retraction have also been reported.|$|E

5|$|Telangiectasia (small {{vascular}} malformations) {{may occur}} in the skin and mucosal linings of <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> and gastrointestinal tract. The most common problem is nosebleeds (epistaxis), which happen frequently from childhood and affect about 90–95% of people with HHT. Lesions on the skin and in the mouth bleed less often but may be considered cosmetically displeasing; they affect about 80%. The skin lesions characteristically occur on the lips, <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> and the fingers, and on {{the skin of the}} face in sun-exposed areas. They appear suddenly, with the number increasing over time.|$|E
5|$|The XF6U {{was a small}} {{aircraft}} with tricycle {{landing gear}} and with straight wings and tail surfaces. The wings were short enough {{that they did not}} need to fold. In order to fit more aircraft into crowded hangars, <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> gear could be retracted and the aircraft's weight would rest on a small wheel attached by the ground crew. This raised the tail up so that it could overlap <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> of the aircraft behind it, allowing more aircraft to fit into available hangar space. The turbojet engine was mounted {{in the rear of the}} fuselage and was fed by ducts in each wing root.|$|E

5|$|The YF-23 was an unconventional-looking aircraft, with {{diamond-shaped}} wings, {{a profile}} with substantial area-ruling to reduce aerodynamic drag at transonic speeds, and an all-moving V-tail. The cockpit was placed high, near <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> {{of the aircraft}} for good visibility for the pilot. The aircraft featured a tricycle landing gear configuration with a nose landing gear leg and two main landing gear legs. The weapons bay {{was placed on the}} underside of the fuselage between <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> and main landing gear. The cockpit has a center stick and side throttle.|$|E
5|$|The cannon is in a {{compartment}} {{beneath the}} cockpit, {{mounted on a}} load-bearing beam attached to the cockpit floor and the forward fuselage support structure. <b>The</b> <b>nose</b> is fitted with distinctive twin pitot probes and hinges up for service access.|$|E
5|$|The three {{subspecies}} {{also differ}} in their colour. A. m. angolensis has a brown to tawny coat, with thick, dark brown stripes on the face extending two-thirds down to the snout. While the lateral stripe is nearly black, the stripe on the rump is dark brown. The medium brown forehead patch extends to eye level and is separated from the bright white face by a dark brown border. A brown spot is seen on <b>the</b> <b>nose.</b> A. m. hofmeyri is a light fawn, with thin, dark brown face stripes. The stripes on the flanks are dark brown to black, and the posterior stripes are moderately brown. The forehead patch, dark brown or fawn, extends beyond {{the level of the}} eyes and mixes with the white of the face without any clear barriers. <b>The</b> <b>nose</b> may have a pale smudge. A. m. marsupialis is a rich chestnut brown, with thin, light face stripes. The stripe near the rump is well-marked, and that on the flanks is deep brown. The forehead is brown, fawn, or white, the patch not extending beyond the eyes and having no sharp boundaries. <b>The</b> <b>nose</b> is white or marked with brown.|$|E

5000|$|The slope or {{pitch of}} the stairs is the ratio between the rise and the going (not the tread depth, due to <b>the</b> <b>nosing).</b> It is {{sometimes}} called the rake of the stairs. The pitch line is the imaginary line along the tip of <b>the</b> <b>nosing</b> of <b>the</b> treads. In the UK, stair pitch is the angle the pitch line makes with the horizontal, measured in degrees. The value of the slope, as a ratio, is then the tangent of the pitch angle.|$|R
