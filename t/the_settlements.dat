5|$|The first {{operation}} {{involving the}} 6th Airlanding Brigade followed two attacks by the Palmach on coastguard stations over {{the night of}} 24/25November. Palestine Police Force dogs tracked the attackers to <b>the</b> <b>settlements</b> of Rishpon and Sidna Ali. In the following cordon and search operation, the police were stoned by the inhabitants, and the soldiers on the cordon had to prevent reinforcements from other settlements reaching the villages. The next day, 26November, the police were involved in hand-to-hand fighting with the villagers and eventually withdrew, calling on the brigade to enter <b>the</b> <b>settlements</b> and enforce law and order. Leaving some men behind on the cordon {{to hold back the}} estimated 3,000 crowd, the remainder of the brigade entered <b>the</b> <b>settlements.</b> Here they carried out several baton charges {{and for the first time}} used tear gas to disperse the crowds. In the cleanup operation, 900 persons were later arrested.|$|E
5|$|From then on, {{spiritual and}} secular {{administration}} {{were to be}} strictly separated. At {{the time of the}} expulsion, 25Jesuits served a Christianized population of at least 24,000, in the ten missions of the Chiquitania. The Chiquitos mission properties included 25estancias (ranches) with 31,700cattle and 850horses. Libraries across <b>the</b> <b>settlements</b> held 2,094volumes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, the only road in Davidson Township, Sullivan County besides the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike passed near Muncy Creek and <b>the</b> <b>settlements</b> along it. The valley of Muncy Creek is largely undeveloped, largely lacking even summer camps.|$|E

5|$|Singapore {{was under}} British {{rule in the}} 19th century, having been amalgamated into the Straits Settlements {{together}} with Malacca and Penang. The flag {{that was used to}} represent <b>the</b> <b>Settlements</b> was a British Blue Ensign containing three gold crowns—one for each settlement—separated by a red inverted pall, which resembles an inverted Y.|$|E
5|$|The Persian army then re-conquered <b>the</b> <b>{{settlement}}s</b> on the Asian {{side of the}} Propontis, {{while the}} Persian fleet sailed up the European coast of the Hellespont, taking each settlement in turn. With all of Asia Minor now firmly returned to Persian rule, the revolt was finally over.|$|E
50|$|Within the {{framework}} of administrative divisions, <b>the</b> urban-type <b>settlement</b> of Nagorny is incorporated within Neryungrinsky District as <b>the</b> <b>Settlement</b> of Nagorny.

50|$|In Pigford v. Glickman, U.S. Federal District Court Judge Paul L. Friedman {{approved}} <b>the</b> <b>settlement</b> {{and consent}} decree on April 14, 1999. <b>The</b> <b>settlement</b> recognized discrimination against 22,363 black farmers but the NBFA would later call the agreement incomplete because more than 70,000 were excluded. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>settlement</b> was {{deemed to be}} the largest-ever civil rights class action settlement in American history. Lawyers estimated the value of <b>the</b> <b>settlement</b> {{to be more than}} $2 billion. Some farmers would have their debts forgiven. Judge Friedman appointed a monitor to oversee <b>the</b> <b>settlement.</b> Farmers in Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Georgia were among those affected by <b>the</b> <b>settlement.</b>|$|R
50|$|Logging {{and gold}} mining are {{conducted}} {{in the area around}} <b>the</b> <b>settlement.</b> <b>The</b> economic importance of <b>the</b> <b>settlement</b> itself is mainly due to the BAM railway. <b>The</b> <b>settlement</b> is <b>the</b> terminus of the electrified western section.

5|$|The {{history of}} Briarcliff Manor {{can be traced}} back to the {{founding}} of a settlement between the Hudson and Pocantico Rivers in the 19th century. The area now known as Briarcliff Manor had seen human occupation since at least the Archaic period, but significant growth in <b>the</b> <b>settlements</b> that are now incorporated into the village did not occur until the Industrial Revolution.|$|E
5|$|According to the Instituto Nacional de Estatística (National Institute of Statistics, or Statistics Portugal), {{the city}} of Caldas da Rainha {{contains}} the entirety of Santo Onofre, most of Nossa Senhora do Pópulo (excluding <b>the</b> <b>settlements</b> of Lagoa Parceira, Imaginário, and Casal do Tanqueirão) and the southernmost portion of Tornada, but the municipal assembly does not accept any portion of Tornada {{as part of the}} city. Nossa Senhora do Pópulo and Santo Onofre are separated by the Linha do Oeste (Western Line) railway line, as specified in the 1984 law (effective 1 January 1985) that carved Santo Onofre out of the civil parish that was called Caldas da Rainha at that time.|$|E
5|$|All {{tourists}} {{traveling to}} Svalbard must pay a tourist tax of 150 Norwegian krone, which is entirely used for conservation.

This includes the requirement to sign a special insurance policy to cover any search and rescue costs the Governor would incur, should it be necessary.|$|E
5000|$|You do {{not have}} the right to exclude {{yourself}} from <b>the</b> <b>settlement</b> in this case. The case was certified under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1) as a [...] "non-opt out" [...] class action. Therefore, you will be bound by any judgments or orders that are entered in this Action and, if <b>the</b> <b>settlement</b> is approved, you will be deemed to have released Defendants Rusty Carroll and R2C2, Inc. from all claims that were or could have been asserted in this case or otherwise included in the release in <b>the</b> <b>settlement,</b> other than your right to obtain the relief provided to you, if any, by <b>the</b> <b>settlement.</b> Although you cannot opt out of <b>the</b> <b>settlement</b> agreement, you can object to <b>the</b> <b>settlement</b> and ask <b>the</b> Court not to approve <b>the</b> <b>settlement</b> in its current form.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two small}} chapel-shrines in <b>the</b> <b>settlement.</b> One, north of <b>the</b> <b>settlement,</b> dates to <b>the</b> late 19th century. The second, {{dedicated}} to Our Lady of Lourdes, {{to the south}} of <b>the</b> <b>settlement,</b> was built in 1996.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>settlement</b> {{was first}} founded on September 27, 1480, as Pohost Zarzeczny (Погост-Зарічний). In 1946, <b>the</b> <b>settlement</b> was renamed {{to its current}} [...] "Zarichne."

5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} at Dwarka, both {{on shore}} and offshore in the Arabian Sea, {{have been performed}} by the Archaeological Survey of India. The first investigations carried out on land in 1963 revealed many artifacts. Excavations done at two sites on the seaward side of Dwarka brought to light submerged settlements, a large stone-built jetty, and triangular stone anchors with three holes. <b>The</b> <b>settlements</b> are {{in the form of}} exterior and interior walls, and fort bastions. From the typological classification of the anchors it is inferred that Dwarka had flourished as a port during the period of the Middle kingdoms of India. Coastal erosion was probably the cause of the destruction of what was an ancient port.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, {{during the}} summer of 1812 or 1813, Alder was elected captain of a company of 70 men formed in Plain City. With Frederick Loyd as his lieutenant, Alder's company was ordered by the Governor to march about twenty miles north and build a {{blockhouse}} at Mill Creek, about three miles north of Marysville, Ohio, to protect the Darby settlements. The company built and garrisoned the blockhouse for a few weeks, but when a false alarm was sounded regarding Indians attacking <b>the</b> <b>settlements,</b> the men returned to their homes. This was the only fort ever constructed in Union County, and some of the foundation is still visible today.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{departure}} of the Romans, the Sheffield area may have been {{the southern part of the}} Celtic kingdom of Elmet, with the rivers Sheaf and Don forming part of the boundary between this kingdom and the kingdom of Mercia. Gradually, Anglian settlers pushed west from the kingdom of Deira. The Britons of Elmet delayed this English expansion into the early part of the 7th century. An enduring Celtic presence within this area is evidenced by <b>the</b> <b>settlements</b> called Wales and Waleswood close to Sheffield—the word Wales derives from the Germanic word Walha, and was originally used by the Anglo-Saxons to refer to the native Britons.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>settlement</b> was {{originally}} called Reka (literally, 'river'), after the Reka River south of <b>the</b> <b>settlement.</b> <b>The</b> specifier Kočevska 'Kočevje' was added later {{in order to}} distinguish <b>the</b> <b>settlement</b> from <b>the</b> town of Rijeka (Reka) on the Kvarner Gulf, with which the population had trade connections.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>settlement</b> was {{formerly}} called Male Bloke (literally, 'little Bloke'), distinguishing it from Velike Bloke (literally, 'big Bloke'). The Bloke parish church {{was built in}} <b>the</b> <b>settlement</b> and <b>the</b> name Fara (literally, 'parish') became the name of <b>the</b> <b>settlement.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>settlement</b> {{is named}} for Jacob Zuber, {{who lived on the}} {{southeast}} corner of <b>the</b> <b>settlement.</b>|$|R
5|$|For {{many centuries}} thereafter, <b>the</b> <b>settlements</b> around the Mont Blanc massif {{comprised}} a rural population of peasant mountain farmers, living off animal husbandry, supplemented with a meagre harvest of rye and oats. Some {{farmers in the}} valley of Chamonix joined their counterparts from the neighbouring valleys of Maurienne, Beaufortain and Tarentaise and crossed the Alps into southern Germany, Austria and northern Italy to sell their products and bring back goods for sale in local markets.|$|E
5|$|In Algeria, the Muslims {{were not}} {{considered}} French and did not share the same political or economic benefits. For example, the indigenous population did not own most of <b>the</b> <b>settlements,</b> farms, or businesses, although they numbered nearly nine million (versus roughly one million Pieds-Noirs) at independence. Politically, the Muslim Algerians had no representation in the French National Assembly until 1945 and wielded limited influence in local governance. To obtain citizenship, {{they were required to}} renounce their Muslim identity. Since this would constitute apostasy, only about 2,500Muslims acquired citizenship before 1930. The settlers' politically and economically dominant position worsened relations between the two groups.|$|E
5|$|In November 1835, an {{expedition}} led by Governor James Stirling joined another party {{led by the}} Surveyor General John Septimus Roe in King George Sound. Roe had made arrangement for both parties {{to return to the}} Swan River Colony via an alternative route. The route was intended to join <b>the</b> <b>settlements</b> of King George Sound, York and the Swan River Colony along with the newly established settlement of Williams. This expedition passed through the area of Avondale sighting the Dale River and a granite hill that Roe name Bald Hill on 27 December. Bald Hill was to become the primary reference point for surveying the region.|$|E

5|$|In late October and November 1860, Comanches led by Peta Nocona {{conducted}} numerous {{raids on}} various settlements, {{culminating in the}} brutal killing of a pregnant woman. On hearing of these incidents, Houston sent several 25-man companies to assist Ross. A citizen's posse had tracked the raiders to their winter village along the Pease River. As the village contained at least 500 warriors and many women and children, the posse returned to <b>the</b> <b>settlements</b> to recruit additional fighters. Ross requested help from the U.S. Army at Camp Cooper, which sent 21 troops.|$|E
5|$|In {{their design}} of the reductions, the Jesuits were {{inspired}} by “ideal cities“ as outlined in works such as Utopia and Arcadia, written respectively by the 16th-century English philosophers Thomas More and Philip Sidney. The Jesuits had specific criteria for building sites: locations with plenty of wood for construction; sufficient water for the population; good soil for agriculture; and safety from flooding during the rainy season. Although most of the missions in the Chiquitania were relocated at least once {{during the time of}} the Jesuits, four of ten towns remained at their original sites. Wood and adobe were the main materials used in the construction of <b>the</b> <b>settlements.</b>|$|E
5|$|Large Danubian {{complexes}} were {{in recent}} years excavated in the Targowisko and Szarów (Wieliczka County) area of fertile loessial hills. <b>The</b> <b>settlements,</b> which included massive post construction houses even over 50 meters long as well as industrial facilities, extended continuously over a stretch of land more than three kilometers long. Some of the identified structures functioned together, {{as was the case}} when the buildings were connected by a courtyard and protected by a common fence.|$|E
