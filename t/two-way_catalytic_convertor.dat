40|$|Designing {{automotive}} catalysts {{for effective}} control of NOx, HC and CO emissions under both lean and stoichiometric engine operation is a challenging task. The present work assesses the performance efficiency of a three-zone prototype <b>catalytic</b> <b>convertor</b> in reducing exhaust emissions from a gasoline engine, operating in Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) and Spark Ignition (SI) mode under lean and stoichiometric conditions. The {{performance of the}} convertor for HC oxidation follows the order: lean HCCI > stoichiometric SI > stoichiometric HCCI. The study mainly focused on the quantitative analysis of C 1 –C 7 hydrocarbon compounds {{before and after the}} <b>catalytic</b> <b>convertor.</b> The results show that monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene are present at higher concentrations in the exhaust under HCCI operation than in the SI case.

40|$|The Automobile {{pollution}} {{is the major}} source of pollution. The majority of the environmental {{pollution is}} from the two-wheeler automobiles due to their large number. A study on nano-particle reveals that the ratio of surface area of nano-particle to the volume of the nano-particle is inversely proportional to the radius of the nano-particle. So, on decreasing the radius, this ratio is increased leading to an increased rate of reaction and the concentration of the pollutants is decreased. To achieve this objective, an innovative design of catalytic converter for two-wheeler automobiles is proposed using nano-particle as a catalyst.

Latest technologies have been developed in the automotive exhaust system to acknowledge the emission norms. Diesel oxidation catalyst and Muffler both are playing major roles in reducing emission and noise level as well. Diesel oxidation catalyst reduces CO and unburned HC emissions. Muffler reduces noise level of exhaust gases. Nowadays automobile industry is using CFD software extensively to analyze the flow properties inside the diesel oxidation catalyst and Muffler. Flow analysis helps to optimize the geometric design of Diesel oxidation catalyst to oxidize the CO and unburned HC of exhaust gases.

However, emission of methane is 40 % more in CNG fuelled engines compared to gasoline and diesel. With the exponential growth in CNG fuelled vehicles, CH 4 concentrations have reached an alarming level in the environment. It affects human health and climate change as the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of methane is 21 times more than CO 2 which means that CH 4 will cause 21 times as much warming as an equivalent mass of CO 2.

No single intervention has been shown in a well conducted randomised controlled trial to reduce suicide. The greatest potential seems to arise from limiting the availability of methods.

40|$|AbstractA key {{aspect of}} the Lake Nyos {{incident}} was the exceptionally large quantity of CO 2 that was abruptly released in the incident. The exact quantity is uncertain however there is a consensus view that it amounted to between 1. 0 and 1. 6 million metric tons of CO 2. In the context of CO 2 sequestration this minimum amount of CO 2 corresponds with approximately four months emissions from a 275 MW FutureGen type IGCC or over a month of CO 2 captured from a large, but not atypical, 1000 MW coal fired power plant. This volume of CO 2 is also equivalent to weeks or months of gas that would be transported in the largest pipelines contemplated for a future sequestration project. Given the isolation valves that would be activated the CO 2 released at Lake Nyos was 2 to 3 orders of magnitude larger than the largest release plausible from CO 2 pipelines. Carbon monoxide poisoning utilizing automobile exhaust in an enclosed space for decades was a classic suicide strategy. Since the development of <b>catalytic</b> <b>convertors</b> the carbon monoxide has been in large part converted to carbon dioxide and a nominally non-lethal level of carbon monoxide. Unfortunately suicidal acts continued unabated due to the powerful effects of mixed CO 2 and CO. Although the medical teams reported no definitive evidence of cause of death, they did note that many victims had prominent skin bullae (blister like features) or has succumbed to comas, and that neither of these prominent symptoms {{can be related to}} CO 2. The US medical team concluded that “doubt must remain that all the findings can be attributed to [CO 2] alone” After the Lake Nyos incident, evaluation of the symptoms documented in medical studies from the foreign scientific expeditions lead to a conclusion that the Lake Nyos victims died from carbon monoxide poisoning. Although these assertions have been dismissed by geologists studying the Lake Nyos event, their reasoning appears flawed. A plausible model for the causative agents for the Nyos disaster was a combination of CO 2 (quite possibly at non-lethal concentrations), reduced oxygen, and the critical deadly agent, CO. In the absence of carbon monoxide neither the gas in exhausts from <b>catalytic</b> <b>convertor</b> nor the gas at Lake Nyos, would be capable of killing. This together with the magnitude and circumstances of the release has significance for risks associated with CO 2 transportation by pipeline. Mixed gases are known to be deadly at concentrations at significantly lower than the lethal levels of either component alone. Perhaps the real lesson of the Lake Nyos incident for carbon capture and storage is {{to draw attention to the}} inherent danger from mixtures of toxic gases. For example mixtures of H 2 S with CO 2 will increase the toxic effects of H 2 S. The risk profile for a sequestration project changed a decision is made to inject mixed streams of gas such as CO 2 +H 2 S rather than essentially pure CO 2. A more useful analogy between natural CO 2 seepage and the worst-case scenario for leakage from CO 2 sequestered in deep brine reservoirs is provided by the volcanic/geothermal terrains in Italy, the Azores, and Africa. In this paper the available information and analysis of the presumed CO 2 releases at these sites and the related deaths are reviewed and the implications for evaluating the risk posed by eithe r slow or rapid leakage from CO 2 sequestration are considered...|$|R
40|$|Air {{pollutants}} {{can cause}} poor air quality; however, {{the use of}} heterogeneous catalytic oxidation {{has been shown to}} be an efficient and cost-effective removal method. Some examples of commercial application of such catalysts include <b>catalytic</b> <b>convertors</b> in automobiles and industrial process exhausts. Research with regards to improving these technologies has included using less-expensive catalyst materials, increasing catalytic performance, and achieving higher efficiency. The concept of metal-support interaction (MSI) is one method of altering catalytic performance through changing the properties of the metal catalyst due to the interaction with the support material. Similarly, the phenomenon of electrochemical promotion of catalysis (EPOC) has also been shown to enhance the catalytic activity, however, through the application of a small electrical stimulus to a catalyst-working electrode deposited on a solid electrolyte (e. g. yttria-stablized zirconia). The properties of the metal catalyst are altered due to the movement of ions (in this case, O 2 -) from the electrolyte. Since its discovery, several factors were identified that are preventing EPOC from being commercialized, including the use of thick film catalysts. Implementing nano-catalysts makes this method competitive with typical heterogeneous catalysts; however, it has not been studied by many research groups. Furthermore, many heterogeneous catalytic studies have been performed separately for each of these phenomena; however, a connection between EPOC and MSI has yet to be fully understood. The overall objective of this project is to study the concept of EPOC over highly-dispersed nano-catalysts and determine how MSI relates to the change in catalytic activity. Supported nano-catalysts were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated for catalytic performance using model reactions.

After deposition, the PGEs are subject to various physical and chemical transformations, potentially resulting in migration into other environmental compartments i. e. soils, the aquatic system and biota. However, the processes involved are poorly understood and the reactivity, bioavailability, and speciation of the PGEs are ill defined. In contrast to environmental studies, in geochemical research, Isotope Dilution ICP-MS (ID ICP-MS) has primarily been used for the quantification of Pt, providing a significant improvement in accuracy by allowing removal from the analyte solution of elements which could potentially give isobaric interference in the mass spectra. In the present work, an ID ICP-MS analytical technique with a detection limit of 0. 1 mug kg(- 1) has been used for determination of concentrations of Pt in road dust samples from west central Scotland. The study highlights potential interference problems that may occur in analysis of Pt in environmental matrices using ICP-MS. Initial application of ID ICP-MS in a study of roadside environments in west central Scotland has revealed significantly enhanced concentrations of Pt, within the range 13 - 335 mug kg(- 1), in road dust samples from a trunk road and motorway, representing a significant increase relative to surface soils in this area that are remote from roads, which have Pt concentrations of less than 1. 0 mug kg(- 1).

These measurements are used to assess the degree of closure within the reactive odd nitrogen (NxOy) budget through the comparison of the values of NOy measured with a <b>catalytic</b> <b>convertor</b> to the sum of individually measured NOy(i) compounds (i. e., Sigma NOy(i) = NOx + HNO 3 + PAN + PPN). Significant differences were observed between the various study regions. In the lower 6 km of the troposphere over Alaska and the Hudson Bay lowlands of Canada a significant traction of the NOy budget (30 to 60 per cent) could not be accounted for by the measured Sigma NOy(i). This deficit in the NOy budget is about 100 to 200 parts per trillion by volume (pptv) in the lower troposphere (0. 15 to 3 km) and about 200 to 400 pptv in the middle free troposphere (3 to 6. 2 km). Conversely, the NOy budget in the northern Labrador and Quebec regions or Canada is almost totally accounted for within the combined measurement uncertainties of NOy and the various NOy(i) compounds. A substantial portion of the NOx budget's 'missing compounds' appears to be coupled to the photochemical and/or dynamical parameters influencing the tropospheric oxidative potential over these regions. A combination of factors are suggested as the causes for the variability observed in the NOy budget. In addition, the apparent stability of compounds represented by the NOy budget deficit in the lower-attitude range questions the ability of these compounds to participate as reversible reservoirs for "active" odd nitrogen and suggest that some portion of the NOy budget may consist of relatively unreactive nitrogencontaining compounds.

This paper also presents the evaluation of effect of ambient temperature, turbocharger compressor pressure ratio and effectiveness ofregenerator on the first and second law efficiencies of the system. The numerical computational analysis of the system indicates that the first and second law efficiencies are decreasing with ambient temperature as the increase in ambient temperature increases the charge intake temperature which leads to reduced work output and it finally results in reduced efficiencies. The decrease in first and second law efficiencies with effectiveness of regenerator is also due to similar reasons however these efficiencies increase with the increase of turbocharger compressor pressure ratio due to increase in the charge density at the inlet of the HCCI engine which further results in increase in power output of the engine and finally increase in efficiencies. A computational analysis has been done and the result so obtained is validated for HCCI engine with availableliterature at mean operating conditions and further waste heat from exhaust is utilized in organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and HRSG for combined production of power and heat.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} engine efficiency {{as well as to}} reduce emission, optimizing combustion is always the challenge in research and product development. Gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines have been popularized due to its higher power density, fuel efficiency, and the possibility for advanced engine technologies over conventional port-fuel-injection (PFI) gasoline engines. However, many issues are heavily investigated, such as air-fuel mixing preparation, fuel wall-wetting, higher HC and PM emissions, <b>catalytic</b> <b>convertor</b> efficiency, knocking, and pre-ignition. Besides, advanced technologies represent higher production cost. Because of the limited resource of petroleum-based fuels, ethanol is deemed as the alternative fuel for gasoline due to its availability, renewability, and fuel properties. It is also known for its lower energy content (LHV ~ 27 MJ/kg) that the fuel economy would decrease if such a fuel is used. Besides that, lower HC, CO, NOX, and PM emissions may be achieved with the presence of ethanol in fuel. The present study is focused on visualizing GDI combustion with different fuels (E 0 and E 85) along with engine-out emission measurement specially focusing on PM emission. Different engine operation conditions are taken into consideration to study the effects on engine performance in terms of engine start-up, combustion quality and variation, and engine-out emission. High speed imaging techniques are used for visualizing the combustion process, and high speed emission measurement devices are used for engine-out emission study. PM emission is the primary focus in the current study on emissions with the assistance of in-cylinder visualization to identify the location of diffusion flame where the soot is formed. CFD modeling is also implemented to analyze the air-fuel mixture preparation as well as the combustion process. The results indicate that the combustion process may not be ideal under certain operating conditions. By various image processing techniques, it is found that the flame kernel development could be either too slow or too heterogeneous. Fuel wall impingement is also found that pool fire is in inevitable in some cases that HC, CO, and PM emissions are high. Injection timing, ignition timing, and air-fuel ratio are the three primary factors that need to be carefully controlled for engine calibration in order to achieve higher efficiency and lower emissions. Some advanced technologies, e. g. one-valve deactivation, may not be ideal at certain speed and load. The use of alternative fuel could reduce PM emission in mass, but the particle number could sometimes be higher than using E 0. The CFD simulation also validates the similar results found from the experiments...|$|R
