2500|$|While on {{location}} in Nereju, Drăguș and Fundu Moldovei, he expanded the canon of anthropometry, and began recording blood type, investigated the presence and spread of syphilis, and provided free medical consultations to the peasants. Rainer and his specialist unit, including social hygienists, documented the squalid conditions of rural life. At Fundu Moldovei, {{where some of the}} villages were entirely cut off from the outside world, Rainer found that up to 50% of his samples showed contamination with syphilis, forcing him <b>to</b> <b>distribute</b> <b>reserves</b> of neosalvarsan. Stahl, who befriended Rainer in Fundu Moldovei, recalls that the stated purpose of Rainer's visit was an attempt to bridge physiology and sociology: [...] "he did not yet see what that connection might be, but any research should be carried out rigorously, so that, who knows, another generation, more skilled than we are, might come along and use it." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The recent {{proliferation}} of electric vehicles (EVs) {{has been a}} cause for reflection and intensified research in the field. EVs have a storied history {{just as long as}} gas-powered vehicles. However, lack of innovation has caused electric vehicles to endure long periods of disuse. New state-of-the-art designs have had impacts on society and EV manufactures. These new designs present new challenges to consumers wishing to use an electric vehicles and utilities wishing to alleviate this stress on the grid. With the large-scale integration of EVs, benefits to the frequency regulation of the power grid and improvements <b>to</b> the <b>distributed</b> spinning <b>reserve</b> of the power grid will be observed...|$|R
50|$|Before its closure {{due to a}} 1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission decision, {{the base}} was also used as a staging area and {{departure}} point for aircraft participating in the annual Chicago Air & Water Show. Following the 1993 BRAC decision, VP-60 and VP-90 were also slated for disestblishment and their respective P-3B aircraft either <b>distributed</b> <b>to</b> other <b>Reserve</b> patrol squadrons, identified for transfer to NATO and Allied military forces under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, or retired and mothballed. VR-51 was also disestablished concurrent with VP-60 and VP-90, with its C-9B aircraft similarly <b>distributed</b> <b>to</b> other VR squadrons or mothballed. In November 1997 a new squadron using the designation VR-51 was established as a Naval Air Reserve squadron at MCAS Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, where it currently operates C-20G Gulfstream IV aircraft. The majority of NAS Glenview's Naval Reserve reinforcing/sustaining units were also disestablished, with their reserve personnel either retiring from the Navy or transferring to other Regular Navy or Naval Reserve commands/units at other bases.|$|R
40|$|Background: Athletic competitions, {{such as the}} Tour de France, demand both {{momentary}} {{bursts of}} very high power output {{and the ability to}} provide high levels of energy expenditure for several weeks. As such, they provide a model of the ability for sustained muscular activity, which is important in terms of how humans are understood, not only as athletes, but also within an evolutionary context. Methods: Laboratory correlated HR responses were made of elite professional cyclists (N = 7) during successive competitions in one of the three grand tours in cycling in successive years, with the intent of evaluating the magnitude and pattern of energy expenditure. HR recordings were normalized into a training impulse (TRIMP) score, summating the intensity and duration of each race, and tracked over the duration of successive tours. Results: Although the day-by-day pattern of HR responses in exercise intensity zones associated with exercise intensities below the first ventilatory threshold, {{between the first and second}} ventilatory thresholds, and above the second ventilatory threshold varied in response to the course and competitive situation, the net accumulation of both time in each of the HR zones and TRIMP was remarkably constant from one tour to the next, both within the group at large as well as within individual athletes. The magnitude of accumulation of TRIMP was similar to that of previous reports on elite tour cyclists. Conclusions: We interpret these results as evidence that humans adopt a pacing strategy designed <b>to</b> optimally <b>distribute</b> energy <b>reserves</b> over the duration of each tour.

2500|$|In 1910, Méliès {{temporarily}} {{stopped making}} films {{in order to}} tour Europe with the stage magic spectacle Les Fantômes du Nil. Later that year, Star Films {{signed an agreement with}} the Gaumont Film Company <b>to</b> <b>distribute</b> all of its films. But in the autumn of 1910, Méliès made a deal with Charles Pathé that would eventually destroy his own film career. [...] Méliès accepted a large amount of money to produce films and in exchange Pathé Frères would <b>distribute</b> and <b>reserve</b> the right to edit these films. [...] Pathé also held the deed to both Méliès' home and his Montreuil studio as part of the deal. [...] Méliès immediately began production on more elaborate films and the two that he produced in 1911 were Baron Munchausen's Dream and The Diabolical Church Window. Despite the extravagance of these féeries that had been extremely popular just a decade before, both films failed financially.|$|R
