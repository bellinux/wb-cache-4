50|$|FADs are {{frequently}} used to designate segments in the geologic time scale. For example, {{the beginning of}} the <b>Tremadocian</b> <b>Stage</b> of the Ordovician Period is marked by the first appearance (FAD) of the conodont Iapetognathus fluctivagus in the geologic record. This occurs in bed 23 of the rock formation known as the Green Point section, located in western Newfoundland, as well as in geologically correlated strata {{in many parts of the}} world.|$|E
50|$|The {{boundary}} {{chosen for}} the beginning of both the Ordovician Period and the <b>Tremadocian</b> <b>stage</b> is highly significant. It correlates well with the occurrence of widespread graptolite, conodont, and trilobite species. The base (start) of the Tremadocian allows scientists to relate these species not only to each other, but also to species that occur with them in other areas. This makes it easier to place many more species in time relative {{to the beginning of the}} Ordovician Period.|$|E

40|$|The Lower Palaeozoic {{successions}} of Portugal {{are well}} {{represented in the}} Central Iberian Zone (Cll), {{one of the main}} tectonostratigraphic domains of the Iberian Massif. Located in the CIZ, the Bu<;aco Syncline presents one of its most complete Palaeozoic sequences. With a NW-SE orientation, the Lower Palaeozoic lithostratigraphic succession, includes several Ordovician units that ranges from the Lower Ordovician (<b>Tremadocian</b> <b>stage)</b> to the Upper Ordovician (Hirnantian stage) and are unconformably overlain by the Silurian Sazes Formation, at least of Wenlock and Ludlow epochs, in the Rio Ceira Section (Fig. 1). This sequence is also well known by its rich palaeontological content in macrofauna (e. g. trilobites, briozoans, echinoderms, ostracods, brachiopods, graptolites) and microfauna (conodonts, chitinozoans, acritarchs) (Delgado, 1908; Henry and Thadeu, 1971; Mitchell, 1974; Henry et al., 1974, 1976; ElaouadDebbaj, 1978; Henry, 1980; Paris, 1979, 1981; Romano, 1982; Romano et aI., 1986; Young, 1985, 1987, 1988, 1989) ...|$|E
40|$|The Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for Stage 2 of the Ordovician System, now the Floian Stage and {{approximately}} {{equivalent to the}} lower and middle Arenig of England and Wales, {{is defined by the}} first appearance datum (FAD) of the graptolite Tetragraptus approximatus in the Diabasbrottet Quarry section at Mount Hunneberg, Sweden. One of the issues this raises is how to correlate the base of Stage 2 at the GSSP with areas and successions that do not contain a correlative graptolite fauna. The distinctive Cymatiogalea messaoudensis–Stelliferidium trifidum acritarch assemblage is present in the upper Tremadocian Araneograptus murrayi Graptolite Biozone of NW England and ranges across the Tremadocian–Stage 2 boundary there (the Tremadoc–Arenig boundary of Anglo-Welsh nomenclature). It also occurs widely at other high southern Ordovician palaeolatitudes around the margin of Gondwana, being reported from Ireland, Wales, the Isle of Man, Belgium, Germany, Spain and Turkey, and may also be present in Bohemia and Argentina (Eastern Cordillera). It therefore has the potential to contribute towards the recognition and correlation of the base of Stage 2 in those areas. Of particular interest are the First Appearance Datums of various taxa within the stratigraphical range of the messaoudensis–trifidum assemblage, notably that of Aureotesta clathrata simplex, which is considered to be close to the base of Stage 2 in NW England. Elements of the messaoudensis–trifidum assemblage also occur in Baltica, the palaeoplate on which the GSSP for the base of Stage 2 is located. However, many of the taxa used to subdivide the messaoudensis–trifidum assemblage around Gondwana have not been recorded from Baltica and may be restricted palaeobiogeographically to the Gondwanan margin. Furthermore, acritarch microfloras have not been reported from the Diabasbrottet Quarry section itself, and there are hiatuses across the base of Stage 2 in the two sections from Baltica considered in this paper. Hence, direct correlation of the base of Stage 2 between the GSSP and other sections using acritarchs is not yet possible. Nevertheless, some taxa, for example the genera Peteinosphaeridium and Rhopaliophora, are shown to have FADs at similar stratigraphical levels in the late <b>Tremadocian</b> <b>Stage</b> of both Baltica and Gondwana, and therefore have the potential to correlate time slices in the late <b>Tremadocian</b> <b>Stage</b> between palaeoplates. ...|$|E
40|$|Veryhachium Deunff 1954, {{originally}} described {{from the}} Ordovician of western France, {{is one of}} the most frequently recorded acritarch genera. Over 250 species and subspecies, from the Cambrian to the Neogene, have been attributed to the genus. This genus has a simple morphology; it displays a triangular, rectangular, or polygonal central vesicle, with a few, simple processes drawn out from the angles of the vesicle in a single plane, and sometimes with supplementary or auxillary processes arising from the vesicle body. Veryhachium has been emended and revised numerous times. The number of valid species is excessive: most are probably synonyms. To facilitate effective classification, only a few morphological categories should be retained. For the Lower Paleozoic, the use of two informal groups is proposed. These are the Veryhachium trispinosum group for triangular specimens, and the Veryhachium lairdii group for rectangular forms. Although generally abundant and widespread throughout the Phanerozoic, Veryhachium is of limited biostratigraphic, paleoecologic, or paleogeographic value. However, its First Appearance Datum (FAD) is of great importance for Ordovician stratigraphy; the first Veryhachiirm morphotypes appear in the <b>Tremadocian</b> <b>Stage,</b> making the genus an important biostratigraphic marker...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT—The Antiklinalbugt Formation of {{northeast}} Greenland comprises peritidal to subtidal carbonate sediments, deposited in shallow shelf settings during an early Tremadocian transgressive-regressive megacycle. The succession of shales and microbial, muddy and grainy limestone, with minor dolostone {{at the base}} and top, terminates at the cryptic Fimbulfjeld disconformity. The formation has yielded trilobites collected on Ella Ø, Albert Heim Bjerge, and Kap Weber by C. Poulsen (1920 s and 1930 s), J. W. Cowie and P. J. Adams (1950 s), and during recent field studies in 2000 and 2001. The fauna includes dimeropygids Tulepyge cowiei and T. tesella n. spp., hystricurids Millardicurus and Hystricurus, and several species of Symphysurina. Micragnostus chiushuensis (Kobayashi, 1931) is rare, as are Chasbellus sp., Clelandia sp., and Lunacrania?. The presence of several Symphysurina species places the Antiklinalbugt Formation within the Symphysurina Zone. Chasbellus indicates the upper (lower Ordovician) part of the Symphysurina Zone for the lower upper Antiklinalbugt Formation. Conodonts place the middle lower formation in the Cordylodus intermedius conodont Biozone, the lower upper part in the Cordylodus angulatus conodont Biozone and the uppermost part in the Rossodus manitouensis conodont Biozone. This combined fauna is characteristic of the upper Skullrockian Stage of the Ibexian Series, with {{the lower part of}} the Antiklinalbugt Formation lying within the uppermost Cambrian of North America, and the upper part within the lower Ordovician. The entire formation lies within the global <b>Tremadocian</b> <b>Stage</b> of the early Ordovician...|$|E
