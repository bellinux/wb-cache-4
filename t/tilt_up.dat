25|$|Air Berlin {{long-haul}} aircraft featured business and economy class sections. At {{the beginning of}} 2012, Air Berlin started the renewal of its long-haul cabin, equipping both economy class and business class with new seats and a new in-flight entertainment system. Fully automatic seats that could <b>tilt</b> <b>up</b> to 170 degrees were provided in business class, along with an anti-thrombosis edition and an adjustable headrest, and more legroom and a narrower seat back in economy class. All seats have an 8.9-inch monitor with a touch screen and offer movies, series, music, audio books and games. In January 2013 the airline again presented a new business class which replaced the one introduced a year earlier. The new business class had single seats, offering travellers even more privacy. The new seats had a full-flat function, a massage function, and featured a 15-inch monitor.|$|E

500|$|Director Michael Lange {{felt the}} episode offered him {{excellent}} scope {{to try new}} techniques, noting that the series producers [...] "encourage cinematic stuff". He felt a highlight of this approach was in shooting the episode's climactic stand-off, explaining that [...] "instead of shooting at a normal eye level as the Salamander Man takes the gun, I <b>tilt</b> <b>up,</b> and now I'm shooting up his nose almost, {{and it was kind}} of like very disorienting. The show's got a certain ennui that appeals to me, the film noir-y movies of the '40s look, an undercurrent of tension and anxiety 'cause of all the weird things going on".|$|E
40|$|Tilting {{is known}} to cause changes in {{hemodynamics}} due to hydrostatic pressure. The present study is an analysis of changes in cerebral hemodynamics measured by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) following <b>tilting</b> <b>up</b> and down in preterm and term infants. A significantly different effect of <b>tilting</b> <b>up</b> in comparison to tilting down on total hemoglobin in preterm infants and on the 'hemoglobin oxygenation index' in preterm and term infants was observed. In preterm infants, <b>tilting</b> <b>up</b> and down had a significantly different effect on cerebral blood volume (CBV), with an increase after tilting down and a decrease after <b>tilting</b> <b>up.</b> In term infants, tilting had no significant effect on CBV comparing these two procedures. We think that MRS provides a good method to measure cerebral hemodynamics following tilting, whereby different reactions in infants of different postconceptional age can be observed.

Presently, the house door secretly opened, and they slowly and spitefully crept forth into the pouring rain. They were coming over to me (I thought) to demand satisfaction for my looking at the housekeeper, when they plunged into a recess in the architecture under my window and dragged out the puniest of little soldiers, begirt with the most innocent of little swords. The tall glazed head-dress of this warrior, Straudenheim instantly knocked off, and out of it fell two sugar-sticks, and three or four large lumps of sugar.|$|E
60|$|Night-shooting.--Tie a band {{of white}} paper round the muzzle of the gun, behind the sight. Mr. Andersson, who has had very great experience, ties the paper, not round the smooth barrel, but over the sight and all; and, if the sight does not {{happen to be a}} large one, he ties a piece of thick string round the barrel, or uses other similar contrivance, to <b>tilt</b> <b>up</b> the fore end of the paper. By this means, the paper is not entirely lost sight of at the moment when the aim is being taken. Mr. Andersson also pinches the paper into a ridge along the middle of the gun, to ensure a more defined foresight.|$|E
60|$|The {{engine was}} beating, the {{propeller}} spinning, {{and for a}} second the stage and the buildings beyond were gliding swiftly and horizontally past Graham's eye; then these things seemed to <b>tilt</b> <b>up</b> abruptly. He gripped the little rods {{on either side of him}} instinctively. He felt himself moving upward, heard the air whistle over the top of the wind screen. The propeller screw moved round with powerful rhythmic impulses--one, two, three, pause; one, two, three--which the engineer controlled very delicately. The machine began a quivering vibration that continued throughout the flight, and the roof areas seemed running away to starboard very quickly and growing rapidly smaller. He looked from the face of the engineer through the ribs of the machine. Looking sideways, there was nothing very startling in what he saw--a rapid funicular railway might have given the same sensations. He recognised the Council House and the Highgate Ridge. And then he looked straight down between his feet.|$|E

60|$|At last, however, {{supported}} by our hosts, we negotiated the wharf and gained the land. But {{the land was}} no better. The very first thing it did was to <b>tilt</b> <b>up</b> on one side, and {{far as the eye}} could see I watched it tilt, clear to its jagged, volcanic backbone, and I saw the clouds above tilt, too. This was no stable, firm-founded land, else it would not cut such capers. It was like all the rest of our landfall, unreal. It was a dream. At any moment, like shifting vapour, it might dissolve away. The thought entered my head that perhaps it was my fault, that my head was swimming or that something I had eaten had disagreed with me. But I glanced at Charmian and her sad walk, and even as I glanced I saw her stagger and bump into the yachtsman by whose side she walked. I spoke to her, and she complained about the antic behaviour of the land.|$|E

'Nothing in {{the world}} moved before his eyes, and he could depict to himself without {{hindrance}} the sudden swing upwards of the dark sky-line, the sudden <b>tilt</b> <b>up</b> of the vast plain of the sea, the swift still rise, the brutal fling, the grasp of the abyss, the struggle without hope, the starlight closing over his head for ever like the vault of a tomb--the revolt of his young life--the black end. He could! By Jove! who couldn't? And you must remember he was a finished artist in that peculiar way, he was a gifted poor devil {{with the faculty of}} swift and forestalling vision. The sights it showed him had turned him into cold stone from the soles of his feet to the nape of his neck; but there was a hot dance of thoughts in his head, a dance of lame, blind, mute thoughts--a whirl of awful cripples. Didn't I tell you he confessed himself before me as though I had the power to bind and to loose? He burrowed deep, deep, in the hope of my absolution, which would have been of no good to him. This was one of those cases which no solemn deception can palliate, where no man can help; where his very Maker seems to abandon a sinner to his own devices.|$|E
60|$|At {{that time}} {{the work on the}} St. Gothard Tunnel was going on, and that {{magnificent}} enterprise of burrowing was directly responsible for the unexpected building, standing all alone upon the very roots of the mountains. It was long though not big at all; it was low; it was built of boards, without ornamentation, in barrack-hut style, with the white window-frames quite flush with the yellow face of its plain front. And yet it was an hotel; it had even a name which I have forgotten. But there was no gold-laced door-keeper at its humble door. A plain but vigorous servant-girl answered our inquiries, then a man and woman who owned the place appeared. It was clear that no travellers were expected, or perhaps even desired, in this strange hostelry, which in its severe style resembled the house which surmounts the unseaworthy-looking hulls of the toy Noah's Arks, the universal possession of European childhood. However, its roof was not hinged and it was not full to the brim of slab-sided and painted animals of wood. Even the live tourist animal was nowhere in evidence. We had something to eat in a long, narrow room at one end of a long, narrow table, which, to my tired perception and to my sleepy eyes, seemed as if it would <b>tilt</b> <b>up</b> like a see-saw plank, since there was no one at the other end to balance it against our two dusty and travel-stained figures. Then we hastened upstairs to bed in a room smelling of pine planks, and I was fast asleep before my head touched the pillow.|$|E

He couldn't ever seem {{to tell the}} truth, {{in any kind of}} weather. Why, he would make you fairly shudder. He WAS the most scandalous liar! I left him, finally; I couldn't stand it. The proverb says, [...] "like master, like man;" [...] and if you stay with that kind of a man, you'll come under {{suspicion}} by and by, just as sure as you live. He paid first-class wages; but said I, What's wages when your reputation's in danger? So I let the wages go, and froze to my reputation. And I've never regretted it. Reputation's worth everything, ain't it? That's the way I look at it. He had more selfish organs than any seven men in the world--all packed in the stern-sheets of his skull, of course, where they belonged. They weighed down {{the back of his head}} so that it made his nose <b>tilt</b> <b>up</b> in the air. People thought it was vanity, but it wasn't, it was malice. If you only saw his foot, you'd take him to be nineteen feet high, but he wasn't; it was because his foot was out of drawing. He was intended to be nineteen feet high, no doubt, if his foot was made first, but he didn't get there; he was only five feet ten. That's what he was, and that's what he is. You take the lies out of him, and he'll shrink to the size of your hat; you take the malice out of him, and he'll disappear. That [...] "Cyclone" [...] was a rattler to go, and the sweetest thing to steer that ever walked the waters. Set her amidships, in a big river, and just let her go; it was all you had to do. She would hold herself on a star all night, if you let her alone. You couldn't ever feel her rudder. It wasn't any more labor to steer her than it is to count the Republican vote in a South Carolina election. One morning, just at daybreak, the last trip she ever made, they took her rudder aboard to mend it; I didn't know anything about it; I backed her out from the wood-yard and went a-weaving down the river all serene.
