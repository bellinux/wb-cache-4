If IgG 1 and <b>total</b> serum <b>protein</b> <b>concentrations</b> change with age, it becomes imperative to compare samples only from a narrow time period. Otherwise, differences {{might be due to}} age and not immune status. To help define this time period, blood was drawn from 10 beef calves when they were 1, 5, and 10 days of age.

5000|$|As {{described}} in the applications section, spectrophotometry {{can be used in}} both qualitative and quantitative analysis of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Qualitative analysis can be used and spectrophotometers are used to record spectra of compounds by scanning broad wavelength regions to determine the absorbance properties (the intensity of the color) of the compound at each wavelength. One experiment that can demonstrate the various uses that visible spectrophotometry can have is the separation of β-galactosidase from a mixture of various proteins. Largely spectrophotometry is best used to help quantify the amount of purification your sample has undergone relative to <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentration.</b> By running an affinity chromatography you can isolate B-Galactosidase and this can be tested by reacting collected samples with ONPG and determining if the sample turns yellow. Following this testing the sample at 420nm for specific interaction with ONPG and at 595 for a Bradford Assay the amount of purification can be assessed quantitatively. In addition to this spectrophotometry can be used in tandem with other techniques such as SDS-Page electrophoresis in order to purify and isolate various protein samples.|$|E
50|$|Once {{immunostaining}} {{has been}} performed protein expression must then be quantified. The signal levels {{can be obtained}} by using the reflective mode of an ordinary optical flatbed scanner if a colorimetric detection technique is used or by laser scanning, such as with a TECAN LS system, if fluorescent techniques are used. Two programs available online (P-SCAN and ProteinScan) can then be used to convert the scanned image into numerical values. These programs quantify signal intensities at each spot and use a dose interpolation algorithm (DI25) to compute a single normalized protein expression level value for each sample. Normalization is necessary to account for differences in <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentration</b> between each sample and so that antibody staining can be directly compared between samples. This can be achieved by performing an experiment in parallel in which total proteins are stained by colloidal gold total protein staining or Sypro Ruby total protein staining. When multiple RPMAs are analyzed, the signal intensity values can be displayed as a heat map, allowing for Bayesian clustering analysis and profiling of signaling pathways. An optimal software tool, custom designed for RPMAs is called Microvigene, by Vigene Tech, Inc.|$|E

Procedure-Serum IgG concentration {{was determined by}} use of single radial immunodiffusion, The following were determined: serum <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentration</b> as measured by refractometry (ie, refractometry serum <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentration),</b> serum <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentration</b> {{as determined by the}} biuret method (ie, biuret method serum <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentration),</b> serum gamma-globulin concentration as determined by serum protein electrophoresis, and serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity as measured by spectrophotometry. Accuracy of these assays for estimation of serum IgG concentration in 1 -day-old lambs was established by use of linear regression analysis. Results-Refractometry serum <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentration,</b> biuret method serum <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentration,</b> and serum gamma-globulin concentration were closely and linearly correlated with serum IgG concentration. The natural logarithm (In) of serum GGT activity was closely and linearly correlated with serum IgG concentration (In) Refractometry serum <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentration,</b> biuret method serum <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentration,</b> and gamma-globulin concentration accounted for approximately 85 %, 91 %, and 95 % of the variation in serum IgG concentration, respectively.

Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the cytokine expression levels in EBC with those in saliva, and to clarify the influence of saliva on cytokine measurements of EBC. Methods: EBC and saliva samples were obtained from 10 adult subjects with stable asthma. To estimate differences in the contents of substances between EBC and saliva, the <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentration</b> of each sample was measured. Further, we also measured the <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentration</b> of ELF obtained from another patient group with suspected lung cancer using a micro sampling probe during bronchoscopic examination and roughly estimated the dilution of EBC by comparing the <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentration</b> of EBC and ELF from those two patient groups.

Results: The mean total protein concentrations in EBC, saliva and ELF were 4. 6 µg/ml, 2, 398 µg/ml and 14, 111 µg/ml, respectively. The dilution of EBC could be estimated as 1 : 3000. Forty cytokines were analyzed by a cytokine protein array and each cytokine expression level of EBC was found to be different from that of saliva.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed chart data of 15 hypoalbuminemic patients who received continuous infusion of HA (100 g/d) for seven d following OLT and matched them with 15 control patients for severity scores at admission. Primary endpoint was a difference in mean "sequential organ failure assessment" (SOFA) score during 14 d following OLT. Secondary endpoints included SOFA subscores, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, ICU mortality, one-yr mortality, fluid balance, colloid osmotic pressure (COP), serum albumin, and <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentrations.</b> RESULTS: Substitution of HA was associated with a lower mean SOFA score as compared to control (11. 0 ± 3. 6 vs. 13. 4 ± 3. 7; p < 0. 001).
