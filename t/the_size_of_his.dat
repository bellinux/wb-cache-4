Some 1,400people mourned Dr. Crane at his funeral, more than double <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> congregation. After her husband's death, Mrs. Crane moved to Roseville, near Newark, leaving Stephen in the care of his older brother Edmund, with whom the young boy lived with cousins in Sussex County. He next lived with his brother William, a lawyer, in Port Jervis for several years.|$|E

His most famous victory was the Battle of Kircholm in 1605, in which he dealt a major defeat to a Swedish army three times <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own. He died {{on the front lines}} during the battle of Chocim, in the besieged Khotyn Fortress, {{a few days before the}} Ottomans gave up on the siege and agreed to negotiate.|$|E
5|$|Kiarostami's cinema {{offers a}} {{different}} definition of film. According to film professors such as Jamsheed Akrami, {{unlike many other}} contemporary filmmakers Kiarostami has consistently attempted to redefine film by forcing the audience's increased involvement. In recent years he has also progressively trimmed down <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> films, which Akrami believes reduces the film making experience from a collective endeavor to a purer, more basic form of artistic expression.|$|E

Schyster {{was not able}} to use much offense due to <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> opponent. He scored the win, however, when he shook the ropes as Mabel was about to attempt a maneuver from the top rope. Mabel fell to the mat, allowing I.R.S. to pin him.|$|E
5|$|With the Battle of Lewes, Montfort had won {{control of}} royal government, {{but after the}} {{defection}} of several close allies and the escape from captivity of Prince Edward, he found himself on the defensive. Forced to engage the royalists at Evesham, he faced an army twice <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own. The battle soon turned into a massacre; Montfort himself was killed and his body mutilated. Though the battle effectively restored royal authority, scattered resistance remained until the Dictum of Kenilworth was signed in 1267.|$|E

5000|$|Coles became {{president}} of Bowdoin in 1952 and served until 1968. Coles was the first president to build dorms for seniors and saw <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> student body, faculty, and campus grow dramatically. Notably, the Coles Tower, one of the tallest buildings in Maine, was built during his tenure. Originally known as the Senior Center, the 16-story building was an educational experiment that brought virtually the entire senior class into a single residence hall and made a senior seminar part of each semester's course offerings.|$|R

5|$|In 1838, the Presbyterian Church in Milton, Pennsylvania {{requested}} Waller's service, but he instead began preaching in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. He also preached in Wilkes-Barre and Lancaster in late 1838 and in Danville and Milton {{in early}} 1839. On May 1, 1839, he was ordained in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. His Presbyterian ministry began on a church on Third Street in Bloomsburg. When he began preaching, his ministry covered all of Columbia County, {{as well as}} an area from Danville to the Wyoming Valley. In 1840, he stopped preaching at Briar Creek and Berwick, as they became part of a separate ministry. In 1842, he began preaching in Orangeville and New Columbia. he preached in Espy since at least 1857. Due to <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ministry, he was never able to preach at a given church more than once every two weeks and only preached at most churches once a month. He typically traveled approximately 5000 miles per year to preach or conduct funerals. Initially his salary was $600.|$|E
5|$|John {{remained}} Lord of Ireland {{throughout his}} reign. He {{drew on the}} country for resources to fight his war with Philip on the continent. Conflict continued in Ireland between the Anglo-Norman settlers and the indigenous Irish chieftains, with John manipulating both groups to expand his wealth and power in the country. During Richard's rule, John had successfully increased <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> lands in Ireland, and he continued this policy as king. In 1210 the king crossed into Ireland with a large army to crush a rebellion by the Anglo-Norman lords; he reasserted his {{control of the country}} and used a new charter to order compliance with English laws and customs in Ireland. John stopped short of trying to actively enforce this charter on the native Irish kingdoms, but historian David Carpenter suspects that he might have done so, had the baronial conflict in England not intervened. Simmering tensions remained with the native Irish leaders even after John left for England.|$|E
5|$|The {{respective}} {{forces of}} the royal and baronial armies have been estimated to be 10,000 and 5,000 strong. Montfort, facing such unfavourable numbers, decided to concentrate his forces on {{the centre of the}} enemy’s front, hoping to drive a wedge through the line. Though the tactics were initially successful, the baronial forces soon lost the initiative, especially as the Welsh infantry provided by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd had proved unreliable, and deserted at an early point. The flanks of the royal army closed in on Montfort's, surrounding them. With Montfort confronted by a force twice <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own, on unfavourable ground, the battle rapidly turned into a massacre.|$|E

5|$|An ankle injury, which Brandon {{picked up}} in a {{pre-season}} tour game against Scottish side Motherwell kept Brandon {{out of the side}} {{at the start of the}} 2008–09 season. This included a League Cup game against his old side Huddersfield Town on 12 August 2008, for which he was a spectator as Bradford lost 4–0. When he attempted to make a comeback, he injured his other ankle in a reserve game with Scunthorpe United and was forced to undergo the first operation of his career which kept him out until January 2009. Once he returned to training in January, his first team debut was again delayed after a shoulder injury suffered at home. He returned to action for the reserves against Doncaster Rovers in February, before making his long-awaited debut on 7 March 2009 against Aldershot Town with City three goals ahead in a game which finally finished 5–0. He finished the season playing seven games. However, City missed out on promotion and Brandon's future was cast into doubt because of <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> contract and budget cuts at the club.|$|E
5|$|George R. R. Martin {{was already}} a {{successful}} fantasy and sci-fi author and TV writer before writing his A Song of Ice and Fire book series. Martin had published his first short story in 1971 and his first novel in 1977. By the mid-1990s, he had won three Hugo Awards, two Nebula Awards, and other awards for his short fiction. Although his early books were well received within the fantasy fiction community, his readership remained relatively small and Martin took on jobs as a writer in Hollywood in the mid-1980s. He worked principally on the revival of The Twilight Zone throughout 1986 and on Beauty and the Beast until 1990, but he also developed his own TV pilots and wrote feature film scripts. He grew frustrated that his pilots and screenplays were not getting made and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes. This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where {{he did not have}} to worry about compromising <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> imagination. Admiring the works of J. R. R. Tolkien in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas.|$|E
5|$|On 24 April, {{the first}} {{prisoner}} {{escaped from the}} main camp; {{the same day that}} the injured second prisoner was taken in by Machuca and his men. Interrogation of the new prisoner, {{who turned out to be}} an Itza nobleman, revealed that the Itza kingdom was in a state of high alert to repel the Spanish. Friar Cano met with his fellow Dominicans to discuss what should be done, having had information from both Machuca and his prisoner that the Itza were ready for war. The Dominicans were highly critical of the Spanish soldiers' readiness to open fire on poorly armed natives who offered no real threat to them, and suspected that President Barrios was nowhere near the lake; furthermore the Spanish were beginning to succumb to sickness, and the Verapaz Indian recruits were deserting daily. Díaz agreed with the Dominicans; two muleteers had already died from sickness, and he recognised that <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> expedition was not sufficient for a full confrontation with the Itza nation. The expedition almost immediately withdrew back to Cahabón. The new prisoner, AjK'ixaw was later taken back to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, where the Dominicans questioned him in detail. In Guatemala AjK'ixaw learnt Spanish and returned to Petén in 1696 as a guide and interpreter for another expedition, before turning on his captors. After the Spanish retreated to Guatemala, rumours ran rife among the Itza and Kowoj that they would return to engage in wholesale slaughter of the Maya population; large tracts of territory were abandoned in response, including many towns in an area stretching from Lake Petén Itzá eastwards to Tipuj and southwards to Mopán.|$|E

60|$|I have {{recommended}} {{that as a}} rule the shelves be fixed, and have given reasons for the adoption of such a rule. I {{do not know whether}} it will receive the sanction of authorities. And I make two admissions. First, it requires that each person owning and arranging a library should have a pretty accurate general knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> books. Secondly, it may be expedient to introduce here and there, by way of exception, a single movable shelf; and this, I believe, will be found to afford a margin sufficient to meet occasional imperfections in <b>the</b> computation <b>of</b> <b>sizes.</b> Subject to these remarks, I have considerable confidence in the recommendation I have made.|$|R
