McMillen had been inspired by Shigeru Miyamoto, the designer of the original Zelda games.|$|E

5|$|The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith was not {{the only}} film in which Dodd {{appeared}} <b>that</b> <b>addressed</b> topical Indigenous issues of the day. A decade after Jimmie Blacksmith, Dodd performed in Ground Zero, again with Jack Thompson in one of the lead roles.

The film uses as its context the McClelland Royal Commission, which was investigating radioactive contamination at the site. In the film, Dodd plays a minor character named Freddy Tjapaljarri.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Cleave's article {{appeared}} in the Evening Standard, Beatles press officer Tony Barrow offered Datebook, a US teen magazine, rights to all four interviews. Barrow believed the pieces were important to show fans that the Beatles were progressing beyond simple pop music and producing more intellectually challenging work. As Datebook was a socially progressive magazine <b>that</b> <b>addressed</b> subjects such as interracial dating and legalization of marijuana, {{it seemed like a}} suitable vehicle to carry this information.|$|E

The Rockets and White came to an agreement regarding travel, including allowing White travel by personal bus rather than flying (which has been an anxiety trigger in the past for white).

5|$|With {{the units}} in the rear, the only {{communications}} method was via the intercom. Contemporary systems used the radio as the intercom as well, but the TR9D sets used in RAF aircraft used the voice channel for 15 seconds every minute for the pip-squeak system, blocking communications. Even when modified sets were supplied <b>that</b> <b>addressed</b> this, the radar was found to interfere strongly with the intercom. A speaking tube was tried but found to be useless. Newer VHF radios being developed through this same period did not suffer these problems, and the Blenheims were moved {{to the front of}} the queue to receive these units.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} after 1590 the cousins William Louis and Maurice of Nassau, stadtholders and captains-general of Friesland and Groningen, {{respectively}} the remaining provinces, introduced important tactical reforms that would be copied by other European armies, thereby engendering a tactical Military Revolution {{in the first half}} of the 17th century. The problem they tried to solve was that the lack of uniformity in armaments and tactical skills of the mercenary formations they hired on the open market made coordinated fighting difficult. In addition the dominant tactics of the time had been developed by their opponents, the Spanish commanders, and these favored the Spanish troops (who were well-drilled in them) over their imitators. What they needed was a new tactical conception <b>that</b> <b>addressed</b> the weaknesses in the Spanish tactics. Starting in 1596 they introduced a number of reforms <b>that</b> <b>addressed</b> both problems.|$|E
