Apparently, Hsu was soliciting investors for a [...] "bridge loan" [...] operation that returned approximately 6% every 3 months.

When Winmark purchased the company, it had 42 stores. Winmark renamed the used CD store to Disc Go Round {{because they could not}} nationally trademark the name [...] "CD Exchange". The outlet had an electronic system that recorded all the CDs a store had so customers did not have to browse the shelves <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> a particular CD was present. Disc Go Around also had [...] "listening stations" [...] for customers to listen to CDs. Winmark sold Disc Go Round, which had increased to 137 stores, to CD Warehouse on June 26, 1998, for $7.4 million.|$|E

At least nine doctors were under investigation. The police wanted to question 30 doctors, nurses, and pharmacists, including Arnold Klein.

2500|$|The {{researchers}} {{explain these}} apparently inexcusable inadequacies in experimental protocols by drawing {{a clear distinction}} between two different stages of an investigation: the exploratory, informal experiments and the formal experiments. During the exploratory phase, the researchers would simply be <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> there is a phenomenon that could be worth further investigation, which often implies the use of much more complicated protocols and expensive equipment. In doing so, they are also trying to set up a comfortable, relaxed atmosphere that is believed to be conducive to psychic phenomena.

2500|$|Larry Laudan has {{suggested}} pseudoscience has no scientific meaning and is mostly {{used to describe}} our emotions: [...] "If we would {{stand up and be}} counted on the side of reason, we ought to drop terms like 'pseudo-science' and 'unscientific' from our vocabulary; they are just hollow phrases which do only emotive work for us". Likewise, Richard McNally states, [...] "The term 'pseudoscience' has become little more than an inflammatory buzzword for quickly dismissing one's opponents in media sound-bites" [...] and [...] "When therapeutic entrepreneurs make claims on behalf of their interventions, we should not waste our time <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> their interventions qualify as pseudoscientific. Rather, we should ask them: How do you know that your intervention works? What is your evidence?" ...|$|E

On October 16, 2006, FBI agents raided the home of Weldon's daughter as well as five other locations of Weldon associates in Pennsylvania and Florida {{as part of the}} investigation. According to an article in the October 17, 2006, edition of The New York Times, [...] "investigators are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> Mr. Weldon misused his official position to help his daughter’s company obtain lobbying contracts from foreign clients and helped steer contracts to favored firms."

In so doing, Forrestal and the C-130 set a record for the largest and heaviest airplane landing on a Navy aircraft carrier. The Navy was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> the big Hercules could serve as a [...] "Super-COD", or [...] "Carrier Onboard Delivery" [...] aircraft.

2500|$|The {{passage is}} {{difficult}} to interpret {{and there is little}} consensus about many of the details. [...] has argued that this may be because Aristotle did not use the term as a standardized technical term at all. For example, in some passages in his works, Aristotle seems to use the term to refer to the individual sense perceptions simply being common to all people, or common to various types of animals. There is also difficulty with <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> the common sense is truly separable from the individual sense perceptions and from imagination, in anything other than a conceptual way as a capability. Aristotle never fully spells out the relationship between the common sense and the imaginative faculty ("phantasia"), although the two clearly work together in animals, and not only humans, for example in order to enable a perception of time. They may even be the same. Despite hints by Aristotle himself that they were united, early commentators such as Alexander of Aphrodisias and Al-Farabi felt they were distinct, but later, Avicenna emphasized the link, influencing future authors including Christian philosophers. [...] argues that Aristotle used the term [...] "common sense" [...] both to discuss the individual senses when these act as a unity, which Gregorić calls [...] "the perceptual capacity of the soul", or the higher level [...] "sensory capacity of the soul" [...] that represents the senses and the imagination working as a unity. According to Gregorić, there {{appears to have been a}} standardization of the term koinē aisthēsis as a term for the perceptual capacity (not the higher level sensory capacity), which occurred by the time of Alexander of Aphrodisias at the latest.|$|E
60|$|But Bunny was not asleep. He was thinking. He {{was trying}} to make up his mind about something. There was no way of finding out what it was that he {{was trying to}} make up his mind about.

Or he might have been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> it would be better for him to go over to 'Lijah Ford's garden, and try to get a bite at some cabbage-leaves; or to run down to the field just outside of the woods, where he would very likely meet a certain little girl rabbit that he knew very well.|$|E
