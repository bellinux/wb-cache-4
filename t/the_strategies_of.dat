40|$|Summary. In the {{beginning}} of the article is defined a rational sequence of the consideration of <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>of</b> a company development, included into an integrated structure. Further the article describes the following items separately: "a strategy", "a development of a company", and "an integrational structure", applying them to companies included to the integrated structure; separating them from a <b>strategy</b> <b>of</b> development of an autonomous company. The article defines functions which such strategy must define, taking into consideration <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company development, included into an integrated structure. Next, the article defines six steps which describe a sequence <b>of</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company development, included into an integrated structure. The analysis which is defined in the article allows determining a complete definition <b>of</b> essence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company development, included into an integrated structure. The article also defines a place <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>of</b> development into <b>the</b> hierarchical structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strategies.</b> <b>The</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company development, included into an integrated structure (as well as <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>of</b> development of an autonomous company) [...] is a competition strategy, and it separates "strategy of leadership for costs", “differentiation strategy”, and “strategy of focusing for costs”. Also authors are analyzed <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cost optimization. According to the complex definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strategy,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>strategy's</b> place inside <b>the</b> hierarchical structure, the article defines functions which corporate, competitive, and functional <b>strategies</b> execute during <b>the</b> management of companies inside an integrational structure. The article presents characteristics of applied strategic decisions at different levels of all three types <b>of</b> <b>strategies.</b> <b>The</b> article's researches allow companies included to the integrated structure define their place inside the integration structure, and a character of communication with the direction of this structure during the process development and implementation <b>of</b> their own <b>strategy...</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{terms of}} {{relations}} with the Pope, Domagoj acted differently from his predecessor Trpimir. There is no information that Domagoj built a church or donated property to a local diocese. Unlike Trpimir, Branimir and his wife Maruša, Pannonian Duke Braslav, and Trpimir's sons Petar and Zdeslav, Domagoj did not conduct a pilgrimage to Cividale and was not registered in the Evangelistary of Cividale. Domagoj made no attempts to continue the spreading of the Gospel or to support the Church in such efforts. This period of cold relations forced the Pope to show more interest into Croatia, but also in other countries where his influence was fading. Thus {{in the second half}} of the 9th century Roman interventions became more intense in Moravia, Bulgaria and Dalmatia. <b>The</b> <b>strategies</b> <b>of</b> the Apostolic See were to maximize its influence in Southeastern Europe and to lower the influence of Constantinople.|$|E
25|$|In the past, simple {{game theory}} models, {{such as the}} classic {{cooperative}} hunting and Prisoner's dilemma models, {{were used to determine}} decisions made by animals in cooperative relationships. However, complicated interactions between animals have required the use of more complex economic models such as the Nash equilibrium. The Nash equilibrium is a type of non-cooperative game theory that assumes an individual's decision is influenced by its knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>strategies</b> <b>of</b> other individuals. This theory was novel because it took into consideration the higher cognitive capabilities of animals. The evolutionarily stable strategy is a refined version of the Nash equilibrium in that it assumes strategies are heritable and are subject to natural selection. Economic models are useful for analyzing cooperative relationships because they provide predictions on how individuals act when cooperation is an option. Economic models are not perfect, but they provide a general idea of how cooperative relationships work.|$|E

Apart from studying literature under his father Yue He (岳和), Yue Fei loved to read military classics. He favored the Zuo Zhuan commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals and <b>the</b> <b>strategies</b> <b>of</b> Sun Tzu and Wu Qi. Although his literacy afforded him the chance to become a scholar, which was a position held in much higher regard than the common soldiery during the Song dynasty, Yue chose the military path because {{there had never been}} any tradition of civil service in his family. Therefore he had no reason to study Confucian classics in order to surpass the accomplishments of his ancestors or to raise his family's social status to the next level. His fourth generation ancestor, Yue Huan (岳渙), had served as a lingshi (令使) (essentially a low-level functionary), but he was never a full-fledged member of the civil service rank. A second theory is that he joined the military in the hopes of emulating his favorite heroes.|$|E
