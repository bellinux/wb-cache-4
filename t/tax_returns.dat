50|$|Legally, a tax payer is {{obliged to}} submit a <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> when HMRC request one by sending a notice to file a <b>tax</b> <b>return,</b> either because the tax payer has {{registered}} for self assessment voluntarily or because HMRC believe one to be required - HMRC can request a <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> from anyone for any reason.|$|R
50|$|The Registered <b>Tax</b> <b>Return</b> Preparer Test {{was a test}} {{produced}} by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Until the program was suspended in January 2013, the IRS had implemented rules requiring that certain individuals who wanted to work as <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> preparers pass this test to demonstrate their ability to understand U.S. tax law, tax form preparation and ethical requirements. The competency test {{was part of an}} agency effort to better regulate the <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> preparation industry, to improve the accuracy of <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> preparation and to improve service to taxpayers. Candidates who passed the test, a tax compliance check, and met certain other requirements had a new designation: Registered <b>Tax</b> <b>Return</b> Preparer.|$|R
25|$|The {{argument}} {{that a person}} is not required to file a <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> or pay <b>tax</b> unless the Internal Revenue Service responds to the person's questions, etc., and variations of this argument, have been officially identified as legally frivolous Federal <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> positions for purposes of the $5,000 frivolous <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> penalty imposed under Internal Revenue Code section 6702(a).|$|R

With a hidden microphone under his shirt, Homer uncovers that his coworker Charlie is leading a group planning to assault all government officials, but is arrested by the FBI for conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|By 1525, Reading was {{the largest}} town in Berkshire, and <b>tax</b> <b>returns</b> show that Reading was the 10th largest town in England when {{measured}} by taxable wealth. By 1611, it had a population of over 5000 and had grown rich on its trade in cloth. The town was seriously affected by the English Civil War, with a major siege and loss of trade, and {{played a pivotal role}} in the Revolution of 1688, with that revolution's only significant military action fought {{on the streets of the}} town.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 federal {{prosecutors}} reviewed evidence that Jackson faced potential criminal liability for misuse of her husband's campaign funds; allegedly {{she and the}} Congressman used campaign funds to decorate their Washington, DC home.

To maintain the designation, a Registered <b>Tax</b> <b>Return</b> Preparer was required to complete 15 hours of continuing education courses each year and renew his or her PTIN annually. Finally, the Registered <b>Tax</b> <b>Return</b> Preparer was required to adhere to ethical standards set out by the Department of Treasury's Circular 230.|$|R

5|$|In 2015 an {{attorney}} for Caspersen’s estate stated Caspersen’s <b>tax</b> <b>returns</b> for 2005-2008 had been audited, in an investigation that did not conclude until 2013. The attorney, Denis Conlon, stated that the net result of the four-year audit was a $7,000 refund from the government for overpayment in one year, $14,000 of additional tax due for another year (in which Caspersen had over $2.7 million of income), no refunds or additional taxes dues for the other two years, and no fines or penalties imposed for alleged offshore accounts or other conduct.|$|E
5|$|McCain {{clinched}} enough delegates for {{the nomination}} and his focus shifted toward the general election, while Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton fought a prolonged battle for the Democratic nomination. McCain introduced various policy proposals, and sought to improve his fundraising. Cindy McCain, who accounts {{for most of the}} couple's wealth with an estimated net worth of $100million, made part of her <b>tax</b> <b>returns</b> public in May. After facing criticism about lobbyists on staff, the McCain campaign issued new rules in May 2008 to avoid conflicts of interest, causing five top aides to leave.|$|E
5|$|The Sandals farm {{contains}} three cottages {{dated to}} the 17th century. Heather Cottage is another 17th-century cottage, with 20th-century {{additions to the}} rear, on Worldham Hill, noted for its thatched roof. It {{is believed to be}} named after William Heather, a resident mentioned in the 1665 Hearth <b>Tax</b> <b>returns.</b> It became a listed building on 18 July 1986. The Three Horseshoes Public House was first licensed in 1834 {{and is one of the}} main features of the village. It was rebuilt some 50 years later by Henry Newman. Also of note is the Rectory House on Wyck Lane, and the Oast House, just to the west of the rectory.|$|E
40|$|We {{simulate}} marginal {{tax rates}} (MTRs) from 1998 to 2000 using U. S. <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> data for public corporations. We compare these tax rates to those calculated from public financial statement data {{and find that}} Graham’s (1996 a) simulated tax rate is the book variable most highly correlated with the simulated <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> rate. We provide an algorithm to approximate the <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> MTR if the book simulated rate is not available. Finally, we find that <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> MTRs are significantly correlated with financial statement corporate debt ratios, although less so than the correlation between book MTRs and debt ratios...|$|R

5|$|After Corzine's breakup with Katz, {{their lawyers}} {{negotiated}} a financial payout in November 2004. According to press accounts, the settlement for Katz exceeded $6million, including cash (in part {{used to buy}} her $1.1million condominium in Hoboken), a college trust fund to educate her children, a 2005 Volvo sport utility vehicle, and Corzine forgave a $470,000 loan he had made to Katz in 2002 to buy out her ex-husband's share of their home in Alexandria Township. Katz enrolled in Seton Hall University School of Law on a full scholarship in 2004. Corzine later acknowledged he had given $15,000 to Katz's brother-in-law, Rocco Riccio, a former state employee who {{was forced to resign}} after being accused of examining income <b>tax</b> <b>returns</b> for political purposes. At the time, Katz was president of the CWA Local 1034, which bargains on behalf of many state employees.|$|E
5|$|In April 1979, McCain met Cindy Lou Hensley, {{a teacher}} from Phoenix, Arizona, whose father had founded a large beer distributorship. They began dating, and he urged his wife Carol to grant him a divorce, {{which she did}} in February 1980; the uncontested divorce took effect in April 1980. The {{settlement}} included two houses, and financial support for her ongoing medical treatments due to her 1969 car accident; they would remain on good terms. McCain and Hensley were married on May 17, 1980, with Senators William Cohen and Gary Hart attending as groomsmen. McCain's children did not attend, and several years would pass before they reconciled. John and Cindy McCain entered into a prenuptial agreement that kept most of her family's assets under her name; they would always keep their finances apart and file separate income <b>tax</b> <b>returns.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other {{candidates}} in the Democratic field included sitting lieutenant governor Thelma Stovall, Terry McBrayer (the choice of sitting governor Julian Carroll), congressman Carroll Hubbard, state auditor George Adkins, and Louisville mayor Harvey Sloane. Initially the leading candidate, Stovall was hampered during the campaign by ill health. During the campaign, Brown was attacked by McBrayer for refusing to release his federal <b>tax</b> <b>returns.</b> McBrayer also claimed that Brown had not voted in a Democratic primary since 1975, a charge validated by public voting records. Nevertheless, Brown won the primary {{by a margin of}} 25,000 votes. The race was so close that Sloane, Brown's closest competitor, refused to concede for two days. Brown defeated former Republican governor Louie B. Nunn in the 1979 general election by a vote of 554,083 to 376,809.|$|E
50|$|People and organisations {{in these}} {{categories}} may {{still need to}} submit a <b>tax</b> <b>return,</b> but generally speaking these exemptions mean those not needing to submit a <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> don't {{need to get a}} tax file number.|$|R
50|$|The Form 1040NR, U.S. Nonresident Alien Income <b>Tax</b> <b>Return,</b> and its shorter version Form 1040NR-EZ, U.S. Income <b>Tax</b> <b>Return</b> for CertainNonresident Aliens With No Dependents, {{are used}} by nonresident aliens who have U.S. source income and {{therefore}} have to file a U.S. <b>tax</b> <b>return.</b> Joint returns are not permitted, so that husband and wife must each file a separate return. The Form 1040NR-EZ can be used under conditions similar to those for the 1040EZ form.|$|R
5000|$|For {{purposes}} of the registration requirement, the IRS had defined a [...] "tax return preparer" [...] as [...] "an individual who, for compensation, prepares all or substantially all of a federal <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> or claim for refund." [...] Beginning in mid-2011, <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> preparers (other than CPAs, attorneys, and enrolled agents and a few others) had generally been required to take and pass a competency test to become a registered <b>tax</b> <b>return</b> preparer.|$|R
5|$|Polls {{consistently}} {{indicated a}} tight {{race for the}} November general election. Negative ads from both sides dominated the campaign, with Obama's proclaiming that Romney shipped jobs overseas while at Bain Capital and kept money in offshore tax havens and Swiss bank accounts. A related issue dealt with Romney's purported responsibility for actions at Bain Capital after taking the Olympics post. Romney faced demands from Democrats to release additional years of his <b>tax</b> <b>returns,</b> an action a number of Republicans also felt would be wise; after being adamant {{that he would not}} do that, he released summaries of them in late September. During May and June, the Obama campaign spent heavily and was able to paint a negative image of Romney in voters' minds before the Romney campaign could construct a positive one.|$|E
5|$|The Justice Department {{filed the}} charges on February 15, 2013, and Jackson pleaded guilty on February 20, 2013 to {{one count of}} wire and mail fraud in {{connection}} with his misuse of $750,000 of campaign funds. On June 7, 2013, federal prosecutors indicated that they sought a four-year prison sentence for Jackson. On August 14, 2013, Jackson was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison, while wife Sandi was sentenced to 12 months in prison for filing false <b>tax</b> <b>returns</b> in attempt to conceal the crimes. The two sentences did not run concurrently. Rather, Jackson initially served prison time and upon his release, his wife was to begin her prison sentence shortly thereafter. The staggered sentences allowed for the Jackson children {{to have access to}} at least one parent during the time each is in prison.|$|E
5|$|There {{are almost}} no {{reliable}} sources {{with which to}} track the population of Scotland before the late seventeenth century. Estimates based on English records suggest {{that by the end}} of the Middle Ages the Black Death and subsequent recurring outbreaks of the plague may have caused the population of Scotland to fall as low as half a million people. Price inflation, which generally reflects growing demand for food, suggests that this probably expanded in the first half of the sixteenth century, levelling off after the famine of 1595, as prices were relatively stable in the early seventeenth century. Calculations based on Hearth <b>Tax</b> <b>returns</b> for 1691 indicate a population of 1,234,575. This level may have been seriously effected by the famines of the 1690s. The first reliable information available on national population is from the census conducted by the Reverend Alexander Webster in 1755, which showed the inhabitants of Scotland as 1,265,380 persons.|$|E
