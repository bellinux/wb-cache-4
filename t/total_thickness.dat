A U-shaped structure located at the downstream toe of the dam, its excavation was completed in late 1933 with the first concrete placed in November 1933.

The powerhouse was one of the projects uncompleted {{at the time of the}} formal dedication on September 30, 1935—a crew of 500men remained to finish it and other structures.

5|$|The M2 Light Tank {{led to the}} US M3-series and M5-series light tanks. The Ordnance Department {{viewed the}} M2A4 as a stopgap tank; work to improve it further began in June 1940. The first M3 Stuart tanks began to be {{produced}} in March 1941; the original riveted M3s closely resembled the M2A4, and the two types occasionally served in the same units; the easiest recognition feature is the rear idler wheel. On the M2A4, the idler is raised; on the M3 it trails on the ground, increasing the flotation of the heavier vehicle. The M3 retained the same Continental W-670 engine, but incorporated ½-inch thicker (1½ inch <b>total</b> <b>thickness)</b> armor; weight increased to 14 tons. The tank initially kept the same 37mm gun and the forward firing hull machine guns, but the turret incorporated improvements. Eventually over 4,500 examples of all variants were produced.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Establishing and obtaining {{consistent}} quantitative {{indices of}} retinal thickness {{from a variety}} of clinically used Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography scanners. DESIGN: Retinal images from five Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography scanners were used to determine <b>total</b> retinal <b>thickness</b> with scanner-specific correction factors establishing consistency of thickness measurement across devices. PARTICIPANTS: 55 Fovea-centered Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography volumes from eleven subjects were analyzed, obtained from Cirrus HD-OCT, RS- 3000, Heidelberg Spectralis, RTVue and Topcon 2000, seven subjects with retinal diseases and four normal controls. METHOD: The Iowa Reference Algorithm measured <b>total</b> retinal <b>thickness.</b> Nonlinear model of <b>total</b> retinal <b>thickness</b> measurement comparisons was derived and used for device-specific comparisons. Bland-Altman plots and pairwise predictive equations yielded pairwise scanner-specific differences. Mendel test determined whether measurement biases were constant for each scanner pair. RESULTS: Mendel test revealed that all pairwise scanner differences of <b>total</b> retinal <b>thickness</b> were constant across the cohort (p= 0. 992). Individual measurements can thus be bias-corrected and the Iowa Reference Algorithm serve as a scanner-agnostic independent standard of <b>total</b> retinal <b>thickness</b> across the five tested SD-OCT scanners. CONCLUSIONS: Combination of the Iowa Reference Algorithm with scanner-specific bias correction yields cross-scanner consistency of <b>total</b> retinal <b>thickness</b> measurements, facilitating scanning-device independent quantitative assessment of <b>total</b> retinal <b>thickness,</b> longitudinal follow-up quantification without requiring patients to be imaged on the same scanner model, and allowing for multi-center studies with heterogeneous device utilization when using the Iowa Reference Algorithm.

40|$|Purpose: To {{characterize}} the epithelial, stromal, and <b>total</b> corneal <b>thickness</b> profile {{in a population}} of eyes with keratoconus. Methods: Epithelial, stromal, and <b>total</b> corneal <b>thickness</b> profiles were measured in vivo by Artemis very high-frequency (VHF) digital ultrasound scanning (ArcScan) across the central 6 - to 10 -mm diameter of the cornea on 54 keratoconic eyes. Maps of the average, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and range of epithelial, stromal, and <b>total</b> corneal <b>thickness</b> were plotted. The average location of the thinnest epithelium, stroma, and total cornea were found. The crosssectional semi-meridional stromal and <b>total</b> corneal <b>thickness</b> profiles were calculated using annular averaging. The absolute stromal and <b>total</b> corneal <b>thickness</b> progressions relative to the thinnest point were calculated using annular averaging {{as well as for}} 8 semi-meridians individually. Results: The mean corneal vertex epithelial, stromal, and <b>total</b> corneal <b>thicknesses</b> were 45. 7 ± 5. 9 μm, 426. 4 ± 38. 5 μm and 472. 2 ± 41. 4 μm respectively. The average epithelial thickness profile showed an epithelial doughnut pattern characterized by localized central thinning surrounded by an annulus of thick epithelium. The thinnest epithelium, stroma, and total cornea were displaced on average by 0. 48 ± 0. 66 mm temporally and 0. 32 ± 0. 67 mm inferiorly, 0. 31 ± 0. 45 mm temporally and 0. 54 ± 0. 37 mm inferiorly, and 0. 31 ± 0. 43 mm temporally and 0. 50 ± 0. 35 mm inferiorly, respectively, with reference to the corneal vertex. The increase in semimeridional absolute stromal and <b>total</b> corneal <b>thickness</b> progressions was greatest inferiorly and lowest temporally. Conclusions: Three-dimensional thickness mapping of the epithelial, stromal, and <b>total</b> corneal <b>thickness</b> profiles characterized thickness changes associated with keratoconus and may help in early diagnosis of keratoconus...|$|R
40|$|FSmall {{pyrex glass}} spheres were {{launched}} int aluminum double-sheet targets at velocities to 8. 8 km/sec {{to determine the}} effects of <b>total</b> sheet <b>thickness</b> and sheet spacing upon penetration resistance. The ballistic limit of double-sheet structures consisting of two equally thick aluminum sheets was found to increase with increasing <b>total</b> sheet <b>thickness</b> and sheet spacing. In addition, for a particular ratio of <b>total</b> sheet <b>thickness</b> to projectile diameter, the effectiveness of sheet spacing increases with increasing impact velocity. This effect is attributed to melting and vaporization of the projectile and front-sheet material, and it is concluded that this trend will continue as material vaporization becomes more dominant. The data of this report are used to establish the effectiveness of <b>total</b> sheet <b>thickness</b> and a lower limit for the effectiveness of sheet spacing. It was determined that the structural ballistic limit varies with the 2. 5 power of the ratio of the <b>total</b> sheet <b>thickness</b> to the projectile diameter and with at least the square of the ratio of the sheet spacing to the projectile diameter...|$|R

25|$|When a {{piece of}} {{lithosphere}} that was heated and stretched cools again, its density rises, causing isostatic subsidence. If this subsidence continues long enough, the basin is called a sag basin.

In sag basins, the extra weight of the newly deposited sediments is enough to keep the subsidence going in a vicious circle.
