However, although bearing the same names, the boundaries of Flintshire and Denbighshire were substantially {{different from those of}} the earlier counties. As it happened, the county records for historic Flintshire had been retained at the Hawarden branch of the Clwyd Records Office while those for historic Denbighshire had continued to be held at the Ruthin branch, so <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> in segregating the records.|$|E

500|$|One flaw in Peale's medal {{business}} was {{his need to}} acquire gold and silver bullion within the Mint. [...] This was paid for once the medal sold, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> while the Melter and Refiner of the Philadelphia Mint was Peale's friend Jonas R. McClintock. [...] But in 1846, McClintock resigned {{and was replaced by}} Richard Sears McCulloh. [...] At first, McCulloh gave Peale whatever gold and silver he needed without question, but came to object to doing so. [...] Peale and McCulloh made a deal whereby the struck medal would remain in McCulloh's custody until Peale had replaced the bullion, but Peale objected that the procedure was [...] "inconvenient". [...] Beginning in August 1849, McCulloh refused further requests from Peale for bullion, and Peale instead gained it from the Mint's Treasurer.|$|E

500|$|On 22 April 1983, just as Waller and Maxwell {{were about}} to officially {{announce}} the merger, Tranter's solicitors handed Waller a High Court injunction temporarily blocking sale of the disputed stock. Three days later, the High Court imposed a further injunction preventing any dealing in Reading shares until a further hearing on 3 May. Maxwell insisted that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem,</b> calling the legal challenge a [...] "side show"; he made a fresh bid to all of Reading's shareholders. On 1 May, the Oxford chairman told the press {{that he and his}} supporters at Reading controlled 40% of the shares. Meanwhile, Oxford City Council offered Oxford United a new [...] "£6million sports complex" [...] in the western suburb of Botley. Maxwell said that he was still pursuing the merger with Reading, but would look into the Botley proposal.|$|E
2500|$|The oldest Jewish religio-philosophical work {{preserved}} {{is that of}} Saadia Gaon (892-942), Emunot ve-Deot, [...] "The Book of Beliefs and Opinions". In {{this work}} Saadia treats the questions that interested the Mutakallamin, such as the creation of matter, the unity of God, the divine attributes, the soul, etc. Saadia criticizes other philosophers severely. For Saadia <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> as to creation: God created the world ex nihilo, just as the Bible attests; and he contests {{the theory of the}} Mutakallamin in reference to atoms, which theory, he declares, is just as contrary to reason and religion as the theory of the philosophers professing the eternity of matter.|$|E
2500|$|Based on {{the success}} of the 2004 Casualty@Holby City Christmas special, another {{crossover}} was ordered for Christmas 2005. Rather than dividing the episodes between the two series' crews as had previously been standard, this crossover operated as an entirely separate production, with Diana Kyle producing and Paul Harrison directing. A large proportion of the crossover was filmed in a road tunnel in Caernarfon, Wales. Watson commented: [...] "It {{was the only one that}} we could hire for two weeks without causing huge traffic jams. The whole shoot was five weeks long. Staging stunts like car accidents is difficult and stressful at the best of times, but doing all that in a tunnel doubled it. The great advantage was that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> with the weather, it was a totally controlled environment with excellent parking facilities for the unit, and a warm welcome from the locals, which is always nice." ...|$|E
