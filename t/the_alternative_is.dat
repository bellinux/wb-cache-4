5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly inelastic (Ed = 0), changes in the price do not affect the quantity demanded for the good; raising prices will always cause total revenue to increase. Goods necessary to survival can be classified here; a rational person {{will be willing to}} pay anything for a good if <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> death. For example, a person in the desert weak and dying of thirst would easily give all the money in his wallet, no matter how much, for a bottle of water if he would otherwise die. His demand is not contingent on the price.|$|E
25|$|As {{we try to}} find {{evidence}} of his clairvoyance, {{for the time being}} the null hypothesis is that the person is not clairvoyant. <b>The</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>is,</b> of course: the person is (more or less) clairvoyant.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> the {{practice}} note version (introduced {{to the market}} in November 2012). It is a similar traffic light signal format as the other RICS survey products such as the RICS condition report and the RICS homebuyer reports.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> formal {{software}} verification, {{which uses}} mathematical proof techniques {{to show the}} absence of bugs. Researchers at NICTA and its spinout Open Kernel Labs have recently performed such a formal verification of , {{a member of the}} L4 microkernel family, proving functional correctness of the C implementation of the kernel.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{deriving}} a complete welfare ordering from a choice function. Under the sequential solution, <b>the</b> best <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> chosen from <b>the</b> universal set; the second best is the one chosen when <b>the</b> best <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> removed; and so on. We show {{that this is the}} only completion of Bernheim and Rangel's (2009) welfare relation that satisfies two natural axioms: neutrality, which ensures that the names of <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> <b>are</b> welfare-irrelevant; and persistence, which stipulates that every choice function between two welfare-identical choice functions must exhibit the same welfare ordering...|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> {{the wheel}} landing. This {{requires}} the pilot {{to land the}} aircraft on the main wheels while maintaining the tailwheel {{in the air with}} elevator to keep the angle of attack low. Once the aircraft has slowed to a speed that can ensure control will not be lost, but above the speed at which rudder effectiveness is lost, then the tailwheel is lowered to the ground.|$|E
25|$|Enbridge {{has applied}} to reverse its line from Westover to Montreal, Quebec. This line {{used to take}} {{offshore}} oil to refineries in southern Ontario. After reversal, it will take Alberta SCO and bitumen to Montreal. Since Suncor Energy owns a very large oil sands mine and upgrader in Alberta and also owns a large oil refinery in Montreal, it finds this project appealing. <b>The</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> closing the refinery since it is noncompetitive using offshore oil.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> {{to donate}} the primary demand valve that the donor is {{currently}} breathing from, {{on the principle}} that it is known to be working and is immediately recognizable and accessible. The donor, who should be less stressed, will then switch to the secondary demand valve, which in this arrangement is generally mounted on a loop of bungee cord which hangs on the neck, and keeps the secondary demand valve tucked up under the diver's chin, where it can often be reached without the use of the hands, by bending the head forward and gripping the mouthpiece with the teeth.|$|E
40|$|In {{organic farming}} {{there is an}} ongoing {{discussion}} on piglet castration without anaesthesia and possible alternatives to this practice due to animal welfare concerns. Consumer acceptance of alternatives to piglet castration without anaesthesia {{plays an important role}} in this discussion. This contribution examines organic consumers’ attitudes towards piglet castration without anaesthesia and <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> castration with anaesthesia and analgesia, immunocastration and fattening of entire males. Additionally, consumers’ willingness-to-pay for <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> <b>is</b> determined. <b>The</b> results show that animal welfare, food safety and health concerns influence consumers’ attitudes towards <b>the</b> <b>alternatives.</b> However, <b>the</b> individual perception of those aspects is quite varying. Thus, consumers’ opinions towards <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> <b>are</b> also different. Consumers’ perception of <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> <b>is</b> reflected in their willingness-to-pay. When implementing alternatives to piglet castration without anaesthesia the organic farming sector should address consumers’ concerns in an appropriate way in order to avoid misinformation and insecurity among consumers...|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> {{to extract}} and {{reconstruct}} CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent {{more than two}} or three repeat units appearing in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely de novo identification or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs (overlapping DNA segments that together represent a consensus region of DNA) and direct repeat sequences from published genomes as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.|$|E
25|$|Self-verification motives operate for {{different}} {{dimensions of the}} self-concept and in many different situations. Men and women are equally inclined to display this tendency, {{and it does not}} matter whether the self-views refer to characteristics that are relatively immutable (e.g., intelligence) or changeable (e.g., diligence), or whether the self-views happen to be highly specific (e.g., athletic) or global (e.g., low self-esteem, worthlessness). Furthermore, when people chose negative partners over positive ones, it is not merely in an effort to avoid interacting with positive evaluators (that is, out of a concern that they might disappoint such positive evaluators). Rather, people chose self-verifying, negative partners even when <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> participating in a different experiment. Finally, recent work has shown that people work to verify self-views associated with group memberships. For example, women seek evaluations that confirm their belief that they possess qualities associated with being a woman.|$|E
25|$|Other {{critics have}} {{suggested}} that when people with negative self-views seek unfavorable evaluations, they do so {{as a means of}} avoiding truly negative evaluations or for purposes of self-improvement, with the idea being that this will enable them to obtain positive evaluations down the road. Tests of this idea have failed to support it. For example, just as people with negative self-views choose self-verifying, negative evaluators even when <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> being in another experiment, they choose to be in another experiment rather than interact with someone who evaluates them positively. Also, people with negative self-views are most intimate with spouses who evaluate them negatively, despite the fact that these spouses are relatively unlikely to enable them to improve themselves. Finally, in a study of people's thought processes as they chose interaction partners, people with negative self-views indicated that they chose negative evaluators because such partners seemed likely to confirm their self-views (an epistemic consideration) and interact smoothly with them (a pragmatic consideration); self-improvement was rarely mentioned.|$|E

Weiner criticized the episode's review by Alessandra Stanley of the New York Times, expressing that the publication revealed too much information. [...] He continued: [...] "I'm kind of powerless. It's the bargain you make. I wanted to have press, and {{it was nice to}} get that kind of space with those pictures. <b>The</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> not to share these things with the press any more – but how can you expect journalists to write about the show if you don’t?

500|$|The bridge {{allowed the}} town to spread onto the west bank, whilst the east bank, the Haggerlythe, is {{dominated}} by St Mary's Church and the ruins of Whitby Abbey {{which is owned by}} English Heritage. St Mary's Church is a grade I listed building on the site of a Saxon church. The church's ancient foundation dates from the 12thcentury. Over time it has been extensively altered and enlarged but retains several features including box pews. The East Cliff is quite a distance by road from the church, <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> to climb the 199 steps of the [...] "Church Stairs" [...] or use the footpath called [...] "Caedmon's Trod".

500|$|Section 3(1) {{states that}} [...] "So {{far as it}} is {{possible}} to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights." [...] Accordingly, a court must read any statute passed by parliament so as to uphold Convention rights, where this is possible. It is possibly the section of the act with the widest scope. [...] The Human Rights Act therefore built upon a small number of previously recognised absolute freedoms which could only be expressly subjugated to another aim. This is different from other systems, such as the New Zealand Bill of Rights, that require an interpretation to be [...] "reasonable". As happened in R (Anderson) v Home Secretary, the alternative where such interpretation is not possible <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> a declaration of incompatibility under Section 4.

40|$|Six pigeons {{were trained}} on two- and three-alternative {{concurrent}} schedules in which <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> <b>were</b> signaled by different wavelengths {{of light on}} the main pecking key. The schedules were arranged according to a switching-key procedure in which pecks on a white side key produced a 3 -s blackout and, intermittently, a change in the variable-interval schedule of food programmed on the main (center) key after the blackout. In Part 1, a two-alternative concurrent variable-interval schedule was arranged in which <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> <b>were</b> signaled by 560 nm and 630 nm. Parts 2 and 3 arranged three-alternative concurrent variable-interval schedules with <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> signaled by 560 nm, 600 nm, and 630 nm (Part 2) and 560 nm, 623 nm, and 630 nm (Part 3).
