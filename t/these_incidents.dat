5|$|Additional {{problems}} were discovered when the ride {{opened to the}} public. The WindSeeker at Canada's Wonderland underwent repairs for just over a week when {{it was discovered that}} one of the 32 pairs of seats had been removed for an unstated reason. They were replaced and testing began shortly after. In another case at the same installation, riders were stuck {{at the top of the}} WindSeeker tower for 20 minutes when the swings did not come down. Since <b>these</b> <b>incidents,</b> ride operations are suspended during high winds or heavy rain.|$|E
5|$|In Egypt, {{there were}} large {{communities}} of Coptic Christians, Melkites, Turks, Armenians, and Black Africans—the latter two groups {{had a large}} presence in Upper Egypt. Under the Fatimids, non-Muslims in Egypt generally prospered, {{with the exception of}} Caliph al-Hakim's reign. However, with Shirkuh's ascendancy to the vizier position, a number edicts were enacted against the non-Muslim population. With the advent of the Syrian expeditionary force (consisting of Oghuz Turks and Kurds) into Egypt, waves of maltreatment of minorities occurred, irrespective of religion. <b>These</b> <b>incidents</b> occurred while Shirkuh and Saladin were viziers to the Fatimid caliph.|$|E
5|$|In late October and November 1860, Comanches led by Peta Nocona {{conducted}} numerous {{raids on}} various settlements, {{culminating in the}} brutal killing of a pregnant woman. On hearing of <b>these</b> <b>incidents,</b> Houston sent several 25-man companies to assist Ross. A citizen's posse had tracked the raiders to their winter village along the Pease River. As the village contained at least 500 warriors and many women and children, the posse returned to the settlements to recruit additional fighters. Ross requested help from the U.S. Army at Camp Cooper, which sent 21 troops.|$|E
30|$|First, a {{statistical}} analysis of <b>these</b> <b>incident</b> data was conducted to investigate {{the factors that influence}} the incident duration with the scope to find out what variables are important for the prediction process.

5|$|Less than a {{week after}} the {{trespassing}} incident, four people—three male parachutists (one of whom was a construction worker at the site) and their lookout—were arrested for a BASE jump they conducted on September 30, 2013. They had posted a video of the jump online. As a result of <b>these</b> <b>incidents,</b> the Durst Organization's head of security at One World Trade Center, David Velazquez, resigned on March 28, 2014.|$|E
5|$|<b>These</b> <b>incidents</b> {{appear to}} have {{prompted}} the massive strengthening and expansion of the fortifications in various sites. In some cases, arrangements were also made {{for the creation of}} subterranean passages which led to underground cisterns. Tiryns, Midea and Athens expanded their defences with new cyclopean-style walls. The extension program in Mycenae almost doubled the fortified area of the citadel. To this phase of extension belongs the impressive Lion Gate, the main entrance into the Mycenaean acropolis.|$|E
5|$|After <b>these</b> <b>incidents,</b> the US Congress and NASA {{considered}} {{whether to}} abandon the programme {{out of concern for}} the astronauts' safety, but NASA administrator Daniel Goldin decided to continue. The next flight to Mir, STS-86, carried David Wolf aboard Atlantis. During the orbiter's stay, Titov and Parazynski conducted a spacewalk to affix a cap to the docking module for a future attempt by crew members to seal the leak in Spektrs hull. Wolf spent 119 days aboard Mir with the EO-24 crew and was replaced during STS-89 with Andy Thomas, who carried out the last US expedition on Mir. The EO-25 crew arrived in Soyuz TM-27 in January 1998 before Thomas returned to Earth on the final Shuttle–Mir mission, STS-91.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe flow over a {{flat plate}} at a Reynolds number of 750 is numerically {{investigated}} via fine large-eddy simulation (LES), first at normal (90) {{and then at}} oblique (45) incidence flow direction with a uniform steady inlet. The results are {{in complete agreement with}} the direct numerical simulation (DNS) and experimental data, thereby serving as a validation for the present simulations. For the normal (90) uniform inflow case, coherent vortices are alternately shed from both leading edges of the plate, whereas for the oblique (45) uniform inflow case the vortices shed from {{the two sides of the}} plate interact strongly resulting in a quasi-periodic force response. The normal flat plate is then analysed with an incident gust signal with varying amplitude and time period. For <b>these</b> <b>incident</b> coherent gust cases, a reference test case with variable coherent inlet is first studied and the results are compared to a steady inlet simulation, with a detailed analysis of the flow behaviour and the wake response under the incident gust. Finally, the flat plate response to 16 different gust profiles is studied. A transient drag reconstruction for <b>these</b> <b>incident</b> coherent gust cases is then presented based on a frequency-dependent transfer function and phase spectrum analysis...|$|R

5|$|Coyote {{attacks on}} humans are {{uncommon}} and rarely cause serious injuries, {{due to the}} relatively small size of the coyote, but have been increasingly frequent, especially in California. There have been two confirmed fatal attacks: one on a three-year-old named Kelly Keen in Glendale, California and another on a nineteen-year-old named Taylor Mitchell in Nova Scotia, Canada. In the 30 {{years leading up to}} March 2006, at least 160 attacks occurred in the United States, mostly in the Los Angeles County area. Data from United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Wildlife Services, the California Department of Fish and Game, and other sources show that while 41 attacks occurred during the period of 1988–1997, 48 attacks were verified from 1998 through 2003. The majority of <b>these</b> <b>incidents</b> occurred in Southern California near the suburban-wildland interface.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>these</b> <b>incidents,</b> {{legislative}} elections planned {{before the}} coup {{were held in}} April 1964. They were originally to be held on 23 February, though he dissolved the National Assembly and rescheduled them for 12 April. Upon insistence of the French, M'ba allowed opposition candidates to run, which it claimed was {{the main reason for}} starting the coup in the first place. However, their leaders were barred from participating because of their involvement in the coup, and known anti-Mba organizers were deported to remote parts of the country. In addition, M'ba was known to have bribed voters with banknotes.|$|E
5|$|During the study, various {{accusations of}} foul play by or unsuitability of both {{submarine}} designers were made by Australian politicians and the media. These included claims that the similar left-wing political leanings of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Swedish Social Democratic Party, both in power at the time, {{would lead to a}} pro-Kockums bias, investigations into perceived coaching of IDL/HDW representatives in the questions to be asked at an ALP Caucus briefing session on the project, and public emphasis on security incidents in both Sweden and West Germany. <b>These</b> <b>incidents</b> either lacked supporting evidence or were proven false, and were the result of the Liberal Party attempting to discredit the Labor government, or pro-British politicians and organisations who believed both submarines were inferior to the Vickers Type 2400offering.|$|E
30|$|When the ions are {{implanted}} {{into the}} nanomaterials, the ions will collide with the target atoms and charges. As noted previously, the collision processes include three different modes: nuclear collision, electron collision, and charge exchange. Incident ions lose the energy during every collision process {{and may be}} stopped within the materials as impurity atoms. It is common that most of <b>these</b> <b>incident</b> ions stay at the interstitial sites, and these interstitial impurities may migrate to substitutional positions after annealing. This substitutional doping enables the nanomaterials to get more admirable properties.|$|R

5|$|In circa 1250 BC, {{the first}} wave of {{destruction}} has been witnessed in various centers of mainland Greece for reasons that cannot be identified by archaeologists. <b>These</b> <b>incidents</b> appear to have triggered the massive strengthening and expansion of the fortifications in various sites. In some cases, arrangements were also made for the creation of subterranean passages which led to underground cisterns. Nevertheless, none of these measures appear to have prevented the final destruction of the Mycenaean palace centers in the 12th century BC. The reasons that lead to the collapse of the Mycenaean culture have been hotly debated among scholars. The two most common theories are population movement and internal conflict.|$|E
5|$|Oda (or Odo; died 958), {{called the}} Good or the Severe, was a 10th-century Archbishop of Canterbury in England. The {{son of a}} Danish invader, Oda became Bishop of Ramsbury before 928. A number of stories were told about his actions both prior to {{becoming}} and while a bishop, but few of <b>these</b> <b>incidents</b> are recorded in contemporary accounts. After being named to Canterbury in 941, Oda was instrumental in crafting royal legislation as well as involved in providing rules for his clergy. Oda was also involved in the efforts to reform religious life in England. He died in 958 and legendary tales afterwards were ascribed to him. Later he came {{to be regarded as}} a saint, and a hagiography was written in the late 11th or early 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few years the {{situation}} deteriorated further. Governor Tryon and the Boys exchanged threats, truce offers, and other writings, which were frequently written by Allen in florid and didactic language, while the Boys continued to drive surveyors and incoming tenants on New York-granted lands away. Most of <b>these</b> <b>incidents</b> did not involve bloodshed, although individuals were at times manhandled, and the Boys sometimes did extensive property damage when driving tenants out. By March 1774, the harsh treatment of settlers and their property by Allen and the Boys prompted Tryon to increase some of the rewards to £100.|$|E

5|$|Spokane and the Spokane Police Department (SPD) have {{received}} national publicity and scrutiny in the 2000s and 2010s due to many officer-involved shootings and allegations of excessive force. The most high-profile of <b>these</b> <b>incidents</b> was the 2006 death of Otto Zehm, a mentally challenged {{man who was}} initially suspected of theft at a convenience store. Zehm was later found to have committed no crime, but was struck with batons by several officers and tasered. The increased pressure on the SPD prompted an independent review by a commission of the organization's use-of-force policies, an internal culture audit, and the purchase of body cameras.|$|E
5|$|The {{legal issues}} of Burger King include several legal {{disputes}} and lawsuits involving the international fast food restaurant chain Burger King (BK) as both plaintiff and defendant {{in the years}} since its founding in 1954. These have involved almost every aspect of the company's operations. Depending on the ownership and executive staff at the time of <b>these</b> <b>incidents,</b> the company's responses to these challenges have ranged from a conciliatory dialog with its critics and litigants to a more aggressive opposition with questionable tactics and negative consequences. The company's response to these various issues has drawn praise, scorn, and accusations of political appeasement from different parties over the years.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only were}} the {{advisers}} in danger from the enemy, {{but also from the}} men they commanded or advised. On 20 July 1919, like a number of other advisers subsequently, Brown was murdered by his men when they mutinied and went over to the Bolsheviks. While Brown was the only Australian to be killed, there was at least one other major mutiny among the White forces during this period, and several other Australians had narrow escapes. With <b>these</b> <b>incidents</b> becoming increasingly common, and with the ineffectiveness of such a small force in influencing the outcome of the civil war, in March 1919 {{the decision was made to}} withdraw the force. As all faith had been lost in the reliability of locally raised units, this could only be safely completed with the provision of a covering force, and until this could be raised the NREF was condemned to endure the harsh Russian winter.|$|E
