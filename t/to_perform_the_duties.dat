As he set aside unusual coins brought in as bullion, he started the Mint's coin cabinet, which evolved into the National Numismatic Collection. Even after his 1839 retirement, Eckfeldt {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>the</b> <b>duties</b> of chief coiner; his death in 1852 caused his replacement, Franklin Peale, to seek an assistant.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{took part}} in an {{international}} naval demonstration in mid-1886 aimed at preventing a war between Greece and the Ottoman Empire. Lussin joined the ironclad , six torpedo boats, and several wooden vessels for the operation. After Greece refused to demobilize, the international fleet blockaded several Greek ports; Lussin {{and the rest of}} the Austro-Hungarian squadron blockaded Volos in May, and by June, the Greek government had conceded; Lussins period of service in Greek waters lasted from 7 May to 19 June. By 23 June, she had returned to Pola, where she was decommissioned the next day. She was reactivated for service with the training squadron from 8 May to 6 June 1887, but she spent the following year in reserve. Too slow <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>the</b> <b>duties</b> of a fleet scout or a torpedo-boat flotilla leader, Lussin was removed from frontline service in 1890. Lussin was reclassified as a training ship for engine-room personnel in 1889, and for boiler-room personnel the next year.|$|E

25|$|Other ancient civilizations, notably India and China, {{used some}} form of {{adoption}} as well. Evidence suggests {{the goal of this}} practice was to ensure the continuity of cultural and religious practices; in contrast to the Western idea of extending family lines. In ancient India, secondary sonship, clearly denounced by the Rigveda, continued, in a limited and highly ritualistic form, so that an adopter might have the necessary funerary rites performed by a son. China had a similar idea of adoption with males adopted solely <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>the</b> <b>duties</b> of ancestor worship.|$|E

25|$|In early 2001, the Ministry of Defence {{placed an}} order with Vosper Thornycroft (VT) for three River-class {{offshore}} patrol vessels {{to replace the}} Island class. It was understood that the higher availability rates of the River class (up to 300 days per year), would enable the three new ships <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>the</b> <b>duties</b> of the five ships they replaced. The Royal Navy initially chartered (or leased) the ships under a five-year, £60 million contract from the builder VT. As part of the contract, VT {{would be responsible for}} all maintenance and support during the charter period. This contract was renewed in January 2007 for another five years at £52 million. However, in September 2012, instead of renewing the contract again, it was announced by the Defence Secretary Philip Hammond that the Ministry of Defence had purchased the vessels for £39 million.|$|E
25|$|He was {{insulated}} by his wife, who selected {{matters for}} his attention and delegated others to his cabinet. Wilson temporarily resumed a perfunctory attendance at cabinet meetings. By February 1920, the President's true condition was publicly known. At issue was Wilson's fitness {{for the presidency}} {{at a time when}} the League fight was reaching a climax, and domestic issues such as strikes, unemployment, inflation and the threat of Communism were ablaze. No one close to him, including his wife, his physician, or personal assistant, was willing to admit he was unable <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>the</b> <b>duties</b> of the presidency. Because of this complex case, and the subsequent realization of the difficulties that might have been experienced in the nuclear age if, instead of being assassinated in 1963, John F. Kennedy had been left in a permanent vegetative state on account of his brain injuries, the 25th Amendment was ratified in 1967 to allow the voluntary or forcible replacement of an unable or unwilling incumbent.|$|E

500|$|Reagan's {{opponent}} in the 1984 presidential election was former Vice President Walter Mondale. With questions about Reagan's age, and a weak performance in the first presidential debate, his ability <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>the</b> <b>duties</b> of president for another term was questioned. His apparent confused and forgetful behavior was evident to his supporters; they had previously known him clever and witty. Rumors began to circulate that he had Alzheimer's disease. Reagan rebounded in the second debate, and confronted questions about his age, quipping, [...] "I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I {{am not going to}} exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience," [...] which generated applause and laughter, even from Mondale himself.|$|E

As meerkats will not mate with first generation relatives, he eventually left the group and became a roving male. [...] He returned after two episodes and still acted as the group's dominant male as of the end of series three. At the start of the fourth series, Zaphod was shown with his own radio collar. He left the Whiskers again to become a rover, then took over as dominant male of the Aztecs in the second episode of the series. As Maybelline was also one of his daughters, Zaphod was still without a mate. On 4 March 2011, Zaphod died of old age. He was 12 years old.|$|E
500|$|He {{noted that}} Lord Hoffmann in Hall v Simons (2001) {{had said that}} a witness owed no duty of care in respect of his evidence, only a duty to tell the truth, but he {{considered}} that to be incorrect, since it failed to distinguish between witnesses of fact and experts. The expert would have {{a contract with the}} client in which he agreed <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>the</b> <b>duties</b> that he owed to the court, and so there was no conflict between the two duties. In this respect, expert witnesses were more like advocates, who owed duties to client and court, than to witnesses of fact. He noted that barristers had long been immune from negligence claims until the decision of the House of Lords in Hall v Simons. Removing their immunity, he said, had not led to any diminution in advocates performing their duty to the court, and it would be [...] "mere conjecture" [...] to assume that this would be any different for expert witnesses. Neither had vexatious claims been a problem for barristers – in any event, the present case was not vexatious and there were other hurdles, both procedural and financial, in the way of an unsuccessful litigant making unmeritorious claims against an expert. As there was no justification for continuing to hold that expert witnesses were [...] "immune from suit in relation to the evidence they give in court or for the views they express in anticipation of court proceedings", he concluded that the immunity for claims for breach of duty (but not defamation) should be abolished.|$|E
