25|$|Nininger's {{strategy}} was to search for meteorites in the Great Plains of the United States, where the land was largely cultivated and the soil contained few rocks. Between the late 1920s and the 1950s, he traveled across the region, educating local people about what meteorites looked like {{and what to do}} if <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> found one, for example, in the course of clearing a field. The result was the discovery of over 200 new meteorites, mostly stony types.|$|E
25|$|This {{incident}} {{illustrates that}} in the Republic the relationship between Church and State always remained problematic, {{even though it had}} seemed to be settled in favor of the church in 1619. Though the regents knew better than to interfere in matters of doctrine (as they were accused of doing in 1618), <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> certain rights of oversight in return for the privileged status of the Reformed Church. The clergy, on the other hand, had never reconciled itself to such oversight, and on the contrary was of the opinion that the Church had a right to oversee public policy. As the regents would never concede such a right there was a constant tension between the two, not least in the matter of tolerance, or rather, Toleration.|$|E
500|$|In Łódź, Adler triumphantly {{played the}} title role in Karl Gutzkow's Uriel Acosta, {{the first of a}} series of roles through which he {{developed}} a persona he would later call [...] "the Grand Jew". After Łódź, they landed in Zhytomyr, under an incompetent investor/director named Hartenstein. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> found [...] "a quiet corner" [...] of the Russian Empire in which [...] "to make a bit of a livelihood", but in fact Hartenstein was simply running through his money.|$|E

5000|$|Sloths - The Sloths wear coats {{that make}} them slow. But when the coats are removed, the sloths can move fast.

500|$|On October 1, 1845, Barlow {{and three}} men scouted {{ahead of their}} company and entered Mount Hood's foothills from the east near Tygh Creek, about [...] {{from the mouth of}} the Deschutes River. They came within perhaps [...] of Mount Hood. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> glimpsed the Willamette Valley, and learned from the Indians of a trail leading to Oregon City, but {{returned}} to Tygh Creek about five days after their departure. There Joel Palmer was waiting for him with a 23 wagon party. [...] Palmer had followed Barlow for a better route, and had just returned from exploring the same area. [...] The combined company organized road clearing through the forest, mostly by burning.|$|E
500|$|After {{the first}} part of the ballet {{received}} two full orchestral rehearsals in March, Monteux and the company departed to perform in Monte Carlo. Rehearsals resumed when they returned; the unusually large number of rehearsals—seventeen solely orchestral and five with the dancers—were fit into the fortnight before the opening, after Stravinsky's arrival in Paris on 13 May. The music contained so many unusual note combinations that Monteux had to ask the musicians to stop interrupting when <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> found mistakes in the score, saying he would tell them if something was played incorrectly. According to Doris Monteux, [...] "The musicians thought it absolutely crazy". At one point—a climactic brass fortissimo—the orchestra broke into nervous laughter at the sound, causing Stravinsky to intervene angrily.|$|E
500|$|Writers often extolled McCain for {{his courage}} {{not just in}} war but in politics, and wrote sympathetically about him. McCain's shift of {{political}} stances and attitudes during and especially after the 2008 presidential campaign, including his self-repudiation of the maverick label, left many writers expressing sadness and wondering {{what had happened to}} the McCain <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> known. [...] By 2013, some aspects of the older McCain had returned, and his image became that of a kaleidoscope of contradictory tendencies, including, as one writer listed, [...] "the maverick, the former maverick, the curmudgeon, the bridge builder, the war hero bent on transcending the call of self-interest to serve a cause greater than himself, the sore loser, old bull, last lion, loose cannon, happy warrior, elder statesman, lion in winter...." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{distance}} was {{a mile and}} a half, and <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> would <b>have</b> to walk it, but hardly had a dozen rods been covered than they heard the sound of wagon wheels, and a grocery turnout and came into sight driven by a boy Joel Darrel knew well.|$|R
5000|$|... 2005 The French {{explorer}} Thierry Jamin and the French-Peruvian Herbert Cartagena studied Pusharo petroglyphs {{and reported}} to have seen large geoglyphs in a valley nearby. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> might <b>have</b> found a [...] "map" [...] showing where Paititi might be located.

500|$|The {{song was}} also {{added to the}} six song set list of the Hard Candy Promo Tour in 2008. Madonna wore a shiny black outfit with black tails, Adidas track pants and high-heeled, lace-up boots. [...] "Hung Up" [...] was the fourth song of the set list. It was re-invented as a heavy-metal version. As the {{performance}} of [...] "4 Minutes" [...] ended, Madonna picked up an electric guitar and played the first few chords of The Rolling Stones single [...] "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction". She then asked the crowd whether <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> come to a Rolling Stones concert. When the crowd responded negatively, she started [...] "Hung Up", while dedicating it {{to all the people}} who had waited outside in the queue to watch the show. She declared that the noisy, metallic guitar breakdown of the song symbolised what waiting sounded like in the brain of all those who had waited. The song was performed in the futuristic rave with Japanese influences segment of the 2008 Sticky & Sweet Tour. Madonna wore a futuristic robotic outfit designed by Heatherette, with plates on her shoulder and a wig with long curled hair. The similar heavy-metal version of [...] "Hung Up" [...] was performed but it later gave way to the ABBA music. Before starting the performance, she played a capella versions of her older hit songs on audience demand, mostly [...] "Express Yourself" [...] and [...] "Like a Virgin". However, after that, the electric guitar was played to make noises, which Madonna dedicated to Republican vice-presidential nominee for the 2008 election, Sarah Palin. She said, [...] "I'd like to express myself to Sarah Palin right now. [...] This is the sound of Sarah Palin thinking. [...] Sarah Palin can't come to my party. Sarah Palin can't come to my show. It's nothing personal." [...] The performance ended with Madonna playing the guitar riff of [...] "A New Level" [...] by heavy-metal band Pantera. For the second European leg of the tour in 2009, [...] "Hung Up" [...] was removed from the setlist and was replaced by an up-beat version of [...] "Frozen".|$|E
2500|$|Snow Patrol's primary aim for {{a fourth}} album {{was to create a}} better one than the previous, Final Straw. They felt the need to become better players of their {{respective}} instruments as <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> [...] "barely [...] away" [...] with the success of the last album. Subsequently, keyboardist Tom Simpson and drummer Jonny Quinn took classical piano and drum lessons respectively, during the recording of the album.|$|E
2500|$|The {{participant}} was asked {{at the end}} of those [...] "decide trials" [...] in which they had actually pressed the go-button whether they had acted impulsively (without enough time to register the decide signal before enacting their intent to press the go-button in response to the initial go-signal stimulus), or had acted based upon a conscious decision made after seeing the decide signal. Based upon the response time data however, it appears there was discrepancy between when the user thought they had had the opportunity to decide (and had therefore not acted on their impulses) – in this case deciding to press the go-button, and when <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> acted impulsively (based upon the initial go-signal) – where the decide signal came too late to be obeyed.|$|E
60|$|The {{investigation}} justified Philip's {{predictions of}} its uselessness. Nothing was detected but rats, and vaults, and cobwebs; it was cold, earthy, and damp; and when <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> must <b>have</b> penetrated {{far beyond the}} precincts of the keep, they heard Humfrey's voice close to them, warning them that it was nearly dinner-time.|$|R

50|$|Parker and Stone felt that, in hindsight, {{this episode}} {{should have been}} a two-part storyline. <b>They</b> said <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> could <b>have</b> gotten a lot of mileage out of the main premise, with Parker even saying it could have {{potentially}} been a film.

25|$|On 27 March 1871 {{the first}} ever {{international}} match took place, involving the English rugby team and the Scottish. Scotland won the match, which was played at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh.

60|$|Herbert {{felt very}} embarrassed.

50|$|With {{a budget}} of 22 million SEK, The Journey to Melonia was the then most {{expensive}} Swedish animated film ever made, much because of the long production process from 1982 to 1989. When making the script, Per Åhlin and Karl Rasmussen would pick lines from The Tempest <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> might <b>have</b> use of, and then put them together into a coherent synopsis. An influence for the visual style was Jules Verne's Propeller Island from 1895.|$|R
