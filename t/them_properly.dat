5|$|In 1931, Prince Nicholas eloped with Ioana Doletti, a {{divorced}} woman. Marie strongly disapproved of her son's actions and felt hurt by Doletti's repeated attempts to keep Nicholas from communicating with his mother. Although she blamed {{the women in}} her sons' lives for a while, she also came to blame herself, for failing to educate <b>them</b> <b>properly.</b> However, she stubbornly and continually refused to meet Magda Lupescu, even after Carol's pleas. Until her last years, Marie seldom even mentioned Lupescu's name.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{smell of}} burning {{was present in}} the Lords' {{chambers}} during the afternoon of 16 October, and at 4:00pm two gentlemen tourists visiting to see the Armada tapestries that hung there were unable to view <b>them</b> <b>properly</b> because of the thick smoke. As they approached Black Rod's box {{in the corner of}} the room, they felt heat from the floor coming through their boots. Shortly after 4:00pm Cross and Furlong finished work, put the last few sticks into the furnaces—closing the doors as they did so—and left to go to the nearby Star and Garter public house.|$|E

On the {{recommendation}} of TommyD, the band had been recording sample tracks onto a DPS12 hard disk recorder in their tour bus while on an American tour and they returned to Monnow Valley to record <b>them</b> <b>properly.</b> The band felt less pressure on them for the new album, due to {{the success of}} International Velvet and because they no longer feared being dropped by the label.|$|E
5|$|It was {{difficult}} for the few priests who had accompanied the Christian emigrants to South Canara to look after <b>them</b> <b>properly.</b> Thus, the Gurkar system came into existence. Gurkars were Mangalorean Catholic men of good moral character who were selected as headmen in Christian settlements. They were entrusted with the social and religious supervision of the community. After migration, the only possible occupation of a Mangalorean Catholic was agriculture, since they were skilled farmers. Every farmer practised carpentry, but it was quite primitive and unskilled, and other crafts and industries were non-existent. The mass was celebrated in Latin; but the sermon, the catechism, and the explication of the mysteries were delivered to the congregation in Konkani.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} of the {{gameplay}} is its focus on guns over swords and magic. When deciding upon the game's basics, the team {{wanted to create a}} cinematic feeling in battles. If they had gone with a more traditional battle system, then it would have quickly lost its cinematic quality due to the prevalence of close combat. Likewise, they wanted the cinematic feel to persist throughout the whole game rather than restricted to cutscenes. A major challenge was {{to strike a balance between}} accessibility and difficulty when developing for a player base that might be made of up of both action game and RPG players. This resulted in the addition of strategy elements. Another wish was to create something new and fresh in the RPG market. When creating the gameplay style, the team looked at action movies such as The Matrix and Rebellion during their research. Despite its fast-paced action, the game relies heavily upon strategic, turn-based gameplay. During early development, the game was based on a real-time system and meant for only one character to be controlled by the player; the other two would have been handled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). After some testing, they decided that this would create unwanted difficulties in gameplay such as characters dying off-screen without the player noticing or the AI not directing <b>them</b> <b>properly.</b>|$|E

25|$|Psychological {{assessment}} is a psychological evaluation process used by clinicians, {{in order to}} help <b>them</b> <b>properly</b> produce a hypothesis from the collected patient information. The Child PTSD Symptom Scale is a self-report assessment that clinicians use to diagnose PTSD symptoms and their severity in children ages 8–18. However, PTSD can be diagnosed much earlier than 8 years of age, and sometimes the victim fears who report their traumatic experiences. Therefore, other measures, such as teacher and caregiver assessments, must be conducted.|$|E

Popular models of organizational learning (such as Dixon 1994) assume such a link. It is, therefore, imperative 'that the link between {{individual and}} collective learning and the organization's strategic objectives is made'. This shortcoming, Finger and Brand argue, makes a case for some form of measurement of organizational learning – so that it is possible to assess the extent to which such learning contributes or not towards strategic objectives.|$|E

25|$|The dashboard's design {{originated}} {{from a large}} number of complaints from customers that the previous Taurus' radio and climate control modules were cluttered with many small and similar feeling buttons, as well as small graphics, which caused the driver to have to look away from the road to be able to operate <b>them</b> <b>properly.</b> As a result, {{a large portion of the}} third generation's dash was devoted to the radio and climate control, with each button on these modules containing a unique design, making it easier for the driver to operate the radio and climate control without taking their eyes off the road. This would eventually lead to the creation of the Integrated Control Panel.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, {{as part of}} the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, during Operation Ring, Soviet {{troops and}} the {{predominantly}} Azerbaijani soldiers in the AzSSR OMON and army forcibly uprooted Armenians living in the 24 villages strewn across Shahumyan to leave their homes and settle elsewhere in Nagorno-Karabakh or in the neighboring Armenian SSR. Human rights organizations documented a wide number of human rights violations and abuses committed by Soviet and Azerbaijani forces and many of <b>them</b> <b>properly</b> characterised them as ethnic cleansing. These violations and abuses included forced deportations of civilians, unlawful killings, torture, kidnapping harassment, rape and the wanton seizure or destruction of property. Despite fierce protests, no measures were taken either to prevent the human rights abuses or to punish the perpetrators. Approximately 17,000 Armenians living in twenty-three of Shahumyan's villages were deported out of the region.|$|E

25|$|The {{band members}} were modeled using motion {{capturing}} performed by actors hired by Harmonix, incorporating video and concert footage to create avatars for each member unique to each venues. The band's support team helped to take {{photographs of the}} band member's tattoos, and identified when they were received so that the Harmonix artists could incorporate <b>them</b> <b>properly</b> into the avatars. All the songs, including the six Green Day songs previously released as downloadable content, feature unique animations tied to each song. This was a different approach than as taken for The Beatles: Rock Band, where they created snippets of framing and animation which could be easily repackaged for other songs, including future downloadable content. Because of the integrated nature of the songs and animations, {{there will be no}} further downloadable content available for the game. The game includes, as reward items, over 100 photographs and 40 minutes of video footage pulled from Warner Bros. Records' archive of the band. The video content has been pared down from over 20 hours of raw footage from concerts and studio records. Some of the live video footage will be used as part of the 21st Century Breakdown venue backdrops. Many of these rewards are specific to individual songs, such as photos taken during concert performances of the song, and thus given as rewards for completing these songs.|$|E

The castles were much larger than {{they needed to be}} in order to protect against Welsh attack, but the sheer scale of them meant that the Crown could not afford to maintain or garrison <b>them</b> <b>properly.</b> The fortifications were in some regards simply too big, and as historian Michael Prestwich notes, smaller projects might actually have been more effective. Rather than the sites being scientifically designed, historian Richard Morris suggested that [...] "the impression is firmly given of an elite group of men-of-war, long-standing comrades in arms of the king, indulging in an orgy of military architectural expression on an almost unlimited budget".|$|E

Abdulmutallab was handcuffed while the pilot safely landed the plane. In all, three people were injured: Abdulmutallab, Schuringa, and one other passenger. Upon landing in Detroit, Abdulmutallab was arrested and taken to a hospital for treatment of his burns. On December28, 2009, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) claimed responsibility for the attempted bombing.
