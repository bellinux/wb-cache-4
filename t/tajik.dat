5|$|The Hebrew {{alphabet}} is, {{like the}} Persian alphabet, an abjad. It {{is used for}} the Jewish Bukhori dialect primarily in Samarkand and Bukhara. Additionally, since 1940, when Jewish schools were closed in Central Asia, the use of the Hebrew Alphabet outside Hebrew liturgy fell into disuse and Bukharian Jewish publications such as books and newspapers began to appear using the <b>Tajik</b> Cyrillic Alphabet. Today, many older Bukharian Jews who speak Bukharian and went to <b>Tajik</b> or Russian schools in Central Asia only know the <b>Tajik</b> Cyrillic Alphabet when reading and writing Bukharian and <b>Tajik.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Decree on Romanisation {{made this}} law in April, 1928. The Latin variant for <b>Tajik</b> {{was based on}} the work by Turcophone {{scholars}} who aimed to produce a unified Turkic alphabet, despite <b>Tajik</b> not being a Turkic language. The literacy campaign was successful, with near-universal literacy being achieved by the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Tajiks</b> are the {{principal}} ethnic group in most of Tajikistan, {{as well as in}} northern and western Afghanistan, though there are more <b>Tajiks</b> in Afghanistan than in Tajikistan. <b>Tajiks</b> are a substantial minority in Uzbekistan, as well as in overseas communities.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{influence}} of Islam in the region, <b>Tajik</b> was written in the Persian alphabet up to the 1920s. Until this time, the language was not thought of as separate and simply considered a dialect of the Persian language. The Soviets began by simplifying the Persian alphabet in 1923, before moving to a Latin-based system in 1927. The Latin script was introduced by the Soviet Union {{as part of an effort}} to increase literacy and distance the, at that time, largely illiterate population, from the Islamic Central Asia. There were also practical considerations. The regular Persian alphabet, being an abjad, does not provide sufficient letters for representing the vowel system of <b>Tajik.</b> In addition, the abjad is more difficult to learn, each letter having different forms depending on the position in the word.|$|E
5|$|The Cyrillic {{script was}} {{introduced}} in <b>Tajik</b> Soviet Socialist Republic in the late 1930s, replacing the Latin script {{that had been used}} since the October Revolution. After 1939, materials published in Persian in the Persian alphabet were banned from the country. The alphabet below was supplemented by the letters Щ and Ы in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Karmal {{was born}} Sultan Hussein on 6 January 1929, {{was the son}} of Muhammad Hussein Hashem, a Major General in the Afghan Army and former {{governor}} of the province of Paktia, and was the second of five siblings. His family was one of the wealthier families in Kabul. His ethnic background is disputed, some claim that he was <b>Tajik</b> who represented himself as a Ghilzai Pashtun but others claim that he descended from Hindu ancestors of Kashmir. In 1986, Karmal announced that he, and his brother Mahmud Baryalay, were Pashtun because their mother came from the Mullakhel branch of the Pashtuns. However, this was controversial, considering that lineage in Afghanistan is supposed to be traced through the father, not the mother. The accusation that he was of Indian Muslim ancestry {{comes from the fact that}} his birthname, Sultan Hussein, is a common Indian Muslim name. In addition, Karmal's own father denied his own ethnicity; Karmal's father was a <b>Tajik.</b> To further confuse the matter, Karmal spoke Dari (Persian) and not Pashto.|$|E

5|$|The Yaghnobi {{people living}} in the Sughd {{province}} of Tajikistan still speak a dialect of the Sogdian language. Yaghnobi is largely a continuation of the medieval Sogdian dialect from the Osrushana region of the western Fergana Valley. The great majority of the Sogdian people assimilated with other local groups such as the Bactrians, Chorasmians, and in particular with Persians and came to speak Persian. In 819 the Persians founded the Samanid Empire in the region. They are among the ancestors of the modern Tajiks. Numerous Sogdian cognates {{can be found in the}} modern <b>Tajik</b> language, although the latter is a Western Iranian language.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tajiks</b> {{comprise}} around 79.9% of {{the population}} of Tajikistan. This number includes speakers of the Pamiri languages, including Wakhi and Shughni, and the Yaghnobi people who in the past were considered by the government of the Soviet Union nationalities separate from the <b>Tajiks.</b> In the 1926 and 1937 Soviet censuses, the Yaghnobis and Pamiri language speakers were counted as separate nationalities. After 1937, these groups were required to register as <b>Tajiks.</b>|$|R

However, until the middle of the 19th century, Namangan still had a <b>Tajik</b> majority. Today, the city is an Uzbek speaking city, albeit with a large Persian speaking <b>Tajik</b> minority.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Tajiks</b> of Xinjiang practiced slavery, selling some {{of their}} own as a punishment.
