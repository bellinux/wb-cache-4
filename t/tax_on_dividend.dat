A stock pricing sample is developed and evaluated for a period prior to announcement of the 1983 tax reform until the end of November 1983.

40|$|The United States {{imposes a}} 30 percent {{withholding}} tax on dividends paid to nonresident aliens. However, this tax is rarely paid by portfolio investors {{because they can}} swap into U. S. securities, receiving payments to match both capital gain and dividends. Treasury has ruled that swap payments have an origin in the taxpayer’s residence {{so there is no}} withholding obligation on payments that match dividends. The proposal would impose withholding <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>dividend</b> equivalents on the ground that there is no policy justification for a distinction between dividends, substitute dividends under securities lending transaction (which are treated as dividends and are subject to withholding), and dividend equivalents paid under swaps. The proposal is made {{as a part of the}} Shelf Project, a collaboration of tax professionals to develop and perfect proposals to strengthen the tax base. Shelf Project proposals are intended to raise revenue without raising rates — the best systems have the lowest feasible tax rates because the taxes are unavoidable.

40|$|T he U.

Until 2003, individuals were <b>taxed</b> <b>on</b> <b>dividend</b> income {{at the same}} rates as on other forms of income, resulting in overall <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>dividends</b> much higher than those in most other countries (PriceWaterhouse-Coopers, 2003 a, b).

Many economists have long opposed the double taxation of dividends because of the high overall tax rates this imposed on corporate income. They argued that double taxation deterred corporate investment and distorted corporate financing decisions, favoring debt over equity financing and earnings retention over dividend payouts. More recently, financial economists stressed how higher dividends (and consequently reduced retained earnings) can improve corporate governance by discouraging empire-building financed by retained earnings...|$|R
