5|$|By 1675 <b>the</b> <b>Swedish</b> fleet was numerically {{superior}} to its Danish counterpart (18 ships of the line against 16, 21 frigates against 11), but <b>the</b> <b>Swedish</b> ships were generally older and of poorer quality than the Danish, which had replaced {{a larger proportion of}} its vessels with more modern warships. <b>The</b> <b>Swedish</b> side also had problems with routine maintenance, and both rigging and sails were generally in poor condition. Swedish crews lacked the level of professionalism of Danish and Norwegian sailors, who often had experience from service in the Dutch merchant navy, and <b>the</b> <b>Swedish</b> Navy lacked a core of professional officers while the Danish had seasoned veterans like Cort Adeler and Nils Juel. The Danish fleet was reinforced with Dutch units under Philip van Almonde and Cornelis Tromp, the latter an experienced officer who had served under Michiel de Ruyter.|$|E
