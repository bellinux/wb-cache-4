He refused many offers to appear in films, including title roles in The Thomas Crown Affair and Gene Wilder's role in Blazing Saddles.

Several units of police were <b>then</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> charge the squat, some of them armed with submachine guns. About 1500 police had been drafted in for the assault.

500|$|LaFace Records {{commissioned}} a music video {{to be directed}} by Bille Woodruff. The concept evolves around the ending of Braxton's relationship with her lover, played by model Tyson Beckford. As the video begins, Beckford is seen leaving their home, with Braxton giving him a goodbye kiss, <b>then</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> check the mailbox. After he leaves the garage, a fast car suddenly appears and causes an accident, leaving him lying on the street while Braxton cries over his body. She then walks around the house, remembering the good moments she had with him, such as swimming in the pool and playing Twister. During the bridge and final chorus, Braxton is seen singing the song during a live concert, an allusion to the film [...] "A Star is Born". As applause rises, the video fades to black. The music video premiered on September 10, 1996 on MTV.|$|E
500|$|Although {{he was a}} striker, Dickov {{was better}} known for his {{tenacity}} than his goal-scoring exploits. In a 2003 interview with the Independent on Sunday he provided a summary of his playing style: [...] "The ability to battle {{is one of the}} main parts of my game. I know my limits. I am not the sort who gets the ball and is <b>then</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> beat five or six players and stick it in the top corner from God knows where. But, whether I'm playing well or not, the one thing you will get from me is 110 per cent, upsetting defenders and basically giving them pain." [...] Rio Ferdinand was mentioning his name as the biggest headache to deal with on the pitch. His combative approach resulted in Manchester City manager Joe Royle naming him [...] "The Wasp", and during his time at Leicester he was known as [...] "The Pest".|$|E
500|$|Björk was {{intending}} to have several producers {{work on the}} album, but this idea never came to fruition. Björk was <b>then</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the album produced with Paul Fox until she was introduced to producer Nellee Hooper by her boyfriend Dominic Thrupp. Hooper had previously produced albums by Soul II Soul, Sinéad O'Connor and Massive Attack, which made Björk skeptical about working with him, stating that [...] "I thought Nellee was too 'good taste' for my liking. But then I met him, got to know him, [...] got to hear about his fabulous ideas..." [...] Björk and Hooper's recording ideas were very similar, {{which led to the}} decision to end production work with Massey and Fox. Hooper introduced Björk to studio technology and studio programmer Marius de Vries who gave Debut a modern style with the use of keyboards and synthesizers. Hooper produced the first ten tracks on the album, while Björk co-produced [...] "Like Someone in Love" [...] with Hooper and produced [...] "The Anchor Song" [...] solely herself. Björk and Hooper spent many sessions in the studio working on Debut until the album was finished in early 1993.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, she spoke the {{required}} words of repentance for political abuse of psychiatry which had had unprecedented dimensions in the Soviet Union for discrediting, intimidation and {{suppression of the}} human rights movement carried out primarily in this institution. Her words were widely broadcast abroad but were published only in the St. Petersburg newspaper Chas Pik within the country. However, in her 2001 book Aliyans Prava i Milosediya (The Alliance of Law and Mercy), Dmitrieva wrote that there were no psychiatric abuses and certainly no more than in Western countries. Moreover, the book makes the charge that professor Vladimir Serbsky and other intellectuals were wrong not to cooperate with the police department in preventing revolution and bloodsheds and that the current generation is wrong to oppose the regime. In 2007, Dmitrieva asserted that the practice of [...] "punitive psychiatry" [...] had been grossly exaggerated, while nothing wrong had been done by the Serbsky Institute. After that an official at the Serbsky Institute declared [...] "patient" [...] Vladimir Bukovsky, who was <b>then</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> run for the President of the Russian Federation, undoubtedly [...] "psychopathic".|$|E

At {{the start of}} the series he believes alien interference to be a result of hallucinations induced by psychotropic drugs in the water supply and that his girlfriend's job is nothing more unusual than generic [...] "special ops". Writer Stephen James Walker feels that Rhys [...] "originally didn't look to have much to him initially but really came into his own as Series One progressed", attributing this to the [...] "spot-on performance of the perfectly cast Kai Owen." [...] The original intention of the writers had been for Rhys to die at the end of series one, but Richard Stokes explains that it was overruled by show creator Russell T Davies, who felt that without Rhys, the show's main link to the real world would be lost. Executive Producer Julie Gardner expands on this by stating that [...] "It's a show where you've got to contrast the ordinary everyday with the extraordinary and (with) Gwen going home to Rhys and <b>then</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> work in an underground secret base... it's right to have that balance." [...] Actor Kai Owen attributes part of his character's success to his on-screen rapport with actress Eve Myles.|$|E

[...] "My homeland exists only in my soul", he once said. He continued painting Jewish motifs and subjects from his memories of Vitebsk, although he included Parisian scenes—- the Eiffel Tower in particular, along with portraits. Many of his works were updated versions of paintings he had made in Russia, transposed into Fauvist or Cubist keys.|$|E

2500|$|Originally, {{this record}} was {{intended}} to be a double album, but Atlantic Records didn’t like the idea, so it was trimmed down to 17 songs. The album was <b>then</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have spoken tracks in-between all the songs but that was scrapped also. The final version scrapped the 17th song [...] "Larry Elbows" [...] and erased all the spoken tracks except for the intro to Jesus Saves. The cover had the story explained in it {{to make up for the}} lost spoken tracks. Atlantic somehow over the years managed to lose the master tapes to Streets so the left over songs truly are lost. Many of the riffs from these songs showed up on the next album Edge of Thorns. Another interesting detail about the album is that [...] "Jesus Saves" [...] was originally written as a midtempo song, not the rocker it became on the finished album. In 2013, some of the lost material was found and the album was re-issued with the title: Streets: A Rock Opera - Narrated Version.|$|E
2500|$|On September 23, 1862, Katamori was {{formally}} summoned to Edo Castle and {{presented with the}} assignment. The position was not without its personal incentives: it included an office salary of 50,000 koku a year, a 30,000 ryō loan to cover the expense of traveling to Kyoto, {{as well as a}} promotion to senior 4th court rank, lower grade ( [...] ; shō-shi'i-ge). Following the assignment, a sweeping program of personnel reassignment took place in the Tokugawa government's Kyoto command structure. Assigned together with Katamori were a group of trusted, powerful daimyō and hatamoto: Nagai Naoyuki was named Kyoto City Magistrate, Makino Tadayuki, the lord of the Nagaoka domain, was made Kyoto Shoshidai, and Chūjō Nobunori as Katamori's assistant for protocol. Katamori then sent a group of seven men under the previously mentioned Tanaka Tosa ahead to Kyoto, in order to begin forming the necessary connections with domains already in Kyoto, as well as the Imperial court. After a few months of further political difficulty, he left Edo on January 27, 1863 {{at the head of a}} thousand-strong Aizu force. Entering Kyoto on February 11, he first headed to Honzen-ji Temple, changing into court clothes, <b>then</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the residence of Imperial regent Konoe Tadahiro and paying his respects. After that, he promptly set up residence in the eastern section of the city, at Konkaikōmyō-ji Temple, in the Kurotani area. Soon after his arrival, Katamori was again formally received by the Court, appearing before regent Konoe together with his senior retainers Ono Gonnojō and Komori Ikkan. His warm reception and popularity with many in the Court thus set a precedent of frequent visits that was to continue for the duration of his position.|$|E
