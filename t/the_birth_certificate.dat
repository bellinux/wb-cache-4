40|$|To address {{concerns}} regarding the representativeness of controls in case-control studies, two selection strategies were evaluated {{in a study}} of childhood leukemia, which commenced in California in 1995. The authors selected two controls per case: one from among children identified by using computerized birth records and located successfully, the other from a roster of friends; both were matched on demographic factors. Sixty-four birth certificate–friend control pairs were enrolled (n = 128). Additionally, 192 “ideal ” controls were selected without tracing from <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> records. Data on parental ages, parental education, mother’s reproductive history, and birth weight were obtained from <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>certificates</b> of all 320 subjects. For all variables except <b>birth</b> weight, <b>the</b> differences between <b>birth</b> <b>certificate</b> and ideal controls were smaller than those between friend and ideal controls. None of <b>the</b> differences between <b>birth</b> <b>certificate</b> and ideal controls was significant, whereas two factors were significantly different between friend and ideal controls. These findings suggest that friend controls may be less representative than <b>birth</b> <b>certificate</b> controls. Despite difficulty in tracing and a seemingly low participation rate (49. 0 % for 560 enrolled <b>birth</b> <b>certificate</b> controls), using <b>birth</b> records to recruit controls appears to provide a representative sample of children and an opportunity to assess the representativeness of controls. case-control studies; child; epidemiologic methods; leukemi...|$|R
