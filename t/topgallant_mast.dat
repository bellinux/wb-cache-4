25|$|By this time, Luckner had {{the problem}} of feeding and keeping safe nearly 300 prisoners, in {{addition}} to his own crew. Consequently, when on 20 March, the French four-masted barque Cambronne was captured, Luckner arranged for the ship's <b>topgallant</b> <b>mast</b> and additional spars and sails to be removed, before putting his prisoners aboard Cambronne under the command of Captain Mullen of Pinmore. The much-reduced rigging on Cambronne ensured Seeadler would be able to escape before her location could be reported to the hunting ships.|$|E
25|$|Whereas 20th-Century square-rigged vessels were {{constructed}} of steel with steel standing rigging, prior vessels used wood masts with hemp-fiber standing rigging. As rigs became taller {{by the end}} of the 19th Century, masts relied more heavily on successive spars, stepped one atop the other to form the whole, from bottom to top: the lower mast, top mast, and <b>topgallant</b> <b>mast.</b> This construction relied heavily on support by a complex array of stays and shrouds. Each stay in either the fore-and-aft or athwartships direction had a corresponding one in the opposite direction providing counter-tension. Fore-and-aft the system of tensioning started with the stays that were anchored at in front each mast. Shrouds were tensioned by pairs deadeyes, circular blocks that had the large-diameter line run around them, whilst multiple holes allowed smaller line—lanyard—to pass multiple times between the two and thereby allow tensioning of the shroud.|$|E
500|$|Minotaur finally {{commissioned}} in Portsmouth as {{the flagship}} of the Channel Squadron, a position which she retained until 1873. In 1868 the ship nearly rammed the ironclad [...] {{as they were}} leaving Belfast Lough. Minotaur lost her bowsprit and fore <b>topgallant</b> <b>mast,</b> but Bellerophon only suffered some minor flooding. She paid off for a long refit in 1873 and resumed her position in 1875 when she rejoined the Channel Squadron. Minotaur became the first ship in the Royal Navy to receive a permanent installation of an electric searchlight in 1876. The ship was the flagship of Vice Admiral Sir William Hewett, who had earned the Victoria Cross in the Siege of Sevastopol in 1854, during Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee Fleet Review on 23 July 1887. Minotaur was paid off {{at the end of}} 1887 in Portsmouth and assigned to the Reserve until 1893 when she became a training ship at Portland. She was renamed HMS Boscawen II in March 1904 and transferred in 1905 to Harwich as part of the HMS Ganges training school. The ship was renamed 11 June 1906 as HMS Ganges and then to Ganges II on 25 April 1908. She was sold on 30 January 1922 for scrap.|$|E

5000|$|Stag Hound sailed from New York City on February 1, 1851 for San Francisco {{with a crew}} of 46 men. She was {{so heavily}} sparred that, at full sail, she carried almost 6,000 square yards of canvas.

60|$|All {{hands were}} at work, next morning, {{with the first}} gleam of daylight. The rollers were still almost {{as high as the}} day before; but there was now a slight breath of wind, which sufficed to give the vessel {{steerage}} way. She was put head to the rollers, changing the motion from the tremendous rolling, when she was lying broadside to them, for a regular rise and fall that interfered but little with the work. A spare spar was fitted in the place of the bowsprit, the stump of the topmast was sent down, and the <b>topgallant</b> <b>mast</b> fitted in its place and, by midday, the light spars were all in their places again, and the brig was showing a fair spread of canvas; and a casual observer would, at a distance, have noticed but slight change in her appearance.|$|E
60|$|More {{than once}} every flag they hoisted was shot away, {{and at last}} one of the sailors went aloft and nailed the admiral’s colours to the stump of the main <b>topgallant</b> <b>mast.</b> The Vryhide also fought with desperate courage. Other British ships, however, came up, and the {{disparity}} in numbers turned the other way. The Ardent attacked her on the other side, and the Triumph and Director poured a raking fire along her decks. One after another her masts fell, and the wreck rendered half her guns unworkable. Her crew were swept away, until De Winter was left alone on her quarter-deck, while below there were hardly enough men left to man the pumps. Then the gallant admiral with his own hand hauled down his colours, having fought to the admiration of the whole British fleet. The States-general, almost disabled by the fruitless attempt to foul the Venerable, maintained a vigorous conflict for some time against a succession of adversaries, during which she lost above three hundred men killed and wounded, until at last her captain was compelled to strike. No one, however, attempted to take possession of her, and, gradually dropping astern until clear of both fleets, she rehoisted her colours and made off to the Texel.|$|E

5000|$|Later full rigged ships {{split the}} topsail (and often the {{topgallant}} sail) for easier handling. They thus fly two topsails (and possibly two topgallant sails) per mast. The lower topgallant sail is immediately above the upper topsail. The upper or only topgallant sail is set {{from the top}} of the <b>topgallant</b> <b>mast,</b> if there is a lower topgallant it is set from midway down the <b>topgallant</b> <b>mast.</b> A staysail set on a stay running forward and downwards from the top or midpoint of the <b>topgallant</b> <b>mast</b> is called a topgallant staysail.|$|E
50|$|St Helena was {{an early}} example of a schooner-brigantine. Construction cost £21 per ton. Originally, she was {{intended}} to be a topgallant-yard schooner, but later she received a <b>topgallant</b> <b>mast.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} the wind had dropped entirely. The <b>topgallant</b> <b>masts</b> were sent up with their yards and sails, and by dinner-time the Flying Scud looked more like herself. As soon as the wind lulled all on board were {{conscious}} of a sudden fall of temperature. Bundles of wraps were undone and greatcoats and cloaks got out, and although the sun was still shining brightly the poop of the Flying Scud soon presented a wintry appearance. There was no sitting about now. Even the ladies had abandoned their usual work, and by the sharp {{walking up and down}} on deck it was evident that even the warm wraps were insufficient in themselves, and that brisk exercise was necessary to keep up the circulation.|$|R
5000|$|When steel masts were introduced, {{with their}} lengths no longer {{limited by the}} height of a tree, ships were often {{constructed}} with single spars serving as both lower mast and topmast. In every other respect, however, the [...] "topmast" [...] lived on, with separate shrouds to the lower mast and a top between the two. The section of mast immediately above the top was often painted white as the lower masthead used to be, with the section of the steel mast representing the topmast continuing on above in its usual colour. <b>Topgallant</b> <b>masts</b> and royal masts were similarly combined, though, being shorter, they were often one spar even in the days of wood. A common arrangement on tall ships now in use is a steel spar as lower and topmast, surmounted by a wooden <b>mast</b> as <b>topgallant</b> and royal.|$|R
5000|$|Sails are {{referred}} to by their mast and then name, e.g., [...] "the fore <b>mast</b> <b>topgallant</b> sail", often shortened to [...] "fore t'gallant", or historically [...] "fore t'gar'ns'l". Where no mast is specified, the main mast is implied.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to overlapping the mast below, the top mast and <b>topgallant</b> <b>mast</b> were supported laterally by shrouds that connected {{to either a}} platform, called a [...] "top", or cross-wise beams, called [...] "crosstrees", and anchored futtock shrouds from below {{that led to the}} lower mast.|$|E
5000|$|Crosstrees {{are the two}} {{horizontal}} spars at {{the upper}} ends of the topmasts of sailing ships, used to anchor the [...] shrouds from the <b>topgallant</b> <b>mast.</b> Similarly, they may be mounted at {{the upper end of}} the topgallant to anchor the shrouds from the royal mast (if fitted). Similar transverse spars remain on steam ship and motor vessel masts to secure wire antennae or signal flag halyards.|$|E
50|$|On large rigs, staysails {{other than}} {{headsails}} are named {{according to the}} mast and mast section on which they are hoisted. Thus, the staysail hoisted on a stay that runs forward and downwards {{from the top of}} the mizzen <b>topgallant</b> <b>mast</b> is the mizzen topgallant staysail. If two staysails are hoisted to different points on this mast, they would be the mizzen upper topgallant staysail and the mizzen lower topgallant staysail.|$|E
50|$|Eagle has a three-masted barque sailing rig, {{with two}} masts fully rigged with 'square sails' and one mast with only 'fore-and-aft' sails. The large sail {{area of the}} 'square sails' provide much of the power while the 'fore-and-aft' sails enable {{superior}} maneuverability. The ship has over 6 mi of running rigging and approximately 22280 sq ft of sail area. To protect sails from chafing, Eagle uses baggywrinkle extensively. The top three yards of the fore- and main masts are moveable, and are kept lowered when not sailing to lower the ship's center of gravity. In addition, the top portion of the fore- and main masts, known as the <b>topgallant</b> <b>masts,</b> may be housed (lowered) by 13 ft when not under sail in order to sail underneath low bridges. Eagles fastest point of sail is when her yards are braced sharp (or pivoted {{as much as they}} can be) and the relative wind (the wind you feel standing on the ship as it moves) is approximately 5-10 degrees aft of the windward leech of the sail. When fully braced, Eagle can sail about 75 degrees off of the true wind. Eagles propeller shaft can also be de-clutched from the engine so the propeller can freewheel, thus lessening drag while under sail.|$|R
50|$|The staysails {{between the}} masts are named from the sail {{immediately}} below the highest attachment {{point of the}} stay holding up the staysail. Thus, the mizzen topgallant staysail can be found dangling from the stay leading from above the mizzen (third) <b>mast's</b> <b>topgallant</b> sail to some place (usually two sails down) on the second (main) mast.|$|R
6000|$|Towards {{the middle}} of our second week out, we fell in with a storm--a rotatory affair, and soon over by reason that we struck the outer fringe of it; but to a {{landsman}} sufficiently daunting while it lasted. Late in the afternoon I thrust my head up for a look around. We were weltering along in horrible forty-foot seas, over which our bulwarks tilted at times until from the companion hatchway I stared plumb into the grey sliding chasms, and felt like a fly on the wall. The Lady Nepean hurled her old timbers along under close-reefed maintopsail, and a rag of a foresail only. The captain had housed <b>topgallant</b> <b>masts</b> and lashed his guns inboard; yet she rolled so that you would not have trusted a cat on her storm-washed decks. They were desolate but for the captain and helmsman on the poop; the helmsman, a mere lad--the one, in fact, who had pulled the bow-oar to our rescue--lashed and gripping the spokes pluckily, but with a white face which told that, though his eyes were strained on the binnacle, his mind ran on the infernal seas astern. Over him, in sea-boots and oilskins, towered Captain Colenso--rejuvenated, transfigured; his body swaying easily to every lurch and plunge of the brig, his face entirely composed and cheerful, his salt-rimmed eyes contracted a little, but alert and even boyishly bright. An heroical figure of a man! ...|$|R
50|$|The stay of {{the fore}} <b>topgallant</b> <b>mast</b> is {{attached}} to the jib-boom at the extremity of its point. The stay for the jib sail {{is attached to}} the shouldering at its heel. Just as the bowsprit has bobstays, in order to counteract the upward force from the jib and fore topgallant stays a martingale hangs down from the point of the jib-boom to a dolphin striker, pulling downwards on the jib-boom.|$|E

5000|$|The Potosi was steel-built, with a {{waterline}} {{length of}} 110 m {{and a total}} hull length of 122.42 m. The hull was 15.15 m wide and the ship had a displacement of 8,350 tons, for an effective carrying capacity of 6,400 tons. The ship had only one bulkhead in the bow section—the collision bulkhead. The ship had five masts, four of which were fully rigged, with courses, upper and lower topsails, upper and lower topgallant sails, and royals. Counting the staysails (12) including jibs (4), she carried 43 sails (24 square sails in six storeys, 12 (normally 9) staysails between the five masts, four foresails (jibs) and three fore-and-aft spanker sails including two spanker sails on two gaffs and a spanker topsail) with a total sail area of 56510.53 sq ft sq metres. Not only the hull was steel, but also her masts (2.82 ft in diameter on deck level, lower and top mast were made in one piece) {{and most of all}} spars (yards except for the royal yards, spanker boom) were constructed of steel tubing, and many of the rigging was steel cable. The only wooden spars were the four royal yards, the four <b>topgallant</b> <b>masts</b> and the two gaffs of the spanker fore-and-aft sails. She was designed as a so-called [...] "three-island-ship", i.e. a ship that has a midship island (67.2 ft), also called midship bridge or [...] "Liverpool house" [...] (the first ships equipped with that feature came from Liverpool yards), beside the forecastle (41.1 ft) and poop (26 ft) decks. There, inside the Liverpool house, dry and well-ventilated accommodations for crew, mates, and captain were installed, as well as the pantry and chart room. The main helm—a double rudder wheel of 5.8 ft diameter—stood on top, well protected against huge waves. A second helm were near the stern. Under good conditions, the huge barque could reach a speed of 19 kn. Her best 24-hour-run were 376 nm in 1900 under Capt. Hilgendorf. The Potosi was manned by a crew of 40-44. She was the fastest P-liner apart from the five-masted fully rigged ship Preußen which could reach speeds of more than 20 kn, but was less maneuverable.|$|R
5000|$|... 's rig was {{designed}} according to traditional rules and is occasionally modified slightly with trainees in mind.

Each consists of a steel lower mast and topmast and timber <b>topgallant</b> and royal <b>mast.</b> Spars are steel on the lower and topmasts (course, lower topsail and upper topsail yards) and timber above this (topgallant and royal yards). Access to the tops is by a vertical [...] "jacob's ladder" [...] down to the ratlines, rather than inverted futtock shrouds. There is a gold sovereign placed under the foremast where it meets the keel, a tradition supposed to give the ship luck.|$|R

[...] Her usual cargo was usually about 5,500 bales of wool. She was first rigged with fidded royal masts, but this proved to interfere with her stability as there was too much weight aloft. She was then given <b>topgallant</b> and royal <b>masts</b> in one with crossed royal yards over double-topgallants. Loch Vennachar was always in the wool trade to Adelaide and Melbourne, but when an out wool clipper, she also carried passengers and other cargo.|$|R
