The first ending, which follows the original script, ends with both Kelli and Leigh surviving and Kelli getting a call from someone using Kyle's cellphone.|$|E
5|$|On 7 June, the {{battleship}} received {{word that the}} Ranger battalion at Pointe Du Hoc was still isolated {{from the rest of}} the invasion force with low ammunition and mounting casualties; in response, Texas obtained and filled two LCVPs with provisions and ammunition for the Rangers. Upon their return, the LCVPs brought thirty-five wounded Rangers to Texas for treatment of which one died on <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>table.</b> Along with the Rangers, a deceased Coast Guard sailor and twenty-seven prisoners (twenty Germans, four Italians, and three French) were brought to the ship. The prisoners were fed, segregated, and not formally interrogated aboard Texas, due to the ship bombarding targets or standing by to bombard, before being loaded aboard an LST for transfer to England. Later in the day, her main battery rained shells on the enemy-held towns of Formigny and Trévières to break up German troop concentrations. That evening, she bombarded a German mortar battery that had been shelling the beach. Not long after midnight, German planes attacked the ships offshore, and one of them swooped in low on Texass starboard quarter. Her anti-aircraft batteries opened up immediately but failed to hit the intruder. On the morning of 8 June, her guns fired on Isigny, then on a shore battery, and finally on Trévières once more.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: In {{the last}} few years many new {{instruments}} and devices have been developed and introduced into <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> room (OR). A debate has been ongoing about the optimal ergonomic posture for <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> staff. From practical experience, we have learned that <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>tables</b> cannot be adjusted adequately to allow surgeons of different stature to maintain a comfortable posture. The goal {{of this study was to}} establish the most ergonomic table height for the particular physique of the surgeon and the different types of laparoscopic instrument handles that he or she uses. Methods: In a simulated model, two probands of different stature (50 th {BS 50 } and 95 th {BS 95 } percentile) used laparoscopic instruments with four different handle designs (shank, pistol, axial, and rod). The instruments were inserted into a board in three different angles ({IA} = 20 °, 30 °, 40 °). Additionally the elbow angles (EA) of the volunteers were fixed to either 90 ° or 120 °. For every variable (size of surgeon and his or her elbow angle, design of handle, insertion angle of the instrument) the height of the board, as a parameter for the level of the abdominal wall of a patient with pneumoperitioneum, was measured from the floor. Results: All parameters had an effect on <b>the</b> optimal <b>operating</b> <b>table</b> height. <b>The</b> lowest required <b>operating</b> <b>table</b> level was 30 cm, the highest was 60. 5 cm.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Vammalan Konepaja {{made its first}} {{treatment}} table. MD Seppo Suuriniemi’s wife ran a physical therapy clinic in Tampere, and another branch was opened in Vammala. Vammalan Konepaja designed new treatment tables to meet her needs. The products also complemented Instrumentarium’s product range, and Konepaja signed a deal with them to sell and export the company’s treatment tables.In the early 1980s Vammalan Konepaja also started working together with Swedish <b>operating</b> <b>table</b> manufacturer Stille Ab. Their first joint venture was to design a new lift for operating theatres. Soon Konepaja started to make <b>operating</b> <b>table</b> accessories for Stille, {{as well as the}} Stille 1100 hydraulic <b>operating</b> <b>table.</b> As a result of fruitful co-operation, the manufacture of the advanced electro-hydraulic Scandia <b>operating</b> <b>table</b> was moved to Vammalan Konepaja in the late 1980s. After Stille sold the design to German company Berchtold Gmbh, <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>tables</b> continued to be made in Vammala.The largest single order {{to come out of the}} co-operation with Stille was the export of 147 <b>operating</b> <b>tables</b> to Thailand. Vammalan Konepaja received widespread recognition in the field of physiatrics when the Swedish Olympic team made the decision to use the company’s treatment and massage tables at the Calgary Olympics in 1988.|$|R

Officers who responded to the scene incorrectly reported that she did not seem harmed at the time. West herself was under the same impression, however she suffered severe internal injuries and proved to have suffered both a ruptured spleen and a lacerated liver. Her spleen was removed that Friday and, the following Monday, she underwent two more surgeries to stop her liver from bleeding; these ultimately failed in that effort. Doctors said that West knew the extent of her injuries and even visited with Kenny Rogers shortly before her last operation.

When the rally ended, Rabin walked down the city hall steps towards the open door of his car, at which point Amir fired three shots at Rabin with a semi-automatic pistol. Two shots hit Rabin, and the third lightly injured Yoram Rubin, one of Rabin's bodyguards. Rabin was taken to the nearby Ichilov Hospital with considerable delay, where he died on <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>table</b> less than 40 minutes later due to blood loss and a punctured lung. Amir was immediately seized by Rabin's bodyguards. He was later tried, found guilty, and sentenced to life imprisonment.

25|$|The {{critical}} {{procedural step}} in forming the new breast is the collecting and the joining {{of the three}} folds of breast tissue (the medial pillar and the two lateral pillars) of the lower pole of the breast, where it meets the chest. The suturing is critical to supporting and shaping the flaccid breast tissues into a hemispheric breast-mound that well projects from the chest wall—a lifted breast. The supine patient then is elevated {{to a sitting position}} so that the breasts drape naturally, and the surgeon then delineates upon them the incision plan for the resection (cutting and removing) of the excess folds of skin from the lower sides (inferolateral) and the lower midline (inferomedial) of the new breast. Afterwards, the patient is laid supine, and the excess breast skin is cut; to avoid a scar at the inframammary fold, a purse-string closure gathers the excess folds of skin at the lower pole of the breast; in due course, the three joined pillars of skin will integrate to the inframammary fold. Again, the supine patient is elevated to a sitting position so that the surgeon can ascertain the size, shape, and symmetry, or asymmetry, of the corrected breasts. If the degree of breast-lift is satisfactory, the patient is re-laid to <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>table,</b> and the plastic surgeon sutures the incision wounds.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{thalassemia}} major {{are more}} inclined to have a splenectomy. The medical cases of splenectomies have been declining in recent years due to decreased prevalence of hypersplenism in adequately transfused patients. Patients with hypersplenism are inclined to have a lower amount of healthy blood cells in their body than normal and reveal symptoms of anemia. Iron rich patients need a splenectomy to reduce the probability of an iron overload. The different surgical techniques are the open and laparoscopic method. The laparoscopic method requires longer operating time but a shorter recovery period with no surgical scar. If it is unnecessary to remove the entire spleen a partial splenectomy may occur; this method preserves some of the immune function while reducing the probability of hypersplenism. Surgeons who chose Laparoscopic splenectomy must administer an appropriate immunization at least two weeks before the surgery. On <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>table</b> the patient must be placed at a 30˚ to 40˚ position with his or her left arm elevated above the head to properly make the incision. The camera is inserted along with four other trocars: one placed in the left subcostal area, one inserted at the midpoint between the first and third, one 4cm right of the midline, and the fourth positioned on the midline to retract the spleen. Removing the spleen, an organ in under a person’s rib cage on the upper left side of its abdominal, allows the body to regulate the correct amount of healthy cells in the body.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundTo {{identify}} {{the impact of}} weight, table surface, and table type on slipping in a simulation of minimally invasive gynecologic surgery. MethodsA mannequin was placed into increasing Trendelenburg until a slip was observed; the table angle {{at the time of}} the event was measured (slip angle). The influence of mannequin position (supine vs. lithotomy), weight, table surface, and model was evaluated. A linear regression model was used to analyze the data. ResultsMannequin weight, bed surface, and bed type all significantly impacted the slip angles. In general, higher mannequin weights tolerated significantly more Trendelenburg before slipping in the supine position but less in lithotomy compared to lower weights. In lithotomy, the disposable sheet and gelpad performed worse than the bean bag, egg crate foam, and bedsheet. There was no difference in slipping because of bed surface in the supine model. <b>The</b> Skytron <b>operating</b> <b>table</b> performed significantly better than <b>the</b> Steris <b>operating</b> <b>table</b> when tested with the bedsheet. ConclusionOperative position, patient weight, and bed surface together influence the slipping propensity. In lithotomy, heavier patients were more prone to slipping while the inverse was true in supine. The egg crate foam, bean bag, and bedsheet were the best antislip surfaces. <b>Operating</b> room <b>table</b> choice can mitigate slippage...|$|R
