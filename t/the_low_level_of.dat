5|$|The {{panels of}} Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion are painted on light Sundeala boards, a {{material}} Bacon was using {{at the time}} as an inexpensive alternative to canvas. Each bears a single taut sculptural form pitched against a harsh orange background. The orange hue displays inconsistently across the canvasses, due in part to <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> oil in the paint, which resulted in varying rates of absorption into the board. The pallid flesh tones of the figures were achieved by overlaying grey and white brushstrokes, while the figures' props were coloured using a variety of yellow, green, white, and purple tones.|$|E

5|$|Mint Chief Engraver James B. Longacre had, since 1849, {{designed}} coins {{with various}} visages {{of the goddess}} Liberty, based on a bust, Venus Accroupie, {{he had seen in}} a Philadelphia museum on loan from the Vatican. Although the Liberty as used on the three-cent nickel piece is closest to Longacre's experimental cents of 1857 and quarter eagles of 1860, she resembles most of the Chief Engraver's other depictions of Liberty. On the three-cent piece, she wears a coronet with her name on it, and a ribbon binds her hair. For the reverse, Longacre combined the Roman numeral III as rendered on the silver three-cent piece with the laurel wreath used on the 1859 Indian Head cent reverse. Breen suggested that the similarity of design to other Longacre coins has contributed to <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> collector interest in the three-cent nickel.|$|E

40|$|Late Cenozoic marine sequences, {{the late}} Miocene to early Pliocene Sagara Group {{and the middle}} Pliocene to early Pleistocene Kakegawa Group develop in the hilly and coastal area facing to Suruga Bay and Enshunada Sea. These marine sediments are coming into notice for {{establishment}} of the late Cenozoic standard section in Japan by many biostratigraphers, chronostratigraphers and magnetostratigraphers because of their continuous deposition and well-preserved fossil occurrences. The present writer clarified the calcareous nannoplankton flora in the Sagara and Kakegawa Groups with a scanning electron microscope technique and distinguished three calcareous nannoplankton zones : the Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilica Zone, the Reticulofenestra japonica Zone and the Reticulofenestra pacifica Zone in ascendidg order. A revised zonation and zonal nomenclature are presented based on the Japanese data. The Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilica Zone - the interval from indefinite base to <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> Gephyrocapsa caribbeanica. <b>The</b> Reticulofenestra japonica Zone - the interval from <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> Gephyrocapsa caribbeanica to <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> Gephyrocapsa oceanica. <b>The</b> Reticulofenestra pacifica Zone - the interval from <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> Gephyrocapsa oceanica to <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> Gephyrocapsa protohuxleyi. <b>The</b> Gephyrocapsa oceanica Zone - the interval from <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> Gephyrocapsa protohuxleyi to <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> Emiliania huxleyi. <b>The</b> Emiliania huxleyi Zone - the interval from <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> Emiliania huxleyi to dominant Emilliania huxleyi. The Sagara Group is characterized by common occurrence of Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilica and assigned to {{the lower half of}} the Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilica Zone. The Kakegawa Group extends from the middle part of the Reticulofenestra japonica Zone to the upper part of the Reticulofenestra pacifica Zone. The Tamari Formation belongs to the lower part of the Reticulofenestra japonica Zone. Calcareous nannoplankton flora of the Tamari Formation is clearly distinguished from that of the Sagara Group. The calcareous nannoplankton assemblage of the Tamari Formation is characterized by rare occurrence of Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilica and common occurrence of Pseudoemiliania lacunosa. Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary in this area is confirmed in the upper part of the Hosoya Tuff in the Horinouchi Formation based on the occurrence of Gephyrocapsa oceanica...|$|R

Only in the case of Riyadh, where meters exist, a meaningful estimate has been done, resulting in an estimated 34% of non-revenue water. It is broken down into 21% physical losses and 13% commercial losses from undermetering, illegal connections and authorized unbilled consumption such as for mosques. In addition, 24% of billed consumption is not being paid. The overall level is high by international standards.|$|E
