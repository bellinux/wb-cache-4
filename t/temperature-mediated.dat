50|$|Yellow dung flies have {{extremely}} variable phenotypes - {{body size}} and development rate in particular. Proximate causes of variation include juvenile nutrition, temperature, predation, and genetic variation. Much phenotypic plasticity in yellow dung flies {{is a result}} of food (dung) availability in the larval stage, which is often mediated by conspecific competition. Less dung results in more competitors, and more drying results in decreased growth rate and adult body size. Additionally, when exposed to constant temperatures in a laboratory setting, higher temperatures during growth yield smaller flies. Egg volume, but not clutch size, also decreases with increasing temperature. Giving merit to the hypothesis that constraints on physiological processes at the cellular level account for <b>temperature-mediated</b> body size, studies have also shown that S. stercoraria body size varies via gene-by-environment interactions. Different cell lines vary significantly in growth, development, and adult body size in response to food limitation.|$|E

The theoretical part focuses on the stress response of bacteria in general, the mechanism of response to <b>temperature-mediated</b> stress and PHA involvement into the stress response. The aim of experimental work was to study the correlation between the amount of PHA in the biomass of the bacteria and their viability after exposure to <b>temperature-mediated</b> stress. PHA producing bacterial strains Cupriavidus necator H 16, Burkholderia cepacia and Burkholderia sacchari and non-producing mutant strain Cupriavidus necator PHB 4 were used for experimental work. Bacteria accumulated poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), the amount of PHB in the biomass was determined by gas chromatography with FID. Viability of live bacterial cells and cells after exposure to <b>temperature-mediated</b> stress was determined by using flow cytometry. It turned out that the content of PHB in biomass assists bacteria to resist the freezing shock. By comparing the viability of bacteria C. necator H 16 and C. necator PHB 4 after exposure to multiple stresses it also has been observed that PHB increased the resistance of cells against <b>temperature-mediated</b> stress and stress caused by low pH...|$|E

Comparisons of congeneric marine invertebrates reveal that the most warm-adapted species may live closer to their thermal tolerance limits and have lower abilities to increase heat tolerance through acclimation than more cold-adapted species. In crabs and snails, heart function may be of critical importance in establishing thermal tolerance limits. <b>Temperature-mediated</b> shifts in gene expression may be critical in thermal acclimation.

40|$|Global warming {{can affect}} the world’s biota and the {{functioning}} of ecosystems in many indirect ways. Recent evidence indicates that climate change can alter the geographical distribution of parasitic diseases, with potentially drastic conse-quences for their hosts. It {{is also possible that}} warmer conditions could promote the transmission of parasites and raise their local abundance. Here I have compiled experimental data on the effect of temperature on the emergence of infective stages (cercariae) of trematode parasites from their snail intermediate hosts. <b>Temperature-mediated</b> changes in cercarial output varied widely among trematode species, from small reductions to 200 -fold increases in response to a 10 xC rise in temperature, with a geometric mean suggesting an almost 8 -fold increase. Overall, the observed <b>temperature-mediated</b> increases in cercarial output are much more substantial than those expected from basic physiological processes, for which 2 - to 3 -fold increases are normally seen. Some of the most extreme increases in cercarial output may be artefacts of the methods used in the original studies; however, exclusion of these extreme values has little impact on the preceding conclusion. Across both species values and phylogenetically independent contrasts, neither the magnitude of the initial cercarial output nor the shell size of the snail host correlated with the relative increase in cercarial production mediated by rising temperature. In contrast, the latitude from which the snail-trematode association originated correlated negatively with <b>temperature-mediated</b> increases in cercarial production: within the 20 x to 55 x latitude range, trematodes from lower latitudes showed more pronounced temperature-driven increases in cercarial output than those from higher latitudes...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this review {{is the impact of}} {{long-term}} changes in temperature on plant growth and its underlying components. The discussion highlights the extent to which thermal acclimation of metabolism is intrinsically linked to the plasticity of a range of biochemical and morphological traits. The fact that there is often a trade-off between <b>temperature-mediated</b> changes in net assimilation rates (NAR) and biomass allocation [in particular the specific leaf area (SLA) ] when plants are grown at different temperatures is also highlighted. Also discussed is the role of <b>temperature-mediated</b> changes in photosynthesis and respiration in determining NAR values. It is shown that in comparisons that do not take phylogeny into account, fast-growing species exhibit greater temperature-dependent changes in RGR, SLA, and NAR than slow-growing plants. For RGR and NAR, such trends are maintained within phylogenetically independent contrasts (i. e. species adapted to more-favourable habitats consistently exhibit greater <b>temperature-mediated</b> changes than their congeneric counterparts adapted to less-favourable habitats). By contrast, SLA was not consistently more thermally plastic in species from favourable habitats. Interestingly, biomass allocation between leaves and roots was consistently more plastic in slow-growing species within individual phylogenetically independent contrasts, when plants were grown under contrasting temperatures. Finally, how interspecific variations in NAR account for an increasing proportion of variability in RGR as growth temperatures decrease is highlighted. Conversely, SLA played a more dominant role in determining interspecific variability in RGR at higher growth temperatures; thus, the importance of SLA in determining interspecific variation in RGR could potentially increase if annual mean temperatures increase in the future.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the {{behavioral}} performance of adult honey bees is influenced by the temperature experienced during pupal development. Here we explore whether there are <b>temperature-mediated</b> effects on the brain. We raised pupae at different constant temperatures between 29 and 37 °C and performed neuroanatomical analyses of the adult brains. Analyses focused on sensory-input regions in the mushroom bodies, brain areas associated with higher-order processing such as learning and memory. Distinct synaptic complexes [microglomeruli (MG) ] within the mushroom body calyces were visualized by using fluorophore-conjugated phalloidin and an antibody to synapsin. The numbers of MG were different in bees that had been raised at different temperatures, and these differences persisted after the first week of adult life. In the olfactory-input region (lip), MG numbers were highest in bees raised at the temperature normally maintained in brood cells (34. 5 °C) and significantly decreased in bees raised at 1 °C below and above this norm. Interestingly, in the neighboring visual-input region (collar), MG numbers were less affected by temperature. We conclude that thermoregulatory control of brood rearing can generate area- and modality-specific effects on synaptic neuropils in the adult brain. We propose that resulting differences in the synaptic circuitry may affect neuronal plasticity and may underlie <b>temperature-mediated</b> effects on multimodal communication and learning...|$|E

40|$|Variations in {{larval instar}} number are common among arthropods. Here, we assess the {{implications}} of <b>temperature-mediated</b> variations in larval instar number for larval development time, larval growth rates, and juvenile dry weight within the palaemonid shrimp, Palaemonetes varians. In contrast with previous literature, which focuses on terrestrial arthropods, particularly model and pest species often of laboratory lines, we use wild shrimp, which differ in their life history from previous models. Newly-hatched P. varians larvae were first reared at 5, 10, 17, 25, and 30 °C to assess their thermal scope for development. Larvae developed at 17, 25, and 30 °C. At higher temperatures, larvae developed through fewer larval instars. Two dominant developmental pathways were observed; a short pathway of four instars and a long pathway of five instars. Longer developmental pathways of six to seven instars were rarely observed (mostly at lower temperatures) and consisted of additional instars as ‘repeat’ instars; i. e. little developmental advance over the preceding instar. To assess {{the implications of}} <b>temperature-mediated</b> variation in larval instar number, newly-hatched larvae were then reared at 15, 20, and 25 °C. Again, the proportion of larvae developing through four instars increased with temperature. At all temperatures, larval development time and juvenile dry weight were greater for larvae developing through five instars. Importantly, because of the increasing proportion of larvae developing through four instars with increasing temperature, larval traits associated with this pathway (reduced development time and juvenile dry weight) became more dominant. As a consequence of increasing growth rate with temperature, and the shift {{in the proportion of}} larvae developing through four instars, juvenile dry weight was greatest at intermediate temperatures (20 °C). We conclude that at settlement P. varians juveniles do not follow the temperature-size rule; this is of importance for life-history ecology in response to environmental change, as well as for aquaculture applications...|$|E

In some of the previous studies, PNIPAAm brushes were synthesized using conventional ATRP, which limits sample preparation throughput in comparison to the ARGET–ATRP methods described here. Hence, use of ARGET–ATRP synthesis coupled with a carefully controlled shear stress device can significantly provide a faster and accurate means for quantitatively studying the combined effects of polymer brush dynamics and shear forces on bacterial detachment.|$|E

40|$|Ecosystems {{across the}} globe are facing a range of anthropogenically-driven changes, {{including}} biotic invasions, urbanisation and land-use alterations, which can affect ecosystem structure and stability. To manage both native species decline and invasive species spread {{it is imperative that}} we can accurately predict how current global environmental change will affect biotic communities. I examined effects of different land uses at both landscape- and habitat-scales on native (Culex pervigilans) and exotic (Aedes notoscriptus) mosquito distributions in lentic (standing water) freshwater habitats. Because of the importance of land use on habitat characteristics, I expected different land uses would contain different biotic communities, and that mosquitoes would more likely be present in simple communities with fewer predators. Moreover, because habitat disturbance and modification can significantly influence community structure, I expected less diverse pond communities in habitats within highly modified urban and pasture land uses would also be more likely to contain mosquitoes. I found land use affects mosquito presence, and was likely strongly linked with land-use effects on predator presence and taxon richness. Predators were more common in habitats within native forest and tussock grassland, and mosquitoes were almost entirely restricted to urban and pasture habitats. Moreover, local habitat characteristics had a strong influence on both mosquito and predator presence, with deeper and more open habitats supporting greater predator abundance, thereby excluding mosquito larvae. To further investigate the global of climate change on predator-prey interactions involving Ae. notoscriptus and Cx. pervigilans, I conducted two experiments. Firstly, I measured effects of habitat warming and short- and long-term habitat drying on interactions between the two mosquito species and three predatory invertebrates, Anisops wakefieldi backswimmers, Austrolestes colensonis damselflies, and Procordulia smithii dragonflies, which represented predators characteristic of different habitat drying regimes. A second experiment further tested interactions between A. wakefieldi and the two mosquito species in a wider range of temperatures. There was little evidence that short-term habitat drying affected interaction strengths of any of the predator-prey combinations, but strong evidence for the importance of <b>temperature-mediated</b> predation rates which depended on both predator and prey identities. Here, predators characteristic of more temporary hydroperiods showed <b>temperature-mediated</b> predation responses on the two mosquito species: increasing temperature resulted in greater predation on native Cx. pervigilans but not effect on predation on exotic Ae. notoscriptus. The second experiment revealed, again, that predation depended on both temperature and mosquito species with higher predation occurring at increased temperature, but also indicated life history traits could mediate the overall effect of <b>temperature-mediated</b> predation. Overall, I have shown that interactions between temperature, predator identity and mosquito species will be very important in determining the potential for mosquitoes to invade under a changing climate. Considering effects of both climate change and land-use-driven habitat modification on the invasion potential of mosquitoes in freshwater communities will therefore be important for managing both native species decline and spread of invaders. Moreover, research and management decisions on critical species like mosquitoes will need to encompass multiple drivers of climate change at both global and local scales...|$|E

In all experiments, warming stimulated in particular heterotrophic bacterial processes and had an accelerating effect on the temporal development of phytoplankton blooms. This was also mirrored in the build-up and partitioning of organic matter between particulate and dissolved phases. Thus, warming increased both the magnitude and rate of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) build-up, whereas the accumulation of particulate organic carbon (POC) and phosphorus (POP) decreased with rising temperature.

We show that elevated temperature leads to increased root elongation, independently of auxin or factors known to drive <b>temperature-mediated</b> shoot growth. We further demonstrate that brassinosteroid signaling regulates root responses to elevated ambient temperature. Increased growth temperature specifically impacts on the level of the brassinosteroid receptor BRI 1 to downregulate brassinosteroid signaling and mediate root elongation.

We illustrate that the reversible transition between porous and nonporous networks can be accomplished using an electric field or applying a thermal stimulus. These transitions are used to achieve controlled guest release or capture at the solution_solid interface. The electric field and the <b>temperature-mediated</b> methods of guest release are operative at different length scales. While the former triggers the transition and thus guest release at the nanometer scale, the latter is effective over a much larger scale. The flexibility associated with physisorbed self-assembled networks renders this approach an attractive alternative to conventional switchable systems. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Cytosol {{preparations}} {{contain an}} endogenous heat-stable factor which stabilizes the glucocorticoid receptor in its untransformed, non DNA-binding form. Elution of a partially purified {{preparation of this}} stabilizing factor through a metal chelating resin (Chelex- 100) leads {{to the loss of}} its ability to inhibit <b>temperature-mediated</b> transformation of the receptor. Sodium molybdate mimicks the ability of this endogenous metal to stabilize the untransformed receptor, and it too is adsorbed by Chelex resin. When an L-cell cytosol preparation containing the glucocorticoid receptor is passed through a column of Chelex- 100 resin and then incubated at 15 [deg]C, the receptor is rapidly transformed to the DNA-binding state, regardless of whether it is steroid-bound or not. In contrast, whole cytosol containing endogenous metals is transformed to the DNA-binding state only when the receptor is both steroid-bound and exposed to elevated temperature, these data suggest that a metal (or metals) may be involved in conferring the property of ligand-dependency to the transformation process...|$|E
