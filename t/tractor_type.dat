50|$|On March 1, 1912, Tony Jannus piloted a Benoist biplane when Albert Berry {{made the}} first {{parachute}} jump from a moving airplane near St. Louis.

5000|$|Later {{production}} {{machines were}} fitted with the Beardmore engine, as originally intended, as these {{had become more}} plentiful. This version was redesignated the DH.1A. Although testing of the DH.1A showed it {{to be at least}} as good as the F.E.2b, this was hardly a recommendation, as the F.E. was itself already slated for replacement with more modern <b>tractor</b> <b>types.</b> Nonetheless, a further order for 50 DH.1As was placed with Savages. By the time of the DH.1's first flight, a single-seat [...] "follow-up" [...] was already being considered; and by June 1915 the first D.H.2 had already made its maiden flight. Designed essentially as a smaller version of the D.H.1, the D.H. 2 was to become {{of one of the most}} important British fighters of the period.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a wheelslip measurement method for small farm tractors (AGT 835 T) adapted for skidding, with mechanical and hydrostatic mechanical transmissions. The research focused on uphill skidding, as slip values measured in uphill skidding {{are higher than}} in downhill skidding. A comparisonwas made {{of the performance of}} tractors carrying equal load but equipped with mechanical and hydrostatic transmission systems. The hydrostaticdrive causes higher negative load values in downhill skidding, and slightly higher slippage. As for hydrostatic tractors, wheelslip is higher in uphill skidding than in downhill skidding. The increase in the sloping of the terrain causes wheelslip to rise progressively. When a tractor travels uphill,slip is linked to a loss of energy. Wheelslip measurements are therefore important for determining the optimum conditions for individual <b>tractor</b> <b>types...</b>|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} occurrence was the DLG-show 1949 in Frankfurt, {{where the}} first MWM diesel engine was bought. Before the tractors were fitted with MWM engines, Wesseler used Deutz engines, which had a bad durability due to bad lubrication oil quality. MWM engines could also use the bad lubrication oil, they became the standard diesel engines of Wesseler tractors; starting in 1953, Wesseler offered every <b>tractor</b> <b>type</b> with a water-cooled and an air-cooled MWM engine of the same power output. Prometheus gearboxes were used first, later, Wesseler switched to ZF gearboxes. Those used to be progressive in the 1950s {{as well as the}} direct injection MWM diesel engines.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} {{tractive}} efficiency (TE) of MF 285 and U 650 tractors during moldboard plowing were evaluated and compared. Field experiments were {{conducted at the}} Experimental Station, College of Agriculture, Shiraz University, using a randomized complete block design with a 3 * 3 factorial. The soil was sandy clay loam with an average moisture content of 18 % b. d. from zero to 30 cm depth. Test treatments were combinations of three <b>tractor</b> <b>types</b> or conditions (U 650, MF 285 liquid ballasted and MF 285 with no liquid or weight ballast) and three levels of plowing depth (10 - 15 cm, 15 - 20 cm and 20 - 25 cm). Plowing speed was kept constant at about 4 km/h throughout the experiment. The measured or calculated parameters included: tractor drawbar pull and rolling resistance, drive wheel slip and tractor tractive efficiency. Statistical analysis of the test {{results showed that the}} primary difference between the <b>tractor</b> <b>types</b> or conditions was in their wheel slip, such that the average wheel slip of U 650 was lowest (12. 6 %) while that of unballasted MF 285 was highest (27 %) and was reduced to 17. 7 % with liquid ballasting. Also, while growth of unballasted MF 285 wheel slip with increasing plowing depth was drastically high (11 % to 48 %), that of U 650 was quite moderate (9. 7 % to 16. 5 %). Analysis of the calculated values of TE showed that there was no significant changes in the TE of U 650 with increasing plowing depth and that with an average of 73. 8 %, it had a desirable performance. The TE of unballasted MF 285 that was over 75 % at shallow plowing, dropped to 46 % with increasing plowing depth, while water ballasting improved the decreasing trend of TE with plowing depth and raised its minimum value to about 63 %. The overall results of this study showed that unballasted MF 285 tractors had desirable TE only at shallow plowing and that for medium and deep plowing, U 650 or water ballasted MF 285 tractors should be used...|$|R

50|$|Amongst the {{smallest}} non air-cushioned amphibious vehicles are amphibious ATVs (all-terrain vehicles). These saw significant popularity in North America during the 1960s and early 1970s. Typically an amphibious ATV (AATV) is a small, lightweight, off-highway vehicle, constructed from an integral hard plastic or fibreglass bodytub, fitted with six (sometimes eight) driven wheels, with low pressure, balloon tires. With no suspension (other {{than what the}} tires offer) and no steering wheels, directional control is accomplished through skid-steering - just as on a tracked vehicle - either by braking the wheels on the side {{where you want to}} turn, or by applying more throttle to the wheels on the opposite side. Most contemporary designs use garden <b>tractor</b> <b>type</b> engines, that will provide roughly 25 mph top speed on land.|$|E
50|$|On 10 and 17 December 1930 Brandt had {{obtained}} {{an order for}} six complete sets: tractor, trailer and tractor-carrying trailer. To honour its commitments to Vickers, it let the trailers and one tractor be built in Britain. To conform {{to the idea of}} production in France, Brandt delegated the task to build a new <b>tractor</b> <b>type</b> to the Latil company, as it had too little experience itself. The Latil prototype, presented on 7 August 1931 was very much on lines of the British type and strongly resembled the later Universal Carrier: fully tracked and with most of the vehicle covered by an open rectangular superstructure to ensure as large a carrying capacity as possible. Only a small driver's and engine section on the front was armoured on top. On 17 July the commission considered the type ready for troop trials.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the pilots}} of the British Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service arrived in France in 1914 they found {{themselves}} equipped with pusher types too underpowered to carry machine guns {{and still have a}} chance of overtaking the enemy, and <b>tractor</b> <b>types</b> which were difficult to arm for the aggressive pursuit of enemy aircraft because the propeller was in the way. Among other attempts to get around this (such as firing obliquely past the arc of the propeller, and even efforts, doomed to failure, to synchronize the Lewis Gun which was at the time the [...] "standard" [...] British aircraft weapon) was the expedient of firing straight through the propeller arc and [...] "hoping for the best". A high proportion of bullets would in the normal course pass the propeller without striking the blades, and each blade might typically take several hits before there was much danger of its failing, especially if it was bound with tape to prevent splintering (see diagram below, and illustration to the left).|$|R
50|$|Pressurized refuel {{systems were}} {{developed}} in the 1950s and installed on almost all large vehicles. Caterpillar introduced a non-pressurized refueling system in 1998 on the Caterpillar D11 track <b>type</b> <b>tractor</b> replacing the original pressurized system.|$|R
50|$|An {{individual}} Matador missile {{was shipped}} from the Martin plant to its unit in seven wooden crates. A single Matador missile required many vehicles {{to move it}} and its associated support equipment. There was a Transport Vehicle, which was a short wheelbase semi-trailer which carried the missile with the wings removed and attached alongside the fuselage, a Launcher, which was a semi-trailer more than 40 ft long weighing more than 30,000 pounds. There was a Target Selection Van, a Warhead Van, a 60 kW diesel generator, a tug, a hydraulic unit, a mobile Blockhouse, and a truck-mounted hydraulic crane. There were several 2½ and 5 ton trucks (<b>tractor</b> <b>type)</b> to attach to and tow the launchers, Transport Vehicle, and generator. In some squadrons, each launch team had a large trailer in which it stored weapons, ammunition and supplies.|$|E
5000|$|The classic [...] "Farman" [...] pusher had the {{propeller}} [...] "mounted (just) behind the main lifting surface" [...] {{with the engine}} fixed to the lower wing or between the wings, immediately forward of {{the propeller}} in a stub fuselage (that also contained the pilot) called a nacelle. The main difficulty {{with this type of}} pusher design was attaching the tail (empennage); this needed {{to be in the same}} general location as on a tractor aircraft, but its support structure had to avoid the propeller. The earliest examples of pushers relied on a canard but this has serious aerodynamic implications that the early designers were unable to resolve. Typically, mounting the tail was done with a complex wire-braced framework that created a lot of drag. Well before the beginning of the First World War this drag was recognized as just one of the factors that would ensure that a Farman style pusher would have an inferior performance to an otherwise similar <b>tractor</b> <b>type.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Although many differing {{variants}} {{have been}} developed over the years, and new ones are still being devised, most amphibious ATVs share most of the following characteristics. In contrast to today's ANSI definition of an ATV: [...] "a vehicle that travels on low pressure tires, with a seat that is straddled by the (single) operator, and with handlebars for steering control", an AATV is intended for multiple riders, sitting inside, and will usually have two control sticks (and in some cases a steering wheel or joystick) rather than motorcycle-type handle bars as stipulated in the current definition. Typically constructed with a hard plastic or fiberglass watertight body"tub", AATVs usually have six or eight wheels - all driven - with low pressure (around 3 PSI) balloon tires, no suspension (other than what the tires offer) and no steering wheels. Directional control is accomplished through skid-steering - just as on a tracked vehicle - either by braking the wheels on the side {{where you want to}} turn, or by applying more throttle to the wheels on the opposite side. Most contemporary designs use garden <b>tractor</b> <b>type</b> engines, that will provide roughly 25 mph (40 km/h) top speed. AATVs typically do not meet vehicle regulations in most countries, and are therefore strictly Off Highway Vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|A {{flail mower}} {{is a type}} of powered garden/agricultural equipment, which is used to deal with heavier grass/scrub which a normal lawn mower could not cope with. Some smaller models are self-powered, but many are PTO driven implements, which can attach to the three-point hitches found on the rear of most <b>tractors.</b> This <b>type</b> of mower is best used to provide a rough cut to taller grass where contact with loose debris may be {{possible}} such as roadsides.|$|R
2500|$|As {{early as}} 1912, {{designers}} at the British firm Vickers were experimenting with machine gun carrying aircraft. The first concrete {{result was the}} Vickers Experimental Fighting Biplane 1, which featured at the 1913 Aero Show in London. and appeared in developed form as the FB.5 in February 1915. This pioneering fighter, like the Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2b and the Airco DH.1, was a pusher [...] type. These had the engine and propeller behind the pilot, facing backward, {{rather than at the}} front of the aircraft, as in a tractor configuration design. This provided an optimal machine gun position, from which the gun could be fired directly forward without an obstructing propeller, and reloaded and cleared in flight. An important drawback was that pusher designs tended to have an inferior performance to <b>tractor</b> <b>types</b> with the same engine power because of the extra drag created by the struts and rigging necessary to carry the tail unit. The F.E.2d, a more powerful version of the F.E.2b, remained a formidable opponent well into 1917, when pusher fighters were already obsolete. They were simply too slow to catch their quarry.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Main part {{of energy}} {{consumption}} in agricultural mechanization is tillage operations therefore optimization of energy consumption in tillage operation is very important. A management method for system to optimize in agriculture is Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) methodology that this method can {{operate according to}} criteria of the systems. This method states that, which system has better performance? (for example the system for agricultural <b>tractors,</b> <b>type</b> of implements, methods of tillage, planting and harvesting, and etc). Fuel consumption {{is the most important}} factor in terms of energy consumption in tractor because the fuel energy contributes to help tractor to work. Specific draught is important force that measured for investigation of energy consumption of tillage implements, it can show the amount of drawbar force that optimized (for work width 1 meter implements tillage) by using this method. The multiplication of the drawbar force in forward speed factor resulted drawbar power. The most common method is using of tractors drawbar power in mechanized agriculture. Important factor for assessment and determination performance of tractor is drawbar power. Several studies have been showed that about 20 to 55...|$|R
