40|$|This article {{evaluates the}} {{procedures}} {{for determining the}} vial heat transfer coefficient {{and the extent of}} primary drying through manometric temperature measurement (MTM). The vial heat transfer coefficients (Kv) were calculated from the MTM-determined temperature and resistance and compared with Kv values determined by a gravimetric method. The differences between the MTM vial heat transfer coefficients and the gravimetric values are large at low shelf temperature but smaller when higher shelf temperatures were used. The differences also became smaller at higher chamber pressure and smaller when higher resistance materials were being freeze-dried. In all cases, using <b>thermal</b> <b>shields</b> greatly improved the accuracy of the MTM Kv measurement. With use of <b>thermal</b> <b>shields,</b> the thickness of the frozen layer calculated from MTM is in good agreement with values obtained gravimetrically. The heat transfer coefficient “error” is largely {{a direct result of the}} error in the dry layer resistance (ie, MTM-determined resistance is too low). This problem can be minimized if <b>thermal</b> <b>shields</b> are used for freeze-drying. With suitable use of <b>thermal</b> <b>shields,</b> accurate Kv values are obtained by MTM; thus allowing accurate calculations of heat and mass flow rates. The extent of primary drying can be monitored by real-time calculation of the amount of remaining ice using MTM data, thus providing a process analytical tool that greatly improves the freeze-drying process design and control...|$|R

40|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was {{launched}} April 24, 1990, and was deployed April 25 into low Earth orbit (LEO). It was {{soon discovered that}} the metal poles holding the solar arrays were expanding and contracting as the telescope orbited the Earth passing between the sunlight and the Earth s shadow. The expansion and contraction, although very small, was enough to cause the telescope to shake because of thermal-induced jitters, a detrimental effect when trying to take pictures millions of miles away. Therefore, the European Space Agency (ESA, the provider of the solar arrays) built new solar arrays (SA- 11) that contained bi-stem <b>thermal</b> <b>shields</b> which insulated the solar array metal poles. These <b>thermal</b> <b>shields</b> were made of 2 mil thick aluminized-Teflon fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) rings fused together into a circular bellows shape.

50|$|Liquid helium {{is used as}} a coolant {{for most}} superconductive windings, even those with {{critical}} temperatures far above its boiling point of 4.2 K. This is because the lower the temperature, the better superconductive windings work—the higher the currents and magnetic fields they can stand without returning to their nonsuperconductive state. The magnet and coolant are contained in a thermally insulated container (dewar) called a cryostat. To keep the helium from boiling away, the cryostat is usually constructed with an outer jacket containing (significantly cheaper) liquid nitrogen at 77 K. Alternatively, a <b>thermal</b> <b>shield</b> made of conductive material and maintained in 40 K-60 K temperature range, cooled by conductive connections to the cryocooler cold head, is placed around the helium-filled vessel to keep the heat input to the latter at acceptable level.

At temperatures above about 20 K cooling can be achieved without boiling off cryogenic liquids.|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>thermal</b> <b>shields</b> of {{materials}} having low emissivity in vacuum furnaces is well-known. However, the surface {{condition of the}} heat shields {{is one of the}} most important factors governing their efficiency as radiation resistances. The emissivity of the <b>thermal</b> <b>shields</b> dictates the power rating of the heaters in furnace design. The unpolished materials used in the heater tests showed poor performance leading to loss of a signi­ficant percentage of the input power. The present work deals with the refur­bishment of the radiation heat shields used in a furnace for heating graphite structure. The effect of refurbishment of the heat shields by the buffing and subsequently electro­polishing was found to improve the performance of the shields as heat reflectors. The com­position of the electrolyte was chosen in such a way that the large shields of Mo, Inconel and SS can be polished using the same reagents in different ratios.

40|$|AbstractThe Magnet System of the Steady State Superconducting Tokamak (SST- 1) {{has been}} {{completely}} refurbished under the SST- 1 Mission. Since Jan 2009, {{a wide spectrum of}} refurbishment has been undertaken which, includes developing reliable designs and processes leading to the fabrication of leak tight low DC resistances in SST- 1 magnet winding packs, equipping each of the sixteen SST- 1 Toroidal Field (TF) magnets with a supercritical helium cooled bubble type <b>thermal</b> <b>shields</b> and testing each of the prepared TF magnets under representative conditions in cold with nominal currents along with manifolds and isolators in near representative conditions. Each of the sixteen SST- 1 TF magnets has been tested fully and successfully in a dedicated test stand in nineteen campaigns during June 10, 2010 and was concluded on Jan 24, 2011. These campaigns ensured that all the sixteen TF magnets could be charged to their nominal currents of 10000 A in either two-phase or supercritical cooling conditions with leak-tight inter-double pancake resistances being in the range of 150 pico ohms to 1200 pico ohms. The supercritical helium cooled <b>thermal</b> <b>shields</b> welded in the inner bore of the TF magnets have also performed as per the design specifications. Subsequently, the assemblies of the SST- 1 TF magnets and the Poloidal Field (PF) magnets in SST- 1 machine shell have begun. The SST- 1 TF magnets are being assembled in pairs (known as octants) together with a SST- 1 vacuum vessel module, sector of 80 K bubble type <b>thermal</b> <b>shields</b> and a pair of outer-inter-coil-structures. The octant assemblies have been completed. The nine superconducting Poloidal Field (PF) magnets will shortly be assembled being supported from the TF cases.
