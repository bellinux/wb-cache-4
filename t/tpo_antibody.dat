50|$|Activating TRAbs are {{characteristic}} of Graves' disease (autoimmune hyperthyroidism). <b>TPO</b> <b>antibody</b> is measured more easily than the TSH receptor antibody, and so is often used as a surrogate in the diagnosis of Graves' disease. These antibodies activate adenylate cyclase by binding to the TSH receptor. This causes the production of thyroid hormones and subsequent growth and vascularisation of the thyroid. TRAbs are also useful in the diagnosis of Graves' Ophthalmopathy. Although the exact mechanism of how TRAbs induce Graves' Ophthalmopathy is unknown, {{it is likely that}} the antibodies bind to TSH receptors in retro-orbital tissues, causing infiltration of lymphocytes. This inflammatory response leads to cytokine production that causes fibroblasts to produce glycosaminoglycans, leading to ophthalmopathy.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To study {{pregnancy}} {{outcomes in}} relation to thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) status with optimum thyroxine replacement for subclinical hypothyroidism. Materials and Methods: Ninety-eight women with subclinical hypothyroidism were followed up {{until the end of}} their pregnancy. <b>TPO</b> <b>antibody</b> status was performed for 59 women (positive 20, negative 39). Levothyroxine was supplemented to maintain TSH between 0. 3 - 3 mIU/l in all patients, irrespective of TPOAb status. Pregnancy outcomes were noted as pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), antepartum or postpartum hemorrhage, preterm delivery, and spontaneous abortion. Outcomes were compared between 3 groups as per <b>TPO</b> <b>antibody</b> status (positive, negative, and undetermined), which were matched for age and gestational period. Results: Thyroid autoimmunity was noted in 34 % of women screened for <b>TPO</b> <b>antibody.</b> A total of 11 adverse pregnancy outcomes were recorded (4 spontaneous abortions, 4 preterm deliveries, 3 PIH) with {{no significant difference between the}} groups.

Materials and Methods: One thousand thirty consecutive pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic {{over a period of}} 1 year and were carrying a healthy singleton uncomplicated intrauterine pregnancy and consuming iodized salt were recruited for the study. Outcomes of the pregnancy was compared between <b>TPO</b> <b>antibody</b> positive euthyroid women (group 1) and <b>TPO</b> <b>antibody</b> negative euthyroid women (group 2). Results: Out of 1030 women, 164 (18. 9 %) were detected <b>TPO</b> <b>antibody</b> positive with euthyroid status. The mean FT 4 and TSH level were significantly different in those who were TPO Ab positive as compared TPO Ab negative euthyroid pregnant women. No correlation was observed between the maternal age, gestational age and gravidity with anti <b>TPO</b> <b>antibody</b> levels. Eighteen (12 %) women in Group 1 and 5 (3. 3 %) women in Group 2 had miscarriages and the difference was found to be statistically significant (P value of 0. 004). Twenty-one (14 %) women in Group 1 and 5 (3. 3 %) women in Group 2 had preterm deliveries, which was also found to be statistically significantly (p value of 0. 001). Other pregnancy related complications like Intrauterine death, IUGR, preeclampsia and PIH though are present in comparatively higher number in TPO Ab positive euthyroid pregnant women as compared to TPO Ab negative euthyroid pregnant women but this difference was not found to be statistically significant.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the frequency of thyroid diseases in first degree relatives (FDR) of patients with T 1 DM. Subjects and methods Eighty individuals (40 patients with T 1 DM and 40 FDR) were interviewed and blood was sampled for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT 4) and thyroid peroxidase (<b>TPO)</b> <b>antibodies</b> measurement. Autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD 65), islet antigen- 2 (IA 2) and autoantibodies against insulin (AAI) were measured in FDR. Results We found a similar prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in patients with T 1 DM and their FDR (22. 5 % vs. 27. 5 %; p = 0, 79). There were no differences in serum TSH levels (p = 0. 29), FT 4 (p = 0, 45), frequency of abnormal TSH (p = 0. 28), positive <b>TPO</b> <b>antibodies</b> (p = 0. 13), titers of <b>TPO</b> <b>antibodies</b> (in positive cases) between patients with T 1 DM and their FDR (p = 0. 94).

40|$|Context: Subclinical {{hypothyroidism}} (SCH) is stated as mild thyroid failure, is {{more common}} as compared to overt hypothyroidism, is associated with different biochemical abnormalities such as dyslipidemia, and is also having high conversion rate into overt hypothyroidism in patients having thyroid peroxidase (<b>TPO)</b> <b>antibody</b> positive. Lipid abnormalities are controversial in SCH and there is lack of Indian studies showing correlation between lipid abnormalities and TPO positivity in SCH. Hence, we did this study to find the TPO positivity and associated dyslipidemia in SCH patients. Materials and Methods: It was a prospective observational study from January 2015 to December 2015 including fifty adult diagnosed SCH patients presented in outpatient department of Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute, Paschim Vihar, New Delhi. TPO positivity and different lipid abnormalities were studied in those fifty diagnosed SCH patients, and finally, association between <b>TPO</b> <b>antibody</b> and dyslipidemia was calculated. Results: Females were predominant (86 %). TPO was positive in 56 % SCH patients. Dyslipidemia was found in 100 % of SCH patients with positive <b>TPO</b> <b>antibody.</b> In overall, TPO positive patients as well as TPO positive females, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein were significantly high while high-density lipoprotein was insignificant. In males, no significant association was found. Conclusion: In SCH patients, dyslipidemia is significantly associated with TPO positivity, especially in females.

40|$|Strong genetic {{contribution}} {{has been}} demonstrated to influence the development of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) as well as thyroid autoantibody production. In order to assess the relation between CT 60 cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen- 4 (CTLA- 4) gene polymorphism and thyroid autoantibody production, we investigated 180 consecutive newly diagnosed patients with two forms of AITD, 105 with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and 75 with postpartum thyroiditis (PPT). We evaluated thyroid function, measured antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg), and determined CT 60 CTLA- 4 gene polymorphism. In HT, <b>TPO</b> <b>antibody</b> median value was significantly lower in the AA compared to the AG and GG genotypes (65, 122 and 319 U/ml, P < 0 · 005), while the Tg antibody median value was lower in the AA compared to the AG genotype (91 and 189 U/ml, P < 0 · 02). In PPT, the frequency of thyroid autoantibody-positive patients was higher among G-allele-carrying genotypes (P < 0 · 04). Similar to HT, the <b>TPO</b> <b>antibody</b> median value was lower in the AA compared to the AG and GG genotypes (12, 130 and 423 U/ml, P < 0 · 006). Hypothyroid PPT patients were more often thyroid autoantibody-positive (P < 0 · 005) and the <b>TPO</b> <b>antibody</b> median value was higher compared to hyperthyroid PPT patients (500 and 32 U/ml, P < 0 · 0001). The frequency of the G-allele was significantly higher among hypothyroid patients (P < 0 · 05).

Relatives of AITD patients carry a risk to contract AITD themselves. The 5 -year risk can be quantified by the so-called Thyroid Events Amsterdam-score, based on serum thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroid peroxidase (TPO) -antibodies and family history. Subjects at risk may ask {{what they can do}} to prevent development of AITD. This review summarizes what is known about modulation of exposure to environmental factors in terms of AITD prevention. To stop smoking decreases the risk on Graves disease but increases the risk on Hashimoto disease. Moderate alcohol intake provides some protection against both Graves and Hashimoto disease.

These data suggest that TPO-specific B cells are involved in antigen presentation to sensitized T cells and are supported by the ability of spleen cells from TPO cell-injected (but not control) mice to secrete TPO antibodies spontaneously in culture.

No such studies, however, have been performed for thyroid peroxidase (TPO), the major autoantigen in human thyroiditis. We constructed plasmid and adenovirus vectors for in vivo expression of TPO. BALB/c mice were immunized directly by intramuscular injection of TPO-plasmid or TPO-adenovirus, as well as by subcutaneous injection of dendritic cells (DC) infected previously with TPO-adenovirus. Intramuscular TPO-adenovirus induced the highest, and TPO-plasmid the lowest, <b>TPO</b> <b>antibody</b> titres. Mice injected with TPO-transfected DC developed intermediate levels. Antibodies generated by all three approaches had similar affinities (Kd ∼ 10 − 9 M) and recognized TPO expressed on the cell-surface. Their epitopes were analysed in competition assays using monoclonal human autoantibodies that define the TPO immunodominant region (IDR) recognized by patients with thyroid autoimmune disease. Surprisingly, high titre antibodies generated using adenovirus interacted with diverse TPO epitopes largely outside the IDR, whereas low titre antibodies induced by DNA-plasmid recognized restricted epitopes in the IDR. This inverse relationship between antibody titre and restriction to the IDR is likely to be due to epitope spreading following strong antigenic stimulation provided by the adenovirus vector. However, <b>TPO</b> <b>antibody</b> epitope spreading does not occur in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, despite high autoantibody levels.

Objective To investigate the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction and thyroid peroxidase- specific (<b>TPO)</b> <b>antibodies</b> in a large cohort of patients with nonsegmental vitiligo in order to help decide whether routine screening is justified. Methods A total of 434 adults with nonsegmental vitiligo who were referred to our institute were enrolled. Thyroid function and anti-TPO antibody titres were assessed in those patients who had no history of thyroid disease or recent thyroid screening. Results Forty-three patients had already been diagnosed with thyroid dysfunction, and in 27 patients the general practitioner had performed a thyroid function test with negative results < 3 months previously. In these patients, thyroid function assessment was not repeated. The remaining 364 patients were screened for thyroid dysfunction. Overt hypothyroidism was newly diagnosed in three (0. 8 %) patients; subclinical disease was found in 10 (2. 7 %) patients and increased levels of <b>TPO</b> <b>antibodies,</b> without thyroid disease, were found in 49 (13. 5 %) patients. An elevated risk for thyroid disease was found among older women and in women with a positive family history of thyroid disease.

40|$|Controlled ovarian {{hyperstimulation}} {{could lead}} to opposing effects on thyroid function. Therefore, in a prospective study of 65 women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, thyroid hormones, T 4 -binding globulin, <b>TPO</b> <b>antibodies,</b> gonadotropins, estradiol, and PRL were measured before and after controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. After ovarian stimulation (mean +/- SE of mean) : free T 4 decreased, 14. 4 +/- 0. 2 vs. 12. 9 +/- 0. 2 pmol/L (P < 0. 0001); thyroid-stimulating hormone increased, 2. 3 +/- 0. 3 vs. 3. 0 +/- 0. 4 mU/L (P < 0. 0001); T 4 -binding globulin increased, 25. 2 +/- 0. 7 vs. 33. 9 +/- 0. 9 mg/L (P < 0. 0001); total T 4 increased, 98. 1 +/- 2. 3 vs. 114. 6 +/- 2. 5 nmol/L (P < 0. 0001); total T 3 increased, 2. 0 +/- 0. 04 vs. 2. 3 +/- 0. 07 nmol/L (P < 0. 0001); <b>TPO</b> <b>antibodies</b> decreased, 370 +/- 233 U/mL vs. 355 +/- 224 U/mL (P < 0. 0001); LH decreased, 8. 1 +/- 1. 1 vs. 0. 4 +/- 0. 1 U/L (P < 0. 0001); FSH did not change, 6. 5 +/- 0. 6 vs. 7. 9 +/- 0. 9 U/L (P = 0. 08); human CG increased, < 2 +/- 0. 0 vs. 195 +/- 16 U/L (P < 0. 0001); estradiol increased, 359. 3 +/- 25. 9 pmol/L vs. 3491. 8 +/- 298. 3 pmol/L (P < 0. 0001); and PRL increased, 0. 23 +/- 0. 02 vs. 0. 95 +/- 0. 06 U/L (P < 0. 0001).

40|$|Objective: Thyroid {{eye disease}} (TED), an {{autoimmune}} inflammatory process involving the orbital tissues around the eye, {{is the most}} common extra-thyroidal manifestation of Graves’ disease (GD). Due to changes in the patient’s appearance, TED is a socially and visually disabling condition with significant impacts on quality of life. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess predictors of strabismus, a severe manifestation of TED. Design: Single-institution retrospective case-control study. Cases of Graves’ ophthalmopathy patients with strabismus were matched 1 : 1 to controls of Graves’ ophthalmopathy patients without strabismus by age and sex. Patients: Patients ≥ 18  years old with severe Graves’ ophthalmopathy who received their medical care at UCLA with strabismus between 2012 and 2015. Measurements: Eligibility criteria for cases was a diagnosis of Graves’ ophthalmopathy with a subsequent diagnosis of strabismus. Using conditional logistic regression, the odds ratios of developing strabismus following the diagnosis of Graves’ disease were assessed. The prognostic indicators assessed include race, ethnicity, cigarette smoking (active), serum thyroid peroxidase (<b>TPO)</b> <b>antibody</b> positivity, serum thyroglobulin (Tg) antibody positivity, antithyroidal medication use, and steroid use. Results: The study sample (45 cases 1 : 1 matched against 45 controls) was comprised primarily of non-Hispanic, non-Latino Caucasian women with TED (mean ± SD age 63. 0  ±  13. 1  years). There were no significant predictors for the development of strabismus, including cigarette smoking (active), serum thyroid peroxidase (<b>TPO)</b> <b>antibody</b> positivity, serum thyroglobulin (Tg) antibody positivity, antithyroidal medication, and steroid use. Conclusions: No significant predictors of strabismus, a severe manifestation of Graves’ ophthalmopathy, were identified following a diagnosis of TED in this study...|$|E
40|$|Postpartum thyroid {{dysfunction}} (PPTD) is characterised by transient hyperthyroidism occurring about 14 weeks postpartum, {{followed by}} transient hypothyroidism that presents at 19 weeks (1 – 3). Hyper- or hypothyroid-ism may occur alone. The condition, a destructive thyroiditis, predominantly occurs {{in patients with}} positive titres of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) auto-antibody (the microsomal antibody) seen in 10 % of women at approximately 16 weeks gestation (4). The titre of these antibodies is known to decrease during gestation, but increases dramatically in the postpartum period (5). However, only about 50 % of women found to be <b>TPO</b> <b>antibody</b> positive during pregnancy will develop PPTD.

40|$|Background: Thyroid {{autoimmunity}} {{can cause}} several forms of thyroid disorders i. e. Grave’s disease, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, atrophic autoimmune thyroiditis, post-partum thyroidits etc. Cytological diagnosis may be sometimes difficult is some cases. In such conditions, cytology along with serological tests aid at reaching a correct diagnosis. Hence, {{this study was}} undertaken to evaluate the serum level of anti-TPO antibody with respect to serum concentrations of thyroid hormones and its importance in diagnosing autoimmune thyroiditis. Material and Methods: This study {{was carried out in}} the department of pathology from June 2013 -May 2014. Patients coming to the department of pathology TUTH, Maharajgunj for FNA of thyroid were included. TFT level was noted and anti <b>TPO</b> <b>antibody</b> level was evaluated by CLIA. Results: Ninety-five thyroid FNAC was included in the study, which comprises of 16. 8 % males and 83. 2 % females with a M: F 1 : 4. 9. Maximum number of cases was seen in the age range 21 - 30 years (25. 3 %), mean age being 40. 4 years. The cytological diagnosis comprised colloid goiter(43. 2 %), lymphocytic thyroiditis (25. 3 %), Hashimoto thyroiditis(18. 9 %). Out of 42 cases of autoimmune thyroiditis diagnosed cytologically, 16 (38 %) were hypothyroid, 4 (9. 5 %) hyperthyroid, 8 (19 %) sub-clinical hypothyroid and 14 (33. 5 %) were euthyroid. The sensitivity and specificity of positive anti TPO in correctly identifying autoimmune thyroiditis was 85. 7 % and 79. 2 % respectively. The positive and negative predictive value for the test was 76. 5 % and 87. 5 % respectively. Conclusion: Nodular goitre can harbour a certain per cent of autoimmune thyroiditis and in such cases anti <b>TPO</b> <b>antibody</b> level along with cytodiagnosis appears to be helpful. </p...|$|E
40|$|Wild-type and mutant thyroid {{peroxidase}} (TPO) {{was expressed}} in a Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) -based transient expression system in Chinese hamster ovary-K 1 cells. Twenty four hours after transfection proteins immunoreactive with <b>TPO</b> <b>antibodies</b> could be detected on a Western blot. Peroxidase activity was assayed using both the guaiacol and the I 3 - assay. Addition of hematin was necessary to obtain enzymatic active TPO. Thyroid peroxidase complementary DNA constructs containing mutations originally found in patients with hereditary congenital hypothyroidism caused by total iodide organification defects were analyzed using these techniques. In all cases TPO was expressed as shown by Western blotting and immunostaining. Enzymatic activity (measured by guaiacol and iodide oxidation assay) was below the detection level in {{four out of five}} mutants. The only mutant yielding TPO with enzymatic activity was G 1858 A (Gly 590 Ser). However, the mutation could affect splicing of TPO messenger RNA, leading to inactive TPO, because it is located at the exon 10 /intron 10 borde...|$|R
40|$|Thyroglobulin (TG) and {{thyroperoxidase}} (TPO), both {{involved in}} thyroid hormone synthesis, represent major autoantigens in thyroid autoimmune disease. Despite numerous studies, the emergence, pathophysiological significance {{and role of}} autoantibodies to TG and TPO remain elusive. The recent identification of a new category of thyroid-specific autoantibody interacting with both TG and TPO (TGPO autoantibodies) offers a new opportunity {{in the study of}} thyroid autoimmunity. To gain a better insight into the significance of these TGPO autoantibodies, measurement in individual samples appeared necessary. The unique property of TGPO autoantibodies, simultaneous binding to TG and TPO, was used to set up a sandwich method which combined coated TG and radio-iodinated TPO. This method was found to be strictly specific for TGPO autoantibodies and sensitive enough to assay TGPO autoantibodies in serum. In humans, TGPO autoantibodies were found in most of the sera with high TG and TPO autoantibody titres, but not in sera negative for TG autoantibodies, whatever the TPO autoantibody titre. Furthermore, high TGPO autoantibody titres were found in sera strongly cytotoxic for cultured porcine thyroid cells. However, significant correlation of TGPO autoantibody titre was observed neither with TG and TPO autoantibody titres (n = 48) nor with complement-dependent cytotoxicity (n = 50). TGPO antibody assay was also performed in individual plasma of CBA/J mice immunized with either human TG (n = 6) or human TPO (n = 6). Immunization with TG induced high levels of not only TG but also TGPO antibodies, which exhibited a strong reactivity for TPO and whose binding to TG and TPO was fully inhibited by TG. In contrast, immunization with TPO induced high levels of only specific <b>TPO</b> <b>antibodies</b> accompanied by low levels of specific TG antibodies. In this case TGPO antibodies were not detected. Of note, TG- and TPO-immunized mice mounted an immune response against their own TG, but did not exhibit histological signs of thyroiditis. Large panels of TG and TPO MoAbs were also investigated with this method: 18 / 25 TG MoAbs and only 1 / 13 TPO MoAbs were found cross-reactive. Taken together, these data provide evidence that TGPO antibodies are effectively present in individual patients and TG-immunized mice, are different from specific TG and <b>TPO</b> <b>antibodies,</b> and may derive from natural B cell repertoire by autoimmune processes involving TG and not TPO...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{disulfide}} isomerase (PDI), {{one of the}} ER-resident molecular chaperones, {{forms and}} isomerizes disulfide bonds. This study attempts to investigate the effect of PDI expression level on specific productivity (q) of recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (rCHO) cells producing thrombopoietin (<b>TPO)</b> and <b>antibody</b> (Ab). To regulate the PDI expression level, the Tet-Off system was introduced in TPO and Ab producing CHO cells, and stable Tet-Off cells (TPO-Tet-Off and Ab-Tet-Off) were screened using the luciferase assay. The doxycycline-regulated PDI expression system in Tet-Off rCHO cells (Tet-TPO-PDI and Tet-Ab-PDI) was established by the cotransfection of pTRE-PDI and pTK-Hyg expression vector into TPO-Tet-Off and Ab-Tet-Off cells, respectively. Subsequent screening was done by Western blot analysis of PDI and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of the secreted <b>TPO</b> and <b>antibody.</b> We cultured two Tet-TPO-PDI and two Tet-Ab-PDI clones, and all these clones showed an average of 2. 5 -fold increase in PDI expression {{when compared to the}} basal level. In both these cell lines the PDI expression was tightly controlled by various concentrations of doxycycline. The q of TPO (qTPO) was unaffected but that of antibody producing cells was increased by 15 - 27 % due to the PDI expression level...|$|R
