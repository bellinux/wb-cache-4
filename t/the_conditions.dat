30|$|<b>The</b> <b>Condition</b> option {{has to be}} used in {{combination}} with the Observe option and can be used both in request and response messages. In a GET request message, <b>the</b> <b>Condition</b> option represents <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>the</b> client wants to apply to the observation relationship. It is used to describe the resource states the client is interested in. In response to the initial GET request message, <b>the</b> <b>Condition</b> option, together with the Observe option, indicates that the client has been added to the list of observers and that notifications will be sent only when the resource state meets <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> specified in <b>the</b> <b>Condition</b> option. In all further notifications, <b>the</b> <b>Condition</b> option identifies <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> to which <b>the</b> notification applies. In the following subsections we will further describe the semantics and usage of <b>the</b> <b>Condition</b> option, illustrating <b>the</b> capabilities of this extension.|$|R

Bosnia's chances of joining NATO may depend on Serbia's attitude towards the alliance, since the leadership of Republika Srpska might be reluctant to go against Serbian interests.

5|$|Although the {{nucleic base}} of {{guanosine}} and 2'-deoxyguanosine {{does have an}} exocyclic amino group, its basicity is low to an extent {{that it does not}} react with phosphoramidites under <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> of the coupling reaction. However, a phosphoramidite derived from the N2-unprotected 5'-O-DMT-2'-deoxyguanosine is poorly soluble in acetonitrile, the solvent commonly used in oligonucleotide synthesis. In contrast, the N2-protected versions of the same compound dissolve in acetonitrile well and hence are widely used. Nucleic bases adenine and cytosine bear the exocyclic amino groups reactive with the activated phosphoramidites under <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> of the coupling reaction. By the use of additional steps in the synthetic cycle or alternative coupling agents and solvent systems, the oligonucleotide chain assembly may be carried out using dA and dC phosphoramidites with unprotected amino groups. However, these approaches currently remain in the research stage. In routine oligonucleotide synthesis, exocyclic amino groups in nucleosides are kept permanently protected over {{the entire length of the}} oligonucleotide chain assembly.|$|E
