Needless to say, {{the very idea of}} classification is premised on, and engenders, inequality. <b>Therein</b> <b>lies</b> <b>the</b> paradox of equality jurisprudence. The necessity of differentiation is even more paramount in modern society with its increasingly complicated problems. Joseph Tussman and Jacobus tenBroek have proposed the doctrine of reasonable classification as the solution, whereby the legislation defines the class that includes all who are similarly situated for the purpose of the law and none who are not.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{claims that}} {{underlying}} the naturalisation {{of teaching and}} learning of English in the Malaysian education system are ideological pressures and political dogmas, often emerging from colonial, urban/rural and even local ethnic conflicts and hierarchies.

As a profession, school psychology is concerned with providing services to a broad constituency base, with children and youth at the center. Because the work of school psychologists concerns helping children, {{there is a huge}} professional and ethical responsibility to ensure that what we do or the treatments we recommend have the greatest potential to result in the greatest amount of good. It is therefore important to understand the extant intervention literature base including its conceptual underpinnings, data-based findings, and contexts to which results can be generalized to benefit the children we serve. <b>Therein</b> <b>lie</b> <b>the</b> strengths of the emerging literature on empirically supported treatments (ESTs). Hughes, in her article, “The Essential Role of Theory in the Science of Treating Children: Beyond Empirically Supported Treatments,” [this issue] raises a variety issues around ESTs that warrant consideration by theoreticians and empiricists alike.
