40|$|When a {{spectacle}} wearer enters a warm environment {{after having been}} in a cooler one, his/her spectacles may ‘mist up’ due {{to the formation of}} condensation on the lens surface. Both the physical properties of the spectacle lens and a number of environmental factors determine how long spectacles take <b>to</b> <b>demist.</b> The relative misting performance of crown glass, CR 39 and polycarbonate spectacle lenses were assessed using a novel technique. A box in which the environmental conditions could be controlled was used first to cool the lens and then to warm it. This change in temperature caused condensation to form on the lens surface. By projecting the image of a grating through the lens onto a linear array of photodiodes it was possible to measure the contrast transmission of the spectacle lens as it demister. Each lens type misted and demisted in a characteristic way. The polycarbonate lens demisted more rapidly than the CR 39 lens which, in turn, demisted more rapidly than the glass lens. This indicates that polycarbonate spectacle lenses should be used in conditions where the adverse effects of spectacle misting need to be minimised...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Heating {{elements}} are commonly embedded in vehicle glazing, {{usually in the}} form of arrays of conductors, <b>to</b> provide a <b>demisting</b> or deicing function. Numerical models, based on representative vehicle geometry and simple conductor arrays, have been used to investigate the potential impact of such structures on the electromagnetic characteristics of vehicles. The results suggest that window heaters may significantly change both the emissions and immunity characteristics of vehicles. It is therefore concluded that it is essential to represent such features in electromagnetic models that are to be used in support of automotive EMC analysis. These results also have corresponding implications for the selection of vehicles in both emissions and immunity testing...|$|R
40|$|Vehicle air {{conditioning}} (A/C) systems significantly increase the fuel use and tailpipe emissions of automobiles. In addition, emissions of the A/C refrigerant are greenhouse gases. In 2002, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) determined the U. S. national and state-by-state fuel use impact of {{air conditioning}} in light duty vehicles. In 2003, we expanded the analysis to cover Europe and Japan. With {{the assistance of}} the automotive climate control community, we have updated the analysis <b>to</b> include <b>demisting,</b> soak temperatures that vary with vehicle type, simplified clothing assumptions, and improved A/C compressor power definition. The updated NREL study shows that the United States uses 7. 0 billion gallons (26. 4 billion liters) of fuel a year for vehicle air conditioning, equivalent to 5. 5 % of the total national fuel use and 9. 5 % of the imported crude oil. If all vehicles had air conditioning, the EU would use 1. 8 billion gallons (6. 9 billion liters) of fuel per year or 3. 2 % of total vehicle fuel consumption. Japan would use 0. 5 billion gallons (1. 7 billion liters) or 3. 4 % of total vehicle fuel consumption. Converting the fuel consumption data into CO 2 emissions determines the indirect impact of air conditioning on the climate. We also determined the magnitude of the potential reduction in fuel use due to incremental improvements in A/C coefficient of performance (COP) over a baseline and the potential fuel saved per vehicle. For example, with a 25 % improvement in A/C COP, a car in Arizona could save 15. 7 gallons per year. These data highlight the potential to reduce operational costs, A/C fuel use, and CO 2 emissions by implementing advanced vehicle climate control technologies. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{standardize}} patient handover in {{the chain}} of emergency care a handover guideline was developed. The main guideline recommendation is <b>to</b> use the <b>DeMIST</b> model (Demographics, Mechanism of Injury/illness, Injury/Illness, Signs, Treatment given) to structure pre-hospital notification and handover. To benefit from the new guideline, guideline adherence is necessary. As adherence to guidelines in emergency care settings is variable, {{there is a need to}} systematically implement the new guideline. For implementation of the guideline we developed a e-learning program tailored to influencing factors. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this e-learning program to improve emergency care professionals' adherence to the handover guideline during pre-hospital notification and handover {{in the chain}} of emergency medical service (EMS), emergency medical dispatch (EMD), and emergency department (ED). METHODS: A prospective pre-test post-test study was conducted. The intervention was a tailored e-learning program that was offered to ambulance crew and emergency medical dispatchers (n= 88). Data on adherence included pre-hospital notifications and handovers and were collected through observations and audiotapes before and after the e-learning program. Data were analyzed using X(2) -tests and t-tests. RESULTS: In total, 78 / 88 (88. 6 %) professionals followed the e-learning program. During pre- and post-test, 146 and 169 handovers were observed respectively. After the e-learning program, no significant difference in the number of handovers with the DeMIST model (77. 9 % vs. 73. 1 %, p=. 319) and the number of handovers with the correct sequence of the DeMIST model (69. 9 % vs. 70. 5 %, p=. 159) existed. During the handover, the number of questions by ED staff and interruptions significantly increased from 49. 0 % to 68. 9 % and from 15. 2 % to 52. 7 % respectively (both p=. 000). Most handovers were performed after patient transfer, this did not change after the intervention (p=. 167). The number of handovers where information was documented during handover slightly increased from 26. 9 % to 29. 3 % (p=. 632). CONCLUSIONS: The tailored e-learning program did not improve adherence to a handover guideline {{in the chain of}} emergency care. Results show a relatively high baseline adherence rate to usage and correct sequence of the DeMIST model. Improvements in the handover process can be made on the documentation of information during handover, the number of interruptions and questions, and the handover moment...|$|R
