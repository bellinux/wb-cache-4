The English Magna Carta of 1215 inspired the right to petition and to trial by jury, for example, while the English Bill of Rights of 1689 provided an early precedent for the right <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> bear arms (although this applied only to Protestants) and prohibited cruel and unusual punishment.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{theology}} of Twelvers, the Twelve Imams are exemplary human individuals who not only rule over the community with justice, but also are able <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> interpret sharia and the esoteric meaning of the Quran. Muhammad and Imams' words and deeds are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin (known as ismah, or infallibility) and must be chosen by divine decree, or nass, through the Prophet.|$|E
5|$|On June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States held in District of Columbia v. Heller {{that the}} city's 1976 handgun ban {{violated}} the right <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> bear arms as protected under the Second Amendment. However, the ruling does not prohibit {{all forms of}} gun control; laws requiring firearm registration remain in place, as does the city's assault weapon ban. In addition to the District's own Metropolitan Police Department, many federal law enforcement agencies have jurisdiction in the city as well; most visibly the U.S. Park Police, founded in 1791.|$|E

5|$|The Second Amendment {{protects the}} {{individual}} right <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> bear arms. The concept {{of such a}} right existed within English common law long before {{the enactment of the}} Bill of Rights. First codified in the English Bill of Rights of 1689 (but there only applying to Protestants), this right was enshrined in fundamental laws of several American states during the Revolutionary era, including the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights and the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776. Long a controversial issue in American political, legal, and social discourse, the Second Amendment has been at the heart of several Supreme Court decisions.|$|E
5|$|The gun {{law in the}} Czech Republic {{is quite}} liberal. It is mostly caused {{by the fact that}} after the fall of {{communist}} regime people wanted to regain their rights <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> bear arms and these needs resulted in passing quite liberal legislation in 1995, which surpassed the previous restrictive communist enactment. The law became widely accepted and led to quite massive civilian arming. Especially many businessmen felt the actual need to obtain a firearm because the times shortly after the Velvet Revolution are known for the rise in organized crime often related to the economic transformation in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|These {{conspiracy}} theorists, {{who are all}} strong {{believers in}} a right <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> bear arms, are extremely fearful that the passing of any gun control legislation will be later followed by the abolishment of personal gun ownership and a campaign of gun confiscation, and that the refugee camps of emergency management agencies such as FEMA {{will be used for}} the internment of suspected subversives, making little effort to distinguish true threats to the New World Order from pacifist dissidents.|$|E

5|$|CMLL held a 15-woman torneo cibernetico {{elimination}} {{match on}} June 5, 1992 {{to determine the}} two women who would fight for the newly created CMLL World Women's champion the following week. La Diabólica was originally scheduled to work the match, but did not appear {{which led to the}} uneven sides in the elimination match. Several of the participants had recently joined CMLL, leaving the Universal Wrestling Association to join CMLL and its recently restarted women's division. Zuleyma was the reigning UWA World Women's Championship going into the match and CMLL allowed her <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> defend the UWA championship in the years following Zuleyma's jump to CMLL. The finals came down to Lola Gonzales, a pioneer for women's wrestling in Mexico, and Bull Nakano, a Japanese wrestler that worked regularly for CMLL. The following week, on June 12, 1993 Bull Nakano became the first CMLL World Women's Champion by virtue of her victory over Lola Gonzales.|$|E
5|$|Million Dollar Challenge is a {{poker game}} show where amateur poker players attempt to defeat celebrities, {{professional}} poker players and, eventually, Daniel Negreanu {{in order to}} win the show's grand prize, $1 million. In the first round, the amateur (with Negreanu at their side, acting as their coach and lending advice) must defeat a celebrity such as Jayde Nicole, Jerome Bettis, Joanna Krupa, John Salley or Tito Ortiz. If the contestant is able to defeat the celebrity the contestant wins a trip to the Bahamas and advances to the second round. In the second round, the amateur (with Negreanu now helping them from a sound proof booth, giving them advice through a listening device in the amateur's ear) must defeat a professional poker player such as Vanessa Rousso, Barry Greenstein, Joe Cada or Chris Moneymaker. If the contestant is able to defeat the professional the contestant wins $25,000 in addition to the trip to the Bahamas. At this point, the amateur has a decision to make. Keep the money and walk away $25,000 richer, or risk the money (the trip is still theirs <b>to</b> <b>keep)</b> <b>and</b> play Daniel Negreanu heads-up for $100,000, knowing that if they lose they walk away with nothing but the trip to the Bahamas. In the season finale, the champions from each episode compete against each other in a sit-n-go tournament, the winner of which plays Negreanu for $1 million.|$|E
5|$|The Southeastern Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs (eventually renamed as the Southeastern Association of Colored Women’s Clubs) elected Bethune as {{president}} after its first conference in 1920 at the Tuskegee Institute. They intended {{to reach out}} to Southern Women (specifically white women) for support and unity in gaining rights for black women. The women met in Memphis, Tennessee to discuss interracial problems. In many respects, all of the women agreed about what needed to be changed, until they came to the topic of suffrage. The white women at the conference tried to strike down a resolution on black suffrage. The SACWC responded by issuing a pamphlet entitled Southern Negro Women and Race Co-Operation; it delineated their demands regarding conditions in domestic service, child welfare, conditions of travel, education, lynching, the public press, and voting rights. The group went on to help register black women to vote after they were granted suffrage a few months later after passage of the constitutional amendment. Within the state, however, and in other southern states, black men and women were largely disenfranchised by discriminatory application of literacy and comprehension tests, as well as requirements to pay poll taxes, lengthy residency requirements, and the need <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> display records.|$|E

25|$|State level laws vary {{significantly}} in their form, content, {{and level of}} restriction. Forty-four states have a provision in their state constitutions similar to the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects the right <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> bear arms. The exceptions are California, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, and New York. In New York, however, the statutory civil rights laws contain a provision virtually identical to the Second Amendment. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court held in McDonald v. Chicago that the protections of the Second Amendment <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> bear arms for self-defense in one's home apply against state governments and their political subdivisions.|$|E
