5|$|Well-known {{species such}} as the great white shark, tiger shark, blue shark, mako shark, <b>thresher</b> <b>shark,</b> and hammerhead shark are apex predators—organisms {{at the top of}} their {{underwater}} food chain. Many shark populations are threatened by human activities.|$|E
5|$|Morphological and {{allozyme}} analyses {{have agreed}} that the common thresher is basal to the clade formed by the bigeye thresher and the pelagic thresher (A. pelagicus). The closest relative of this species within the family may be a fourth, unrecognized <b>thresher</b> <b>shark</b> species off Baja California, reported from allozyme evidence by Blaise Eitner in 1995. However, {{the existence of this}} fourth species has yet to be confirmed by other sources.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thresher</b> <b>sharks</b> are {{classified}} as prized game fish in the United States and South Africa. Common <b>thresher</b> <b>sharks</b> are {{the target of a}} popular recreational fishery off Baja, Mexico. <b>Thresher</b> <b>sharks</b> are farmed in some areas for their value as both a recreational sport fish and for commercial products derived from their flesh.|$|R
40|$|<b>Thresher</b> <b>sharks</b> are {{distributed}} circumglobally in the Atlantic, Pacific, Mediterranean and Indian Oceans. <b>Thresher</b> <b>sharks</b> include the common thresher (Alopias vulpinus), bigeye thresher (A. superciliosus), and pelagic thresher (A. pelagicus), the former being the largest. Unusual landings of this shark by long liners were noticed along the Malabar coast in 2005. The details of its fishery and some observations {{made on the}} biology are presented...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Thresher</b> <b>sharks</b> are solitary creatures which keep to themselves. It {{is known}} that {{thresher}} populations of the Indian Ocean are separated by depth and space according to sex. Some species however do occasionally hunt {{in a group of}} two or three contrary to their solitary nature. All species are noted for their highly migratory or oceanodromous habits. When hunting schooling fish, <b>thresher</b> <b>sharks</b> are known to [...] "slap" [...] the water, herding and stunning prey. The elongated tail is used to swat smaller fish, stunning them before feeding. <b>Thresher</b> <b>sharks</b> {{are one of the few}} shark species known to jump fully out of the water, making turns like dolphins; this behavior is called breaching.|$|R
5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} the common thresher, as Squalus vulpinus, was written by French naturalist Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre in the 1788 Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique des trois règnes de la nature. In 1810, Constantine Samuel Rafinesque described Alopias macrourus from a <b>thresher</b> <b>shark</b> caught off Sicily. Later authors recognized the genus Alopias as valid while synonymizing A. macrourus with S. vulpinus, and thus the common thresher's scientific name became Alopias vulpinus.|$|E
5|$|While {{any large}} shark {{is capable of}} inflicting injury and thus merits respect, the common {{thresher}} poses little danger to humans. Most divers report that they are shy and difficult to approach underwater. The International Shark Attack File lists a single provoked attack by the <b>thresher</b> <b>shark</b> and four attacks on boats, which were probably incidental from individuals fighting capture. There is an unsubstantiated report of a common thresher acting aggressively towards a spearfisherman off New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|All three <b>thresher</b> <b>shark</b> {{species were}} reassessed from Data Deficient to Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2007. The rapid {{collapse}} of the Californian subpopulation (over 50% within three generations) prompted concerns regarding the species' susceptibility to overfishing in other areas, where fishery data is seldom reported and aspects of life history and population structure are little-known. In addition to continued fishing pressure, common threshers are also taken as bycatch in other gear such as bottom trawls and fish traps, and are considered a nuisance by mackerel fishers as they become entangled in the nets.|$|E

40|$|Interactions between pelagic <b>thresher</b> <b>sharks</b> (Alopias pelagicus) and cleaner wrasse were {{investigated}} at a seamount in the Philippines. Cleaning associations between sharks and teleosts are poorly understood, but the observable interactions seen {{at this site}} may explain why these mainly oceanic sharks regularly venture into shallow coastal waters where they are vulnerable to disturbance from human activity. From 1, 230 hours of observations recorded by remote video camera between July 2005 and December 2009, 97 cleaner-thresher shark events were analyzed, 19 of which were interrupted. Observations of pelagic <b>thresher</b> <b>sharks</b> interacting with cleaners at the seamount were recorded at all times of day but their frequency declined gradually from morning until evening.

5|$|Gimsa et al. (2015) {{suggest that}} the dorsal sail of Spinosaurus was {{homologous}} to the dorsal fins of sailfish and served a hydrodynamic purpose. Gimsa and others point out that more basal, long-legged spinosaurids have otherwise round or crescent-shaped dorsal sails, whereas in Spinosaurus, the dorsal neural spines form a shape that is roughly rectangular and similar in shape to the dorsal fins of sailfish. They therefore argue that Spinosaurus used its dorsal neural sail {{in the same manner}} as sailfish, and that it also employed its long narrow tail to stun prey like a modern <b>thresher</b> <b>shark.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite its size, {{the common}} {{thresher}} is minimally dangerous to humans {{due to its}} relatively small teeth and timid disposition. It is highly valued by commercial fishers for its meat, fins, hide, and liver oil; large numbers are taken by longline and gillnet fisheries throughout its range. This shark is also esteemed by recreational anglers for the exceptional fight it offers on hook-and-line. The common thresher has a low rate of reproduction and cannot withstand heavy fishing pressure for long, {{a case in point}} being the rapid collapse of the <b>thresher</b> <b>shark</b> fishery off California in the 1980s. With commercial exploitation increasing {{in many parts of the}} world, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E

25|$|The {{appearance}} of the megamouth is distinctive, but little else is known about it. It has a brownish-black colour on top, is white underneath, and has an asymmetrical tail with a long upper lobe, {{similar to that of}} the <b>thresher</b> <b>shark.</b> The interior of its gill slits are lined with finger-like gill rakers that capture its food. A relatively poor swimmer, the megamouth has a soft, flabby body and lacks caudal keels. The megamouth is considerably less active than the other filter-feeding sharks, the basking shark and the whale shark. The megamouth has a stout body and a long, wide bulbous head.|$|E
500|$|There are {{numerous}} accounts of common threshers using the long upper lobes of their tail fins to stun prey, {{and they are}} often snagged on longlines by their tails after presumably striking at the bait. In July 1914, shark-watcher Russell J. Coles reported seeing a <b>thresher</b> <b>shark</b> use its tail to flip prey fish into its mouth, and that one fish that missed was thrown a [...] "considerable distance". On April 14, 1923, noted oceanographer W.E. Allen observed a [...] <b>thresher</b> <b>shark</b> pursuing a California smelt (Atherinopsis californiensis) off a pier at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The shark overtook the small fish and swung its tail above the water like a [...] "coachwhip" [...] with [...] "confusing speed", severely injuring its target. In the winter of 1865, Irish ichthyologist Harry Blake-Knox claimed to have seen a <b>thresher</b> <b>shark</b> in Dublin Bay use its tail to strike a wounded loon (probably a great northern diver, Gavia immer), which it then swallowed. Blake-Knox's account was subsequently disputed by other authorities, who asserted that the thresher's tail is not rigid or muscular enough to effect such a blow.|$|E
500|$|The common {{thresher}} (Alopias vulpinus), {{also known}} by many {{names such as}} Atlantic thresher, big-eye thresher, fox shark, green thresher, swingletail, slasher, swiveltail, thintail thresher, whip-tailed shark and Zorro <b>thresher</b> <b>shark,</b> is the largest species of <b>thresher</b> <b>shark,</b> family Alopiidae, reaching some [...] in length. About half of its length consists of the elongated upper lobe of its caudal fin. With a streamlined body, short pointed snout, and modestly sized eyes, the common thresher resembles (and has often been confused with) the pelagic thresher (A. pelagicus). It can be distinguished from the latter species by the white of its belly extending in a band over the bases of its pectoral fins. The common thresher is distributed worldwide in tropical and temperate waters, though it prefers cooler temperatures. It can be found both close to shore and in the open ocean, from the surface {{to a depth of}} [...] It is seasonally migratory and spends summers at lower latitudes.|$|E

500|$|An oft-repeated myth {{about the}} common {{thresher}} {{is that they}} cooperate with swordfish to attack whales. In one version of events, the <b>thresher</b> <b>shark</b> circles the whale and distracts it by beating the sea to a froth with its tail, thereby allowing the swordfish to impale it in a vulnerable spot with its rostrum. In an alternate account, the swordfish positions itself beneath the whale, while the thresher leaps {{out of the water}} and lands on top of the whale, hammering it onto the swordfish's rostrum. Yet other authors describe the thresher [...] "cutting huge gashes" [...] in the side of the whale with its tail. Neither threshers nor swordfish however are known to feed on whales or indeed possess the dentition to do so. The story may have arisen from mariners mistaking the tall dorsal fins of killer whales, which do attack large cetaceans, for <b>thresher</b> <b>shark</b> tails. Swordfish bills have also been found embedded in blue and fin whales (likely accidents due to the fast-moving fish's inertia), and thresher sharks do exhibit some of the aforementioned behaviors independent of whales.|$|E
500|$|Famed big-game angler Frank Mundus, in {{his book}} Sportsfishing for Sharks, recounted a tale in which a {{longline}} fisherman off the Carolinas leaned {{over the side of}} his boat to examine something large that he had hooked, and was decapitated by the caudal fin of a <b>thresher</b> <b>shark</b> estimated to be [...] long. The head supposedly fell into the water and was never recovered. This account is considered highly improbable by most authors.|$|E
500|$|Most {{sharks are}} [...] "cold-blooded" [...] or, more precisely, poikilothermic, meaning that their {{internal}} body temperature matches {{that of their}} ambient environment. Members of the family Lamnidae (such as the shortfin mako shark and the great white shark) are homeothermic and maintain a higher body temperature than the surrounding water. In these sharks, a strip of aerobic red muscle located {{near the center of}} the body generates the heat, which the body retains via a countercurrent exchange mechanism by a system of blood vessels called the rete mirabile ("miraculous net"). The common <b>thresher</b> <b>shark</b> has a similar mechanism for maintaining an elevated body temperature, which is thought to have evolved independently.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} Ticao Pass, {{the waters of}} the Burias Pass are {{proposed}} to become a Marine Protected Area.

Species found there include whale <b>sharks,</b> <b>thresher</b> <b>sharks,</b> hammerhead sharks, tiger sharks, manta rays, dugong, various species of sea turtles, coral reefs, and the globally rare megamouth shark, but the pass also suffers from massive overfishing and poaching, as well as destructive blast fishing.|$|R
50|$|After being shuffled {{between the}} genera Carcharias and Odontaspis {{in the family}} Odontaspididae by various authors, in 1973 Leonard Compagno resurrected Jean Cadenat's 1963 {{subgenus}} Pseudocarcharias from synonymy for this species and placed it within its own family. The morphology of the crocodile shark suggests affinity with the megamouth shark (Megachasmidae), basking <b>shark</b> (Cetorhinidae), <b>thresher</b> <b>sharks</b> (Alopiidae), and mackerel sharks (Lamnidae). More recent phylogenetic analyses, based on mitochondrial DNA, {{have suggested that the}} crocodile shark is closely related to either the megamouth shark or the sand sharks (Odontaspididae). Alternately, analysis based on dentition suggests that the closest relatives of the crocodile <b>shark</b> are the <b>thresher</b> <b>sharks,</b> followed by the mackerel sharks. Fossil Pseudocarcharias teeth dating to the Serravallian age (13.6 - 11.6 Ma) of the Miocene epoch have been found in Italy, and are identical to those of the modern-day crocodile shark.|$|R

500|$|In 1976, the {{commercial}} gillnet fishery for the California halibut (Paralichthys californicus), operating off Santa Barbara, {{expanded to include}} the Pacific angelshark as well. The sharks had become valuable due to their promotion {{as a substitute for}} the seasonally available common <b>thresher</b> <b>shark</b> (Alopias vulpinus), and the development of new processing techniques. Around 50% of the shark was used, while the skin, cartilage, and offal were discarded. In the 1980s, rising demand led to the introduction of gillnets with a medium-sized mesh, designed specifically for this species. Fishery landings increased from a dressed (post-processing) weight of [...] in 1977, to [...] in 1983, to [...] in 1984. The fishery peaked in 1985 and 1986, when 550,000kg (1.2millionlbs) were taken annually, making this species the number one shark fished off California.
