25|$|<b>Teleprinters</b> {{were invented}} {{in order to}} send and receive {{messages}} {{without the need for}} operators trained in the use of Morse code. A system of two <b>teleprinters,</b> with one operator trained to use a typewriter, replaced two trained Morse code operators. The teleprinter system improved message speed and delivery time, making it possible for messages to be flashed across a country with little manual intervention.|$|E
25|$|The {{transmission}} speed is {{a characteristic of}} the teleprinter while the shift (the difference between the tones representing mark and space) is a characteristic of the modem. These two parameters are therefore independent, provided they have satisfied the minimum shift size for a given {{transmission speed}}. Electronic <b>teleprinters</b> can readily operate {{in a variety of}} speeds, but mechanical <b>teleprinters</b> require the change of gears in order to operate at different speeds.|$|E

25|$|Radioteletype (RTTY) is a {{telecommunications}} system consisting originally {{of two or}} more electromechanical <b>teleprinters</b> in different locations connected by radio rather than a wired link. These machines were superseded by personal computers (PCs) running software to emulate <b>teleprinters.</b> Radioteletype evolved from earlier landline teleprinter operations that began in the mid-1800s. The US Navy Department successfully tested printing telegraphy between an airplane and ground radio station in 1922. Later that year, the Radio Corporation of America successfully tested printing telegraphy via their Chatham, Massachusetts, radio station to the R.M.S. Majestic. Commercial RTTY systems were in active service between San Francisco and Honolulu as early as April 1932 and between San Francisco and New York City by 1934. The US military used radioteletype in the 1930s and expanded this usage during World War II. From the 1980s, <b>teleprinters</b> were replaced by computers running teleprinter emulation software.|$|E
25|$|One highly {{significant}} application was the Sabre airline reservations system, which first went into operation in 1960. With Sabre reservations {{could be placed}} remotely using <b>teleprinters</b> and all functions were done automatically, including ticket printing. This eliminated manually handling file cards.|$|E
25|$|The Staten Island {{volunteer}} {{companies are}} dispatched by the Staten Island Communications Office and {{operate on the}} FDNY Staten Island frequency. Broad Channel and West Hamilton Beach have <b>teleprinters</b> in parallel with the FDNY fire companies that also serve their area. The Brooklyn and first four volunteer companies in Queens also provide ambulance services.|$|E
50|$|The {{command-line}} interface {{evolved from}} a form of dialog once conducted by humans over <b>teleprinter</b> (TTY) machines, in which human operators remotely exchanged information, usually one line of text at a time. Early computer systems often used <b>teleprinter</b> machines as the means of interaction with a human operator. The computer became {{one end of the}} human-to-human <b>teleprinter</b> model. So instead of a human communicating with another human over a <b>teleprinter,</b> a human communicated with a computer.|$|R
2500|$|... 1914: AP {{introduced}} the <b>teleprinter,</b> which transmitted directly to printers over telegraph wires. Eventually a worldwide network of 60-word-per-minute <b>teleprinter</b> machines is built.|$|R
5000|$|Kleinschmidt machines, {{with the}} {{military}} as their primary customer, used standard military designations for their machines. The <b>teleprinter</b> was identified with designations such as a TT-4/FG, while communication [...] "sets" [...] to which a <b>teleprinter</b> might be a part generally used the standard Army/Navy designation system such as AN/FGC-25. This includes Kleinschmidt <b>teleprinter</b> TT-117/FG and tape reperforator TT-179/FG.|$|R
25|$|A {{telegraph}} message sent by {{an electrical}} telegraph operator or telegrapher using Morse code (or a printing telegraph operator using plain text) {{was known as}} a telegram. A cablegram was a message sent by a submarine telegraph cable, often shortened to a cable or a wire. Later, a Telex was a message sent by a Telex network, a switched network of <b>teleprinters</b> similar to a telephone network.|$|E
25|$|Electromechanical <b>teleprinters</b> were heavy, {{complex and}} noisy, {{and have been}} {{replaced}} with electronic units. The teleprinter includes a keyboard, which is the main means of entering text, and a printer or visual display unit (VDU). An alternative input device is a perforated tape reader and, more recently, computer storage media (such as floppy disks). Alternative output devices are tape perforators and computer storage media.|$|E
25|$|Long-running {{regional}} affairs program The Country Hour {{began in}} December, 1945. The ABC's coverage of rural affairs was significantly {{enhanced by the}} deployment of journalists and 'extension officers' to major country areas. The increasing availability of landlines and <b>teleprinters</b> allowed the organisation to gather and broadcast news and other program material with much greater efficiency {{than in the previous}} two decades. By this time, as many as 13 national news bulletins were broadcast daily.|$|E
5000|$|The Colossus {{computers}} {{were used to}} help decipher intercepted radio <b>teleprinter</b> messages that had been encrypted using an unknown device. Intelligence information revealed that the Germans called the wireless <b>teleprinter</b> transmission systems [...] "SÃ¤gefisch" [...] (sawfish). This led the British to call encrypted German <b>teleprinter</b> traffic [...] "Fish", and the unknown machine and its intercepted messages [...] "Tunny" [...] (tunafish).|$|R

25|$|The 5 {{data bits}} allow for only 32 {{different}} codes, which cannot accommodate the 26 letters, 10 figures, space, a few punctuation marks and the required control codes, such as carriage return, new line, bell, etc. To overcome this limitation, the teleprinter has two states, the unshifted or letters {{state and the}} shifted or numbers or figures state. The change from one state to the other takes place when the special control codes LETTERS and FIGURES are sent from the keyboard or received from the line. In the letters state the teleprinter prints the letters and space while in the shifted state it prints the numerals and punctuation marks. <b>Teleprinters</b> for languages using other alphabets also use an additional third shift state, in which they print letters in the alternative alphabet.|$|E
25|$|On January 7, 1972, the FCC amended Part 97 {{to allow}} faster RTTY speeds. Four {{standard}} RTTY speeds were authorized, namely, 60 (45 baud), 67 (50 baud), 75 (56.25 baud) and 100 (75 baud) words per minute. Many Amateur Radio operators had equipment that {{was capable of}} being upgraded to 75 and 100 words per minute by changing teleprinter gears. While there was an initial interest in 100 words per minute operation, many Amateur Radio operators moved back to 60 words per minute. Some {{of the reasons for}} the failure of 100 words per minute HF RTTY included poor operation of improperly maintained mechanical <b>teleprinters,</b> narrow bandwidth terminal units, continued use of 170Hz shift at 100 words per minute and excessive error rates due to multipath distortion and the nature of ionospheric propagation.|$|E
25|$|When a key of the {{teleprinter}} keyboard is pressed, a 5-bit {{character is}} generated. The teleprinter converts it to serial format and transmits {{a sequence of}} a start bit (a logical 0 or space), then {{one after the other}} the 5 data bits, finishing with a stop bit (a logical 1 or mark, lasting 1, 1.5 or 2 bits). When a sequence of start bit, 5 data bits and stop bit arrives at the input of the teleprinter, it is converted to a 5-bit word and passed to the printer or VDU. With electromechanical <b>teleprinters,</b> these functions required complicated electromechanical devices, but they are easily implemented with standard digital electronics using shift registers. Special integrated circuits have been developed for this function, for example the Intersil 6402 and 6403. These are stand-alone UART devices, similar to computer serial port peripherals.|$|E
50|$|In 1924 Creed {{entered the}} <b>teleprinter</b> field with their Model 1P, which was soon {{superseded}} by the improved Model 2P. In 1925 Creed acquired the patents for Donald Murray's Murray code, a rationalised Baudot code, {{and it was}} used for their new Model 3 Tape <b>Teleprinter</b> of 1927. This machine printed received messages directly onto gummed paper tape {{at a rate of}} 65 words per minute and was the first combined start-stop transmitter-receiver <b>teleprinter</b> from Creed to enter mass production.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1930s, {{landline}} <b>teleprinter</b> {{operation was}} adapted for radio use (radioteletype or [...] "RTTY") which allowed for faster, more efficient messaging. This did not replace Morse code entirely, because many vessels had no <b>teleprinter</b> equipment and because Morse {{was the most}} reliable transmission mode available: when faced with bad atmospheric conditions and weak signals, dots and dashes are easier to pick up than <b>teleprinter</b> or the human voice, and all the coding and decoding are done in the brain.|$|R
50|$|The {{differencing}} calculator with recording (German:Differenzen Rechengereat, English:Differencing Calculating Apparatus) was {{a machine}} designed to compute a flag of difference {{for a set}} of enciphered code groups and record it. it consisted of two <b>teleprinter</b> tapes with photoelectric reading heads, a set of calculating relays and an recording electric <b>teleprinter.</b> The read heads operated at 7 characters a second, bounded by the speed of the <b>teleprinter</b> where time was lost by the carriage return and line feed. It cost ââ³920 Reichsmarks, $800.00 at 1945 conversion rates.|$|R
25|$|In 1980, the Authority {{standardised}} the Urdu {{keyboard layout}} for typewriters based on Naskh script. Later on, {{with the arrival}} of the digital age, the layout was improved for <b>teleprinters</b> and Information processing. Subsequently, in 1998 efforts were initiated to standardize Urdu encoding, which resulted in the formation of Urdu Zabta Takhti (Ø§Ø±Ø¯Ù Ø¶Ø§Ø¨Ø·Û ØªØ®ØªÛ) (UZT). This development was inline with the efforts to cope with the emerging demands of Urdu applications from word processing to mega-scale projects such as Computerised National Identity Cards by NADRA and a number of E-Governance initiatives by the national government. In July 2000, UZT 1.01 was standardised for all kinds of electronic computing, communications, and storage. Based on this version, Urdu language support was incorporated into the Versions 3.1 and 4.0 of Unicode. Localization of Microsoft applications like Windows and Office in Urdu is also done by then NLA, now NLPD.|$|E
500|$|The Weather Bureau in New Orleans, Louisiana issued {{small craft}} {{warnings}} at 1230 UTC on July 24 stretching from Port O'Connor to High Island, Texas, while [...] "whole gale warnings" [...] were posted from Port O'Connor to Matagorda, Texas with regular gale warnings extending north to Freeport, Texas at 1500 UTC. A hurricane warning was later declared for areas between Matagorda to High Island at 2130 UTC, {{which was published}} at 2200 UTC. Warnings were widely distributed through radio services (including KGBC, KILE, KTLW, WBRZ, and KIOX), newspapers, bulletin boards, telegraph via the Western Union, regional <b>teleprinters,</b> the Chamber of Commerce's storm board, and storm warning displays. Several thousand citizens sought shelter at public facilities, including schools and courthouses. Approximately 1,000 inhabitants of Surfside Beach evacuated amid the threat of Debra. Between two and three thousand fled to Angleton, and another 1,000 fled to Freeport. An estimate said that at least 2,500people left the Galveston Bay area; another 1,100stayed in the Brazoria County Courthouse and 1,000residents took shelter in public buildings in Galveston. Numerous others moved from resort towns into other areas.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Teleprinters</b> {{appeared}} in 1910 and had replaced between 80 and 90% of Morse code operators by 1929. [...] It {{is estimated that}} one teletypist replaced 15 Morse code operators.|$|E
2500|$|While {{typewriters}} are {{the definitive}} ancestor of all key-based [...] text entry devices, the computer keyboard as a device for electromechanical data entry and communication derives {{largely from the}} utility of two devices: <b>teleprinters</b> (or teletypes) and keypunches. It was through such devices that modern computer keyboards inherited their layouts.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the second}} {{generation}} remote terminal units (often {{in the form of}} <b>Teleprinters</b> like a Friden Flexowriter) saw greatly increased use. [...] Telephone connections provided sufficient speed for early remote terminals and allowed hundreds of kilometers separation between remote-terminals and the computing center. Eventually these stand-alone computer networks would be generalized into an interconnected network of networksâthe Internet.|$|E
