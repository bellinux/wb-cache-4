50|$|The wing {{structure}} {{was formed by}} three built-up girder spars of triangular section with aluminium wing ribs spaced fairly wide apart; the wing fabric was sewn to special eyelets, which were attached to the framework at evenly spaced intervals. The lower wings were attached directly to the fuselage, touching the water when afloat, improving water-borne stability. The low aspect ratio upper wing {{was supported by a}} central frame work and N <b>strut</b> <b>assemblies</b> at 1/3rd span and 2/3rd span. Incidence of the upper wing was adjustable by altering the length of the forward N-strut tubes.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{conventional}} aircraft, the HM.14 has no ailerons or elevators, and no foot-operated {{flight control}}s. The {{flight control system}} comprises a conventional control stick. Fore-and-aft movement of the stick is transmitted via cables to the rear underside of the main wing, that {{is supported by a}} single pivot at the front underside, mounted on a pylon on the fuselage. Rearward movement of the stick pulls the cables, and increases the pitch and therefore the lift of the main wing. The aircraft will then pitch up, due to the centre of pressure being forward of the center of gravity. Forward stick movement has the reverse effect. Resistance to stick movement is usually an aerodynamic force from the main wing, {{but there is also a}} rubber spring (bungee) pulling down on the leading edge of the wing, and a <b>telescopic</b> <b>strut</b> behind the pilot's head limits the total wing movement. Side-to-side movement of the stick controls the all-moving rudder via cables. In flight, this produces a stable rolling motion, as required in a banked turn, because the wings both have dihedral. That rolling characteristic is not safely available during take-off or landing, so crosswinds are not easily tolerated.|$|R

40|$|Classical {{flexible}} structures {{dynamics and}} control suffer from several major deficiencies. First, reliable mathematical models involve partial differential equations which {{are difficult to}} deal with analytically as well as numerically. A partial differential equations mathematical model of a system 2 ̆ 7 s dynamics is not practical for control system design, since most of the modern control systems design methodologies assume a state space representation. Second, from a practical perspective, the control of classical truss structures involves the use of expensive and short life mechanisms like <b>telescopic</b> <b>struts.</b> Third, the control of classical truss structures involves high energy, massive, hydraulic actuators. Fourth, classical controllable structures have many, complicated, bar to bar joints, which make the control task difficult. ^ This thesis proposes a class of lightweight, space structures, called tensegrity structures, which can be reliably modeled using ordinary differential equations. Tensegrity structures offer excellent opportunities for physically integrated structure and control system design since their members can serve simultaneously as sensors, actuators, and load carrying elements. The actuating functions can be carried by tendons, controlled by electric motors. Thus, <b>telescopic</b> <b>struts</b> and hydraulic actuators can be eliminated. Additionally, tensegrity structures can be built without any bar to bar connections. ^ The general prestressability conditions for tensegrity structures are derived from the principle of virtual work. In several cases these conditions are analytically solved, allowing for the parameterization of certain classes of prestressable configurations. A general methodology for the investigation of the prestressability conditions is also developed. The methodology uses symbolic and numeric computation, and it is meant to significantly reduce the complexity of the prestressability conditions for certain prestressable configurations. ^ Mathematical models for tensegrity structures dynamics are developed using the Lagrangian approach. For certain classes of structures, particular motions are investigated and simpler dynamic equations are derived. These equations are next used for a simple, efficient, tendon control reconfiguration procedure. For certain classes of tensegrity structures linear parametric dynamical models are also developed. ^ A tendon control deployment procedure for tensegrity structures is developed. The procedure is time optimal and uses continuous time control laws. It is based on the discovery of a connected equilibrium manifold to which the deployed and undeployed configurations belong. The deployment is conducted such that, in the state space, the deployment path is close enough to the equilibrium manifold. ^ A force and torque sensor based on a tensegrity structure is proposed, enabling the simultaneous measurement of six quantities, three orthogonal forces and three orthogonal moments. An optimal estimator is designed, based on the linearized model of the structure. ^ Finally, a motion simulator which exploits the intrinsic advantages of a tensegrity structure, is proposed. The actuating functions are carried out by the tendons, eliminating the telescopic actuators. A nonlinear robust tracking controller is designed to assure exponential convergence of the tracking error to a ball of prespecified radius, with a prespecified rate of convergence. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} study, {{using the}} INS 3 D flow solver, of laminar and turbulent flow around a two dimensional strut, and three dimensional flow around a strut in an annulus is presented. A multi-block procedure {{was used to}} calculate two dimensional laminar flow around two struts in parallel, with each strut represented by one computational block.

5000|$|The car {{featured}} a short-long arm (SLA) four-wheel independent suspension, with a modified MacPherson <b>strut</b> <b>assembly</b> in front, that offered excellent handling and ride quality. This setup was significant as {{it made the}} Thunderbird and the Cougar the only rear-wheel drive North American domestic cars other than the Chevrolet Corvette to offer a four-wheel independent suspension at the time. Engine options fell to only two for 1989 as Ford dropped the V8 option for the new Thunderbird. The base and LX models were powered by Ford's 3.8 L Essex OHV V6. Producing [...] at 3800 rpm and 215 lbft Nm of torque at 2400 rpm, many felt the engine was somewhat underpowered for a car that weighed over 3500 lb in base trim (heavier when equipped with available options). This engine was mated to Ford's AOD 4-speed automatic transmission regardless of trim level from the 1989 to 1993 model years. Thanks in part to its low coefficient of drag, the Thunderbird was relatively fuel efficient considering its overall size and weight. The EPA gave 1989 Thunderbirds equipped with the standard V6 a fuel efficiency rating of 19 mpg in city driving and 27 mpg on the highway, though, like most cars built before 2008, this rating was retroactively reduced by the EPA to reflect newer, more realistic fuel efficiency measurements. The fuel efficiency rating was noticeably better than that of Thunderbirds equipped with higher performance engines and gave the base V6-equipped Thunderbird a significant driving range with its 19 gallon fuel tank (later decreased to 18 gallons).|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{environmental}} and health concerns with Electroplated Hard Chrome (EHC), the Hard Chrome Alternatives Team (HCAT) has been working to provide an alternative wear coating for EHC. The US Navy selected Tungsten-Carbide Cobalt (WC- 17 Co) High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) thermal spray coating for this purpose and completed service evaluations on select aircraft components to support the HCAT charter in identifying an alternative wear coating for chrome plating. Other benefits of WC-Co thermal spray coatings over EHC are enhanced corrosion resistance, improved durability, and exceptional wear properties. As part of the HCAT charter and to evaluate HVOF coatings on operational Navy components, the P- 3 aircraft was selected for a service evaluation to determine the coating durability as compared to chrome plating. In April 1999, a VP- 30 P- 3 aircraft was outfitted with a right-hand Main Landing Gear (MLG) shock strut coated with WCCo HYOF thermal spray applied to the piston barrel and four axle journals. The HVOF coating on the piston barrel and axle journals was applied by Southwest United Industries, Inc. This HVOF coated <b>strut</b> <b>assembly</b> has since completed 6, 378 landings.

5000|$|The Ju 288's {{intricate}} main {{landing gear}} system's design proved to be troublesome, possessing twin vertical members directly behind a single oleo strut, for each pair of twinned wheels mounted to {{the lower end of}} the uniquely-attached main oleo strut unit. This single-tube oleo strut was pivoted off {{the lower end of the}} twin-member, [...] "Y-shaped" [...] retraction <b>strut</b> <b>assembly,</b> and was rotated in the vertical plane about this single attachment in a rearwards direction during retraction of the maingear unit, separate from the twin-member unit to help [...] "shorten" [...] its stowed length within the engine nacelle. This distinctive type of design required the oleo strut's freely-moving top end to physically rotate downwards and aftwards during the rear-swinging retraction of the main [...] "Y-shaped" [...] member, operated by a lever and gear-sector system mounted on the portside of each main gear assembly, operated with a long lever that had its upper end anchored to the firewall's rear surface. [...] The lever/sector gear system swiveled the oleo strut about its attachment point during the retract cycle, through an arc of roughly 180º from its position when the main gear was fully extended. The stowed position of the oleo strut ended up orienting it aftwards within the rear of the engine nacelle, and placing the wheels' axle location just ahead of and above the oleo strut's pivot point when fully retracted. Such a complex main gear design, with only the single pivoting retraction point for its oleo struts taking the primary stress of touchdown, was likely only one of the many potential sources of trouble causing the Ju 288's main gear units to repeatedly collapse on touchdown.|$|R

It was continually noted in reports that her operation was more like that of an airplane than a ship, particularly her wiring systems which were similar to the wiring used in aircraft.

5000|$|Because {{the upper}} wing tilted, {{it had to}} be a {{cantilever}} structure. It was built around two wooden spars and was mounted at its centre on a chordwise circular cross-section rod, fixed to the fuselage, which acted as a hinge and allowed the wing to see-saw. When the Jona J-6 appeared at the Milan show in 1935, the year before its first flight, this hinge was held above the fuselage on a faired column, but before it flew this was replaced by four pairs of faired V-form struts with their eight ends fixed to it. [...] Control wires from the ailerons were attached to the fixed hinge rod, providing the required automatic deflections as the wing tilted. The rate of tilt was limited by a pair of <b>telescopic,</b> sprung <b>struts</b> from mid-chord quite close to the centreline, which met at the bottom centre of the fuselage after passing in through the upper sides. These could be hydraulically locked for aerobatics and spins or when stabilisation was not wanted. Leading edge automatic Handley Page slots were fitted to prevent spinning via wingtip stalling. The wing was plywood-covered and straight-tapered in plan form, with semi-elliptical tips. The lower wing was generally similar, though much smaller and rigidly mounted. Though not required when the automatic lateral control system was engaged, conventional, pilot operated ailerons were later added to the lower wing.|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} geometry {{was developed}} {{from that of}} the Ford P5 and again incorporated MacPherson <b>struts.</b> <b>Telescopic</b> dampers also improved the suspension of the wheels {{at the back of the}} car where the steel beam axle and the semielliptical leaf springs would have been familiar to drivers of earlier Taunus models. The rear suspension setup was by now seen as rather outclassed in comparison with traditional rivals from Opel, and tended to undermine any aspirations for the 26M version of the relatively lowly 17M/20M to compete in a higher class than the earlier 17M had attempted. The antiquated rear axle would be replaced by a more up-to-date semitrailing arm arrangement on the successor model, but Ford nevertheless remained curiously attached to the old combination of a rigid rear axle and leaf springs, and by now. uniquely among Germany’s mainstream sutomakers, were still selling this rear-axle configuration to buyers of the Ford Capri until 1984.|$|R
5000|$|Work on the Ju 287 programme, {{along with}} all other pending German bomber {{projects}} (including Junkers' other ongoing heavy bomber design, the piston-engined Ju 488) {{came to a halt}} in July 1944, but Junkers was allowed to go forward with the flight testing regime on the V1 prototype. The wing section for the V2 had been completed by that time. Seventeen test flights were undertaken in total, which passed without notable incident. Minor problems, however, did arise with the turbojet engines and the RATO booster units, which proved to be unreliable over sustained periods. This initial test phase was designed purely to assess the low-speed handling qualities of the forward-swept wing, but despite this the V1 was dived at full jet power on at least one occasion, attaining a speed in the medium dive-angle employed of 660kph. To gain data on airflow patterns, small woolen tufts were glued to the airframe and the [...] "behavior" [...] of these tufts during flight was captured by a cine camera mounted on a sturdy tripod directly ahead of the plane's tailfin. After the seventeenth and last flight in late autumn of 1944, the V1 was placed in storage and the Ju 287 programme came to what was then believed to be its end. However, in March 1945, for reasons that are not entirely clear, the 287 programme was restarted, with the RLM issuing a requirement for mass production of the jet bomber (100 airframes a month) as soon as possible. The V1 prototype was taken out of storage and transferred to the Luftwaffe evaluation centre at Rechlin, but was destroyed in an Allied bombing raid before it could take to the air again. Construction on the V2 and V3 prototypes was resumed at the Junkers factory near Leipzig, and intended future variant designs (meant for service in 1946) were dusted off. These included the Ju 287B-1, seeing a return to the original powerplant choice of four 1300 kg thrust HeS 011 turbojets; and the B-2, which was to have employed two 3500 kg thrust BMW 018 turbojets. While the Heinkel turbojet was in the pre-production phase at war's end, work on BMW's radical and massively powerful turbine engine never proceeded past three barely-tested prototypes. The final Ju 287 variant design to be mooted was a Mistel combination-plane ground attack version, comprising an unmanned explosives-packed [...] "drone" [...] 287 and a manned Me 262 fighter attached {{to the top of the}} bomber by a <b>strut</b> <b>assembly.</b> The cockpit of the 287 would be replaced by a massive impact-fused warhead. Takeoff and flight control of the combination would be under the direction of the 262's pilot.

40|$|Propulsion, energy collection, {{communication}} or habitation {{in space}} requires ever larger space structures for {{the exploration of}} our solar system and beyond. Due to the payload size restrictions of the current launch vehicles, deployable structures are the way to go to launch very large structures into orbit. This paper therefore presents the design and simulation of a tensegrity based structure with inflatable rigidizable tubes as compression struts. The literature review showed that inflatable structures are most promising for the development of deployable reflectors larger than twenty meters in diameter. Good compression performance and reliability can be achieved by employing rigidisable inflatable tubes. The concept presented in this paper will focus on the development and simulation of a one meter diameter hexagonal reflector substructure that can be easily expanded to larger diameters due to its modular design. The one meter diameter modular approach was chosen to be able to build a full size benchmark model to validate the numerical data in the future. Due {{to the fact that the}} tensegrity compression elements are not initiating at one specific location, a passive reaction gas inflation technique is proposed which makes the structure independent of any pumps or other active inflation devices. This paper will discuss the use of inflatable rigidizable elements and their counteraction with the rest of the tensegrity structure. Simulations have been undertaken to capture the deployment behaviour of the inflating tube while getting perturbated by the attached tensegrity tension cables. These simulations showed that the use of inflatable rigidisable <b>struts</b> in tensegrity <b>assemblies</b> can greatly decrease the system mass and stowed volume, especially for very large reflectors compared to conventional approaches...|$|R
