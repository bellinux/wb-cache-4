5|$|The {{origin of}} the name St Kilda {{is a matter of}} conjecture. The islands' human {{heritage}} includes numerous unique architectural features from the historic and prehistoric periods, although the earliest written records of island life date from the Late Middle Ages. The medieval village on Hirta was rebuilt in the 19th century, but illnesses brought by increased external contacts through tourism, and the upheaval of the First World War contributed to the island's evacuation in 1930. The story of St Kilda has attracted artistic interpretations, including Michael Powell's film <b>The</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> and an opera.|$|E
5|$|After {{breaking}} {{out from his}} prison, Brad falls into a moat before coming {{to a halt in}} a maze of an underground cavern. Reaching the surface, he arrives at a nearby village; this location is repeatedly revisited throughout the game, as Brad comes back there after traveling to the various corners of the land, encountering bizarre characters and experiencing absurd adventures: <b>the</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> cliff, the Ice Palace, and the Valley of the Lost (a place where all kinds of things lost on Earth have gone to), all while searching for an unlikely set of items that would help him emerge victorious from the game's final showdown (including a fire extinguisher and a mechanical fan). In the end, the boy enters the evil Queen's castle to find and defeat her once and for all. Once she is no more, he gets instantly transported back to the baseball field where it all had started.|$|E
5|$|Lady Crane {{returns to}} her {{chambers}} to find a wounded Arya Stark hiding inside, and helps stitch her wounds. She tells Arya that thanks to her warning, she mutilated her would-be killer Bianca's face before kicking {{her out of the}} acting company. She then offers to have Arya join them, but she refuses, saying that she intends to travel west of Westeros to see <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> As Arya recovers, The Waif arrives and kills Lady Crane, intending to kill Arya as well. Arya flees through the streets of Braavos, but during the chase, Arya's wounds reopen and she limps back to her hideout with the Waif in close pursuit. As the Waif closes in, Arya uses Needle to cut a candle, plunging the room into total darkness, where, having been trained while blinded for several weeks, Arya gains the upper hand.|$|E

The Lair of Typhon, hidden in an unknown location, is a snow-topped mountain and prison of the Titans Typhon and Prometheus. The Island of Creation is a vast island located at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and home to the Sisters of Fate. The island is host to deadly traps, puzzles, and monsters. On {{the outskirts of the}} island are the Steeds of Time, and on the island itself are the Temples of Lakhesis and Atropos, and the Bog of the Forgotten, which hides the Gorgon Euryale and is the site of Jason of the Argonauts' last battle. Beyond the Bog are the Lowlands and the Great Chasm: a huge divide that blocks the way to the Palace of the Fates. At the base of the Chasm is the realm of Tartarus—prison of the Titan Atlas, condemned to hold the world on his shoulders. The Temple of the Fates is also filled with traps and monsters, while the final battle occurs on Mount Olympus, home to the gods.|$|E

St Kilda lies in the Atlantic Ocean, [...] west of the Outer Hebrides but Powell was unable to get permission to film there. Undaunted, he made the film over four months during the summer of 1936 on Foula and the film transposes these events to Shetland. Forty years later, the documentary Return to <b>the</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> was filmed, capturing a reunion of cast and crew of the film as they revisited the island in 1978.|$|E

Manny learns from Olivia Ofrenda that Don has been [...] "sprouted" [...] for letting the scandal be known and that Meche was recently seen with Domino leaving the port. Manny gives chase and a year later tracks them to a coral mining plant on <b>the</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World.</b> Domino has been holding Meche there as a trap to lure Manny. All of Domino's clients who had their tickets stolen are also being held there and used as slave labor, both to make a profit with the coral mining and as a way to keep Hector's scandal quiet. Domino tries to convince Manny to take over his position in the plant seeing as he has no alternative and can spend the rest of eternity with Meche but he refuses.

500|$|The {{steamship}} company running a service between Glasgow and St Kilda commissioned a short (18-minute) silent movie, St Kilda, Britain's Loneliest Isle. Released in 1928, it shows some {{scenes in the}} lives of the island’s inhabitants. In 1937, after reading of the St Kilda evacuation, Michael Powell made the film <b>The</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> about the dangers of island depopulation. It was shot on Foula, one of the Shetland Islands. The writer Dorothy Dunnett wrote a short story, [...] "The Proving Climb", set on St Kilda; it was published in 1973 in the anthology Scottish Short Stories.|$|E
500|$|The stoor worm {{is likely}} to be an Orkney variant of the Norse Jörmungandr, or world serpent, also known as the Midgard Serpent. The Orcadian folklorist Marwick {{highlights}} the similarity between the method Assipattle used to kill the mythical creature and those recounted in the slaying of the Worm of Linton and the Cnoc na Cnoimh of Sutherland tales. He also notes that in Bel and the Dragon, the dragon is killed by Daniel using [...] "fat and hair" [...] instead of peat. In Shetland there was a long-standing belief that [...] "away, far out to sea, near <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> lived a monstrous sea-serpent that took about six hours to draw in his breath, and six hours to let it out", which Marwick speculates was probably an explanation for the cycle of the tides.|$|E

500|$|Discworld is a third-person point-and-click graphic {{adventure}} game. An overhead map appears when {{leaving a}} location {{that allows the}} player {{to go straight to}} another. Locations featured include the Unseen University, the Broken Drum (a pub), and the Shades (where the city's [...] "exciting nightlife" [...] reside). Locations outside Ankh-Morpork include the Dark Wood (where Nanny Ogg resides), the Mines (where dwarves tune swords), and <b>the</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> (where [...] "the world ends and space begins"). Items can be examined or used, and can either be stored in Rincewind's pockets or in the Luggage. To progress in the game, Rincewind must collect items, talk to people and solve puzzles. Rincewind may also acquire special skills needed to perform certain tasks. Characters featured include an Archchancellor, the Dibbler, the Librarian, and Death. During a conversation, the player may choose to have Rincewind greet, joke with, vent anger towards, or pose a question to the character.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{took place}} at Pinewood Studios for the {{interior}} scenes of the Wyrmberg, the Octavo room in the Unseen University, and for exterior shots of Ankh-Morpork and the Broken Drum.

Background shots of Niagara Falls were also taken, and digitally merged with the bluescreen film shot at Pinewood, location shots taken on a river in Wales, and CGI sequences of A'Tuin and the Discworld. Digitally combining all this material together in a believable fashion was, according to Jean, [...] "the toughest week of the shoot". All the digital effects and CGI for the film were provided by Fluid Pictures, a small digital effects group based in Soho.|$|E
