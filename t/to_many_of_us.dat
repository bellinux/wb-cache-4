To do that, of course, we Americans will have to yield up some of our sovereignty. That would be a bitter pill. It would take a lot of courage, a lot of faith in the new order.

60|$|My friends, {{allow me}} to speak a few plain and honest words, ere we part, on a matter which is near to, and {{probably}} important <b>to,</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> here.

It is a commission which will take you a year to execute, and it will lead you into a new land. It will require tact, diplomacy and some courage.

6000|$|Yes, {{there are}} some things the {{universal}} suffrage can decide,--and about these it will be exceedingly useful to consult the universal suffrage: but in regard to most things of importance, and in regard to the choice of men especially, there is (astonishing as it may seem) next to no capability on the part of universal suffrage.--I request all candid persons, who have never so little originality of mind, and every man has a little, to consider this. If true, it involves such a change in our now fashionable modes of procedure as fills me with astonishment and alarm. If popular suffrage is not the way of ascertaining what the Laws of the Universe are, and who it is that will best guide us in the way of these,--then woe is to us if we do not take another method. Delolme on the British Constitution will not save us; deaf will the Parcae be to votes of the House, to leading articles, constitutional philosophies. The other method--alas, it involves a stopping short, or vital change of direction, in the glorious career which all Europe, with shouts heaven-high, is now galloping along: and that, happen when it may, will, <b>to</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> be probably a rather surprising business! ...|$|E
6000|$|Certainly it is {{a fearful}} business, that of having your Ableman to seek, {{and not knowing}} in what manner to proceed about it! That is the world's sad predicament in these times of ours. They are times of revolution, and have long been. The {{bricklayer}} with his bricks, no longer heedful of plummet or the law of gravitation, have toppled, tumbled, and it all welters as we see! But the beginning of {{it was not the}} French Revolution; that is rather the end, we can hope. It were truer to say, the beginning was three centuries farther back: in the Reformation of Luther. That the thing which still called itself Christian Church had become a Falsehood, and brazenly went about pretending to pardon men's sins for metallic coined money, and to do much else which in the everlasting truth of Nature it did not now do: here lay the vital malady. The inward being wrong, all outward went ever more and more wrong. Belief died away; all was Doubt, Disbelief. The builder cast away his plummet; said to himself, [...] "What is gravitation? Brick lies on brick there!" [...] Alas, does it not still sound strange <b>to</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> the assertion that there is a God's-truth in the business of god-created men; that all is not a kind of grimace, an [...] "expediency," [...] diplomacy, one knows not what--! ...|$|E

It may seem a doubtful and a hazardous thing thus to stake our future upon any one young man; but then {{we must remember that}} the choice will not be wholly or even mainly ours; we will be guided and directed as we ever are in the laying on of hands. To me, considering this matter thus, it has seemed that there is one youth in our body who is specially pointed out for this work. Only one child has ever been born into the Church: he, as you know, is the son of brother John Owen and sister Margaret Owen, who were received into the fold just six days before his birth. Paul Owen's very name seems <b>to</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> who take nothing for chance but all things for divinely ordered, to mark him out at once as a foreordained Apostle.
