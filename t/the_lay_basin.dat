50|$|In the 19th {{century the}} basin was {{inhabited}} by the Northern Paiute tribe. It was explored and extensively trapped by trappers of the Hudson's Bay Company in <b>the</b> 1820s. <b>The</b> <b>basin</b> <b>lay</b> far off <b>the</b> {{route of the}} Oregon Trail, but in 1845 experienced mountain man Stephen Meek led an ill-fated party across the basin via Stinkingwater Pass, seeking a shortcut to The Dalles along what {{has become known as}} the Meek Cutoff. A total of 23 people died while the party wandered in the basin until finding water at the Crooked River.|$|R

40|$|Abstrad: Late Cretaceous-Early Tertiary terrigenous and {{calcareous}} turbidites {{exposed in}} the Argolis Peninsula of southern Greece represent an accretionary complex assembled during {{the closure of}} a Late Cretaceous Neotethyan ocean. Massive sulphide bodies, thrust slices of cherts and serpentinized ultramafics are found imbricated within a tectonic stack of approximately 8 km thick-ness. Basalts with overlying Cenomanian-Maastrichtian pelagic limestones and metalliferous sedi-ments are found istributed throughout he complex. The basalts give trace-element chemical signatures consistent with an origin at a mid-ocean ridge or back-arc basin. Folding and shearing is locally intense in fault zones 10 - 20 m across, resulting in a block-in-matrix fabric. Metamorphism within the complex is of low-to-high diagenetic grade, with grade generally increasing structurally up-section. Palaeo-slope indicators suggest that <b>the</b> ocean <b>basin</b> <b>lay</b> to <b>the</b> present SE. The SSW to NNE emplacement is at variance with the SW-vergent Early Tertiary thrusting of the Hellenides. and may be explicable in terms of transpressional tectonics along the southeastern termination of the Pelagonian micro-continent. The processes which assembled the Ermioni Complex appear to have operated {{in a similar fashion}} to those seen along the margins of major ocean basins, although active over much shorter periods of time...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} {{time of its}} active development, from the Pennsylvanian on into the Lower Rotliegend (Glan Subgroup, Meisenheim Formation), fluviolacustrine {{sedimentation}} conditions prevailed in the Saar-Nahe <b>Basin.</b> <b>The</b> <b>basin</b> <b>lay,</b> according to palaeomagnetic investigation, {{just north of the}} equator in the tropics at this time, so that under warm and moist climatic conditions, the lacustrine deposits especially, with their heavy amounts of organic remnants, ended up forming many coal seams, especially in the Pennsylvanian. Towards the end of the Rotliegend (Disibodenberg Formation), the extensive, at times basinwide lakes were filled in by advancing deltas, {{and by the end of}} the Glan Subgroup (beginning with the Oberkirchen Formation), the predominant deposit conditions were fluvial in what were now dry-warm climatic conditions. Along with its attendant, sometimes heavy, intrusive and effusive-extrusive magmatism - involving lavas and tuffs being pushed up, their place taken by both acidic and basic intrusions - it lasted until the middle of the Nahe Subgroup, when it came to an end with the quartzite conglomerate deposition found in the Wadern Formation. Preserved today from the last phase of the Permian-Carboniferous sedimentation in the Saar-Nahe Basin are the Standenbühl Formation’s alluvial-fan and dry-lake (playa) sediments, represented by the Kreuznach Formation’s fluvial-aeolian sandstones found regionally on the basin’s northwest edge near Bad Kreuznach.|$|R
