5|$|After Mission San Fernando Rey de España was {{established}} in 1797, the administrators there realized they would need more land for agriculture and livestock, and they looked north to the Santa Clarita Valley to establish their estancia, or mission rancho. Subsequently, the Tataviam who had been living there were relocated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mission,</b> where they were baptized and put to work. The Estancia de San Francisco Xavier was built in 1804 at the confluence of Castaic Creek and the Santa Clara River.|$|E
5|$|In 1762, missionaries {{established}} two unauthorized missions {{south of}} San Sabá, in the Nueces River valley. For several years the Apache {{lived in the}} missions most of the year, but left in winter to hunt buffalo. One of the missions closed in 1763, when the Apache never returned from their hunt. The surviving mission closed in January 1766, after a force of 400natives from the northern tribes attacked, killing 6Apaches and taking 25captives {{as well as all}} the livestock in the valley. Forty-one Spanish troops and their small cannon ambushed the northern tribes as they returned to East Texas. Before the Spanish were forced to retreat, over 200Indians and 12Spanish soldiers died. After the battle, the Apache refused to return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> and returned to raiding near San Antonio. Raids by the northern tribes decreased, however.|$|E

5|$|On 23 November, Allied bombers {{attacked}} the fortress at Sattelberg, {{as well as}} defensive positions around Kumawa. The 2/48th, nearing their objective, cautiously began to probe the outer positions, while to the north, three companies from the 2/24th managed to reach the saddle that lay below the north-eastern approach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mission,</b> although there was still uncertainty {{as to whether or}} not the Japanese had withdrawn from the 2,200 feature. To the south-west, the 2/23rd began skirting north around the main positions at Sattelberg, making for the 3,200 feature. After they had struck Turn-Off Corner, the infantry from the 2/23rd were accompanied by engineers from the 2/13th Field Company, who were tasked with laying down a makeshift road, over which the tanks that had been re-allocated to the 2/23rd would traverse.|$|E
5|$|Pellerin was {{originally}} scheduled {{to fly in}} this mission, {{as he had done}} on the 17 June flight.

Thus, Wolff was not aware of the planned mission profile and did not have an opportunity to raise any objections before take-off.|$|E
5|$|The Bolling Commission (also {{known as}} the Bolling Mission and named after Colonel Raynal Bolling, {{the head of the}} mission) was an {{aeronautical}} commission sent to Europe on behalf of the Aircraft Production Board of the Council of National Defense.

5|$|The raid {{was carried}} out by {{approximately}} two dozen heliborne U.S. Navy SEALs from DEVGRU's Red Squadron. For legal reasons (namely that the U.S. was not at war with Pakistan), the military personnel assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> were temporarily transferred to the control of the civilian Central Intelligence Agency. The SEALs operated in multiple teams, and were equipped with a variety of gear and weaponry.

5|$|Upon first {{learning}} of the book in 2007, Berg arranged several meetings with Luttrell to discuss adapting the book to film. Universal Pictures secured the film rights in August 2007 after bidding against other major studios. In re-enacting the events of Operation Red Wings, Berg drew much of his screenplay from Luttrell's eyewitness accounts in the book, as well as autopsy and incident reports related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mission.</b> After directing Battleship (2012) for Universal, Berg returned to work on Lone Survivor. Principal photography began in October 2012 and concluded in November after 42 days. Filming took place on location in New Mexico, using digital cinematography. Luttrell and several other Navy SEAL veterans acted as technical advisors, while multiple branches of the United States Armed Forces aided the production.|$|E
5|$|After {{hearing that}} Englishman George Gauld had {{surveyed}} Gulf Coast {{all the way}} to Galveston Bay in 1777, Bernardo de Gálvez appointed a French engineer, Luis Antonio Andry, to conduct a similar survey for Spain. Andry finished his survey in March 1778, and anchored off Matagorda Bay after running dangerously low on provisions. Over a period of days, the Karankawa lured a few men at a time from the ship with offers of assistance and killed all but one, a Mayan sailor named Tomás de la Cruz. The Karankawa also burned the ship and the newly created map, possibly the first detailed Spanish map of the Texas-Louisiana coast. Several months later, the Indians living at Mission Rosario, near La Bahía, escaped to join the Karankawa, and together they began raiding livestock and harassing settlers. The governor pardoned many of the fugitives, and most of them returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mission.</b> The Karankawa continued to cause difficulties for the Spanish, and in 1785 the interim commandant-general, Joseph Antonio Rengel, noted that they were unable to explore in the Matagorda Bay region as long as the Karankawa held it.|$|E

5|$|After landing, Young and Duke began {{powering}} {{down some of}} the LM's systems to conserve battery power. Upon completing their initial adjustments, the pair configured Orion for their three-day stay on the lunar surface, removed their space suits and took initial geological observations of the immediate landing site. They then settled down for their first meal on the surface. After eating, they configured the cabin for their first sleep period on the Moon. The landing delay caused by the malfunction in the Command/Service Module's main engine necessitated significant modifications <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> schedule. Apollo 16 would spend one less day in lunar orbit after surface exploration had been completed to afford the crew contingency time to compensate for any further problems and to conserve expendables. In order to improve Young's and Duke's sleep schedule, the third and final moonwalk of the mission was trimmed from seven hours to five.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{missions}} {{were actually}} located along the Santa Ana River or within the watershed, the river basin was nearly depleted of native people because the Spanish {{forced them to}} work at nearby missions, including Mission San Gabriel Arcangel and Mission San Luis Rey. The affected tribes were usually renamed after the missions, resulting in tribal names such as Gabrieliño and Luiseño. Difficult working and living conditions and European diseases such as smallpox killed much of the native population during the roughly 50-year-long Mission Period. The Secularization Act of 1833, passed by the newly independent country of Mexico, eventually brought an end <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mission</b> Period. The post-Mission Period native population was almost entirely devastated. The population was very little, their native religions were nearly lost, and most of their land had been taken by Spanish settlers. Although the Mexican government's original intention with the Secularization Act was to provide the Native Americans with their own land and property, most of the provisions made by the act never actually happened. Spanish settlers continued to press into the remaining tribal lands, and eventually, the tribes were forced into the surrounding desert lands or into the high mountains.|$|E
5|$|Coastal Command was {{assigned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> of defending the Convoys from aerial assault also. It lacked the proper training, tactics and suitable aircraft {{to pose a}} serious threat to Luftwaffe operations until the beginning of 1942. The Luftwaffe had also neglected naval aviation. Its only suitable weapon for use {{in the battle of the}} Atlantic was the Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor. The Fw 200s began attacks in July 1940 from airfields in occupied France. At the time, Coastal Command had only 60 Avro Ansons, Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys, Short Sunderlands, and Lockheed Hudsons, all too slow and lightly armed to intercept the Fw 200. Most were also short-range. The Sunderland had the firepower and endurance, but was too slow to catch the Condor. Only one or two aircraft were sent to cover convoys as they approached Britain as a result air-to-air combat was rare. Only five recorded actions took place. The results were two RAF aircraft destroyed (one Hudson and one Whitley) for two Luftwaffe Condors destroyed and one damaged. Between August 1940 and February 1941, Fw 200s sank 85 vessels for a claimed total of 363,000 Grt.|$|E
