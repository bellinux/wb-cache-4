25|$|Roger Ramey {{sent the}} demo <b>tape</b> <b>out</b> to every major label in Nashville, and {{was met with}} a solid wall of {{rejection}} by them all. After a month of not getting anywhere, out of desperation to help his sister, {{he decided to take}} a chance with MCA Nashville. MCA, being the industry leader at the time was his first choice of labels. Taking a cassette of the five song demo of Loveless, Roger bluffed his way past the receptionist of Tony Brown, the head of A (Artist & Repertoire – in charge of finding and developing new talent) by pretending to be someone else who was late for an appointment.|$|E

He then Taylor the list of generals for whom arrangements needed to be made, and then asked the ambassador to repeat the names for confirmation. Taylor did so, unaware that Khánh was taping the dialogue. Afterwards, Khánh played back the <b>tape</b> <b>out</b> of context to his colleagues, giving them the impression that Taylor was calling {{for them to be}} expelled. Khánh asked his colleagues to participate in a campaign of fomenting anti-American street protests and {{to give the impression that}} the country did not need aid from Washington.|$|E
500|$|As the President {{prepares for}} a {{televised}} {{speech to the}} leaders at the summit meeting, he thanks Snake for saving him. Snake asks {{how he feels about}} the people who died saving him, but the President only offers half-hearted regret. As Snake walks away in disgust, Hauk offers Snake a job, which he refuses. The President's speech commences, and he offers the contents of the cassette; to his embarrassment, the tape is Cabbie's cassette of the swing song [...] "Bandstand Boogie". As Snake walks away, he intentionally tears the magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>out</b> of the cassette reel with the actual message that was intended to be delivered by the President.|$|E

500|$|Later, Khánh phoned Taylor {{from his}} office and {{expressed}} his desire to resign and go abroad along with several other generals, asking for the Americans to fund the travel costs. He then read Taylor the list of generals for whom arrangements needed to be made, and asked the ambassador to repeat the names for confirmation. Taylor did so, unaware Khánh was taping the dialogue. Afterwards, Khánh played the <b>tape</b> <b>out</b> of context to his colleagues, giving them the impression Taylor was calling for their expulsion from their own country. Khánh then asked his colleagues {{to participate in a}} campaign of fomenting anti-American street protests and to give the impression the country did not need Washington's aid. A CIA informant reported the recent arguments with Taylor had incensed the volatile Thi so much that he had privately vowed to [...] "blow up everything" [...] and [...] "kill Phan Khắc Sửu, Trần Văn Hương and Nguyễn Khánh {{and put an end to}} all this. Then we will see what happens." ...|$|E
500|$|Patton's [...] "big break" [...] came in 2002, when he {{was cast}} to replace Steve Burns as Joe, the second host of the Nickelodeon children's {{television}} program Blue's Clues. [...] He was up for a part in [...] at the time, but considered the role as Joe [...] "a happy accident". [...] Patton became a [...] "household name" [...] and has been called [...] "an unqualified star to the 5-and-under set and their parents". [...] He was subjected to [...] "the same kind of scrutiny" [...] as Burns, {{who was involved in}} Patton's selection and helped train him, to earn the role. [...] Patton was selected out of 1,500 auditions. [...] He had never seen the show before his audition, but like Burns was the favorite with preschool test audiences. [...] He said, [...] "I am convinced that I got that part because of a Christopher Walken impression I sometimes do. [...] There's a <b>tape</b> <b>out</b> there, somewhere, with both Steve Burns and myself doing a Blue's Clues scene both as Christopher Walken, which we did at the screen test. I haven't seen the tape, but I know somewhere it still exists". [...] Beginning in September 2000, Burns trained Patton to take over the host spot and advised him not to [...] "think of [...] as children's TV", but rather as [...] "acting and telling the truth".|$|E

50|$|CVAX+ {{referred}} to an optical shrink {{of the original}} CVAX fabricated in DEC's second-generation CMOS process, CMOS-2, a 1.5 µm process with two levels of wiring.

5|$|More than 300 {{hours of}} footage was {{recorded}} by {{the students and the}} two Iraqi associate producers. It was transcribed, translated and edited into a 90-minute film. Getting the <b>tapes</b> <b>out</b> of Iraq proved difficult for Winter and O'Mahoney, who remained in the UK. They had to rely on journalists from many news agencies, especially those in the BBC News's Baghdad Bureau high-risk team, to smuggle the <b>tapes</b> <b>out</b> of Iraq. When curfews were enforced, weeks passed before the producers received new footage because it was impossible for anybody to leave their homes or the country.|$|R
60|$|Ascending, {{we reached}} an open grassy valley, and overtook the Tibetans who had preceded us, {{and who had}} halted here to feed their sheep. A good-looking girl of the party came to ask me for {{medicine}} for her husband's eyes, which had suffered from snow-blindness: she brought me a present of snuff, and carried a little child, stark naked, yet warm from the powerful rays of the sun, at nearly 14,000 feet elevation, in December! I prescribed for the man, and gave the mother a bright farthing to hang round the child's neck, which delighted the party. My watch was only wondered at; but a little spring measuring-tape that rolled itself up, struck them dumb, and when I threw {{it on the ground}} with the <b>tape</b> <b>out,</b> the mother shrieked and ran away, while the little savage howled after her.|$|E

50|$|To combat these {{variation}} effects, {{modern technology}} processes often supply SPICE or BSIM simulation models for all (or, at the least, TT, FS, and SF) process corners, which enables circuit designers to detect corner skew effects before {{the design is}} laid out, as well as post-layout (through parasitics extraction), before it is <b>taped</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R

He helped bring about the first high-volume integrated manufacture of video cassettes for the motion picture industry. Tapes had previously been made in real time, with hundreds of high school students changing <b>out</b> <b>tapes,</b> but when Bob Pfannkuch heard that DuPont started making <b>tapes</b> <b>out</b> of chromium dioxide instead of iron dioxide, Bell & Howell developed technology that could make a copy of a film in about a minute, cutting production time by over 99 percent.|$|R
