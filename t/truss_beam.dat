The thermos cabinet and the original box shaped top beam of casing compose a <b>truss</b> <b>beam</b> system whose overall section height is increased greatly, resultantly, the bend bearing capacity of <b>truss</b> <b>beam</b> increases significantly {{than that of the}} original top beam of casing. Consequently, the wall thickness of box section of the original top beam can be reduced so that the steel consumption can be saved. Based on a practical project, the load effects on <b>truss</b> <b>beam</b> were investigated, respectively, including the air pressure difference and the temperature difference among external layer, thermos cabinet and interior of casing. Besides, the evaluation method of internal force in <b>truss</b> <b>beam</b> was investigated and the selective preference of <b>truss</b> <b>beam</b> configuration was conducted. The unfavorable load cases of air pressure difference and temperature difference are proposed for <b>truss</b> <b>beam</b> design.

40|$|The {{definition}} “hybrid trussed beams” {{indicates a}} particular type of steel-concrete structural elements which are composed by prefabricated steel trusses completed by in-situ casting of concrete (cast-in-place concrete). They can be classified among the partially prefabricated and composed structure. 	From their first ideation and introduction, that goes back in 1967 by means of S. Leone, the interest of the civil engineering for hybrid <b>trussed</b> <b>beams</b> has been continuously increasing and nowadays they cover a relevant part of the total demand of beam prefabrication in Italy and applications range from the more traditional residential and industrial constructions to the infrastructure realizations. 	The increasing appeal of hybrid <b>trussed</b> <b>beams</b> now claims the definition of a standard for their calculation and realization. Perhaps the theoretical studies and experimental investigations conduced in the past on this structures are partial and insufficient to give a complete and exhaustive explanation of their structural performance, specially for the aspects of ductility and shear resistance. An articulate experimental program have been planned at the University of Padova to give a contribution in this field. 	In this work the first results from tests conduced on simply supported beams to investigate the flexural and shear behavior of the hybrid <b>trussed</b> <b>beams</b> are reported. The tests have been conduced on a series of 8 classic beams (named REP® NOR beams) made with a lower steel plate. Four of these have been loaded as bare, without integrative casting, to simulate the working condition in the first phase. The remaining four were completed with the concrete casting and tested. Globally 10 destructive tests have been conduced, both in the shear and in bending fields. In the paper, after the description of the test setup, the experimental results will be listed. The basic concepts of the experimentally observed behavior of hybrid <b>trussed</b> <b>beams</b> are reported together with some preliminary proposals for their safe design...|$|R
