40|$|An {{enterprise}} (transferor) may transfer receivables to {{an unrelated}} third party (transferee) and retain {{an obligation to}} compensate the transferee {{for the failure of}} the debtors to pay when due. The transfer meets all the conditions of paragraph 5 of Statement 77 to be recognized as a sale. One of those conditions is that the amount of the transferor's obligation under the recourse provisions must be able to be reasonably estimated at the date of sale. Paragraph 6 of Statement 77 states that "if a transfer qualifies to be recognized as a sale, all probable adjustments in connection with the recourse obligations to <b>the</b> <b>transferor</b> <b>shall</b> be accrued in accordance with FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies.

40|$|Multiple {{law reform}} efforts are {{underway}} {{to reverse the}} no-implied-conditions-of-survivorship rule historically applying to future interests. Yet, whenever the NICS rule is reversed, a reversion arises in <b>the</b> <b>transferor</b> of <b>the</b> future interests—which reversion will take effect if the newly-implied conditions of survivorship fail—unless the NICS-rule-reversal reform itself negates that reversion. The most well-known NICS-rule-reversal reform, Uniform Probate Code section 2 - 707, negates <b>the</b> <b>transferor’s</b> reversion, but other reforms do not. When the reversion is not negated, complicated transfer tax issues arise. First, for gift tax purposes, the reversion must be valued, because {{the value of the}} reversion is subtracted in valuing <b>the</b> <b>transferor’s</b> gift. Second, if <b>the</b> <b>transferor</b> dies at a time when any of the future interests she created continue as future interests (i. e., the interests have yet to arise in possession or fail), the at-death value of <b>the</b> <b>transferor’s</b> reversion is included in her federal gross estate under Internal Revenue Code section 2033, unless her reversion fails at her death, in which case Internal Revenue Code section 2037 includes an amount greater than the immediately-before-death value of <b>the</b> <b>transferor’s</b> reversion; section 2037 includes the after-death value of the property interests replacing the reversion. Application of section 2037 and of section 2033 in this context always requires determining the probability that one person survives another, and nothing presently exists in the legal literature to demonstrate how to do that. This article surveys life contingency actuarial mathematics and provides a method. Two points become clear.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 A major {{barrier to}} air travel {{for people with}} disabilities is the general lack of {{accessible}} lavatories on board commercial passenger aircraft. A primary reason for this lack of greater accessibility is related to space. To design an airplane lavatory that is accessible, minimizes the risk of injury to both <b>the</b> <b>transferor</b> and transferee to the extent possible, and is still consistent with the restrictive spatial requirements of airplane environments requires a broader understanding as to how the relative angle of the wheelchair to the toilet affects assisted toilet transfers. This study investigated how the wheelchair-to-toilet angle affects both the spatial consumption required for assisted toilet transfers and the risk of injury to <b>the</b> <b>transferor</b> and transferee. Twenty-nine participants (transferors) were motion captured in a laboratory environment while conducting assisted toilet transfers using a pivot transfer technique at relative wheelchair-to-toilet angles of 0 º, 45 º, 90 º, and 180 º. A 95 th percentile male dummy represented the transferee. A novel, three-dimensional computer-based spatial mapping technique was developed to compute the spatial volume requirements of assisted toilet transfers from the motion capture data. The wheelchair-to-toilet angle directly affected the total spatial volume needed to conduct an assisted toilet transfer. The total rectangular area required to perform an assisted toilet transfer using a pivot transfer technique progressively increased as the wheelchair-to-toilet angle rose from 0 º to 180 º. However, the three-dimensional volume required for an assisted transfer differs between transfer angles, is non-rectangular, and varies in spatial area over the height of the transfer volume. The wheelchair-to-toilet angle also affected the magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>transferor's</b> kinematic risk factors for lower back disorder. Eight of the fourteen analyzed kinematic risk factors for lower back disorder were affected. Of these risk factors, the wheelchair-to-toilet angle primarily affected <b>the</b> <b>transferor's</b> odds of being at high risk of lower back disorder through its effect on <b>the</b> <b>transferor's</b> maximum load moment arm. Surprisingly, the magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>transferor's</b> maximum load moment arm was inversely related to the wheelchair-to-toilet angle. After accounting for the effects of the wheelchair-to-toilet angle and the direction of assisted transfer, associations were also found between <b>the</b> <b>transferor's</b> kinematic risk factors for lower back disorder and <b>the</b> <b>transferor's</b> standing height. <b>The</b> {{results of this study suggest}} that accessible lavatories can be designed for use in constrained environments by designing the lavatory to support assisted transfers at a single optimal wheelchair-to-toilet angle. The results further suggest that, in using a pivot transfer technique, the 180 º orientation is an optimal transfer orientation. Finally, it is suggested that transferors short in stature and physically capable of conducting assisted transfers should be preferentially selected to assist in assisted transfers, as they are predicted to have a lower risk of lower back disorder than taller transferors.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} English and German law on {{impaired}} consent transfers of movable property in comparative perspective. It seeks {{to expose the}} fundamental structures shaping the legal analysis of such transfers and their unwinding in both systems, paying {{particular attention to the}} interaction between different rules and prinCiples of contract law, property law and the law (2) of unjust(ified) enrichment. After an introductory overview, the thesis begins by describing, comparing and contrasting the English and German solutions in cases involving only <b>the</b> <b>transferor</b> and <b>the</b> transferee ('twoparty cases'). Questions such as the scope of recovery, the relationship between contract and conveyance, the nature of any remedy available to <b>the</b> <b>transferor</b> and its treatment in the transferee's insolvency are put into comparative focus without being severed from their proper conceptual context. With regard to the still unsettled English position, the thesis argues for a generalised power model of proprietary restitution. It seeks to demonstrate that conveyances by delivery are best regarded as 'abstract' in English as well as German law, but explains why much of the gist of abstraction as espoused by the German BGB is lacking in English law [...] The second main part of the thesis concerns the special issues raised by 'three-party cases'. Building on the preceding analysis, it examines the position of third parties who have acquired the object in question from the transferee before <b>the</b> <b>transferor</b> has had a chance to reclaim it. As far as the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>transferor</b> and <b>the</b> transferee is concerned, it calls for the abolition of the so-called 'third party rights bar to rescission' in English law. It also highlights similarities and differences in the extent to which both legal systems allow <b>the</b> <b>transferor</b> to claim <b>the</b> object's traceable substitutes from the transferee (or from third parties).

40|$|The paper proposes two {{significant}} modifications of Japan’s Act on Transfer of Bonds, Shares, etc. (BETA). First, it suggests the control agreement method of transferring {{an interest in}} securities that is effective against third parties. Under the BETA, {{the creation of an}} effective interest in book-entry securities requires book entries in the securities accounts of <b>the</b> <b>transferor</b> and <b>the</b> transferee. Under the control agreement approach, <b>the</b> <b>transferor,</b> transferee, and <b>the</b> <b>transferor’s</b> securities intermediary would agree that (i) the intermediary would act on the instructions of the transferee with respect to securities credited to <b>the</b> <b>transferor’s</b> securities account or (ii) the intermediary would not act on the instructions of <b>the</b> <b>transferor</b> or (iii) both (i) and (ii). No book entries would be necessary. Second, it proposes to permit the creation of an effective transfer of an interest in a securities account—i. e., in any securities that from time to time are credited to a securities account—again, without book entries with respect to specific securities. The paper explains the historical origins of the control agreement and securities account concepts as they evolved in the revisions of UCC Articles 8 and 9 and as subsequently adopted by the GSC, providing inspiration for our proposals. It describes the transfer of securities under the BETA and it explains how the BETA could be revised to adopt the proposals. It also identifies some troublesome aspects of the BETA’s treatment of title transfer security interests (jōto tanpo) {{in the context of a}} transferee’s insolvency proceeding. The core of the paper is a policy analysis of the proposals. We conclude that the revisions would fit well with the underlying policies and the basic structure of the BETA and that on balance the revisions would be beneficial, such as by providing flexibility in financing and potentially lowering transactions costs...|$|R
