5|$|Akash (Ranbir Kapoor) {{lives in}} New York City; he has bankrupted his company {{and is in}} need of $12 million for paying the shareholders, but is unable to obtain a loan due to a stock market crash. He decides to jump off the George Washington Bridge. He meets Kiara (Priyanka Chopra), from San Francisco, who is also suicidal after {{catching}} her fiancé Kunal (Zayed Khan) cheating on her. Akash and Kiara attempt <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>themselves,</b> but are prevented from doing so by the Coast Guard. Still suicidal, Akash deliberately allows himself to be hit by a car, and Kiara falls on the bridge and breaks her neck. Their suicide attempts are unsuccessful, and they end up in hospital together. When they are discharged, Kiara takes Akash to her apartment because his house has been seized by the bank.|$|E
5|$|The pair try <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>themselves</b> five times, failing each time. Eventually, {{they make}} a pact to end their lives on 31 December 2009. With 20 days left before their deadline, they decide to fulfill their unrealised wishes and begin a journey together. Kiara helps Akash find a date and shares with him how Kunal cheated on her. The next day, Akash cleans Kiara's messy apartment. Though he cannot swim, Akash is forced to fulfil Kiara's wish to swim in the cold Atlantic Ocean. However, at sea Kiara falls {{overboard}} and Akash rescues her. Their yacht drifts away, stranding them. As the two slowly succumb to hypothermia, Kiara continues telling her story to Akash. They are rescued again by the Coast Guard officer who intervened on the bridge.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to prevent poisoning, often a bittering agent called denatonium benzoate, known by the trade name Bitrex, is added to {{ethylene}} glycol preparations as an adversant to prevent accidental or intentional ingestion. The bittering agent is thought to stop ingestion {{as part of the}} human defense against ingestion of harmful substances is rejection of bitter tasting substances. In the United States, eight states (Oregon, California, New Mexico, Virginia, Arizona, Maine, Tennessee, Washington) have made the addition of bittering agents to antifreeze compulsory. Three follow up studies targeting limited populations or suicidal persons to assess the efficacy of bittering agents in preventing toxicity or death have, however, shown limited benefit of bittering ethylene glycol preparations in these two populations. Specifically, Mullins finds that bittering of antifreeze does not reduce reported cases of poisoning of preschoolers in the US state of Oregon. Similarly, White found that adding bittering agents did not decrease the frequency or severity of antifreeze poisonings in {{children under the age of}} 5. Additionally, another study by White found that suicidal persons are not deterred by the bittered taste of antifreeze in their attempts <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>themselves.</b> These studies did not focus on poisoning of domestic pets or livestock, for example, or inadvertent exposure to bittered antifreeze among a large population (of non-preschool age children).|$|E
50|$|In extenuating {{situations}} where continuing to live would be intolerable, some people use suicide {{as a means}} of escape. Some inmates in Nazi concentration camps are known <b>to</b> have <b>killed</b> <b>themselves</b> by deliberately touching the electrified fences.|$|R
50|$|Japanese seppuku {{falls into}} this category. The culture {{practiced by the}} samurai {{expected}} them <b>to</b> ritually <b>kill</b> <b>themselves</b> if found disloyal, sparing a daimyō or shogun the indignity of executing a follower. This was especially {{the case in the}} Edo period, and Asano Naganori was a clear example.|$|R
50|$|Heavy {{shooting}} and shelling began, which {{continued into the}} night. The armed members of the column returned fire and all scattered. Survivors describe a group of at least 1000 engaged at close range by small arms. Hundreds appear <b>to</b> have been <b>killed</b> as they fled the open area and some were said <b>to</b> have <b>killed</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> escape capture.|$|R
25|$|According to the National Traveller Suicide Awareness Project, Traveller men {{are over}} six {{times more likely}} <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>themselves</b> than the general population.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch only {{offered them}} exile to nearby Madura or Lombok, and they {{preferred}} <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>themselves</b> (puputan) in prison two days later.|$|E
25|$|The first {{insight into}} the {{mechanism}} came from studying BCL2, {{the product of a}} putative oncogene activated by chromosome translocations often found in follicular lymphoma. Unlike other cancer genes, which promote cancer by stimulating cell proliferation, BCL2 promoted cancer by stopping lymphoma cells from being able <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|E
50|$|Wynschenk was {{haunted by}} survivor’s guilt, {{according}} to Louis de Groot of the Holocaust Center, who {{described him as}} “very scarred from his wartime experiences. There were very few people who understood him. He never was able to really conquer the damage that had been inflicted on him. He lived {{with a lot of}} guilt.” That his sisters came out of hiding on his account, only <b>to</b> be <b>killed</b> <b>themselves,</b> “was a very big burden that he carried,” de Groot said.|$|R
5|$|There {{have been}} anecdotal reports of dogs, horses and {{dolphins}} killing themselves. There, however, {{has been little}} scientific study of animal suicide. Animal suicide is usually put down to romantic human interpretation and is not generally thought to be intentional. Some of the reasons animals are thought <b>to</b> unintentionally <b>kill</b> <b>themselves</b> include: psychological stress, infection by certain parasites or fungi, or disruption of a long held social tie, such as the ending of a long association with an owner and thus not accepting food from another individual.|$|R
50|$|Before the One Church, {{there were}} {{religious}} wars, different sects fighting over who was right; fighting for dominance. Even now, when Cassandra {{thinks that the}} so-called infidels might be better running things, Aunt Abby points out that everyone would {{tell them what to}} do. She makes references <b>to</b> terrorists who <b>kill</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> make a stand.|$|R
25|$|Another study {{involving}} {{more than}} one million people, conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses. Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, unipolar depression, and substance abuse, and were almost twice as likely as the general population <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>themselves.</b> Dancers and photographers {{were also more likely to}} have bipolar disorder.|$|E
25|$|Tender is {{a member}} of the fanatical Creedish cult, which engaged in a mass suicide ten years previously. He is one of the Creedish members who was sent out into the world to work as a servant, and send his income back to the Creedish community. Creedish members have been {{steadily}} killing themselves since the mass suicide, in keeping with their belief that the deliverance is at hand. At the start of his story, Tender works as the housekeeper for a rich couple he never sees in Oregon. They issue directions via a daily planner and a speaker phone. At his dingy apartment, he gets phone calls from people who want <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>themselves</b> - the result of a newspaper misprint which printed his phone number as the number for a suicide prevention hotline. Tender, enjoying the thrill of passing divine judgment on these people tells them <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>themselves</b> as often as not, and sees this as an act of mercy. Although the newspaper prints a retraction, the calls keep coming, and when they dwindle, Tender prints up fliers for a fake crisis hotline with his number on them so the calls will continue.|$|E
25|$|During {{another meeting}} with his {{caseworker}} (which regularly takes place at his employers' house), Tender gets frustrated and tells {{her that if she}} wants to help him, she can start by scrubbing the shower tiles. Burnt out over a decade of lost suicide cases, the caseworker quickly grows obsessed with cleaning and soon takes over Tender's job, drifting more and more away from helping him confront his past. She reveals at this time that many of the Creedish suicides were really murders masked to look like suicides to encourage more survivors <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|E
50|$|Riley {{breaks into}} Crowe's stronghold and kills the {{remaining}} mercenaries. Crowe manages to escape, {{leading to a}} street chase. Crowe reveals his intentions and manages to shoot Riley, but Riley shoots {{him down on the}} street. Riley is about <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Crowe, and Ganz shouts at him to do it, but Riley decides not kill him; instead, Weddo and his gang drive up and take Crowe with them, presumably <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> him <b>themselves.</b> Later, Riley visits Ganz's child's birthday party. Afterward, he visits the cemetery where his son is buried.|$|R
50|$|Unlike his predecessor, Jake is {{completely}} unwilling <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> corrupt police officers, {{no matter how}} heinous their crimes. In one instance, he refuses after several officers try and kill him with a cyborg gladiator. After Jake manages <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> the gladiator, the officers attempt <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Jake <b>themselves.</b> He hides, refusing to fire, but his suit is over-ridden by his partner Matt, who kills the cops (ironically, Matt himself is a policeman, and, as a more sensible, charitable man, usually acts as Jake's conscience). Matt would be involved with several more incidents with the Punisher, sometimes teaming up with others to help him.|$|R
50|$|Lelouch {{possesses}} {{very strong}} philosophical beliefs: beliefs that define both his actions and his motivations. Perhaps his most notable motivation {{is that he}} rejects his father's beliefs of Social Darwinism. He believes the world can live in cooperation rather than competition and conflict. To achieve this aim, {{he believes that the}} ends justify the means; he is willing to commit evil if it means bringing down a worse evil in the process. Lelouch also has strong beliefs concerning death and killing, thinking that one should kill only if they are prepared <b>to</b> be <b>killed</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|R
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} known associations between the media and suicide arose from Goethe's novel Die Leiden des jungen Werthers (The Sorrows of Young Werther). Soon after its publication in 1774, young men began to mimic the main character by dressing in yellow pants and blue jackets. In the novel, Werther shoots himself with a pistol after he is rejected by the woman he loves, and shortly after its publication {{there were reports of}} young men using the same method <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>themselves</b> in an act of hopelessness.|$|E
25|$|Yosef Ben-Matityahu {{had hidden}} {{in one of}} the caves that litter the site, along with 40 other {{prominent}} citizens of Yodfat. Although Ben-Matityahu was in favour of surrendering to the Romans, the majority of his comrades opted <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>themselves</b> rather than fall into Roman hands. As suicide is considered sinful, they decided to draw lots to kill each other. Ben-Matityahu and another man, however, were the last to survive, and both resolved to give themselves up. Taken to see the Roman general, Ben-Matityahu prophesied that Vespasian would one day become emperor. Vespasian subsequently spared the rebel leader, who began collaborating with the Romans. At first a slave, he would later be freed and be granted Roman citizenship as Flavius Josephus.|$|E
25|$|Delacroix {{produced}} a second painting {{in support of}} the Greeks in their war for independence, this time referring to the capture of Missolonghi by Turkish forces in 1825. With a restraint of palette appropriate to the allegory, Greece Expiring on the Ruins of Missolonghi displays a woman in Greek costume with her breast bared, arms half-raised in an imploring gesture before the horrible scene: the suicide of the Greeks, who chose <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>themselves</b> and destroy their city rather than surrender to the Turks. A hand is seen at the bottom, the body having been crushed by rubble. The painting serves as a monument to the people of Missolonghi and to the idea of freedom against tyrannical rule. This event interested Delacroix not only for his sympathies with the Greeks, but also because the poet Byron, whom Delacroix greatly admired, had died there.|$|E
500|$|Mulder {{arrives at}} the school, where Scully claims that she never called him. They find Mrs. Paddock {{seemingly}} attacked by the remaining faculty members, and go to search for them. The faculty members capture the two agents, convinced {{that they need to}} perform a sacrifice to regain favor with the Devil and make up for their diluted faith before it is too late. As they are about <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Mulder and Scully, Mrs. Paddock causes them <b>to</b> instead <b>kill</b> <b>themselves,</b> confirming that their attempt was indeed too late. The agents escape their bonds and find Mrs. Paddock missing, with only a parting message on the chalkboard stating, [...] "Goodbye. It's been nice working with you." ...|$|R
2500|$|People who {{are known}} <b>to</b> have <b>killed</b> <b>themselves</b> with a {{barbiturate}} overdose include Charles Boyer, Dalida, Phyllis Hyman, Carole Landis, Jean Seberg, Abbie Hoffman, Felix Hausdorff and C. P. Ramanujam. Others {{who have died}} as a result of barbiturate overdose include Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe, Ellen Wilkinson, Dorothy Kilgallen, Brian Epstein, [...] Alan Wilson, Jimi Hendrix, Edie Sedgwick, Inger Stevens and Kenneth Williams; in some cases these have been speculated to be suicides as well. Dorothy Dandridge died of either an overdose or an unrelated embolism. Ingeborg Bachmann may have died of the consequences of barbiturate withdrawal.|$|R
5000|$|Lolita Lebrón, Vilar’s grandmother, led {{an armed}} {{attack on the}} United States House of Representatives on March 1, 1954. [...] She had been {{inspired}} by Puerto Rican nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos. She, along with three male counterparts, sat in the visitor’s area, called “The Ladies’ Gallery” and opened fire in the chamber. Several congressmen were hurt, {{but no one was}} <b>killed.</b> Due <b>to</b> a recent attack on President Truman’s temporary residence, the nationalist activists were expecting <b>to</b> be <b>killed</b> <b>themselves.</b> Lolita was sentenced to fifty-seven years in prison, of which she served twenty-seven until being pardoned by President Carter.|$|R
25|$|According to Dan Gill, {{geological}} {{investigations in}} the early 1990s confirmed earlier observations that the 114m (375ft) high assault ramp consisted mostly of a natural spur of bedrock. The ramp was complete {{in the spring of}} 73, after probably two to three months of siege, allowing the Romans to finally breach the wall of the fortress with a battering ram on April 16. The Romans employed the X Legion and a number of auxiliary units and Jewish prisoners of war, totaling some 15,000 (of whom an estimated 8,000 to 9,000 were fighting men), in crushing Jewish resistance at Masada. A giant siege tower with a battering ram was constructed and moved laboriously up the completed ramp. The walls of the fortress were breached in 73 CE. According to Josephus, when Roman troops entered the fortress, they discovered that its defendants had set all the buildings but the food storerooms ablaze and committed mass suicide or killed each other, 960 men, women, and children in total. Josephus wrote of two stirring speeches that the Sicari leader had made to convince his men <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>themselves.</b> Only two women and five children were found alive.|$|E
25|$|Here, the traditionalist and Confucianist Muslim generals Ma Anliang and Ma Qi backed Yuan Shikai. Bai Lang faced {{opposition}} from nearly everyone, from the Tibetans serving under the Gansu-allied Yang Jiqing, the Gansu and Sichuan provincial armies, ethnic Hui and Han militias and Yuan Shikai's own National Beiyang Army. Muslim Gen. Ma Qi {{was instructed to}} incite the Muslims against Bai Lang {{in order to get}} Hui and Han to join together and fight him. Muslim imams preached anti-Bai announcements, claiming that Shaxide (Shahid or martyrdom) awaited those who died to fight him off. Unlike the rural areas in central and eastern China, where peasants had helped Bai's armies hide and strike out, Muslim families actively refused to support Bai's troops, even {{going so far as to}} burn themselves to death rather than deal with them. However, the Imams themselves took off and ran away after they told the Muslims <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>themselves,</b> rather than die with them. by a mix of ethnic Han and Hui militia commanded by Ma Qi and Ma Anliang. Ma Qixi's Muslim Xidaotang humiliated and defeatd Bai's bandit forces, who looted the city. The Muslim Generals were reported to be reactionary.|$|E
25|$|An {{ideology}} of preserving family honor is deeply rooted is society {{and is not}} affected by high levels of education. Many women in Turkey are well educated but still {{are expected to be}} modest and sexually pure in order to preserve the honor of their families. If a family's honor is breached, it brings shame to the entire family. In such cases, traditionally the family would decide the fate of the female that brought shame. This might involve forcing the young woman into a shotgun wedding, while in extreme cases a young male in the family was given the duty to cleanse the family name through an honor killing. With recent changes to criminal law that removed reduced sentences for honor killings, females that brought shame to the family are sometimes forced to commit honor suicides by their families, especially in the predominantly Kurdish South-East regions, a region that greatly values traditions. Families who do not want their sons to face possible incrimination have encouraged their daughters to commit suicide. The number of female suicides over the years has increased greatly. Stories have surfaced revealing girls who are given tools with which <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>themselves</b> such as rope to hang themselves, poisons to drink, or a gun to shoot themselves. Some murders have also been disguised as suicides in order to protect family members. Female family members {{are not the only ones}} that may be punished to preserve family honor. It is proposed that the death of a male homosexual physics student, Ahmet Yildiz, was an honor killing.|$|E
50|$|In 1975 he {{reported}} in Science the first recorded case of mass recruitment in army ants. He {{found that when}} worker ants encountered a food source that was too large for them <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> or carry <b>themselves,</b> they can communicate with other workers via chemical and physical signals to recruit them to assist.|$|R
5000|$|Julia {{suffers a}} mental {{breakdown}} after {{the rape and}} confides to Iullus how miserable her life has been under her father's control. In her sorrow she tells him that sometimes she wishes her father were already dead just so her suffering would end. Iullus recites Julia's misery to Scipio and he comes upon with a plan <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Augustus <b>themselves.</b> They agree not to tell Julia of the plan. Tiberius, who is still planning <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Iullus for infidelity with his wife, overhears the plot and informs his mother. Livia decides that they will catch Iullus in the act {{and in doing so}} would rid themselves of Julia also.|$|R
6000|$|The Warden with a {{quart of}} champagne. I have {{dispatched}} it down Murderers Row. Queer, isn't it, that I am so considered this last day. It must be that these men who are <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> me are <b>themselves</b> afraid of death. To quote Jake Oppenheimer: I, who am about to die, must seem to them something God-awful. [...] .|$|R
25|$|Since TCM recognizes bear bile as a medicinal, {{more than}} 12,000 asiatic black bears {{are held in}} bear farms. The bile is {{extracted}} through a permanent hole in the abdomen leading to the gall bladder, which can cause severe pain. This can lead to bears trying <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>themselves.</b> As of 2012, approximately 10,000 bears are farmed in China for their bile. This practice has spurred public outcry across the country. The bile is collected from live bears via a surgical procedure. The deer penis {{is believed to have}} therapeutic benefits according to traditional Chinese medicine. It is typically very big and, proponents believe, in order to preserve its properties, it should be extracted from a living deer. Medicinal tiger parts from poached animals include tiger penis, believed to improve virility, and tiger eyes. The illegal trade for tiger parts in China has driven the species to near-extinction because of its popularity in traditional medicine. Laws protecting even critically endangered species such as the Sumatran tiger fail to stop the display and sale of these items in open markets. Shark fin soup is traditionally regarded in Chinese medicine as beneficial for health in East Asia, and its status as an elite dish has led to huge demand with the increase of affluence in China, devastating shark populations. The shark fins {{have been a part of}} traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. Shark finning is banned in many countries, but the trade is thriving in Hong Kong and China, where the fins are part of shark fin soup, a dish considered a delicacy, and used in some types of traditional Chinese medicine.|$|E

500|$|The Flood are fictional {{parasitic}} alien {{life forms}} in the Halo video game series created by Bungie. They are introduced in [...] as a second enemy faction alongside the Covenant; they return in sequels Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo Wars, and as a gametype in Halo 4. The Flood are driven {{by a desire to}} infect any sentient life they encounter, and are depicted as such a threat that the ancient Forerunners were forced <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>themselves</b> and all other sentient life nearly 100,000 years ago in an effort to starve the Flood to death.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{suppose the}} decemvir {{to be the}} same as the consul of 471, based on his filiation, Ap. f. M. n., in the {{consular}} fasti. Furthermore, both men were said <b>to</b> have <b>killed</b> <b>themselves</b> before they could be brought to trial for their misdeeds. [...] However, chronology suggests that they were different people; the consul of 471 is supposed to have been a candidate for the consulship eleven years earlier, in 482, and his father was a wealthy and powerful man more than twenty years before that, which would have made the consul an older man {{at the time of the}} decemvirate, and when his son, the consular tribune of 424 BC, was born.|$|R
50|$|However, Gudrun and Brynhild later quarreled over {{whose husband}} was greater, Brynhildr boasting that Gunnar had been {{brave enough to}} ride through the flames. Gudrun {{revealed}} that it was actually Sigurðr who rode through the ring of fire, and Brynhildr became enraged. Sigurðr, remembering the truth, tried to console her, but to no avail. Brynhildr plotted revenge by urging Gunnar <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Sigurðr, accusing that he took her virginity on Hidarfjall, which he swore not to do. Gunnar and his brother Hogni (Hagen in the Nibelungenlied) were afraid <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> him <b>themselves,</b> as they had sworn oaths of brotherhood to Sigurðr. They incited their younger brother, Gutthorm, <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Sigurðr, by giving him a magic potion of enragement, and Gutthorm murdered Sigurðr in his sleep. As he was dying, Sigurðr threw his sword at Gutthorm, killing him. (some Eddic poems say Gutthorm killed him in the forest south of the Rhine, also while resting).|$|R
5000|$|After {{the girl}} had called him a loser, Ryan said, [...] "It's girls like you who make me want <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> myself." [...] His father found out about this later {{because it was a}} matter of record with the local police. Halligan's father also {{discovered}} some disturbing conversations between Ryan and a boy with a screen name he did not recognize. Halligan began communicating online with a pen-pal about suicide and death, and told him he was thinking about suicide. They had been exchanging information they had found on sites relating to death and suicide, including sites that taught them how <b>to</b> painlessly <b>kill</b> <b>themselves.</b> The pen-pal answered [...] "Phew. It's about fucking time," [...] shortly after Ryan told him he was thinking about suicide, two weeks before he killed himself. This was the last conversation he had with the pen-pal. As Halligan found out, contrary to popular belief, Ryan's pen-pal was a boy Ryan knew up until third grade when the boy and his parents moved away. When they found each other online, they reconnected.|$|R
