When asked whether the politics attracted him to the film, Rea replied [...] "Well, I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> interesting if it was just comic-book stuff. The politics of it are what gives it its dimension and momentum, and of course I was interested in the politics. Why wouldn't I be?" ...|$|E
500|$|In Brideshead, the proletarian junior officer Hooper {{illustrates}} {{a theme that}} persists in Waugh's postwar fiction: the rise of mediocrity in the [...] "Age of the Common Man". In the trilogy Sword of Honour [...] (Men at Arms, 1952; Officers and Gentlemen, 1955, Unconditional Surrender, 1961) the social pervasiveness of mediocrity is personified in the semi-comical character [...] "Trimmer", a sloven and a fraud who triumphs by contrivance. In the novella [...] "Scott-King's Modern Europe" [...] (1947), Waugh's pessimism about the future is in the schoolmaster's admonition: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> wicked, indeed, {{to do anything to}} fit a boy for the modern world". Likewise, such cynicism pervades the novel Love Among the Ruins (1953), set in a dystopian, welfare-state Britain that is so socially disagreeable that euthanasia is the most sought-after of the government's social services. Of the postwar novels, Patey says that [...] The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold (1957) stands out ″a kind of mock-novel, a sly invitation to a game″. Waugh's final work of fiction, [...] "Basil Seal Rides Again" [...] (1962), features characters from the prewar novels; Waugh admitted that the work was a ″senile attempt to recapture the manner of my youth″. Stylistically this final story begins in the same fashion as the first story, ″The Balance" [...] of 1926, with a [...] "fusillade of unattributed dialogue".|$|E

2500|$|In May 2013 Ella {{reflected}} on her time with Killing Heidi {{and the likelihood}} of any reunion, [...] "I don't think I could sing such youthful, and youth based songs convincingly any more. It really did just run its natural course and I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> unnatural to start it up again now." [...] Aside from the Verses, Ella has a career as a solo performer, radio presenter and TV personality. Her brother Jesse would go on to a career as a music teacher, producer and community arts developer.|$|E
2500|$|Homicide {{case against}} Italian VPD marines: Italy had {{threatened}} to leverage its influence within the Institutions of the European Union to impact relations with India over the ongoing legal wranglings regarding the case of two Italian Navy Marines who India holds responsible for shootings which lead {{to the deaths of}} two Indian fishermen. Federica Mogherini, who was the Italian foreign minister prior to becoming the EUHRVP and head of the European External Affairs Service (EEAS) told the European Parliament in January 2015 that [...] "it's good for everyone to be fully aware of how much of an impact the unresolved dispute of the two Italian Navy officials can have on relations between the EU and India. It is putting them to the test". Italian MEPs led debates in the European Parliament and obtained a resolution condemning India for alleged human-rights violations of the two Italian Navy marines. The legal squibblings over the fate of the two Italian marines compounded already tense bilateral relations following earlier investigations in Italy which revealed that Finmeccanica had made illegal payments in the procurement of a fleet of 12 AgustaWestland AW101 helicopters by the Indian Air Force. The European External Affairs Service (EEAS) decided not respond to repeated Indian queries on dates for the Indian Prime-Minister to visit Brussels. Cesare Onestini, the Political Chargé d'Affaires of the Delegation of the European Union to India said: [...] "No date has been formally proposed to the Indian side." [...] The European Parliament's Chair for the delegation on relations with India, Geoffrey Van Orden, said: [...] "This (Italian Marines issue) should not be a matter which affects relationship between the EU and India. This (the EU-India relationship) is something far larger and wider platform to unite. That is why we have expressed disappointment that the summit has been postponed,". Van Orden added: [...] "We attach importance to imprisonment of citizens of our member states. (...) We do respect the Indian legal process, but think the case has taken too long and {{would like to see it}} expedited. Even so, the European parliament would be very concerned if it had any evidence that the EU-India summit delay had anything to do with the case of the marines." [...] Vice Chair, Nina Gill cautioned: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> regrettable if that (Italian Marines) issue played any part in it,". Italy's bid to prevent the case coming to trial in India (by involving the Catholic church, proposing blood money to the victims, and actively stalling legal proceedings) appears to have hardened India's stance.|$|E
