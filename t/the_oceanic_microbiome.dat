5|$|Biomes {{are larger}} units of {{organization}} that categorize {{regions of the}} Earth's ecosystems, mainly according to the structure and composition of vegetation. There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes dominated by different functional types of vegetative communities that are limited in distribution by climate, precipitation, weather and other environmental variables. Biomes include tropical rainforest, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, temperate deciduous forest, taiga, tundra, hot desert, and polar desert. Other researchers have recently categorized other biomes, such as the human and oceanic microbiomes. To a microbe, {{the human body is}} a habitat and a landscape. Microbiomes were discovered largely through advances in molecular genetics, which have revealed a hidden richness of microbial diversity on the planet. <b>The</b> <b>oceanic</b> <b>microbiome</b> plays {{a significant role in the}} ecological biogeochemistry of the planet's oceans.|$|E

50|$|The overall {{shape of}} ridges results from Pratt isostacy: {{close to the}} ridge axis there is hot, low-density mantle {{supporting}} <b>the</b> <b>oceanic</b> crust.

Thus older seafloor is underlain by denser material and 'sits' lower.

40|$|Spatial {{variations}} in the stress drop for 1726 intermediate-depth intraslab earthquakes were examined in the subducting Pacific plate beneath Hokkaido, using precisely relocated hypocenters, the corner frequencies of events, and detailed determined geometry of the upper interface of the Pacific plate. The results show that median stress drop for intraslab earthquakes generally increases {{with an increase in}} depth from approximate to 10 to 157 Mpa at depths of 70 - 300 km. More specifically, median stress drops for events in <b>the</b> <b>oceanic</b> crust decrease (9. 9 - 6. 8 MPa) at depths of 70 - 120 km and increase (6. 8 - 17 MPa) at depths of 120 - 170 km, whereas median stress drop for events in <b>the</b> <b>oceanic</b> mantle decrease (21. 6 - 14. 0 MPa) at depths of 70 - 170 km, where the geometry of the Pacific plate is well determined. The increase in stress drop with depth in <b>the</b> <b>oceanic</b> crust at depths of 120 - 170 km, for which several studies have shown an increase in velocity, can be explained by an increase in the velocity and a decrease in the water content due to the phase boundary with dehydration in <b>the</b> <b>oceanic</b> crust. Stress drops for events in <b>the</b> <b>oceanic</b> mantle were larger than those for events in <b>the</b> <b>oceanic</b> crust at depths of 70 - 120 km.

30|$|We {{studied the}} effect of <b>the</b> <b>oceanic</b> water layer on strong ground motion simulations. Source faults of {{subduction}} zone earthquakes, such as the Nankai-Tonankai earthquake, West Japan, are situated in the offshore area, under a thick water layer. The necessity of including <b>the</b> <b>oceanic</b> water layer in the velocity model for simulations employing the finite difference method is debated by many researchers, and consideration given {{to the possibility of}} neglecting by this layer, which would reduce the computation time and stabilize the calculations. Although <b>the</b> <b>oceanic</b> water layer has a low velocity and density, it can affect surface wave generation. In this study, for demonstration purposes, we calculated and compared strong ground motions from three source fault models, placed into the boundary between the crust and subducting plate, where source rupture of the Tonankai earthquake is expected. Simulations were made for two realistic three-dimensional velocity models: without and with <b>the</b> <b>oceanic</b> water layer. <b>The</b> model without <b>the</b> <b>oceanic</b> water layer was constructed simply by subtracting the depth of <b>the</b> <b>oceanic</b> layer from <b>the</b> depth of all velocity interfaces under the ocean. This procedure keeps the thickness of <b>the</b> layers (<b>oceanic</b> sediments, surface low-velocity layer, upper crust, and lower crust) the same as in the model with <b>the</b> <b>oceanic</b> layer and reduces simulation errors. Simulations were made for the set of sites on a line across the subduction zone and directed to the Osaka basin. The results show that the water layer has a strong effect on the fundamental mode of the Rayleigh wave, which can be generated by the shallow (approx. 5 km) source. Considering that all asperities of the expected Nankai-Tonankai earthquake are deep (> 10 km), we conclude that {{the effect of}} the water layer can be neglected for ground motions at land sites.|$|R
