5|$|One {{group of}} Corregidor prisoners, before first {{entering}} the camp, had each hidden {{a piece of}} a radio under their clothing, to later be reassembled into a working device. When the Japanese had an American radio technician fix their radios, he stole parts. The prisoners thus had several radios to listen to newscasts on radio stations as far away as San Francisco, allowing the POWs <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> status of the war. A smuggled camera was used to document the camp's living conditions. Prisoners also constructed weapons and smuggled ammunition into the camp for the possibility of securing a handgun.|$|E

25|$|In July 1810, {{shortly before}} {{completion}} of the lines, Fletcher left the fortifications to serve alongside Wellington once more in the field, and was thus at the Battle of Buçaco (27 September 1810) where he again distinguished himself and was mentioned in dispatches. Wellington fell back to the Lines of Torres Vedras in October 1810, pursued by Marshal Masséna, who was shocked to find such extensive defences, having been promised by Portuguese rebels that the road to Lisbon was an easy one. Wellington's superiors were equally surprised <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> defences when they later received his report. After an unsuccessful attack on 18 October, Masséna initially retreated to Santarém but when his supplies ran out the following March, he abandoned any thoughts of another attempt and headed north.|$|E

Foot soldiers received 520 pieces each, horse riders the double amount, captains 2080 pieces, generals 3640 and some pieces were given as prizes for the most distinguished soldiers.

[...] She wrote that her friends kept recommending the book to her, even after she had tried starting it. She eventually decided that the reason she didn't like the book was her own selfishness in seeking to fulfill her own desires rather than leaving her desires for God to work out. She then read the book again, and wrote that God used her reading of it to make her thankful for her time as a single person. She also wrote that she found the book to be [...] "mostly about letting God's love overflow into all areas of your life rather than tales of perfect Christian couples." ...|$|E

In the end of July, Boxleitner stated he frequently heard about the pre-production of Tron 3 while shooting Cedar Cove in Vancouver, and was disappointed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> cancellation.

2500|$|Leone {{built upon}} the screenwriter's {{original}} concept to [...] "show {{the absurdity of}} war... the Civil War which the characters encounter. In my frame of reference, it is useless, stupid: it does not involve a 'good cause.'" [...] An avid history buff, Leone said, [...] "I had read somewhere that 120,000 people died in Southern camps such as Andersonville. I was not ignorant {{of the fact that}} there were camps in the North. You always get <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> shameful behavior of the losers, never the winners." [...] The Batterville Camp where Blondie and Tuco are imprisoned was based on steel engravings of Andersonville. Many shots in the film were influenced by archival photographs taken by Mathew Brady. As the film took place during the Civil War, it served as a prequel for the other two films in the trilogy, which took place after the war.|$|E

[...] "How do we define ourselves within a cultural context that wants to reduce complex realities to simplistic clichés?" [...] he asked rhetorically. He told the online journal Inside Higher Ed: [...] "We are, I think, {{a different kind of}} Christian... If [...] assume they’re going to find at EMU what they would also find at Liberty University [...] they’re not going to be very happy here. They’re going to run into it headlong. They’re going <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> peace tradition. They’re going to hear a lot of language {{about what it means to}} be a follower of Jesus in this world. From our perspective, that means less nationalism, and a much more global perspective, care for creation. What they would find here is a concern for personal piety … but we’re not willing to stop there because we also believe that the New Testament is pretty clear that there is a social dimension to what Jesus called us to be and to do.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1920s, York {{formed the}} Alvin C. York Foundation {{with the mission}} of {{increasing}} educational opportunities in his region of Tennessee. Board members included the area's congressman, Cordell Hull, who later became Secretary of State under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Secretary of the Treasury William G. McAdoo, and Tennessee Governor Albert Roberts. Plans called for a non-sectarian institution providing vocational training {{to be called the}} York Agricultural Institute. York concentrated on fund-raising, though he disappointed audiences who wanted <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Argonne when he instead explained that [...] "I occupied one space in a fifty mile front. I saw so little it hardly seems worthwhile discussing it. I'm trying to forget the war {{in the interest of the}} mountain boys and girls that I grew up among." [...] He fought first to win financial support from the state and county, then battled local leaders about the school's location. Refusing to compromise, he resigned and developed plans for a rival York Industrial School. After a series of lawsuits he gained control of the original institution and was its president when it opened in December 1929. As the Great Depression deepened, the state government failed to provide promised funds, and York mortgaged his farm to fund bus transportation for students. Even after he was ousted as president in 1936 by political and bureaucratic rivals, he continued to donate money.|$|E
