5|$|The {{computer}} console {{explosion that}} causes the transporter malfunction was simulated using brillo pads. Weldon hid steel wool inside the console and attached an arc welder to operate by remote control when the actor pulled a wire. The welder was designed to create a spark instead of actually welding, causing the steel wool to burn and make sparks; so effective was the setup that the cast members were continually startled by the flare-ups, resulting in additional takes. Various canisters and cargo containers appear to be suspended by Anti-gravity throughout the film. These effects were executed by several of Weldon's assistants. The crew built a circular track that had the same shape as the corridor and suspended the antigravity prop on four small wires that connected to the track. <b>The</b> <b>wires</b> were treated with a special acid which oxidized the metal; the reaction tarnished <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> to a dull gray that would not {{show up in the}} deep blue corridor lighting.

40|$|AbstractThe {{high-speed}} and medium-speed wire {{electrical discharge machines}} {{which are}} originally developed in China are playing {{an important role in}} mold making. However, <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> electrode wear is a universal problem in the machining process because <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> electrode is used repeatedly. Considering the relative motion between <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> electrode and <b>the</b> workpiece, the heat transfer model of wire electrode under moving heat source was established, and the temperature field of wire electrode was simulated in single pulse discharge by FEM. The results indicated that the size of the melted zone along <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> electrode axial direction increased remarkably while the depth size, the width size and the volume of the melted zone reduced apparently when <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> running speed increased. It can be concluded that the high relative speed between <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> electrode and <b>the</b> workpiece is beneficial to reduce <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> electrode wear in radial direction. Furthermore, when <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> running speed is higher than a certain value, the discharge column will slide over <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> electrode surface before <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> material reaches its melting point, thus the melting and ablation of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> electrode material does not happen, which can almost realize no wire electrode wear...|$|R

5|$|For {{landings}} and take-offs, wire flying riggings were devised and used. On location, {{these were}} suspended from tower cranes, {{whereas in the}} studio elaborate rigs were suspended from the studio ceilings. Some of the wire-flying work was quite audacious considering computer-controlled rigs were not then available—the penultimate shot where Superman flies out of the prison yard for example. Although stuntmen were used, Reeve did {{much of the work}} himself, and was suspended as high as 50feet in the air. Counterweights and pulleys were typically used to achieve flying movement, rather than electronic or motorized devices. The thin wires used to suspend Reeve were typically removed from the film in post-production using rotoscope techniques, although this wasn't necessary in all shots (in certain lighting conditions or when Superman is very distant in the frame, <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> were more or less imperceptible).|$|E
50|$|For example, if two <b>wires</b> {{carrying}} <b>the</b> same {{alternating current}} lie parallel to one another, {{as would be}} found in a coil used in an inductor or transformer, the magnetic field of one wire will induce longitudinal eddy currents in <b>the</b> adjacent <b>wire,</b> that flow in long loops along <b>the</b> <b>wire,</b> in <b>the</b> same direction as the main current on the side of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> facing away from <b>the</b> other <b>wire,</b> and back in the opposite direction on the side of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> facing <b>the</b> other <b>wire.</b> Thus <b>the</b> eddy current will reinforce the main current on the side facing away from <b>the</b> first <b>wire,</b> and oppose <b>the</b> main current on the side facing <b>the</b> first <b>wire.</b> <b>The</b> net effect is to redistribute the current in the cross section of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> into a thin strip on the side facing away from <b>the</b> other <b>wire.</b> Since <b>the</b> current is concentrated into a smaller area of <b>the</b> <b>wire,</b> <b>the</b> resistance is increased.|$|R

5|$|The {{land where}} the Glidden House stands once held a log structure, which Glidden lived {{in when he}} first came to DeKalb at the beckoning of his cousin Russell Huntley. The house was built in 1861 for barbed wire {{entrepreneur}} Joseph Farwell Glidden. As his personal residence, the house, and its accompanying barn, were closely associated with his invention, really just an improvement, of barbed wire. Glidden's improvement upon a wire board fence developed by Henry Rose was of vast importance in the settlement of the United States west of the Mississippi. It was after Glidden saw Rose exhibit his wire at a fair in 1873 that he was struck with the idea of attaching barbs to wire strand fencing. Glidden is said to have experimented with some of his ideas in the basement kitchen of the Glidden House. He noticed that whenever he tried to attach s directly to strands of wire they slid {{along the length of the}} wire; Glidden realized he needed a way to crimp the barbs. He began tinkering around the home's kitchen. Glidden fit two hair pins to the shaft of a coffee mill, one centered and the other off-center. He found that by placing the wire between the pins and turning the crank a uniform barb resulted. How to crimp the barbs to the wire was solved, in the barn, by tying one end of the wire and another length of wire to a poplar tree on the grounds of the Glidden House and the other ends of <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> to a grindstone. The grindstone was used to twist <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> together and prevent the barbs from slipping.|$|E
5|$|Birdy was {{the first}} feature film to be {{partially}} shot with the Skycam, a computer-controlled, cable-suspended camera system created by Garrett Brown, inventor of the Steadicam. The Skycam had 100-foot high posts with four hanging wires controlled by a computer, and a lightweight Panavision camera with 200 feet of film hung {{at the center of}} <b>the</b> <b>wires.</b> The filmmakers intended to use the Skycam to fully depict Birdy's point of view during a fantasy sequence in which he imagines himself flying. However, they encountered difficulties with the Skycam, which would often malfunction. Although the Skycam proved successful on its first take, Parker insisted that the filmed footage be shot more rapidly. However, the camera system malfunctioned during its second take, after capturing 40 seconds of footage. This resulted in the camera operators shooting the remainder of the sequence with a Steadicam mounted on top of an improvised camera dolly.|$|E
50|$|A {{hot wire}} {{mass airflow sensor}} determines the mass of air flowing into the engine’s air intake system. The theory of {{operation}} of <b>the</b> hot <b>wire</b> mass airflow sensor {{is similar to that}} of <b>the</b> hot <b>wire</b> anemometer (which determines air velocity). This is achieved by heating a <b>wire</b> suspended in <b>the</b> engine’s air stream, like a toaster wire, with either a constant voltage over <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> or a constant current through <b>the</b> <b>wire.</b> <b>The</b> <b>wire's</b> electrical resistance increases as <b>the</b> <b>wire’s</b> temperature increases, which varies the electrical current flowing through the circuit, according to Ohm's law. When air flows past <b>the</b> <b>wire,</b> <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> cools, decreasing its resistance, which in turn allows more current to flow through the circuit, since the supply voltage is a constant. As more current flows, <b>the</b> <b>wire’s</b> temperature increases until the resistance reaches equilibrium again. The current increase or decrease is proportional to the mass of air flowing past <b>the</b> <b>wire.</b> <b>The</b> integrated electronic circuit converts the proportional measurement into a calibrated signal which is sent to the ECU.|$|R
40|$|The {{dependence}} of the magnetic properties of amorphous <b>wire</b> on <b>the</b> diameter have been investigated.

50|$|These {{unpredictable}} circumstances may {{be prevented}} or counteracted {{at the beginning}} of the winding by forcing <b>the</b> <b>wire,</b> meaning, every single winding of the first layer on the inner coil diameter, into a predefined position. <b>The</b> <b>wire</b> places itself into a prefabricated groove geometry of the coil body and <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> guide does not need to follow it exactly but only approximately. Since <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> always loses in cross-sectional area due to <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> drawing to be used and the necessary deflections (mechanical stresses under tensile load) during winding, the distance between the grooves is designed only for <b>the</b> max. possible <b>wire</b> diameter. Effects of bends and tolerances of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> and <b>the</b> coil body as well as changing surface qualities can be avoided that way. Especially wire bends that develop due to wire deflections caused by, e.g., pulleys, wire eyelets or even <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> guiding nozzle itself within <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> feeder of a winding machine can lead to deformations that remain on the winding of a coil. Applying grooves to the winding basis supports the layer-accurate position of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> during <b>the</b> winding process. This behavior isparticularly beneficial for the winding processes where a plastic deformation of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> is unavoidable immediately before the depositing of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> onto <b>the</b> winding basis. This behavior can be observed especially in the needle winding technology. Due to physical reasons, it is unavoidable that <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> leaves <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> guiding nozzle at an angle of approx. 90°. Therefore, mechanical tensions remain inside <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> that are visible in the form of a bent winding on the winding basis. As a result, the following windings or also the following layers can change in their desired position.|$|R

5|$|Jaffe {{noted that}} the low-tech method of {{suspending}} actors by wires helped the final effect, because as photographed by John Fante, few wires {{had to be removed}} digitally in post-production; sets were constructed so that the harsh lighting obscured wires, and entire sets were constructed on their sides so that by pulling actors {{up and down on the}} rotated sets, the characters appeared to float sideways. These sets were on gimbals so that the movement of the actors and sets created a floating effect. The shot of two Klingons killed and thrown back down a corridor by phaser blasts was simulated by positioning the camera at the bottom of a corridor set. The set was placed on its end in the tallest soundstage at Paramount, so that the camera looked up towards the ceiling.

5|$|Ten of {{the eleven}} gliders {{transporting}} Group Concrete landed next to the Vroenhoven bridge at 05:15, the eleventh glider having been hit by anti-aircraft fire {{en route to the}} bridge and being forced to land prematurely inside Dutch territory.

The rest of the gliders landed without damage. One of the gliders landed near to the fortification housing the bridge detonators. This allowed the airborne troops to rapidly assault the position. They killed the occupants and tore out <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> connecting the explosives to the detonator set, ensuring the bridge could not be destroyed. The remaining Belgian defenders resisted fiercely by mounting several counter-attacks in an attempt to recapture the bridge. They were repelled with the aid of several machine-guns dropped by parachute to the airborne troops at 06:15. Constant Belgian attacks meant that Group Concrete were not withdrawn and relieved by an infantry battalion until 21:40. They suffered losses of seven dead and twenty-four wounded.|$|E

5|$|After {{commissioning}} {{too late}} {{to participate in the}} First World War, Argus was tasked to conduct deck-landing trials with longitudinal arresting gear transferred from Furious. The first landing on the ship was made on 1 October 1918 by a Sopwith Ship Strutter. The same month, the ship was used in trials to evaluate the effects which an island superstructure would have on flying operations, with a canvas-and-wood dummy island being installed with a smoke box to simulate funnel gases. By 19 December, 36 successful landings had been made by Ship Strutters and Sopwith Pups. Argus was refitted from 23 December to 21 March 1919 with modified arresting gear. <b>The</b> <b>wires</b> of the arresting gear had been lifted off the deck so they could engage the hooks on the undercarriages of the aircraft, but this prevented the use of the flight deck for any other purpose. The after lift was therefore lowered , which allowed aircraft to use the area when the lift was raised flush {{with the rest of the}} flight deck. Trials began in April and the lift was widened in October. Argus joined the Atlantic Fleet in January 1920 for its Spring Cruise carrying eight Ship Strutters, four Sopwith Camel fighters, two Airco DH.9A bombers and two Fairey floatplanes. Operational experience confirmed that the aircraft should attempt to land directly onto the arresting gear lest they be blown over the side of the carrier, as happened three times during the cruise.|$|E
