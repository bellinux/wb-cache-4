5|$|Although Spiderland was {{not widely}} {{recognized}} on its initial release, it eventually {{sold more than}} 50,000 copies and became a landmark album in underground music after Slint broke up.

In 2005, 2007 and 2013–2014, Slint reunited for a tour consisting of performances of Spiderland in its entirety.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} {{a wide range of}} {{attachment}} difficulties within <b>the</b> <b>styles</b> which may result in emotional disturbance and increase the risk of later psychopathologies, particularly the disorganized style, none of <b>the</b> <b>styles</b> constitute a disorder in themselves and none equate to criteria for RAD as such. A disorder in the clinical sense is a condition requiring treatment, as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. Reactive attachment disorder denotes a lack of typical attachment behaviors rather than an attachment style, however problematic that style may be, in that there is an unusual lack of discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar people in both forms of the disorder. Such discrimination does exist as a feature of the social behavior of children with atypical attachment styles. Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 depict the disorder in terms of socially aberrant behavior in general rather than focusing more specifically on attachment behaviors as such. DSM-IV emphasizes a failure to initiate or respond to social interactions across a range of relationships and ICD-10 similarly focuses on contradictory or ambivalent social responses that extend across social situations. The relationship between patterns of attachment in the Strange Situation and RAD is not yet clear.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{homogeneity}} of ancient Egyptian art, <b>the</b> <b>styles</b> of particular {{times and places}} sometimes reflected changing cultural or political attitudes. After {{the invasion of the}} Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period, Minoan-style frescoes were found in Avaris. The most striking example of a politically driven change in artistic forms comes from the Amarna period, where figures were radically altered to conform to Akhenaten's revolutionary religious ideas. This style, known as Amarna art, was quickly and thoroughly erased after Akhenaten's death and replaced by the traditional forms.|$|E

The two decided to create a film that combined <b>the</b> <b>styles</b> of both. After graduation, Myrick and Sánchez, along with Gregg Hale, Robin Cowie, and Michael Monello started the production company Haxan Films, derived from Benjamin Christensen's 1922 Swedish-Danish silent documentary horror film Häxan, whose English-language title is Witchcraft Through the Ages.|$|E

After Johnson's retirement, Marcus's invitations were among the few the former president and his wife continued to accept.

Hergé abandoned painting shortly after, having produced 37 paintings in all.|$|E

During pre-production, the band listened to styles and ideas that, according to Butler, changed the way {{they looked at the}} songs they had initially written. <b>The</b> <b>styles</b> were their most expansive to date, and came from the diversity of their members: Butler had involved himself in the punk rock skateboarding culture when he was eleven, but had also been influenced by his father, who was in a soul band.|$|E

5|$|The band {{gradually}} rebuilt {{their musical}} and songwriting confidence during these rehearsals {{during the summer}} of 1979, with <b>the</b> <b>styles</b> of the session's early cover songs setting the template for the diverse material that would be written for London Calling. The band were also encouraged by a growing appreciation of drummer Topper Headon's drumming skills, which they realised could be used to perform music in a wide array of genres and styles beyond punk rock. The Clash wrote and recorded demos, with Mick Jones composing and arranging much of the music and Joe Strummer generally writing the lyrics.|$|E
