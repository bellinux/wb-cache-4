40|$|Most {{agricultural}} products are produced on farms {{where there is}} a mix of activities, resulting in a range of co-products. This raises the issue of how best to model these complex production systems for Life Cycle Assessment, especially where there are benefits imparted by one activity in the mixed farming system to another. On the mixed farm studied, there were significant <b>two-way</b> <b>reference</b> flows (representing 288 t CO 2 -e/year or 10 % of the total farm emissions) between activities producing distinct products (wool, meat, grain) and these were modelled using system expansion. Cropping and sheep activities were modelled as separate sub-processes in the farming system, with unique inputs and outputs identified for each. Co-production from the sheep activity was modelling using allocation, comparing biophysical and economic relationships. Using an economic allocation resulted in different estimates of global warming impact for sheep co-products, with figures varying by 7 - 52 %. When compared to biophysical allocation, economic allocation shifted the environmental burden to the higher value co-products and away from the high resource use products. Using economic allocation, for every kilogram of wool produced there was an estimated 28. 7 kg of CO 2 -e emitted. Amongst the live animal products, the stud rams had the highest estimated carbon footprint (719 kg CO 2 -e/ram). Amongst the crops, estimates of emissions for the cereal grains averaged 202 kg CO 2 -e/tonne grain, canola 222 kg CO 2 -e/tonne and lupins 510 kg CO 2 -e/tonne, when modelled to include the benefits of the mixed farming system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Distributed Object Oriented Databases require class fragmentation, {{performed}} either horizontally or vertically. Complex class relationships like aggregation and/or association {{are often}} represented as <b>two-way</b> <b>references</b> or object-links between classes. In {{order to obtain}} a good quality horizontal fragmentation, an optimal class processing order is needed. We present in this paper a new technique for establishing an order for class fragmentation. We improve fragmentation quality by capturing the semantic of input queries {{in the context of}} the aggregation hierarchy. 1...|$|R

Next it considers {{the types of}} cross references contained in a document {{and how they can}} be mapped into the links that integrate disparate independent hierarchical documents into a seamless directed graph universe of text. Next comes a discussion of how to accommodate multiple versions of a document, <b>two-way</b> <b>references</b> and footnotes. This is followed by a consideration of two access methods: cumulative index and boolean query. Finally we look at texts which help the lawyer create an original document: precedent books for drafting...|$|R
5000|$|Resource links are a {{category}} of links, which can be either one-way or <b>two-way,</b> usually <b>referenced</b> as [...] "Resources" [...] or [...] "Information" [...] in navbars, but sometimes, especially in the early, less compartmentalized years of the Web, simply called [...] "links". Basically, they are hyperlinks to a website or a specific webpage containing content believed to be beneficial, useful and relevant to visitors of the site establishing the link.|$|R
50|$|The APIC is a split {{architecture}} design, {{with a local}} component (LAPIC) usually {{integrated into}} the processor itself, and an optional I/O APIC on a system bus. The first APIC was the 82489DX it was a discrete chip that functioned both as local and I/O APIC. The 82489DX enabled construction of symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) systems with the Intel 486 and early Pentium processors; for example, the <b>reference</b> <b>two-way</b> 486 SMP system used three 82489DX chips, two as local APICs and one as I/O APIC. Starting with the P54C processor, the local APIC functionality was integrated into the Intel processors' silicon. The first dedicated I/O APIC was the Intel 82093AA, which was intended for PIIX3-based systems.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Ultrasound imaging is a {{successful}} modality in a broad variety of diagnostic applications including trauma. Ultrasound {{has been shown to}} be accurate when performed by non-radiologist physicians; recent reports have suggested that non-physicians can perform limited ultrasound examinations. A multipurpose ultrasound system is installed on the International Space Station (ISS) as a component of the Human Research Facility (HRF). This report documents the first ocular ultrasound examination conducted in space, which demonstrated the capability to assess physiologic alterations or pathology including trauma during long-duration space flight. METHODS: An ISS crewmember with minimal sonography training was remotely guided by an imaging expert from Mission Control Center (MCC) through a comprehensive ultrasound examination of the eye. A multipurpose ultrasound imager was used in conjunction with a space-to-ground video downlink and <b>two-way</b> audio. <b>Reference</b> cards with topological reference points, hardware controls, and target images were used to facilitate the examination. Multiple views of the eye structures were obtained through a closed eyelid. Pupillary response to light was demonstrated by modifying the light exposure of the contralateral eye. RESULTS: A crewmember on the ISS was able to complete a comprehensive ocular examination using B- and M-mode ultrasonography with remote guidance from an expert in the MCC. Multiple anteroposterior, oblique, and coronal views of the eye clearly demonstrated the anatomic structures of both segments of the globe. The iris and pupil were readily visualized with probe manipulation. Pupillary diameter was assessed in real time in B- and M-mode displays. The anatomic detail and fidelity of ultrasound video were excellent and could be used to answer a variety of clinical and space physiologic questions. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive, high-quality ultrasound examination of the eye was performed with a multipurpose imager aboard the ISS by a non-expert operator using remote guidance. Ocular ultrasound images were of diagnostic quality despite the 2 -second communication latency and the unconventional setting of a weightless spacecraft environment. The remote guidance techniques developed to facilitate this successful NASA research experiment will support wider applications of ultrasound for remote medicine on Earth including the assessment of pupillary reactions in patients with severe craniofacial trauma and swelling...|$|R
40|$|Kelp {{forests are}} a very {{productive}} marine ecosystem with high species diversity found {{in many parts of}} the world, including off the coast of California. As a consequence, they are a major contributor to atmospheric carbon sequestration (storage) on the North American Pacific Coast. However, many kelp forests have been destroyed by the overpopulation of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (purple sea urchin), which reduce kelp growth, productivity, and species diversity (urchin barrens). The rocky reefs along the southern end of the Santa Monica Bay contain 61. 5 hectares of urchin barrens. Organizations are working to remove the urchins and restore kelp forests and monitor the outcome as part of the Palos Verdes Kelp Forest Restoration Project (KFRP). Using this monitoring data, we asked the following questions: (1) has fish species richness increased significantly from the pre- to the post-restoration period? and (2) how much carbon is being stored among the animal life in the pre-restoration period compared to the post-restoration period? Three designation areas were considered: restored kelp forests, urchin barrens (control), existing kelp forests (<b>reference).</b> <b>Two-way</b> ANOVA was used to assess fish species richness. Carbon storage among animal life was calculated by estimating the total biomass of invertebrate and fish species within the three designation areas. Results showed that from the pre-restoration year to the post-restoration year fish species richness increases significantly at all three designation sites. Changes in total biomass of animal life were not statistically significant. While changes were observed, there was wide variability due to small sample sizes for each designation area (N= 2). Further data collection and analysis are needed to distinguish if increases are due to KFRP activity or other sources of variation. Further study will determine whether or not the KFRP’s efforts have been effective and can serve as an intervention model for restoring other kelp forests...|$|R
