25|$|The 36th Battalion {{was raised}} at Broadmeadow Camp, in Newcastle, New South Wales, in February 1916 {{as part of}} an {{expansion}} of the First Australian Imperial Force, which occurred after the Gallipoli Campaign. The bulk of the battalion's recruits came from New South Wales rifle clubs and along with the 33rd, 34th and 35th Battalions, it formed the 9th Brigade, attached to the 3rd Division. The battalion left Sydney shortly on 13 May 1916, bound for the United Kingdom. Arriving in early July 1916, the battalion spent the next four months in training, before taking up a position on the Western Front on 4 December 1916, in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> out an uncomfortable winter in the trenches.|$|E
25|$|The {{memorial}} {{was unveiled}} by Lieutenant General Sir Henry de Beauvoir De Lisle on 25 April 1922, using the novel {{method of pressing}} an electric button. The remaining funds were spent on drums and bugles for the regiment and donated to the Lancashire Fusiliers' compassionate fund. After the Lancashire Fusiliers were amalgamated into the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers in 1968, the memorial {{was adopted by the}} new regiment and rededicated to all fusiliers killed in action. It originally sat outside the Lancashire Fusiliers' headquarters in Wellington Barracks but the barracks closed in the 1970s and the memorial was relocated. It was relocated again in 2009, this <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in a public park renamed Gallipoli Gardens, outside the Fusilier Museum, which moved at the same time. The memorial was designated a grade II listed building in 1992. It was upgraded to grade II* in 2015 (on the centenary of the Cape Helles landing), along with two other memorials related to the Gallipoli Campaign; later that year it formed part of a national collection of Lutyens' war memorials.|$|E

25|$|A {{government}} decree of March 1982 {{sought to}} provide greater employment {{security for the}} increasing number of workers on part-time and fixed-term contracts by restricting the circumstances in which employers could use such labour (this was largely to ensure that permanent employees were not displaced by cheaper and more easily dismissed part-time workers). The law set out to ensure that such workers receive the same benefits as full-time workers and trade unions were given statutory rights to institute legal proceedings against employers or temporary work agencies if the provisions of the new law were evaded. That same year, the government passed legislation to ensure the full, legal eligibility of women for all civil service posts and an active policy was adopted to encourage them to come forward for promotion. In 1981, legislation was passed which permitted the establishment of local private radio stations. In March 1982, a “Special Statute” was granted to Corsica, which set the territory apart legally from other regions and provided it with additional state subsidies and greater autonomy over cultural, social, economic, and educational policies. Various measures were also introduced to improve conditions for migrants. A new drive began in 1981 to encourage local authorities to establish programmes including literacy programmes, housing schemes, and the setting up of young people’s and women’s groups, and in 1983 France ratified the Council of Europe’s Convention on the Legal Status of Migrant Workers. The Association Law of 1981 allowed foreigners {{for the first time to}} form associations in France under the same rules that governed citizens, and these new immigrant associations were thereafter eligible to receive public funding. New policies removed the French language requirements of immigrants to run for seats in employee institutions, and foreign workers became eligible for the first <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on important industrial relations councils known as the Conseils des Prud’hommes. In 1982, an existing programme to assist the repatriation of Algerian nationals was replaced by a system offering a choice between vocational training, assistance to set up a small business and a repatriation grant.|$|E
25|$|With the {{multiple}} stoppages in qualifying, the third session was expanded by {{half an hour}} {{in order to give}} teams more time on the circuit. Fifteen minutes into the session Nakajima set a new fastest time of three minutes and 21.789 seconds and would hold the top of the time charts to take Toyota's first pole position at Le Mans since 1999. Dumas improved the No. 14 Porsche's <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> alongside the Toyota on the front row of the grid. Audi was not able to improve on their times from the second qualifying session, and settled for fifth, sixth, and seventh places on the grid. The No. 12 Rebellion, driven by Beche, won out over its sister car in the LMP1-L category but eight seconds off the overall pole position. In LMP2, OAK Racing and the Jota Zytek traded provisional pole before Gommendy reclaimed the top spot for TDS Racing and Ligier with a three minutes and 37.609 seconds lap time. Bruni improved on his own provisional pole time in LMGTE Pro with a three minutes and 53.700 seconds, extending the class lead by over a second from the No. 73 Corvette in second and sole Aston Martin in third. Sam Bird earned AF Corse a second pole position by improving LMGTE Am's top time by two seconds with a three minutes and 54.665 seconds and setting the second fastest time of all LMGTE cars combined. Aston Martin's two entries were second and third in the class, yet a full second behind the Ferrari. The Nissan ZEOD RC of Lucas Ordóñez, after earlier woes in the week, set a three minutes and 50.185 seconds lap time to place 27th overall in qualifying. The slow zone procedure was used {{for the first time in}} the third qualifying session, after Montecalvo spun the 8 Star Ferrari into the gravel in the Porsche Curves. The slow zone was required once more to finish the session after Chandhok crashed the Murphy Oreca at Indianapolis. Both slow zones prevented qualifying times from being improved in the final hour of the session.|$|E

500|$|In 1925 Brooks had solo {{exhibitions}} in Paris, London, and New York. There {{is no evidence}} to substantiate the claim that Brooks ceased painting after 1925. [...] While in New York during the '30s she produced portraits of Carl Van Vechten in 1936 Mureal Draper in 1938 that we know of. [...] We know that she purchased paints in WWII when she and Natalie were trapped in Florence. [...] As researchers, we know from photographs that there are lost works by Brooks still to be rediscovered. [...] After that year she produced only four more paintings, including portraits of Carl Van Vechten in 1936 and Muriel Draper in 1938. [...] Moreover, Brooks did complete what previous scholars thought to be her last portrait at the age of 87 in 1961. [...] The artist stated that she had drawn all her life so {{there is no reason to}} assume she was not doing so by the time McAvoy painted her portrait. [...] In fact, she herself says in her audio interview from 1968 that she was miffed by the fact that McAvoy portrait of her showed a bunch of dried up brushes rather than the glass table she used as a palette [...] "As if I didn't paint." [...] Her comments seem to indicate she was anything but dried up as a painter. [...] In fact, she had intended to paint a portrait of McAvoy but he never had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> for her.

2500|$|In the mid-1990s, Campbell {{branched}} out {{into other areas}} of the entertainment industry. Her novel Swan, about a supermodel dealing with blackmail, was released in 1994 to poor reviews. It was ghostwritten by Caroline Upcher, with Campbell explaining that she [...] "just did not have the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down and write a book." [...] That same year, she released her album Baby Woman, which was named after designer Rifat Ozbek's nickname for Campbell. Produced by Youth and Tim Simenon, the album was only commercially successful in Japan; it failed to reach the top 75 on the UK charts, while its only single, [...] "Love and Tears", reached No. 40. Baby Woman was mocked by critics, inspiring the Naomi Awards for terrible pop music. In 1995, along with fellow models Schiffer, Turlington and Elle Macpherson, Campbell invested in a chain of restaurants called the Fashion Cafe, whose directors were arrested for fraud, bankruptcy and money laundering in 1998. During this time, Campbell also had small roles in Miami Rhapsody and Spike Lee's Girl 6, as well as a recurring role on the second season of New York Undercover.|$|E

[...] Pierre's lyricism includes a mix of fact and fiction, which is intended to leave the listener guessing. The album's tone is reflective, which was spurred from Pierre having <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> at home to write and think. He looked at his relationship with lead guitarist Joshua Cain, noting that the two had written and played music together for 15 years at that point. Pierre felt [...] "overwhelmed with the eventual demise of everything," [...] and considered the fact that [...] "nothing lasts forever" [...] is one of the album's most important points. Occasionally, Pierre's lyricism was considered too personal or dark by other members. One lyric from [...] "Timelines", paraphrased by Pierre in an interview as [...] "rushing into every pore, the whiskey stench of open sores", was changed to [...] "scattered seeds of sycamore," [...] as Cain found the lyric gross, noting it [...] "literally made [...] stomach sick." ...|$|E

This problem was not solved until the company replaced the top layers of tubes with skylights of angled sheets of fiberglass and specially molded sheets of Plexiglas with painted dark lines to resemble the original joints.

I didn't have any of that baggage to bring with me." [...] Winstone enjoyed working with motion capture, stating that [...] "You were allowed to go, like theater, where you carry a scene on and you become engrossed within the scene.

[...] Unlike some of his castmates, Winstone's animated counterpart bears little resemblance to the actor who was in his early 50s when he filmed the role; Winstone noted that his computer-generated counterpart resembled himself at the age of eighteen, although the filmmakers did not have a photo for reference.
