Carlos Beltrán was the best, at 88.3%. Sharing his {{philosophy}} on stealing bases, he said: [...] "It takes the art of stealing away {{if you do it}} when you're four runs up or four runs down, and the opposing team is just worried about getting outs, not stolen bases. The idea is to steal <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> need them." ...|$|E

2500|$|An award-winning {{article by}} Joyce Tracewell {{describes}} the Electric Mass: [...] "Sun shines through stained glass and colors bounce until the kaleidoscopic vision is suddenly shattered by incredibly swelling music. Smiling musicians with flowery clothes, jeans, long hair, beards and sunglasses play deliberate alien music, {{the kind that}} makes you shiver. It fills {{the room to the}} ceiling pushing against the walls. They sing in voices that should have belonged to Druids or Incas, or Gypsies under a night sky, and you see Jesus smiling at <b>them.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> leave you feel somebody has been dissecting your soul and everything is clearer. And that's what an Electric Mass is." ...|$|E

2500|$|Historian James J. Weingartner sees a {{connection}} between the American mutilation of Japanese war dead and the bombings. According to Weingartner both were partially the result of a dehumanization of the enemy. [...] "he widespread image of the Japanese as sub-human constituted an emotional context which provided another justification for decisions which resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands." [...] On the second day after the bombing of Nagasaki, President Truman had stated: [...] "The only language they seem to understand is the one we have been using to bombard <b>them.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> have to deal with a beast you have to treat him like a beast.

2500|$|By saying Double, the {{competition}} {{will be harder}} because the round scores will be {{twice as much as}} the normal [...] round. The Three means 3 times as much as the normal [...] round and Four means four. The main purposes of saying [...] "Double or Four" [...] is to change the way of playing and increase points, since when the game is doubled (or more) points aren't divided, the team with most points takes all. If you were playing in [...] "locked" [...] "Double or Four", the one who says [...] "Double" [...] or [...] "Four" [...] has the option of locking or opening the Hokom. In case it's locked you can't use the Judged suit as a first card in any trick, you can only use <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> don't have the suit that the other player has played, or don't have any other suit to play as a first card in the trick.
