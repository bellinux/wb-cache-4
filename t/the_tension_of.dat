5|$|Gregson-Williams' {{score is}} darker {{to follow suit}} with the film. Gregson-Williams wanted Caspian's theme to convey a vulnerability, which would sound more vibrant as he became more heroic. It {{originally}} used a 3/4 time signature, but the opening scene required a 4/4 and thus it was changed. To represent Miraz's cunning, the heroic theme from the first film was inverted. For Reepicheep, a muted trumpet was used to present his militaristic and organised character. Gregson-Williams considered arranging his theme for a small pennywhistle, but found that it sounded too cute and broke <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> the night raid.|$|E

5|$|From the Greek {{word for}} pan pipes, σύριγξ, {{it is the}} vocal organ of birds. Located {{at the base of}} a bird's trachea, it {{produces}} sounds without the vocal folds of mammals. The sound is produced by vibrations of some or all of the membrana tympaniformis (the walls of the syrinx) and the pessulus, caused by air flowing through the syrinx. This sets up a self-oscillating system that modulates the airflow creating the sound. The muscles modulate the sound shape by changing <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> the membranes and the bronchial openings. The syrinx enables some species of birds (such as parrots, crows, and mynas) to mimic human speech. Unlike the larynx of mammals, the syrinx is located where the trachea forks into the lungs. Thus, lateralization of bird song is possible and some songbirds can produce more than one sound at a time.|$|E

BBC Radio commentator Peter Jones (who had no access to the television pictures and was relying on information from other people in the press box) also speculated that <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> the result and the night had led to Stein's collapse. Willie Miller, the Scottish captain on the night in the absence of Graeme Souness, was informed by Martin Tyler of ITV Sport during the post-match interview that Stein had collapsed, with Alex Ferguson entering the dressing room to tell them that Stein had suffered a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{were divided}} in their {{opinions}} of the Escape sections. Edge and Wallace thought that the Escape sections were satisfying to solve, while Robinson did not find them fun. Boosinger called them dull and uninspired, but appreciated their connections to the game's mathematical and scientific themes. Several reviewers noted that the controls for both the Nintendo 3DS and the PlayStation Vita were awkward and oversensitive, and Molie L. Patterson of Electronic Gaming Monthly found the limited camera movement disappointing as well. Kemps commented that the user interface was improved from Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors. Many reviewers praised the flowchart for not forcing the player to replay previously completed sections or restart the game from the beginning, but Boosinger and Edge criticized it for removing <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> making wrong decisions.|$|E
40|$|Humic {{substances}} {{are able}} to reduce <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> their solutions and thus can act as surface-active substances in the natural environment, which may have industrial application. The ability to influence <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> humic acid solutions depends {{on the origin of}} the humic acids. The objective of this study was comparison of the ability of humic acids of different origin (soil, water, peat, lignite etc.) to influence <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> their solutions, and identification of the structural characteristics of peat humic acids that determine their surfactant properties. Industrially produced humic materials demonstrated no or insignificant impact on <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> their solutions. However, humic acids isolated from peat had significant impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> their solutions, acting as weak surfactants. <b>The</b> surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> humic acid solutions decreased with increasing concentration, and depended on solution pH. Using a well-characterised bog profile, the ability to influence <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> peat humic acids was shown to depend on age and humification degree. With increase of the humification degree and age, molecular complexity of humic acids and their ability to influence surface tension decreased; but nevertheless, the impact of the biological precursor (peat-forming bryophytes and plants) could be identified...|$|R

50|$|In general, {{the lower}} <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> a liquid coating, {{the easier it}} will be to form a {{satisfactory}} wet film from it. The difference between <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> a coating and the surface energy of a solid substrate to which a coating is applied affects how the liquid coating flows out over the substrate. It also affects the strength of the adhesive bond between the substrate and the dry film. If for instance, <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coating is higher than <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> substrate, then the coating will not spread out and form a film. As <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> substrate is increased, it will reach a point to where the coating will successfully wet the substrate but have poor adhesion. Continuous increase in <b>the</b> coating surface <b>tension</b> will result in better wetting in film formation and better dry film adhesion.|$|R
5|$|One {{particular}} aspect {{that led}} to disagreement amongst {{the cast and crew}} was the genuine killing of animals. Kerman stormed off the set while the death of the coatimundi was filmed, and Yorke refused to participate in the killing of a pig, which he was originally scripted to execute, leaving the duty to Luca Barbareschi. When it was shot, the squeal of the pig subsequently caused Yorke to botch a long monologue, and retakes were not an option because they had no access to additional pigs. Perry Pirkanen cried after filming the butchering of a turtle, and crew members vomited off camera when a squirrel monkey was killed for the film. Actress Francesca Ciardi also objected to the film's sexual content {{and did not want to}} bare her breasts during the sex scene between her and Carl Yorke. When she refused to comply with Deodato's direction, he dragged her off the set and screamed at her in Italian. She had earlier suggested that she and Yorke actually have sex in the jungle before filming in order to relieve <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> the upcoming scene. When Yorke declined, she grew upset with him, alienating him for the rest of the shoot.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was generally}} well received by reviewers. Famitsu generally praised the gameplay elements. One reviewer found the dual screen and mid-battle save features convenient, {{even though the}} latter diluted <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> battle. Another felt that Shadow Dragon was the best Fire Emblem title to that date. 1UP.com's Kurtis Seid enjoyed the gameplay and strategic elements surrounding character management, but said that the multiplayer options risked upsetting the balance; {{he also noted that}} the inclusion of features for newcomers might alienate hardcore fans. Tom Bramwell, writing for Eurogamer, praised the overall feel of the game, from the dual screen functionality to the battle and character class systems, although noted nothing that elevated the game to new heights, and said that the inclusion of newcomer-friendly mechanics clashed with the permanent death mechanic. Shiva Stella of GameSpot enjoyed the tactical elements, openness to newcomers and multiplayer elements; but found the weakness of new recruits and map restrictions detracted from the experience. IGN's Daemon Hatfield, while again noting a lack of innovation, found {{it one of the most}} balanced strategy games available at the time. Stuart Reddick of Nintendo Life greatly enjoyed the gameplay experience and praised the developer's efforts at balancing the various elements, but noted that it felt dated compared to both later Fire Emblem titles and other recent titles within the genre. Fred Dutton of Official Nintendo Magazine was highly positive, praising the classic gameplay, new features, and multiplayer functions. His one major complaint was a lack of innovation.|$|E

30|$|The {{research}} on surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> TiO 2 –H 2 O nanofluids {{is much less}} than that of thermal conductivity or viscosity. Some results showed that adding TiO 2 nanoparticles had little effect on <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> nanofluids. Liu et al. [125] prepared TiO 2 –H 2 O nanofluids whose particle size ranged from 11 to 50  nm and <b>the</b> surface <b>tensions</b> TiO 2 –H 2 O nanofluids were investigated experimentally. They found <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> had no obvious change with the increase in particle loading because <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> nanofluids (1 % mass fraction) increased only 1.6 % compared with deionized water. Hu et al. [126] found <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> TiO 2 –H 2 O nanofluids increases slightly when adding nanoparticles. And <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> decreased as an increase in temperature. Buschmann and Franzke [127] found that no obvious variation occurs when adding a high-volume fraction (5  vol.%) of TiO 2 nanoparticles in water. Tian and Wang [128] measured <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> TiO 2 –water nanofluids by Jolly balance and abruption method. They found that <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> behavior <b>of</b> TiO 2 –water nanofluid was the same as water viz. <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> decreased as <b>the</b> temperature increases. However, <b>the</b> variation <b>of</b> surface <b>tension</b> is related to the content of nanoparticles. When the content of nanoparticles increases rapidly, the decrease rate <b>of</b> surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> TiO 2 –water nanofluids will slow down. Yang et al. [129] observed that nanoparticles have little effect but the surfactant can greatly change <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> nanofluids, when <b>the</b> loading of surfactant is below the critical micelle concentration (CMC). And they explained this appearance as follows: The effect of surfactant on <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> liquid is much greater than that of nanoparticles. When adding nanoparticles into a fluid containing surfactant whose loading is below CMC, the “free” surfactant will be absorbed on the surface of nanoparticles and then immersed in the liquid, which can weaken the reducing effect of surfactant on <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> liquids.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{several types}} of binary nanofluids were {{prepared}} by mixing TiN, SiC, carbon black nanoparticles with emulsifier OP- 10, and Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles with sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS), to ammonia-water solution, respectively. The influences of ammonia, nanoparticles, and surfactant on <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> binary nanofluids are investigated by using a QBZY- 1 digital surface tensiometer. The results show that <b>the</b> surface <b>tensions</b> <b>of</b> ammonia water decrease approximately linearly {{with the increase of}} ammonia content. For the nanofluid (TiN, SiC) without surfactant, the nanoparticles can softly reduce <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> binary nanofluids. While for the nanofluid (Al 2 O 3, carbon black) containning surfactant, the existences of surfactant greatly reduce <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> binary nanofluids. When the content of surfactant is lower than critical micelle concentration(CMC), adding nanoparticles can increase <b>the</b> surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fluids, which may be caused by the decrease of the “free ” surfactant content induced by the adsorption of surfactant on the surface of nanoparticles...|$|R
