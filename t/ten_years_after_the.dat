5|$|In 1981, <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> eastern {{extension}} of Route 37 was canceled, RIDOT began planning studies for a western {{extension of}} the freeway. The expressway was included in a proposal to extend I-84 eastward from Hartford, Connecticut to Providence; more northern alignments for the freeway had been rejected due to concerns of potential damage to the Scituate Reservoir. The southern routing of I-84, which would have utilized Route 37 and terminated in Warwick, largely bypassed the reservoir's watershed. In 1982, however, I-84 was officially canceled by RIDOT after studies indicated that the southern alignment was not a feasible alternative.|$|E

5|$|A {{little over}} <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> first US edition ceased, {{a new version}} appeared, again as a {{companion}} to F. This time the magazine was quarterly. The debut issue was dated May 1969, and it was edited by Edward L. Ferman—son of Joseph Ferman—who was also the editor of F. There was no statement of editorial intent for this version, but the policy was straightforward: a novel was presented in each issue. Although these were substantially cut, they still took {{up most of the}} magazine, with the result that the other stories tended to be very short. As in the first incarnation, the contents were of fairly good quality, with contributions from well-known writers. However, the magazine was no more successful than before, and lasted for only six quarterly issues; the last issue was August 1970.|$|E
