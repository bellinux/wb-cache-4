In this paper, the impact of <b>transportation</b> <b>costs</b> on trade is re-examined by incorporating alternative determinants of <b>transportation</b> <b>costs</b> and trade in a gravity model of bilateral trade in nine Asian (Asia Nine) countries. We find that technology and cultural factors tend to stimulate bilateral trade between member countries.

The model is consistent with evidence from estimations of the Gravity Equation.

The effect of trade barriers is amplified by the production externalities thereby producing important border effects, as documented in the empirical literature. We also study the equilibrium specialization and trade patterns for different levels of <b>transportation</b> <b>costs.</b> Low <b>transportation</b> <b>costs</b> imply the classic core-periphery specialization pattern.

The company stated it would purchase only one percent of its tomatoes from that area and other suppliers could easily make up the difference. Speaking on the dispute, Grover stated, [...] "We’re {{being asked to do}} something that we have legal questions about. We want {{to find a way to}} make sure that workers are protected and receive a decent wage." [...] CIW spokesperson Julia Perkins faulted this move, stating, [...] "...farm workers across the country and world face the same problems as those in the Immokalee region, but many do not have a human rights organization, such as the CIW, to stand up for their interests. Running away from the scene of the crime, does that make you any more innocent?

2500|$|The greatly {{expanded}} railroad network, using inexpensive steel rails produced by new steel making processes, dramatically lowered <b>transportation</b> <b>cost</b> to areas {{without access to}} navigable waterways. Low freight rates allowed large manufacturing facilities with great economies of scale. Machinery became a large industry and many types of machines were developed.

2500|$|The {{widespread}} use of refrigeration allowed for {{a vast amount of}} new agricultural opportunities to open up in the United States. [...] New markets emerged throughout the United States in areas that were previously uninhabited and far-removed from heavily populated areas. New agricultural opportunity presented itself in areas that were considered rural such as states in the south and in the west. [...] Shipments on a large scale from the south and California were both made around the same time although natural ice was used from the Sierras in California rather than manufactured ice in the south. [...] Refrigeration allowed for many areas to specialize in the growing of specific fruits. California specialized in several fruits, grapes, peaches, pears, plums, and apples while Georgia became famous for specifically its peaches. In California, the acceptance of the refrigerated rail carts lead to an increase of car loads from 4,500 carloads in 1895 to between 8,000 and 10,000 carloads in 1905. [...] The Gulf States, Arkansas, Missouri and Tennessee entered into strawberry production on a large-scale while Mississippi became the center of the tomato industry. New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and Nevada grew cantaloupes. [...] Without refrigeration this would have not been possible. By 1917, well-established fruit and vegetable areas that were close to eastern markets felt the pressure of competition from these distant specialized centers. [...] Refrigeration was not limited to meat, fruit and vegetables but it also encompassed dairy product and dairy farms. In the early twentieth century large cities got their dairy supply from farms as far as 400 miles. [...] Dairy products were not as easily transported great distances like fruits and vegetables due to greater perishability. [...] Refrigeration made production possible in the west far from eastern markets, so much in fact that dairy farmers could pay <b>transportation</b> <b>cost</b> and still undersell their eastern competitors. [...] Refrigeration and the refrigerated rail gave opportunity to areas with rich soil far from natural channel of transport such as a river, valley trail or harbors.|$|E

40|$|The {{containerized}} maritime {{transportation industry}} {{is characterized by}} oligopolistic competition and economies of scale. In this paper, we examine the effect that these industry characteristics have on trade. We build a model of endogenous <b>transportation</b> <b>costs</b> within a standard Melitz (2003) framework. Countries with large trade volumes face lower <b>transportation</b> <b>costs</b> because they {{can take advantage of}} economies of scale and competition in the transportation industry. We assemble a unique dataset on the containerized maritime transportation industry. The dataset includes the freight prices for transporting a container to a foreign port, the number of transportation firms operating between the US and foreign port, and the port-to-port trade flows. We document facts that are consistent with our theory. First, countries with larger trade volumes pay less in <b>transportation</b> <b>costs.</b> Second, countries with larger trade volumes have more and larger transportation firms. We then calibrate our model and estimate a transportation technology to evaluate trade reforms. Our results indicate that <b>transportation</b> <b>costs</b> fall more in smaller markets from tariff reductions.

These structural transformations weaken dispersion forces given by farmers tied to the land, whereas they strengthen agglomeration forces generated by footloose non-agricultural workers. Thus, a substantial decline in <b>transportation</b> <b>costs</b> gives rise to agglomeration of non-agricultural activities. ...|$|R
