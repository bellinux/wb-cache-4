5|$|During the night, {{the four}} boats became separated. Bulkeley spent time {{looking for the}} other three boats, {{but was unable to}} find them in the darkness. At dawn he gave up, and headed for one of the {{alternative}} hiding places. Kelly's PT-34 was the first to reach the rendezvous point, a cove on Tagauayan Island, two hours late at 09:30. There was no sign of the other boats, and Rockwell, in the same boat with Kelly, was far from convinced that Kelly had found the correct island. Some repairs were made, and the boat was refueled by hand pumps from the drums. Two men were posted atop the island's tallest hill <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the Japanese and the other boats.|$|E
5|$|Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic is a 2006 graphic memoir by the American {{cartoonist}} Alison Bechdel, {{author of}} the comic strip Dykes <b>to</b> <b>Watch</b> <b>Out</b> <b>For.</b> It chronicles the author's childhood and youth in rural Pennsylvania, United States, focusing on her complex relationship with her father. The book addresses themes of sexual orientation, gender roles, suicide, emotional abuse, dysfunctional family life, {{and the role of}} literature in understanding oneself and one's family. Writing and illustrating Fun Home took seven years, in part because of Bechdel's laborious artistic process, which includes photographing herself in poses for each human figure.|$|E
50|$|Morton and {{his family}} were plaintiffs in a NAC-supported lawsuit to return the rights of parents who wish to bring their {{children}} with them to Hippie Hollow, a clothing-optional public park near Austin, Texas. Morton has also testified before various state legislative committees on behalf of naturists, and has been chairman of NAC since 1997. Before joining the board, he was an NAC area representative. In addition <b>to</b> <b>watching</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> naturist's interests in all 50 states of the U.S., he currently watches for anti-nudity legislation in all 254 counties in Texas since that state voted for home rule, with the result that any county in Texas can enact its own anti-nudist ordinances and laws.|$|R

25|$|Reagan National Airport is {{in between}} two {{overlapping}} No Fly Zone so pilots have <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the Pentagon and CIA headquarters. And on takeoff, pilots must ascend quickly and sharply turn left so they don't {{fly over the}} White House. After the attacks of September 11, security forces strongly enforce these rules.

25|$|Day-to-day {{operations}} will {{be handled}} rather {{like those of}} Docklands Light Railway, with service employees riding in some trains <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> disruptive passengers and unusual occurrences and to supply information to passengers. Unlike the DLR however, not every train will {{be accompanied by a}} service employee, and again unlike the DLR, service employees have no task in the actual operation of the train. Hence the grade of automation is mixed between GoA 3 - Driverless, and GoA 4 - Unattended Train Operation (UTO). Doors close automatically, supervised by light barriers and pressure-sensitive door edges. Only in the case of service disruptions will a service employee take over the task of driving the train. For this purpose, all service employees are fully trained drivers.|$|E
25|$|In Order of the Phoenix, Sirius gives Harry {{a mirror}} he {{originally}} used {{to communicate with}} James {{while they were in}} separate detentions. That mirror is a part of a set of Two-way Mirrors that are activated by holding one of them and saying the name of the other possessor, causing his or her face to appear on the caller's mirror and vice versa. Harry receives this mirror from Sirius in a package after spending his Christmas holiday at Grimmauld Place. Harry, at first, chooses not to open the package, although he does discover the mirror after Sirius's death, by which point it is no longer functional. It makes its second appearance in Deathly Hallows when Mundungus Fletcher loots Grimmauld Place and sells Sirius's mirror to Aberforth Dumbledore, who uses it <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> Harry in Deathly Hallows. When Harry desperately cries for help to a shard of the magical mirror (which broke in the bottom of his trunk), a brilliant blue eye belonging to Aberforth (which Harry mistakes for Albus's eye), appears and he sends Dobby, who arrives to help Harry escape from Malfoy Manor to Shell Cottage.|$|E

5000|$|According to Loudwire, [...] "'Wastelands' {{starts with}} a hip-hop verse and the song {{has a lot of}} groove with heavy drum and bass. The chorus is catchy yet sludgy and has some grit <b>to</b> it. <b>Watch</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the heavy {{breakdown}} {{in the middle of the}} song. Linkin Park takes you on a sonic roller-coaster ride as they play around with the tempo and ambiance of the song".

25|$|New Zealand {{started their}} {{response}} quickly, but the reintroduction of Broad paid dividends for England {{when he got}} the wicket of Ronchi in the sixth over. It was Guptill who England had <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>out</b> <b>for,</b> however, following his performances earlier in the series, but it was another newcomer to the England side, Tredwell, who put paid to the New Zealand opener's plans of going the entire series without getting out, bowling him with his fifth ball of the match for 38. Williamson (19) was next to go, trapped plumb LBW by Root for his first ODI wicket. Bresnan then got Munro for a golden duck, before Tredwell had McCullum caught behind for 6, and Franklin edged Broad to gully for 7. Taylor and Nathan McCullum managed to put on a 53-run partnership for the seventh wicket before Broad caught McCullum off the bowling of Bresnan. Three overs later, Finn had Southee for 15 and the contest was all but over; Taylor was still in, two runs away from his half-century, but with 92 runs still to get in 12 overs and only two wickets in hand, the task was too much for New Zealand. Taylor gave it his best shot, though, making it to 71 before holing out to Bresnan off the bowling of Tredwell, and Mills added 28 runs of his own, but McClenaghan was unable to hold his own end up for long and New Zealand were bowled out for 253, 35 runs from victory.|$|E

Bava was initially going to end the film on a shot of Jacqueline Pierreux's dead character. On the last day of filming, Billitteri suggested to not end the film on such a bleak image and told Bava to change it. Bava changed the ending to Boris Karloff's character of Gorka on horseback who cautions the audience <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> vampires.

500|$|Eastwood {{worked at}} a number of jobs, {{including}} lifeguard, paper carrier, grocery clerk, forest firefighter, and golf caddy. Eastwood has said that he tried to enroll at Seattle University [...] but was then drafted into the United States Army during the Korean War. [...] "He always dropped the Korean War reference, hoping everyone would conclude that he was in combat and might be some sort of hero. Actually, he'd been a lifeguard at Fort Ord in northern California for his entire stint in the military," [...] commented Eastwood's former longtime companion, Sondra Locke.

[...] An Associated Press writer warned opponents <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> Petoskey: [...] "It is about time for grid foeman to wake up when Ted Petoskey, end and fullback on the University of Michigan football team, gets to dreaming.

500|$|Saadiq's songwriting is {{characterized}} by straightforward romanticism, positive exhortations, pining ballads, and message songs. Christgau interpreted Saadiq's persona on the album to be [...] "a romantic who stays true to the deliberate simplicity" [...] of the song titles, but [...] "never threatens to assume the fetal position if he doesn't get the extreme cuddling he craves." [...] Patrick Varine of the Observer-Dispatch asserted that Saadiq deviates significantly from contemporary R lyrics: [...] "there are no thinly-veiled food-sex metaphors or pimp fantasies". His songwriting also paraphrases classic soul lyrics and, on the album's slower songs, expresses tightly coiled emotions. Saadiq said that some songs were written about his life experiences. He described the album as [...] "basically a series of love songs about music, how falling in love can be easy, but staying true to it can be tricky." [...] He elaborated on this interpretation in an interview for the Chicago Tribune: [...] "You have <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> those curves. [...] music comes out, {{and how do you}} stay true to what you love? I’m not saying everything has to sound like a '60s record to stay true, but you should never take the relationship lightly." ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{was another}} puzzled man, too--the Rev. Mr. Burgess. For days, {{wherever}} he went, {{people seemed to}} follow him or <b>to</b> be <b>watching</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> him; and if he ever {{found himself in a}} retired spot, a member of the nineteen would be sure to appear, thrust an envelope privately into his hand, whisper [...] "To be opened at the town-hall Friday evening," [...] then vanish away like a guilty thing. He was expecting that there might be one claimant for the sack--doubtful, however, Goodson being dead--but it never occurred to him that all this crowd might be claimants. When the great Friday came at last, he found that he had nineteen envelopes.|$|R
50|$|In the end, many British {{officials}} {{suspected that}} the search and destroy didn't work out well because {{the way it was}} conducted was in a brutalized way. British troops often set fire to villages accused of supporting the insurgents, detaining thousands of suspected collaborators, and in order to deny the insurgents cover. British units that discovered civilians providing assistance to insurgents were to detain and interrogate them to discover the location of insurgent camps. Insurgents had numerous advantages over British forces; they lived in closer proximity to villagers, they sometimes had relatives or close friends in the village, and they were not afraid to threaten violence or torture and murder village leaders as an example to the others, forcing them to assist them with food and information. British forces thus faced a dual threat: the insurgents and the silent network in villages who, willingly or unwillingly, supported them. While the insurgents rarely sought out contact with British forces, they did use terrorist tactics to intimidate civilians and elicit material support. British troops often described the terror of jungle patrols; in addition <b>to</b> <b>watching</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> insurgent fighters, they had to navigate difficult terrain and avoid dangerous animals and insects. Many patrols would stay in the jungle for days, even weeks, without encountering the enemy and then, in a brief moment, insurgents would ambush them. British forces, unable to distinguish from friend to foe, had to adjust to the constant risk of an insurgent attack. These instances led to the infamous incident at Batang Kali where 24 unarmed villagers were killed by British troops.|$|R
