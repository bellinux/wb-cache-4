5|$|Construction of {{the canal}} began in 1822, with James Hollinsworth as the {{engineer}} and John Easton as the senior surveyor. The Bristol and Taunton scheme had incorporated a high-level crossing of the River Parrett, but the shortened canal would now join the Parrett at Huntworth, where a basin was to be constructed. This change of route resulted in the Reverend Robert Gray obtaining an injunction, {{and work on the}} lower half {{of the canal}} stopped until the new route could be properly authorised by the 1824 Act. By this time, the estimated cost had risen to £60,000. Below Durston, the canal was cut into <b>the</b> <b>clay</b> subsoil, <b>the</b> <b>clay</b> forming a naturally waterproof channel; but from Durston to Taunton the canal bed had to be puddled with clay to make it watertight, as the underlying ground was shale.|$|E

40|$|The {{soil water}} {{retention}} (SWR) characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>clays</b> {{play an important}} role in controlling their engineering behaviour, particularly, in the unsaturated state. Although, researchers have attempted to understand the water retention characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>clays</b> in their reconstituted or remoulded state, such studies are rare for <b>the</b> <b>clays</b> in their intact state. In this context, it becomes important to understand the influence of initial state of compaction, which would create different pore- and fabric- structure (viz., microstructure), on the water retention characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>clays.</b> With this in view, SWR behaviour was determined experimentally for <b>the</b> swelling <b>clays</b> (dried from different compaction states, viz., intact, reconstituted and remoulded) by employing Dewpoint Potentiameter (WP 4 C®). The changes in the pore-size distribution of <b>the</b> <b>clays</b> at different stages of drying cycle were also studied by employing the Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry. The study reveals that the SWR curves for the intact and reconstituted specimens of <b>the</b> <b>clays</b> converge beyond a certain stage of drying. Also, a critical analysis of changes in the pore structure of <b>the</b> swelling <b>clay</b> specimens, during drying, indicates that the progressively deforming pore structure {{play an important role}} in controlling its water retention characteristics to a great extent...|$|R

At its maximum occupation the village may have had 15 houses in use with a population of up to 200 people. Two distinct phases of occupation have been identified. Early houses were timber framed square or rectangular and built of oak but later buildings were circular huts.

5|$|This {{theory is}} debatable; Hermann Alexander Schlögl, Wolfgang Helck, Peter Kaplony and Jochem Kahl argue that <b>the</b> <b>clay</b> seals were only {{found at the}} {{entrance}} area of Peribsen's tomb {{and none of them}} depict Peribsen and Sekhemib's names together in one inscription. Furthermore, they remark that it was customary for a pharaoh to bury and seal his predecessor's tomb; the presence of Sekhemib's seals show the line of dynastic inheritance. Similar inferences can be drawn from the ivory tablets of king Hotepsekhemwy found at the entrance of king Qa'a's tomb and <b>the</b> <b>clay</b> seals of Djoser found at the entrance of Khasekhemwy's tomb. Schlögl, Helck, Kaplony and Kahl are convinced that the discovery of Sekhemib's seals support the view that Sekhemib immediately succeeded Peribsen and buried him.|$|E
