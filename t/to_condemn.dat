5|$|The whole {{trial was}} seen {{by some as a}} {{political}} trial, inspired by the Belgian establishment. The federal parliament had notably amended the Constitution in order to create legal possibilities <b>to</b> <b>condemn</b> the party. The Vlaams Blok also pointed at the problem of political nomination of judges, and again claimed that the lawsuit had been a political process coordinated with the Belgian Ministry of the Interior.|$|E
5|$|According to {{contemporary}} rumors, Verne and d'Ennery came to difficulties over {{the treatment of}} science in the play, with d'Ennery wanting <b>to</b> <b>condemn</b> scientific research and Verne advocating a more science-friendly and hopeful approach. Verne reportedly cut some especially negative lines out of the script, and protested when d'Ennery had them reinserted for the production. Journey Through the Impossible would be their last collaboration. The play is also Verne's only contribution to the féerie genre.|$|E
5|$|Amid German defeats {{against the}} Russians on the Eastern Front after 1942, the King {{prepared}} {{for the end of}} the war. He ordered the preparation of a document, known as the Political Testament (Testament Politique), which would justify his behaviour under the occupation and detail his interventions on behalf of Belgian prisoners of war and deported workers. Leopold however continued <b>to</b> <b>condemn</b> the action of the Belgian government in exile (based in London after October 1940). On 7 June 1944, following D-Day, he was deported to Germany. He was finally liberated by American forces on 7 May 1945.|$|E

5|$|Christopher's brother, Stephen Báthory, {{who succeeded}} John Sigismund in 1571, made Christopher captain of Várad (now Oradea in Romania). After being elected King of Poland, Stephen Báthory adopted {{the title of}} Prince of Transylvania and made Christopher voivode in 1576. Christopher cooperated with Márton Berzeviczy, whom his brother {{appointed}} to supervise {{the administration of the}} Principality of Transylvania {{as the head of the}} Transylvanian chancellery at Kraków. Christopher ordered the imprisonment of Ferenc Dávid, a leading theologian of the Unitarian Church of Transylvania, who started <b>to</b> <b>condemn</b> the adoration of Jesus.

The day after Groves took over, he and Marshall took a train to Tennessee to inspect the site that Marshall had chosen for the proposed production plant at Oak Ridge. Groves was suitably impressed with the site, and steps were taken <b>to</b> <b>condemn</b> the land. Protests, legal appeals, and congressional inquiries were to no avail. By mid-November US Marshals were tacking notices to vacate on farmhouse doors, and construction contractors were moving in.|$|E
5|$|In October 1964, at a {{ceremony}} in honour of Soviet cosmonauts, Brezhnev called for the strengthening of the Party apparatus. This speech {{was only the beginning}} of a large campaign directed against Kosygin. Several newspapers, such as Pravda and Kommunist, criticised the work of the Council of Ministers, and indirectly Kosygin, its chairman, for planning the economy in an unrealistic fashion, and used the highly aggressive rhetoric previously used <b>to</b> <b>condemn</b> Khrushchev against Kosygin.|$|E

5|$|In the Official History of Australian Peacekeeping, Humanitarian and Post-Cold War Operations, author David Horner {{stated that}} the Australian {{government}} led by Robert Menzies was loath to criticise South Africa during the 1950s. At that time Australia generally opposed anti-colonial movements (which were often supported by the Soviets or China), believing them part of a worldwide communist offensive. Indeed, as late as 1961 Australia (and Britain) abstained from a vote <b>to</b> <b>condemn</b> South Africa in the UN.|$|E
5|$|Issues of Gallicanism were {{prominent}} in the 1689 conclave that had elected Alexander VIII. Alexander's predecessor, Innocent XI, had refused to confirm new French bishops {{to the point where}} thirty-five dioceses lacked a bishop confirmed by Rome in 1688. Alexander's election had been secured by promising that he would confirm the unconfirmed French bishops. Despite this, Alexander's last act as pope before he died was <b>to</b> <b>condemn</b> the Declaration of the Clergy of France on 1 February 1691.|$|E

5|$|The {{chain of}} {{events leading up to}} Bishop Tempier's {{condemnation}} of 1277 is still not entirely clear. The Catholic Encyclopedia records that the theologians of the University of Paris had been very uneasy due to the antagonism that existed between Christian dogmas and certain Peripatetic doctrines. According to the historian Edward Grant, the theologians desired <b>to</b> <b>condemn</b> Aristotle's teachings on the eternity {{of the world and the}} unicity of the intellect.|$|E
5|$|The {{claim that}} all humans are due {{dignity and respect}} as {{autonomous}} agents means that medical professionals should be happy for their treatments to be performed on anyone and that patients must never be treated merely as useful for society. Kant's approach to sexual ethics emerged from his view that humans should never be used merely {{as a means to}} an end, leading him to regard sexual activity as degrading and <b>to</b> <b>condemn</b> certain specific sexual practices - for example, extramarital sex. Feminist philosophers have used Kantian ethics <b>to</b> <b>condemn</b> practices such as prostitution and pornography because they treat women as ends. Kant also believed that, because animals do not possess rationality, we cannot have duties to them except indirect duties not to develop immoral dispositions through cruelty towards them. Kant used the example of lying as an application of his ethics: because there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, we must never lie, even if it seems that lying would bring about better consequences than telling the truth.|$|E
5|$|The1986 Commonwealth Gameswere held in Edinburgh, Scotland {{and were}} the second Games {{to be held in}} Edinburgh.

On 14 May, the Archbishop of Zagreb, Aloysius Stepinac, sent a letter of protest to Pavelić after receiving news of the killings. He failed <b>to</b> <b>condemn</b> the atrocity publicly. The next day, Pavelić visited Rome and was granted a private audience with Pope Pius XII, who offered de facto recognition of the NDH on behalf of the Holy See. Although he was aware that Pavelić was a totalitarian dictator, {{there is no evidence that}} he had knowledge of the first Glina massacre at the time.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert had {{previously}} been investigated by Eugene at Paris in April 1147, but this hearing came to nothing for two reasons. One was that Gilbert's opponents were not unified in what they opposed in Gilbert's teachings. The second reason was {{that no one had}} a copy of the treatise on Boethius by Gilbert that was in dispute. Prior to the second hearing at Reims, Bernard of Clairvaux, who was opposed to Gilbert's teachings, held a private meeting with a number of the attendees, where Bernard attempted to pressure them <b>to</b> <b>condemn</b> Gilbert. This offended the various cardinals in attendance, who then proceeded to insist that they were the only persons who could judge the case.|$|E

These are basic human rights that people are being denied of; they’re no minority.
