5|$|At this point, Khánh had {{not spoken}} up and allowed <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> moves had been made without his {{consultation}} or against his will, and an attempt {{on the part of}} other officers to take power themselves. Hương had actually privately endorsed the dissolution of the HNC, as both he and the Young Turks thought it would allow them to gain more power and influence over Khánh.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{a second}} Order in Council, the British Indian Ocean Territory (Constitution) Order 2004, was produced, again {{reinstating}} the off-limits {{nature of the}} Chagos Islands. Bancoult brought a second case, arguing that this Order was again ultra vires and unreasonable, and that the British government had violated legitimate expectation by passing the second Order after giving <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Chagossians were free to return home.|$|E
5|$|Many {{fish have}} eyespots near their tails, {{a form of}} automimicry, to {{distract}} attacks away from the vulnerable head and eye. For example, Chaetodon capistratus has both a (disruptive) eyestripe to conceal the eye, and a large eyespot near its tail, giving <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> head is {{at the tail end}} of the body.|$|E
40|$|The article {{describes}} the importance of public performance for {{the image of the}} Futurists, mainly of Bruno Jasieński. <b>The</b> <b>impressions</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> artists gained from Helena Buczyńska’s ‘word-arts’ performance, and Scriabin’s idea of ‘Art Religion’ they were exposed to, inspired the young poets. The article finishes with enumeration of several inspirations that are being found in Jasieński’s texts by modern musicians adapting his poetry.

5|$|The diversionary attacks went well, with Soviet forces acting under <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Poles had targets {{other than}} Vilnius. Despite their diversionary intent, these attacks succeeded {{in their own}} right, with Generał Józef Adam Lasocki taking Lida in two days despite {{unexpectedly}} strong resistance, and Generał Stefan Mokrzecki taking Nowogrodek in three days and Baranowicze in four.|$|E
5|$|Ambassador Bishop clearly {{explained}} his rationale {{to the security}} detail, which was to avoid any impression that they were intervening in the violence in Mogadishu. He feared that the embassy would be targeted by organized attacks if any group involved in the clashes got <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> US was intervening in the conflict. To this effect, he requested the Voice of America and BBC broadcast announcements that the forces were present only to evacuate the embassy and would not interfere in the conflict. The Marines who had been doused in fuel during the refueling {{were able to take}} a shower and wash their clothes.|$|E
5|$|Freda {{felt that}} I Vampiri {{did not succeed}} financially in Italy due to the country's {{audience}} reluctance to an Italian interpretation of the horror genre. For Freda's next film, Caltiki – The Immortal Monster, he used an English pseudonym of Robert Hampton to give <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film was not Italian. Freda attempted a gothic horror film again five years later with his film The Horrible Dr. Hichcock. Other crew members {{would go on to}} direct horror films following I Vampiri, such as screenwriter Piero Regnoli who directed The Playgirls and the Vampire (1960) and Bava who became the cinematographer on Freda's Caltiki as well as directing Black Sunday (1960).|$|E

5|$|General Mack {{thought that}} Austrian {{security}} relied on sealing off the gaps through the mountainous Black Forest area in Southern Germany that had witnessed much fighting during the campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars. Mack {{believed that there}} would be no action in Central Germany. Mack decided to make the city of Ulm the centerpiece of his defensive strategy, which called for a containment of the French until the Russians under Kutuzov could arrive and alter the odds against Napoleon. Ulm was protected by the heavily fortified Michelsberg heights, giving Mack <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> city was virtually impregnable from outside attack.|$|E
5|$|It was John's {{hope that}} the Pope would give him {{valuable}} legal and moral support, and accordingly John played for time; the King had declared {{himself to be a}} papal vassal in 1213 and correctly believed he could count on the Pope for help. John also began recruiting mercenary forces from France, although some were later sent back to avoid giving <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> King was escalating the conflict. In a further move to shore up his support, John took an oath to become a crusader, a move which gave him additional political protection under church law, even though many felt the promise was insincere.|$|E
5|$|President Truman ordered {{military}} operations (including the B-29 bombings) to continue until official word of Japanese surrender was received. However, news correspondents incorrectly interpreted a comment by USAF commander Spaatz that the B-29s were not flying on August 11 (because of bad weather) as {{a statement that}} a ceasefire was in effect. To avoid giving the Japanese <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Allies had abandoned peace efforts and resumed bombing, Truman then ordered a halt to further bombings.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} October the Special Commission on Afghanistan, which {{consisted}} of Andropov, Gromyko, Ustinov and Ponomarev, wanted to end <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Soviet government supported Amin's leadership and policy. The KGB's First Chief Directorate was put under orders that {{something had to be}} done about Afghanistan, and several of its personnel were assembled to deal with the task. Andropov fought hard for Soviet intervention, saying to Brezhnev that Amin's policies had destroyed the military and the government's capabilities to handle the crisis by use of mass repression. The plan, according to Andropov, was to assemble a small force to intervene and remove Amin from power and replace him with Karmal. The Soviet Union declared its plan to intervene in Afghanistan on 12 December 1979, and the Soviet leadership initiated Operation Storm-333 (the first phase of the intervention) on 27 December 1979.|$|E
5|$|On , the Mongol leader Hulagu sent through John the Hungarian a new {{letter to}} King Louis IX of France, again {{offering}} an alliance. The letter explained that previously, the Mongols {{had been under}} <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pope {{was the leader of}} the Christians, but now they realized that the true power rested with the French monarchy. The letter mentioned Hulagu's intention to capture Jerusalem {{for the benefit of the}} pope, and asked for Louis to send a fleet against Egypt. Hulagu promised the restoration of Jerusalem to the Christians, but also still insisted on Mongol sovereignty, in the Mongols' quest for conquering the world. It is unclear whether or not King Louis actually received the letter, but at some point it was transmitted to Pope Urban, who answered in a similar way as his predecessors. In his papal bull Exultavit cor nostrum, Urban congratulated Hulagu on his expression of goodwill towards the Christian faith, and encouraged him to convert to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|On 1 December 1943, the {{division}} {{was once again}} renamed. Now known as the 77th (Holding) Division, it was responsible for retraining soldiers {{who had been on}} medical leave. Once recruits were fully trained, and men returning from injury retrained, they were allocated to formations fighting overseas. Notably, the formation was used as a source of reinforcements for the 21st Army Group, which was fighting in Normandy. After all available British army troops left the United Kingdom for France, {{the division}} was disbanded and re-formed as a deception unit to give Germany <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British army had more divisions than it did. The notional 77th Division was held in reserve within the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The royal touch (also {{known as}} the king's touch) {{was a form of}} laying on of hands, whereby French and English monarchs touched their subjects, {{regardless}} of social classes, with the intent to cure them of various diseases and conditions. The thaumaturgic touch was most commonly applied to people suffering from tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis (better known as scrofula or the King's Evil), and exclusively to them from the 16th century onwards. The disease rarely resulted in death and often went into remission on its own, giving <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> monarch's touch cured it. The claimed power was most notably exercised by monarchs who sought to demonstrate the legitimacy of their reign and of their newly founded dynasties.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{few months}} of John's return, rebel barons in the north and east of England were organising {{resistance}} to his rule. John held a council in London in January 1215 to discuss potential reforms and sponsored discussions in Oxford between his agents and the rebels during the spring. John appears to have been playing for time until Pope Innocent III could send letters giving him explicit papal support. This was particularly important for John, as a way of pressuring the barons but also as a way of controlling Stephen Langton, the Archbishop of Canterbury. In the meantime, John began to recruit fresh mercenary forces from Poitou, although some were later sent back to avoid giving <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> king was escalating the conflict. John announced his intent to become a crusader, a move which gave him additional political protection under church law.|$|E
5|$|Within {{less than}} a week of the mutiny, a Court of Inquiry was set up to {{investigate}} and collect evidence for the trial for the mutineers. Although the Court of Inquiry was meant to take place behind closed doors, as accordance with standard military procedures, the proceeding was held in public instead. According to Harper and Miller this was to give the public <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mutineers “were being tried for mutiny and shooting with intent to kill and not, as alleged for refusal to go to Turkey’’. Although the Court of Inquiry was clearly trying to downplay the link between Turkey and the mutiny, with the declassification of new documents and evidence, another perception has emerged in explaining the cause of the mutiny and that is the role of pan-Islamism. Contrary to official British colonial authorities, the mutiny was not an isolated case of a purely local affair but was instead part of a wider anti-British and pro-Muslim battle.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{remarks and}} <b>the</b> <b>impressions</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> author drew {{from some of}} Kumaran Asan's most {{important}} poems (namely Oru vinapuvu, Nalini, Candalabhiksuki, Cintavistayaya Sita e Karuna, composed between 1907 and 1923) when she translated them from Malayalam into Italian, {{are the subject of}} this paper. Asan's preferred poetical trends and recurring themes are analized together with the different main characters he outlines in his plots. The structure of the poems is considered, and their features and peculiarities of composition are pointed out. Special attention is given on Asan's innovations in the choice of subject-matters, and {{in the way in which}} his characters are presented and psychologically investigated...|$|R

5|$|Word of Lamellerie's {{preparations}} reached Collingwood, and {{he planned}} a ruse {{to lure the}} French frigate squadron out into open water. Withdrawing all the large vessels of the blockade squadron, Collingwood kept only the 36-gun frigate HMS Hydra and the 18-gun sloop HMS Moselle in position to create <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> principal blockading force had been driven off. This it was hoped would draw Lamellerie into {{an attack on the}} lone ships that would allow the rest of Collingwood's squadron, hidden just beyond the horizon, to counterattack and annihilate the French squadron. However, on 23 February a strong westerly wind blew up and the main squadron, Hydra and Moselle were all blown too far to the east. This was spotted by lookouts on shore and Lamellerie took the opportunity to leave port on 26 February, while the British ships were still out of position.|$|E
5|$|Dalmazzo urged Roatta {{to expand}} Italian links with Serb {{nationalist}} groups into {{an alliance with}} them. At this time, the Italians were looking for allies to restore order, fight the Partisans, and support their political claims to NDH territory, and were under <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> various Serb nationalist groups were far better organised than they actually were. For example, Roatta {{was under the impression}} that Jevđević represented the Herzegovinian Chetniks, and that they were aligned with Dangić. In early March, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin suddenly told the Italians that they were effectively in control of a Chetnik movement, and were ready to collaborate with the Italians on the latter's terms. Jevđević sent a message to Dalmazzo explaining that the Herzegovinian Chetniks wanted to avenge Todorović and were concentrating around Nevesinje ready to demonstrate their loyalty to the Italians. Despite their statements, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin faced significant difficulties; the Serb nationalist groups had yet to demonstrate their military value to the Italians, and not all of the armed groups even acknowledged their leadership.|$|E
5|$|Filming the pre-title {{sequence}} {{went through}} some alterations. One {{of the scenes}} saw Johnny being foot whipped, however the shot where the stick struck the soles of the feet was cut out due to its brutality. Also, when discussing how Johnny would be expelled from the mosque afterwards, Nalluri suggested using the idea where he is thrown {{to the top of}} the surveillance van, which would give the audience <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> antagonists were on to them. Later on in the episode, Nalluri wanted to include some exposition shots, which shows Khaldun's actions while he narrates them to MI5. In one scene, Tom observes Khaldun inside a prison cell by opening a slide view at the prison door. However one had to be made because no such doors exist in the United Kingdom. Following the broadcast of the episode, the producers were surprised to hear that the BBC were unhappy with a scene showing Harry holding a Costa Coffee cup, as the corporation believed it was done out of product placement. They were also surprised to learn that they did not take notice in a scene with Malcolm Wynn-Jones delightfully eating a piece of chocolate from a Black Magic chocolate box, which they thought was a more obvious example. Portraying actor Hugh Simon had to spit out the chocolate after the take as he disliked the confectionery.|$|E
