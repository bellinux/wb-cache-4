5|$|Under Glenn Hoddle, Gascoigne {{was picked}} {{regularly}} and helped England {{to win the}} Tournoi de France in 1997 ahead of Brazil, France and Italy. Qualification for the 1998 FIFA World Cup {{went down to the}} last group game against Italy at the Stadio Olimpico, and Gascoigne put in a disciplined and mature performance to help England secure the 0–0 draw <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> to take them through to the tournament. However, British tabloid newspapers showed pictures of Gascoigne eating kebabs late at night with DJ friend Chris Evans only a week before the final squad was due to be chosen. Hoddle elected not to pick Gascoigne in the final squad and after hearing the news Gascoigne wrecked Hoddle's room in a rage before being restrained. Gascoigne was never to play for his country again, having won 57 caps and scored 10 goals.|$|E

5|$|The 2013–14 UEFA Europa League {{campaign}} {{started in}} record-breaking fashion. In July 2013, the club won 2–0 {{away from home}} against ÍF Fuglafjørður of the Faroe Islands in the first qualifying round. This was the Blues' first win in Europe since 2005, and their first away win in Europe since 1966, when they defeated Vålerengen 4–1 during their run to the quarter-finals of the 1966–67 European Cup. In the second leg at Windsor Park, the Blues won 3–0 to go through to the next round 5–0 on aggregate. This was the club's largest aggregate victory in a European tie since defeating Aris Bonnevoie 9–4 on aggregate {{in the first round}} of the 1966–67 European Cup. It was also the first time that a Northern Irish club had won both legs of a European tie in any competition. They followed this up in the next round by winning away from home again. Despite being massive underdogs for the tie, a 1–0 victory away to Xanthi of Greece made it three consecutive victories in Europe, without conceding a goal in the process – another first for the club. However, in the second leg at home they went down 2–1 after extra time, which eliminated them on the away goals rule. The following season, Linfield's first venture into Europe under new manager Warren Feeney was in the Faroe Islands against B36 Tórshavn in the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League first qualifying round, which was also Feeney's first competitive game in charge of the club. Linfield came out 2–1 victors with goals coming from Jamie Mulgrew and Michael Carvill. The return leg was played at Glenavon's ground, Mourneview Park, due to the redevelopment of Windsor Park. Linfield had to settle for a 1–1 draw, but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> to secure passage into the second qualifying round for the second successive season, where they were drawn to face AIK from Sweden. An 87th-minute Andrew Waterworth goal in the home leg at Mourneview Park ensured a 1–0 win for Linfield in their 100th competitive European match since 1959.|$|E

While coming out to bat in his last innings later that day at his adopted home, the WACA Ground in Perth, Johnson received a guard of honour from the New Zealand players, who congratulated him for his prolific career. He scored 35 runs in his final innings and then took both wickets in New Zealand's second innings, with the match ending in a draw <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> for Australia to retain the Trans Tasman Trophy.|$|E
25|$|September {{began with}} an {{impressive}} pitching duel between Clayton Kershaw and Roy Oswalt. Kershaw struck out 11 batters but allowed two solo home runs and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> to do him in. Oswalt took a no-hitter into the sixth inning as the Phillies closed out the series with a 5–1 victory. The rival San Francisco Giants came to Dodger Stadium for the next series. Chad Billingsley welcomed them to town by throwing a two-hitter for eight innings and hitting a two-run single for the decisive runs in the Dodgers 4–2 victory. In the second game, Ted Lilly pitched a one-hitter through six innings and Jay Gibbons hit a three-run homer to stake the Dodgers to a 4–0 lead. However, the bullpen imploded again and Jonathan Broxton blew his sixth save of the season when Juan Uribe hit a two-run homer off him for a 5–4 Giants win.|$|E

25|$|After the 1999–2000 season, Neptūnas {{became a}} {{constant}} LKL playoffs participant, though {{at first they}} were unable to overcome the quarter-finals barrier. During the 2000–2001 LKL season, Neptūnas, led by one of the LKL's best scorer and playmaker Vidas Ginevičius (19.59 points, 4.32 assists per game), finished in a desired 3rd seed during the regular season, but was shockingly eliminated 0–2 by the Alita Alytus in the quarter-final. During the following 2001–2002 LKL season, Neptūnas triumphed just 10 times per 32 games, but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> to qualify for the LKL playoffs as the 8th seed, although they were quickly wiped out 0–2 by an uprising Lithuanian powerhouse Lietuvos rytas Vilnius, led by young and hungry Ramūnas Šiškauskas, Robertas Javtokas, Simas Jasaitis, Rimantas Kaukėnas and a former Neptūnas player Arvydas Macijauskas. The 2002–2003 LKL season was only slightly different; this time the Neptūnas squad finished 6th in the regular season, but yet again was smashed 0–2 in the quarter-final by BC Šiauliai, in spite of all of Tomas Delininkaitis's efforts. Next season Neptūnas reached the all-time bottom by winning just 6 times per 36 games and finishing last in the league (10th).|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{advanced}} to the NLCS {{for the first time}} since 2009, where they faced off with the St. Louis Cardinals. In the first game of the series at Busch Stadium, Zack Greinke allowed only two runs in eight innings, while striking out a season high 10 batters, the first pitcher to strike out 10 Cardinals in a post-season game since Denny Galehouse in the 1944 World Series. Andre Ethier, making his first post-season start of the season after being limited to pinch hitting the previous round, just missed catching Carlos Beltrán's double at the fence to allow the two runs to score in the third. The Dodgers also managed two runs, on a single by Juan Uribe in the top of the third. The game remained tied into extra innings until Beltran recorded the walk-off hit off Kenley Jansen in the bottom of the 13th inning to give the Cardinals a 3-2 victory. This was the longest game in Dodgers post-season history since the 1916 World Series. In the second game, Clayton Kershaw and two relievers combined to allow only 2 hits and 1 run but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> as the Dodgers offense failed to score at all and they lost 1-0. Kershaw was the first starting pitcher in post-season history to lose a game while allowing no earned runs and two or fewer hits.|$|E

500|$|Given that Gibraltar was a {{small town}} {{with only a few}} defences {{protecting}} it, the solution was to build a massive series of tunnels and chambers inside the natural protection of the Rock of Gibraltar.

[...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened.

500|$|Glatton {{remained}} in Dover Harbour, an obstruction to shipping, with her hull visible {{at low tide}} as the Harbour Board could not afford the £45,000 quoted on average by salvage companies. Finally they asked the Harbourmaster, Captain John Iron, if {{he could do it}} for less. He estimated it would cost about £5,000 if he was granted use of the salvage craft already at Dover. The Board accepted his offer and work began in May 1925. Some [...] of silt were removed from underneath Glatton and her mainmast and superstructure were blasted away from the wreck. Four lifting lighters, with a capacity of , were hired, but they would not suffice to lift a water-logged [...] ship. It was necessary to seal all of the holes on her topside and pump air into each compartment at a rate of [...] per minute to restore her buoyancy. The first attempt to lift her began on 2 December 1925 and was successful in breaking the suction holding her to the bottom in combination with the rising tide. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> for the first try and the major lifting effort began the following day. Slowly she was moved, taking advantage of the tides, until on 16 March 1926 she was moved to a deep gully next to the western pier of the submarine harbour, close by the shore. The total cost was considerably more than originally estimated, but still far less than that quoted by the salvage companies, at no more than £12,000. There she remains, buried by landfill underneath the current car ferry terminal.|$|E
500|$|Alex Rees from Cosmopolitan {{felt that}} the video {{contained}} [...] "uncomfortable footage", but added that the [...] "emotionally unsettling" [...] images were able {{to reflect on the}} actual reality of what happens on college campuses. Claire Hodgson from the same publication described the clip as a [...] "beautifully shot, brilliantly acted short film", which [...] "really does not hold back when it comes to portraying the real horror of sexual assault in the most graphic way possible". Emily Shire from The Daily Beast was positive about the clip, calling it: [...] "both chilling and beautiful. The overall effect is as much, if not more, a credit to acclaimed director Catherine Hardwicke. The brutality of these snapshot scenes are remarkably moving in the scariest and most sickening way possible". However, Shire was disappointed with one aspect of the PSA – that the victims are supported by their friends and close-ones and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> to cope through the trauma. Instead Shire wanted to see the legal ramifications of such traumatic incidents, with the victims going to the police. Shire concluded the review saying: [...] "Gaga and Hardwicke deserve props for creating such a powerful, visceral, and aesthetically striking PSA. They've brought a tremendous amount of attention to rape and sexual assault. Yet, attention alone is inadequate balm for the victims of rape." [...] Conversely, Dan Solomon of Fast Company believed the video to be an [...] "important statement" [...] from Gaga and believed that it would direct further attention to The Hunting Ground.|$|E
