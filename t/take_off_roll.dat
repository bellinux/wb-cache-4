50|$|The {{original}} German Luftwaffe Fieseler F-156 Storch was {{an outstanding}} WWII airplane, designed to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> and land in extremely short distances.

The Pazmany PL-9 Stork is a 3/4 replica, with the same flying and handling characteristics as the original German Aircraft. The PL-9 Stork is a professionally designed STOL aircraft. It has a well-proven aircraft configuration designed {{for a number of}} functions such as fish spotting, forest fire detection, farm work, missionary work, etc. It features a welded chrome alloy steel tube fuselage and aluminum sheet metal/fabric covered wings and empennage.

50|$|An {{aircraft}} {{of a lower}} {{wake vortex}} category must {{not be allowed to}} take off less than two minutes behind an aircraft of a higher wake vortex category. If the following aircraft does not start its <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>roll</b> from the same point as the preceding aircraft, this is increased to three minutes. To put this more generally, an aircraft is usually safer if it is airborne before the rotation point of the airplane that took off before it. However, care must be taken to stay upwind (or otherwise away) from any vortices that were generated by the previous aircraft.|$|E

Statistics exist since 1884 for the Protestant churches and since 1917 for the Catholic Church.|$|R

The wreckage landed on the airport perimeter road in the limits of Kirkop, with some debris falling into a nearby Armed Forces of Malta barracks. All five people on board, three passengers and two crew members, died in the crash. All were French nationals, and the passengers were employees of the defence ministry, while the crew worked for CAE Aviation.|$|R
50|$|The airport's only sealed taxiway {{connects the}} apron and the asphalt runway, so {{aircraft}} taxi on the runway, and commence <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>roll</b> from runway ends. New Plymouth Airport is infamous for crosswinds, due {{mostly to the}} fact that although the tarmac runway faces into the prevailing SSW wind the area regularly receives a strong SSE/SE. The cross runway is not sealed, and thus airline traffic is limited to the tarmac runway, parallel to the sea. The tarmac runway is equipped with low intensity runway lighting, runway end lighting, and Precision Approach Path Indicators. The sealed taxiway and apron are also lit. The airport has VOR/DME equipment. It was equipped with an NDB, but this was recently removed.|$|E
5000|$|March 1, 1978 - Continental Airlines Flight 603, a DC-10-10, {{began its}} {{take-off}} from Los Angeles International Airport. Approaching V1 in the <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>roll,</b> the recapping tread of the No. 2 tire {{on the left}} main landing gear separated from the tire and the resulting overload caused that tire to blow out. That in turn, imposed an overload on the No. 1 tire on the same axle, resulting in a second blowout almost immediately after the first blowout. Shrapnel from the rims of the failed tires then damaged the No. 5 tire on the left main gear, causing it to also blow out. The blow outs ruptured a fuel tank, which combined with the excessive heat from the aborted take off maneuver, resulted in a massive fire. 2 passengers {{were killed in the}} ensuing evacuation and 2 died later from injuries sustained in the incident.|$|E
50|$|At 10.02 WIB, Flight 91 {{received}} clearance for take-off {{with additional}} clearance from ATC to turn left heading 120 and maintain 1500 ft. The crew read back the clearance heading 120 and maintaining 1000 ft. The ATC corrected the clearance to “one thousand five hundred feet.” The crew re-read it back as 1500 ft. The plane later took off. Some {{of the passengers}} and other witnesses stated that the aircraft had lifted its nose in an up attitude and <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>roll</b> was longer than that normally made by similar airplanes. Most of them stated that the aircraft nose began to lift-off a few meters {{from the end of}} the runway. The ATC tower controller recalled that after rotation the plane began to “roll” or veer to the left and to the right. Eyewitnesses on the ground also reported the same. Witnesses stated that the plane shook violently (possibly indicating a stall). The airplane then overran the departure end of Runway 23, impacted several approach lights, traveled through a grass area and over a river. Some witnesses on the ground recalled that the airplane left wing struck a building before it struck in the busy road, then heard two big explosions and saw the flames. As the airplane came to rest, it fractured into three parts.The airplane was considered a total loss due to the impact forces and post-crash fire. The aircraft had been separated due to impact along the flight track beginning {{from the end of the}} runway 23, and then the aircraft came to a halt 540 m from the end of runway. Most of the fuselage section was destroyed by post-impact fire. The remaining part of the fuselage was only the tail section. Both engines detached from the aircraft due to the impact to the ground. The right engine was found about 300 m and the left engine about 400 m from the end of the Runway 23.|$|E

6000|$|We {{passed the}} mortal {{remains of a}} gorilla lashed to a pole; the most {{interesting}} parts had been sold to Mr. R. B. N. Walker, and {{were on their way}} to England. I was shown for the first time the Ndámbo, or Ndambié (Bowdich, [...] "Olamboo"), which gives the india rubber of commerce; it is not a fat-leaved fig-tree (Ficus elastica of Asia) nor aeuphorbia (Siphonia elastica), as in South America, but a large climbing ficus, a cable thick as a man's leg crossing the path, and [...] "swarming up" [...] to the top of the tallest boles; the yellow fruit is tart and pleasant to the taste. In 1817 the style of collecting the gum (olamboo) was to spread with a knife the glutinous milk as it oozed from the tree over the shaved breast and arms like a plaister; it was then <b>taken</b> <b>off,</b> <b>rolled</b> up in balls to play with or stretched over drums, no other use being known. The Rev. Mr. Wilson declares (chap. ii.) that he [...] "first discovered the gum elastic, which has been procured, as yet, only at Corisco, Gabun, and Kama." [...] In 1854, Mr. Thompson (p. 112) found it in the Mendi country, near Sherbro; he describes it as a vine with dense bark, which yields the gum when hacked, and which becomes soft and porous when old. The juice is milk-white, thick, and glutinous, soon stiffening, darkening, and hardening without aid of art. I should like to see the raw material tried for making waterproofs in the tropics, where the best vulcanized articles never last. The Ndámbo tree has been traced a hundred miles inland from the Liberian Coast; that of the Gallinas and Sherbro is the best; at St. Paul's River it is not bad; but on the Junk River it is sticky and little prized. The difficulty everywhere is to make the negro collect it, and, when he does, to sell it un-adulterated: in East Africa he uses the small branches of the ficus for flogging canes, but will not take the trouble even to hack the [...] "Mpira" [...] tree.|$|R

60|$|The area in {{the middle}} of the Hippodrome is about one hundred yards long and fifty yards wide.

This water is ordinarily covered with planks, and the planks are covered with a very thick canvas carpet, and this with sand; so that the water is entirely concealed, and the horsemen ride over it just as they do over any other part of the area. When they wish to use it, to show how the horses could leap over streams, they <b>take</b> <b>off</b> the sand, <b>roll</b> up the carpet, and carry away the planks; and there they have a very good representation of a stream.|$|R

After this Ned again smeared himself over with mud, and sat down in the sun to dry.

5000|$|Simon Gibbons is {{believed}} to have been born at Forteau, Newfoundland and Labrador, on June 21, 1851, to Thomas Gibbons, a fisherman, and an Inuit woman who died giving birth. [...] Some stories, possibly legends later circulated by Gibbons, have him found as a child on an ice-floe off the coast of Labrador. [...] The first document about Gibbons shows him as a six-year-old child admitted to the Church of England Widows and Orphans Asylum in St John’s in 1857 upon the death of his father, along with three brothers and a sister in law. [...] Three years later, Gibbons entered a school run by the Reverend George Poulett Harris, and the promising student was also taught by a Reverend Mr Hutchinson at Tilt Cove. [...] In 1862, Gibbons was <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> the orphanage <b>rolls,</b> because he was taken by a clergy widow, Sophia Mountain, lady superintendent of the asylum.

In 1875, Gibbons moved to Quebec to work as a lay reader, teacher and catechist, as well as to tutor the son of the Clarenceville rector for admission to the university.
