40|$|This paper {{describes}} the production technology of oil-furnace carbon black, {{as well as}} the selected solution for preventing the emissions of this process from contaminating the environment. The products of industrial oil-furnace carbon black production are different grades of carbon black and process <b>tail</b> <b>gases.</b> The qualitative composition of these <b>tail</b> <b>gases</b> during the production of oil-furnace carbon black are: carbon(IV) oxide, carbon(II) oxide, hydrogen, methane, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen, oxygen, and water vapor. The quantitative composition and lower caloric value of process <b>tail</b> <b>gases</b> change {{depending on the type of}} feedstock used in the production, {{as well as the}} type of process. The lower caloric value of process <b>tail</b> <b>gases</b> is relatively small with values ranging between 1500 and 2300 kJ m– 3. In the conventional production of oil-furnace carbon black, process <b>tail</b> <b>gases</b> purified from carbon black dust are freely released into the atmosphere untreated. In this manner, the process <b>tail</b> <b>gases</b> pollute the air in the town of Kutina, because their quantitative values are much higher than the prescribed emissions limits for hydrogen sulfide and carbon(II) oxide. A logical solution for the prevention of such air pollution is combustion of the process <b>tail</b> <b>gases,</b> i. e. their thermal oxidation. For this purpose, a specially designed flare system has been developed. Consuming minimum amounts of natural gas needed for oxidation, the flare system is designed to combust low caloric process <b>tail</b> <b>gases</b> with 99 % efficiency. Thus, the toxic and flammable components of the <b>tail</b> <b>gases</b> (hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen, carbon(II) oxide, methane and other trace hydrocarbons) would be transformed into environmentally acceptable components (sulfur(IV) oxide, water, carbon(IV) oxide and nitrogen(IV) oxide), which are in compliance with the emissions limit values prescribed by law. Proper operation of this flare system in the production of oil-furnace carbon black would solve the air pollution problem in the town of Kutina, especially the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide in the troposphere. Together with the development of this flare system, a continuous air-pollutant (hydrogen sulfide and carbon(II) oxide) monitoring system shall be established and linked with the Environmental Protection Agenc...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tail</b> <b>gases</b> of low calorific value, {{which are}} the {{by-product}} of oil-furnace carbon black industrial production, can be efficiently used as energy before their final release into the atmosphere. Apart from being used mainly for heating dryers, production of steam, electricity, or flared, {{they can also be}} used as a substitute for fuel in the reactor for the production of oil-furnace carbon blacks, thus increasing the efficiency of the hydrocarbon raw feedstock. This technical paper represents the technical-technological solution for applying the waste heat of the low calorific <b>tail</b> <b>gases</b> in the reactor for the production of "hard" grade oil-furnace carbon blacks with savings of the hydrocarbon raw feedstock. The introduction of the preheated low calorific <b>tail</b> <b>gases</b> in the reactor for the production of "hard" grade oil-furnace carbon blacks is achieved by serial cascading of four fans. The system consists of fans designed to pneumatically transport the mixture of process <b>tail</b> <b>gases</b> and oil-furnace carbon black dust particles. This ensures a stable technological process for the introduction of the low calorific process <b>tail</b> <b>gases</b> into the reaction zone where the natural gas and preheated air are combusted. In the production of oil-furnace carbon black N 220, it is shown that by using low calorific process <b>tail</b> <b>gases</b> in the amount from 1000 to 2000 m 3 h– 1 per reactor, savings from 10 to 20 % of natural gas and simultaneously 7 to 9 % of the hydrocarbon raw feedstoks were achieved...|$|R
40|$|During the {{industrial}} {{production of oil}} furnace carbon black, <b>tail</b> <b>gases</b> containing oil-furnace carbon black dust particles are emitted to the atmosphere. In the carbon black plant, Petrokemija d. d., there are six exhaust stacks for <b>tail</b> <b>gases.</b> Each of them has installed process equipment for cleaning <b>tail</b> <b>gases.</b> Efficiency of cleaning mainly depends on equipment construction and cleaning technology. The vicinity of the town, quality of {{the air in the}} region of Kutina, regarding floating particles PM 10, and corporate responsibility for further enviromental improvement, imposes development of new methods that will decrease the emmision of oil-furnace carbon black dust particles in the air. Combining centrifugal percipitator and filter, special construction of cyclofilter for filtration of oil-furnace carbon black dust particles from <b>tail</b> <b>gases</b> by using PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) membrane filter bags, was designed. Developed filtration technique provides η = 99. 9 % efficiency of filtration. Construction part of the filter contains the newest generation of PTFE membrane filter bags with the ability of jet pulse cleaning. Using the PTFE membrane filter bags technology, filtration efficiency for oil-furnace carbon black dust particles in <b>tail</b> <b>gases</b> of maximum γ= 5 mgm- 3 can be achieved. The filtration efficiency was monitored continuously measuring the concentration of the oil-furnace carbon black dust particles in the <b>tail</b> <b>gases</b> with the help of in situ electronic probe. The accomplished filtration technology is the base for the installation of the PTFE membrane filter bags in the main operation filters which will provide better protection of the air in the town of Kutina against floating particles PM 10...|$|R

40|$|There are {{numerous}} of different inlet process factors in carbon black oil furnaces {{which must be}} continuously and automatically adjusted, due to stable quality of final product. The most important six inlet process factors in carbon black oil-furnaces are: 1. volume flow of process air for combustion 2. temperature of process air for combustion 3. volume flow of natural gas for insurance the necessary heat for thermal reaction of conversionthe hydrocarbon oil feedstock in oil-furnace carbon black 4. mass flow rate of hydrocarbon oil feedstock 5. type and quantity of additive for adjustment the structure of oil-furnace carbon black 6. quantity and position of the quench water for cooling the reaction of oil-furnace carbon black. The control of oil-furnace carbon black adsorption capacity is made with mass flow rate of hydrocarbon feedstock, {{which is the most}} important inlet process factor. Oil-furnace carbon black adsorption capacity in industrial process is determined with laboratory analyze of iodine adsorption number. It is shown continuously and automatically method for controlling iodine adsorption number in carbon black oil-furnaces to get as much as possible efficient control of adsorption capacity. In the proposed method it can be seen the correlation between qualitatively-quantitatively composition of the process <b>tail</b> <b>gasses</b> in the production of oil-furnace carbon black and relationship between air for combustion and hydrocarbon feedstock. It is shown that the ratio between air for combustion and hydrocarbon oil feedstock is depended of adsorption capacity summarized by iodine adsorption number, regarding to BMCI index of hydrocarbon oil feedstock. The mentioned correlation can be seen through the figures from 1. to 4. From the whole composition of the process <b>tail</b> <b>gasses</b> the best correlation for continuously and automatically control of iodine adsorption number is show the volume fraction of methane. The volume fraction of methane in the process <b>tail</b> <b>gasses</b> is increased with the decreasing values of iodine adsorption number of the oil-furnace carbon black which can be seen through the Figs. 5. and 6.

50|$|Today, {{refineries}} {{are struggling}} {{to find ways to}} dispose of their increasing amount of sulfurous streams and waste products. Large amounts of high-sulfur residuals, particularly heavy oil and petroleum coke, are being produced and sold as fuel to the marine market or the cement industry. These off-take markets are, however, changing due to environmental constraints, and new markets have to be identified. One attractive option would be to use these residual fuels to produce power and steam, leaving behind the issue of emissions to be addressed. The SNOX technology is especially suitable for cleaning flue gases from combustion of high-sulfur fuels in refineries. The SNOX process is a very energy-efficient way to convert the NOx in the flue gas into nitrogen and the SOx into concentrated sulfuric acid of commercial quality without using any absorbents and without producing waste products or waste water. Along with the flue gases, other sulfurous waste streams from a refinery can be treated, such as H2S gas, SWS gas, Claus <b>tail</b> <b>gas</b> and elemental sulfur, potentially turning this technology into a complete sulfur management system.|$|E
