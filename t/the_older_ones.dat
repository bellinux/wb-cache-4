5|$|The {{result of}} proper {{neuronal}} migration through the cortical plate (CP) is an inside-out arrangement of neurons, where the younger neurons migrate past the older neurons to their proper locations. Studies in reeler mutant mice show that knocking out the reeler gene results in aberrant migration {{as well as}} outside-in layering, in which younger neurons are unable to travel past <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>ones.</b> Such abnormal layering is also seen in VLDLR−apoER2− and dab1- mutants, indicating {{the importance of this}} entire pathway in cortical migration of the developing embryo.|$|E
5|$|By 1957 {{the synagogue}} sanctuary, {{which had been}} {{designed}} for 350 families, had become too small to accommodate Temple Israel's over 1,100 member families. In addition, since the 1950s Memphis's Jewish community had been steadily moving from the downtown, where Temple Israel's Poplar Avenue building was located, to the eastern suburbs; by 1957 {{over half of the}} members, and three-quarters of those with children in the congregational school, lived there. School attendance increased rapidly, and the student body soon outgrew its 1951 building. The school had to split attendance in 1959, with the younger children attending on Saturday and <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>ones</b> on Sunday, and by 1961, 780 children were enrolled. In the early 1960s, Temple Israel began holding weekday classes at Beth Sholom, which was closer to most members.|$|E

5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} is a gregarious {{animal with}} a complex social structure comprising three distinct groups : firstly, the female herds, consisting of adult females and their young; secondly, the bachelor herds, consisting only of yearlings and older males; thirdly, the territorial bulls. The number of females per herd is variable, generally ranging from 14 to 32, but is {{highest in the}} densest populations and also increases with forage density. There is a strong attachment {{among members of the}} female herd, many of whom are related to each other. Large herds often get divided into smaller groups. While small calves stay with their mothers, <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>ones</b> form groups of their own within the herd. These herds have a social hierarchy, and the females are rather aggressive towards others trying to join the group. Young males are generally repelled by their mothers before the calving season starts. Separation of a young calf from its mother can be a major cause of calf mortality. While some male yearlings stay within the female herd, the others join a bachelor herd. These are usually loose associations and, unlike the female herds, the individuals are not much attached to each other. Another difference between the female and bachelor herds is the lesser aggression {{on the part of the}} males. These bachelor herds move widely in the available habitat and act as a refuge for males that have been unsuccessful as territorial bulls, and also as a reserve for future breeding males.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> were a {{race that}} had evolved even earlier than the Necrontyr, but along {{substantially}} different lines. Where the Necrontyr developed purely on science and technology, leaving spirituality and mysticism in the dark annals of their history, <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> embraced both science and their spirituality. In their alternate philosophies and mystic practices, <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> eventually gained access to the primordial Warp, but not the Warp {{as it is known}} in the 41st Millennium. In the days of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones,</b> <b>the</b> Warp was a shining parallel reality where emotions, thoughts, and even dreams were intensely reflected and molded together. Through natural fluency and masterful concentration, <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> used <b>the</b> Warp to become a civilization of powerful psykers, with supernatural abilities far exceeding any other sentient race in the galaxy. These abilities gave <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> a harmonious bond with (as well as control over) great cosmic forces, bestowing onto them the gift of immortality and near-omniscience. It is not known why <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> refused to trade or even interact with the expanding Necrontyr empire at the time, however their continual refusal to share their knowledge, most especially on the secrets of immortality, would eventually garner the enmity of the short-lived Necrontyr. This simmering hatred was used as a basis by the Triarchs to wage war with <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> created two massive gates at {{the poles}} that allowed instant {{transport}} between the Warhammer world and wherever <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> came from. Later, {{in the coming}} of Chaos, <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> either went missing, or sacrificed themselves to try to destroy the polar gates and halt the never-ending tide of Chaos in a cataclysmic explosion. Every race formed by <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> fought against <b>the</b> threat of Chaos, including the great armies of the Lizardmen which consisted of billions of Saurus. After the wars, the Slann immediately put defences and wards in place to better contain the threat of Chaos.|$|R

25|$|As the {{congregation}} had dwindled to 35 members, its board began to explore formally becoming a Conservative or Reform synagogue.

50|$|The {{history of}} the Lizardmen begins {{with the arrival of}} <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> in <b>the</b> Warhammer world; some of the Slann {{traveled}} among the stars with their godlike masters. When <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> arrived on <b>the</b> Warhammer world, they settled in Lustria where they created the Sub species of the Lizardmen (Saurus, Skinks and Kroxigors) from creatures already living there as servants that would help the Slann to fulfill the Plan of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones.</b> During this time, generations of Slann were spawned on the earth as it was being shaped to how <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> wished it. Armies of Saurus destroyed unwanted races, and <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> created <b>the</b> races of Elves (powerful magicians), Dwarfs (magic resistant), and Men. Sometime during the earliest days of the Warhammer world, the Orcs and Goblins came into being, probably the result of some interstellar spore or parasite that had hitched a ride on <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Ones' ship. They were not part of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> Plan, but despite many attempts to exterminate this parasitic race, the Greenskins survived, and to this day, they are the bane of the civilised races.|$|R

25|$|Ferguson joined Aberdeen {{as manager}} in June 1978, {{replacing}} Billy McNeill {{who had only}} managed the club for one season before he was offered the chance to manage Celtic.

The team had been playing well, however, and had not lost a league match since the previous December, having {{finished second in the}} league the previous season. Ferguson had now been a manager for four years, but was still not much older than some of the players and had trouble winning the respect of some of <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>ones</b> such as Joe Harper.

25|$|While {{awaiting}} the long-ballyhooed communist spring offensive, the U.S. improved its forward air control procedures. Lacking the institutional memory to recall prior experience during World War II, the Americans reinvented all-weather bombing and night FAC operations. Newer radio jeeps with 12 channels replaced <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>ones</b> that had only four. Ordnance specialists began loading proximity fused bombs matched to specific targets. Forward airfields were opened to stage aircraft {{closer to the}} enemy. When the communist offensive began on 22 April 1951, the 337,000 attacking troops disregarded UN air power and paid a heavy price for it. Tactical aviation from three aircraft carriers became available for close air support on 18 May. In mid-May, radar guided night air strikes killed communist troops within 400 yards of the U.S. 2nd Division, to General Almond's delight. However, even with copious air support, the UN forces gave ground until the communist attack petered out. Then they counter-attacked. Although they drove the communists back, {{for the first time}} the latter did not withdraw out of artillery range as usual to regroup, but clung in place. On 1 July 1951, North Korean Premier Kim Il Sung and General Peng Te-huai agreed to a cease fire as both sides settled into fixed positions. As the communists dug in, there were fewer and less worthy targets vulnerable to tactical air strikes.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} well {{received}} by critics such as Derek Strange of RPGFan, who {{described it as}} a [...] "must-have soundtrack" [...] and complimented Ito in both arranging tracks from Romancing SaGa [...] "to both sterling and awesome heights" [...] and in composing new tracks that blended well with <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>ones.</b> Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online agreed, saying that it exceeded expectations and was Ito's [...] "finest work to date".

50|$|One {{of the few}} races <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> {{encountered}} {{that were}} already sentient without their intervention were the Necrontyr. Where <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> were long-lived, with an average lifespan lasting for many Terran millennia, and had access to technology {{that allowed them to}} travel from settled world to world instantaneously through a network of Warpgates called the Webway, the Necrontyr were short-lived, and were bound to but one world. The Necrontyr grew increasingly jealous of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones,</b> and eventually set about going to war with them to wipe them out and claim their technology. <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> easily outmaneuvered these early, clumsy Necrontyr strikes by making use of their Webway, and the Necrontyr were soon defeated.|$|R

5000|$|This is {{also the}} first novel in the series which {{prominently}} features a somewhat divine opposition against <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones,</b> with <b>the</b> introduction of the Librarian.

It is obvious he is there to combat <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones.</b> This marks a significant change because {{in the first three}} novels <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> had seemingly invincible power and the Five had to face them themselves with no help.|$|R
500|$|While Disney animators have {{occasionally}} {{inserted a}} Disney character into background shots, for example, Donald Duck {{appears in a}} crowd in The Little Mermaid, they have avoided [...] "mingling characters" [...] from other Disney films for fear of weakening their individual mythologies. In Enchanted, characters from past Disney films are openly seen, such as the appearances of Thumper and Flower from Bambi in the 2D animation portion of the film.

500|$|While {{receiving}} temporary repairs at Pearl Harbor in January 1942, Saratogas eight-inch turrets, barbettes {{and ammunition}} hoists were removed; they {{were replaced by}} four twin 38-caliber five-inch dual-purpose gun mounts in February at Bremerton. New barbettes were built and the ammunition hoists had to be returned from Pearl Harbor. The older 25-caliber five-inch guns were replaced {{at the same time}} by eight more dual-purpose guns in single mounts. As the new guns were heavier than <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>ones,</b> only two could be added to the corner gun platforms; the space formerly used by the third gun on each platform was used by an additional quadruple 1.1-inch mount. In addition 32 Oerlikon 20 mm cannon were installed, six {{at the base of the}} funnel and the others distributed along the sides and rear of the flight deck. When the ship's repairs were completed in late May, her armament consisted of 16 five-inch guns, nine quadruple 1.1-inch gun mounts and 32 Oerlikon [...] guns.|$|E
500|$|The Order {{comes in}} either gold or silver {{depending}} on class, and the obverse features a white enameled cross pattée with gilt rays protruding {{from each of}} the arms. The rays are intersected diagonally by a pair of sabres when the recipient is awarded an Order [...] "with swords". Orders from the royal period contain a blue medallion at the centre depicting a Serbian cross with a fire-steel at each corner, with the words [...] "For Faith and Freedom, 1804" [...] etched into the small circle {{in the middle of the}} cross. The reverse of these Orders contains a red medallion depicting a white eagle, with the words [...] "Peter I, 1904" [...] written around it. The bravery medals awarded from June 1915 forward are almost identical to the Orders awarded before that date, save for the crossed swords being present on all of them regardless of class. Such Orders also lacked the phrase etched into the obverse of <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>ones</b> and the date 1904 on the reverse, which marked the centenary of the First Serbian Uprising. Instead, they merely had King Peter's name on the obverse beside the year when the Order was bestowed. The Orders themselves were originally manufactured by foreign makers of decorations and medals, such as France's Arthus-Bertrand and Switzerland's Huguenin Fréres; during the interwar period (1919–39) they were produced domestically.|$|E
