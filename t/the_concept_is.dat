5|$|The BK Whopper Bar {{is limited}} service concept created by Burger King in 2009. Whopper Bars are smaller footprint, {{specialized}} stores with a menu {{limited to the}} company's Whopper, crispy chicken sandwich and grilled chicken sandwich sandwiches; drinks; and desserts. The menu features higher-end ingredients and variants not sold in the normal Burger King locations. <b>The</b> <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> similar to the McCafe concept from rival McDonald's, and like the McCafe locations {{they are designed to}} go into airports, casinos, and other areas with limited amounts of space.|$|E
5|$|Beyoncé and {{her mother}} {{introduced}} House of Deréon, a contemporary women's fashion line, in 2005. <b>The</b> <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> inspired by three generations of women in their family, with the name paying tribute to Beyoncé's grandmother, Agnèz Deréon, a respected seamstress. According to Tina, the overall style of the line best reflects her and Beyoncé's taste and style. Beyoncé {{and her mother}} founded their family's company Beyond Productions, which provides the licensing and brand management for House of Deréon, and its junior collection, Deréon. House of Deréon pieces were exhibited in Destiny's Child's shows and tours, during their Destiny Fulfilled era. The collection features sportswear, denim offerings with fur, outerwear and accessories that include handbags and footwear, and are available at department and specialty stores across the US and Canada.|$|E

Probably <b>the</b> most potential <b>concept</b> will <b>be</b> {{a combination of all}} these concepts, because hybrid systems are always more or less dependent on structure of buildings. The bases of <b>the</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>are</b> efficient and demand based use of low pressure fans. <b>The</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>are</b> equipped with IR- and CO 2 -sensors to guarantee the efficient usage of energy. <b>The</b> <b>concepts</b> have <b>been</b> carried out with individual control of indoor air temperature, so they fit well both to open-plan and cellular office types, and make the flexibility possible.

5|$|Euler proved Newton's identities, Fermat's little theorem, Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares, {{and he made}} {{distinct}} {{contributions to}} Lagrange's four-square theorem. He also invented the totient function φ(n), the number of positive integers {{less than or equal}} to the integer n that are coprime to n. Using properties of this function, he generalized Fermat's little theorem to what is now known as Euler's theorem. He contributed significantly to the theory of perfect numbers, which had fascinated mathematicians since Euclid. He proved that the relationship shown between perfect numbers and Mersenne primes earlier proved by Euclid was one-to-one, a result otherwise known as the Euclid–Euler theorem. Euler also conjectured the law of quadratic reciprocity. <b>The</b> <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> regarded as a fundamental theorem of number theory, and his ideas paved the way for the work of Carl Friedrich Gauss.|$|E
5|$|In early 2006, Sony {{released}} {{a remake of}} Lemmings for the PlayStation Portable, developed by Team17. It features all 120 levels from the original game, 36 brand-new levels as well as DataPack support (similar to the Extra Track system featured in Wipeout Pure), and a user-level editor. Every level in the game is a pre-rendered 3D landscape, although their gameplay is still 2D and remains faithful to the original game. User levels can be constructed from pre-rendered objects and distributed by uploading them to a PlayStation-specific Lemmings online community. The soundtrack also marks the final video game score created by longtime composer Tim Follin after he announced his retirement from the industry in mid-2005. In October 2006 the game was ported by developer Rusty Nutz for the PlayStation 2 with use of the EyeToy. The basic change in <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> that the player must stretch and use his/her limbs in the recorded picture to aid the lemmings. In 2007, Team17 produced a similar remake of Lemmings for the PlayStation 3 for download through the PlayStation Network. The game has the similar graphical improvements as the PSP title, as well as on-line scoreboards and additional levels developed for high-definition display, but lacks {{the ability to create}} and share levels as the PSP version offers. Another remake, Lemmings Touch, was released for PlayStation Vita on 27 May 2014, developed by d3t Ltd.|$|E

25|$|The North American Union (NAU) is a {{theoretical}} {{economic and political}} continental union of Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America. <b>The</b> <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> loosely based on the European Union, occasionally including a common currency called the Amero or the North American Dollar.
