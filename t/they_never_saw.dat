25|$|In July 1916, {{because of}} border raids {{conducted}} by Pancho Villa and the courting of an unstable Mexican government by Germany, President Woodrow Wilson used his new legal authority {{to mobilize the}} nation's entire National Guard for patrol duty on the U.S.- Mexican border. The Minnesota Guard was sent to Camp Llano Grande near Mercedes, Texas. Although <b>they</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> fighting, their border duty helped prepare them for a much bigger challenge: World War I.|$|E

He claimed a co-op apartment in Bedford Park as his district residence. Several residents of the Bronx co-op said <b>they</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> him there. The Bronx County District Attorney opened an investigation, and the resulting media attention forced Espada to move into his vacant Bronx apartment.|$|E
25|$|In mid-August, {{four months}} into his Florida sojourn, Ben {{returned}} to Tennessee for a week. His parents and girlfriend, Emily Greer, said he seemed optimistic. He {{told them he}} was working on getting certified as an instructor so he could find a job and that he was researching cave diving with an eye toward getting that certification as well. On his nights out with Greer, he told her of plans to eventually start a diving-related business. On the weekend of August 14–15, he returned to Florida, leaving behind a letter thanking his parents for the sabbatical and promising to look after them as they grew older. <b>They</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> him again.|$|E
25|$|In 1883 {{her father}} died, leaving her a modest {{inheritance}} to live on. She continued taking minor roles at the Folly, but changed her stage name back to Florence Farr {{when she began}} performing at the Gaiety Theatre in May. Her commanding presence and beautiful speaking voice were noted by Shaw. She soon attained modest success on London's West End stages. In 1884 she married fellow actor Edward Emery. It {{turned out to be}} a disastrous marriage, and she chafed under the restrictions expected of a Victorian wife. In 1888, her husband left for an extended tour of America, and <b>they</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> each other again. She eventually obtained a divorce in 1895 on the grounds of abandonment and never remarried.|$|E

25|$|No signs, tracks or {{anything}} tangible or visible {{of the alleged}} animals was seen or shown whatsoever. Tracks, droppings, and other signs of forest elephants and gorillas were commonly seen, as well as crocodiles in the lake. Despite {{the fact that the}} African guides were extremely capable and experienced hunters, guides and experts of the African rainforest, they were not able to show any track or sign of the Mokèlé-mbèmbé and none of the several interviewed guides even claimed ever to have seen one personally, nor its tracks. Remarkable {{is the fact that the}} guides that were interviewed by the Dutch expedition and that also accompanied Regusters, stated that <b>they</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> a Mokèlé-mbèmbé during that expedition, although Regusters himself claims to have seen one.|$|E
25|$|The first European {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} Armstrong Township in 1773. Thomas Hartley, Michael Graybill, George Leffler, and John Kern all received warrants for land on February 11, 1773. Hartley then purchased {{the properties of}} Graybill, Leffler and Kern on March 31, 1773. This was to avoid a Province of Pennsylvania law that stated that no one man could purchase more than one tract of land. Marcus Huling {{appears to have been}} the first permanent settler in Mosquito Valley, which makes up the greatest portion of Armstrong Township. Huling settled in the eastern portion of Mosquito Valley, near where Culbertson's Path crossed. Huling and family cleared land, built a cabin, a sawmill, and distillery in 1795. Huling's son, Thomas, carried on the family businesses until his death. Interestingly, although the Huling's were apparently successful businessmen, <b>they</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> fit to settle their debt on the land that they had developed. Upon Thomas Huling's death, the land was foreclosed and was left to be reclaimed by nature until the arrival of German farmers in 1832.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{favorable}} reviews, the book met with criticism from adult film industry insiders, {{some of whom}} accused Lords of lying. Co-workers from that time such as John Leslie, Ron Jeremy, Ginger Lynn and Tom Byron said <b>they</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> her use drugs and insisted she was always fully aware of her actions. One of her co-workers from that time, Christy Canyon, said about Lords' autobiography, [...] "I think her book could have been fabulous, except that she was lying throughout the whole thing." ...|$|E

Ford was not aware of his biological father until he was 17, when his parents told him about the circumstances of his birth. That year his biological father, whom Ford described as a [...] "carefree, well-to-do man who didn't really give a damn about the hopes and dreams of his firstborn son", approached Ford while he was waiting tables in a Grand Rapids restaurant. The two [...] "maintained a sporadic contact" [...] until Leslie King, Sr.'s death in 1941.|$|E

500|$|No. 4 Service Flying Training School (No.4 SFTS) was {{a flying}} {{training}} {{school of the}} Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World WarII. [...] It was formed in February 1941, and commenced flying the following month. Responsible for intermediate and advanced instruction of pilots under the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), the school was based at Geraldton, Western Australia, and operated Avro Anson aircraft. Two reserve squadrons were formed {{in response to the}} outbreak of war in the Pacific, though <b>they</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> action. Flying activity was reduced towards the end of 1943, and the school was disbanded in May 1945, having graduated over 1,000 pilots. It [...] re-formed as No.87 Operational Base Unit, which was renamed Care and Maintenance Unit (CMU) Geraldton in May 1946. [...] CMU Geraldton was disbanded in September 1947.|$|E
500|$|The {{photography}} for {{the album}} was handled by drummer Shannon Leto, with additional works provided by Ken Schles. The cover art features a teenage boy {{and some of the}} band's symbolism. It includes a phoenix logo, named [...] "Mithra" [...] by the band, that bears the motto [...] "Provehito in Altum". Roughly translated from Latin, the phrase means [...] "Launch forth into the deep". The band chose a phoenix for its association with rebirth and renewal in the Greek mythology. The group expressed interest in signs and symbols and their relationships with cultures and subcultures. The album's cover art was unveiled through the band's official website on July 29, 2002. However, it was not conceived to be the original concept for the artwork. The initial cover art was discontinued and destroyed during production following the September 11 attacks due to the graphic content of the image. It featured a fighter pilot ejecting from an exploding plane. Thirty Seconds to Mars explained that <b>they</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> it as a violent image, but felt that it was inappropriate {{in the wake of the}} events.|$|E
500|$|Saint-Saëns {{was elected}} to the Institut de France in 1881, at his second attempt, having to his chagrin been beaten by Massenet in 1878. In July of that year he and his wife went to the Auvergnat spa town of La Bourboule for a holiday. On 28 July he {{disappeared}} from their hotel, and a few days later his wife received a letter from him to say {{that he would not be}} returning. <b>They</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> each other again. Marie Saint-Saëns returned to her family, and lived until 1950, dying near Bordeaux at the age of ninety-five. Saint-Saëns did not divorce his wife and remarry, nor did he form any later intimate relationship with a woman. Rees comments that although there is no firm evidence, some biographers believe that Saint-Saëns was more attracted to his own sex than to women. After the death of his children and collapse of his marriage, Saint-Saëns increasingly found a surrogate family in Fauré and his wife, Marie, and their two sons, to whom he was a much-loved honorary uncle. Marie told him, [...] "For us you are one of the family, and we mention your name ceaselessly here." ...|$|E

500|$|Tulloch's {{approach}} has undoubtedly resulted in outcomes {{that would not}} have been possible otherwise. In 1991, he presented Edith Brown Haisman, a 96-year-old survivor of the disaster, with her father's pocket watch which had been retrieved from the sea bed. She had last seen it on 15 April 1912 when he waved goodbye to his wife and daughter as they left aboard lifeboat 14. <b>They</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> him again and he presumably went down with the ship. The watch was loaned to Haisman [...] "for life"; when she died four years later it was reclaimed by RMS Titanic Inc. On another occasion, a steamer trunk spotted in the debris field was found to contain three musical instruments, a deck of playing cards, a diary belonging to one Howard Irwin, and a bundle of letters from his girlfriend Pearl Shuttle. It was first thought that Irwin, a musician and professional gambler, had boarded the ship under a false identity. There was no record of him being among the passengers, even though a ticket had been purchased for him. It turned out that he had stayed ashore but his trunk had been brought aboard the ship by his friend Henry Sutehall, who was among the victims of the disaster. The fragile contents of the trunk were preserved due to the interior being starved of oxygen, which prevented bacteria from consuming the paper. Very few other shipwrecks have yielded readable paper.|$|E
500|$|In January Sylvia {{was summoned}} to Paris, where Emmeline and Christabel were waiting. Their mother had just {{returned}} from another tour of the US, and Sylvia had just been released from prison. All three women were exhausted and stressed, which added considerably to the tension. In her 1931 book The Suffrage Movement Sylvia describes Christabel as an unreasonable figure, haranguing her for refusing to toe the WSPU line:She turned to me. [...] "You have your own ideas. We do not want that; we want all our women to take their instructions and walk in step like an army!" [...] Too tired, too ill to argue, I made no reply. I was oppressed by a sense of tragedy, grieved by her ruthlessness. Her glorification of autocracy seemed to me remote indeed from the struggle we were waging, the grim fight even now proceeding in the cells. I thought of many others who had been thrust aside for some minor difference.With their mother's blessing, Christabel ordered Sylvia's group to dissociate from the WSPU. Pankhurst tried to persuade the ELFS to remove the word [...] "suffragettes" [...] from its name, since it was inextricably linked to the WSPU. When Sylvia refused, her mother switched to fierce anger in a letter:You are unreasonable, always have been & I fear always will be. I suppose you were made so!... Had you chosen a name which we could approve we could have done much to launch you & advertise your society by name. Now you must take your own way of doing so. I am sorry but you make your own difficulties by an incapacity to look at situations from other people's point of view as well as your own. Perhaps in time you will learn the lessons that we all have to learn in life.Adela, unemployed and unsure of her future, had become a worry for Pankhurst as well. She decided that Adela should move to Australia, and paid for her relocation. <b>They</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> one another again.|$|E

50|$|Helton eschewed the program's long-time {{reliance}} on local talent and instead began heavily recruiting junior college players from Florida, Georgia and Mississippi. By doing so, Helton effectively severed the program's {{ties to the}} local high schools that had long been the lifeblood of UH football. Indeed, many local high school coaches claimed that <b>they</b> <b>never</b> even <b>saw</b> Helton during his seven-year tenure as head coach. This was a dramatic change for a program that had historically featured national powers built around Houston-area talent.|$|R
50|$|At first The Haters did {{not care}} what the sound on the tape was {{as long as it}} was constant. Otherwise they had no other {{interest}} in sound on their stage for years.
