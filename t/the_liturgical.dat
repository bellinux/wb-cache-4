5|$|On {{the eve of}} the Feast of Saint Jovan Vladimir, {{an all-night}} vigil is celebrated in the churches {{dedicated}} to the saint, as is celebrated in other Orthodox churches on the eves of their patron saints' feasts. <b>The</b> <b>liturgical</b> celebration of Vladimir's feast day begins on the evening of 21May, because, in the Orthodox Church, <b>the</b> <b>liturgical</b> day is reckoned from one evening to the next. Despite the name of the service, the all-night vigil is usually not held throughout the entire night, and may last only for two hours. In the Church of StJovan Vladimir near Elbasan, it lasts from 9 pm to 3 am. Hymns either to Jovan Vladimir or to another saint whose commemoration falls on 22May, are chanted, on that liturgical day, at set points during services in all Orthodox churches.|$|E

5|$|The College of Cardinals {{originated}} {{from the college}} of the main clergy {{of the city of}} Rome. The title of cardinal initially concerned only the priests of the 28 parochial churches of the Eternal City (tituli), who were required to assist the pope in <b>the</b> <b>liturgical</b> service in the four Basilicas of Rome (Vatican Basilica, Liberian Basilica, Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls and San Lorenzo fuori le Mura). Later (probably in the 8th century) the term was extended to the bishops of the seven dioceses bordering the diocese of Rome: Ostia, Porto, Albano, Palestrina, Silva Candida (1079 replaced by Segni), Gabii-Lavicum (whose name later changed to Tusculum, and later to Frascati) and Velletri (after 1060 replaced by Sabina). These bishops (cardinal-bishops) performed <b>the</b> <b>liturgical</b> service in the Lateran Basilica. Finally, the deacons serving in the papal household or heading the ecclesiastical regions of the city (and later attached to the churches called deaconries), also became the cardinals (cardinal-deacons).|$|E
