5|$|Rio de Janeiro bid to {{host the}} 1936, 2004 and the 2012 Games, but failed on every occasion; missing the {{shortlist}} in the two latest attempts, while the bidding process for 1936 did not follow the current standards. For {{the first time in}} the Candidature phase, the official bid flag was raised during a ceremony held at the Palácio da Cidade (English: City's Palace) on June 23, 2008, celebrating the Olympic Day. On July 3, 2008, the Rio de Janeiro bid committee paid a fee of USD 500,000 to the IOC and signed the Candidature Procedure, reconfirming its acceptance of the rules. Then, Rio officials participated in the Olympic Games Observers Program from August 8 to 24, during the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China; and attended the IOC Official Debriefing of the Beijing Games from November 24 to 27, in London, United Kingdom. On February 11, 2009, the Rio de Janeiro bid committee delivered its Candidature File to the IOC in Lausanne and, eight days later, to the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) in Bonn, Germany; containing <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2016 Candidature Procedure and Questionnaire, as well as guarantees and undertakings. The Candidature File had three volumes containing 568 pages of detailed answers to 300 technical questions, divided into 17 themes. Finally, on June 17, 2009, the IOC organized the 2016 Candidate Cities Briefing to 93 of its members at the Olympic Museum, being the first such meeting in its history and the most important before the election. Rio officials came out stronger after a presentation of 45 minutes, considered to be exceptional, followed by a session of 16 questions.|$|E

This strategy recognizes that decisions on global warming {{need to be made}} with incomplete information, and that decisions in the near term will have potentially long-term impacts. Governments might choose to use risk management as part of their policy response to global warming. For instance, a risk-based approach can be applied to climate impacts which are difficult to quantify in economic terms, e.g., the impacts of global warming on indigenous peoples.|$|E

500|$|Inspired by <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> short film, Robespierre {{decided to}} expand the story into a feature film, and wrote an {{extended}} screenplay with Karen Maine and Elisabeth Holm. Although the writers wanted to [...] "stick as close ... as possible" [...] to the original story and characters, they changed the lead character's profession to stand-up comedy. The film's stand-up scenes were written by Robespierre, who tried to emulate Jenny Slate's style of comedy, and were revised by Slate and Gabe Liedman, another comedian, who also volunteered their own material. The script was written over an 18-month period before Robespierre and Holm began to seek financiers to fund the film's production; they started sending the script to potential financiers in November 2012. It was financed {{through a variety of}} sources, including the production companies Animal Kingdom Films, Rooks Nest Entertainment, Sundial Pictures and Votiv Films, as well as grants from Rooftop Films, the Tribeca Film Institute and the San Francisco Film Society.|$|E

2500|$|B. cephalotes has {{two main}} ways of {{detecting}} prey: tactile cues and olfactory cues. [...] The olfactory cues, however, {{do not seem}} to be very specific, as <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cue do not correspond strongly to preference of prey. The beetle, once in possession of its prey, holds the organism with its forelegs and tears off pieces of the organism to consume. [...] The mandibles are used to tear open the cuticular structures of its meal and expose the soft tissue areas within the organism. Fluid is produced in the mouth during feeding that causes the discoloration of flesh and begins the digestive process. This fluid is composed of a variety of enzymes that begin the digestive process before the prey has entered the beetle’s digestive tract. [...] Many samples of B. cephalotes were found to have sand in their digestive tract in addition to organisms. [...] Sand in the digestive tract may help the beetle grind up the tougher parts of the prey, although it has not yet been determined if the sand is ingested for this purpose.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{murder by}} {{numerous}} individuals and institutions, such as singer Nihat Doğan {{and the newspaper}} Yeni Akit were met with widespread condemnation outrage after being perceived to have defended rape {{on the grounds that}} mini-skirts provoked it. In a tweet deleted shortly after by Doğan, he claimed that the secular system has [...] "corrupted" [...] individuals and that women should not call out if they were being abused by such individuals and wearing a mini-skirt at the same time. The tweet resulted in him being withdrawn from the cast of the TV show Survivor, his manager cutting all business ties and his suspension from the Galatasaray sports club. Doğan eventually made a live apology on Beyaz TV. A group of lawyers filed a criminal complaint against Doğan in İzmir. The Conservative newspaper Yeni Akit blamed the murder on a [...] "western lifestyle" [...] and referred to the comments of pro-women's rights journalists such as Uğur Dündar as the main cause. Numerous tweets that appeared to condone the murder on religious grounds, including on the fact that Özgecan was of Alevi origin, also drew criticism.|$|E

The steps of this good man had been ordered him hither by Heaven's decree: to this almshouse! Here it was ordained that a life all love, and kindness, and honour, should end! I heard no more of prayers, and psalms, and sermon, after that. How dared I {{to be in a}} place of mark, and he, he yonder among the poor? Oh, pardon, you noble soul! I ask forgiveness of you for being of a world that has so treated you--you my better, you the honest, and gentle, and good!

40|$|When {{a letter}} and a tone are {{presented}} in rapid succession, there is substantial interference if both require an overt <b>response</b> (<b>the</b> dual-task paradigm), but {{there is very little}} interference if the tone is a signal <b>to</b> inhibit <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> letter (the slopping paradigm). These effects were replicated under common stimulus conditions in two experiments, and they were compared with effects in a change paradigm, in which the tone required an overt <b>response,</b> like <b>the</b> dual-task paradigm, but was also a signal <b>to</b> inhibit <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> letter, like the stopping paradigm. In the change paradigm, <b>the</b> overt <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tone suffered interference only if subjects failed <b>to</b> inhibit <b>the</b> concurrent <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> letter; inhibiting <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> letter virtually eliminated the interference. The results suggest that differences in response competition are primarily responsible for differences in interference between the dual-task and stopping paradigms. More generally, the results support response-competition interpretations of dual-task interference. In a typical dual-task experiment, people are presented with two stimuli in rapid succession and are required to respond to each stimulus as quickly as possible. Typically, there is substantial interference between the two tasks, particularly when th...|$|R

60|$|I happen'd {{to be at}} an eminent Place of God's most devout Worship {{the other}} Day, with a Gentleman of my Acquaintance, who, I observed, minded very little the Business he ought to come about; first I saw him always busy staring about him and bowing this Way and that Way, nay, he made two or three bows and Scrapes when he was repeating <b>the</b> <b>Responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ten Commandments, and assure you he made it {{correspond}} strangely, so that the Harmony was not so broken in upon {{as you would expect}} it should; thus; Lord, and a Bow to a fine Lady just come up to her Seat, have Mercy upon us; ---- three Bows to a Throng of Ladies that came into the next Pew altogether, and incline ---- then stop'd to make a great Scrape to my Lord ----, our Hearts, just then the Hearts of all the Church were gone off from the Subject, for the Response was over, so he huddled up the rest in Whispers, for God a Mighty could hear him well enough, he said, nay, as well as if he had spoken as loud as his Neighbours did.|$|E
60|$|And how many, my friends, {{when they}} come to church, harden their hearts in the same quiet, almost good-humoured way, not caring enough for God's message to be even angry with it, and take the preacher's {{warnings}} as they would a shower of rain, as something unpleasant which cannot be helped; and which, therefore, they must sit out patiently, and think about it as little as possible? And when the sermon is over, they take their hats and go out into the churchyard, and begin talking about something else as quickly as possible, to drive the unpleasant thoughts, if there are a few left, out of their heads. And thus they let the Lord's message to them harden their hearts. For it does harden them, my friends, if it be taken in this temper. Every time anyone sits through the service or the sermon in this stupid and careless mood, he dulls and deadens his soul, till at last he is able coolly to sit through the most awful warnings of God's judgment, the most tender entreaties of God's love, {{as if he were a}} brute animal without understanding. Ay, he is able to make <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> commandments, and join in the psalms, and so with his own mouth, before the whole congregation, confess that God's curse is on his doings, with no more sense or care of what the words mean, and of what a sentence he is pronouncing against himself, than if he were a parrot taught to speak by rote words which he does not understand. And so that man, by hardening his own heart, makes the Lord harden it for him.|$|E

These two SNPs were also studied in different ethnic groups (Brazilians, African and Caucasian) of HIV-infected, exposed uninfected and unexposed uninfected subjects. The HIV positive Caucasian patients were also characterized by different disease progressions.
