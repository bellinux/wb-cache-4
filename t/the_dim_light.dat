2500|$|President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, {{which took}} effect on January 1, 1863, {{declared}} {{the freedom of}} all slaves in Confederate-held territory. (Slaves in Union-held areas and Northern states were freed with {{the adoption of the}} 13th Amendment on December 6, 1865.) Douglass described the spirit of those awaiting the proclamation: [...] "We were waiting and listening as for a bolt from the sky ... we were watching ... by <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> of the stars for the dawn of a new day ... we were longing for the answer to the agonizing prayers of centuries." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{with both}} the {{original}} Dark Fall and the sequel, , Jonathan Boakes worked primarily alone on Lost Souls, writing, designing and programming the game, as well as voicing several characters, designing the sound effects (with Matt Clark), and composing the music (with Ben Gammons). Boakes has said he prefers working on the Dark Fall games without a development team as [...] "the worlds of Dowerton and Fetch Rock are created from an informed imagination, using textures and sounds from the world around me. I think {{a little of that}} personality would be lost if tackled by a small team." [...] Of Lost Souls, he felt working alone helped him establish the game's atmosphere of isolation; [...] "working alone in <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> of the Darkling Room {{is the best way to}} approach this game [...] It's an eerie, isolating experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 16, 1804, {{at seven}} o'clock in the evening under <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> of a waxing {{crescent}} moon, Intrepid slowly sailed into Tripoli harbor. Decatur's vessel was {{made to look like}} a common merchant ship from Malta and was outfitted with [...] To further avoid suspicion, on board were five Sicilian volunteers including the pilot Salvador Catalano, who spoke Arabic. The boarding party remained hidden below in position, prepared to board the captured Philadelphia. The men were divided into several groups, each assigned to secure given areas of the ship, with the additional explicit instruction of refraining from the use of firearms unless it proved absolutely necessary. As Decatur's ship came closer to Philadelphia, Catalano called out to the harbor personnel in Arabic that their ship had lost its anchors during a recent storm and was seeking refuge at Tripoli for repairs. By 9:30p.m. Decatur's ship was within 200 yards of Philadelphia, whose lower yards were now resting on the deck with her foremast missing, as Bainbridge had ordered it cut away and had also jettisoned some of her guns in a futile effort to refloat the ship by lightening her load.|$|E

60|$|De Batz {{stood and}} watched him {{for as long as}} <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>lights</b> of <b>the</b> street lamps illumined his slim, soberly-clad figure; then he turned on his heel and walked off in the {{opposite}} direction.|$|R
50|$|During satanic rituals black candles are {{the only}} lightsource, except for one white candle on <b>the</b> altar. <b>The</b> <b>dim</b> <b>lighting</b> is used to create an air of mystique {{and the color of}} the candles has {{symbolic}} meaning.|$|R

6000|$|... "Ay, Davy, Davy!" [...] they shouted, {{for they}} were in the mood for anything. There stood Colonel Clark in <b>the</b> <b>dimmer</b> <b>light</b> of <b>the</b> background. [...] "We must keep 'em screwed up, Davy," [...] he had said that very day.|$|R
60|$|Therefore, {{just before}} he saw <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>lights</b> of <b>the</b> {{lanterns}} disappearing down the road, which at this point makes a sharp dip before rising abruptly once more {{on the outskirts of}} the wood, Sir Marmaduke finally put his foot in the stirrup and started to follow.|$|R
50|$|Desert rainbow-skinks {{shelter in}} {{woodland}} leaf litter, feeding mainly on invertebrates.

5000|$|... #Caption: Brandon's [...] "passage to manhood". Peirce had {{intended}} the roller skate scene to be {{a metaphor for}} Brandon's formal entrance into masculinity. This image illustrates <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>lighting</b> used throughout <b>the</b> film, giving a particular emphasis on artificial light stemming from the film's focus on confined interiors.|$|R
5000|$|Because of <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>lighting,</b> most light {{entering}} {{from outside}} through the arch {{and lack of}} reference points, it appears shorter than it really is.

60|$|I {{remember}} how the engine-throbs beat through {{me like the}} beating of a heart, and that far below, among <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>lights</b> that came up from the emigrants in the steerage, there was a tinkling music as I prayed and a man's voice singing a plaintive air in some strange Slavonic tongue.|$|R

30|$|For the imaging, mice {{were placed}} on a gel cushion in a dark box. Each mouse was {{recorded}} in the supine and lateral positions. First, photographs of the mice were taken in <b>dimmed</b> <b>light.</b> Then bioluminescent images were taken with an exposure time of 10 Â s. <b>The</b> <b>dimmed</b> <b>light</b> images were merged with the corresponding bioluminescent images and the light emissions transformed into pseudocolours. Hamamatsu Simple PCI software was used for image processing.|$|R
60|$|I {{was able}} in a moment's lull to peer {{through the windows}} and see <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>lights</b> of Capri--the glimmer of Anacapri up on the black shadow--the lighthouse.

60|$|The train {{arrived at}} Benton after dark. And the {{darkness}} seemed a windy gulf {{out of which}} roared yellow lights and excited men. The tents, with <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>lights</b> through <b>the</b> canvas, gleamed pale and obscure, like {{so much of the}} life they hid. The throngs hurried, the dust blew, the band played, the barkers clamored for their trade.|$|R
60|$|The man's {{white face}} shone eagerly in <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> of the gloomy little apartment. His eyes glittered. He waited almost breathlessly.|$|E

60|$|It is an hallucination. That is a {{conclusion}} of common sense. I {{have watched the}} growth of it. At first {{it was only in}} <b>the</b> <b>dimmest</b> <b>light</b> that I could see him sitting in the chair. But as the time passed, and the hallucination, by repetition, strengthened, he was able to appear in the chair under the strongest lights. That is the explanation. It is quite satisfactory.|$|R
