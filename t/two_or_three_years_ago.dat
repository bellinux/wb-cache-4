Dilys Powell of The Sunday Times remarked {{after seeing the}} film that [...] "The cinema was a duller place before 007." [...] David Robinson of The Financial Times criticised the appearance of Connery and his effectiveness to play Bond in the film, remarking: [...] "It's not just that Sean Connery looks a lot more haggard and less heroic than he did <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> but there is much less effort to establish him as connoisseur playboy. Apart from the off-handed order for Beluga, there is little of that comic display of bon viveur-manship {{that was one of}} the charms of Connery's almost-a-gentleman 007." ...|$|E
500|$|Reception of [...] "The Food Wife" [...] {{from food}} critics has been mixed. Before the episode aired, Robert Sietsema of The Village Voice disapproved {{of it for}} being outdated. He commented that [...] "this show should have been done, say, <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> when food {{blogging}} was hot. By now, many food bloggers of our acquaintance have out-migrated to paying gigs, {{and the concept of}} the food blog has been co-opted by every major media outlet, rendering real food blogs – the old-fashioned kind, where someone stood alone in their kitchen cooking things, or wandered the hinterlands seeking out unique deliciousness – nearly obsolete." [...] Sietsema also criticized the scenes showcasing molecular gastronomy because he thought they were out of date, since molecular gastronomy is, [...] "by now, long past its prime". Chris Shott, a food critic for Washington City Papers Young & Hungry column and blog, wrote negatively about the character that owns El Chemistri and is a parody of José Andrés. He commented that [...] "For one thing, the character seems far more subdued than the kooky, wild-eyed power drill-wielding cook we saw on Conan recently. The satire here, involving a deconstructed Caesar salad of foams, gels and airs, is more a riff on molecular gastronomy in general than a send-up of Andrés' over-the-top personality." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005, the UNICEF charity record [...] was released; it is a {{collection}} of seventeen eclectic remixes of [...] "Army of Me". All profits went directly to the charity, to assist the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Live at Shepherds Bush Empire was released as a VHS in November, 1998, containing the last performance of the Post Tour, which took place at Shepherds Bush Empire in February 1997. Post Live, a live album consisting of songs recorded during the Post Tour, was included in the 2003 box set Live Box. The 2002 box set Family Tree includes demos and alternate versions of various tracks off the album. Post has been reissued several times, adapting to different formats such as colored records, 180g vinyl, and DualDisc. A remastered version of the album in surround sound was included in the box set Surrounded, which was released in 2006 on Elektra Records. In 2012, Universal Japan issued a limited edition of Debut and Post together as one compilation [...] In 2008, when asked how she felt about the album in retrospect, Björk reflected: [...] "I listened to [...] when we did the surround mixes of it like <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> and I have to say I was kinda surprised how the odd spastic thing of the album had actually aged well. I was very aware of it at the time that I needed to be musically promiscuous and have almost every song [...] different mood/style and so on." ...|$|E

In the book, Lee {{stated that}} Singaporean Muslims faced {{difficulties}} in integrating {{because of their}} religion, and urged them to [...] "be less strict on Islamic observances". His remarks drew firestorm from Malay/Muslim leaders and MPs in Singapore, prompting a strong reaction from his son Lee Hsien Loong, who's the current Prime Minister at that time as saying [...] "My views on Muslims’ integration in Singapore differed from the Minister Mentor's. Muslims are a valued and respected community, who have done a good deal to strengthen our harmony and social cohesion." [...] Lee Kuan Yew then told the media [...] "I made this one comment on the Muslims integrating with other communities probably <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Ministers and MPs, both Malay and non-Malay, have since told me that Singapore Malays have indeed made special efforts to integrate with the other communities, especially since 9/11, and that my call is out of date."
