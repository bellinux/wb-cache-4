40|$|Multichannel intraluminal {{impedance}} (MII) detects bolus {{flow through}} a healthy pharynx. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine whether the technique detects bolus flow and retention in patients with pharyngeal dysphagia; develop appropriate impedance-based criteria for assessing patients and to provide some preliminary insights into the clinical utility of the technique. Pharyngo-oesophageal pressure and impedance were recorded simultaneously with videofluoroscopy (VF) during swallows in six patients with dysphagia. Agreement, as to the presence or absence of bolus material, between the VF and MII was expressed using the Cohen's Kappa statistic. To test whether the impedance criteria for the detection of bolus passage in dysphagia could be improved, a Kappa statistic was calculated in an iterative process for a range of impedance values (100 %- 0 %) defining bolus head entry and bolus <b>tail</b> <b>clearance</b> from the pharynx. Bolus presence according to the MII criteria previously derived by us in healthy controls demonstrated a modest correlation with VF when applied to this dysphagia population [0. 37, 0. 5 and 0. 58 in the hypopharynx, upper oesophageal sphincter (UOS) and proximal oesophagus respectively]. In the patient population, the optimal impedance criteria were 50 % for bolus head entry and 20 % for bolus <b>tail</b> <b>clearance.</b> Adopting these criteria demonstrated enhanced agreement between VF and impedance; yielding Kappa coefficients of 0. 42 in the hypopharynx, 0. 54 in the UOS and 0. 62 in the proximal oesophagus. With the adoption of appropriate criteria, pharyngeal impedance measurement can accurately detect bolus passage and failed or impaired clearance during swallowing in patients with dysphagia. M. M.

40|$|The {{impedance}} {{criteria for}} the detection of the arrival of bolus head and clearance of bolus tail in the pharynx have not been defined, and may differ from accepted criteria used in the oesophagus. Our aim was to define the optimal impedance criteria that most accurately defined passage of the swallowed bolus moving through the pharyngo-oesophageal segment. In eight healthy volunteers, an assembly incorporating seven impedance-measuring segments was positioned across the pharyngo-oesophageal segment, and subjects swallowed liquid and semisolid radio-opaque boluses (2 - 20 mL) while impedance was simultaneously recorded with videofluoroscopic images. To derive the optimal criteria, in an iterative process we correlated impedance defined bolus presence with fluoroscopy (Cohen's Kappa) for a range of impedance cut-off values from 100 % to 0 % for both the initial fall, and recovery of impedance. Bolus presence in the pharynx, as determined by the 'standard' criteria (50 % drop and recovery to 50 % of baseline), correlated very modestly with videofluoroscopy (kappa approximately 0. 35). The criteria that most accurately defined bolus passage varied between pharyngeal regions. Threshold (% of baseline) for bolus head entry into the region ranged from 71 % to 80 %. Threshold for bolus <b>tail</b> <b>clearance</b> varied from nadir to 19 %. Correlation of impedance with videofluoroscopy improved to kappa approximately 0. 6 with the above criteria. The impedance criteria defining bolus presence across the pharyngo-oesophageal segment differ from those adopted in the oesophagus.

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{supersonic}} aircraft are liable to possess some trim drag under cruise conditions. Fuselage camber has been suggested as one means of reducing this component of the drag, {{and the purpose of}} this investigation was to obtain quantitative data on the pitching moment increments obtainable from fuselage camber and incidence, and the associated increments in fuselage drag. Lift, drag and moment measurements have been made on a body representative of the fuselage of a supersonic transport aeroplane. The fineness ratio of the body was 15 : 1, the cross-sectional area distribution being of modified Sears-Haack form. Parabolic nose and tail camber was used, the nose and tail portions being made removable so that a variety of different configurations could be tested. The Reynolds number of the tests was 14. 1 x 106 based on the length of the model, and the Mach number was 0. 2. The tests were made with a transition wire attached to the model at 10 % of the length from the nose. A preliminary investigation indicated that the Reynolds number was probably sufficiently large to ensure that the results would give a good guide to the full scale characteristics. The experiments showed that nose camber produces a pitching moment increment in very close agreement with the predictions of inviscid slender body theory. The increments in lift and drag, whilst not zero as predicted by inviscid theory, axe small. Tail camber on the other hand gives rise to much larger lift and drag increments, and the increment in pitching moment is quite different from that predicted by inviscid theory. In the present tests the pitching moment increment due to tail camber amounted to about 10 % of the theoretical value. The scope of the experiment was insufficient to answer the question â€œWhat is the optimum fuselage shape for minimum trim drag?" However, the indications are that an uncambered fuselage at incidence will provide a given pitching moment for less drag than any cambered fuselage. This however neglects the interference effects of the wing and tail unit on the fuselage, and of the fuselage on the wing and tail unit. For reasons of (i) <b>tail</b> <b>clearance</b> on take-off and landing, (ii) cockpit layout and view, and (iii) cabin layout, fuselages with camber may be required. Some indication of the fuselage drag penalties likely to be sustained by these modifications of the fuselage are given by the results of this experiment...|$|E
