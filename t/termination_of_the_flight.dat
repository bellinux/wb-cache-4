50|$|The first Xaero {{test vehicle}} flew 110 test flights before being {{destroyed}} in its 111th flight. During the record-setting flight on Sep 11, 2012, an engine valve stuck open during descent, was sensed by the control system. As designed, the flight termination system was triggered, destroying the vehicle {{before it could}} create a range safety problem. The final test flight was intended to test the vehicle at higher wind loads and altitudes, flying to an altitude of one kilometer while testing the flight controls at higher ascent and descent velocities before returning to a precise landing point. The ascent and initial portion of the descent was nominal, prior to the stuck throttle valve which resulted in <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> prior to the planned precision landing.|$|E
50|$|While N-18 flew {{successfully}} {{from the}} Cape on 21 March, N-21 suffered another second stage failure {{after having been}} delayed several weeks due to another episode of the first stage thrust chambers breaking off prior to launch. This {{was followed by a}} launch from VAFB on 27 April when Missile N-8 flew successfully. N-14 (9 May), flown from LC-16 at the Cape, suffered another early second stage shutdown due to a leaking oxidizer line. Missiles N-19 on 13 May (VAFB) and N-17 on 24 May (CCAS) were successful, but of 18 Titan II launches so far, only 10 had met all of their objectives. On 29 May, Missile N-20 was launched from LC-16 with a new round of pogo-suppressing devices on board. Unfortunately, a fire broke out in the thrust section soon after liftoff, leading to loss of control during ascent. The missile pitched down and the second stage separated from the stack at T+52 seconds, triggering the ISDS, which blew the first stage to pieces. The second stage was manually destroyed by the Range Safety officer shortly thereafter. No useful pogo data was obtained due to the early <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight,</b> and the accident was traced to a stress corrosion of the aluminum fuel valve, which resulted in a propellant leak that caught fire from contacting hot engine parts.|$|E
40|$|A balloon-borne {{experiment}} {{to measure the}} atmospheric electric field was flown from the National Scientific Balloon Facility at Palestine, Texas, on July 10, 1973. The electric field and atmospheric conductivity were measured during ascent and for a 4 -hour float period at 37 -km altitude. <b>Termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> occurred near a thunderstorm line in west Texas. The perturbing influence of the thunderstorms on the electric field was observed at least 100 km from the storm line. The measured electric field is in reasonable agreement with calculations based on simple models of cloud structure and atmospheric conductivity. Large pulses in the measured electric field are interpreted as being the result of intracloud lightning...|$|E

50|$|The Ghauri-II design {{improves}} accuracy by an employing {{mechanisms that}} spin the single booster stage and warhead combination approximately 10 seconds before <b>the</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> powered <b>flight</b> phase at 110 seconds. At this point, the warhead is then {{separated from the}} booster stage to fly on a re-entry trajectory that remains stable to its target, greatly enhancing the missile's accuracy. With <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> GPS targeting <b>the</b> warhead accuracy is further enhanced.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{emphasizes}} the topics concerning honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) mating biology, {{which have not}} been described in the recently published book of Koeniger et al. (2014). At <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> natural mating, <b>the</b> drone becomes paralyzed. However, the muscles in the abdomen continuously contract shrinking the abdomen till mating has ended and the pair have separated. It is not the queen that ends <b>the</b> nuptial <b>flight.</b> <b>The</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nuptial <b>flight</b> {{is determined by the}} drone, which fails to remove <b>the</b> mating sign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous drone from <b>the</b> sting chamber <b>of</b> <b>the</b> queen. The mating sign originates from two or more drones. The queen also does not determine the age at which she starts oviposition.

5000|$|A Houston Chronicle {{article in}} May 2008 stated that {{expected}} subsequent military buildup {{and population growth}} could lead to an expansion of Continental Micronesia flights to and from Guam. However, on June 12, 2008, Continental's announcement of cuts of services, routes and destinations due to high fuel prices [...] included <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> flights to Hong Kong (which has since resumed) and Bali. Also among the cuts is <b>the</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saipan-Manila <b>flights</b> on July 15 which is the last remaining Air Mike <b>flight</b> for Saipan, <b>the</b> airline's original hub 40 years ago. According to an opinion columnist for <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saipan Tribune, the “declared” reason for <b>the</b> cancellation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saipan-Manila route {{was the fact that}} NCLEX tests were now available in Manila, so Filipino nurses no longer had to travel to Saipan to take the test. Before <b>the</b> <b>flight's</b> cancellation, <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> also served medical referrals from <b>the</b> Commonwealth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern Mariana Islands to Manila and non-USA visa alien contract workers who were unable to transit to their final destinations via Guam; the author opined that the alien workers “particularly were Air Micronesia’s captive audience.” With only Continental Connection/Cape Air services left, Continental closed its Saipan city ticket office on the same day.|$|R
40|$|A high-efficiency {{radioisotope}} {{power system}} was being developed for long-duration NASA space science missions. The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) managed a flight contract with Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company to build Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generators (ASRGs), {{with support from}} NASA Glenn Research Center. DOE initiated <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> that contract in late 2013, primarily due to budget constraints. Sunpower, Inc., held two parallel contracts to produce Advanced Stirling Convertors (ASCs), one with Lockheed Martin to produce ASC-F flight units, and one with Glenn for <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> ASC-E 3 engineering unit "pathfinders" that are built to <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> design. In support of those contracts, Glenn provided testing, materials expertise, Government-furnished equipment, inspection capabilities, and related data products to Lockheed Martin and Sunpower. The technical support included material evaluations, component tests, convertor characterization, and technology transfer. Material evaluations and component tests were performed on various ASC components {{in order to assess}} potential life-limiting mechanisms and provide data for reliability models. Convertor level tests were conducted to characterize performance under operating conditions that are representative of various mission conditions. Despite <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ASRG <b>flight</b> development contract, NASA continues to recognize <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> high-efficiency ASC power conversion for Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) and continues investment in the technology, including <b>the</b> continuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ASC-E 3 contract. This paper describes key Government support for the ASRG project and future tests to be used to provide data for ongoing reliability assessments...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> four test <b>flights,</b> between April 1981 and July 1982, {{went without}} incident, and the {{pressure}} suits performed without any problems. With <b>the</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test <b>flight</b> program, all flights from STS-5 to STS-51-L (the Challenger disaster) saw the crew wearing one-piece light blue flight suits, escape harnesses, and helmets similar to the pressure suit helmets, but fitted around {{the head with a}} clamshell-like closure. After Challenger, NASA, in need of an escape system, also required <b>the</b> reintroduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wearing <b>of</b> pressure suits during the launch and landing portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight.</b> <b>The</b> initial eight suits were navy blue, similar in color to <b>the</b> previous <b>flight</b> suits, <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suits were bright orange to contrast against the dark blue ocean water they'd most likely be used in.

For the first [...] "Return to Flight" [...] STS-26, the five-man astronaut crew wore, for the first time, new Launch & Entry Pressure Suits (LES). Resembling the Gemini spacesuit in appearance, but identical in function to the SR-71 partial-pressure suits, the new LES suits featured a one-piece torso-limb suit with a Nomex outer layer (which NASA was able to use on the Shuttle due to the mixed nitrogen/oxygen sea-level atmosphere), closed with a rear-entry zipper, and featuring a full-pressure helmet with a polycarbonate clear faceplate, mechanical seal, and black sunshade, zippered-on gloves (resembling the gloves used by astronaut Alan Shepard on his Mercury space suit), heavy black [...] "paratrooper" [...] style safety boots, and a survival backpack, which is donned prior to entering the Orbiter and contains a parachute, life raft, survival gear, and a 30-minute supply of breathing oxygen.|$|R

40|$|Abstract.

Hence, <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TRS resulting from the termination graph implies <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original JBC program. ...|$|R
40|$|RESUME <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this thesis}} {{is to provide}} a general {{description}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> purpose, functions and principles governing the right to unilaterally terminate a contract under Czech law. <b>The</b> main part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis provides overview <b>of</b> <b>the</b> provisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Civil Code regarding <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> contract, describing <b>the</b> conditions for <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract, limitations on contractual freedom to agree upon grounds for <b>the</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract, prerequisites <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract and the legal consequences to the rights and obligations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contractual parties following successful <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract. The thesis differentiates between the following generally applicable grounds for <b>the</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract: (i) a material breach of contract; (ii) a breach of contract (whether material or immaterial) constituting delay within <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Civil Code, (iii) fulfilment of specific obligation with defects and (iv) anticipatory breach of contract. Each ground for termination is analysed in detail and <b>the</b> overlaps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specific grounds for termination is identified.
