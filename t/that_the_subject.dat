5|$|According to Schultheiss, Herrmann, and Jonas, {{although}} Trousseau {{had earlier}} suggested that surgery was a viable option, {{there is no}} evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> subsequently received treatment; They suggest several possible factors, including legal issues, the subject's refusal, or failed treatment followed by a lack of reporting, for the lack of surgery or evidence of such. Maisonneuve, partially shown in one of the photographs, treated another intersex patient in 1862.|$|E
5|$|During the Enlightenment, {{intellectual}} {{sympathy for}} astrology fell away, {{leaving only a}} popular following supported by cheap almanacs. One English almanac compiler, Richard Saunders, followed {{the spirit of the}} age by printing a derisive Discourse on the Invalidity of Astrology, while in France Pierre Bayle's Dictionnaire of 1697 stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> was puerile. The Anglo-Irish satirist Jonathan Swift ridiculed the Whig political astrologer John Partridge.|$|E

30|$|This {{experiment}} {{also showed}} that when subjects classified Facebook friends, several of their friends caused anxiety such <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> {{did not know how}} to cluster the friend. Most of these people were identified by the SCAN (Xu et al. 2007) algorithm as hubs or outliers. We suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> mark these types of people so that they could be removed from the algorithm-based clustering process and only be used by <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> for manual clustering.|$|R

5|$|Jon Favreau, the writer, {{director}} and star of Chef, wrote the film's script {{in about two}} weeks. He had long {{wanted to make a}} film about food and chefs, and felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> was suited to a small-scale independent film rather than a big-budget production. He cited Jiro Dreams of Sushi, Eat Drink Man Woman and Big Night as inspirations for creating a food-centric film.|$|E
5|$|Mayan {{languages}} are ergative in their alignment. This means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of an intransitive verb is treated similarly {{to the object}} of a transitive verb, but differently from the subject of a transitive verb.|$|E
5|$|Lord Harris {{expressed}} his {{view that the}} painting should show an action shot of a match at the St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury, and suggested that the bowler in the painting should be Kent's Colin Blythe. Kent had only played three matches at Canterbury during the 1906 season; of those it was decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of the painting would be Kent's match against Lancashire County Cricket Club. That match {{was part of the}} Canterbury Cricket Week, and Blythe had taken eight wickets, making it the most appropriate of the three fixtures to depict. Tayler decided that he would show {{the second day of the}} match, at an hour prior to lunchtime.|$|E

5|$|The {{commission}} offered Jovanović {{the opportunity}} {{to make a name for}} himself as a serious history painter, given <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of the work was an event of international significance and the painting was to be displayed in a foreign capital. To ensure Migration of the Serbs was historically accurate, Jovanović studied authentic medieval weapons, costumes and other objects, later incorporating them into the composition. He also studied medieval histories, collected ethnographical evidence and consulted historians. Notably, the Church asked the historian and Orthodox priest Ilarion Ruvarac to consult Jovanović on the historical details of the migration and accompany him on a visit to the monasteries of Fruška Gora, where the young artist examined a number of contemporary sources and objects from the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{remainder}} {{of the first half}} of the episode follows the Fab Five as they escort the subject to various locales to select new furniture and clothes. Often, Ted demonstrates how to select and prepare food for a particular dish <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> will prepare for the special event, and Kyan takes him for spa treatments and a new haircut. Each such segment includes a style tip superimposed on the screen, summarizing the style issues addressed in the segment. Interspersed with this are interview segments in which friends and family members of the subject discuss his style issues.|$|E
5|$|A PIL {{was filed}} in the Karnataka High Court where in the {{petitioner}} requested the court to issue a direction to the Ministry of Home Affairs to consider their representation dated 26 October 2012 and confer the Bharat Ratna upon Mahatma Gandhi. On 27 January 2014, a counsel appearing for the petitioner noted that after multiple representations from the petitioner, they were provided with the information under RTI that the recommendations to confer the award on Gandhi have been received multiple {{times in the past}} and were forwarded to the Prime Minister's Office. A Division bench comprising Chief Justice D.H. Waghela and Justice B.V. Nagarathna dismissed the petition stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> is not amenable to any adjudication process and the nominations and conferment process is stated to be informal and in the discretion of the highest authority in the Government.|$|E

When they presented subjects a {{second type of}} the list and ask if the words had appeared on the previous list, they find <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> did not recognize the list correctly. When {{the words on the}} two lists were semantically related to each other (e.g. sleep/bed), it was more likely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> did not remember the first list correctly and created false memories (Anisfeld & Knapp) ...|$|R

2500|$|If a {{standard}} score {{is applied to}} the ROC curve, the curve will be transformed into a straight line. [...] This z-score is based on a normal distribution with a mean of zero and {{a standard}} deviation of one. In memory strength theory, one must assume <b>that</b> <b>the</b> zROC is not only linear, but has a slope of 1.0. The normal distributions of targets (studied objects <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> need to recall) and lures (non studied objects <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> attempt to recall) is the factor causing the zROC to be linear.|$|R
5|$|After World War II, {{a debate}} about whether a country should {{introduce}} financial planning to develop itself or rely on private entrepreneurs emerged. Nurkse believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of who should promote development does not concern economists. It is an administrative problem. The crucial idea was that {{a large amount of}} well dispersed investment should be made in the economy, so that the market size expands and leads to higher productivity levels, increasing returns to scale and eventually the development of the country in question. However, {{it should be noted that}} most economists who favoured the balanced growth hypothesis believed that only the state has the capacity to take on the kind of heavy investments the theory propagates. Further, the gestation period of such lumpy investments is usually long and private sector entrepreneurs do not normally undertake such high risks.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{attempted}} {{for more than}} a century to understand who is portrayed in this painting. Earlier proposals <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> was John III Sobieski (who would have been eight years old in 1637) or Stephen Bathory (who died in 1586) have been discredited. According to Otakar Odložilík, while the man in the painting is clearly wearing Polish garb, it is neither certain who he is, nor whether he is a Pole. Odložilík's research on this issue suggested that the painting may be that of Andrzej Rej, a Polish noble and diplomat of that era who passed through Amsterdam, the Netherlands, where Rembrandt was working, at the time the painting was created. Nonetheless, without any documents from that era clearly acknowledging that fact, as Odložilík noted, it may never be known for certain who the subject really is.|$|E
5|$|Stephen King criticised the {{reactions}} of some reviewers to the books, including McCauley, for jumping too quickly to surface conclusions of the work. He felt this was inevitable, because of the extreme secrecy before launch which did not allow reviewers time to read and consider the book, but meant that many early reviews lacked depth. Rather than finding the writing style disappointing, he felt it had matured and improved. He acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> matter of the books had become more adult, and that Rowling had clearly been writing with the adult audience firmly in mind {{since the middle of}} the series. He compared the works in this respect to Huckleberry Finn and Alice in Wonderland which achieved success and have become established classics, in part by appealing to the adult audience as well as children.|$|E

5|$|The poem {{is divided}} into two-halves with the first {{describing}} Joan's quest to meet Charles, the Dauphin of France. Eventually, she is capable of gaining the Dauphin's support and begins to lead the French military. The secondary half describes the French defeat of the British army at Orléans. After many victories, the poem ends with Charles crowned King of France. Joan of Arc serves {{as a way for}} Southey to express his views on history and on politics; these include his republican ideals, his claims that political tyranny was a common element in Europe, and his opposition to Christian practices that he thought were superstitious. Later editions of the poem shifted from a promotion of a deistic view of religion to a more traditional view. Critics gave the work mixed reviews, with some emphasising the quality of the images and themes of the poem. However, others believed that the poem lacked merit and some believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> matter was inappropriate to the time. Many critics felt that Southey rushed in composing the work and did not devote enough time to it.|$|E

50|$|In {{sentence}} a, {{the first}} criterion (agreement) {{and the second}} criterion (position occupied) suggest <b>that</b> there is <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> whereas <b>the</b> third criterion (semantic role) suggests rather <b>that</b> problems is <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> In sentence b, in contrast, agreement and semantic role suggest <b>that</b> problems is <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> whereas position occupied suggests <b>that</b> there is <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> In such cases then, one can take the first criterion as the most telling; <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> should agree with the finite verb.|$|R

25|$|Two {{factors are}} {{important}} in producing the Forer effect, according {{to the findings of}} replication studies.
