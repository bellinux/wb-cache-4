While most of the latter focus on work relations, notably patterns of control and surveillance, this paper explores the role of recruitment, selection and training in the shaping call centre labour. The paper uses data from {{a case study of}} a call centre (<b>Telebank)</b> to argue that the increased significance of social competencies within interactive service work gives these procedures greater salience and that they are used by management to address the indeterminacy of labour, in part, outside the labour process. Primary data from management and customer service representatives is used to examine and contrast their respective perceptions of recruitment, selection and training. The paper shows the contested and contradictory tendencies associated with how a particular company identifies and then uses social competencies. Tensions in the labour process between the mobilization of employee attributes and the deliberate moulding and standardization of such competencies is merely part of wider and unresolved tensions concerning the contested nature of emotional labour and the demands of quantity and quality in the management of call centre work...|$|R

While this strategy {{has been applied to}} many different types of work, it is particularly successful in cutting costs in routine interactive service encounters. <b>Telebank,</b> the case study research site, is one of four integrated call centres throughout the UK. Data collection includes taped semi-structured interviews with customer service representatives and managers as well as non-participant observation of recruitment, training and the labour process. This article argues that management has developed a new form of structural control. Theoretically this draws heavily on Edwards's concept of technical control, but not only is this shown to be extended and modified, it is also combined with bureaucratic control, which influences the social structure of the workplace. Contrary to Edwards such systems are not distinct; rather they are blended together in the process of institutionalizing control. Part of the rationale for this is to camouflage control, to contain conflict by making control a product of the system rather than involving direct confrontation between management and workers. Despite such attempts the struggle for transforming labour power into profitable labour remains, and the article ends by exploring confrontation between workers and managers and worker agency more generally...|$|R

Best response functions and Nash equilibria may be better described by non-linearity than by linearity.

In the linear model, the dynamics and properties of a Nash equilibrium may be a priori, straight forward and trivial. However, nonlinearity contains the diverse possibility of dynamics, describing the game more realisti-cally and carrying rich economic implications. Using nonlinear functions, our study investigates the game between banks with ATMs, <b>telebanking</b> and internet banking services, and discusses the existence of stable Nash equilibria and the possibility of collu-sion between players.

A "guard" functionality on the user login host's side relays the application service suppliers' password requests to a password server which satisfies these requests with strong "machine" passwords. To the user, this system appears to be password-less. Application providers do not have to give up their current password security.

40|$|Abstract. Biometric {{authentication}} using mobile devices {{is becoming}} a convenient and important means to secure access to remote services such as <b>telebanking</b> and elec-tronic transactions. Such an application poses a very challenging pattern recognition problem: the training samples are often sparse and they cannot represent the biomet-rics of a person. The query features are easily affected by the acquisition environment, the user’s accessories, occlusions and aging. Semi-supervised learning – learning from the query/test data – can be a means to tap the vast unlabeled training data. While {{there is evidence that}} semi-supervised learning can work in text categorization and biomet-rics, its application on mobile devices remains a great challenge. As a preliminary, yet, indispensable study towards the goal of semi-supervised learning, we analyze the fol-lowing sub-problems: model adaptation, update criteria, inference with several models and user-specific time-dependent performance assessment, and explore possible solu-tions and research directions. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} how {{organizational}} structuring can facilitate or hinder organizations’ capacity to learn {{when a new}} technology is implemented. We are concerned with a particular philosophy of structuring- minimal structure. We argue that learning ultimately depends on the way communities build their sense of identity while enacting existing structure. Organizational context can facilitate or hinder the processes by which {{a sense of community}} is created. Formative context plays a very important part in these processes. Underlying this sense of community, social identity structures meanings, coordination, learning and structures. Identity is critical to the enactment of minimal structures. An in-depth multiple case study design of two <b>telebanking</b> systems implemented and used are described, and analyzed. Findings indicate that there are ways by which the structuring can block improvisational activity, this in turn hinders both the social identity and the social learning processes. Moreover, minimal structuring design philosophy gives room to improvising and to making sense of the incoming events and the development of ad hoc solutions, within th...|$|E
40|$|Distributed {{systems are}} the basis of {{widespread}} computing facilities enabling many of our daily life activities. <b>Telebanking,</b> electronic commerce, online booking-reservation, and telecommunication are examples of common services that rely on distributed systems {{in order to achieve}} their desirable ubiquity. The success of these services increasingly depends on fault-tolerant systems to preserve their availability and reliability despite partial failures. Fault tolerance can be achieved by introducing redundancy into the system. This leads to the need of coordinating replicated components which {{has been one of the}} biggest trends in software technologies. This thesis is about process coordination in fault-tolerant distributed systems. In particular, it focuses on the problem of reaching agreement among processes considering the well-known Consensus problem. Consensus is regarded as an abstract problem whose solutions embody the complexity inherent to most agreement problems. This thesis studies the solvability of consensus in asynchronous network systems augmented with a failure detector oracle. Both, the processes and the network, are subject to benign failures. The thesis' overall contribution is a consensus algorithm that tolerates process crash and network omission failures, and exploits the recovery of crashed process. A contribution of this thesis is the definition of a novel type of weakly reliable communication channels, called Stubborn. The semantics of Stubborn channels reflect the reliability on communication required to solve consensus. Furthermore, it is shown that an algorithm designed with Stubborn in-stead of reliable channels can offer the same number of messages exchanged in favorable runs and avoid communication steps in disadvantageous runs. Stubborn channels can be easily implemented on top of existing network layers and make reasonable requirements on message buffering space. To handle the crash and recovery of processes it is proposed a model which encompasses the different patterns of crashes and recoveries that can be exhibited by the processes. The approach considers two different problems concerning crash and recovery: (1) processes that can be disruptive because they are always crashing and recovering, and (2) amnesia failures caused by crashes. The solution for the first problem consists in the use of a new class of failure detectors distinguished by its recurrent strong completeness property. To cope with the crash and recovery of any process involved, process amnesia cannot be arbitrary and thus processes are equipped with a stable storage device. The proposed algorithm judiciously specifies accesses to stable storage, and by exploiting the recovery of processes it can solve consensus in scenarios where other algorithms would otherwise block...|$|E
40|$|Distributed {{computing}} is {{reshaping the}} way people think about and do daily life activities. On-line ticket reservation, electronic commerce, and <b>telebanking</b> are examples of services that would be hardly imaginable without distributed computing. Nevertheless, widespread use of computers has some implications. As we become more depend on computers, computer malfunction increases in importance. Until recently, discussions about fault tolerant computer systems were restricted to very specific contexts, but this scenario starts to change, though. This thesis is about the design of fault tolerant computer systems. More specifically, this thesis focuses on how to develop database systems that behave correctly even {{in the event of}} failures. In order to achieve this objective, this work exploits the notions of data replication and group communication. Data replication is an intuitive way of dealing with failures: if one copy of the data is not available, access another one. However, guaranteeing the consistency of replicated data is not an easy task. Group communication is a high level abstraction that defines patterns on the communication of computer sites. The present work advocates the use of group communication in order to enforce data consistency. This thesis makes four major contributions. In the database domain, it introduces the Database State Machine and the Reordering technique. The Database State Machine is an approach to executing transactions in a cluster of database servers that communicate by message passing, and {{do not have access to}} shared memory nor to a common clock. In the Database State Machine, read-only transactions are processed locally on a database site, and update transactions are first executed locally on a database site, and them broadcast to the other database sites for certification and possibly commit. The certification test, necessary to commit update transactions, may result in aborts. In order to increase the number of transactions that successfully pass the certification test, we introduce the Reordering technique, which reorders transactions before they are committed. In the distributed system domain, the Generic Broadcast problem and the Optimistic Atomic Broadcast algorithm are proposed. Generic Broadcast is a group communication primitive that allows applications to define any order requirement they need. Reliable Broadcast, which does not guarantee any order on the delivery of messages, and Atomic Broadcast, which guarantees total order on the delivery of all messages, are special cases of Generic Broadcast. Using Generic Broadcast, we define a group communication primitive that guarantees the exact order needs of the Database State Machine. We also present an algorithm that solves Generic Broadcast. Optimistic Atomic Broadcast algorithms exploit system properties in order to implement total order delivery fast. These algorithms are based on system properties that do not always hold. However, it they hold for a certain period, ensuring total order delivery of messages is done faster than with traditional Atomic Broadcast algorithms. This thesis discusses optimism in the implementation of Atomic Broadcast primitives, and presents in detail the Optimistic Atomic Broadcast algorithm. The optimistic broadcast approach presented in this thesis is based on the spontaneous total order message reception property, which holds with high probability in local area networks under normal execution conditions (e. g., moderate load) ...|$|E
