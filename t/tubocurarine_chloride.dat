40|$|Potassium {{chloride}} and cholinergic {{drugs were}} rested on isolated arms of Amphipholis squamata; potassium chloride triggered a monophasic light emission; acetylcholine (10 (- 3) M) induced a luminescent response characterized by multiple flashes. ACh luminescence was {{increased in the}} presence of the cholinesterase inhibitor, eserine. Nicotinic antagonists, <b>tubocurarine</b> and hexamethonium <b>chloride,</b> had no inhibitory effect on the luminescence; muscarinic antagonists, atropine and benzotropine mesylate inhibited Amphipholis luminescence. These results suggest that the luminescence in A. squamata is mediated through a muscarinic cholinergic system. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Inc...|$|R
40|$|T h: {{antagonism}} between <b>tubocurarine</b> and alcuronium <b>chloride</b> on the {{one hand}} and neostigmine, physostigmine, edrophonium and ambenonium on the other have been investigated. A quantitative measure of antagonism was obtained on the rat diaphragm preparation and it was found that in general the antagonists were more effective against alcuronium <b>chloride</b> than against <b>tubocurarine.</b> The antagonist drugs potentiated the action of acetylcholine on frog rectus muscle. The muscarinic action of ambenonium was less apparent than that of the other drugs but it caused severe reduction in amplitude of cardiac contraction and arrest in 50 per cent of the preparations. It is concluded that ambenonium is unlikely to prove a satisfactory drug for further investigation in man. Neostigmine is almost universally used, in the United Kingdom at least, as an antagonist to tubocurarine. It serves the purpose adequately and cases of neostigmine-resistant curarization are very rare, much rarer indeed than was suggested by the correspondence which followed the origina...|$|R
5000|$|Without intervention, [...] {{acetylcholine}} (Ach) in {{the peripheral}} nervous system activates skeletal muscles. Acetylcholine is produced {{in the body of}} the neuron by choline acetyltransferase and transported down the axon to the synaptic gap. <b>Tubocurarine</b> <b>chloride</b> acts as an antagonist for the [...] nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchr), meaning it blocks the receptor site from Ach. This may be due to the quaternary amino structural motif found on both molecules.|$|E
40|$|In {{combined}} {{cultures of}} chick muscle cells and ciliary ganglia, {{the effect of}} indirect, long-term stimulation {{on the number of}} neuromuscular contacts on individual muscle cells was studied. Seven days of phasic stimulation resulted in a marked {{reduction in the number of}} neuromuscular contacts, the majority of the muscle cells becoming innervated by only one neuron. Neuromuscular blockade by D-tubocurarine prevented this loss of innervation. Chemicals/CAS: <b>tubocurarine</b> <b>chloride,</b> 57 - 94 - 3, 57 - 95 - 4, 8006 - 51 -...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of various neural explants on the morphology and {{the survival of}} chick muscle fibers was studied. A method was developed to evaluate {{the condition of the}} muscle fibers using the following four morphological parameters: cross striation, thickness, number of fibers and absence of vacuoles. Chick as well as mouse spinal cord explants appeared to have a distinct favorable influence on the muscle fibers. Chick ciliary ganglia and mouse cortex explants had less effect and chick sympathetic ganglia and mouse dorsal root ganglia had no effect. Innervation by spinal cord neurons did not lead to a change in resting membrane potential of the muscle fibers. The amount of cross striation in muscle fibers in the vicinity of mouse spinal cord explants was positively correlated with the frequency of spontaneous end-plate potentials in the muscle fibers. d-Tubocurarine did not interfere with the trophic support of muscle cells by nerve cells, although it reversibly blocked neuromuscular transmission throughout the experiment. This demonstrates that neither the acetylcholine receptor nor the activity induced in the muscle fiber mediate the trophic action. The data suggest that a humoral trophic factor, released at the neuromuscular junction or at a region of close cell-cell contact, is needed for normal development and maintenance of muscle fiber morphology.

Our previous studies also showed that nicotine-treated dendritic cells have potential antitumor effects. Hence, the precise effects of nicotine on the biological characterizations of cells are controversial. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the roles of 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), Erk 1 / 2 -p 38 -JNK and PI 3 K-Akt pathway in nicotine-mediated proliferation and anti-apoptosis effects. The results firstly showed that nicotine treatment clearly augmented cell viability and upregulated PCNA expression in both Raw 264. 7 and El 4 cells. Meanwhile, nicotine afforded protection against cisplatin-induced toxicity through inhibiting caspase- 3 activation and upregulating anti-apoptotic protein expression. Further exploration demonstrated that nicotine efficiently abolished cisplatin-promoted mitochondria translocation of Bax and the release of cytochrome c. The pretreatment of -bungarotoxin and <b>tubocurarine</b> <b>chloride</b> significantly attenuated nicotine-augmented cell viability, abolished caspase- 3 activation and 7 nAChR upregulation. Both Erk-JNK-p 38 and PI 3 K-Akt signaling pathways could be activated by nicotine treatment in Raw 264. 7 and El 4 cells. Notably, when Erk-JNK and PI 3 K-Akt activities were inhibited, nicotine-augmented cell proliferation and anti-apoptotic effects were abolished accordingly. The results presented here indicate that nicotine could achieve 7 nAChR-mediated proliferation and anti-apoptotic effects by activating Erk-JNK and PI 3 K-Akt pathways respectively, providing potential therapeutic molecules to deal with smoking-associated human diseases...|$|E
40|$|We used intraneural {{recordings}} of sympathetic nerve activity in conscious humans {{to determine if}} central command increases sympathetic discharge to resting skeletal muscle during static exercise. In nine healthy subjects, we measured arterial pressure, heart rate, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity with microelectrodes in the peroneal nerve of the resting leg during 1) static handgrip at 15 % and 30 % maximal voluntary contraction and 2) attempted handgrip during partial neuromuscuiar blockade produced by systemic administration of <b>tubocurarine</b> <b>chloride</b> (0. 075 mg/kg i. v.). During curare, subjects reported that they used near-maximal motor effort to attempt a sustained handgrip contraction, but they generated almost no force. Without sustained contraction, the intent to exercise alone, that is, central command, caused statistically significant (/> over control) and pressor response (+ 25 ± 3 mm Hg) during an actual static handgrip at 30 % maximal voluntary contraction. In contrast, heart rate increased as much during the attempted contraction (+ 18 ± 2 beats/min) as during the actuaj contraction at 30 % maximal voluntary contraction (+ 16 ± 4 beats/min). In 11 additional subjects, the heart rate responses during curare were greatly attenuated (/>< 0. 05) by atropine but were not significantly affected by propranolol. From these observations, we conclude that during static handgrip in humans central command {{plays a major role}} in the regulation of parasympathetic outflow to the sinus node and a minor role in the activation of sympathetic outflow to nonexercising skeletal muscle. The new concept suggested by these data is that central command governs vagally mediated increases in heart rate at all levels of static exercise but contributes to activation of skeletal muscle sympathetic outflow only at near-maximal levels of static handgrip. {Circulatio...|$|E
40|$|Previous results {{had shown}} that bis-pyridinium oximes, {{particularly}} HI- 6 are quite effective therapeutically in soman-poisoned rats and mice in vivo and in the rat diaphragm preparation in vitro. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the efficacy of bis-pyridinium oximes on soman-inhibited neuromuscular transmission in muscle preparations from several species including man. The muscles tested were preparations of rat diaphragm and intercostal muscle, guinea-pig diaphragm, dog external intercostal muscle and human external intercostal muscle. These muscles were stimulated indirectly with field stimulation. With a few exceptions the preparations were exposed to soman for 2. 5 or 15 min. In some cases different exposure times were employed or the organophosphate sarin was administered instead of its analogue soman. After the degree of inhibition of neuromuscular transmission had been established, oximes were added to the bath fluid. After washout 15 min later, recovery of neuromuscular transmission was tested. Subsequently, a second dose of soman was administered to investigate whether the recovery observed had been caused by cholinesterase reactivation. The results of these experiments indicate that the oximes tested, mostly HI- 6, were quite effective as soman antidotes in muscle preparations of rats, guinea-pigs and dogs. In the human preparation while these oximes were quite effective after sarin intoxication they were essentially without effect against soman.
