Bartók assigned opus numbers to his works three times, {{the last of}} these series ending with the Sonata for Violin and Piano No. 1, Op. 21 in 1921. He ended this practice {{because of the difficulty}} of distinguishing between original works and ethnographic arrangements, and between major and minor works. Since his death, three attempts—two full and one partial—have been made at cataloguing. The first, and still most widely used, is András Szőllősy's chronological Sz. numbers, from 1 to 121. Denijs Dille subsequently reorganised the juvenilia (Sz. 1–25) thematically, as DD numbers 1 to 77.

500|$|The First Cello Concerto, in A minor (1872) is {{a serious}} {{although}} animated work, in a single continuous movement with an unusually turbulent first section. It {{is among the most}} popular concertos in the cello repertory, much favoured by Pablo Casals and later players. The Second, in D minor (1902), like the Fourth Piano Concerto, consists of two movements each subdivided into two distinct sections. It is more purely virtuosic than its predecessor: Saëns-Saëns commented to Fauré that it would never be as popular as the First because it was too difficult. There are three violin concertos; the first to be composed dates from 1858 but was not published until 1879, as the composer's Second, in C major. The First, in A, was also completed in 1858. It is a short work, its single 314-bar movement lasting {{less than a quarter of}} an hour. The Second, in conventional three-movement concerto form, is twice as long as the First, and is the least popular of the three: the <b>thematic</b> <b>catalogue</b> of the composer's works lists only three performances in his lifetime. The Third, in B minor, written for Pablo de Sarasate, is technically challenging for the soloist, although the virtuoso passages are balanced by intervals of pastoral serenity. It is by some margin the most popular of the three violin concertos, but Saint-Saëns's best-known concertante work for violin and orchestra is probably the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso, in A minor, Op. 28, a single-movement piece, also written for Sarasate, dating from 1863. It changes from a wistful opening to a swaggering main theme, described as faintly sinister by the critic Gerald Larner, who goes on, [...] "After a multi-stopped cadenza... the solo violin makes a breathless sprint through the coda to the happy ending in A major".|$|E

5000|$|It is hard {{to discern}} any {{substantive}} formal characteristic that could distinguish cassations from other serenade-like genres, such as the divertimento, notturno, or Finalmusik.

Breitkopf's <b>thematic</b> <b>catalogues</b> of the time tended to apply titles such as [...] "cassation" [...] and [...] "divertimento" [...] rather interchangeably, as did the composers themselves. This terminological overlap makes it difficult to distinguish formal characteristics of the cassation as a musical genre.

40|$|Digital {{technologies}} {{can help}} scholars {{to navigate the}} vast quantities of musical data and source materials now available to them, but an imaginative leap is {{needed in order to}} conceptualize the kinds of musicological research questions we might ask of electronic corpora. In particular, our data-rich digital world offers enormous potential for the exploration of musical transmission and relatedness. In this article, we explore the 16 th- and 17 th-century instrumental battaglia (battle piece), a genre with a very distinctive collective identity arising from the use of numerous shared ingredients (including melodic, motivic, textural, harmonic and rhythmic features). However, a battaglia is not defined by the presence of a core set of essential features, and exact concordance between these pieces is often remarkably low. This kind of musical ‘family resemblance’ (formulated after Wittgenstein) poses a serious challenge to both traditional musicological apparatus (for example, finding aids such as <b>thematic</b> <b>catalogues)</b> and Music Information Retrieval (which has often privileged melodic similarity {{at the expense of other}} kinds of musical relatedness). This case study provides a stimulus for rethinking the complex nature of musical similarity.

Today’s students have grown up searching the internet.

As a music librarian and musicologist, introducing students to appropriate resources is a key component of my teaching in both my own courses and library instruction sessions. Getting students engaged in, and hopefully excited about, the research process must come first. Otherwise, teaching resources becomes a show-and-tell exercise followed by a paint-by-the-numbers assignment. Using experiential learning activities and exercises show students what resources are out there, how to find useful resources, and how to assess what they find. Students are taught how to explore their intellectual curiosity, engage in research, and ask questions that require scholarly resources to answer them effectively.

2500|$|Telemann {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prolific}} major composers of all time: his all-encompassing oeuvre comprises more than 3,000 compositions, half of which have been lost, and most of which have not been performed since the 18th century. From 1708 to 1750, Telemann composed 1,043 sacred cantatas and 600 overture-suites, and types of concertos for combinations of instruments that no other composer of the time composed. The first accurate estimate of the number of his works was provided by musicologists only during the 1980s and 1990s, when extensive <b>thematic</b> <b>catalogues</b> were published. During his lifetime and the latter half of the 18th century, Telemann was very highly regarded by colleagues and critics alike. Numerous theorists (Marpurg, Mattheson, Quantz, and Scheibe, among others) cited his works as models, and major composers such as J.S. Bach and Handel bought and studied his published works. He was immensely popular not only in Germany but also in the rest of Europe: orders for editions of Telemann's music came from France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Scandinavian countries, Switzerland, and Spain. It was only in the early 19th century that his popularity came to a sudden halt. Most lexicographers started dismissing him as a [...] "polygraph" [...] who composed too many works, a Vielschreiber for whom quantity came before quality. Such views were influenced by an account of Telemann's music by Christoph Daniel Ebeling, a late-18th-century critic who in fact praised Telemann's music and made only passing critical remarks of his productivity. After the Bach revival, Telemann's works were judged as inferior to Bach's and lacking in deep religious feeling. For example, by 1911, the Encyclopædia Britannica lacked an article about Telemann, and in one of its few mentions of him referred to [...] "the vastly inferior work of lesser composers such as Telemann" [...] in comparison to Handel and Bach.|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of {{cooperation}} between the Dutch Government and the Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS) a Crop Protection Training Project (DFPV) was established in Niger. Initially known as the Department of Training in Crop Protection, the DFPV {{is now one of}} several projects implemented by CILSS which are designed to reinforce national crop protection services and develop their capacity for the integrated control of food crop pests. The DFPV was created in 1981 {{to meet the needs of}} the nine Member States of CILSS to train individuals in crop protection, it has now developed into a leading training institute within the system and is an integral part of ClLSS's 'Training Major Programme' based at the Agrhymet Regional Centre in the Netherlands. The DFPV's objectives are to contribute to food self-sufficiency in the CILSS Member States through the training of crop protection workers who are directly operational in the field and to reinforce the capacity of national crop protection services to deal with pest problems through the training of technicians. To meet these objectives, the DFPV runs courses to train high level crop protection technicians and trainers from agricultural schools in the CILSS Member States. Other courses include in-country training (based on the particular needs of specific countries); training for highly qualified individuals or groups; training workshops; and refresher courses. The DFPV also carries out research designed to support the training programmes by developing further skills and knowledge in subject areas related to crop protection. The research also produces educational and instructional training materials, and generates practical and simple results that farmers can use. Emphasis is put on multidisciplinary research in order to promote an integrated approach to crop protection at farm level. The project collaborates with national services and international institutions such as the National Agricultural Research Institute, the Crop Protection Directorate of Niger, the University of Niamey (Niger), ICRISAT, IITA, PRIFAS and ORSTOM. The information component of DFPV has now been integrated with the documentation centre of Agrhymet. It disseminates scientific and technical information on crop protection, and carries out bibliographic searches free-of-charge. As well as a computerized database of articles, the information centre can also provide <b>thematic</b> <b>catalogues</b> and a newsletter to help former trainees maintain their contact with the project. Although the Crop Protection Training Project was initially open only to those from CILSS Member States, the courses are now offered to nationals of other countries.
