25|$|Both schools flourished but in {{the early}} part of the last century Cardinal Vaughan asked the Oratory Fathers to inaugurate the first Central Schools for Catholic children. This they did in 1912, {{developing}} the two schools which ceased to be fee paying, into Central Schools on a site in Stewart's Grove, Chelsea. During both World Wars, sixty six Oratorians lost their lives fighting for their country. In 1959 the two central schools were amalgamated and in 1962 it was decided that the Daughters of the Cross were to be withdrawn after almost a century of devoted work. In 1963 the school was classified as a four-form entry grammar school admitting only boys since there were already many more selective places for girls than boys in the schools in the diocese. However <b>those</b> <b>girls</b> currently at the school were, on the insistence of the newly appointed headmaster (who had applied for and been appointed head of a mixed school), allowed to remain at the school to complete their education. With the later introduction of girls into the sixth form which remains in place up to the present day, there was effectively no period since 1959 when girls at some point were not attending the school.|$|E

500|$|Speaking of the song's lyrical background, Cruz told Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul: [...] "Its about {{breaking}} a girl's heart, {{but in a}} way that's kinda not on purpose. It's more that I'm just a single guy, trying to be single and trying to remain single. And sometimes, when you are in that place, you get girls who wanna be a part of what you're about – but, because you're not really ready for a relationship, <b>those</b> <b>girls</b> can end up being heartbroken. So what I'm basically saying is 'I might just break your heart. But I'm only gonna break your heart if you come through this way right now'." [...] Cruz also has called his song [...] "catchy" [...] with a [...] "good melody" [...] and [...] "fun topic", stating that [...] "both girls and guys can get into this character". In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Cruz elaborated and said the song was partially based on a personal situation, and rather an [...] "exaggeration of an experience".|$|E

They have all rejected me and looked down on me as an inferior man." [...] When Rodger was unable {{to gain access to}} the sorority house after [...] "vigorous knocking" [...] on the sorority house door, he improvised, opening fire on nearby women students.|$|E

I just picture <b>those</b> <b>girls...</b> how alone they were when they died." [...] When questioned by reporters as to whether the audio tape should have been introduced into evidence, given the obvious psychological and emotional trauma caused to many in the courtroom through the contents being broadcast, Kay simply stated: [...] "You're darn right it [...] should have been.

2500|$|Sexual {{relationships}} outside marriage are {{not uncommon}} among teenage {{boys and girls in}} India. By far, the best predictor of whether or not a girl would be having sex is if her friends were engaging in the same activities. For <b>those</b> <b>girls</b> whose friends were having a physical relationship with a boy, 84.4% were engaging in the same behavior. Only 24.8% of girls whose friends were not having a physical relationship had one themselves. In urban areas, 25.2% of girls have had intercourse and in rural areas 20.9% have. [...] Better indicators of whether or not girls were having sex were their employment and school status. [...] Girls who were not attending school were 14.2% (17.4% v. 31.6%) more likely and girls who were employed were 14.4%(36.0% v. 21.6%) more likely to be having sex.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{her style}} of humor, which often relied on making jokes {{about her own}} life and satirizing the lives of celebrities and public figures, was {{sometimes}} criticized as insensitive. Her jokes about Elizabeth Taylor and Adele's weight, for instance, were often commented on, although Rivers would never apologize for her humor. Rivers, who was Jewish, was also criticized for making jokes about the Holocaust and later explained, [...] "This is the way I remind people about the Holocaust. I do it through humor", adding, [...] "my husband lost his entire family in the Holocaust." [...] Her joke about {{the victims of the}} Ariel Castro kidnappings similarly came under criticism, but she again refused to apologize, stating, [...] "I know what <b>those</b> <b>girls</b> went through.

[...] Furthermore, the lawsuit [...] "claims the minister told the child's parents that Ballenger 'just loved children,' and, 'You don't have a case.'" [...] The church settled the lawsuit out of court and the terms were not disclosed. At the criminal trial, three young women testified deacon A.V. Ballenger [...] "had fondled them years ago." [...] One of <b>those</b> <b>girls</b> testified that she was molested on the Hammond church bus. A former security officer at the church testified he saw Ballenger fondle a young girl in 1978 or 1979 in a Sunday school room after being called to the room by a female teacher. In 1993, Ballenger was sentenced to five years in prison.|$|E

Both men insisted multiple times that the crash had to be reported to the authorities. According to Markham's testimony, Kennedy was sobbing and on the verge of becoming crazed. Kennedy went on to testify, [...] " [...] had full intention of reporting it.
