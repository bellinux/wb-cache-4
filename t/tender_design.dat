Members of the third batch (70045–70054) were equipped with another <b>tender</b> <b>design,</b> the BR1D, which had 9 tons of coal and 4,750 gallons of water, {{due to the fact}} that they were intended for use on longer runs in the north of the railway network.

500|$|Bulleid {{designed}} a new [...] tender which could carry 5 tons (5.1 t) of coal on a six-wheel chassis. [...] It featured BFB wheels and streamlined panels, or [...] "raves", {{that gave the}} top of the tender a similar cross-sectional outline to the carriages hauled by the locomotive. [...] The water tank was of welded sheet construction to save weight, and the tender was fitted with vacuum braking equipment of a clasp-type similar to that used on the locomotive. [...] Three train-brake vacuum reservoirs of cylindrical construction were grouped on the tank top, behind the coal space. [...] Unusually for a British locomotive, two extra water filler caps were incorporated into the tender front, for access from the footplate. [...] The original <b>tender</b> <b>design</b> proved to be inadequately braced and subject to serious leakage if even slightly damaged, or when water surges caused the welded joints to split. [...] The problem was not solved until 1944 when additional baffling was fitted.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} 8th Class locomotive and <b>tender</b> was <b>designed</b> in 1901 by H.M. Beatty, Chief Locomotive Superintendent of the Cape Government Railways (CGR), at its Salt River {{works in}} Cape Town. The Type XF first entered service in 1902, as tender to the forty 8th Class locomotives which were {{built for the}} Imperial Military Railways (IMR) by Neilson, Reid and Sharp, Stewart. The <b>tender's</b> <b>design</b> could therefore possibly be credited to Lieutenant Colonel E.P.C. Girouard KCMG DSO RE, Director of Railways of the IMR. When the Central South African Railways (CSAR) was established from the IMR {{at the end of}} the Second Boer War, these locomotives were designated Class 8-L1.|$|R

50|$|The {{standard}} AB <b>tender</b> <b>design</b> {{was adapted}} for the three-cylinder G class locomotive 4-6-2 tender locomotive rebuilds of 1937. These tenders {{had a more}} substantial tender underframe, and was also unique in that the body was of welded construction rather than the traditional riveted style. As such, they {{became known as the}} 'G' style tender. When the six locomotives were withdrawn in 1956, their tenders were fitted to AB class locomotives.|$|E
50|$|The tank {{locomotives}} {{were themselves}} rare. Two separate classes {{were built in}} the UK, by two different railway companies. Both of these had their origins with an 0-8-0 <b>tender</b> <b>design.</b> Both classes were designed as powerful, but slow-speed, locomotives for heavy shunting. They did not require high speed or long range, so had no need for a leading truck or the greater coal capacity of a tender. Other than this though, they were quite distinct.|$|E

50|$|For the 2501 class engines, {{little or}} no {{consideration}} was given to British practice, so they were distinctly American in appearance, and their tenders were typical of American practice, featuring two bogies of two axles each, rather than the rigid, three axle <b>tender</b> <b>design</b> more commonly used in Britain. However, when the 2511's were acquired, more consideration was given, as they had tenders of the latter design and their appearance, while still American, had much cleaner lines.|$|E
