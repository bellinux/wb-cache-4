5|$|In 2011, the Noble Organisation put {{the pier}} for sale, with an {{expected}} price of £30 million. It was rumoured {{that the council}} wanted to buy the pier, but this was quickly ruled out. It was <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> market the following year, {{due to lack of}} interest in suitable buyers. In 2016, it was sold to the Eclectic Bar Group, headed by former PizzaExpress owner Luke Johnson, who renamed the pier back to Brighton Palace Pier in July.|$|E

5|$|Machine Head {{was formed}} when Flynn felt musically {{unfulfilled}} with his bands Forbidden and Vio-lence and requested {{to start a}} side project. When his request was denied, he left the band and formed Machine Head in 1991 with Duce, Logan Mader and Tony Constanza. The band's first album, Burn My Eyes, was a big success in Europe where it garnered attention on MTV's Headbangers Ball. In America (with HBB <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> air during the grunge movement) Machine Head would not have success until later albums.|$|E

5|$|On 6 March, during United's 3–1 loss against Liverpool at Anfield, Nani {{was injured}} {{following}} a challenge from Jamie Carragher just before half-time. Nani shed tears after {{the challenge and}} was subsequently <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> pitch in a stretcher. Following post-match comments to the press from Manchester United, it was believed Nani had suffered a broken leg. However, {{this was not the}} case as he started training the following week. It was thought Nani would miss up to three weeks as a result of this tackle and would return in April, but he recovered in time to play 61 minutes of a 2–1 victory over Marseille on 15 March.|$|E
5|$|The Cubs {{began playing}} under the College of Coaches in 1961, {{a system in}} which {{decisions}} were made by a group of 12 coaches rather than by one manager. By the 1962 season, Banks hoped to return to shortstop but the College of Coaches had determined that he would remain at first base indefinitely. In May 1962, Banks was hit in the head by a fastball from former Cubs pitcher Moe Drabowsky and was <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> field unconscious. He sustained a concussion, spent two nights in a hospital, sat out a Monday game, and hit three home runs and a double on Tuesday.|$|E
5|$|The current menu {{still has}} {{elements}} {{from the earlier}} days of the restaurant, such as lobster thermidor and grouse. Chef Gueller produces modern French cuisine, with classical elements. Dishes on the restaurant's menu include a terrine of foie gras served with a salad of smoked eel, alongside apple served both as a jelly and as a purée. Foie gras was temporarily <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> menu in 2008 following threats of protests from animal rights activists. The dish was later restored to the menu, and foie gras has also since been served with a duck terrine and pistachios.|$|E

On Sunday 5 July, amidst considerable media interest, the ship was towed up the River Avon to Bristol. Perhaps the most memorable moment for the crowds that lined the final few miles was her passage under the Clifton Suspension Bridge, another Brunel design. She waited for {{two weeks in the}} Cumberland Basin for a tide high enough to get her back through the locks to the Floating Harbour and her birthplace, the dry dock in the Great Western Dockyard (now a grade II* listed building, disused since bomb damage in the Second World War).|$|E
5|$|Three {{losses in}} four games, capped by a 5–0 defeat against the Boston Bruins on March 27 left the Flames six points {{out of the}} eighth and final playoff spot with seven games remaining. The team also lost second-line centre Daymond Langkow after he was <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ice on a {{stretcher}} in Minnesota after being struck {{in the back of}} the neck by a slapshot. However, a 5–3 road victory against the Eastern Conference leading Washington Capitals and a 2–1 home win against the Phoenix Coyotes, coupled with the Colorado Avalanche losing six of their final seven games to end the month of March, left the Flames two points behind the Avalanche heading into April.|$|E
