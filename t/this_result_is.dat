5|$|Algebraic {{operations}} {{can be done}} readily on {{the power}} series representation; for instance, Euler's formula follows from Taylor series expansions for trigonometric and exponential functions. <b>This</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> of fundamental importance in such fields as harmonic analysis.|$|E
5|$|During formal occasions, {{four people}} are {{required}} to properly fold the flag, where each person holds one of the sides.

5|$|The general {{problem of}} solving Sudoku puzzles on n2×n2 grids of n×n blocks {{is known to}} be NP-complete. For n=3 (classical Sudoku), however, <b>this</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> of little relevance: {{algorithms}} such as Dancing Links can solve puzzles in fractions of a second.|$|E
5|$|Since w divides both {{terms on}} the {{right-hand}} side, it must also divide the left-hand side, v. <b>This</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> known as Euclid's lemma. Specifically, if a prime number divides L, then it must divide at least one factor of L. Conversely, if a number w is coprime to each {{of a series of}} numbers a1, a2, …, a'n, then w is also coprime to their product, a1×a2×…×a'n.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{define the}} {{metallicity}} {{of a star}} as the abundance of chemical elements that have a higher atomic number than helium. This is measured by a spectroscopic analysis of the atmosphere, followed by a comparison with the results expected from computed stellar models. In the case of IK Pegasus A, the estimated metal abundance is  = +0.07 ± 0.20. This notation gives the logarithm of the ratio of metal elements (M) to hydrogen (H), minus the logarithm of the Sun's metal ratio. (Thus if the star matches the metal abundance of the Sun, this value will be zero.) A logarithmic value of 0.07 is equivalent to an actual metallicity ratio of 1.17, so the star is about 17% richer in metallic elements than the Sun. However {{the margin of error}} for <b>this</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> relatively large.|$|E
