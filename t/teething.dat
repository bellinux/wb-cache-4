5|$|Despite the <b>teething</b> {{problems}} with the MiG-3, in 1941 one of the aircraft's designers—Mikhail Gurevich—was awarded the State Stalin Prize for his contribution to Soviet aviation.|$|E
5|$|Stewie is {{in terrible}} pain from <b>teething</b> and cannot find comfort anywhere. When his mother Lois {{tells him that}} his pain will {{ultimately}} pass, it gives him the idea to build a machine that will move time forward {{to the point where}} his <b>teething</b> will have already stopped. Meanwhile, Lois tells Peter to drive their other son Chris to his soccer match, then come right back to look after Stewie. However, Peter's friend Quagmire is there, and has brought beer, so Peter decides to ignore Lois and stay at the game. While there, another member of the crowd insults Chris. Enraged, Peter punches this person in the face, only to discover that it is a pregnant woman who looks and sounds like a man.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several minor {{incidents}} with a few Eurostar services. In October 1994 there were <b>teething</b> problems relating {{to the start of}} operations. The first preview train, carrying 400members of the press and media, was delayed for two hours by technical problems.|$|E
5|$|When Stewie {{starts to}} feel pain around {{the inside of}} his mouth, Lois notices and states that he is <b>teething.</b> Stewie quickly {{responds}} by asking her to kill him, or to shake him like a British nanny, a reference to the Louise Woodward case.|$|E
5|$|Work {{later in}} the year {{included}} the finishing of the fourth sail, balancing the fantail and sorting out <b>teething</b> troubles with the fantail gearing. The brake and brake lever were made and installed and shutter cranks for the sails were cast.|$|E
5|$|Designed at British Railways' Derby Works, the {{new class}} was {{constructed}} at British Railways' Crewe Works between 1951 and 1954. The initial order was for 25 locomotives, but {{such was the}} demand for the Britannias on the Eastern Region that more were rushed through construction before the <b>teething</b> problems had been ironed out on the prototypes. In total, 55 {{members of the class}} were constructed over three batches at Crewe Works, where each was given improvements to improve reliability and efficiency, and to overcome flaws with the original design.|$|E
5|$|For the U.S. program {{there were}} <b>teething</b> troubles. There {{was a lack}} of {{sufficient}} numbers of sensor strings and controlling the number of aircraft available for the missions proved problematic. These difficulties could be remedied. Commando Hunt II (1 May through 31 October 1969), however, was thrown off track by phenomena that the Air Force could do absolutely nothing about. The first wet season offensive was hampered by atrocious weather, especially heavy rain (48inches of rain in July alone).|$|E
5|$|While Argentina's {{finances}} {{were extremely}} strained {{at this juncture}} following the economic crisis in 1953, the most serious setback to the project came in January 1955 when Tank's contract expired. He reputedly requested almost twice as much money to continue but President Perón instead canceled his contract outright. Despite four years of development and trials, the IAe 33 project was still encountering <b>teething</b> problems and its status remained unclear although no final decision {{had been made to}} abandon a project that had reached iconic stature in the Perónist era.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham was {{promoted}} to acting squadron leader in September 1940, commanding B Flight. Within the month the unit received the heavily armed and powerful Bristol Beaufighter. After the commanding officer, Cunningham was the second man to fly it. The Beaufighter went through a <b>teething</b> stage in relation to its gun sight. The sight projected a ring of light with a spot at the centre onto a small sheet of glass {{directly in front of}} the pilots head. The spot in the centre provided the aiming point, and the ring, of variable diameter, helped him to judge the rage and amount of deflection needed to attack a target. The light's brilliance was adjustable by rheostat, but the control was ineffective. Rotating it a fraction could produce maximum brilliance or cause the spot to flicker out.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three years the Combined Bomber Offensive had forced the Luftwaffe to invest heavily in air defence. In the {{campaign}} against the RAF, the German air defence system, named the Kammhuber Line, had become increasingly sophisticated. In 1942 the introduction of Lichtenstein radar, despite its early <b>teething</b> difficulties, and greater improvements in the armament and capability of German night fighters produced a force capable of inflicting heavy losses on British bomber streams. Though British losses rarely reached more than ten percent of a raid—considered a minimum target to irreparably damage British combat power—the night fighter force grew in size and potency. British losses in the Battle of the Ruhr (March–July 1943) and most notably in the Battle of Berlin (November 1943 – March 1944) reached an all-time high; 569 bombers in the latter campaign.|$|E
5|$|The first {{operations}} in 1940 concerned Operation Sea Lion, the planned invasion of Britain by the Wehrmacht. The unit was to receive 30 PR Supermarine Spitfire aircraft, specialised and adapted for reconnaissance use. They would {{be capable of}} 1,750 miles round trips. However, just 13 aircraft were available to the unit, and their range limited to 1,300 miles. Eventually, an assortment of Vickers Wellington and Spitfire flights were established. In August 1940, the first PR Spitfires arrived, but <b>teething</b> problems ensured {{that it would be a}} long time before standardisation was achieved with equipment. In August, Coastal Command flew 193 sorties over the suspected invasion ports in the Netherlands, Belgium and France.|$|E
5|$|Upstairs, Stewie takes drastic {{measures}} to protect his plans, programming the machine {{to go back in}} time before he drew them up. In the bar, Peter and Lois have a heart-to-heart conversation, and they do not immediately notice that the bar is burning. When they try to escape, the stairs become blocked and they are trapped. Stewie reverses time just as Peter is having an epiphany about how poorly he treats Lois, and seconds before the basement bar goes up in flames. They all travel back in time, to when Lois asked Peter to take Chris to the game. While he is getting ready, Peter trips on Stewie's time machine, destroying it and injuring his leg, thus preventing him from taking Chris to his soccer match, while Stewie is left to suffer with more <b>teething</b> pain.|$|E
5|$|XXI Bomber Command {{arrived on}} Saipan on October 12, 1944, {{and from the}} start Hansell was beset {{by a host of}} serious command problems, the worst of which were {{continued}} <b>teething</b> problems with the B-29, tardy delivery of aircraft, aircrews untrained in high altitude formation flying, primitive airfield conditions, lack of an air service command for logistical support, no repair depots, a total absence of target intelligence, stubborn internal resistance to daylight operations by his sole combat wing, subordinates in the XXI Bomber Command who lobbied for his removal, and Hansell’s inferiority in rank in dealing with other AAF commanders in the theater. Furthermore, Hansell was soon prohibited from flying combat missions with his command, possibly because of limited knowledge of the atomic bomb or the perception that he knew the existence of Ultra.|$|E
5|$|Bootham Crescent was renovated {{over the}} summer of 1932; the Main and Popular Stands were built and {{terraces}} were banked up behind the goals. The ground was officially opened on 31 August 1932, for York's 2–2 draw with Stockport County in the Third Division North. It was played before 8,106 supporters, and York's Tom Mitchell scored the first goal at the ground. There were <b>teething</b> problems in Bootham Crescent's early years: attendances were not higher than at Fulfordgate in its first four seasons, and there were questions over {{the quality of the}} pitch. In March 1938 the ground's record attendance was set when 28,123 people watched York play Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup. The ground endured slight damage during the Second World War, when bombs were dropped on houses along the Shipton Street End. Improvements were made shortly after the war ended, including the concreting of the banking at the Grosvenor Road End being completed.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>teething</b> {{problems}} with the Ju 87, the RLM ordered 216 Ju 87 A-1s into production and wanted to receive delivery of all machines between January 1936 and 1938. The Junkers production capacity was fully occupied and licensing to other production facilities became necessary. The first 35 Ju 87 A-1s were therefore produced by the Weser Flugzeugbau (WFG). By 1 September 1939, 360 Ju 87 As and Bs had been built by the Junkers factories at Dessau and Weserflug factory in Lemwerder near Bremen. By 30 September 1939, Junkers had received 2,365,196 Reichsmark (RM) for Ju 87 construction orders. The RLM paid another 243,646 RM for development orders. According to audit records in Berlin, {{by the end of}} the financial year on 30 September 1941, 3,059,000 RM had been spent on Ju 87 airframes. By 30 June 1940, 697 Ju 87 B-1s and 129 B-2s alone had been produced. Another 105 R-1s and seven R-2s had been built.|$|E
5|$|Mercury(I) {{chloride}} (also {{known as}} calomel or mercurous chloride) {{has been used}} in traditional medicine as a diuretic, topical disinfectant, and laxative. Mercury(II) chloride (also known as mercuric chloride or corrosive sublimate) was once used to treat syphilis (along with other mercury compounds), although it is so toxic that sometimes the symptoms of its toxicity were confused with those of the syphilis it was believed to treat. It is also used as a disinfectant. Blue mass, a pill or syrup in which mercury is the main ingredient, was prescribed throughout the 19th century for numerous conditions including constipation, depression, child-bearing and toothaches. In the early 20th century, mercury was administered to children yearly as a laxative and dewormer, and it was used in <b>teething</b> powders for infants. The mercury-containing organohalide merbromin (sometimes sold as Mercurochrome) is still widely used but has been banned in some countries such as the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Romania ordered 126 of {{the tanks}} on 14 August 1936 as the R-2 and {{received}} the first 15, which had been diverted from the Czech order, in April–May 1937 to display in a parade. They suffered from numerous <b>teething</b> problems and the Romanians put a hold on production until these issues were resolved. The constantly changing Romanian demands didn't help the situation, but they refused to accept any vehicles until trials were conducted in Romania. Three R-2s were shipped to Romania on 12 July 1938 for the trials, but Skoda knew which one would be chosen and prepared the vehicle well and it passed all tests. After disassembly and checks of the trial tank were completed, the Romanian commission approved the design on 23 August. In the meantime, the initial batch was returned to Skoda to be upgraded to current standards on 28 July. Shipments to Romania began on 1 September with 27 shipped before the Munich Crisis forced the Czechs to hold all remaining tanks in case they were needed. 5 finished tanks and 6 almost-finished tanks were appropriated and shipped to Slovakia although they were quickly returned after the Munich Agreement was signed. The last shipment departed on 22 February 1939.|$|E
25|$|<b>Teething</b> {{is not a}} cause.|$|E
25|$|Lidocaine viscous is not {{recommended}} by the FDA to treat <b>teething</b> pain in children and infants.|$|E
25|$|The first {{locomotive}} {{was delivered}} in June 1989 {{and sent to}} Derby for testing, which revealed a number of <b>teething</b> problems. Parts requiring modifications included the axle box suspension and the Mirlees engine cylinder head.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} the Class 800s was {{introduced}} into passenger service on 16 October 2017. However, <b>teething</b> problems surfaced on the inaugural service, with a leaking air conditioning unit and the train running late.|$|E
25|$|Near {{the main}} drive that passes {{by the church}} are four small {{matching}} tombstones with inscriptions recording the deaths of seven children of the York and Free families. These and many other tombstones reflect the high infant mortality of the 19th century. The burial dockets indicate that many children died of diphtheria and measles, with one measles outbreak resulting in the burials of up to twelve children a day. Strangely, to the modern reader, the major cause of death of infants below {{the age of two}} years is given as <b>teething.</b> It is now understood that these deaths resulted from the use of mercury-based <b>teething</b> powders.|$|E
25|$|Ahern's first {{government}} {{saw some}} <b>teething</b> problems {{during its first}} six months. Firstly, Ahern tried to nominate David Andrews as Minister for Defence and as Junior Minister at the Department of Foreign Affairs. This was unconstitutional as one minister cannot be subordinate to another.|$|E
25|$|The Vigilante's early service proved troublesome, {{with many}} <b>teething</b> {{problems}} for its advanced systems. Although these systems were highly sophisticated, {{the technology was}} in its infancy, and its reliability was poor. Although most of these reliability issues were eventually worked out as maintenance personnel gained greater experience with supporting these systems, the aircraft tended to remain a maintenance-intensive platform throughout its career.|$|E
25|$|In February 1945, Major General Gladeon M. Barnes, {{chief of}} the Research and Development Section of Army Ordnance, {{personally}} led a special team to the European Theater, called the Zebra Mission. Its purpose was to support the T26E3 tanks, which still had <b>teething</b> problems, {{as well as to}} test other new weapons. In March, the T26E3 tanks were redesignated as the M26.|$|E
25|$|The second series follows Kim's {{pregnancy}} and her rekindled relationship with Brett. Kath and Kel's relationship goes through some <b>teething</b> troubles. Kim and Brett {{have a baby}} in the final episode of the second series whom they name Epponn'knee-Raelene Kathleen Darlene Charlene Craig, shortened to Epponn'knee-Rae. Several episodes of the third series focus on Epponn'knee-Rae. The third-season finale features an adult Epponn'knee-Rae, played by Kylie Minogue.|$|E
25|$|North American F-86A/E/F SabreThe F-86 Sabre survived many initial <b>teething</b> {{problems}} {{to become the}} premier USAF fighter of the Korean War. By the end of hostilities, Saber pilots claimed 792 MiGs shot down, {{with a loss of}} only 78 Sabres-a victory ratio of 10-to-1. Later models of the F-86 were more powerful and used both for air-to-air and ground support. The RF-86 was used for reconnaissance.|$|E
25|$|When he {{returned}} for another {{tour of duty}} in early 1918, 19 Squadron had become the first unit to be equipped with the new Sopwith Dolphin. The squadron returned to operations on 13 February 1918. There followed a period of <b>teething</b> problems with the new aircraft. To add to these difficulties, the Dolphins were attacked by fellow British pilots because the unfamiliar Dolphin was assumed to be German.|$|E
25|$|After serious initial <b>teething</b> problems, which {{involved}} door mechanism malfunctions {{that led to}} a recall of all Budapest Combino trams by Siemens, the trams were in regular service during 2006. After they had been repaired, Budapest's government decided that they would return them to Siemens. However, this did not happen because of contractual terms. The local public transport company began using them in 2007 and now they are working successfully again.|$|E
25|$|Both the F1CZ and F1AZ {{variants}} of the South African Air Force (SAAF) saw considerable action during {{operations in the}} Border War. In November 1978, the first five F1CZs were deployed to South-West Africa (Namibia), tasked with providing escort for reconnaissance flights over Southern Angola. From 1980, such deployments as escort aircraft became regular. Due to <b>teething</b> problems with the F1AZ, F1CZs were initially assigned the strike role in southern Angola using Matra M155 rocket pods or 250kg bombs.|$|E
25|$|Camphor was a {{component}} of paregoric, an opium/camphor tincture developed in the 18th century. Paregoric was used in various formulations for hundreds of years. It was a household remedy in the 18th and 19th centuries when it was widely used to control diarrhea in adults and children, as an expectorant and cough medicine, to calm fretful children, and to rub on the gums to counteract the pain from <b>teething.</b> Its use declined in the 20th century after the regulation of opium.|$|E
25|$|Orders {{eventually}} totalling 70 locomotives {{were placed}} with the North British Locomotive Company of Glasgow. Once initial <b>teething</b> problems were overcome, R class locomotives {{proved to be}} a success and their power and speed enabled faster timetabled services. However, they were almost immediately superseded by mainline diesel-electric and electric locomotives on the VR from 1952 onwards. With successive orders of diesel-electric locomotives through the 1950s and 1960s gradually displacing them, all but seven of the class were withdrawn and cut up for scrap.|$|E
25|$|Rhizomes of the German Iris (I. germanica) and Sweet Iris (I. pallida) are traded as {{orris root}} {{and are used}} in perfume and medicine, though more common in ancient times than today. Today Iris {{essential}} oil (absolute) from flowers are sometimes used in aromatherapy as sedative medicines. The dried rhizomes are also given whole to babies to help in <b>teething.</b> Gin brands such as Bombay Sapphire and Magellan Gin use orris root and sometimes iris flowers for flavor and color.|$|E
25|$|The first {{production}} P-36As {{were delivered}} to the 20th Pursuit Group at Barksdale Field in Louisiana in April 1938. The aircraft's service history was marred by numerous <b>teething</b> problems with the engine exhaust, skin buckling over landing gear, and weak points in the airframe, severely restricting the performance envelope. By the time these issues were resolved, the P-36 was considered obsolete and was relegated to training units and overseas detachments at Albrook Field in the Panama Canal Zone, Elmendorf Field in Alaska, and Wheeler Field in Hawaii.|$|E
25|$|Certain UK bloodlines {{suffer from}} an acute <b>teething</b> {{disorder}} in young kittens, where {{the eruption of}} the second teeth causes extreme discomfort and the young cat tears at its face to try to alleviate the pain. Veterinary intervention is not useful, {{since it is the}} eruption of the new teeth in the jaw that causes the problem; these cannot be removed until they have erupted, by which time the problem ceases. Apart from scarring caused by the self-mutilation, the cat seems to recover completely.|$|E
25|$|In the Icelandic books the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, Freyr is {{presented}} {{as one of the}} Vanir, the son of the sea god Njörðr, as well as the twin brother of the goddess Freyja. The gods gave him Álfheimr, the realm of the Elves, as a <b>teething</b> present. He rides the shining dwarf-made boar Gullinbursti and possesses the ship Skíðblaðnir which always has a favorable breeze and can be folded together and carried in a pouch when it is not being used. He has the servants Skírnir, Byggvir and Beyla.|$|E
