In 1994, Hulsman became a correspondent for several Dutch media outlets in Egypt, and with his Egyptian wife Sawsan Gabra Ayoub Khalil, founded in 1997 the From 1999-2001, at the request of the American University Press in Cairo, Hulsman carried out research on the Coptic Orthodox Holy Family tradition and compared this with earlier work carried out by Dr. Otto F.A. Meinardus in the 1950s and 1960s. Hulsman's work resulted in the chapter “Tracing the Route of the Holy Family Today,” in the book “Be Thou There; The Holy Family's Journey in Egypt,” AUC Press, 2001. Following this research and publication, numerous magazine and newspaper publications on aspects of the Holy Family tradition followed. Hulsman also organized tens of visits to locations related to this tradition, built a Web site about this tradition and has become one of the world's foremost experts on this ancient Coptic tradition.In 2000 and 2001, Hulsman was the adjunct affiliate assistant professor in Journalism and Mass Communication at the American University in Cairo, and in 2002 organized a workshop for Egyptian journalists regarding reporting on human rights.Hulsman decided devote his attention to developing an Egyptian institute for inter-cultural understanding, changed the name of the electronic digest RNSAW in 2003 to Arab-West Report. Following this, Hulsman initiated with a group of prominent Egyptians the [...] CAWU then applied for Egyptian Non-Government Organization (NGO) status, which was obtained following a long bureaucratic process in January 2008.In 2004 Hulsman initiated the construction of an electronic library based on the reviews of Egyptian media and his own investigative reporting in the Religious News Service from the Arab World and Arab-West Report since 1997.Because of the delays in forming an Egyptian NGO, in 2005 Hulsman and his wife founded the Center for Intercultural Dialogue and Translation (CIDT). CIDT has become the institute preparing media reviews and translations for Arab-West Report.In May 2006, Hulsman organized the visit of former Dutch Prime Minister Andreas van Agt to Egypt, who lectured at universities and institutions in Cairo about the need for Arab-West understanding and met with prominent government officials in which he expressed strong support for the initiative to create a Center for Arab-West Understanding.Hulsman became in August 2007 the project director of <b>the</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Network</b> for Arab-West Understanding (ENAWU).

40|$|Abstract. Although {{there has}} been a {{significant}} increase in networked communication and a growing interest in technology-supported knowledge management, to date the basic assumption by researchers and practitioners alike has been that individuals value the open sharing of knowledge. However, {{there has been}} little research into what happens when organizations try to promote the open sharing of “secret ” or proprietary knowledge. A theoretical model and set of hypotheses that integrate social network theories with interdependence theory, has been used to illuminate the described case study with a network of communicators in a large global corporate setting. This model suggests that the sharing of an individual’s proprietary knowledge in electronic networks is influenced not only by an individual’s self interest and simple reciprocity but also by the individual’s social and organizational context. Proprietary knowledge exchange within an intra-organizational electronic network focused on discussions of work practice is dependent upon 1) the size of <b>the</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>network</b> 2) the structure of ties that emerge through individual interactions in <b>the</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>network,</b> 3) the relational quality of ties that develop between individuals in <b>the</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>network,</b> 4) the relational ties individuals have with the organization, and 5) the individual attributes extended to <b>the</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>network.</b> This has been shown in a set of corporate stories, relating to the practice, and how it evolves, using a set of emerging technologies to support their practice. 1 A case study on Knowledge Exchange and Internal News flows, with ENOP’s (Communicators...|$|E

Techniques used to study these systems include global and local stabiJity analysis, statisticaI methods originaIly developed for Ising-model spin glasses and neural networks, numerical simulation, and experiments on a small (S-neuron) electronic neural network. Attention is focused mostly on networks with symmetric connections. The analog neurons are taken to have a smooth and monotonic transfer function, characterized by a gain (i. e. maximum slope) f 3. <b>The</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>network</b> includes time delay circuitry at each neuron.

This thesis addresses the use of <b>the</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>networked</b> medium in <b>the</b> activity of library communication and aims to discover design knowledge for communication tools and processes directed towards this particular area. A model of library communication is provided that describes interaction among programmer as webs of interrelated library communities. A discussion of <b>electronic,</b> <b>networked</b> tools and processes that match such a model is also provided. Furthermore, research results are provided from the design and industrial valuation of electronic reference documentation for the Java domain. Surprisingly, the evaluation did not support individual adaptation (personalization). Furthermore, global library communication processes have been studied in relation to open-source documentation and user-related bug handling. Open-source documentation projects are still relatively uncommon even in open-source software projects. User-related Open-source does not address the passive behavior users have towards bugs. Finally, the adaptive authoring process in electronic reference documentation is addressed and found to provide limited support for expressing <b>the</b> <b>electronic,</b> <b>networked</b> dimensions of authoring requiring programming skill by technical writers. Library communication is addressed here by providing engineering knowledge with regards to the construction of practical <b>electronic,</b> <b>networked</b> tools and processes in the area.
