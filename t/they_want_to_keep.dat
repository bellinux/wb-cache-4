25|$|In {{the first}} two series, acts usually chose a cover of a pop {{standard}} or contemporary hit. In series 1, much {{was made of the}} idea that each performer/mentor combination was free to present the performance however they wanted, including performer playing live instruments, or the addition of choirs, backing bands, and dancers. From the third series, each live show has had a different theme; each contestant's song is chosen according to the theme. A celebrity guest connected to the theme is often invited onto the show, and clips are shown of the guest conversing with the contestants at rehearsal. After each act has performed, the judges comment on their performance. Heated disagreements, usually involving judges defending their contestants against criticism, are a regular feature of the show. Once all the acts have appeared, the phone lines open and the viewing public vote on which act <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep.</b>|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} in 1995 Lawrence Gordon Clark stated that the stories [...] "focus on suggestion. The aim, they say, is to chill rather than shock. Partly because television is not best suited to carrying off big-screen pyrotechnics, but mainly because <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> faith {{with the notion of}} a ghost story in its literary rather than cinematic tradition." [...] Helen Wheatley notes that the best adaptations maintain the stories' [...] "sense of decorum and restraint, ... withholding the full revelation of the supernatural until the very last moment, and centring on the suggestion of a ghostly presence rather than the horror of visceral excess and abjection." ...|$|E

Where do you hide the fuel, how do you make this stuff up, how do you align it. Because when you {{disassemble}} it, there is a process called re-alignment. There is a factory involved in that. And then you have to test launch it to make sure that the alignment works, and that's detectable, and they haven't done that. There is a lot of common sense things that go into consideration of whether or not Iraq has a operational weapons of mass destruction capability.|$|E

2500|$|The community's {{budget for}} each year needs to be {{discharged}} by the Parliament following its report by the European Court of Auditors. It had only refused to do so once previously, in 1984. Towards the end of 1998 the Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control initially refused to discharge the community's budget for 1996 over what it saw as the arrogance of the Commission in its refusal to answer questions relating to financial mismanagement.

For season 3 final, [...] judges' score and public votes both constituted 50% overall combined result. This percentage allocation was reversed for season 2, but was reverted to the original ratios starting from the semi-final rounds. Once the number of contestants has been reduced to four contestants, these contestants go on to appear in the grand final which decides the overall winner.|$|E
