40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{interaction}} between revenue sharing and quality of order fulfillment that occurs in an Internet drop-shipping distribution system comprising an e-tailer and a <b>supplier.</b> <b>The</b> e-tailer manages sales activities and sends customer orders to <b>the</b> <b>supplier,</b> while <b>the</b> <b>supplier</b> fulfills <b>the</b> order. With drop-shipping strategy, the e-tailer cannot monitor or control <b>the</b> <b>supplier's</b> shipping operations and takes the risk of loss due to <b>the</b> <b>supplier's</b> inefficient deliveries. Using a Stackelberg game, we explore how the e-tailer (leader) can give <b>the</b> <b>supplier</b> (follower) appropriate incentive to improve the level of delivery reliability. We also address whether and when <b>the</b> <b>supplier</b> is willing to share its private cost information with the e-tailer. Since the e-tailer is always better off by knowing <b>the</b> <b>supplier's</b> private information, we study three possible strategies for the e-tailer to extract more accurate cost information from <b>the</b> <b>supplier.</b> Among them, we find that strategic partnership and utilization of information leakage are feasible strategies while a side payment is not. ...|$|R
5|$|In October 2012, {{with the}} project still unfinished, the museum {{published}} a report examining {{the reasons for the}} delay and additional cost. It found that the museum had greatly underestimated the work required due to the poor condition of the locomotive, much of which had been missed by a rushed inspection, which produced an overly optimistic assessment which was not based on engineering realities. It also found that once the project was underway, management lacked the experience, continuity or resources to undertake such a complex task, which was also hampered by illness and recruitment issues. Although the museum had a formal contract system to manage suppliers, managers failed to implement it properly, and it was ill-suited to the cottage industry nature of the heritage railway sector which <b>the</b> <b>suppliers</b> were largely drawn from, many of whom had failed to meet their contractual targets. Problems were also caused by the conflicting objectives of producing a certified main line locomotive while retaining as many original components and assemblies as possible, and between the need to overhaul the locomotive {{and use it as a}} marketing tool for the museum. The report recommended that the NRM consider the scope, size and responsibilities of their project management and engineering functions, and their contracting policy.|$|E

Verkhovsky, having no time to place orders with reliable foreign suppliers, contracted the job to local plants already known for poor discipline and quality that were already loaded down with other Navy jobs. The industrial capacity of the Saint Petersburg area could not sustain even the modest rate of naval rearmament {{that the government was}} willing to finance. In April 1893 minor grievances evolved in a full-scale conflict between Verkhovsky and the board of the Alexandrovsky Steel Works, a ridiculous charge of 25 roubles nearly brought the work to a full stop.

5|$|The Commercial Import Program {{was created}} in January 1955, {{immediately}} upon the transfer of France's remaining direct influence over the State of Vietnam to the chief of state, former Emperor Bảo Đại and his Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem. The Americans and Diem feared a communist electoral victory and national polls never took place. In October, Diem proclaimed himself {{the president of the}} newly formed Republic of Vietnam after he won a fraudulent referendum, and the aid continued as the US wanted to build a strong and stable anti-communist state in Southeast Asia. When the program was first introduced, it generated turbulence for merchant importers in Vietnam. As {{a large proportion of the}} imports up to that point had been from France, traders who were dependent on selling French products found themselves in difficulties as their wares would now be more expensive than those of import licenseholders who now had access to cheaper American alternatives. <b>The</b> <b>suppliers</b> of French goods threatened to organize a strike, but this never materialized. At the time, South Vietnam was also suffering from a lack of foreign currency reserves and the CIP was seen as an urgent mechanism of remedying this. The introduction of the CIP brought an unprecedented new level of economic liberalism and capitalism, and at first, the entrepreneurial class struggled to meet the challenges of a deregulated market, leading to a series of significant shortages and surpluses of various goods due to their inexperience in judging market forces and resultant imbalances in the economy. Initially 25,000 applications for import licenses were received, many from speculators. In the early years of the initiative, a proportion of the US funding for the CIP came through the proceeds of the sale of surplus American agricultural products to France.|$|E

25|$|In the 18th century, Cremonese luthiers were <b>the</b> <b>suppliers</b> {{and local}} {{players on the}} demand side. After Stradivari's death, this {{drastically}} changed. Although the Cremonese luthiers remained <b>the</b> <b>suppliers,</b> the demand side consisted of collectors, researchers, imitators, profiteers and speculators.

It is then that the so-called 'fever' for Stradivaris took off. Cozio, Tarisio and Vuillaume were the fathers of this frenzy that would extend well into the 21st century. Also, soon after Stradivari's death, most of the other major Cremonese luthiers would die, putting an end to the golden period of Cremona's violin making, which lasted more than 150 years, starting with the Amatis and ending with the Cerutis.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to identify the functions of <b>the</b> <b>supplier</b> to <b>the</b> client firms and explore the impacts of these functions on the relationship quality. For the client firm, what functions of <b>the</b> <b>supplier</b> relationship are really expected and what functions are not so important? The answers to these questions may guide client firms in the selection of <b>the</b> strategic <b>suppliers</b> and guide <b>the</b> <b>supplier</b> firms on how {{to meet the demands of}} the client firms, resulting in a better cooperative relationship. In addition, other variables have impacts on the process in which <b>the</b> functions of <b>supplier</b> quality influence <b>the</b> relationship quality. The findings are as follows. The client firm with different nature of ownership does not perceive the direct functions of supplier relationship differently, but it perceives the indirect functions differently. Foreign invested firm values the long term development of the relationship with <b>the</b> <b>supplier,</b> implying that it emphasize the indirect functions of <b>the</b> <b>supplier</b> more than <b>the</b> state-owned or domestic private firm. Large firms have higher requirements on the indirect functions than medium sized and small firms. Foreign invested firms are easier to have trust in its supplier and make commitment with <b>the</b> <b>supplier,</b> thus enjoying higher relationship quality than state-owned or domestic private businesses. The duration of the relationship impacts the client on the perception of the functions of <b>the</b> <b>supplier</b> relationship. <b>The</b> longer cooperation history leads to the client's higher requirement on the cost function and the indirect functions and leads to the higher degree of trust of the client in <b>the</b> <b>supplier.</b> <b>The</b> functions of <b>the</b> <b>supplier</b> relationship significantly impact on the B 2 B relationship quality. The cost, quality, innovation development and market functions have more influences on the client's commitment with <b>the</b> <b>supplier.</b> <b>The</b> quality, social support and innovation development functions have more influences on the client's trust in <b>the</b> <b>supplier.</b> <b>The</b> quality, scout and market functions are negatively related to the conflict dimension of the relationship quality...|$|R
40|$|We study a drop-shipping {{supply chain}} {{in which the}} {{retailer}} receives a customer's order and <b>the</b> <b>supplier</b> fills it. In such a chain, <b>the</b> <b>supplier</b> keeps inventory and bears inventory risks; the retailer focuses on marketing and customer acquisition, and forwards the orders to <b>the</b> <b>supplier.</b> <b>The</b> retailer usually has better customer demand information, and may send an over-estimated demand forecast to maximize her own interest, which may result in overstock for <b>the</b> <b>supplier.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, since the retailer does not own inventory, the main concern of the retailer is that the acquired orders may not be fulfilled because of <b>the</b> <b>supplier's</b> shortage of stock. To cope with these challenges, we propose a menu of commitment-penalty contracts that can provide greater certainty of demand as well as greater certainty of supply.

25|$|Few social {{networks}} charge money for membership. In part, {{this may be}} because social networking is a relatively new service, and the value of using them has not been firmly established in customers' minds. Companies such as Myspace and Facebook sell online advertising on their site. Their business model is based upon large membership count, and charging for membership would be counterproductive. Some believe that the deeper information that the sites have on each user will allow much better targeted advertising than any other site can currently provide. In recent times, Apple has been critical of the Google and Facebook model, in which users are defined as product and a commodity, and their data being sold for marketing revenue. Social networks operate under an autonomous business model, in which a social network's members serve dual roles as both <b>the</b> <b>suppliers</b> and the consumers of content. This is in contrast to a traditional business model, where <b>the</b> <b>suppliers</b> and consumers are distinct agents.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} quality improvement efforts coordination in a two-stage decentralised supply chain with a partial cost allocation contract. The supply chain consists of one supplier and one manufacturer, {{both of which}} produce defective products. Two kinds of failure cost occur within the supply chain: internal and external. <b>The</b> <b>supplier</b> and <b>the</b> manufacturer determine their individual quality levels to maximise their own profits. We propose a partial cost allocation contract, under which the external failure cost is allocated between the manufacturer and <b>the</b> <b>supplier</b> at different rates based on information derived from failure root cause analysis. If the quality levels of <b>the</b> <b>supplier</b> and <b>the</b> manufacturer are observable, we show that the partial cost allocation contract coordinates the supply chain, provided that the failure root cause analysis does not erroneously identify the manufacturer’s fault as <b>the</b> <b>supplier’s,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>supplier</b> does not {{take responsibility for the}} manufacture’s fault. In the single moral hazard model, where only the quality level of <b>the</b> <b>supplier</b> is unobservable, <b>the</b> optimal share rates require <b>the</b> <b>supplier</b> to take some responsibility for the manufacture’s fault. However, in the double moral hazard model, where quality levels of <b>the</b> <b>supplier</b> and <b>the</b> manufacturer are unobservable to each other, the optimal share rates require <b>the</b> <b>supplier</b> not {{to take responsibility for the}} manufacturer’s fault. It is noted that the root cause analysis conducted by the manufacturer may have its disadvantage in attributing the fault to <b>the</b> <b>supplier</b> when both sides are at fault. We also propose a contract based on the dual root cause analysis to reduce <b>the</b> <b>supplier’s</b> penalty cost.
