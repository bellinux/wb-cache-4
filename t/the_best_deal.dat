5|$|Before {{the inquiry}} opened, a poll was {{conducted}} in Tunstall where ratepayers of the town showed themselves to be in favour of federation. As the council itself had voted against federation, it decided not to oppose or support federation but instead to achieve <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>deal</b> it could for the town. The three-day inquiry opened on 8 January 1908 and was chaired by Major Norton, {{an officer of the}} Local Government Board. Norton's appointment itself caused controversy with the delegation from Burslem walking out on the first day protesting that Norton had already declared himself in favour of federation. The walkout did not disrupt the hearing but left only Fenton and Staffordshire County Council opposed to the plan, with Tunstall neutral and Hanley, Stoke and Longton in favour. The bulk of the inquiry examined rating schemes based largely on the Owen or Geen proposals from the previous federation attempt.|$|E
5|$|The limited {{scope of}} the Instruments of Accession {{and the promise of}} a wide-ranging {{autonomy}} and the other guarantees they offered, gave sufficient comfort to many rulers, who saw this as <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>deal</b> they could strike given the lack of support from the British, and popular internal pressures. Between May 1947 and the transfer of power on 15 August 1947, the vast majority of states signed Instruments of Accession. A few, however, held out. Some simply delayed signing the Instrument of Accession. Piploda, a small state in central India, did not accede until March 1948. The biggest problems, however, arose with a few border states, such as Jodhpur, which tried to negotiate better deals with Pakistan, with Junagadh, which actually did accede to Pakistan, and with Hyderabad and Kashmir, which declared that they intended to remain independent.|$|E

His relations with Shevardnadze grew frosty {{at the end of the}} 1990s, as he and the government traded accusations of corruption and treason.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{the summer}} of 1754, {{on the eve of the}} French and Indian War, Weiser was a member of a Pennsylvania {{delegation}} to Albany. London had invoked the meeting, hoping to win assurances of Iroquois support in the looming war with the French. Present were representatives of the Iroquois and seven colonies. Because of divisions within both the British and Native American ranks, the council did not result in the treaty of support that the crown desired. Instead, each colony made <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>deal</b> it could with individual Iroquois leaders. Weiser was able to negotiate one of the more successful, in which some lower-level chiefs deeded to the colony most of the land remaining in present-day Pennsylvania, including the southwestern part, still claimed by Virginia.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{following}} the treaty, unalloted Chickasaw land was quickly occupied by white settlers {{even though the}} treaty was supposed to stall white settlement until the Chickasaw relocated. Between 1832 and 1837, the Chickasaw made several further negotiations, {{in part because of}} the reluctance of the Senate to confirm Pontotoc and {{in part because of the}} Chickasaws' dissatisfaction with finding new land. The Treaty of Washington in 1834 confirmed Pontotoc. In addition it even allowed for the enlargement of the Chickasaw temporary homesteads to be sold, and guaranteed the right of the Chickasaw to receive the revenue for each improved homestead sold. The chiefs were concerned to make <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>deal</b> in terms of sale and of acquiring new land for the Chickasaw people.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{remaining}} {{neutral in}} the conflict, however, Habibullah {{did in fact}} accept a Turkish-German mission in Kabul and military assistance from the Central Powers as he attempted to play {{both sides of the}} conflict for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>deal.</b> Through continual prevarication he resisted numerous requests for assistance, however he failed to keep in check troublesome tribal leaders, intent on undermining British rule in India, as Turkish agents attempted to foment trouble along the frontier. The departure of {{a large part of the}} British Indian Army to fight overseas and news of British defeats at the hands of the Turks aided Turkish agents in efforts at sedition, and in 1915 there was unrest amongst the Mohmands and then the Mahsuds. Notwithstanding these outbreaks, the frontier generally remained settled at a time when Britain could ill afford trouble.|$|E

25|$|When Antony {{attempted}} {{to take control}} of Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy) by force and displace Decimus Brutus, the Senate led by Cicero called on Lepidus to support Brutus – one of Caesar's killers. Lepidus prevaricated, recommending negotiation with Antony. After Antony's defeat at the Battle of Mutina, the Senate sent word that Lepidus' troops were no longer needed. Antony, however, marched towards Lepidus's province with his remaining forces. Lepidus continued to assure the Senate of his loyalty, but engaged in negotiations with Antony. When the two armies met, large portions of Lepidus's forces joined up with Antony. Lepidus negotiated an agreement with him, while claiming to the Senate that he had no choice. It is unclear whether Lepidus' troops forced him to join with Antony, whether that was always Lepidus's plan, or whether he arranged matters to gauge the situation and make <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>deal.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ducharme {{also criticized}} Moscoe for {{granting}} a non-bid contract to Bombardier {{for the purchase}} of new subway cars, citing an estimate from rival company Siemens suggesting that it would cost Toronto as much as $100 million. Ducharme and several councillors had advocated making the process open to competition, arguing that this would result in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>deal</b> for the city. Moscoe defended his decision by noting that Bombardier plans to construct the cars in Thunder Bay, Ontario with parts-supply work in Toronto, while Siemens would have exported construction to China. He also cited a Bombardier-initiated study asserting that the contract will generate $142 million in provincial and federal tax revenues. Moscoe has also defended the contracting process, arguing that non-competitive contracts are standard practice for such purchases in other jurisdictions. He later added that he initially considered an open-bid contract, but reconsidered after discovering that Siemens constructs its cars in China.|$|E

Volvos 151–160 were repainted into a new branding for route 49, The Queen of Scots with 136–138 and 170 now repainted into standard madder and white.

500|$|The Giants were {{credited}} with pulling off <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>deal</b> of the year, with Larsen and Pierce – [...] "the little southpaw chatterbox" [...] – leading {{the team to}} {{the best record in}} the major leagues through early June. In a road game against the Reds on June 14, he allowed a leadoff double to Vada Pinson, but was then accidentally spiked in the left ankle while covering first base on a groundout by Don Blasingame, an injury which required 14 stitches. Pulled from the game after just ⅓ of an inning, he took the loss when Pinson later scored and the Giants were shut out 8–0. The injury likely cost him what would have been his eighth All-Star selection, and he did not return to the field until he lasted only three innings in a loss on July 15; he then made three relief appearances before picking up a win on August 2. But over the course of the year he proved to be a pitcher who thrived in blustery Candlestick Park, winning all 11 of his home starts as the Giants tied the Dodgers for the NL pennant with a record of 101–61, forcing a three-game playoff. Against the Dodgers on August 11 he earned his 200th career victory, with McCovey's three-run home run off eventual Cy Young winner Don Drysdale giving the Giants a 5–4 win and ending Drysdale's 11-game win streak.|$|E

2500|$|Carr, however, {{has argued}} that the Soviet Union's {{replacement}} of Litvinov with Molotov on May 3, 1939, indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with Germany, but rather was Stalin’s way of engaging in hard bargaining with the British and the French by appointing a tough negotiator, namely Molotov, to the Foreign Commissariat. Albert Resis argued that the replacement of Litvinov by Molotov was both a warning to Britain and a signal to Germany. [...] Derek Watson argued that Molotov could get <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>deal</b> with Britain and France because he was not encumbered with the baggage of collective security and could more easily negotiate with Germany. [...] Geoffrey Roberts argued that Litvinov's dismissal helped the Soviets with British-French talks, because Litvinov doubted or maybe even opposed such discussions.|$|E
2500|$|The Tsang administration's {{relationship}} with the pan-democrats deteriorated after the pro-democrats' rejection of the constitutional reform package in December 2005. Bounded by {{the decision by the}} National People's Congress Standing Committee in 2004 which ruled out the 2007/2008 Chief Executive and Legislative Council universal suffrage, the Tsang administration put forward a reform package which would expand the 800-member Election Committee to 1,600 members and add 10 seats to the 2008 Legislative Council, with five directly-elected through geographical constituencies and five functional constituencies elected by District Councillors. The government claimed that this was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>deal</b> they could muster given the constraints of the NPCSC verdict.

2500|$|Revere's most {{personally}} challenging {{moment of}} his Civil War career came after the Battle of Chancellorsville when 'blame' was being assigned for the Union Army's loss. After charging the Confederate line, division commander Maj. Gen. Hiram Berry was mortally wounded and the command devolved on Revere. [...] In the chaos of a battle with no clear front line, Revere's decision to regroup his men, commanding them to reform at a point set by compass led to controversy. [...] This three-mile march, described by Revere as a [...] "regrouping effort" [...] and not a retreat, led to his being court-martialed. [...] Abraham Lincoln overturned the court's ruling and reinstated Revere but accepted Revere's resignation at the same time. As a lifelong member of the Democratic Party, that was probably <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>deal</b> Revere could expect from a Republican administration. In response to this situation, Revere was voted {{the honor of the}} rank of Brevet Major General by the United States Congress in 1866.|$|E
2500|$|Owain {{demonstrated}} his {{new status}} by negotiating the [...] "Tripartite Indenture" [...] in February 1405 with Edmund Mortimer and Henry Percy the 1st Earl of Northumberland. The Indenture agreed to divide England and Wales {{between the three}} of them. Wales would extend {{as far as the}} rivers Severn and Mersey including most of Cheshire, Shropshire, and Herefordshire. The Mortimer Lords of March would take all of southern and western England and Thomas Percy, 1st Earl of Worcester, would take the north of England. Local English communities in Shropshire, Herefordshire and Montgomeryshire had ceased active resistance and were making their own treaties with the rebels. It was rumoured that old allies of Richard II were sending money and arms to the Welsh and the Cistercians and Franciscans were funneling funds to support the rebellion. Furthermore, the Percy rebellion was still viable; even after the defeat of the Percy Archbishop Scrope in May. In fact the Percy rebellion was not to end until 1408 when the Sheriff of Yorkshire defeated Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland at Bramham Moor. Owain was capitalising on the political situation to make <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>deal</b> he possibly could.|$|E
2500|$|During his {{leave of}} absence, Romney {{continued}} to be listed in filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as [...] "sole shareholder, sole director, Chief Executive Officer and President".

[...] In practice, former Bain partners have stated that Romney's attention was mostly occupied by his Olympics position. [...] He did stay in regular contact with his partners, and traveled to meet with them several times, signing corporate and legal documents and paying attention to his own interests within the firm and to his departure negotiations. [...] Bain Capital Fund VI in 1998 {{was the last one}} Romney was involved in; investors were worried that with Romney gone, the firm would have trouble raising money for Bain Capital Fund VII in 2000, but in practice the $2.5 billion was raised without much trouble. His former partners have said that Romney had no role in assessing other new investments after February 1999, nor was he involved in directing the company’s investment funds. Discussions over the final terms of Romney's departure dragged on during this time, with Romney negotiating for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>deal</b> he could get and his continuing position as CEO and sole shareholder giving him the leverage to do so.|$|E
