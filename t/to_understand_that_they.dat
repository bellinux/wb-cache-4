No immigration checks would be performed on those affected. (Two weeks later, however, the government said that anyone coming forward {{would be subject to}} normal immigration rules, including the possibility of deportation, after twelve months.) May added that it was important for those receiving payments from the fund <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could keep the money – they would not have to pay it back, and it would not impact their entitlement to any other benefits.|$|E
25|$|Kelly was {{extremely}} disturbed {{that the media}} had identified {{his role in the}} matter and arranged with a family friend to leave his home and visit Cornwall with his wife. He was asked to appear as a witness before two committees of the House of Commons that were investigating the situation in Iraq and was further upset by the news that one of the appearances would be in public. He had been given a formal warning by the Ministry of Defence for an unauthorised meeting with a journalist and had been made <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might take more action if it turned out he had been lying to them.|$|E
25|$|If {{the goal}} of shorter-term therapy is for {{patients}} <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are not the way {{they appear to be}} and can act differently, then the longer-term goal of working through is for patients to understand who and what they are as human beings, what they truly are like and what they truly contain. The goal of working through is not achieved by the patient’s sudden discovery of a hidden, fully formed talented and creative self living inside, but is a process of slowly freeing oneself from the confinement of abandonment depression in order to uncover a potential. It is a process of experimentation with the spontaneous, nonreactive elements that can be experienced in relationship with others.|$|E

50|$|This {{song was}} written as a {{reaction}} of the attacks from neonazis on asylum-seeker houses in Mölln, Rostock-Lichtenhagen and Hoyerswerda. The press had seen some photos of the attackers, who wore Onkelz merchandise and wrote that the Onkelz were guilty for these attacks. The band wanted <b>to</b> make <b>understood,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> condemn such attacks.|$|R
25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, al-Husseini received a commission in the Ottoman Army as an artillery officer and {{was assigned to the}} Forty-Seventh Brigade stationed in and around the city of Izmir. In November 1916 he obtained a three-month disability leave from the army and returned to Jerusalem. He was recovering from an illness there when the city was captured by the British a year later. The British and Sherifian armies, for which some 500 Palestinian Arabs were estimated to have volunteered, completed their conquest of Ottoman-controlled Palestine and Syria in 1918. As a Sherifian officer, al-Husseini recruited men to serve in Faisal bin Al Hussein bin Ali El-Hashemi's army during the Arab Revolt, a task he undertook while employed as a recruiter by the British military administration in Jerusalem and Damascus. The post-war Palin Report noted that the English recruiting officer, Captain C. D. Brunton, found al-Husseini, with whom he cooperated, very pro-British, and that, via the diffusion of War Office pamphlets dropped from the air promising them peace and prosperity under British rule, 'the recruits (were) being given <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were fighting in a national cause and to liberate their country from the Turks'. Nothing in his early career to this point suggests he had ambitions to serve in a religious office: his interests were those of an Arab nationalist.|$|E
500|$|MacGregor persuaded Thomas Jenkins & Company {{to act as}} brokers for an £800,000 loan, {{issued on}} 20-year bonds at 3% interest, in mid-1827. The bonds, {{produced}} at nominal values of £250, £500 and £1,000, did not become popular. An anonymous handbill was circulated in the City of London, describing the previous Poyais loans and warning readers to [...] "Take Care of your Pockets—Another Poyais Humbug". The loan's poor performance compelled MacGregor to pass most of the unsold certificates to a consortium of speculators for a small sum. Sinclair stresses that the Poyais bonds were perceived as [...] "humbug" [...] not because MacGregor's hoax had been fully unravelled, but simply because the prior securities had failed to deliver profitable returns. [...] "Nobody thought to question the legitimacy of Poyais itself", he elaborates. [...] "Some investors had begun <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were being fleeced, but almost none realised how comprehensively." ...|$|E
500|$|In Freaks, {{director}} Tod Browning of Dracula fame helms {{a picture}} that depicts a traveling circus populated {{by a group of}} deformed carnival freaks. Browning populated the movie with actual carnival sideshow performers including [...] "midgets, dwarfs, hermaphrodites, Siamese twins, and, most awful, the armless and legless man billed as the 'living torso'". There is also a group of Pinheads, who are depicted as fortunate in that they are not mentally capable enough <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> disgust people. But the truly unsavory characters here are the villains, the circus strongman Hercules and the beautiful high-wire artist Cleopatra, who intends to marry and poison Hans, the midget heir who is enamored of her. At a dinner celebrating their union, one of the freaks dances on the table as they chant [...] "gooble-gobble, gobble, gobble, one of us, one of us, we accept her, we accept her." [...] Disgusted, Cleopatra insults Hans and makes out with Hercules in front of him. When the freaks discover her plot, they exact revenge by mutilating Cleopatra into a freak. Although, circus freaks were common in the early 1930s, the film was their first depiction on screen. Browning took care to linger over shots of the deformed, disabled performers with long takes of them including one of the [...] "living torso" [...] lighting a match and then a cigarette with his mouth. The film was accompanied by a sensational marketing campaign that asked sexual questions such as [...] "Do the Siamese Twins make love?", [...] "What sex is the half-man half-woman?", and [...] "Can a full grown woman truly love a midget?" [...] Surprisingly, given its reaction to Frankenstein, the state of Kansas objected to nothing in Freaks. However, other states, such as Georgia, were repulsed by the film and it was not shown in many locales. The film later became a cult classic spurred by midnight movie showings, but it was a box-office bomb in its original release.|$|E

2500|$|The {{writings}} of founder Ngeze {{in the journal}} regularly hinted at exterminations. [...] In issue 54, of March 1994, Ngeze stated that the RPF had a list of 1600 people who they would kill if they ever took power and warned [...] "the accomplices of the enemy are well known.

I sat down and played {{a little bit and}} they started laughing. I'd always had this {{reservation}} about my first encounter with top dog players and I thought they were rubbishing me, but with traditional black people communication always happens very slowly and that's how it was.

2500|$|Lee {{tried to}} hire an {{overseer}} to handle the plantation in his absence, writing to his cousin, [...] "I wish to get an energetic honest farmer, who while he will be considerate & kind to the negroes, will be firm & make them do their duty." [...] But Lee failed to find a man for the job, and {{had to take a}} two-year leave of absence from the army in order to run the plantation himself. He found the experience frustrating, since many of the slaves had been given <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were to be made free as soon as Custis died, and protested angrily at the delay. In May 1858, Lee wrote to his son Rooney, [...] "I have had some trouble with some of the people. Reuben, Parks & Edward, {{in the beginning of the}} previous week, rebelled against my authority—refused to obey my orders, & said they were as free as I was, etc., etc.—I succeeded in capturing them & lodging them in jail. They resisted till overpowered & called upon the other people to rescue them." [...] Less than two months after they were sent to the Alexandria jail, Lee decided to remove these three men and three female house slaves from Arlington, and sent them under lock and key to the slave-trader William Overton Winston in Richmond, who was instructed to keep them in jail until he could find [...] "good & responsible" [...] slaveholders to work them until the end of the five-year period.|$|E

50|$|Fragmentation {{is related}} to Arnold Schoenberg's concept of liquidation, a common {{compositional}} technique that describes the reduction of a large-scale musical idea to its essential form (such as a contour line, a specific harmonic motion, or the like). Liquidation shapes much thematically-driven music, such as that by Béla Bartók, Stravinsky, and Schoenberg himself. It is important <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that,</b> although <b>they</b> are related, fragmentation and liquidation are separate processes and concepts.|$|R

2500|$|Additionally, in Disciplining {{investment}} Bankers, Disciplining the Economy: Wall Street's Institutional Culture of Crisis and the Downsizing of [...] "Corporate America", Karen Ho {{states that}} {{as we continue to}} learn more about Wall Street, we learn about each independent banker. As the banker brings their life experiences into the business, we can see the reasons for their actions. Each investor has a unique identity which contributes to the culture of Wall Street. Ideally, they live in the moment. [...] However, job insecurity and the volatile nature of the market creates a constant state of fear within the investor. Therefore, they must organize themselves and follow a pattern to ensure security, profit and prosperity for the long run. Karen Ho wishes for us to see Wall Street through the lens of the everyday investor and banker, as well as understand the experiences and everyday situations that they must endure. Ho also believes that the individuals within the public can counteract the stereotypes and negativity that both the media and society associates with Wall Street by learning more about the personal experiences of the investors and their everyday lives. Similarly to regular wage earners, Wall Street employees are just trying to earn a day's pay. Their work is sometimes undervalued, because the public does not see them in this manner. Thus, Wall Street cannot be understood in black and white terms. One needs <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have a value system which is not only logical to them, but also reflective of North America's values of individual power, prestige, and social practices based on individualism. For example, throughout the 1940s and into the 1950s Manhattan was a [...] "white-only" [...] community. [...] Within that time period, {{there was a lot of}} racial segregation. The values of America and the social practices were not like they are today, so African Americans were not within the Wall Street community.|$|E
