5|$|At {{the time}} of Innocent VIII's death, the names of Cardinals Gherardo and Sanseverino (both created in pectore), had not been published, thus making them ineligible to {{participate}} in the conclave; however, both were published as an act of the College in sede vacante, Gherardo having been pushed by Giovanni Battista Orsini and Sanseverino by Ascanio Sforza. Gherardo was assigned the title of Santi Nereo e Achilleo, which it was believed Innocent VIII had intended for him; Sanseverino was given <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>and</b> undesirable diaconate of San Teodoro to ensure that the future pontiff would confirm his assignment.|$|E

5|$|From 10 July 1925 {{to the end}} of his life, Meher Baba {{maintained}} silence, communicating {{by means}} of an alphabet board or by unique hand gestures.

5|$|In {{the first}} chapter of Palmetto Leaves, Stowe tells how she takes a steamer to Savannah, Georgia. On board is a stray dog who begs scraps of food and affection from the passengers. It finally becomes {{attached}} to a woman on board and follows her around. At Savannah, the dog is thrown into the street by the porters and waiters at the hotel, and is eventually left behind. Stowe compares the dog and the people who care for such stray animals to Christian ideals to take care of <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>and</b> suffering.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also from}} the Neolithic, in about 3000 BC, that we glimpse the first known {{illustrations}} of plants and read descriptions of impressive gardens in Egypt. However protobotany, the first pre-scientific written record of plants, did not begin with food; it {{was born out of}} the medicinal literature of Egypt, China, Mesopotamia and India. Botanical historian Alan Morton notes that agriculture was the occupation of <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>and</b> uneducated, while medicine was the realm of socially influential shamans, priests, apothecaries, magicians and physicians, who were more likely to record their knowledge for posterity.|$|E

5|$|John Baldwin was {{a person}} whose views seemed {{to run counter to}} the {{conventional}} customs of the time. Despite his accomplishments, he never wrote a book, held public office, or even kept books. Although he was not an abolitionist by definition, he had no problem teaching blacks and whites as equals, as evident by his opening Baldwin Institute without regard to race or gender. His parents taught him to fear God, and he consequently devoted himself to living humbly and righteously, to being kind to <b>the</b> <b>poor,</b> <b>and</b> to joining the Methodist Church.|$|E
5|$|Pope Francis, {{the current}} pope of the Catholic Church, succeeded Pope Benedict XVI in 2013 {{as the first}} pope from the Americas, the first from the Southern Hemisphere and the first Pope from outside Europe since the Syrian Gregory III, who reigned in the 8th century. Pope Francis has been noted for his humility, {{emphasis}} on God's mercy, concern for <b>the</b> <b>poor,</b> <b>and</b> the environment, {{as well as his}} commitment to interfaith dialogue. He is credited with having a less formal approach to the papacy than his predecessors.|$|E

He preached in the open air to miners and brickworkers in Kingswood and Hanham.|$|E

5|$|The chapter {{asserts that}} the king should be truthful, avoid anger, be virtuous and lead by example.

5|$|The {{main unit}} of local {{government}} was the parish, and since it was {{also part of the}} church, the elders imposed public humiliation for what the locals considered immoral behaviour, including fornication, drunkenness, wife beating, cursing and Sabbath breaking.
