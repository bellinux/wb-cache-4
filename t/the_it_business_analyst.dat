40|$|This thesis aims at {{empowering}} software {{customers with}} {{a tool to}} build software tests them selves, based on a gradual refinement of natural language scenarios into executable visual test models. The process is divided in five steps: 1. First, a natural language parser is used to extract a graph of grammatical relations from the textual scenario descriptions. 2. The resulting graph is transformed into an informal story pattern by interpreting structurization rules based on Fujaba Story Diagrams. 3. While the informal story pattern can already be used by humans the diagram still lacks technical details, especially type information. To add them, a recommender based framework uses web sites and other resources to generate formalization rules. 4. As a preparation for the code generation the classes derived for formal story patterns are aligned across all story steps, substituting a class diagram. 5. Finally, a headless version of Fujaba is used to generate an executable JUnit test. The graph transformations used in the browser application are specified in a textual domain specific language and visualized as story pattern. Last but not least, only the heavyweight parsing (step 1) and code generation (step 5) are executed on the server side. All graph transformation steps (2, 3 and 4) are executed in the browser by an interpreter written in JavaScript/GWT. This result paves the way for online collaboration between global teams of software customers, <b>IT</b> <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> and software developers...|$|R
40|$|To date, one of {{the common}} {{problems}} e-business and e-service want to solve is how to use their large volumes of sales histories, web transactions, and information resource data to know their customers’ behavior. They want to understand their customers to develop long-term relationships and to improve service quality. Many data analysis methods use bar charts which only show highly aggregated data and lose most of the detail information due to data aggregation. This paper discusses the integration of a recent pixel bar chart technique that does not lose information into a visual data mining system.

40|$|To {{develop a}} better {{understanding}} of the practice of business and systems analysis, we adopted the boundary practice lens to view business analysis as a boundary practice between users and IT staff. This paper presents findings from an interpretive case study of a group of <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> working within a large public sector university. We find that <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> are largely expected to ‘protect’ <b>the</b> users and <b>IT</b> staff from each other. The business analysts’ location in the organisation structure and previous work experience in <b>business</b> or <b>IT</b> is likely to influence (a) the focus of their work (b) the closeness and trust developed with users and IT staff and (c) their legitimacy in spanning users and IT staff. To be able to bring about agreed requirements specifications that are both technically possible to realise and can be delivered at an acceptable cost, but also will result in a system that is suitable for the business purpose and easy to use, <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> need to negotiate a middle path between users and <b>IT</b> staff. Because <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> need to work effectively with <b>IT</b> and <b>the</b> <b>business</b> and move easily between the respective cultures, learning outcomes in the education of BAs need to emphasise (a) dealing with social and political context of both business requirements and technical/economic feasibility and (b) using distinct skills, knowledge, tools, and techniques in dealing with users and IT...|$|R

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Doctor of Technology: Information Technology in the Faculty of Informatics and Design at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology 2013 The alignment between business and information technology (IT) strategies has been a challenge for many years. Strategic alignment models and enterprise architecture methodologies and frameworks {{have been developed to}} assist <b>business</b> and <b>IT</b> managers with improving alignment between <b>business</b> and <b>IT</b> strategies. <b>The</b> <b>business</b> <b>analyst,</b> systems analyst and project manager are key role players in delivering the information systems (IS) needs of business and therefore key in aligning <b>business</b> and <b>IT</b> strategies. Despite literature and research suggesting a positive influence of emotional intelligence on occupational performance in various industries, the development of emotional intelligence of the <b>business</b> <b>analyst,</b> systems analyst and project manager is neglected by software development organisations. Emotional intelligence is neglected in industry IS competency models as well as documented standards for the business analysis and project management profession (BABOK and PMBOK). Emotional intelligence is not addressed in strategic alignment models and enterprise architecture methodologies and frameworks. Emotional intelligence is equally neglected in IS literature. Systematic research investigating the impact of emotional intelligence on occupational performance of IT professionals remains sparse. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine which emotional intelligence competencies are needed to improve the occupational performance of <b>business</b> <b>analysts,</b> systems analysts and project managers in delivering business information system needs. The study took the form of a multiple interpretive case study. Qualitative data was collected using semi-structured interviews with stakeholders from 20 software development organisations utilising the roles of the <b>business</b> <b>analyst,</b> systems analyst and project manager. Quantitative data was collected using the Genos Emotional Intelligence Inventory with the aim of identifying the patterns of emotional intelligence visible in the sample of <b>business</b> <b>analysts,</b> systems analysts and project managers assessed. The study suggests emotional intelligence has a role to play in alignment between <b>business</b> and <b>IT</b> strategies. It is proposed that industry IS competency models as well as the standards for the business analysis and project management profession as documented in BABOK and PMBOK include specific emotional intelligence competencies. The study also proposes that higher education institutions in IT/IS such as universities of technology, as well as training providers focusing on business analysis, systems analysis and project management, should focus not only on technical skills but emotional intelligence skills as well when developing the supply pipeline of <b>business</b> <b>analysts,</b> systems analysts and project managers.

40|$|Drawing on the resource-based {{view and}} the {{literature}} on big data analytics (BDA), information system (IS) success and the business value of information technology (IT), this study proposes a big data analytics capability (BDAC) model.

The findings confirm the value of the entanglement conceptualization of the hierarchical BDAC model, which has both direct and indirect impacts on FPER.
