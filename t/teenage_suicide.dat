Fisher disputed this, saying that in all their legal dealings, none had ever led to a <b>teenage</b> <b>suicide.</b> Initially Fisher offered amnesty to internet users who came forward and admitted they downloaded content illegally. They could settle with Fisher by paying a one time $1000 fee. Fisher described the people who downloaded the content as thieves. The suit also claims that any reasonable internet user would secure their router {{and those who did}} not and allowed content to be downloaded through their IP address were also guilty of copyright infringement. Fisher also sued a Swedish man who wrote a satirical email to them, admitting he had downloaded Fisher's content but told him the money would be paid out of a pot of gold he received from a leprechaun at the end of the rainbow.

500|$|Kneale's concept {{concerned}} [...] "the {{world of}} the future, {{and a way of}} keeping the population happy without being active". According to Kneale, the notion for the play came from the [...] "worldwide dread of populations exploding out of all control" [...] leading him to devise a world where pornography hooks the population [...] "on a substitute for sex rather than the real thing and so keeping the population down". Kneale was also influenced by the dropout counterculture of the late 1960s, recalling [...] "I didn't like the Sixties at all because of the whole thing of 'let it all hang out' and let's stop thinking [...] which was the all too frequent theme of the Sixties which I hated". Dissatisfaction with the youth culture of the time was a preoccupation of Kneale's—in the mid-sixties he had worked on The Big, Big, Giggle, an unmade script about a <b>teenage</b> <b>suicide</b> cult, and following The Year of the Sex Olympics he returned to the theme of youth out of control in his 1969 play Bam! Pow! Zapp!, and in the fourth and final Quatermass serial in 1979. Many cultural icons of the youth movement, including members of The Beatles, Pink Floyd and Monty Python, were fans of Kneale's work. For The Year of the Sex Olympics Kneale extrapolated the possible consequences of the youth movement's desire for freedom from [...] "traditional" [...] cultural inhibitions, asking as the academic John R. Cook puts it, [...] "In a world of no limits, will the result quickly be apathy if there is nothing any more to get excited about, nothing precious or illicit to fight for in the teeth of the censor?".|$|E
500|$|Kneale {{began writing}} the scripts, working to a {{delivery}} deadline of February 1973. Much {{of the setting}} for the story was influenced by contemporary political events such as strikes, power cuts, the Oil Crisis and developments in the Space Race, especially the planned Apollo-Soyuz missions and Skylab. Writing in the listings magazine TV Times to promote the serial, Kneale said, [...] "Quatermass {{is a story of}} the future – but perhaps only a few years from now. There are some clues already in the most obvious places: the streets. Pavements littered with rubbish. Walls painted with angry graffiti. Belfast black with smoke and rage. Worst of all, the mindless violence". Concerns about the state of society, especially the [...] "dropout" [...] culture of the youth movement, had been a theme of Kneale's writing for some time. This was seen in such works as The Big, Big Giggle, an unmade play about a <b>teenage</b> <b>suicide</b> cult; The Year of the Sex Olympics, about the consequences of a world with no censorship or inhibitions; and Bam! Pow! Zap! (1969), about teenage delinquents, all of which fed into the world depicted in the new Quatermass serial. Kneale said, [...] "I looked at the alarming aspects of contemporary trends. Since then, we'd seen 'flower power' and hippies, so all I did was bring them into the story. It was written in 1972 and it was about the sixties really". Another theme that had crept into Kneale's writing at this time—as seen in Wine of India, about compulsory euthanasia for the elderly, and later the Beasts episode [...] "During Barty's Party", about an elderly couple terrorised by rats—was the consequences of growing old. Kneale later recalled, [...] "The theme I was trying to get to was the old redressing the balance with the young, saving the young, which I thought a nice, paradoxical, ironic idea after the youth-oriented 60s".|$|E
