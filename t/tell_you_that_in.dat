25|$|I must <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Mauritania, {{freedom is}} total: freedom of thought, {{equality}} – {{of all men}} and women of Mauritania... in all cases, especially with this government, this is in the past. There are probably former relationships – slavery relationships and familial relationships from old days and of the older generations, maybe, or descendants who wish to continue to be in relationships with descendants of their old masters, for familial reasons, or out of affinity, and maybe also for economic interests. But (slavery) is something that is totally finished. All people are free in Mauritania and this phenomenon no longer exists. And I believe that I can tell you that no one profits from this commerce.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have seen}} Jake as an {{ambiguous}} representative of Hemingway manliness. For example, {{in the bar}} scene in Paris, Jake is angry at some homosexual men. The critic Ira Elliot suggests that Hemingway viewed homosexuality as an inauthentic way of life, and that he aligns Jake with homosexual men because, like them, Jake does not have sex with women. Jake's anger shows his self-hatred at his inauthenticity and lack of masculinity. His sense of masculine identity is lost—he {{is less than a}} man. Elliot wonders if Jake's wound perhaps signifies latent homosexuality, rather than only a loss of masculinity; the emphasis in the novel, however, is on Jake's interest in women. Hemingway's writing has been called homophobic because of the language his characters use. For example, in the fishing scenes, Bill confesses his fondness for Jake but then goes on to say, [...] "I couldn't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> New York. It'd mean I was a faggot." ...|$|E
