6000|$|The supper was finished, the <b>table</b> <b>cleared,</b> the {{stranger}} did not go. Two {{of the young}} soldiers went off to bed, with their cheery: ...|$|R
60|$|David {{had only}} just got the <b>table</b> <b>clear,</b> and set the plates in a row under the bakehouse table for the cats to lick, when the door was hastily opened, and Mrs. Garland came in, looking concerned.|$|R
60|$|Dinner was over, and the <b>table</b> <b>cleared</b> before Holmes {{alluded to}} the matter again. He had lit his pipe and held his slippered feet to the cheerful blaze of the fire. Suddenly {{he looked at his}} watch.|$|R
60|$|To rise again, {{gasping for}} air--for the fall had shaken him--was {{the work of}} an instant. But in that instant Fortunio had thrust the <b>table</b> <b>clear</b> of the doorway, and his men were pouring into the room.|$|R
60|$|The {{conversation}} was desultory throughout the repast; {{but when the}} cloth was raised and the <b>table</b> <b>cleared</b> of all but the dishes of fruit and the decanters of Oporto, Canary and Madeira, there came a moment of expansion.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} they would make you sick, amongst them," [...] said his mother. [...] "Are {{you going to have}} {{anything}} more to eat?" [...] she asked, with a housekeeper's latent impatience to get her <b>table</b> <b>cleared</b> away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Get the <b>table</b> <b>cleared</b> {{as soon as}} you can, Mercy, {{and bring}} two flasks of that last batch of Spanish wine out of the cellar, and put them and some cups on the board. I have two or three friends coming in, to talk over a matter of {{business}} with Reuben and me." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{found the}} <b>table</b> <b>clear</b> {{and a bowl}} of flowers placed in the exact centre. On {{opposite}} sides of the room, each with her hands folded in her lap, and both sitting bolt upright, Mrs. Willett and Mrs. Chinnery confronted each other. With a muttered reference to his ship, the captain took up his stick and fled.|$|R
60|$|The tin mugs {{were all}} taken away and washed when the <b>table</b> was <b>cleared.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Captain Fazackerly {{advanced}} to the <b>table,</b> and <b>clearing</b> his throat, fixed his eyes in a reflective stare {{on the opposite wall}} and commenced:— ...|$|R
6000|$|The tea-things {{were soon}} cleared away, {{and we took}} our seats round the fire. For {{although}} the weather was not actually cold, we usually had {{a fire in the}} evening, as, indeed, by the seaside one can do almost all the year round with comfort. Papa sat on one side, I on a stool by him, Harry next, and Mr. Petersfield on the other side. As soon as the cigars and pipe were fairly alight, the <b>table</b> <b>cleared,</b> and we alone, papa began,-- ...|$|R
60|$|September 2.--This was a {{very warm}} day. I {{remained}} at home, chiefly engaged in arranging papers, as I go away to-morrow. It is lucky these starts happen {{from time to time}} as I should otherwise never get my <b>table</b> <b>clear.</b> At five o'clock the air became cooler, and I sat out of doors and played with the children. Anne, who had been at Mertoun the day before, brought up Anne and Elizabeth Scott[33] with her, and Francis has been with us since yesterday. Richardson left us.|$|R
60|$|When all was ready--the <b>table</b> <b>cleared</b> of {{everything}} except what pertained to the literary work then in hand--Stephen Gaff {{sat down at}} one end of the table; his wife drew her chair to the other end; Tottie, feeling very proud and rather nervous, sat between them, with a new quill in her hand, and a spotless sheet of foolscap before her. The Bu'ster stood by with the blot-sheet, looking eager, as if he rather wished for blots, and was prepared to swab them up without delay.|$|R
60|$|When {{the meal}} was {{finished}} and the <b>table</b> <b>cleared,</b> the king retired to sleep, and Renzolla drew the shoes from his feet, {{at the same time}} drawing his heart from his breast. So desperately had he fallen in love with her, that he called the fairy to him, and asked her for Renzolla's hand in marriage. As the kind fairy had only the girl's welfare at heart, she willingly gave her consent, and not her consent only, but a wedding portion of seven thousand golden guineas.|$|R
60|$|Although {{near the}} end of the feast and with only debris left to manipulate, he managed to refresh himself to his entire {{satisfaction}} before the <b>tables</b> were <b>cleared.</b>|$|R
60|$|Gentlemen {{and ladies}} at the hotels, in London, {{generally}} dine {{about six or}} seven o'clock, each party or family by themselves, in their own private parlor. One evening, about eight o'clock, just after the waiter had removed the cloth from the table where Rollo's father and mother, with Rollo himself and his cousin Jennie, had been dining, and left the <b>table</b> <b>clear,</b> Mr. Holiday rose, and walked slowly and feebly--for he was quite out of health, though much better than he had been--towards a secretary which stood {{at the side of the}} room.|$|R
50|$|The idea of banqueting is ancient (see Sellisternium, Belshazzar's Feast, and Mead halls). In the 16th century, {{a banquet}} was very {{different}} from our modern perception and stems from the medieval 'ceremony of the void'. After dinner, the guests would stand and drink sweet wine and spices while the <b>table</b> was <b>cleared,</b> or ‘voided’. (Later in the 17th century ‘void’ would be replaced with the French ‘dessert’.) During the 16th century, guests would no longer stand in the great chamber whilst the <b>table</b> was <b>cleared</b> and the room prepared for entertainment, but would retire to the parlour or banqueting room.|$|R
60|$|But it {{appeared}} {{we were at}} the end of discoveries for the day; and we left the brig about sundown, without being further puzzled or further enlightened. The best of the cabin spoils--books, instruments, papers, silks, and curiosities--we carried along with us in a blanket, however, to divert the evening hours; and when supper was over, and the <b>table</b> <b>cleared,</b> and Johnson set down to a dreary game of cribbage between his right hand and his left, the captain and I turned out our blanket on the floor, and sat side by side to examine and appraise the spoils.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{some other}} early public {{relations}} practitioners, Bernays advocated centralization and planning. Marvin Olasky calls his 1945 book Take Your Place at the Peace <b>Table</b> “a <b>clear</b> appeal for {{a form of}} mild corporate socialism.” ...|$|R
60|$|The dinner {{over and}} <b>tables</b> <b>cleared,</b> {{the men and}} youths {{disposed}} themselves on the benches and chairs and on their spread ponchos on the ground, and started smoking and conversing. A guitar was produced, and Barboza being present, surrounded as usual by a crowd of his particular friends or parasites, all eagerly listening to his talk and applauding his sallies with bursts of laughter, he was naturally first asked to sing. The accompanist {{in this case was}} Goyo Montes, a little thick-set gaucho with round staring blue eyes set in a round pinky- brown face, and the tune agreed on was one known as La Lechera--the Milkmaid.|$|R
60|$|The <b>table</b> {{was then}} <b>cleared</b> of the articles, {{and the men}} began to drink.|$|R
50|$|When the <b>table</b> is <b>cleared</b> in {{response}} to a clear code, both encoder and decoder change the code width after the clear code back to the initial code width, starting with the code immediately following the clear code.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} make Appendix <b>Table</b> 7 <b>clearer,</b> we used video {{resolution}} instead of the tag Image Size, {{and we did not}} report the tags related to the audio acquisition, although they will be described in the following paragraphs.|$|R
60|$|The mate in {{a melancholy}} voice thanked her, {{and to the}} great {{annoyance}} of the cook, who had received strict orders from the forecastle to listen {{as much as he}} could, sat in silence while the <b>table</b> was <b>cleared.</b>|$|R

50|$|Inside, Lily asks Robin {{how things}} are going with Gael and Robin reveals she has become annoyed doing things at home that she loved on holiday, such as being hand-fed her food by Gael (dropping {{spaghetti}} on her sofa) and him sweeping the <b>table</b> <b>clear</b> to make love to her (breaking her laptop). Robin says she won't complain and go with the flow. However, when she is in the shower later, someone uses her toilet and, initially thinking it is Gael, she is shocked to discover it is actually a strange Australian backpacker (Damon Gameau). Robin goes to speak to Gael, but discovers he has invited the backpacker and his friends to stay with them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, lad," [...] the old sailor said, {{somewhat}} surprised. [...] "We {{shall be}} quiet enough here, {{as soon as}} the <b>table</b> is <b>cleared.</b> My dame and Nellie will be helping the maid do up the cabins, and will then be sallying out marketing." ...|$|R
60|$|When he {{got home}} he hurried upstairs to his bare chamber. He swept his <b>table</b> <b>clear,</b> and then, in an expert fashion, he seized handfuls of coin and piled them in little columns on his board. There was an army of fat pennies, a dozen to a column, along the back, {{rows and rows of}} fat brown rank-and-file. In front of these, rows of slim halfpence, like an advance-guard. And {{commanding}} all, a stout column of half-crowns, a few stoutish and important florin-figures, like general and colonels, then quite a file of shillings, like so many captains, and a little cloud of silvery lieutenant sixpences. Right at the end, like a frail drummer boy, a thin stick of threepenny pieces.|$|R
60|$|Morel and Paul went, with a candle, {{into the}} parlour. There was no gas there. The father {{unscrewed}} {{the top of}} the big mahogany oval <b>table,</b> and <b>cleared</b> the middle of the room; then he arranged six chairs opposite each other, so that the coffin could stand on their beds.|$|R

6000|$|After that, the confetti on the <b>table</b> was <b>cleared</b> {{away and}} they ate their lunch amid a {{constant}} cracking of jokes and bright sayings. Songbird {{woke up and}} recited some verses {{he said he had}} composed the night before, while lying awake in his berth. Some of these ran in this fashion: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{please let}} me tell you all about myself, for I am afraid you think me {{something}} better than I am. If I ask help from you, it is right that you should know whom you are helping," [...] said Christie, when the <b>table</b> was <b>cleared</b> and her hostess came and sat down beside her.|$|R
