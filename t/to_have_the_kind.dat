He said that he wanted the casting choices to convey the alien species as [...] "young, angry people who never lived old enough <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of experience and perspective on the world that, say, the Klingons and Romulans might have". He wanted to emphasize that the Kazon were [...] "much more emotional, short fused, and therefore had fewer expectations" [...] through the actors' performances. The roles, however, were filled by actors outside this age range, with Piller explaining that the decision was reached {{on the grounds that the}} [...] "older actors gave more polished performances". He later regretted the choice of more mature actors, as he felt this conflicted with the writers' concept of the species, making them appear too much like Klingons. The Kazon also received comparisons to the Cardassians and Wood Elves by Uproxx's Donna Dickens.|$|E

The pairing of Reese and Bianca finally allowed the character to be scripted into an on-screen committed relationship. The show had been criticized {{in the past for}} not giving Bianca a full-fledged on-screen romance. When asked by The Advocate if she felt Bianca's pairing with Reese, especially by bringing on a recognized name (Braun), would make a difference, Riegel replied, [...] "I think {{there has to be a}} difference." [...] She responded to the criticism about Bianca's lack of onscreen intimacy with past romantic partners. [...] "I don’t know if the criticism is entirely warranted," [...] she said. [...] "I know I was glad that the show’s priority was in giving me good stories, and I thought that they did go further than anyone else had ever gone, so I always thought that they should be commended." [...] Riegel added, however, that she knows the lack of onscreen intimacy between Bianca and the character's past romantic love interests left fans and herself unsatisfied. [...] "She never really got <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of relationship that she deserved," [...] stated Riegel.

50|$|Discovery of echinocandins {{stemmed from}} studies on papulacandins {{isolated}} from {{a strain of}} Papularia sphaerosperma (Pers.), which were liposaccharide - i.e., fatty acid derivatives of a disaccharide that also blocked the same target, 1,3-β glucan synthase - and had action only on Candida spp. (narrow spectrum). Screening of natural products of fungal fermentation in the 1970s led {{to the discovery of}} echinocandins, a new group of antifungals with broad-range activity against Candida spp. One of the first echinocandins of the pneumocandin type, discovered in 1974, echinocandin B, could not be used clinically due to risk of high degree of hemolysis. Screening semisynthetic analogs of the echinocandins gave rise to cilofungin, the first echinofungin analog to enter clinical trials, in 1980, which, it is presumed, was later withdrawn for a toxicity due to the solvent system needed for systemic administration. The semisynthetic pneumocandin analogs of echinocandins were later found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same <b>kind</b> of antifungal activity, but low toxicity. The first approved of these newer echinocandins was caspofungin, and later micafungin and anidulafungin were also approved. All these preparations so far have low oral bioavailability, so must be given intravenously only. Echinocandins have now become one of the first-line treatments for Candida before the species are identified, and even as antifungal prophylaxis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients.|$|R

40|$|Why did Shakespeare write 'shak’d' {{when we say}} 'shook'? Why do {{some people}} say 'dived' and others 'dove'? These {{questions}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do with how we inflect verbs for past tense, and how those strategies vary across time and space. This dissertation sheds light on the issue through case studies of verbs in Swedish and Frisian, and by using analogy (structural similarity) {{as a way of}} explaining language change. In {{the first half of the}} book the development of verbal inflection in the Germanic languages is treated, along with more detailed histories of that inflection in Swedish and Frisian. The second part is dedicated to analogy. The hypothesis is that verbs that sound alike will tend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same <b>kind</b> of past tense inflection as well. After an introduction of the concept of analogy, it is applied to the data described in the first half of the book. Using two analogical computer models, changes from the history of Swedish and Frisian are recreated, and the successes and failures of the models show how well analogy can explain inflection class changes in these languages. In addition, the analogical modelling findings are related to frequency, leading to the conclusion that analogy and frequency together determine patterns of stability and shift in verbal inflection classes. Finally, the two appendices of this dissertation contain historical mini-dictionaries of verbs with strong inflection in the Germanic languages...|$|R

For the most part, the Kant of the first Critique tends to assume that experience, and the knowledge {{that is based on}} it, is unproblematic.

At the same time, however, the notion of experience plays {{a crucial role in the}} central arguments of the Critique. For, again as most readers of the Critique know, Kant aims to show how we can have synthetic a priori knowledge by showing that the categories, or pure concepts of the understanding, are conditions of the possibility of experience.
