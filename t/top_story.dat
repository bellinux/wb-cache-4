25|$|An {{important}} building, the Palazzo Branconio dell'Aquila for Leo's Papal Chamberlain Giovanni Battista Branconio, {{was completely}} destroyed {{to make way}} for Bernini's piazza for St. Peter's, but drawings of the façade and courtyard remain. The façade was an unusually richly decorated one for the period, including both painted panels on the <b>top</b> <b>story</b> (of three), and much sculpture on the middle one.|$|E
25|$|The October 26, 1929, {{edition of}} the Rhinebeck Gazette {{describes}} bins found in the <b>top</b> <b>story</b> or garret of the house. These were traditionally used to store grain {{out of the reach}} of pilfering Indians. However, there are more practical reasons that local grain was stored in the garret of the house. It was more secure from rodents in the barn and would have been a dryer atmosphere, because even when heat was not required, a fire for cooking was always burning in the fireplace.|$|E
25|$|Its {{exterior}} {{was left}} unchanged from its completion in 1973, through the 1999 merger with Mercantile Bancorporation. At that time, Firstar announced that signs would {{be attached to}} the top of the building. Critics argued the green advertising signs on all four sides of the building's <b>top</b> <b>story,</b> in place of the original aluminum elements that were subsequently recycled, disrupted the look of the building's signature diagonal trusses. The signs were replaced with opaque, white ones by 2002, to reflect the merger with U.S. Bancorp.|$|E

25|$|The {{two towers}} contain {{identical}} floor plans. The bottom 19 floors form an exposed spiral parking ramp operated by valet with approximately 896 parking spaces. The 20th floor of each contains a laundry room and gym with panoramic {{views of the}} Loop, while floors 21 through 60 contain apartments (450 per tower). A 360-degree open-air roof deck lies on the 61st and <b>top</b> <b>story.</b> The buildings are accessed from separate lobbies that share a common below-grade mezzanine level as well as ground-level plaza entrances beside the House of Blues. Originally rental apartments, the complex converted to condominiums in 1977, but still contains a number of rental units.|$|E
25|$|The minaret is {{situated}} at the southern corner of the facade looking into Bab al-Wazir Street, affording a dominant view of the entire {{southern part of the}} street. It consists of three stories, the first being circular and plain and the second circular and ribbed while the <b>top</b> <b>story</b> is a bulb resting on a pavilion supported by eight slender stone columns. Its circular shaft is rare among Mamluk minarets. Prior to its 20th-century restoration, the minaret had four stories. The third story was octagonal and removed during the restoration, depriving the Aqsunqur Mosque a unique feature it shared with another mosque in Cairo, the Sultan al-Ghuri Complex which has four stories. The Aqsunqur Mosque minaret was featured in several 19th-century illustrations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{describe}} {{the participation of}} the University of Amsterdam’s ILPS group in the blog track at TREC 2009. We focus on the <b>top</b> <b>stories</b> identification task, and take an approach that does not require the headlines of <b>top</b> <b>stories</b> to be known beforehand. We explore the feasibility of a so-called blogs to news approach: given a date and a set of blog posts, identify the main topics for that date. This approach is more general than just finding <b>top</b> <b>stories,</b> but it can still be applied to the task of headline ranking. Results show that this general approach, applied to the task at hand, is among the top performing approaches in this year’s TREC. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{expansion}} of the forecastle in the early 15th century marked the third phase of Trakai's development. The walls of the forecastle were strengthened to a thickness of 2.5 metres and raised with additional firing galleries. Three major defensive towers were constructed on the corners. The southwestern tower was also used as a prison. The <b>top</b> <b>story</b> of the towers was designed for soldiers and housed {{a large number of}} cannons. A main gatehouse was also constructed which, along with the Ducal Palace donjon, had movable gates. The gatehouse was reinforced with additional sections for firing galleries. Near the inner walls several buildings were constructed, including stables, kitchens, and other support structures. When the castle was undergoing this expansion in the 15th century, the water level of Lake Galvė was several metres higher than it is today. The castle builders took advantage of this by separating the Ducal Palace and the forecastle with a moat, just wide enough for small boats to sail through. They were connected by gates that could be raised in case of an enemy attack.|$|E

500|$|As {{originally}} planned, {{the tower}} would have 60 stories consisting of 13 office floors, 40 condominium floors, and 2 floors for mechanical uses, {{but this was}} later amended. However, in the final plan, the 58-story building contained six floors for the atrium, then thirteen office floors {{on top of the}} atrium, and finally 39 condominium floors above the offices. Originally, it was estimated that it would take $100 million to construct the tower. When the tower eventually opened, it had 58 stories, with the <b>top</b> <b>story</b> marked as [...] "68" [...] because, according to Trump, the five-story-tall public atrium occupies the height of 10 ordinary stories. However, several Bloomberg L.P. writers determined that Trump's calculations did not account {{for the fact that the}} ceiling heights in Trump Tower were much taller than in comparable buildings. As a result of this miscalculation, the tower does not have any floors numbered 6–13.|$|E
500|$|In July 1989, {{the embassy}} was {{relocated}} to a new, [...] compound along Afgoy Road {{in the local}} K-7 district. The grounds consisted of the Chancery, the Joint Administrative Office (JAO), Marine House (for the Marine Security Guards), the ambassador's residence, a building for the United States Information Service, an American school, a recreational complex for the local expatriate community, a [...] water tower, and various storage and maintenance buildings. The recreational complex, which comprised {{about half of the}} compound, included a pool, tennis courts, and a golf course. Outside the walled embassy, the US maintained the K-7 complex, an apartment complex for embassy staff located across Afgoy Road, as well as the Office for Military Cooperation. Both were situated one and a half blocks from the embassy proper. The ambassador's residence was largely constructed in glass, had no protective barriers, and its <b>top</b> <b>story</b> overlooked the embassy's walls. Ambassador Bishop therefore ordered that some bars be installed across the glass as an additional security protective measure.|$|E
500|$|The episode's airing—in particular, its shock regeneration—contributed to {{a public}} surge of interest, {{described}} by Daily Mail journalist Paul Revoir as [...] "Doctor Who fever". The regeneration prompted {{a large amount of}} speculation to Tennant's replacement: actor Robert Carlyle was the bookmaker's favourite to replace Tennant; and actors James McAvoy, Jason Statham, Alan Davies, and James Nesbitt were less popular predictions. In his article about the public reaction to the cliffhanger, Revoir offered five popular theories: a botched regeneration that resulted in two Doctors; a revelation that the whole series was dream sequence like the ninth season of Dallas; Tennant's successor being female; a normal regeneration; and a cover-up by the BBC to disguise the fact that [...] "Journey's End" [...] would be Tennant's last appearance; the first theory proved to be correct. The increase of public interest peaked in the two days prior to the transmission of [...] "Journey's End": the day before transmission saw the Seventh Doctor's actor Sylvester McCoy, Collinson, Davies, and Agyeman appear on separate daytime television shows; and coverage of the series finale was the <b>top</b> <b>story</b> in BBC News Online's entertainment section several hours before transmission. Davies attributed the amount of interest the episode created—which was greater than he expected—and the success of the new series to the measures made in keeping plot details secret and creating a [...] "live experience": ...|$|E
