40|$|Policies incentivizing {{the private}} sector to reach its {{innovative}} potential in “clean” technologies are likely to {{play a key role in}} achieving climate stabilization. This article explores the relationship between innovation and cap-and-trade programs (CTPs) —the world's most prominent climate policy instrument—through empirical evidence drawn from successful CTPs for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide control. The article shows that before trading began for these CTPs, analysts overestimated the value of allowances in a pattern suggestive of the frequent a priori overestimation of the compliance costs of regulation. When lower-than-expected allowance prices were observed, in part because of the unexpected range of abatement approaches used in the lead-up to trading, emissions sources chose to bank allowances in significant numbers and reassess abatement approaches going forward. In addition, commercially oriented inventive activity declined for emissions-reducing technologies with a wide range of costs and <b>technical</b> characteristics, <b>dropping</b> from peaks before the establishment of CTPs to nadirs a few years into trading. This finding is consistent with innovators deciding during trading that their research and development investments should be reduced, based on assessments of future market conditions under the relevant CTPs.

50|$|The {{function}} of this capacitor, {{known as a}} reservoir capacitor (or smoothing capacitor) is to lessen the variation in (or 'smooth') the rectified AC output voltage waveform from the bridge. There is still some variation, known as ripple. One explanation of 'smoothing' is that the capacitor provides {{a low impedance path}} to the AC component of the output, reducing the AC voltage across, and AC current through, the resistive load. In less <b>technical</b> terms, any <b>drop</b> in the output voltage and current of the bridge tends to be cancelled by loss of charge in the capacitor. This charge flows out as additional current through the load. Thus the change of load current and voltage is reduced relative to what would occur without the capacitor. Increases of voltage correspondingly store excess charge in the capacitor, thus moderating the change in output voltage / current.|$|R

50|$|Prior to the race, it {{was assumed}} that one of the {{competitors}} in the WSC class of Le Mans Prototype would easily take the win, since they were custom built racing cars with no relation to street cars like GT1 cars. However, during the race, various WSC cars succumbed to <b>technical</b> difficulties and <b>dropped</b> well down in the standings, while the GT1 class cars continued on without difficulty. In the closing hours of the race, five McLaren F1 GTRs were still racing while only three WSC cars remained.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} some of {{the outcomes}} associated with the adoption of digital mammography in Breastscreen Queensland's mobile services to rural and remote parts of the state. A fleet of six mobile services, equipped with digital mammography equipment service these locations. Digital technologies, especially in spatially mobile screening venues, are seen to offer a number of advantages. First being able to immediately check the image quality {{to determine whether the}} image will suffice for screening purposes by a radiologist and can help reduce the number of client recalls due to technical issues. Secondly {{it has been suggested that}} digital mammography leads to enhanced job satisfaction on the part of radiographers, though the removal of the need to handle hazardous chemicals, and improved design of the mammography equipment. The digital technology is supported by a web based client information systems connected to BSQ databases through commercial 3 G wireless services. The roll-out of digital breast screening technology only commenced in 2009 so the elapsed time between the introduction of the technology and our evaluation is relatively short. Therefore this paper focuses on outcomes that are already becoming apparent such as reduced rates of client recall due to technical issues with the images, while other benefits such as increased cancer detection rates will take time to accrue. The outcomes of the adoption of digital mammography in BreastScreen Queensland's mobile services are examined from the perspective of the client and the radiographer workforce. Using recent data we have found that for three mobile services, the <b>technical</b> recall rate <b>drops</b> to less than 1 % following the introduction of digital mammography. This represents a decline in the technical recall rate of from 70 % in one case to 100 % in another. This decline in technical recall rates is greater than that which has hitherto been reported in the literature. Interviews and surveys of the BSQ workforce have shown that the digital mammography equipment was easier to operate and provides immediate "feedback" to the operator. This research found 95 % of respondents (N= 50) had high to very high job satisfaction, 73 % indicated a high to very high reduction in physical workloads associated with digital technology, while 52 % indicated that digital technology was either an important or very important factor in deciding to stay in their current jobs. Savings in the cost of client travel and time have been quantified, and significant difference between the amount of the costs savings were observed between services operating in different regions of Queensland.
