40|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{democracy}} in 1994, the taxi industry transformation concentrated mainly on the minibus taxi type services such that not much focus {{was given to the}} <b>metered</b> <b>taxi</b> industry.

5000|$|Much of {{the reason}} for the notoriety of the GST in Canada is for reasons of an obscure Constitutional provision. Other {{countries}} with a Value Added Tax legislate that posted prices include the tax; thus, consumers are vaguely aware of it but [...] "what they see is what they pay". Canada cannot do this because jurisdiction over most advertising and price-posting is in the domain of the provinces under the Constitution Act, 1867. The provinces have chosen not to require prices to include the GST, similar to their provincial sales taxes. As a result, virtually all prices (except for fuel pump prices, <b>taxi</b> <b>meters</b> and a few other things) are shown [...] "pre-GST", with the tax (or taxes) listed separately.|$|E

However, the <b>metered</b> <b>taxi</b> industry is facing a lot of challenges that seem to be neglected by the authorities concerned hence drivers have lost faith in the concerned authorities. Operational costs of the <b>metered</b> <b>taxi</b> are surging thereby preventing drivers from getting profit {{at the end of the}} day and therefore threatening the sustainability of the industry as more people are forced out of the <b>metered</b> <b>taxi</b> industry to look for other lucrative jobs elsewhere...|$|R

5000|$|Illegal taxicabs, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} gypsy cabs, are taxicabs and other for-hire vehicles {{that are not}} duly licensed or permitted by the jurisdiction in which they operate. Most major cities worldwide require taxicabs to be licensed, safety-inspected, insured as for-hire vehicles and use <b>taxi</b> <b>meters</b> and {{there may also be}} requirements that the taxi driver be registered or accredited. However, many unlicensed cabs are in operation. Illegal cabs may be marked taxi vehicles (sometimes referred to as [...] "speedy cabs"), and others are personal vehicles used by an individual to offer unauthorized taxi-like services. Illegal cabs are prevalent in cities with medallion systems, which restrict the number of legal cabs in operation. Since their introduction in 2009, Uber taxis, which are crowd-sourced smartphone-enabled unlicensed taxis, have been classified as illegal taxicabs in some jurisdictions.|$|E

The Court imposed the highest ever penalty for misuse of market power, imposing a fine of $15 million ($14 million in civil penalties and $1 million in costs).|$|E
