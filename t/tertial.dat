5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} is {{strongly}} sexually dimorphic as {{male and female}} purple-throated cotingas have few similarities in their plumage. The male has black upperparts, including the head, wings, and tail. The feathers on the bird's back to its uppertail coverts, {{as well as its}} upperwing coverts, have white fringes. There is also a conspicuous white wingstripe and white edges to the <b>tertial</b> feathers. Additionally the male has a deeply purple throat and a white belly, with some black barring on its rear flanks.|$|E
5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} (Porphyrolaema porphyrolaema) is {{a species of}} bird in the cotinga family, Cotingidae. It {{is found in the}} western Amazon {{rainforest}} of South America; its range extends from southern Colombia south through eastern Ecuador and Peru and east through extreme northwestern Bolivia and into western Amazonian Brazil. It lives in the canopy or along the borders of humid forest throughout its range. The purple-throated cotinga is monotypic within the genus Porphyrolaema and has no known subspecies. It is one of the smaller cotinga species and expresses strong sexual dimorphism. Males have black upperparts with a bold white wingstripe and white edges to the <b>tertial</b> feathers and a white belly with some black barring on the rear flanks. The throat is a deep purple, giving the bird both its common and scientific names. Females are dark brown with pale buffy margins on the upperparts, buffy cinnamon with black barring on the underparts, and rufous on the throat. The male has a powerful voice.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Du Tertre's crude 1667 {{drawing and}} Labat's 1722 derivative, a few {{contemporary}} paintings depict red macaws {{that may be}} the Lesser Antillean macaw. A color plate accompanying a 1765 volume of Buffon's encyclopaedia Histoire Naturelle (no. 12 in Planches Enluminées, entitled L'Ara Rouge) shows a red macaw with entirely red tail feathers and more red on the <b>tertial</b> and scapular feathers of the wing than are present on the scarlet macaw. Copies of the plate differ in the nuances used, but are identical in pattern. The painting suggests that a specimen may have been present in Europe at the time. The Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus cited the plate in his 1766 description of the scarlet macaw, but his description does not match the bird shown. A 1626 painting by the Dutch artist Roelant Savery, which also includes a dodo, shows a red macaw that agrees with the descriptions of the Lesser Antillean macaw. A second macaw in the painting may be the hypothetical extinct Martinique macaw (A. martinicus), but though many parrots were imported into Europe at the time from all over the world, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of such paintings today.|$|E
500|$|<b>Tertials</b> {{arise in}} the brachial region and are not {{considered}} true remiges as they are not supported by attachment to the corresponding bone, {{in this case the}} humerus. These elongated [...] "true" [...] <b>tertials</b> act as a protective cover for {{all or part of the}} folded primaries and secondaries, and do not qualify as flight feathers as such. However, many authorities use the term <b>tertials</b> to refer to the shorter, more symmetrical innermost secondaries of passerines (arising from the olecranon and performing the same function as true <b>tertials)</b> in an effort to distinguish them from other secondaries. The term humeral is sometimes used for birds such as the albatrosses and pelicans that have a long humerus.|$|R
5000|$|A. b. excelsus can {{be found}} in Guadalcanal in the Salomon Islands. The adult female is more olive-green on the back, scapulars, and <b>tertials,</b> and has much paler orange underparts than the other subspecies. An {{immature}} male has the upper back, scapular, and <b>tertials</b> very dark olive-green.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>tertials</b> of flavirostris have indistinct pale fringes, whereas these pale fringes {{are more}} {{noticeable}} on albifrons ...|$|R
500|$|The Negros {{fruit dove}} is a small, short-tailed fruit dove. Only the {{appearance}} of the adult female is known as the presumed male specimen was lost in the undergrowth. The female is a vivid dark green overall with an ash-grey forehead above an extensive ring of bare yellow skin that surrounds the eye. The greater coverts and <b>tertial</b> feathers have broad yellow fringes that create a narrow, if conspicuous, wingbar when the wing is folded. The throat is white while the vent and undertail coverts are yellow. The bill was black and the feet were a dull purplish-red. The fruit dove is [...] long.|$|E
500|$|The Nauru {{reed warbler}} is a {{medium-sized}} and warmly coloured reed warbler, {{with a relatively}} light build. The entirety of the upperparts are dark brown, with the rump and uppertail coverts slightly brighter than the tail and mantle. When closed, the wing is the same colour as the mantle, short and rounded. The wing does not reach {{the start of the}} tail feathers, which enhances the appearance of a long tail. Close inspection of the wing reveals darker centres to both the greater coverts and <b>tertial</b> feathers. Its face shows little contrast, as the ear coverts, crown, nape, chin and throat are all a similar shade of pale brown. The lores are a dark brown, and there is a pale, creamy supercilium, or [...] "eyebrow", extending from the beak to the ear coverts, which are a cinnamon-brown, darkening and merging with the nape. The beak is long, thin and straight.|$|E
50|$|In {{both sexes}} there are {{narrower}} pencilled white stripes along the <b>tertial</b> wing feathers; when {{the bird is}} in repose, then if the <b>tertial</b> feather stripes are visible, they have the appearance of longitudinal white stripes along the bird's lower back.|$|E

500|$|Also tertials; {{tertiary}} feathers; humeral feathers. A type of feather arising in the brachial region, i.e., [...] "proximal to {{the innermost}} secondaries", usually growing in a grouping {{of three to}} four feathers. They are not considered true [...] as they are not supported by attachment to the corresponding bone—in this case the humerus. These elongated [...] "true" [...] <b>tertials</b> act as a protective cover for {{all or part of}} the folded [...] and , and do not qualify as flight feathers as such.

The term humeral is sometimes used for birds such as the albatrosses and pelicans that have a long humerus.|$|R
50|$|Young {{birds have}} scaly black-brown upperparts and a neat wing pattern. They take {{four years to}} reach maturity. Identification from {{juvenile}} herring gulls is most readily done by the more solidly dark (unbarred) <b>tertial</b> feathers.|$|E
50|$|The adult female {{is similar}} but duller; the green patch over {{the bill is}} matte, the throat is plain buff, and the breast is buff with many green spots. The female also lacks the <b>tertial</b> patch.|$|E
50|$|The female is sandy grey-brown {{above and}} buff-white below. It {{is similar to}} female Sardinian and subalpine warblers but has plainer <b>tertial</b> {{feathers}} and more contrast between the pale back and dark tail. First-winter males are similar to females but may have some pink on the throat and breast.|$|E
25|$|Harpactes erythrocephalus helenae: {{both sexes}} are {{slightly}} larger than H. erythrocephalus erythrocephalus. In addition, the coverts and outer webs of the <b>tertials</b> and secondaries are more finely vermiculated.|$|R
5000|$|I. m. salvinii - Cassin, 1867: {{found in}} the Caribbean {{lowlands}} of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, has no yellow fringes to the <b>tertials</b> and is more orange than the nominate race ...|$|R
50|$|Molt begins {{earlier in}} males than in females, and in second-year birds than in older ones. Primaries, secondaries, <b>tertials</b> and rectrices are {{replaced}} sequentially, so the bird can still fly during molting.|$|R
5000|$|P. p. dresseri, {{found in}} central & S England, Wales and W France. Still {{present in the}} far {{south-east}} of Scotland but in small numbers. Slightly smaller than palustris and more brown or olive-coloured on upperparts and dirtier below. Pale brown <b>tertial</b> fringes can sometimes cause confusion with willow tit ...|$|E
50|$|The {{wood warbler}} is 11-12.5 cm long, and a typical leaf warbler in appearance, green above and white below with a lemon-yellow breast. It can be {{distinguished}} from similar species, like the chiffchaff P. collybita and the willow warbler, P. trochilus by its yellow supercilium, throat and upper breast, pale <b>tertial</b> edges, longer primary projection, and by its shorter but broader tail.|$|E
50|$|It is 13 to 14 cm long. The upperparts are {{plain and}} dark grey-brown {{apart from a}} pale wingbar and pale edging to the <b>tertial</b> feathers. The breast and flanks have a {{variable}} amount of streaky dark grey-brown. This is unlike the similar Asian brown flycatcher which has rather plain pale underparts and the grey-streaked flycatcher which is white below with distinct grey streaks.|$|E
50|$|The head, mantle, scapulars, {{back and}} upper rump are blackish-brown. The nape, mantle and scapulars, back and upper rump are washed silvery-gray. Some scapulars and the longest <b>tertials</b> have narrow but {{distinct}} white edges.|$|R
50|$|M. p. guatemalae, {{which is}} found from Chiapas in {{southern}} Mexico to northern Nicaragua, {{has little or}} no white edging on the <b>tertials</b> and less white on the fourth rectrix of the tail. It is non-migratory.|$|R
50|$|Non-breeding and first-winter {{males are}} similar but much duller and browner. Females are mostly grey-brown. They have a rufous tail {{with a dark}} centre, a pale eye-ring, two buff wingbars and buff edges to the <b>tertials.</b>|$|R
50|$|In many respects, {{including}} long <b>tertial</b> feathers, larks resemble other ground birds such as pipits. However, in larks the tarsus (the lowest leg bone, {{connected to}} the toes) has only one set of scales on the rear surface, which is rounded. Pipits and all other songbirds have two plates of scales on the rear surface, which meet at a protruding rear edge (Ridgway 1907).|$|E
5000|$|First-winter birds {{differ from}} adult females in {{appearance}} {{in that they}} have a grey-brown neck and upper parts; the upper parts of adult females are much darker [...] - [...] nearly black. Furthermore, the young birds have narrower white edges to their <b>tertial</b> feathers than adults do. Females of all ages are dark-eyed, whereas in males the eyes become pale during their first winter.|$|E
50|$|The sexes {{are similar}} in appearance. The bird is pale green to olive green above and has a yellowish-white rump. The head pattern is {{noticeable}} and striking in appearance, with a well-defined pale eyebrow stripe, a faint yellow median crown stripe and dusky-olive lateral crown stripes. The <b>tertial</b> feathers are sepia-colored and have whitish tips. The eye {{is surrounded by a}} broken eyering; the iris of the eye is dark brown.|$|E
25|$|Harpactes erythrocephalus intermedius: in this subspecies, the coverts {{and outer}} webs of the <b>tertials</b> and {{secondaries}} are more finely vermiculated. The male's plumage is brighter, the female’s darker, more intense. It {{can be found}} in Southern China, Northern Laos, and Northern Vietnam.|$|R
50|$|It {{is a small}} tchagra, {{measuring}} 16-17 cm {{from bill}} tip to tail tip. They are distinct from other tchagras in having a narrow, black median stripe over the crown, without any superciliary stripe. In addition the <b>tertials</b> and rectrices are mouse-brown in colour.|$|R
500|$|Secondaries {{are always}} {{numbered}} ascendantly, {{starting with the}} outermost secondary (the one closest to the primaries) and working inwards. [...] <b>Tertials</b> are also numbered ascendantly, but in this case, the numbers continue on consecutively from that given to the last secondary (e.g. ... S5, S6, T7, T8, ... etc.).|$|R
50|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{features of}} the species are the short wing and tail; white edging to tertials converging broadly at the tip, versus <b>tertial</b> tips black to only narrowly white in tiphia and a smaller and shorter bill than tiphia from any part of India. The vocalizations are also different. The species is best known from northwestern India, however only a few verified specimen records exist from southern India. It is now also known from Sri Lanka.|$|E
5000|$|Hume's leaf warbler {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} [...] "Old World warblers". Like most other leaf warblers, it has greenish upperparts and off-white underparts. With its long supercilium, crown stripe and yellow-margined <b>tertial</b> remiges, it is very similar to the yellow-browed warbler (P. inornatus). However, it has only one prominent light wing bar, just a faint vestige of the second shorter wing bar, and overall duller colours. It also has a dark lower mandible and legs.|$|E
5000|$|Spizella wortheni {{can range}} in length from 12.5 to 14 cm. It is {{identifiable}} by its distinctive head pattern. It has a grey {{head with a}} rufous crown, a brown postocular stripe and a pink bill. It has grey-brown upperparts, with dark brown streaks. It has a grey bottom, and dark brown wings and tail. Its wings are [...] "edged paler, with broad whitish to pale buff wing-bar, buffy-rufous <b>tertial</b> and secondary edging, and greyish lesser coverts".|$|E
50|$|Like {{many other}} seabirds, the horned puffin is countershaded for {{camouflage}} against both aerial and undersea predators. The underparts (breast, throat, belly, flanks and vent) are white, while the upper parts (mantle, scapulars, coverts, primaries, <b>tertials</b> and rump) are black. The {{legs and feet}} are orange.|$|R
5000|$|Secondaries {{are always}} {{numbered}} ascendantly, {{starting with the}} outermost secondary (the one closest to the primaries) and working inwards. [...] <b>Tertials</b> are also numbered ascendantly, but in this case, the numbers continue on consecutively from that given to the last secondary (e.g. ... S5, S6, T7, T8, ... etc.).|$|R
50|$|It is 10 cm long, {{slightly}} larger than Pallas's warbler. It has greenish upperparts, pale underparts and a pale rump. The head has a long white supercilium and a pale stripe along {{the centre of the}} crown. The wings have one conspicuous wingbar, a slight second bar and whitish edges to the <b>tertials.</b>|$|R
