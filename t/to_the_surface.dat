5|$|Arctic terns {{sometimes}} dip down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of {{the water}} to catch prey close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> They may also chase insects in the air when breeding. It is also thought that Arctic terns may, {{in spite of their}} small size, occasionally engage in kleptoparasitism by swooping at birds so as to startle them into releasing their catches. Several species are targeted—conspecifics, other terns (like the common tern), and some auk and grebe species.|$|E

5|$|When {{ready to}} emerge, several {{different}} strategies are used. In some species, {{the transformation of}} the nymph occurs underwater and the subimago swims <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> and launches itself into the air. In other species, the nymph rises <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> bursts out of its skin, remains quiescent {{for a minute or two}} resting on the exuviae (cast skin) and then flies upwards, and in some, the nymph climbs out of the water before transforming.|$|E
5|$|A {{decompression}} {{schedule is}} a specified ascent rate and series of increasingly shallower decompression stops—often for {{increasing amounts of}} time—that a diver performs to outgas inert gases from their body during ascent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> {{to reduce the risk}} of decompression sickness. In a decompression dive, the decompression phase may make up a large part of the time spent underwater (in many cases it is longer than the actual time spent at depth).|$|E
5|$|A delayed or {{deployable}} surface {{marker buoy}} (DSMB) is a soft inflatable tube which {{is attached to}} a reel or spool line at one end, and is inflated by the diver under water and released to float <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> deploying the line as it ascends. This provides information <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> that the diver is about to ascend, and where he is. This equipment is commonly used by recreational and technical divers, and requires a certain level of skill to operate safely. Once deployed, it can be used for the same purposes as the standard surface marker and reel, and in the same way, but they are mostly used to signal the boat that the diver has started ascent or to indicate a problem in technical diving.|$|E

5|$|After {{incubating}} {{for around}} 80 days, hatchlings dig through the sand <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> usually at night, when darkness increases {{the chance of}} escaping predation and damage from extreme sand surface temperatures is reduced.

5|$|All of the Solar System planets except Mercury have {{substantial}} atmospheres because their gravity {{is strong enough}} to keep gases close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> The larger giant planets are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases hydrogen and helium, whereas the smaller planets lose these gases into space.

5000|$|The {{first part}} is the curve point algorithm, which determines to a {{starting}} point {{in the vicinity of}} <b>the</b> two <b>surfaces</b> a point on the intersection curve. The algorithm depends essentially on the representation of <b>the</b> given <b>surfaces.</b> <b>The</b> simplest situation is where both surfaces are implicitly given by equations , because the functions provide information about <b>the</b> distances <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> and show via the gradients <b>the</b> way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces.</b> If one or both <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> are parametrically given, the advantages of the implicit case do not exist. In this case, the curve point algorithm uses time-consuming procedures like the determination of the footpoint of a perpendicular on a surface.|$|R

5|$|Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly {{preying on}} insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods. The most common {{procedure}} is sighting the prey, stalking, fastening a silk safety line <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> using the two pairs of back legs {{to jump on the}} victim, and finally biting the prey. Most jumping spiders walk throughout the day, so that they maximize their chances of a catch.|$|E

50|$|Another {{surface tension}} effect is {{capillary}} waves, which are <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> ripples that form around {{the impacts of}} drops on water surfaces, and sometimes occur with strong subsurface currents flowing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water <b>surface.</b> <b>The</b> apparent elasticity caused by <b>surface</b> tension drives <b>the</b> waves. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> tension of water allows certain insects <b>to</b> walk on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of water. This {{is caused by the}} strength of the hydrogen bonds, making it difficult <b>to</b> break <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of water.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>surface</b> {{energy of}} a liquid may be {{measured}} by stretching a liquid membrane (which increases <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> area and hence <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> energy). In that case, in order <b>to</b> increase <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> area of a mass of liquid by an amount, δA, a quantity of work, γδA, is needed (where γ is <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> energy density of the liquid). However, such a method cannot be used <b>to</b> measure <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> {{energy of a}} solid because stretching of a solid membrane induces elastic energy in the bulk in addition <b>to</b> increasing <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> energy.|$|R
