5|$|This was {{repeated}} the following season, {{and so in}} 1971 Andover <b>took</b> <b>another</b> <b>step</b> up and joined the Southern League. Now competing against teams from an even wider area spanning almost the entire width of the country (ranging from Bideford {{in the west to}} Bury Town in the east) and in some cases with a larger budget and fanbase, competition was always tough with the club generally finishing in {{the bottom half of the}} table. The highest position the club reached at this level was the sixth place reached in 1987–88 and again in 1991–92.|$|E
5|$|A major crisis {{gripped the}} ACLU in 1968 when a debate erupted {{over whether to}} defend Benjamin Spock and the Boston Five against federal charges that they {{encouraged}} draftees to avoid the draft. The ACLU board was deeply split over whether to defend the activists; half the board harbored anti-war sentiments, and felt that the ACLU should lend its resources {{to the cause of}} the Boston Five. The other half of the board believed that civil liberties were not at stake, and the ACLU would be taking a political stance. Behind the debate was the longstanding ACLU tradition that it was politically impartial, and provided legal advice without regard to the political views of the defendants. The board finally agreed to a compromise solution that permitted the ACLU to defend the anti-war activists, without endorsing the activist's political views. Some critics of the ACLU suggest that the ACLU became a partisan political organization following the Spock case. After the Kent State shootings in 1970, ACLU leaders <b>took</b> <b>another</b> <b>step</b> towards politics by passing a resolution condemning the Vietnam War. The resolution was based in a variety of legal arguments, including civil liberties violations and a claim that the war was illegal.|$|E

25|$|As NHL play resumed in 2005–06, Gáborík <b>took</b> <b>another</b> <b>step</b> forward, {{becoming}} a point-per-game player with 38 goals and 66 {{points in a}} 65-game season limited by a groin injury. His season was shortened once more the following season in 2006–07, re-injuring his groin on 20 October 2006, against the Anaheim Ducks. Despite a 10- to 14-day estimated recovery time, he {{did not return to}} the lineup until 6 January 2007, against the Colorado Avalanche two-and-a-half months later. Although Gáborík missed 34 games, he still managed a second consecutive 30-goal season to go with 57 points overall.|$|E
25|$|AGS <b>took</b> <b>another</b> <b>step</b> {{ahead in}} 1978 {{when the team}} started {{competing}} in the European Formula 2 Championship. Still, the car - by now the AGS JH15 - was self-penned (by Vanderpleyn), self-built and self-run. Formula 2 was a difficult task for the small team, racing 1978 and 1979 without scoring any championship points. The early 1980s were somewhat better. AGS {{was one of the}} few teams who ran its own cars (Maurer, Minardi and Merzario were the others), and eventually the team was able to score points regularly. Soon some victories came, too. AGS made history when works driver Philippe Streiff won the final race of Formula 2 in 1984, using an AGS JH19C.|$|E
25|$|Starting in the United Kingdom in the 18th century, the Industrial Revolution was {{a period}} of great {{technological}} discovery, particularly in the areas of agriculture, manufacturing, mining, metallurgy, and transport, driven by the discovery of steam power. Technology <b>took</b> <b>another</b> <b>step</b> in a second industrial revolution with the harnessing of electricity to create such innovations as the electric motor, light bulb, and countless others. Scientific advancement and the discovery of new concepts later allowed for powered flight and advancements in medicine, chemistry, physics, and engineering. The rise in technology has led to skyscrapers and broad urban areas whose inhabitants rely on motors to transport them and their food supply. Communication was also greatly improved with the invention of the telegraph, telephone, radio and television. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a revolution in transportation with the invention of the airplane and automobile.|$|E

25|$|The {{rumor that}} Swedlund was {{replaced}} by an Air Force officer sometimes arises given that the Ministry of Defense chose to prioritize new aircraft over nuclear weapons. Some {{have pointed out that}} the increase in flexibility was likely due to replacing Swedlund with somebody new, as his successor did not have a strong opinion one way or the other. In the 1965 report, the Commander-in-Chief <b>took</b> <b>another</b> <b>step</b> away from assuming a nuclear armed Sweden. Although they were still advocating for Swedish nuclear weapons in general terms, they were no longer emphasized in defense planning. They felt that there was an imminent risk that Swedish nuclear possession would be prohibited {{as a result of the}} ongoing disarmament negotiations. The report also looked favorably on the notion of defending Sweden with modern conventional forces as they now embraced the Margin Doctrine. The Margin Doctrine assumed that an invasion of Sweden would not occur in isolation, but rather as a part of a major conflict; in such a situation, a large power (e.g. the USSR) would be unlikely to deploy its full military forces against Sweden.|$|E
25|$|Howard <b>took</b> <b>another</b> <b>step</b> {{forward as}} the {{franchise}} player for Orlando in the 2006–07 season, {{and for the}} third consecutive season he played in all 82 regular season games. On February 1, 2007, he received his first NBA All-Star selection as a reserve on the Eastern Conference squad for the 2007 NBA All-Star Game. Howard finished the game with 20 points and 12 rebounds. Less than a week later, he recorded a career-high 32 points against the Toronto Raptors. A highlight was his game-winning alley-oop off an inbound pass at the buzzer against the San Antonio Spurs at Amway Arena on February 9. As the push for playoff spots intensified, Howard was instrumental, recording another career-high 35 points against the Philadelphia 76ers on April 14, 2007. Under his leadership, the Magic qualified for the 2007 NBA Playoffs {{for the first time since}} 2003 as the number eight seed in the Eastern Conference. However, the Magic were swept by the eventual Eastern Conference finalist Detroit Pistons in the first round. Howard averaged 17.6 points and 12.3 rebounds per game, and finished first in the NBA in total rebounds, second in field goal percentage, and ninth in blocks. He was further recognized as one of the best players in the league when he was named to the All-NBA Third Team at the end of the 2006–07 campaign.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} reduce the risk of Ottoman expeditions {{prompted}} by Venice, Skanderbeg took several steps to soften relations with the Republic. In the autumn of 1452, Đurađ Branković attacked the Venetian city of Cattaro. Skanderbeg sent a troop of men to aid the Venetians to thwart the attack, but Venice, despite thanking the Albanian, still held its animosity towards him. Skanderbeg <b>took</b> <b>another</b> <b>step.</b> He sent an [...] "orator", Ezop Zguri, to Alfonso in order to ask for military aid and to convince Alfonso to urge for a reconciliation with Venice. The first request could not be fulfilled: Alfonso responded that he had neither the men nor the means to help Skanderbeg. The second request, however, was satisfied and on 5 March 1453, Alfonso sent a letter censuring Venice for not paying its dues to Skanderbeg and also for supporting Skanderbeg's enemies. He thus urged for a peremptory measure to all Albanian-Venetian conflicts.|$|E

For Al Glendinning, it represented the first time he'd finished with a record under [...]500 since being hired as coach. Bryan Leitch was a major bright spot, scoring 87 points in 51 games, fifth among BCHL leading scorers. This season also marked the rookie debut of forward Casey Pierro-Zabotel. [...] At the trade deadline, Glendinning shook up his team, dealing forwards Bill Vandermeer and Blair Riley to the Nanaimo Clippers for forwards Daryle Hurd, Kevin Lessard, defenceman Rylan Burns, and future considerations. For the fourth straight season, the Centennials were dispatched in the opening round of the playoffs, losing to the Salmon Arm Silverbacks in five games.|$|E

2500|$|Australia, {{again without}} the resting Ricky Ponting notched up {{consecutive}} victories over Sri Lanka; on 26 January in Adelaide, they successfully chased down 219 {{to win by}} five wickets after a half-century from Simon Katich, while makeshift captain Adam Gilchrist shared an opening stand of 191 with Katich at Perth three days later, when Australia needed 234 to win. In the two ING matches on 29 January, the Redbacks went unbeaten for their third 50-over match in a row after chasing 223 successfully against the Bushrangers, while the Warriors defended 236 against the Tigers despite 105 from Tigers captain Michael Di Venuto. To round off the month, South Africa and Sri Lanka entertained the Perth crowd, and a spell of 10–3–17–2 from Shaun Pollock limited Sri Lanka to 221.
