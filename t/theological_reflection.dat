5|$|The Assembly {{worked in}} the Reformed Protestant {{theological}} tradition, also known as Calvinism. It took the Bible as the authoritative word of God, from which all <b>theological</b> <b>reflection</b> must be based. The divines were committed to the Reformed doctrine of predestination—that God chooses certain men to be saved and enjoy eternal life rather than eternal punishment. There was some disagreement at the Assembly over the doctrine of particular redemption—that Christ died only for those chosen for salvation. The Assembly also held to Reformed covenant theology, a framework for interpreting the Bible. The Assembly's Confession {{is the first of}} the Reformed confessions to teach a doctrine called the covenant of works, which teaches that before the fall of man, God promised eternal life to Adam on condition that he perfectly obeyed God.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli was {{primarily}} a teacher of scripture rather than a systematic theologian, but his lasting influence is mostly associated with his doctrine of the Eucharist. This {{can be explained by}} the close relationship he saw between exegesis of scripture and <b>theological</b> <b>reflection.</b> Vermigli's method of biblical commentary, similar to that of Martin Bucer, was to include extended discussions of doctrinal topics treated by the biblical texts. Like other Protestants, he believed scripture alone held supreme authority in establishing truth. Nevertheless, he was familiar with the church fathers to a higher degree than many of his contemporaries, and he constantly referred to them. He saw value in the fathers because they had discovered insights into the scriptures that he might not have found, and because many of his Catholic opponents placed great weight on arguments from patristic authority. Often, though, he used the fathers as support for interpretations he had already reached on his own and was not concerned when his interpretation had no patristic precedent.|$|E

25|$|From {{the fifteenth}} century, Renaissance humanism {{encouraged}} critical <b>theological</b> <b>reflection</b> {{and calls for}} ecclesiastical renewal in Scotland. As early as 1495 some Scots were in contact with Desiderius Erasmus (1466–1536), the Netherlands-born leading figure in the northern humanist movement. They were also in contact with Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples (c. 1455– 1536), a French humanist and scholar who like Erasmus argued strongly for reform of the Catholic Church by the elimination of corruption and abuses. Scottish scholars often studied on the Continent and at English universities. Humanist scholars trained on the Continent were recruited to the new Scottish universities founded at St Andrews, the Glasgow, and Aberdeen. These international contacts helped integrate Scotland into a wider European scholarly world and {{were one of the}} most important ways in which the new ideas of humanism entered Scottish intellectual life. By 1497 the humanist and historian Hector Boece, who was born in Dundee and studied at Paris, returned to become the first principal at the new university of Aberdeen.|$|E

2500|$|Pope Benedict XVI {{concluded}} that Bernard’s [...] "theology of the heart" [...] and Abelard’s [...] "theology of reason" [...] represent {{the importance of}} healthy theological discussion, especially when the questions being debated have not been defined by the magisterium, and humble obedience {{to the authority of}} the Church. St. Bernard, and even Abelard himself, always recognized without any hesitation the authority of the magisterium. Abelard showed humility in acknowledging his errors, and Bernard exercised great [...] The Pope emphasized, in the field of theology, there should be a balance between architectonic principles, which are given through Revelation and which always maintain their primary importance, and the interpretative principles proposed by philosophy (that is, by reason), which have an important function, but only as a tool. When the balance breaks down, <b>theological</b> <b>reflection</b> runs the risk of becoming marred by error; it is then up to the magisterium to exercise the needed service to truth, for which it is responsible.|$|E

2500|$|Among those {{historians who}} doubt the massacre's historicity, Geza Vermes and E. P. Sanders regard {{the story as}} part of a {{creative}} hagiography. Some scholars argue that the story is an apologetic device or a contrived fulfillment of prophecy, while others point to the silence of Josephus, who records several examples of Herod's use of violence to protect his power, including the murder of his own sons. Robert Eisenman argues that the story may have its origins in Herod's murder of his sons, an act which made a deep impression at the time. David Hill acknowledges that the episode [...] "contains nothing that is historically impossible," [...] but adds that Matthew's [...] "real concern is ... with <b>theological</b> <b>reflection</b> on the theme of [...] fulfillment". Stephen Harris and Raymond Brown similarly contend that Matthew's purpose is to present Jesus as the Messiah, and the Massacre of the Innocents as the fulfillment of passages in Hosea (referring to the exodus), and in Jeremiah (referring to the Babylonian exile). Brown also sees the story as patterned on the Exodus account of the birth of Moses and the killing of the Hebrew firstborn by Pharaoh.|$|E
2500|$|Gailey indicates, that by 1932 these policy {{statements}} {{had been}} broadened to full [...] "three-self" [...] language, with the instruction to missionaries to cultivate among local Christians [...] "self support, self leadership {{and responsibility for}} the propagation of the gospel in that field." [...] The [...] "language was unchanged for the next twenty years, and has remained essentially intact until the present time." [...] By the 1930s, Nazarene missions leaders [...] "did not aim toward the development of autonomous national churches, but a federation of districts. They did not plan for indefinite missionary control. Without {{a great deal of}} thought about where this would lead, without consciously copying any other denomination's model of church government, and without much <b>theological</b> <b>reflection,</b> the Church of the Nazarene became an international body." [...] The first non-missionary district superintendents were George Sharpe (born in Scotland in 1865; died 1948) in Britain (November 1915) and Vicente G. Santin (1870–1948), appointed district superintendent in Mexico in 1919. In January 1936 the General Board divided the Japan District into two, and the Western or Kwansai district became the first regular district in the denomination, [...] "with all the rights and privileges of any of the North American and British Isles districts subject to the Manual and the General Assembly," [...] however the effects of World War II on the church in Japan saw the two districts reunified and revert to a missionary-led district.|$|E
