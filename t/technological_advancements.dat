5|$|The PV {{industry}} has seen drops in module prices since 2008. In late 2011, factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules dropped below the $1.00/W mark. The $1.00/W installed cost, is often regarded in the PV industry as marking {{the achievement of}} grid parity for PV. These reductions have taken many stakeholders, including industry analysts, by surprise, and perceptions of current solar power economics often lags behind reality. Some stakeholders still have the perspective that solar PV remains too costly on an unsubsidized basis to compete with conventional generation options. Yet <b>technological</b> <b>advancements,</b> manufacturing process improvements, and industry re-structuring, mean that further price reductions are likely in coming years.|$|E
5|$|The first scientifically useful {{observation}} of Neptune from ground-based telescopes using adaptive optics, was commenced in 1997 from Hawaii. Neptune is currently entering its {{spring and summer}} season and {{has been shown to}} be heating up, with increased atmospheric activity and brightness as a consequence. Combined with <b>technological</b> <b>advancements,</b> ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics are recording increasingly more detailed images of it. Both Hubble and the adaptive-optics telescopes on Earth have made many new discoveries within the Solar System since the mid-1990s, with a large increase in the number of known satellites and moons around the outer planet, among others. In 2004 and 2005, five new small satellites of Neptune with diameters between 38 and 61 kilometres were discovered.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to empirically {{investigate}} the mediating impact of export performance (EP) between <b>technological</b> <b>advancement</b> capabilities (TAC) and business performance (BP) of Malaysian manufacturing MSME’s. Firm’s <b>technological</b> <b>advancement</b> resources are hypothesized as a platform to enhance both exports and business performance of manufacturing MSMEs in Malaysia. This study is twofold, primary it has investigated that <b>technological</b> <b>advancement</b> capabilities helps to appreciates main performance measures noted in terms of export performance and Secondly it investigates that how efficiently and effectively <b>technological</b> <b>advancement</b> capabilities can contributes in overall Malaysian MSME’s business performance. Smart PLS- 3 statistical software is used to know the association between <b>technological</b> <b>advancement</b> capabilities, MSME’s export performance and business performance. In this study the data was composed from Malaysian manufacturing MSME’s in east coast industrial zones known as manufacturing hub of MSMEs. Seven Hundred and Fifty (750) questionnaires were distributed but only 148 usable questionnaires are returned. The finding of this study indicated that <b>technological</b> <b>advancement</b> capabilities helps to strengthen the export in term of time and cost efficient and it plays a significant role in appreciating their business performance. This study is helpful for small and medium enterprises owners who intent to expand their business overseas and though smart <b>technological</b> <b>advancement</b> resources they can achieve their business competitiveness and excellence both at local and international markets...|$|R

5|$|Former World Bank Chief Economist {{and former}} Chairman of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers Joseph E. Stiglitz {{referred}} {{in the late}} 1990s to a growing consensus {{that something is wrong}} with a system having the capacity to impose high costs on a great {{number of people who are}} hardly even participants in international financial markets, neither speculating on international investments nor borrowing in foreign currencies. He argued that foreign crises have strong worldwide repercussions due in part to the phenomenon of moral hazard, particularly when many multinational firms deliberately invest in highly risky government bonds in anticipation of a national or international bailout. Although crises can be overcome by emergency financing, employing bailouts places a heavy burden on taxpayers living in the afflicted countries, and the high costs damage standards of living. Stiglitz has advocated finding means of stabilizing short-term international capital flows without adversely affecting long-term foreign direct investment which usually carries new knowledge spillover and <b>technological</b> <b>advancements</b> into economies.|$|E
