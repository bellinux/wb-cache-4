5|$|Adaptation {{had been}} in {{development}} {{as far back as}} 1994. Jonathan Demme brought the project to Columbia Pictures with Kaufman writing the script. Kaufman experienced writer's block and did not know what <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Orchid Thief. Finally he wrote a script based on his experience of adapting the book into a screenplay. Jonze signed to direct, and filming was finished in June 2001. Though the film is billed as an adaptation of The Orchid Thief, its primary narrative focus is Charlie Kaufman's struggle to adapt The Orchid Thief into a film, while dramatizing the events of the book in parallel. Adaptation also adds a number of fictitious elements, including Kaufman's twin brother (also credited as a writer for the film) and a romance between Orlean and Laroche, and culminates in completely invented events including fictional versions of Orlean and Laroche three years after the events related in The Orchid Thief.|$|E
5|$|Grappling {{with family}} challenges, Vonnegut {{continued}} to write, publishing novels vastly dissimilar {{in terms of}} plot. The Sirens of Titan (1959) features a Martian invasion of Earth, as experienced by a bored billionaire, Malachi Constant. He meets Winston Rumfoord, an aristocratic space traveler, who is virtually omniscient but stuck in a time warp {{that allows him to}} appear on Earth every 59 days. The billionaire learns that his actions and the events of all of history are determined by a race of robotic aliens from the planet Tralfamadore, who need a replacement part that can only be produced by an advanced civilization in order to repair their spaceship and return home—human history has been manipulated to produce it. Some human structures, such as the Kremlin, are coded signals from the aliens to their ship as to how long it may expect to wait for the repair to take place. Reviewers were uncertain what <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book, with one comparing it to Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann.|$|E
5|$|The {{band members}} all {{responded to this}} {{production}} method differently, with Iwadera and Kusakari finding the approach the easiest. Okazaki and Ejima both had trouble adopting this method. Okazaki was very anxious about her ability to create demos, having never used music software before, and not even owning a computer before moving to Tokyo. Yamaguchi bought her an iBook to help her with the process. Ejima found difficulty in recording demos due {{to the problem of}} recording drums at home for sound sampling. As a result, he learnt how to play the guitar. In June, the band were creating songs on a daily basis, and in August were still in the pre-production stages of the album. The album was created at Yamaguchi's apartment in Noborito in Kawasaki, Kanagawa, which became a meeting place for all of the band members for the album. In total, around thirty demo compositions were produced for the album. This method of song production also led to Yamaguchi being able <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album as a whole, as opposed to their methods on Go to the Future and Night Fishing, in which each song was thought of in its own individual context.|$|E

25|$|The central {{problem of}} Diophantine {{geometry}} {{is to determine}} when a Diophantine equation has solutions, and if it does, how many. The approach taken is <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solutions of an equation as a geometric object.|$|E

25|$|It is also {{possible}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bricard octahedron as a mechanical linkage consisting of the twelve edges, connected by flexible joints at the vertices, without the faces. Omitting the faces eliminates the self-crossings for many (but not all) positions of these octahedra. The resulting kinematic chain has one degree of freedom of motion, {{the same as the}} polyhedron from which it is derived.|$|E
25|$|It {{was thought}} that commanders might be tempted <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Armadillo as a mobile pillbox rather than any sort of tank or {{armoured}} car. To counter such a view, instructions emphasised its use as a mobile unit, not a static fort and {{it was to be}} reserved for the defence of the airfield and not given other tasks such as transporting ammunition or being driven off to find parachutists.|$|E

Whilst Kanade already has a brother, she likes <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protagonist as a brother, as he would often play games with her when she was a young child.|$|E

25|$|Strid began <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band's next album as {{a double}} album during a 2011 tour. He wanted to {{challenge}} himself, instead of releasing a single album after Wicher's departure. He {{also wanted to}} show that the band could release a great album with one of their main composers gone. He wrote two songs {{by the end of the}} year, and began writing with the band in March 2012. Soilwork announced they would begin recording August 23, 2012.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, a {{concrete}} category is a category that {{is equipped with}} a faithful functor to the category of sets. This functor makes it possible <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> objects of the category as sets with additional structure, and of its morphisms as structure-preserving functions. Many important categories have obvious interpretations as concrete categories, for example the category of topological spaces and the category of groups, and trivially also the category of sets itself. On the other hand, the homotopy category of topological spaces is not concretizable, i.e. it does not admit a faithful functor to the category of sets.|$|E
25|$|Another way <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{proof is}} that B, empty or non-empty, {{is always in}} the power set of A. For f to be onto, some element of A must map to B. But {{that leads to a}} {{contradict}}ion: no element of B can map to B because that would contradict the criterion of membership in B, thus the element mapping to B must not be an element of B meaning that it satisfies the criterion for membership in B, another contradiction. So the assumption that an element of A maps to B must be false; and f cannot be onto.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advancing wave of depolarisation as a dipole {{with a head}} and a tail. The length of the refractory period and the time taken for the dipole to travel a certain distance—the propagation velocity—will determine whether such a circumstance will arise for re-entry to occur. Factors that promote re-entry would include a slow-propagation velocity, a short refractory period with a sufficient size of ring of conduction tissue. These would enable a dipole to reach an area that had been refractory and is now able to be depolarised with continuation of the wavefront.|$|E
25|$|The {{first law}} of {{thermodynamics}} is so general that its predictions cannot all be directly tested. In many properly conducted experiments {{it has been}} precisely supported, and never violated. Indeed, within its scope of applicability, the law is so reliably established, that, nowadays, rather than experiment being considered as testing the accuracy of the law, it is more practical and realistic <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law as testing the accuracy of experiment. An experimental result that seems to violate the law may be assumed to be inaccurate or wrongly conceived, for example due to failure to account for an important physical factor. Thus, some may regard it as a principle more abstract than a law.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the letter being {{addressed}} directly to D'Alembert, it is undoubtedly meant {{to have an effect}} on the general population. The work is famous for displaying Rousseau's charismatic rhetoric and digressive tendencies, all with his personal experience woven into the text. It may be considered to portray Rousseau's vanity, narcissism and biases, but the text could also be thought of more positively; as expressive, lyrical and austere. The Letter shows Rousseau's tendency <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> events in his own life as highly significant, as reflections of the larger social picture. An example is how the Letter itself is open and expressive in style, while the content of the Letter is about this openness.|$|E

25|$|Although {{reflection}} {{from the}} rings increases Saturn's brightness, {{they are not}} visible from Earth with unaided vision. In 1610, the year after Galileo Galilei turned a telescope to the sky, {{he became the first}} person to observe Saturn's rings, though he could not see them well enough to discern their true nature. In 1655, Christiaan Huygens {{was the first person to}} describe them as a disk surrounding Saturn. Although many people think of Saturn's rings as being made up of a series of tiny ringlets (a concept that goes back to Laplace), true gaps are few. It is more correct <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rings as an annular disk with concentric local maxima and minima in density and brightness. On the scale of the clumps within the rings there is much empty space.|$|E
25|$|One way <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Euclidean {{plane is}} {{as a set}} of points {{satisfying}} certain relationships, expressible in terms of distance and angle. For example, there are two fundamental operations (referred to as motions) on the plane. One is translation, which means a shifting of the plane so that every point is shifted in the same direction and by the same distance. The other is rotation about a fixed point in the plane, in which every point in the plane turns about that fixed point through the same angle. One of the basic tenets of Euclidean geometry is that two figures (usually considered as subsets) of the plane should be considered equivalent (congruent) if one can be transformed into the other by some sequence of translations, rotations and reflections (see below).|$|E
25|$|The {{second edition}} shows a {{stronger}} influence of Gray and the elegy form. Gray's The Bard influences the poem's discussion of Chatterton as a poet, the Elegy influences the poem's discussion of Chatterton's solitude, and The Progress of Poesy influences {{the discussion of}} Chatterton's youth. Like Gray's poetry, the poem relies heavily upon personification and Coleridge borrows phrases from Gray. Even Coleridge's Chatterton and Gray's Bard share a similar character that is only separated by the actual biographical events of Chatterton's life and death. However, the 1767 revision begins to drop Gray as an influence and substitutes Wordsworth in his place. Wordsworth's influence did not directly affect the poem, but instead caused Coleridge <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poem {{as part of his}} childhood poems and not part of his mature work. Although he did revise the work again for the 1803 edition, his estimation of the poem did not improve. It was not until 1829 that Coleridge began to identify himself with Chatterton again.|$|E
