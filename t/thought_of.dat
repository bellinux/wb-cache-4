40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Thoughts</b> <b>of</b> {{death are}} not {{regularly}} included in diagnostic instruments and rarely examined separately from <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> suicide. This exploratory study examined whether <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death and <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> suicide affect {{the course of}} late-life depressive disorders. METHODS: In 378 depressed older persons, <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death and <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> suicide were assessed using questions from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. After 2 [*]years, {{the presence of a}} DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of minor or major depression or dysthymia was assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology was administered every 6 [*]months up till 3 -year follow-up. RESULTS: Multinomial logistic regression showed that <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death as well as <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> suicide predicted double depression at follow-up (OR[*]=[*] 2. 14 [95 % CI: 1. 04 - 4. 40] and OR[*]=[*] 6. 47 [95 % CI: 2. 22 - 3. 02], respectively), compared with patients without these thoughts. Results became non-significant when adjusted for baseline depression severity (OR[*]=[*] 1. 17 [95 % CI: 0. 52 - 2. 63] and OR[*]=[*] 2. 57 [95 % CI: 0. 79 - 8. 84], respectively). Mixed linear models showed that severity of depression was lowest in the reference group, while symptoms decreased more over time in those with either <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death or suicide. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death or with <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> suicide were more severely depressed at baseline and follow-up, with the highest risk of being depressed at follow-up for patients with <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> suicide. These associations could be explained by baseline depression severity. The results suggest that <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death and <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> suicide are important risk markers in predicting the course of depression...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{indicate}} that while suppressing smoking thoughts increases subsequent smoking, {{it may have}} no impact on desire to smoke. However, previous research has examined suppression <b>of</b> general smoking <b>thoughts</b> rather than thoughts specifically related to desire to smoke. The present study investigated whether suppression <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire to smoke results in subsequently elevated ratings of desire to smoke. An experimental study examined the effects <b>of</b> suppressing <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire to smoke, versus expressing <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire to smoke, versus a control group thinking about anything, on ratings of desire to smoke and tobacco withdrawal symptoms at four time points (before manipulations, just after manipulations, 5 min after, 10 min after). In addition, effects <b>of</b> suppressing <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire to smoke on subsequent reports <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire to smoke were examined. Suppressing the <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire to smoke caused thought rebound (i. e., greater subsequent reports <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire to smoke). However, compared with control groups, this suppression did not elevate subsequent ratings of desire to smoke. Suppressing the <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire to smoke does not elevate subsequent ratings of this desire. Increased cigarette consumption following suppression <b>of</b> smoking <b>thoughts</b> may be mediated by mechanisms other than increased desire to smoke...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Background: In {{depressed}} persons, <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> {{death and}} suicide {{are assumed to}} represent different degrees of a construct: suicidality. However, this can be questioned in older persons facing physical and social losses. <b>Thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death in depressed older persons are hardly examined {{in the absence of}} suicidal ideation. Furthermore, most depression instruments do not discriminate suicidal ideation from <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death only. We examined whether determinants <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death differ from determinants of suicidal ideation in late life depression. Methods: Past month's <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death and suicidal ideation were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview in 378 depressed older persons (> 60 years of age). Multinomial logistic regression analyses adjusted for age and depression severity were used to identify socio-demographic, lifestyle, clinical and somatic determinants <b>of</b> past month's <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death, and suicidal ideation. Results: Compared with patients without <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death or suicide (n = 267), patients reporting <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death but no suicidal ideation (n = 74) were older (OR (95 % confidence interval) = 1. 04 (1. 00 - 1. 08)) and more severely depressed (OR = 1. 06 (1. 04 - 1. 08)), whereas patients with suicidal ideation (n = 37) were also more severely depressed (OR = 1. 09 (1. 06 - 1. 13)), but not older. This latter group was further characterized by more psychiatric comorbidity (dysthymia OR = 2. 28 (1. 08 - 4. 85)), panic disorder (OR = 2. 27 (1. 00 - 518)), at-risk alcohol use (OR = 4. 10 (1. 42 - 11. 90)), lifetime suicide attempts (OR = 3. 37 (1. 46 - 7. 75)), loneliness (OR = 1. 24 (1. 07 - 1. 43)), and recent life events (OR = 3. 14 (1. 48 - 6. 67)). Conclusions: In depressed older persons <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death and suicide differ in relevant demographic, social, and clinical characteristics, suggesting that the risks and consequences of the two conditions differ...|$|R
