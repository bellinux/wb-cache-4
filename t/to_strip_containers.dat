25|$|Some of {{the biggest}} battles in the {{container}} revolution were waged in Washington, D.C.. Intermodal shipping got a huge boost in the early 1970s, when carriers won permission to quote combined rail-ocean rates. Later, non-vessel-operating common carriers won a long court battle with a US Supreme Court decision against contracts that attempted to require that union labor be used for stuffing and <b>stripping</b> <b>containers</b> at off-pier locations.|$|R
2500|$|Longshoremen {{and related}} unions {{around the world}} {{struggled}} with this revolution in shipping goods. For example, by 1971 a clause in the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) contract stipulated {{that the work of}} [...] "stuffing" [...] (filling) or [...] "stripping" [...] (emptying) a container within 50 miles of a port must be done by ILA workers, or if not done by ILA, that the shipper needed to pay royalties and penalties to the ILA. Unions for truckers and consolidators argued that the ILA rules were not valid work preservation clauses, because the work of stuffing and <b>stripping</b> <b>containers</b> away from the pier had not traditionally been done by ILA members. In 1980 the Supreme Court of the United States heard this case and ruled against the ILA.|$|R
