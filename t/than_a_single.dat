5|$|Unlike most English public schools, Stonyhurst is {{organised}} horizontally by year groups (known as playrooms) {{rather than}} vertically by houses, although {{the girls are}} also split into junior and senior houses. Each playroom has an assigned playroom master, with each cohort moving through the playrooms, having a sequence of playroom masters (rather <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> housemaster).|$|E

5|$|Voters {{rejected}} {{efforts to}} have separate {{residential and commercial}} land-use districts in 1948, 1962, and 1993. Consequently, rather <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> central business district {{as the center of}} the city's employment, multiple districts have grown throughout the city in addition to downtown which include Uptown, TexasMedicalCenter, Midtown, GreenwayPlaza, Memorial City, Energy Corridor, Westchase, and Greenspoint.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} fixed {{structures}} can create structural colours, by mechanisms including diffraction gratings, selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres and deformed matrices. Structures can {{be far more}} elaborate <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> thin film: films can be stacked up to give strong iridescence, to combine two colours, or to balance out the inevitable change of colour with angle to give a more diffuse, less iridescent effect. Each mechanism offers a specific {{solution to the problem}} of creating a bright colour or combination of colours visible from different directions.|$|E
5|$|As a {{pervasive}} developmental disorder, Asperger syndrome is distinguished by {{a pattern of}} symptoms rather <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language. Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, restricted prosody, and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis. Suicidal behavior appears to occur at rates similar to those without ASD.|$|E

50|$|Shaw {{had more}} success as <b>a</b> doubles <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>singles</b> player. She {{never won a}} major tournament, but she reached the finals of both the ladies doubles and the mixed doubles, and twice {{made it to the}} semi-finals in the French Open. She played twice in the Australian Open semi-finals. She reached the quarter-finals at Wimbledon in 1972, playing with another Scot, Joyce Williams.|$|R

5|$|Brolgas are gregarious creatures; {{the basic}} social unit {{is a pair}} or small family group of {{about three or four}} birds, usually parents {{together}} with juvenile offspring, though some of such groups are unrelated. In the non-breeding season, they gather into large flocks, which appear to be many self-contained individual groups rather <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> social unit. Within the flock, families tend to remain separate and to coordinate their activities with one another rather than with the flock as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Danebury was {{abandoned}} around 100BC, {{in common with}} the trend across Britain for hill forts to fall out of use around that time. Once again, the east gate was burnt down, although this time it was not replaced. Most of the inhabitants deserted Danebury, and groups of bodies were disposed of in charnel pits. The site continued in use, but on a much smaller scale than before. Buildings were left to decay and the interior of the fort became used for grazing. By the start of the 1st centuryAD, the settlement of Danebury was probably nothing more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> farm.|$|E
5|$|Half of Minneapolis–Saint Paul {{residents}} work in {{the city}} where they live. Most residents drive cars, but 60% of the 160,000 people working downtown commute by means other <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> person per auto. Alternative transportation is encouraged. The Metropolitan Council's Metro Transit, which operates the light rail system and most of the city's buses, provides free travel vouchers through the Guaranteed Ride Home program to allay fears that commuters might otherwise be occasionally stranded if, for example, they work late hours.|$|E

30|$|Remark 2 In case of n > 21023, the {{computational}} load for generating an 80 -bit prime is less <b>than</b> for <b>a</b> <b>single</b> RSA decryption, and the {{computational load}} for the primality test of an 80 -bit prime is less <b>than</b> for <b>a</b> <b>single</b> RSA encryption with an 80 -bit exponent. Hence, our protocol is quite efficient in computation cost. Furthermore, if we exclude perfect forward secrecy from consideration, {{we need not}} to generate them in each session, this further improves the efficiency of our protocol.|$|R

5|$|He uses {{overlapping}} forms rather <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> form or distinct adjacent forms, {{which seems}} {{to create a more}} dynamic feel to the shallow space. However, since Lichtenstein does not uses shading or contrast, the monochromatic strokes with just bold black outlines are void of certain elements of depth. Big Painting No. 6 and Yellow and Green Brushstrokes go one step further in terms of canvas size and dynamic activity that was presented earlier in Little Big Painting.|$|E
5|$|Monsanto {{developed}} patents for {{genetically modified}} soybeans that were resistant to glyphosate-based herbicides. When farmers sprayed the modified soybeans with the glyphosate herbicide Roundup, the modified soybeans would survive while competing plants (weeds) would be killed. Monsanto sold these soybeans under a limited-use license that prohibited the farmer-buyer {{from using the}} seeds for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> season or from saving any seed produced from the crop for replanting.|$|E
5|$|Opened {{as part of}} {{an attempt}} to {{encourage}} holiday traffic on the line, the halt primarily served golfers at the nearby Royal Cromer Golf Club. The station facilities were very basic, consisting of no more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> wooden platform, which cost £170 to build, two wooden benches and running in board together with the obligatory oil lamps. No shelter was provided for passengers and the platform was constructed of sleepers and supported by wooden trestles.|$|E
