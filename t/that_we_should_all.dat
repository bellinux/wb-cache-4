500|$|As {{a result}} of his efforts, he is {{considered}} as [...] "one of the greatest wartime heroes". In the foreword to the book The Auschwitz Volunteer: Beyond Bravery, Michael Schudrich, the Chief Rabbi of Poland, wrote as follows: [...] "When God created the human being, God had in mind <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> be like Captain Witold Pilecki, of blessed memory." [...] In the introduction to that book Norman Davies, a British historian, wrote: [...] "If there was an Allied hero who deserved to be remembered and celebrated, this was a person with few peers." [...] At the commemoration event of International Holocaust Remembrance Day held in the US Holocaust Memorial Museum on 27 January 2013 Ryszard Schnepf, the Polish Ambassador to the US, described Pilecki as a [...] "diamond among Poland's heroes" [...] and [...] "the highest example of Polish patriotism".|$|E
2500|$|By contrast, on December 9, 2005, Linda Owens, Albert Owens' widow, {{issued a}} {{statement}} in support of Williams’ efforts {{to bring an end}} to gang violence and his call for peace between gangs: [...] "I, Linda Owens want to build upon Mr. Williams' peace initiative. I invite Mr. Williams to join me in sending a message to all communities <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> unite in peace. This position of peace would honor my husband's memory and Mr. Williams' work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gingrich {{has been}} very {{critical}} of Obama's handling {{of the crisis in}} Egypt, and has warned of the possibility that Egypt might [...] "go the way of Iran". Gingrich said, [...] "I think this is a period of tremendous challenge and is a sign of the general failure of our strategy of not dealing with radical Islamists and not being honest and aggressive of what's going on around the world." [...] Gingrich also said that the Obama administration had failed to take the Middle East seriously and that Obama's 2009 speech in Cairo designed to improve relations with the Muslim world was a mistake. Gingrich said, [...] "The president went to Cairo and gave his famous speech in which he explained <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> be friends together because we're all the same people doing the same things and there are no differences between us. Well, I {{think there are a lot}} of differences between the Muslim Brotherhood and the rest of us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] exclaimed Harry, [...] "your {{advice is}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> by <b>all</b> means be happy, {{and if we}} can't be happy, be as happy as <b>we</b> can. Is <b>that</b> it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{came just}} to see me. She came--after what had passed at your house--so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should,</b> after <b>all,</b> at last meet. The impulse seemed to me exquisite, {{and that was the}} way I took it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Arrested, {{it might}} be, in his general assurance, Hugh {{wondered}} and smiled. [...] "Mine--collectors? Oh, I'm afraid I haven't any--to speak of. Only it {{has seemed to}} me for a long time," [...] he added, [...] "that on <b>that</b> head <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> feel together." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{were not}} best <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> think alike; it is [...] {{difference}} of opinion that makes horse races. --Pudd'nhead [...] Wilson's Calendar ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think there}} must be some mistake," [...] {{answered}} Marais quietly, [...] "since Hernan cannot have wished <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> be put to death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{it is not}} fancy," [...] Mr. Welch replied, [...] "and I do {{not think}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> be deceived, it is an attack upon Gloucester." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it possible?" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "My sister, {{my beloved}} sister, I {{have tried to}} keep my brain cool in many trials. But I feel, as it were, as if life were too much for me. You counsel me to <b>that</b> which <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> repent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Strange, Watson, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> see tracks <b>all</b> {{along our}} line, but never a cow {{on the whole}} moor. Very strange, Watson, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The Spaniard flung {{his arms}} up when Austin {{translated}} this. [...] "Who knows?" [...] he said. [...] "I am only an ignorant sailorman, and cannot tell; {{but when we}} came here the SeÃ±or Austin promised us <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have <b>all</b> <b>that</b> was reasonable. It is not fitting that men should die and nothing be done to save them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What!" [...] cried Kate, [...] "would you {{be willing}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> sail away and leave poor Ben Greenway in this place by himself among these cruel pirates?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, I quite {{agree with}} you. Two parties {{are apt to}} be a tie upon each other. I think that your plan <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> meet at Martigny is the wisest.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That {{is exactly}} why I want you to come. The idea is to take no notice {{of the events of}} yesterday, and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> go about as if nothing had happened.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{shall be}} {{exceedingly}} glad, Mr. Laverick," [...] he said dryly, [...] "to {{get rid of}} your packet. Your instructions were <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> disregard <b>all</b> orders to hand it over to any person whatsoever, and I may {{say that they have}} been strictly adhered to. We have, however, had two applications in your name this morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rely upon it, she {{shall be}} taken tender care of. If {{you like to}} give me your address abroad, I will write {{to let you know}} how we get on. It is not fair <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have <b>all</b> the {{pleasure}} of her salvation to ourselves. And besides, I want to make believe that I am doing something for you as well as for Mirah." ...|$|R
60|$|In this distress, {{the wind}} still blowing very hard, {{one of our}} men {{early in the morning}} cried out, Land! and we had no sooner run out of the cabin to look out in hopes of seeing {{whereabouts}} in the world we were, but the ship struck upon a sand, and in a moment, her motion being so stopped, the sea broke over her in such a manner, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> expected <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> have perished immediately; and we were immediately driven into our close quarters to shelter us from the very foam and spray of the sea.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] he said, leaning {{upon the}} mantelshelf and {{looking down at}} the gas flames, [...] "I've never thought <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> have to live in this crowded house for long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Right-o, old companion, {{just as you}} say. I say, I {{was just}} going to suggest to Mr. Connolly <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> go up to my suite and talk this {{business}} over quietly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes;--we {{are all in}} {{the hands}} of God. But it is the Lord's {{intention}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> look out for ourselves, and {{do the best we can}} to avoid injustice, and cruelty, and,--and--robbery." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis written <b>that</b> <b>we</b> women <b>should</b> leave <b>all</b> {{to follow}} our husband. I think our {{courtship}} {{was not very}} long, dear Martin!" [...] said the matron, laying {{her hand on her}} husband's arm.|$|R
30|$|The {{proof of}} Theorem  1.1 is mainly {{based on a}} {{critical}} Sobolev inequality of logarithmic type which was recently proved by Huang-Wang [12] and is originally due to Brezis-Wainger [21]. The main difficulty compared with [12] is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> bound <b>all</b> the desired estimates without the restriction {{on the size of}} the domain, especially that the Poincaré inequality is not the same from the bounded domain to the whole spaces.|$|R
60|$|Reconnoissances {{should be}} made in front of every corps and {{advances}} made to advantageous positions by regular approaches. To aid the expedition under General Hunter it is necessary <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> detain <b>all</b> the army now with Lee until the former gets {{well on his way}} to Lynchburg. To do this effectually it will be better to keep the enemy out of the intrenchments of Richmond than to have them go back there.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] said he, [...] "it {{really would}} be a good thing <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> go over the house {{together}} and make certain that this rather erratic burglar did not, after all, carry anything away with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{may not be}} loosed {{on earth}} or in heaven," [...] replied Emlyn solemnly, [...] "yet perchance the sword can cut it. Sir Christopher, I think <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> do well to travel as soon as may be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do you know, Helen,' said Elizabeth, who {{had been}} {{pursuing}} her own thoughts, rather than listening to her sister's words, 'I do believe <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> have been more like her if she had lived; at least, I am sure I should.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Captain Mallett. I {{thought of}} him when those fellows in the mosque were keeping such a heavy fire upon us as we were waiting {{to get into the}} Secunderbagh. It seemed to me that his chance of ever getting his money was not worth much. How the bullets did whizz about! I felt sure <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be <b>all</b> mown down before we could get under the shelter of the wall.|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{see that}} you are not able to {{restrain}} the policy of agitation over inter-provincial boundaries. It is easy to yield to current pressure of opinion {{and it is difficult to}} impose on enthusiastic people any policy of restraint. But I earnestly plead <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> do <b>all</b> <b>we</b> can to prevent ill-will from hardening into a chronic disorder. We have enough ill-will and prejudice to cope with. Must we hasten to create further fissiparous forces?" ...|$|R
40|$|The general {{principle}} {{for the collection}} development of the library is "Completeness for Chinese publications and quality for foreign publications", which means <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> collect <b>all</b> Chinese publications and best foreign publications. NLC is to become an international center of Chinese publications and all publications on China and the Chinese, and plan to further develop its traditional characteristics in Chinese ancient books, Orientalia, history of arts, archeology, Dunhuang scrolls, natural history, genealogy, local chronicles and yearbooks...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{must have}} been so very ill in Italy, {{about the same time}} as poor Ferdinand was at Armine. Only think, how odd you should both have been so ill about the same time, and now <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> be so intimate!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I am much {{obliged to}} you for your advice, for I am very ignorant myself, and hate {{anything}} to do with money. I go back to first principles, and believe <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> be better without it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Am I Montezuma, {{that you}} ask me? I swore to defend this {{city to the}} last,' he {{answered}} hoarsely, 'and, for my part, I will defend it. Better <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> die, than that we should fall living {{into the hands of}} the Teules.' ...|$|E
5000|$|In a 1763 essay, Voltaire {{supported}} the toleration of other religions and ethnicities: [...] "It {{does not require}} great art, or magnificently trained eloquence, to prove that Christians should tolerate each other. I, however, am going further: I say <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> regard <b>all</b> men as our brothers. What? The Turk my brother? The Chinaman my brother? The Jew? The Siam? Yes, without doubt; are we not all children of the same father and creatures of the same God?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll be {{with you}} in a minute, Massan.--Then, Frank, we'll expect an account of your journey to-night. Eda is very anxious <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be told <b>all</b> about your {{wonderful}} adventures in the mountains. Meanwhile I shall be off to look after the men." ...|$|R
40|$|T The {{question}} {{is no longer}} if the Internet {{can be used to}} transform learning in new and powerful ways. The Commission has found that it can. Nor is the question <b>should</b> <b>we</b> invest the time, the energy, and the money necessary to fulfill its promise in defining and shaping new learning opportunity. The Commission believes <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should.</b> <b>We</b> <b>all</b> have a role to play. It is time we collectively move the power of the Internet for learning from promise to practice. his is a summary statement taken from a report by the Web-based Education Commission to the President and the Congress of the United States, "The Power of the Internet for Learning: Moving from Promise to Practice, " which was released in December 2000. This is a rather long statement and citation—sorry about that—but this was a significant report that had some pretty serious ramifications...|$|R
