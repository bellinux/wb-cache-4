5|$|In {{the ruins}} of homeworld of the Daleks, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> {{approached}} by a woman, who requests his help in freeing her daughter from a Dalek prison. The woman is revealed to be a humanoid “Dalek puppet.” <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> teleported to a spaceship housing the Parliament of the Daleks. Onboard are a now divorced Amy and Rory, who have been similarly kidnapped from present-day Earth. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> surprised when the Daleks ask him for help.|$|E
5|$|The Ninth Doctor is an {{incarnation}} of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television programme Doctor Who. He is portrayed by Christopher Eccleston during the first series of the show's revival in 2005. Within the programme's narrative, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> a time travelling, humanoid alien from a race known as the Time Lords. When <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> critically injured, he can regenerate his body but in doing so gains a new physical appearance and with it, a distinct new personality.|$|E
5|$|After {{stepping}} out of the TARDIS in modern-day Colchester, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> blown off his feet by a blast of air, and the TARDIS, Amy still inside, dematerialises into the time vortex and refuses to rematerialise. With Amy's help, the Doctor tracks the disturbance to the second floor of a house. The Doctor opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant, Craig Owens, in order to determine what is present on the second floor without alerting whatever it is to his Time Lord nature. Neither Craig nor the Doctor are aware that people are being lured off the street to the second floor flat and never leaving again, but <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from the second floor.|$|E
5000|$|The Court of Appeal {{held that}} <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>was</b> indeed a {{servant of the}} {{hospital}} and the Ministry was vicariously liable, because <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>was</b> integrated into <b>the</b> health organisation. Denning LJ said, ...|$|R

50|$|In 1964, {{a doctor}} {{performed}} sex reassignment surgical operations on three men. The patients {{were arrested for}} prostitution. <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>was</b> prosecuted for violating eugenics laws. <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>was</b> found guilty, and the operations were considered unjustified, {{as they had been}} performed without adequate diagnoses of gender identity disorder.|$|R
5|$|At the house, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> {{surprised}} by Caecilius's daughter Evelina, {{who seems to}} have extrasensory perception (ESP) and knows personal details about the Doctor and Donna. They are interrupted by the local augur, Lucius Petrus Dextrus, who has arrived to collect a sculpture he commissioned. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> intrigued by the sculpture, which resembles a segment of an oversized circuit board. Lucius Petrus reveals that he also has powerful ESP and calls out the name of the Doctor's home planet, Gallifrey. The Doctor wishes {{to learn more about the}} sculptures and enlists Caecilius's son Quintus to help him break into Lucius Petrus' house. Inside, the Doctor deduces that the circuits will make an energy converter, but he is caught by Lucius Petrus. The two escape, but Lucius Petrus beckons a large stone creature to attack and kill them. The stone creature appears in Caecilius's house and attacks them, but Quintus saves them by dousing the creature in water and killing it. In the confusion, the Sisterhood kidnap Donna, and the Doctor sets off to rescue her. He meets the high priestess of the Sisterhood, who is revealed to be transforming into a stone creature. The Doctor discovers that they are being controlled by the Pyroviles, volcanic creatures whose home planet of Pyrovilia was lost. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> attacked by the Sisterhood, but he escapes with Donna into an underground tunnel that leads into the heart of Mount Vesuvius.|$|E
5|$|Convinced of Barclay's claims, the Doctor {{prepares to}} destroy the ship when Chakotay (Robert Beltran) arrives and gives an {{alternative}} story: <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> indeed the Voyager EMH, but his program is stuck in the malfunctioning holodeck. The crew is trying to extricate his program so he only needs to wait it out; if he destroys the ship as Barclay suggests, it will prematurely end {{the program and the}} Doctor will be lost. Even though Barclay introduces Kes (Jennifer Lien) as Zimmerman's wife, the Doctor finally opts to believe in his holographic existence. The simulation ends and the Doctor finds himself on the holodeck; Chakotay's story was true and <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> safely returned to sickbay.|$|E
5|$|The {{absolute}} state paternalism of totalitarian regimes, which naturally {{gives rise}} to the dominance of the archaic paternalistic ethical concept in medical practice. Professional consciousness of <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>is</b> based on the almost absolute right to make decisions without the patient's consent (i.e. there is disregard for the principle of informed consent to treatment or withdrawal from it).|$|E
60|$|Everybody shrieked with laughter. <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>was</b> quite helpless.|$|R
5000|$|While not {{understanding}} {{the specifics of}} what <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>was</b> doing or any of his explanations, Benton always took <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> at his word and trusted him implicitly. Benton was loyal, {{not just to the}} rank but also to the people he worked with, and was willing to disobey orders to help them (in Invasion of the Dinosaurs, he encouraged <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> to knock him out and [...] "escape" [...] after <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>was</b> falsely accused). He even willingly offers himself as a test subject for <b>the</b> <b>Doctor's</b> psychic-scanner, remarking that unlike <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> he <b>is</b> expendable (Planet of the Spiders).|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>was</b> {{overwhelmed}} {{at first}} by this fierce, hissing vehemence.|$|R
5|$|The {{characters}} of Dr. Mario and the viruses appeared in print media numerous times: Valiant published {{a volume of}} Nintendo Comics Systems entitled <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>Is</b> In... Over His Head, Dr. Mario also makes a brief appearance in {{the first volume of}} Super Mario-Kun, and the viruses also appear at the end of Super Mario Adventures.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> a pacifist {{and did not}} use {{the guns}} {{commonly}} found in video games, The Adventure Games utilised a more strategy and puzzle-based gameplay. Much of the first game was based around stealth, exploration, and puzzle-solving. The Doctor was also equipped with his sonic screwdriver, but as this was often used as a skeleton key in the show the game employs the solving of puzzles to advance instead of simply using the screwdriver.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, {{the newly}} {{regenerated}} Doctor (Matt Smith) crashes {{his time and}} space machine, the TARDIS, into the small English village of Leadworth, where he meets a young Scottish girl named Amelia Pond (Caitlin Blackwood). <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> forced to leave, but promises Amelia he will return in five minutes. However, he arrives twelve years late and is confronted by the grown-up Amelia, now known as Amy (Karen Gillan), who does not trust him. He attempts to gain her trust to help return the shape-shifting alien Prisoner Zero to the galactic police, the Atraxi, before they destroy the planet.|$|E

25|$|As {{with his}} predecessor, all <b>the</b> Second <b>Doctor's</b> {{original}} episodes <b>were</b> in black-and-white. Later guest appearances in <b>The</b> Three <b>Doctors,</b> <b>The</b> Five <b>Doctors</b> and <b>The</b> Two <b>Doctors</b> <b>were</b> in colour. However, Troughton's reign as <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>was</b> more notable for what {{does not exist}} than for what does, {{as many of the}} episodes featuring <b>the</b> Second <b>Doctor</b> <b>were</b> junked by <b>the</b> BBC; a full list of incomplete Doctor Who serials shows how many of these episodes are missing from the BBC Archives.|$|R
60|$|The next morning, as Ned <b>was</b> at breakfast, <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>was</b> announced.|$|R
5|$|On 23 March 2013, BBC {{released}} a short prequel video to the episode, written by Steven Moffat. In the prequel, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> {{sitting at the}} swings of a children's playground when he meets a little girl. They talk about losing things, and the Doctor states that he has lost someone twice and he hopes {{he might be able}} to find her again. The girl tells him that, when she loses something, she goes to a quiet place for a think, and then can remember where she put it. As the girl leaves, it is revealed that she is Clara Oswald.|$|E
5|$|Physicians: Medical care is {{traditionally}} focused on curing and healing the patient. For many, hospice {{care is not}} seen as the true practice of medicine. Physicians face a persistent social stigma in that hospice is mistaken as giving up on a patient, rather than committing to palliation. Additionally, and although this perception has been changing, when thinking of hospice <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>is</b> often focused on patients with cancer and not {{many of the other}} terminal diseases which qualify for hospice care.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{leaves on}} his own to locate the Cybermen at the store but Craig shortly follows, {{bringing}} Alfie along. The Doctor finds the spaceship actually sits below the store, underground, accessed by a tunnel from a changing room. The ship has been slowly siphoning energy from the store's power lines, reactivating its crew. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> captured by the Cybermen, who tell him that their ship crashed long ago but, with this new energy, will soon have enough power to convert the human race.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>was</b> nonplussed for a moment. Then he {{gathered}} himself together.|$|R
50|$|In 1966, a heart surgeon became <b>the</b> <b>Doctor.</b> After {{acquiring}} his powers, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> slaughtered <b>the</b> {{entire population}} of three countries (in alphabetical order) and fell asleep after drinking every bottle of Dom Pérignon in existence at <b>the</b> time. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>was</b> defeated when every active superhero on Earth joined forces to defeat him. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>was</b> stripped of his powers and imprisoned in a pocket dimension 20 million years in the past.|$|R

5|$|The Doctor, River, Amy, and Rory {{suddenly}} {{find themselves}} near the TARDIS in a New York graveyard back in 2012, Rory's plan having worked. As the four prepare to depart, Rory catches {{sight of a}} tombstone with his name on it. He is then touched by a surviving, albeit weakened, Angel and sent into the past. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> unable to take the TARDIS back to get him, due to the paradox Rory and Amy created. Amy refuses to be parted from Rory and willingly allows herself to be touched by the same Angel {{in the hopes of}} being sent back to the same time as he was. Her name then appears along with Rory's on the tombstone. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> distraught, but River reminds him that while their fates are now sealed, Amy likely published the Melody Malone book in the past and may have left him a message. The Doctor races back to where they had their picnic and recovers the final page, finding the afterword written by Amy to him. Amy explains that she and Rory lived out a good and happy life for themselves, and asks the Doctor to visit her childhood self to assure her that he will come back for her to take her on amazing journeys. The episode ends with a young Amelia Pond sitting in her back garden, then looking up and smiling as the TARDIS engines are heard.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} is introduced {{as a boy}} genius from the year 2012 who attracts {{the attention of the}} Doctor's traveling companion Rose after she and the Doctor meet him in his place of work. Despite Rose's willingness to accept Adam as a fellow traveller, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> skeptical. After Adam attempts to use information from the future for his own gain he throws Adam out of his time machine, the TARDIS. This was the first example of the Doctor forcing a companion to leave because of negative behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{featured}} alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) and {{his companions}} Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) visiting the Wild West, where they encounter a town which is {{cut off from the}} rest of the frontier until they hand over Kahler-Jex, an alien doctor, to a cyborg called the Gunslinger. However, the Gunslinger is a product of experiments by Jex to win a civil war on his planet, and <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> unsure of what is the right thing to do.|$|E

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>was</b> terribly agitated. His {{hands were}} shaking like leaves in the wind.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>was</b> {{obliged to}} {{acknowledge}} that there did seem to be some improvement.|$|R
5|$|The episode {{features}} the alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) being {{captured by the}} Daleks, along with his companions Amy (Karen Gillan) and Rory (Arthur Darvill), who are about to divorce. They are sent by the Daleks to the Asylum, a planet where insane Daleks are exiled, to enable the Asylum to be destroyed before the insane Daleks can escape. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> helped along the way by Oswin Oswald (Jenna-Louise Coleman), a woman whose spaceship had crashed on the planet {{a year ago and}} has been trapped there since then.|$|E
5|$|The finale's {{narrative}} brings {{closure to}} several prominent story arcs created during Davies' tenure as show runner. In the episode, contemporary Earth and twenty-six other planets are stolen by the Daleks, aided by their megalomaniacal creator Davros and a shattered but precognitive Dalek Caan. As the Doctor (David Tennant) and his companion Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) {{try to find}} Earth, his previous companions Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman), Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen), and Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) convene to contact him and mount a defence against the Daleks. In the episode's climax, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> shot by a Dalek and begins to regenerate.|$|E
5|$|As the Doctor and {{geologist}} Nasreen Chaudhry arrive by TARDIS in {{the massive}} Silurian underground civilisation, they are captured and taken to the Silurian doctor, Malohkeh. The Silurians' hostility is increased when the Doctor recalls his previous meeting with a similar race of reptilian humanoids which were destroyed by humans, {{a reference to the}} Third Doctor in Doctor Who and the Silurians. Meanwhile, Amy and Mo escape from Malokeh's experimentation and Mo discovers his son, Elliot, sedated in a chamber and under observation. When Malokeh realises <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> not human, the leader of the Silurian warrior caste, Restac, insists both the Doctor and Nasreen be executed and escorts them to a Silurian court; though Amy and Mo interrupt the trial with stolen weapons, they too are captured. Eldane, Restac's superior, is called in by Malohkeh and demands a halt to the hostilities.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>was</b> very arbitrary, {{and would}} hear {{neither of them}} on this subject.|$|R
60|$|And at this {{remarkable}} falsehood the suspicions of <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>were</b> at once quadrupled.|$|R
60|$|But <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>was</b> still scrutinising <b>the</b> little pagan, {{his eyebrows}} knotted and uplifted.|$|R
