5|$|The most {{challenging}} {{stage of the}} takeoff is carrying the speed from the inrun with sufficient height over the 'knoll', and achieving the correct trajectory down the hill. The knoll is the highest point of the hill itself, from which it begins <b>to</b> <b>slope</b> downwards. On modern ski flying hills the table is placed considerably far back from the knoll, so as to reduce the steepness of the flight curve. A skilled athlete is able to aggressively 'snap' into the transition so as to clear the knoll with ease, thereby allowing them to focus completely on using their specialised aerodynamic flying technique to maximise distance further down the hill. Athletes of the highest skill level can consistently compensate for any lack of inrun speed with perfect timing {{off the table and}} an excellent transition.|$|E

25|$|The Sports deck (topmost) {{was mostly}} an outside {{recreation}} area. Two walkways in the aft section abutted the swimming pools {{on the deck}} below. The section closest to the bow lay atop the ship's bridge. Most of the sports deck was a spacious rooftop space. Lido deck constituted the pool area {{of the ship and}} also housed the bridge closer to the bow. There were two nearly oval-shaped swimming pools surrounded by a spacious lido area. Ahead of the lido section and behind the officers' quarters aft of the wheelhouse was a small buffet. The interior portion of the deck continued around the lido area via glass-enclosed walkways. These walkways were just inboard of the ship's lifeboats. Boat deck contained most of the first class cabins and there were 34 that were especially luxurious. The Card Room and Reading Room were aft of the passenger accommodations. A teak promenade encircled the entirety of Boat Deck, designed <b>to</b> <b>slope</b> towards its amidships section as a way to compensate for the swaying of the vessel.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the best}} known {{features}} of Emmanuel Episcopal Church is a mistake. [...] The lower section of the side wall is intended <b>to</b> <b>slope</b> inward as it rises (this is called battering). [...] The upper wall outward slope started to take place shortly after construction. [...] Richardson died a month after the church's dedication so his former employees, Longfellow, Alden & Harlow, were hired but they were unsuccessful in pinpointing the cause. [...] However, when the firm added the parish house {{to the far side of}} the church, the slope stopped increasing.|$|E
2500|$|Eventually {{the ridge}} they were {{straddling}} began <b>to</b> <b>slope</b> downwards. They {{had at last}} reached, or had passed, the summit. It was 3 p.m., and through swirling cloud they glimpsed another razor-sharp ice ridge descending eastwards down to a col before curving gracefully upwards towards the Dome du Gouter. Grove recalled: [...] "I thought it the most terrific [...] thing I had ever seen in the Alps, but I am perfectly aware that a highly exaggerated impression {{is likely to be}} received of a ridge seen by half-frozen men {{in the middle of a}} tremendous storm, from the summit of a virgin peak".|$|E
50|$|Here {{is another}} {{geometric}} point of view. Draw the unit circle, and let P {{be the point}} (&minus;1, 0). A line through P (except the vertical line) is determined by its slope. Furthermore, each of the lines (except the vertical line) intersects the unit circle in exactly two points, {{one of which is}} P. This determines a function from points on the unit circle <b>to</b> <b>slopes.</b> The trigonometric functions determine a function from angles to points on the unit circle, and by combining these two functions we have a function from angles <b>to</b> <b>slopes.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{artillery}} and mortars began inflicting casualties on Australians, who had nothing {{with which to}} counter the indirect fires ranging in on them. Nevertheless, they fought back with machine fire and rolled grenades down <b>to</b> <b>slope</b> towards the attacking Japanese. After about an hour of close quarters fighting, including hand-to-hand combat, the engagement ended in the Australians withdrawing from the village after Owen died from wounds received while moving amongst his troops to buoy their morale as the threat of encirclement grew. With indirect fire now along their withdrawal route, the Australians fell back {{under the cover of}} a thick fog and were subsequently led back to Deniki under the command of Major William Watson of the PIB, with the majority arriving around sunrise on 29 July.|$|E

2500|$|The Pike's {{fuselage}} was a steel-tube structure, rectangular {{in cross-section}} and again fabric covered. [...] It had a 450hp (336kW) Napier Lion water-cooled engine driving a two-bladed propeller. [...] There {{was a small}} radiator mounted vertically in the nose immediately behind the propeller, with another inclined below. [...] This arrangement allowed the upper surface of the forward fuselage <b>to</b> <b>slope</b> downwards steeply from the pilot's cockpit at the wing leading edge, giving him the good forward view essential for deck landings. [...] The gunner's cockpit was aft, but ahead of the wing trailing edge. The fin and horn-balanced rudder together were large and rounded, the latter extending to the fuselage bottom between split, balanced elevators hinged to an upper fuselage mounted tailplane. A small V-braced tailskid was fixed under the tail.|$|E

2500|$|There was a {{clear view}} northwards from the fort over the Ailette, along the lower edge of {{the west side of}} the Forest of Coucy and past the village of Brancourt; to the east were two groups of hills round Anizy, on the north bank of the Ailette. Laon was about [...] distant and visible at the end of the valley of the Ardon, which joins the Ailette north of Chavignon. Further east, beyond the [...] reservoir, was the hilltop village of Monampteuil. East of the reservoir, the valley of the Upper Ailette was visible as far as the Troyon–Laon road. South of Fort de la Malmaison, in the centre of the plateau closer to the French lines, lay the huge Bohery Quarry, where the ground began <b>to</b> <b>slope</b> steeply down towards the Aisne valley.

2500|$|The {{striped hyena}} has a fairly massive, but short torso set on long legs. The hind legs are {{significantly}} {{shorter than the}} forelimbs, thus causing the back <b>to</b> <b>slope</b> downwards. The legs are relatively thin and weak, with the forelegs being bent at the carpal region. The neck is thick, long and largely immobile, while the head is heavy and massive with a shortened facial region. The eyes are small, while the sharply pointed ears are very large, broad and set high on the head. Like all hyenas, the striped hyena has bulky pads on its paws, as well as blunt but powerful claws. The tail is short and the terminal hairs do not descend below the achilles tendon. The striped hyena lacks the enlarged clitoris and false scrotal sack noted in the female genitalia of the spotted hyena. The female has 3 pairs of nipples. Adult weight can range from , averaging at about [...] Body length can range from , not counting a tail of , and shoulder height is between [...] The male has a large pouch of naked skin located at the anal opening. Large anal glands open into it from above the anus. Several sebaceous glands are present between the openings of the anal glands and above them. The anus can be everted up to a length of 5cm, and is everted during social interaction and mating. When attacked, the striped hyena everts its rectum and sprays a pungent smelling liquid from its anal glands. Its eyesight is acute, though its senses of smell and hearing are weak.|$|E
2500|$|The 60hp Schneider {{gasoline}} engine and its radiator {{are located in}} the front part of the tank, to the immediate left of the driver. The four cylinder, 135×170 9753 cc, engine is of a type specially constructed for the Schneider CA. It attains its maximum output of sixty horsepower at a thousand rpm. The three forward speeds gearbox, as well as the differentials, which can be engaged by brakes on the half shafts to steer the tank, are all located on the rear axle. They are linked to the engine in the front by a driveshaft and a primary clutch. A secondary clutch is coupled to each sprocket and can be decoupled for a tight turn. The main clutch and the main brakes can be engaged by pedals, the throttle by a handle. By means of a reverse device the three gears can also be applied to drive backwards. Steering was generally very tiring and there was a tendency to jump out of gear when the clutch was engaged too forcefully. The tank's official top speed is only 8.1km/h. Practical terrain speed was even lower at two to four km/h. The first gear at 1000 rpm equals a speed of 2km/h, the second of 3.95km/h, the third of 6.75km/h. At two kilometres per hour the vehicle can climb a slope of 55%. The capacity to overcome obstacles, limited to a parapet of about eighty centimetres, is improved by two short climbing tails, fitted to the left and right of the lower hull rear. The lower profile of the tails is curved, allowing the vehicle to gradually raise itself above a trench floor, until its centre of gravity shifts over the edge causing its hull to suddenly tumble forward. [...] The trench-crossing capacity is about 175 centimetres. The wading capacity is eighty centimetres. Two fuel gravity-feed reservoirs placed above the engine below the right front roof and nose plate, have a total capacity of 145 litres, and allow for a practical range of about fifty kilometres, though the official range is eighty kilometres. The suspension consists of seven double road wheels attached to two bogies, the one in front carrying three, the other four. The rear bogie is sprung by two vertical coil springs, the front one larger than the rear one. [...] The front bogies of the left and the right, each sprung by a vertical coil of narrow diameter, are connected to each other by means of a yoke-like transverse beam, itself attached to the hull bottom by two wide vertical coils springs, diminishing rolling and tilt when crossing rough terrain. Ground clearance is forty-one centimetres. There are five small return rollers. The six-spoked idler is attached to the front bogie and can thus move vertically to some degree. The sprocket, having twenty teeth, is however fixed in relation to the hull. It has a somewhat larger diameter than the idler, causing the upper track profile <b>to</b> <b>slope</b> slightly downwards to the front. The track consists of thirty-three flat links with a width of thirty-six centimetres. The ground pressure is about 0.75kg/cm².|$|E
