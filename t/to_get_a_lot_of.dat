5|$|Babbit {{recruited}} Clea DuVall, who had {{starred in}} her short film Sleeping Beauties, {{to play the}} role of Graham Eaton. Babbit says that she was able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the cast through DuVall, including Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynskey. Lyonne first saw the script in the back of DuVall's car and subsequently contacted her agent about it. She had seen and enjoyed Babbit's short Sleeping Beauties and was eager to work with the director. She was not the first choice for the role of Megan. An unnamed actress wanted to play the part but eventually turned it down because of religious beliefs; she did not want her family to see her face on the poster. Babbit briefly considered Rosario Dawson as Megan but her executive producer persuaded her that Dawson, who is Hispanic, would not be right for the All-American character.|$|E
5|$|Dual Destinies was {{the first}} game in the main series to be {{developed}} for the Nintendo 3DS; this move from the Nintendo DS to the Nintendo 3DS {{was the most difficult}} part of the development, with the development team being unsure of whether to use 2D graphics like with previous games or to use 3D models. Eventually they decided to use 3D graphics, because of the stereoscopic 3D effect being a selling point for the Nintendo 3DS system. Because of the move to 3D, the in-house artist Takuro Fuse was in charge of the art direction, rather than the series regular Tatsuro Iwamoto, so that they could have meetings about the art more often. This was Fuse's first work on the main series, so he initially had problems with making character designs that fit the series, and had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> feedback from Eshiro. According to Eshiro and Yamazaki, they put effort into the graphics, wanting to ensure that Dual Destinies graphics looked better than those of Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney.|$|E
25|$|Because of the unorthodox {{nature of}} hand and body position, {{it is often}} {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> power behind a reverse sweep; in many situations, the intention is to glance or cut the ball to the backward leg area. However, in rare occasions, players have been able to execute reverse sweeps for a six. Kevin Pietersen, who pioneered switch hitting, is adept at this, but one could argue that the resulting shot is basically a sweep rather than a reverse sweep. A more classic example of such a shot would be Yusuf Pathan's six off Robin Peterson. South Africa's AB de Villiers is well known for his ability to hit sixes with the reverse sweep at ease and Glenn Maxwell also often plays reverse sweep.|$|E

500|$|Åkerman {{is noted}} for {{frequently}} appearing in nude scenes in her films, such as The Heartbreak Kid and Watchmen. She {{has stated that}} she feels comfortable {{as long as the}} scenes are not gratuitous. In an interview for Daily Mail, she commented, [...] "I {{spent a lot of time}} as a child in Sweden; it’s natural there ... I don't know many women who go to bed with their husband at night and have sex with a bra on ... So let's make it real in the movies." [...] In 2008, she made her first appearance on AskMen.com's [...] "99 Most Desirable Women" [...] list at number 60. The same year, men's magazine Maxim placed her at number 59 in their annual [...] "Hot 100" [...] rankings. The following year, the magazine ranked her at number four. Although admitting that sex appeal is one of the [...] "best assets", Åkerman considers being beautiful both [...] "a blessing and a curse", stating, [...] "I tend <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> scripts in which people want me to play the trophy wife, which is frustrating because I want the interesting, meaty roles." ...|$|E
500|$|Technical {{director}} Lisa Forsell {{explained that}} {{to enhance the}} richness and beauty of the desert landscapes surrounding Radiator Springs, the filmmakers created a department responsible for matte paintings and sky flats, saying: [...] "Digital matte paintings are a way <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> visual complexity without necessarily having to build complex geometry, and write complex shaders. We spent a lot time working on the clouds and their different formations. They tend to be on several layers and they move relative to each other. The clouds do in fact have some character and personality. The notion was that just as people see themselves in the clouds, cars see various car-shaped clouds. It’s subtle, but there are definitely some that are shaped like a sedan. And if you look closely, you’ll see some that look like tire treads. The fact that so much attention is put on the skies speaks to the visual level of the film. Is there a story point? Not really. There is no pixel on the screen {{that does not have}} an extraordinary level of scrutiny and care applied to it. There is nothing that is just throw-away." ...|$|E

500|$|On May 30, Okafor cut {{his list}} of schools to eight: Arizona, Baylor, Duke, Illinois, Kentucky, Kansas, Michigan State and Ohio State, which {{overlapped}} with Jones in six schools. [...] Although Alexander was ranked as the fifth {{best player in the}} class of 2014 by Rivals.com and had offers from four of the six schools common to both by the beginning of June, he said the chances of him matriculating with Jones and Okafor was slim. As the summer evaluation period continued, the unique nature of the possibility of Okafor and Jones, who are not related and not teammates, going to college as a package continued <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> press. Jones was co-MVP for the 2013 Under Armour Elite 24 All-star game's winning team. On August 13, Jones announced that he would take official visits to four schools Baylor August 30 – September 1; Kentucky September 27–29; Kansas October 18–20; and Duke October 25–27. Notably, Duke, which is the favorite according to Star Tribune writer Amelia Rayno, is scheduled last. [...] On August 14, Jones confirmed that he might make a fifth official visit (the maximum allowed by the NCAA) to Minnesota, although they remained an unlikely underdog. Okafor visited Baylor on August 29 with Jones as the two were ranked 12 in the Rivals.com class of 2014 rankings. One of the reasons Baylor was a serious contender is that Jared Nuness, a member of the Baylor basketball staff, is Jones' cousin.|$|E
