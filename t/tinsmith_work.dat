40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the technological stage of realization of roof cladding and gutter system of a housing building. This building is situated in a gap site of urban development in Františkovy Lázně. For the roofing, seam roofing made of aluminum sheet metal roll was used. There is a gable roof with dormer-windows at {{both sides of the}} roof. For all the conducted <b>tinsmith</b> <b>work</b> including horizontal dormer walls sheathing and attachment of the building to adjacent buildings, aluminum sheet metal was used. A part of finishing <b>tinsmith</b> <b>work</b> is also realization of gutter system which is designed to be made of the same material from the same producer as the roof cladding. Gutter attachment is done by means of assembling polystyrene rollers into façade system of ETICS which ensure thermal bridges’ break...|$|E

Also there were hammers and anvils and soldering irons and a charcoal furnace and many other tools such as a <b>tinsmith</b> <b>works</b> with. Against two of the side walls had been built stout work-benches {{and in the center}} of the room was a long table. At the end of the shop, which adjoined the dwelling, were several cupboards.|$|R

25|$|Disgusted by the {{unconditional}} obedience {{demanded by}} the Catholic orphanage and drawn {{by the prospect of}} adventure, Rocker ran away from the orphanage twice. The first time he just wandered around in the woods around Mainz with occasional visits to the city to forage for food and was retrieved after three nights. The second time, which was at the age of fourteen and a reaction to the orphanage wanting him to be apprenticed as a <b>tinsmith,</b> he <b>worked</b> as a cabin-boy for Köln-Düsseldorfer Dampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft. He enjoyed leaving his hometown and traveling to places like Rotterdam. After he returned, he started an apprenticeship to become a typographer like his uncle Carl.|$|R

My father had a big family that kept him poor, and I was a <b>tinsmith</b> with little <b>work</b> to be had in the village where we lived.

He cried for mercy at the full force of his lungs, while Mrs. Green shouted the same request because of her tin-ware. The audience were equally divided in opinion as to whether Macbeth had been punished enough, and still the blows were delivered with such force and noise that one would have thought an army of <b>tinsmiths</b> were at <b>work.</b>|$|R

Križa u Živogošću u duhu romantičkog historicizma u razdoblju od 1906. do 1908. godine. Historical events infl uenced greatly on {{the visual}} aspect and {{management}} of the monastic complex of the Holy Cross. For example, in the period of the French administration in Dalmatia this monastery of the Holy Cross was used as a garrison of the French army. Consequently, the Franciscan friars were kicked out from the convent, and its entire property was nationalized. Similarly, all their movable estates were sold. However, in the period of the second Austrian administration in Dalmatia this monastery was returned to the Franciscans by the Supreme royal decision of Francis I (22 September 1820). Thus, reconstruction of the complex (i. e. church and the monastery) started in 1820 under the administrations of abbots fra Mijo Majstorović and fra Ivan Žderić (from 1824). Still, the complete reparation lasted throughout the entire nineteenth century. Especially important was reconstruction and furnishing of the church of the Holy Cross, which lasted from May 1906 till November 1907. These activities were supported by fra Ante Gilić and completed by mason Vicko Barić from Makarska. The work included two new altars, one dedicated to Sacred Heart and other to Anthony of Padua, which were both built in the stone-masonry-workshop of Giuseppe Voltolini and Vicko Tagliaferro from Split. Moreover, the new rostrum, tabernacle and fourteen seats in the choir were built in carpentry-shop of Kleme Jakasović and Josip Korlaet from Split. However, {{it is important to note}} that Giovanni Antončić from Split made the gilt of the tabernacle. Similarly, plastering with mortar, together with the painting of the walls and setting the art- -deco white-black tiles was done by Lorenzo Gallo from Split, while other plastering and setting the marble coating was the work of Giuseppe Buella, Eligio Venegoni, Michele Elefanto and Michelle Aduce, who worked for Marko Markovina. After the reconstruction was fi nished in summer 1907, painter Franceso Ravalico from Split started to paint the celling of the church, sacristy and the choir. By the same token, reconstruction of the monastic complex in Živogošće began in May 1906 and it lasted till September 1908 under the administration of abbot fra Ante Gilić. One can notice that the reconstructions of the church and the monastery were coordinated and infl uenced by the architectural renovation of the cathedral church in Makarska, as well as there is visible similarity with the project of the new Franciscan church, placed also in Makarska. It is important to note that there are some similarities with the work of architect Perišić, who had projected the church of St. Anthony in Tučepi. The entire reconstruction is a nice representative of the romantic historicism, especially regarding the monumental southern facade that was divided by pilasters into three sections, as well as regarding the construction of the windows (neo-baroque arches with profi les in the historicism manner) and reconstruction of the terrace above the former defense tower, together with the renovation of the cloister with a fountain. The masonry work on the southern facade did Ivan Zlatar from Povlje on the island of Brač. Carpentry was again done by the aforementioned shop of Kleme Jakasović and Josip Korlaet. Moreover, <b>tinsmith’s</b> <b>work</b> and setting of the plumbing pipes was done by Filippo and Bartolo Monton from Split, and plastering with mortar was done by Frano Smoje with his helpers from Split. At the end, when all the craft-work was fi nished in summer of 1908, painter Francesco Ravalico from Split limned the eastern wall of the dining room, and the motive was the Last supper...|$|R
