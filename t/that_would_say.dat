By August there were almost 30 systems in the nodelist, 50 by September, and over 160 by January 1985. As the network grew, the {{maintenance}} of the nodelist became prohibitive, and errors were common. In these cases people would start receiving phone calls at 4 AM, from a caller <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> nothing and then hang up. In other cases the system would be listed before it was up and running, resulting long distance calls that accomplished nothing.|$|E
500|$|The Nevermind {{album cover}} shows a naked baby boy, alone {{underwater}} with a US dollar bill on a fishhook {{just out of}} his reach. According to Cobain, he conceived of the idea while watching a television program on water births with Grohl. Cobain mentioned it to Geffen's art director Robert Fisher. Fisher found some stock footage of underwater births but they were too graphic for the record company. Furthermore, the stock house that controlled the photo of a swimming baby that they subsequently settled on wanted $7,500 a year for its use. Instead, Fisher sent a photographer, Kirk Weddle, to a pool for babies to take pictures. Five shots resulted and the band settled on {{the image of a}} four-month-old infant named Spencer Elden, the son of Weddle's friend. However, there was some concern because Elden's [...] penis was visible in the image. Geffen prepared an alternate cover without the penis, as they were afraid that it would offend people, but relented when Cobain {{made it clear that the}} only compromise he would accept was a sticker covering the penis <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "If you're offended by this, you must be a closet pedophile." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, American Continental's profits {{were in the}} {{millions}} and it had become the biggest single-family home builder in Phoenix and Denver. At its peak it would have $6 billion in assets, {{a large number of}} subsidiaries, 2,500 employees, and a headquarters complex on Phoenix's Camelback Road. It had three corporate jets and a helicopter. He was a very hard worker and a strong presence to his employees; one later said, [...] "It's almost magnetic. When he moves, things happen. The office would come alive when he walked in." [...] He inspired both camaraderie and fervent loyalty in them. While he demanded long hours, he often rewarded employees monetarily and with gifts. Businesspeople outside his company often found Keating arrogant and difficult to deal with. Congressman William Keating, who was well-liked, said of his brother: [...] "Charlie is impatient, aggressive, always on the move. He has clearly defined goals. I don't think he worries about the popularity of his positions." [...] A Fortune profile in 1977 reported, [...] "It seems almost impossible to find anyone who actually likes Charlie Keating." [...] The story rankled Keating, who later had over five thousand large yellow [...] "I Like Charlie Keating" [...] buttons made up which he handed out to employees and visitors. Keating said, [...] "There {{are a lot of people}} <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> nasty things, I'm sure, about me, but it ain't true that nobody ever liked Charlie Keating." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1968, Jarrell and {{his wife}} opened WJ Studio and Gallery, below their home and studio. The space not only showcased the couple's work and that of other artists but went on to display the talents of Chicago poets and musicians. Jarrell's love for blues and jazz music {{made it easy for}} him to access the city's talent and his {{involvement}} with OCAC provided him with contacts in the poetry world. Artists such as Muhal Richard Abrams, John Stubblefield, Henry Threadgill, Anthony Braxton and the Chicago Art Ensemble would perform at the space. The gallery also served as a gathering place for the likes of Jeff Donaldson, Barbara Jones-Hogu, Gerald Williams and others, who would come to discuss concepts of a relevant black art aesthetic. The group struggled: Jarrell described the search as an attempt to find [...] "a collective concept <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> 'black art' at a glance." [...] Eventually, the group made a breakthrough while listing principles and ideas regarding the concept of black art; the term [...] "coolade colors" [...] was contributed by a fabric designer. The term covered the bright fashion of stylish African American men of the time, which Jarrell described as [...] "loud lime, pimp yellows, hot pinks, high-key color clothing." [...] The final concept for their aesthetic search would be message oriented art, revolving around socially aware content. African design would be included and meaningfulness for black people would be a necessity. This group's formation would be considered one of the best aligned and organized collectives in the Black Arts Movement. This group went on to form COBRA.|$|E

[...] "Now there's a lot more experience in the side with Hookes and Bright," [...] he said. [...] "It's a lot easier on me. With the side in England {{and even in the}} first Test against New Zealand there was basically only me <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> anything of a stern nature or a congratulatory nature. But we've got Hookesy now walk ing around and really giving Craig McDcrmott a big rocket or a positive word. The way Ray and David keep an eye on things, it's not just me any more. The feeling {{over the past few weeks}} has been great but now there's a greater commitment." ...|$|E

60|$|She quite {{understood}} his plan; it seemed mean {{of her to}} accept his proposal, and she argued feebly against it. But he overcame all her objections. For his own sake, he told her, he would prefer the scandal to be connected with his name rather than with that of his wife. As he unfolded his scheme, {{she began to feel}} that in acquiescing she was conferring a favour. It was not the first deception he had arranged for the public, and he appeared to be half in love with his own cleverness.
