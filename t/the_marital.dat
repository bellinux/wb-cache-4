5|$|Following the annulment, Cromwell was {{executed}} on 28 July. Cranmer now {{found himself in}} a politically prominent position, with no-one else to shoulder the burden. Throughout the rest of Henry's reign, he clung to Henry's authority. The king had total trust in him and in return, Cranmer could not conceal anything from the king. At the end of June 1541, Henry with his new wife, Catherine Howard, left for his first visit to the north of England. Cranmer was left in London {{as a member of a}} council taking care of matters for the king in his absence. His colleagues were Lord Chancellor Thomas Audley and Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford. This was Cranmer's first major piece of responsibility outside the Church. In October, while the king and queen were away, a reformer named John Lascelles revealed to Cranmer that Catherine engaged in extramarital affairs. Cranmer gave the information to Audley and Seymour and they decided to wait until Henry's return. Afraid of angering the king, Audley and Seymour suggested that Cranmer inform Henry. Cranmer slipped a message to Henry during mass on All Saints Day. An investigation revealed the truth of <b>the</b> <b>marital</b> indiscretions and Catherine {{was executed}} in February 1542.|$|E
5|$|Gosling {{came to the}} {{attention}} of a wider audience in 2004 with a leading role in the commercially successful romantic drama The Notebook. His performance as a drug-addicted teacher in Half Nelson (2006) was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor and his performance as a socially inept loner in Lars and the Real Girl (2007) was nominated for a Golden Globe Award. After a three-year acting hiatus, Gosling starred in <b>the</b> <b>marital</b> drama Blue Valentine (2010), earning him a second Golden Globe Award nomination. Gosling co-starred in three mainstream films in 2011–the romantic comedy-drama Crazy, Stupid, Love, the political drama The Ides of March, and the neo-noir crime thriller Drive–and received two more Golden Globe Award nominations. His directorial debut, Lost River, was released to poor reviews in 2014. Greater success came to Gosling when he starred in two critically acclaimed films–the financial comedy-drama The Big Short (2015) and the musical La La Land (2016). For the latter, he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and received a second Oscar nomination.|$|E
5|$|In June 1937 the Old Vic company took up an {{invitation}} to perform Hamlet {{in the courtyard of}} the castle at Elsinore, where Shakespeare located the play. Olivier secured the casting of Leigh to replace Cherry Cottrell as Ophelia. Because of torrential rain the performance had to be moved from the castle courtyard to the ballroom of a local hotel, but the tradition of playing Hamlet at Elsinore was established, and Olivier was followed by, among others, Gielgud (1939), Redgrave (1950), Richard Burton (1954), Derek Jacobi (1979), Kenneth Branagh (1988) and Jude Law (2009). Back in London, the company staged Macbeth, with Olivier in the title role. The stylised production by Michel Saint-Denis was not well liked, but Olivier had some good notices among the bad. On returning from Denmark, Olivier and Leigh told their respective spouses about the affair and that their marriages were over; Esmond moved out of <b>the</b> <b>marital</b> house and in with her mother. After Olivier and Leigh made a tour of Europe in mid 1937 they returned to separate film projects—A Yank at Oxford for her and The Divorce of Lady X for him—and moved into a property together in Iver, Buckinghamshire.|$|E

30|$|However, it {{is worth}} noting that there are two “mothers” in the newly formed family—the husband’s mother (paternal parent) and the wife’s mother (maternal parent). Although the {{influence}} of <b>the</b> wife’s <b>marital</b> power on economic support to maternal parents is not significant and Hypothesis 2 a is not verified after controlling other variables of family and wife, in model 2 there is a tendency revealed that the influence of <b>the</b> wife’s <b>marital</b> power on economic support to maternal parents is in an opposite direction to the influence on economic support to paternal parents. In other words, the greater <b>the</b> wife’s <b>marital</b> power, <b>the</b> more probable it is that the family will increase economic support to maternal parents.|$|R

Also of note are the depictions of Marie on holiday in Ravello on the Amalfi Coast of Italy in 1890; the portrait for the frieze in the dining room at Skagen's Brøndums Hotel; Chez Moi, a series of watercolours of Marie and the couple's daughter Vibeke in the family homes in Copenhagen and Skagen; and Midsummer Eve Bonfire on Skagen Beach, his last painting of her in which she is shown captured in the firelight with Alfvén.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{contrasting}} views regarding <b>the</b> <b>marital</b> {{status of}} Tulsidas. According to the Mula Gosain Charita {{and some other}} works, Tulsidas was married to Ratnavali on the thirteenth day of the bright half of the Jyeshta month (May–June) in Vikram 1583 (1526 CE). Ratnavali {{was the daughter of}} Dinbandhu Pathak, a Brahmin of the Bharadwaja Gotra, who belonged to Mahewa village of Kaushambi district. They had a son named Tarak who died as a toddler. Once when Tulsidas had gone to a Hanuman temple, Ratnavali went to her father's home with her brother. When Tulsidas came to know this, he swam across the Yamuna river in the night to meet his wife. Ratnavali chided Tulsidas for this, and remarked that if Tulsidas was even half as devoted to God as he was to her body of flesh and blood, he would have been redeemed. Tulsidas left her instantly and left for the holy city of Prayag. Here, he renounced the Grihastha (householder's life) stage and became a Sadhu (Hindu ascetic).|$|E

40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the relationship between <b>the</b> level of <b>marital</b> adjustment <b>the</b> child perceives the parents as having obtained and the degree of self-acceptance exhibited by the child. It has been proposed by theorists and researchers that the individual is influenced by his environment as it appears to him. The perception of the environment leads to the development of concepts concerning self, others, and situations. Thus, it becomes necessary to discover the concepts which the child has concerning <b>the</b> parental <b>marital</b> adjustment based on his perception of the situation. A secondary {{purpose of this}} study is to determine if a relationship exists between the child’s perception of <b>the</b> parental <b>marital</b> adjustment and <b>the</b> parent’s perception of their <b>marital</b> situation. On <b>the</b> basis of current personality theory and prior research in this area, two hypotheses are proposed:(1) High parental martial adjustment as perceived by the child will be significantly related to high self-acceptance of the child. Low parental marital adjustment as perceived by the child, on the other hand, will be related to low self-acceptance of the child. (2) No significant relationship exists between <b>the</b> parental <b>marital</b> adjustment as perceived by the child and <b>the</b> parental <b>marital</b> adjustment as perceived by the parents.
