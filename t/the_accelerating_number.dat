40|$|International audienceRecent {{application}} of theories of embodied or grounded cognition to the recognition {{and interpretation of}} facial expression of emotion {{has led to an}} explosion of research in psychology and the neurosciences. However, despite <b>the</b> <b>accelerating</b> <b>number</b> of reported findings, it remains unclear how the many component processes of emotion and their neural mechanisms actually support embodied simulation. Equally unclear is what triggers the use of embodied simulation versus perceptual or conceptual strategies in determining meaning. The present article integrates behavioral research from social psychology with recent research in neurosciences in order to provide coherence to the extant and future research on this topic. The roles of several of the brain's reward systems, and the amygdala, somatosensory cortices, and motor centers are examined. These are then linked to behavioral and brain research on facial mimicry and eye gaze. Articulation of the mediators and moderators of facial mimicry and gaze are particularly useful in guiding interpretation of relevant findings from neurosciences. Finally, a model of the processing of the smile, the most complex of the facial expressions, is presented as a means to illustrate how to advance the {{application of}} theories of embodied cognition in the study of facial expression of emotion...|$|E
40|$|Identifying {{lifestyle}} {{strategies and}} allied neurobiological mechanisms that reduce aging-related motor impairment is imperative, given <b>the</b> <b>accelerating</b> <b>number</b> of retirees and increased life expectancy. A physically active lifestyle prior to old age can reduce risk of debilitating motor decline. However, if exercise is initiated after motor decline has {{begun in the}} lifespan, it is unknown if aging itself may impose a limit on exercise efficacy to decelerate further aging-related motor decline. In Brown-Norway/Fischer 344 F 1 hybrid (BNF) rats, locomotor activity begins to decrease in middle age (12 - 18 months). One mechanism of aging-related motor decline may be decreased expression of GDNF family receptor, GFRα- 1, which is decreased in substantia nigra (SN) between 12 and 30 months old. Moderate exercise, beginning at 18 months old, increases nigral GFRα- 1 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression within 2 months. In aged rats, replenishing aging-related loss of GFRα- 1 in SN increases TH in SN alone and locomotor activity. A moderate exercise regimen was initiated in sedentary male BNF rats in a longitudinal study to evaluate if exercise could attenuate aging-related motor decline when initiated at two different ages {{in the latter half}} of the lifespan (18 or 24 months old). Motor decline was reversed in the 18 -, but not 24 -month-old, cohort. However, exercise efficacy in the 18 -month-old group was reduced as the rats reached 27 months old. GFRα- 1 expression was not increased in either cohort. These studies suggest exercise can decelerate motor decline when begun {{in the latter half of}} the lifespan, but its efficacy may be limited by age of initiation. Decreased plasticity of GFRα- 1 expression following exercise may limit its efficacy to reverse motor decline...|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} laser {{acceleration}} of ions from Si 3 N 4 and Al foils ranging in thickness from 1800 to 8 nm with {{particular interest in}} acceleration of ions from {{the bulk of the}} target. The study includes results of experiments conducted with the HERCULES laser with pulse duration 40 fs and intensity 3 × 1020 W cm− 2 and corresponding two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. When the target thickness was reduced the distribution of ion species heavier than protons transitioned from being dominated by carbon contaminant ions of low ionization states to being dominated by high ionization states of bulk ions (such as Si 12 +) and carbon. Targets in the range 50 – 150 nm yielded dramatically greater particle number and higher ion maximum energy for these high ionization states compared to thicker targets typifying the Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) regime. The high charge states persisted for the thinnest targets, but <b>the</b> <b>accelerated</b> particle <b>numbers</b> decreased for targets 35 nm and thinner.

40|$|This article uses a {{political}} market framework to analyze how {{the structure of}} local political institutions affects the relative political influence of development and environmental interests {{in the context of}} urban growth. Using panel data from 406 Florida cities from 1998 to 2003, the empirical analysis finds important interaction effects between the structure of city executive branch institutions and interest group variables. The economic and political forces driving urban growth do not operate identically in all cities—they vary as a function of institutional context. Institutional structure helps determinewhich interest groups have their preferences reflected in local land-use changes and development patterns. The resulting patterns suggest a “sustainability paradox ” wherein richer, environmental interests push for the preservation of environmental amenities while at <b>the</b> same time <b>accelerating</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of residential units built in a community.

The response of bush and climbing bean to excessive and minimal soil moisture at various plant growth stages was investigated under greenhouse for two growing periods; September-February 2016 and March-July 2016. The control consisted in watering with recommended rates for each plant growth stage. Two bean genotypes RWR 2245 (bush bean) and MAC 44 (climbing bean) were used for this study. The minimal soil moisture (drought stress) treatment consisted of withholding water supply, from the on-set of emergence, vegetative, flowering, pod setting and seed filling growth stages, up to the wilting point of plants. The excessive soil moisture (waterlogging stress) was achieved by saturating the soil {{on a daily basis}} for five successive days, starting from the on-set of the aforementioned plant growth stages.

40|$|The {{advances}} in multicore technology and modern interconnects is rapidly <b>accelerating</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of cores deployed in today’s commodity clusters. A majority of parallel applications written in MPI employ collective operations in their communication kernels. Optimization of these operations on the multicore platforms {{is the key}} to obtaining good performance speed-ups. However, designing these operations on the modern multicores is a non-trivial task. Modern multicores such as Intel’s Clovertown and AMD’s Opteron feature various architectural attributes resulting in interesting ramifications. For example, Clovertown deploys shared L 2 caches for a pair of cores whereas in Opteron, L 2 caches are exclusive to a core. Understanding the impact of these architectures on communication performance is crucial to designing efficient collective algorithms. In this paper, we systematically evaluate these architectures and use these insights to develop efficient collective operations such as MPI Bcast, MPI Allgather, MPI Allreduce and MPI Alltoall. Further, we characterize the behavior of these collective algorithms on multicores especially when concurrent network and intra-node communications occur. We also evaluate the benefits of the proposed intra-node MPI Allreduce over Opteron multicores and compare it with Intel Clovertown systems.
