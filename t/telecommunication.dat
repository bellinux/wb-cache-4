5|$|<b>Telecommunication</b> has a {{significant}} social, cultural and economic impact on modern society. In 2008, estimates placed the <b>telecommunication</b> industry's revenue at $4.7 trillion or just under 3 {{percent of the gross}} world product (official exchange rate). Several following sections discuss the impact of <b>telecommunication</b> on society.|$|E
5|$|From {{a global}} perspective, {{there have been}} {{political}} debates and legislation regarding the management of <b>telecommunication</b> and broadcasting. The history of broadcasting discusses some debates in relation to balancing conventional communication such as printing and <b>telecommunication</b> such as radio broadcasting. The onset of World War II brought on the first explosion of international broadcasting propaganda. Countries, their governments, insurgents, terrorists, and militiamen have all used <b>telecommunication</b> and broadcasting techniques to promote propaganda. Patriotic propaganda for political movements and colonization started the mid-1930s. In 1936, the BBC broadcast propaganda to the Arab World to partly counter similar broadcasts from Italy, which also had colonial interests in North Africa.|$|E
5|$|Pakistan <b>Telecommunication</b> Company Limited is {{the main}} {{provider}} of fixed line, mobile and broadband services. Regional headquarters {{is located at the}} Central Telecom House in Chinot Bazaar. With the deregulation of the <b>telecommunication</b> sector by the Ministry of Information Technology, a range of companies now offer mobile and broadband services in the city.|$|E
5|$|<b>Telecommunication</b> has had {{an equally}} {{significant}} impact on advertising. TNS Media Intelligence reported that in 2007, 58% of advertising expenditure in the United States was spent on media that depend upon <b>telecommunication.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Telecommunication</b> in Sabah and Sarawak were {{originally}} administered by Posts and <b>Telecommunication</b> Department until 1967, and {{maintained by the}} British Cable & Wireless Communications before all telecommunications management in the state been takeover by Peninsular-based company. The British <b>telecommunication</b> company have establish a submarine cable that linking Kota Kinabalu with Singapore and Hong Kong. Following {{the expansion of the}} Peninsular-based company on 1 January 1968, Sabah Posts and <b>Telecommunication</b> Department was merged with the Peninsular <b>telecommunication</b> department to formed Telecommunications Department Malaysia. All operations under Telecommunications Department Malaysia was then transferred to Syarikat Telekom Malaysia Berhad (STM) which become a public listed company in 1991 with the federal government retained a majority shareholding. There are also other <b>telecommunication</b> companies operating in the state although only providing cellular phone facilities. In 2006, the state has the lowest Direct Exchange Line (DEL) penetration rate, with cellular and internet dial-up penetrations rate only 6.5 per 100 inhabitants. Most residents from the low income groups would rather use mobile phones internet or use internet at their offices instead of setting up internet access at home as the Malaysian main internet provider of Telekom Malaysia were unable to build high speed low cost internet due to the high cost of equipment which are mostly sourced from abroad. Until the end of 2014, there were only 934 <b>telecommunication</b> hotspots in Sabah. Due to this, the government are working to increase the penetration and capability of internet connection as well {{to bridge the gap between}} Sabah and the Peninsular. The mobile telecommunications in Sabah are mostly use 4G and 3G and there is free rural Wi-Fi services provided by the federal government known as the Kampung Tanpa Wayar 1Malaysia (KTW) although Malaysia's public internet speeds are among the slower than many other countries.|$|E
5|$|<b>Telecommunication</b> over fixed {{lines is}} called {{point-to-point}} communication {{because it is}} between one transmitter and one receiver. <b>Telecommunication</b> through radio broadcasts is called broadcast communication because it is between one powerful transmitter and numerous low-power but sensitive radio receivers.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{economic}} benefits of good <b>telecommunication</b> infrastructure, there is increasing worry about the inequitable access to <b>telecommunication</b> services amongst various countries of the world—this {{is known as the}} digital divide. A 2003 survey by the International <b>Telecommunication</b> Union (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of countries have fewer than one mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries have fewer than one land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies. Using this measure, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland received the highest ranking while the African countries Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali received the lowest.|$|E
5|$|Modern <b>telecommunication</b> {{is founded}} {{on a series of}} key {{concepts}} that experienced progressive development and refinement in a period of well over a century.|$|E
5|$|Official {{sponsors}} of the broadcast were the main Swedish-Finnish <b>telecommunication</b> company TeliaSonera, and the German cosmetics company Schwarzkopf. The competition sponsors were the makeup company IsaDora cosmetics, the supermarket ICA and Tetra Pak.|$|E
5|$|Pakistan <b>Telecommunication</b> Authority is a government-owned {{organisation}} that {{is responsible}} for the establishment, operation and maintenance of telecommunications in the city. The organisation monitors and prevents illegal exchanges in the city.|$|E
5|$|<b>Telecommunication</b> is the {{transmission}} of signs, signals, messages, words, writings, images and sounds or information of any nature by wire, radio, optical or other electromagnetic systems. <b>Telecommunication</b> occurs when the exchange of information between communication participants includes the use of technology. It is transmitted either electrically over physical media, such as cables, or via electromagnetic radiation. Such transmission paths are often divided into communication channels which afford the advantages of multiplexing. Since the Latin term communicatio is considered the social process of information exchange, the term, telecommunications, is often used in its plural form because it involves many different technologies.|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} of Kazakhstan also held {{talks with the}} heads of Chinese corporations and agreed to cooperate {{in the areas of}} aircraft production, <b>telecommunication</b> and mining.|$|E
5|$|As the {{financial}} {{capital of the}} Republic of Macedonia, Skopje is {{the seat of the}} Macedonian Stock Exchange, of the National Bank and of most of the Macedonian banking, insurance and <b>telecommunication</b> companies, such as Makedonski Telekom, Komercijalna banka Skopje and Stopanska Banka. The services sector produces 60% of the city GDP.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, 94% {{of urban}} Sarawak was {{supplied}} with electricity, but only 67% of rural areas had electricity. However, this had increased to 91% by 2014. According to a 2015 article, household internet penetration in Sarawak {{was lower than}} Malaysian national average, 41.2% versus 58.6%, with 58.5% of internet use being in urban areas and 29.9% in rural areas. In comparison, mobile <b>telecommunication</b> uptake in Sarawak was comparable to the national average, 93.3% against a national average of 94.2%, and on par with neighbouring Sabah. Mobile <b>telecommunication</b> infrastructure, specifically broadcast towers, are built and managed by SacofaSdnBhd (Sacofa Private Limited), which enjoys a monopoly in Sarawak after the company was granted a 20-year exclusivity deal on the provision, maintenance and leasing of towers in the state.|$|E
5|$|In {{cultural}} terms, <b>telecommunication</b> {{has increased}} the public's ability to access music and film. With television, people can watch films they have not seen before {{in their own home}} without having to travel to the video store or cinema. With radio and the Internet, people can listen to music they have not heard before without having to travel to the music store.|$|E
5|$|India's <b>telecommunication</b> industry, the world's fastest-growing, added 227 million {{subscribers}} {{during the period}} 2010–11, and after {{the third quarter of}} 2017, India surpassed the US to become the second largest smartphone market in the world after China.|$|E
5|$|On the {{macroeconomic}} scale, Lars-Hendrik Röller and Leonard Waverman {{suggested a}} causal link between good <b>telecommunication</b> infrastructure and economic growth. Few dispute {{the existence of}} a correlation although some argue it is wrong to view the relationship as causal.|$|E
5|$|On the microeconomic scale, {{companies}} have used telecommunications {{to help build}} global business empires. This is self-evident {{in the case of}} online retailer Amazon.com but, according to academic Edward Lenert, even the conventional retailer Walmart has benefited from better <b>telecommunication</b> infrastructure compared to its competitors. In cities throughout the world, home owners use their telephones to order and arrange a variety of home services ranging from pizza deliveries to electricians. Even relatively poor communities have been noted to use <b>telecommunication</b> to their advantage. In Bangladesh's Narshingdi district, isolated villagers use cellular phones to speak directly to wholesalers and arrange a better price for their goods. In Côte d'Ivoire, coffee growers share mobile phones to follow hourly variations in coffee prices and sell at the best price.|$|E
5|$|Samuel Morse {{independently}} {{developed a}} version of the electrical telegraph that he unsuccessfully demonstrated on 2 September 1837. His code was an important advance over Wheatstone's signaling method. The first transatlantic telegraph cable was successfully completed on 27 July 1866, allowing transatlantic <b>telecommunication</b> for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Telecommunications {{in which}} {{multiple}} transmitters and multiple receivers {{have been designed}} to cooperate and to share the same physical channel are called multiplex systems. The sharing of physical channels using multiplexing often gives very large reductions in costs. Multiplexed systems are laid out in <b>telecommunication</b> networks, and the multiplexed signals are switched at nodes through to the correct destination terminal receiver.|$|E
5|$|The International <b>Telecommunication</b> Union uses {{an internationally}} agreed system for {{classifying}} radio frequency signals. Each Type of radio emission is classified {{according to its}} bandwidth, method of modulation, nature of the modulating signal, and Type of information transmitted on the carrier signal. It is based on characteristics of the signal, not on the transmitter used.|$|E
5|$|The {{challenge}} for NASA's imaging team was that, as the mission progressed, the objects being photographed were getting {{farther away from}} the spacecraft, therefore appearing fainter and requiring longer exposures and even slewing (panning) of the cameras to achieve good quality. The <b>telecommunication</b> capability also decreased with distance, limiting the number of data modes that could be used by the imaging system.|$|E
5|$|The high {{non-linearity}} of {{lithium niobate}} {{also makes it}} useful in non-linear optics applications. It is used extensively in <b>telecommunication</b> products such as mobile phones and optical modulators, for such components as resonant crystals. Lithium applications are used in more than 60% of mobile phones.|$|E
5|$|The site later hosted an Air Force White Alice <b>telecommunication</b> {{system in}} 1959 to 1961, and a {{temporary}} relay {{station in the}} 1960s and 1970s. A prototype Relocatable Over-the-Horizon Radar system existed on Amchitka between 1991 and 1993 to conduct surveillance on Russia.|$|E
5|$|The <b>telecommunication</b> {{system is}} basic and expensive, with fixed {{telephone}} services provided by the state telephone company SotelTchad. Only 14,000 fixed telephone lines serve all of Chad, {{one of the lowest}} telephone density rates in the world.|$|E
5|$|As of {{the year}} 2000, about 15% of United States {{consumption}} of germanium was used for infrared optics technology and 50% for fiber-optics. Over the past 20 years, infrared use has consistently decreased; fiber optic demand, however, is slowly increasing. In America, 30–50% of current fiber optic lines are unused dark fiber, sparking discussion of over-production and a future reduction in demand. Worldwide, demand is increasing dramatically as countries such as China are installing fiber optic <b>telecommunication</b> lines throughout the country.|$|E
5|$|Coimbatore has a well-connected {{communications}} infrastructure. Till the 1990s {{the state}} owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) {{was the only}} <b>telecommunication</b> service provider in the city. In the 1990s, private telecom companies too started offering their services. , BSNL, Reliance Communications, Bharti Airtel and Tata Teleservices offer broadband service and fixed line services. MTS offers mobile broadband services. Cellular telephony was first introduced in 1997 and mobile telephone services available. Coimbatore is {{the headquarters of the}} Tamil Nadu circle of cellular service providers.|$|E
5|$|In <b>telecommunication</b> networks, {{heterodyning}} {{is used to}} move {{frequencies of}} individual signals to different channels which may share a single physical transmission line. This is called frequency division multiplexing (FDM). For example, a coaxial cable used by a cable television system can carry 500 television channels {{at the same time}} because each one is given a different frequency, so they don't interfere with one another. Continuous wave (CW) doppler radar detectors are basically heterodyne detection devices that compare transmitted and reflected beams.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{baseband}} pass range {{used was}} 200Hz to 2500Hz but later the International <b>Telecommunication</b> Union {{set a standard}} of 300Hz to 3.4kHz with 4kHz spacing. Thus the filtering was required to go from fully pass to fully stop {{in the space of}} 900Hz. This standard in telephony is still in use today and had remained widespread until it began to be supplanted by digital techniques from the 1980s onwards.|$|E
5|$|Major <b>telecommunication</b> {{employers}} with {{headquarters in}} the state include Cincinnati Bell, Ohio Bell, a subsidiary of AT in Cleveland; Ohio Telecom in Port Clinton, RACO Industries in Blue Ash, First Communications in Akron, and Horizon Telcom, Inc. in Chillicothe. Companies with operations in the state include L-3 Communications, Time Warner, AT, Verizon, Sprint, SBA Networks, Collabera Inc., Cavalier Telephone, Waveland Communications, Embarq, Open Range Communications, Russell Cellular, and Windstream Communications. Frontier Communications in 2010 announced $150 million in investment {{in the state to}} upgrade systems and high-speed internet services.|$|E
5|$|<b>Telecommunication</b> Office (TELOF), {{telegram}} system, Liberty Telecom, public calling stations {{under the}} DOTC and the Provincial Communication System (PCS) radio transceivers and receivers. Smart Communications, Sun Cellular and Globe Telecom already have relay stations in Romblon, Odiongan and Cajidiocan, enabling most areas province-wide connected through cellphones, except on some {{area where the}} signal is weak or non-existent because of mountains that block the signal. The Triple Peak in Santa Maria has a relay station for PLDT and Liberty Telecom.|$|E
5|$|<b>Telecommunication</b> {{has played}} a {{significant}} role in social relationships. Nevertheless, devices like the telephone system were originally advertised with an emphasis on the practical dimensions of the device (such as the ability to conduct business or order home services) as opposed to the social dimensions. It was not until the late 1920s and 1930s that the social dimensions of the device became a prominent theme in telephone advertisements. New promotions started appealing to consumers' emotions, stressing the importance of social conversations and staying connected to family and friends.|$|E
5|$|The BlackBerry Bold 9700 (codenamed Onyx) is a {{smartphone}} {{developed by}} <b>telecommunication</b> company BlackBerry, {{formerly known as}} Research in Motion (RIM). The second device in the Bold series, it succeeds the model 9000 and precedes the Bold 9650. The device, which runs on the BlackBerry OS, features several improvements over the 9000, including introduction of an optical trackpad, and a reduced size overall. Other visual changes were carried out in order to appeal both men and women.|$|E
5|$|The French 55th Infantry Division was not {{prepared}} for such an attack. French soldiers had commented on the massive psychological effect of the bombardment, in particular the siren of the Ju 87. However, after the war, {{it was discovered that}} none of the bunkers had been destroyed by direct hits. Moreover, just 56 French casualties were suffered. It was the indirect effect that did the damage. The <b>telecommunication</b> cables were destroyed (most had been laid out in the open) through bombing, paralysing the division's communications, and the psychological damage crippled its defensive capacity.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Post Office had a {{monopoly}} over telecommunications until 1987 when Telecom New Zealand was formed, initially as a state-owned enterprise and then privatised in 1990. Chorus, which was split from Telecom (now Spark) in 2011, still owns {{the majority of}} the telecommunications infrastructure, but competition from other providers has increased. , the United Nations International <b>Telecommunication</b> Union ranks New Zealand 13th in the development of information and communications infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Two planned townships in {{the greater}} Kolkata region are Bidhannagar, also known as Salt Lake City and located {{north-east}} of the city; and Rajarhat, also called New Town and sited east of Bidhannagar. In the 2000s, SectorV in Bidhannagar developed into a business hub for information technology and <b>telecommunication</b> companies. Both Bidhannagar and New Town are situated outside the Kolkata Municipal Corporation limits, in their own municipalities.|$|E
