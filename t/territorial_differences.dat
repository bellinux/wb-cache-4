The point where they eventually met was set as the other extreme of the island, and the subsequently created line was chosen as the frontier, dividing Saint-Martin from Sint Maarten.

40|$|Introduction. Primary {{health care}} in the Republic of Serbia is {{predominantly}} funded by the Republic Health Insurance Fund (RHIF). From the total income of health centers and institutes at the primary level, with no pharmacy and pharmacies (Kosovo excluded), 84 % in 2008 was paid by RHIF.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the expenditures for primary health care for each insured person in statistically defined districts in the Republic of Serbia, with an emphasis on prevention participation. Material and Methods. Retrospective and comparative analysis of health statistics from the database of the Institute of Public Health of Serbia (IPHS) and financial data from the RHIF for the period 2006 - 2008 was done. Results. Observed by the districts in 2008, in Vojvodina, the lowest expenditure for primary health care had North Backa District (5, 207 RSD) and greatest was in West Backa District (6, 632 RSD) per capita.

40|$|Slavic {{names of}} ‘the back’ and ‘the shoulders’ {{in the light}} of dialectal {{materials}} and historic sources The meaning of the names of ‘the back’ and ‘the shoulders’ are very ambiguous, which is also characteristic of the other names of the parts of the body. Certain names of ‘the back’ often refer to only their upper or lower part, as well as to ‘the spinal column’, while certain names of ‘the shoulders’ also mean ‘the shoulder’, ‘the upper part of the arm, however, below the elbow’ or ‘the whole arm to the palm’. In the plural form, this causes the confusion between ‘the back’ and ‘the shoulders’. ‘The back’ and ‘the shoulder’ have only one group of common indigenous names: *pletji, *pletj-E and several word-forming derivates. In the both meanings, one form – *pletji – occurred, which was characterized by an obvious <b>territorial</b> <b>difference.</b> In addition, in the names of ‘the back’, the names: spina and formations *χrьbьtъ, *χribьtъ, connected with the root *gъrb-, *lędvьje and *zada cover wide territories. The remaining ones are extremely rare. In the names of ‘the shoulders’, however, apart from the lexemes connected with the root *pletj-, names derived from the root *orm-, exhibiting a great morphological differentiation, occur. Lack of information in OLA records about grammatical forms somewhat complicates their interpretation. The clarification of complicated morphological transformations of these forms is made easier only by materials derived from beyond OLA. Historical materials prove that in eastern Slavic languages originally the names derived from the root *orm- were unknown...|$|R
40|$|The {{modern world}} {{is marked by}} legal and {{political}} boundaries at all scales; the meeting of two territories is a condition so common as to escape notice in everyday life. Yet {{the nature of the}} relationship between these divisions and real things is rarely considered: a barrier at the edge of a territory is taken to embody legal, political, or social difference in simple and transparent ways. This assumption has profound implications for the material and social landscape. Beginning to question it, and suggesting practice in light of these questions, is the goal of this essay. The essay is divided into three parts. The first considers allotment in several ancient, medieval, and early modern societies. It argues that the practice of dividing land was marked over time by growing tensions between law and matter, and that the European settlement of North America was a quantitatively and qualitatively new stage in this process. The second chapter traces these tensions in the domestic and public landscapes of the United States since the nineteenth century, and argues that they present a practical challenge to design and building. The third chapter responds to this challenge. It returns to the wider geography of the first part to find examples of physical boundaries [...] 'walls' [...] that not only express <b>territorial</b> <b>difference</b> but stage an array of social and ecological interactions. These examples form the basis for re conceiving the marking of territory: for an ethics of enclosure in the modern landscape. by Brian Thomas Oles. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{development}} of Knowledge Intensive Business Services (KIBS) {{in recent decades}} {{can be interpreted as}} one of the major factors in a transition from an industrial economy into a knowledge-based one. It is an increasingly common belief that KIBS not only perform innovation activities {{in the service of the}} manufacturing sector, but they are also "bridges of knowledge" or "innovation bridges", connecting the manufacturing sector, science and customers. The research questions were numerous. This paper attempts to reveal the existence of any relationship indicators, with special regards to the tourism indices and the KIBS related variables and how their position among different development indicators can be determined. It also explores whether there is any <b>territorial</b> <b>difference</b> or disparity within the counties of Romania. The results show that the KIBS related activities represent significant spatial concentration in the urban centres, especially in Bucharest. The concentration of KIBS-related local units were significant in several Romanian counties: Brașov, Cluj, Constanța, Ilfov, Sibiu and Timiș (these counties and Bucharest contain almost 60 percent of the KIBS-related local units in Romania in 2013) and this territorial pattern is completely overlapped by the results of the multivariate cluster analysis. Different factors of KIBS are analysed by factor analysis, setting the KIBS-related indicator into the first component named ’Economic prosperity’ with different development and infrastructural indicators. The research also reveals a strong correlation among the development indicators that predicts the significant spatial disparities from the respect of KIBS.

5000|$|For {{the most}} part, {{each of the}} present {{autonomous}} communities in Spain can be treated individually, with only minor <b>territorial</b> <b>differences</b> as one looks into the past. There are some instances in which certain groups or divisions need to be indicated. First, the autonomous communities which made up the former Crown of Aragon (Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, and the Balearic Islands) can be treated with slightly more unity when dealing with the past than when dealing with the present. [...] However, {{over the past century}} or so, the notion of the “Catalan Countries” has taken hold. The concepts of the Crown of Aragon and the Catalan Countries will be dealt with more specifically in their own section, and, though they cover similar territories, they occupy different places in time and therefore need to be treated separately. Another significant large former entity, already alluded to, is that of Castile proper. Though the Crown of Castile encompassed many of these areas for a long time, New Castile (Castile-La Mancha and Madrid, and Old Castile (eastern Castile and León) are the only parts of the Crown of Castile which can be considered integral to nuclear Castile and which share many qualities. The last key super-region is that of the Basque Country in its larger sense (composed of The Autonomous Community of the Basque Country, Navarre, and the Northern Basque Country which is in France.

40|$|In {{territorial}} {{animals that}} hide to avoid predators, a predatory attack creates a conflict because a hiding animal cannot defend its territory from conspecific intruders. When intruders are persistent, a past conspecific intrusion informs a territorial resident that future intrusions {{by the same}} animal are likely. Using a mathematical model, I examine the effects that past territorial intrusions can have on antipredator behaviour. Past territorial intrusions rarely affect a resident animal's time to hide (the optimal behaviour is to hide {{as soon as the}} predator initiates its attack). In contrast, past intrusions should shorten the length of time during which territory holders remain in hiding, with the magnitude of this effect depending on the time of the predator's attack, the re-intruder's pattern of return, and the intrusion rates of other conspecifics. The results of the model show that we need more information on patterns of re-intruders' behaviour, and emphasize that a similar functional explanation could underlie other behavioural changes following territorial and/or aggressive encounters (such as winner/loser effects or changes in display frequency and <b>territorial</b> vigilance). <b>Differences</b> between my findings and those from previous studies suggest that the trade-off between antipredator behaviour and territorial defence can involve different costs from the trade-off between antipredator behaviour and foraging...|$|R
