40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was the {{feasibility}} study of a particular architecture of a digital signal processing machine operating in real time which could do in a pipeline fashion the computation of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of a time-domain sampled complex digital data stream. The particular architecture makes use of simple identical processors (called inner product processors) in a linear organization called a systolic array. Through computer simulation the new architecture to compute the FFT with systolic arrays was proved to be viable, and computed the FFT correctly and with the predicted particulars of operation. Integrated circuits to compute the operations expected of the vital node of the systolic architecture were proven feasible, and even with a 2 <b>micron</b> <b>VLSI</b> <b>technology</b> can execute the required operations in the required time. Actual construction of the integrated circuits was successful in one variant (fixed point) and unsuccessful in the other (floating point) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss a}} new class of Micro Pattern Gas Detectors, the Gas Pixel Detector (GPD), in which a {{complete}} integration between the gas amplification structure and the read-out electronics has been reached. An Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) built in deep sub-micron technology has been developed to realize a monolithic device that is, at the same time, the pixelized charge collecting electrode and the amplifying, shaping and charge measuring front-end electronics. The CMOS chip has the top metal layer patterned in a matrix of 80 micron pitch hexagonal pixels, each of them directly connected to the underneath electronics chain which has been realized in the remaining five layers of the 0. 35 <b>micron</b> <b>VLSI</b> <b>technology.</b> Results from tests of a first prototype of such detector with 2 k pixels and a full scale version with 22 k pixels are presented. The application of this device for Astronomical X-Ray Polarimetry is discussed. The experimental detector response to polarized and unpolarized X-ray radiation is shown. Results from a full MonteCarlo simulation for two astronomical sources, the Crab Nebula and the Hercules X 1, are also reported.

40|$|We {{report on}} a large active area (15 x 15 mm 2), high channel density (470 pixels/mm 2), self-triggering CMOS analog chip that we have {{developed}} as pixelized charge collecting electrode of a Micropattern Gas Detector. This device, which represents a big step forward {{both in terms of}} size and performance, is the last version of three generations of custom ASICs of increasing complexity. The CMOS pixel array has the top metal layer patterned in a matrix of 105600 hexagonal pixels at 50 micron pitch. Each pixel is directly connected to the underneath full electronics chain which has been realized in the remaining five metal and two poly-silicon layers of a 0. 18 <b>micron</b> <b>VLSI</b> <b>technology.</b> The chip has customizable self-triggering capability and includes a signal pre-processing function for the automatic localization of the event coordinates. In this way it is possible to reduce significantly the readout time and the data volume by limiting the signal output only to those pixels belonging to the region of interest. The very small pixel area and the use of a deep sub-micron CMOS technology has brought the noise down to 50 electrons ENC. Results from in depth tests of this device when coupled to a fine pitch (50 micron on a triangular pattern) Gas Electron Multiplier are presented. The matching of readout and gas amplification pitch allows to get optimal results. The application of this detector for Astronomical X-Ray Polarimetry is discussed. The experimental detector response to polarized and unpolarized X-ray radiation when working with two gas mixtures and two different photon energies is shown. Results from a full MonteCarlo simulation for several galactic and extragalactic atronomical sources are also reported.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 30 -November 02, 1995 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaTo support {{initiatives}} for cheaper, faster, better ground telemetry systems, the Data Systems Technology Division (DSTD) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center {{is developing}} a new Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) targeted to dramatically {{lower the cost of}} telemetry frame synchronization. This single VLSI device, known as the Parallel Integrated Frame Synchronizer (PIFS) chip, integrates most of the functionality contained in high density 9 U VME card frame synchronizer subsystems currently in use. In 1987, a first generation 20 Mbps VMEBus frame synchronizer based on 2. 0 <b>micron</b> CMOS <b>VLSI</b> <b>technology</b> was developed by Data Systems Technology Division. In 1990, this subsystem architecture was recast using 0. 8 micron ECL & GaAs VLSI to achieve 300 Mbps performance. The PIFS chip, based on 0. 7 micron CMOS technology, will provide a superset of the current VMEBus subsystem functions at rates up to 500 Mbps at approximately one-tenth current replication costs. Functions performed by this third generation device include true and inverted 64 bit marker correlation with programmable error tolerances, programmable frame length and marker patterns, programmable search-check-lock-flywheel acquisition strategy, slip detection, and CRC error detection. Acquired frames can optionally be annotated with quality trailer and time stamp. A comprehensive set of cumulative accounting registers are provided on-chip for data quality monitoring. Prototypes of the PIFS chip are expected in October 1995. This paper will describe the architecture and implementation of this new low-cost high functionality device...|$|R

40|$|Oscillators are {{integral}} part of many electronic systems. An oscillator is an electronic device used {{for the purpose of}} generating a signal. Applications range from clock generation in microprocessors to carrier synthesis in cellular telephones, requiring vastly different oscillators topologies and performance parameters. Robust, high performance oscillator design in CMOS technology continues to pose interesting challenges.
