5000|$|The 10 million federally-funded Bega to Yellow Pinch Dam Water <b>Transfer</b> <b>Pipeline</b> and pumping {{stations}} {{provides an}} additional {{source of water}} to secure water supplies for the Bega Valley Shire. The project commenced in 2007 and involved {{the construction of a}} high lift pump station, capable of pumping up to [...] per day from the lower Bega River and Bega borefields. This water is carried through a 20 km pipeline to Yellow Pinch Dam. The benefits of the project include the protection of low environmental flows at Tantawanglo Creek by extracting and storing larger volumes of water during high Bega River flows; the increased security of supply to townships in the south of the Bega Valley Shire through the use of water from the lower Bega River; and providesfor greater flexibility and availability of water for landholder extraction in the upper catchment.|$|E
50|$|Phase 3 was {{announced}} in May 2007 to increase storage, ship unloading and vapourisation capabilities. A fourth 190,000 m3 LNG storage tank was constructed {{to the east of}} the three existing tanks. A second jetty (Jetty No. 8) was constructed on the River Medway (after demolition of the former jetty 8) together with an associated cryogenic pipeline to the existing <b>transfer</b> <b>pipeline.</b> The jetty has three 16-inch loading arms and a 16-inch vapour return arm. The jetty is capable of handling LNG tankers of 125,000 to 266,000 m3 cargo capacity (QMax). The 36-inch diameter 4.5 km nickel-steel pipeline has a flexible polyurethane (PUR) foam insulation in a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) casing, the line transfers LNG between the jetty and the storage sites. There is also a 14-inch recirculation line. Additional facilities included further submerged combustion vapourisers; boil-off gas compressors; nitrogen facilities; and a vent stack. The development provided an additional five million tonnes of capacity per annum. All this capacity was contracted out from December 2010. Customers included BP, Iberdrola, Sonatrach, Centrica, E.ON and GDF Suez.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Solid [...] liquid dispersions {{are widely}} {{encountered}} in many industrial processes, especially in chemical engineering (thermal energy transportation, process plant <b>transfer</b> <b>pipelines,</b> catalytic reactors, fluidized beds, etc.). Different cases may be distinguished, {{according to many}} factors such as: particle type (colloidal or not), monodisperse or polydisperse particle distributions, particle concentrations, density higher or {{lower than that of}} the carrier fluid, viscosity of the liquid, laminar or turbulent flow regime (Shook and Roco, 1991). The flow patterns associated give rise to highly heterogeneous flows for which the study is far from complete. The substantial lack of experimental data does not facilitate the elaboration of models to predict flow patterns or pressure drops. Satisfactory modelling involves correct predictions of solid [...] liquid (particle [...] fluid or wall [...] fluid) and solid [...] solid (particle [...] particle or wall [...] particle) interactions in the flow mixture.

40|$|Despite over 50 {{years of}} {{experience}} in transporting radioactive tank wastes to and from equipment and tanks at the Department of Energy's Hanford, Savannah River, and Oak Ridge sites, waste slurry <b>transfer</b> <b>pipelines</b> and process piping become plugged on occasion. At Hanford, several tank farm pipelines are no longer in service because of plugs. At Savannah River, solid deposits in the outlet line of the 2 H evaporator have resulted in an unplanned extended downtime. Although waste transfer criteria and guidelines intended to prevent pipeline plugging are in place, they are not always adequate. To avoid pipeline plugging in the future, other factors that are not currently embodied in the transfer criteria may need to be considered. The work summarized here is being conducted to develop {{a better understanding of the}} chemical and waste flow dynamics during waste transfer.

40|$|Competition on today’s {{market is}} fierce. Providing a defect-free product {{is no more}} a {{competitive}} advantage. Now money and focus is put on managing the supply chain, a competitive tool to thriving in today’s business climate. There are two distinct flow pipelines: the order information <b>transfer</b> <b>pipeline</b> and the product <b>transfer</b> <b>pipeline,</b> both dependent on the collaboration efforts of individuals. Evolving within supply chain management equals integrating the supply chain from basic to complex; from baseline or functional to internal or external. Bringing focus to where it {{is found to be}} lacking, this literary study highlights and connects issues that may arise during implementation of external supply chain integration. The focal point is thus on employee reactions to change, with each stage of implementation that the implementation issues connect to. Simultaneously, the study provides (pre) requisites to management during the different stages, which would support the implemented transition in its different phases. The result of this study is a Manger Model that gives an overview of each of the implementation stages, the requisites for management and issues regarding employees at each of the stages. Constructed to be applicable to more than just external integration the model encompasses all the gathered models and theories through a discussion of not only the complexity of the internal and the external supply chain, but also the complex nature of the individuals caught within the implementation, both from the manager’s as well as the employee’s point of view...|$|E

In addition, we present a fast splatting-based radiance transfer precomputation method and an early-evaluation technique for real-time radiance estimation in the clustered PCA space.

40|$|The usual {{perspective}} on technology spillovers from FDI sees the MNC subsidiary as a passive actor. It presumes that the technological superiority that spreads from subsidiaries to other {{firms in the}} host economy is initially created outside it by MNC parent companies, and is delivered to subsidiaries via international technology transfer. The role of subsidiaries {{is little more than}} to act as a ‘leaky container’ lying between the technology <b>transfer</b> <b>pipeline</b> and the absorption of spillovers by domestic firms. This paper suggests a different model in which a substantial part of the potential for spillover is created within local subsidiaries {{as a result of their}} own knowledge-creating and accumulating activities in the host economy. We explore empirically the effects of these activities on technology spillovers from FDI using data for industrial firms in Argentina over the period 1992 – 96. The analysis suggests that significant results can be obtained incorporating subsidiaries' own technological activities as an explanatory variable of the spillover process...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{production}} and transportation of petroleum uids will be severely aected by the deposition of suspended particles (i. e. asphaltenes, diamondoids, paran/wax, sand, etc.) in petroleum uid production wells and/or <b>transfer</b> <b>pipelines.</b> In certain instances, {{the amount of}} precipitation is rather large causing complete fouling of these conduits. Therefore, {{it is important to}} understand the behavior of suspended particles during petroleum uid ow conditions. In this paper, we present an analytical model for the prefouling behavior of suspended particles corresponding to petroleum uids production conditions. We predict the rate of particle deposition during various turbulent ow regimes. The turbulent boundary layer theory and the concepts of mass transfer are utilized to model and calculate the particle deposition rates on the walls of owing conduits. The developed model accounts for the eddy diusivity and Brownian diusivity as well as for inertial eects. The analysis presented in this paper shows that rates of particle deposition (during petroleum uid production) on the walls of the owing channel due solely to diusional eects are small. It is also shown that deposition rates decrease with increasing particle size. However, when the process is momentum controlled (large particle sizes), higher deposition rates are expected...|$|R
