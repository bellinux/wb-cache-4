The two large cocks could not be prevailed on <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>out</b> of the hand by any means. Under the strong influence of temptation they would strut with bold aspect, but timid, hesitating step, towards the proffered crumb, but the slightest motion would scare them away; and when they did venture to peck, they did so with violent haste, and instantly fled in abject terror.|$|E

60|$|I think I {{was now in}} the twenty-third year of my reign, and my {{thoughts}} much easier than formerly, having contrived several pretty amusements and diversions to pass away the time in a pleasant manner. By this time my pretty Poll had learned to speak English, and pronounce his words very articulately and plain; so that for many hours we used to chat together after a familiar manner, and {{he lived with me}} no less than twenty-six years. My dog which was nineteen years old, sixteen of which he lived with me, died some time ago of mere old age. As for my cats, they multiplied so fast, that I was forced to kill or drive them into the woods, except two or three which became my particular favourites. Besides these, I continually kept two or three household kids about me, which I learned <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>out</b> of my hand, and two more parrots which could talk indifferently, and call Robinson Crusoe, but not so excellently as the first, as not taking that pains with them. I had also several sea-owls which I had wounded and cut their wings; and growing tame, they used to breed among the low trees about my castle walls, all which made my abode very agreeable.|$|E
60|$|On a {{warm and}} sunny May afternoon, some ten months since Yeovil's return from his Siberian wanderings and sickness, Cicely sat at a small table in the open-air {{restaurant}} in Hyde Park, finishing her after-luncheon coffee {{and listening to the}} meritorious performance of the orchestra. Opposite her sat Larry Meadowfield, absorbed for the moment in the slow enjoyment of a cigarette, which also was not without its short-lived merits. Larry was a well-dressed youngster, who was, in Cicely's opinion, distinctly good to look on--an opinion which the boy himself obviously shared. He had the healthy, well-cared-for appearance of a country-dweller who {{has been turned into a}} town dandy without suffering in the process. His blue- black hair, growing very low down on a broad forehead, was brushed back in a smoothness that gave his head the appearance of a rain-polished sloe; his eyebrows were two dark smudges and his large violet-grey eyes expressed the restful good temper of an animal whose immediate requirements have been satisfied. The lunch had been an excellent one, and it was jolly <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>out</b> of doors in the warm spring air--the only drawback to the arrangement being the absence of mirrors. However, if he could not look at himself a great many people could look at him.|$|E
6000|$|The downland shepherds, Caleb said, were {{as a rule}} clever poachers; and it {{is really}} not surprising, when one {{considers}} the temptation to {{a man with a}} wife and several hungry children, besides himself and a dog, <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>out</b> of about seven shillings a week. But old Bawcombe was an exception: he would take no game, furred or feathered, nor, if he could prevent it, allow another to take anything from the land fed by his flock. Caleb and his brothers, when as boys and youths they began their shepherding, sometimes caught a rabbit, or their dog caught and killed one without their encouragement; but, however the thing came into their hands, they could not take it home on account of their father. Now it happened that an elderly gentleman who had the shooting was a keen sportsman, and that in several successive years he found a wonderful difference in the amount of game at one spot among the hills and in all the rest of his hill property. The only explanation the keeper could give was that Isaac Bawcombe tended his flock on that down where rabbits, hares, and partridges were so plentiful. One autumn day the gentleman was shooting over that down, and seeing a big man in a smock-frock standing motionless, crook in hand, regarding him, he called out to his keeper, who was with him, [...] "Who is that big man?" [...] and was told that it was Shepherd Bawcombe. The old gentleman pulled some money {{out of his pocket and}} said, [...] "Give him this half-crown, and thank him for the good sport I've had to-day." [...] But after the coin had been given the giver still remained standing there, thinking, perhaps, that he had not yet sufficiently rewarded the man; and at last, before turning away, he shouted, [...] "Bawcombe, that's not all. You'll get something more by and by." ...|$|E

6000|$|The Glengaber burn {{is about}} twenty miles from any railway station, but, {{on the last}} {{occasion}} when I visited it, three louts were worming their way up it, within twenty yards of each other, each lout, with his huge rod, showing himself wholly to any trout that might {{be left in the}} water. Thirty years ago the burns that feed St. Mary's Loch were almost unfished, and rare sport we had in them, as boys, staying at Tibbie Sheil's famous cottage, and sleeping in her box-beds, where so often the Ettrick Shepherd and Christopher North have lain, after copious toddy. [...] "'Tis gone, 'tis gone:" [...] not in our time will any man, like the Ettrick Shepherd, need a cart to carry the trout he has slain in Meggat Water. That stream, flowing through a valley furnished with a grass-grown track for a road, flows, as I said, into St. Mary's Loch. There are two or three large pools {{at the foot of the}} loch, in which, as a small boy hardly promoted to fly, I have seen many monsters rising greedily. Men got into the way of fishing these pools after a flood with minnow, and thereby made huge baskets, the big fish running up <b>to</b> <b>feed,</b> <b>out</b> of the loch. But, when last I rowed past Meggat foot, the delta of that historic stream was simply crowded with anglers, stepping in in front of each other. I asked if this mob was a political [...] "demonstration," [...] but they stuck to business, as if they had been on the Regent's Canal. And this, remember, was twenty miles from any town! Yet there is a burn on the Border still undiscovered, still full of greedy trout. I shall give the angler such a hint of its whereabouts as Tiresias, in Hades, gave to Odysseus concerning the end of his second wanderings.|$|E
60|$|I {{was now in}} my twenty-third year of {{residence}} in this island, and was so naturalized to the place, and to the manner of living, that could I have but enjoyed the certainty that no savages {{would come to the}} place to disturb me, I could have been content to have capitulated for spending the rest of my time there, even to the last moment, till I had laid me down and died, like the old goat, in the cave: I had also arrived to some little diversions and amusements, which made the time pass more pleasantly with me a great deal than it did before; as, first, I had taught my Pol, as I noted before, to speak; and he did it so familiarly, and talked so articulately and plain, that it was very pleasant to me; and he lived with me no less than six-and-twenty years: how long he might live afterwards I knew not; though I know they have a notion in the Brasils, that they live an hundred years; perhaps some of my Polls may be alive there still, calling after poor Robin Crusoe to this day; I wish no Englishman the ill luck to come there and hear them; but if he did, he would certainly believe it was the devil.

60|$|But {{the little}} Dwarf {{knew nothing of}} all this. He liked {{the birds and the}} lizards immensely, and thought that the flowers were the most marvellous things in the whole world, except of course the Infanta, but then she had given him the {{beautiful}} white rose, and she loved him, and that made a great difference. How he wished that he had gone back with her! She would have put him on her right hand, and smiled at him, and he would have never left her side, but would have made her his playmate, and taught her all kinds of delightful tricks. For though he had never been in a palace before, he knew a great many wonderful things. He could make little cages out of rushes for the grasshoppers to sing in, and fashion the long jointed bamboo into the pipe that Pan loves to hear. He knew the cry of every bird, and could call the starlings from the tree-top, or the heron from the mere. He knew the trail of every animal, and could track the hare by its delicate footprints, and the boar by the trampled leaves. All the wild- dances he knew, the mad dance in red raiment with the autumn, the light dance in blue sandals over the corn, the dance with white snow-wreaths in winter, and the blossom-dance through the orchards in spring. He knew where the wood-pigeons built their nests, and once when a fowler had snared the parent birds, he had brought up the young ones himself, and had built a little dovecot for them in the cleft of a pollard elm. They were quite tame, and used <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>out</b> of his hands every morning. She would like them, and the rabbits that scurried about in the long fern, and the jays with their steely feathers and black bills, and the hedgehogs that could curl themselves up into prickly balls, and the great wise tortoises that crawled slowly about, shaking their heads and nibbling at the young leaves. Yes, she must certainly come to the forest and play with him. He would give her his own little bed, and would watch outside the window till dawn, to see that the wild horned cattle did not harm her, nor the gaunt wolves creep too near the hut. And at dawn he would tap at the shutters and wake her, and they would go out and dance together all the day long. It was really not a bit lonely in the forest. Sometimes a Bishop rode through on his white mule, reading out of a painted book. Sometimes in their green velvet caps, and their jerkins of tanned deerskin, the falconers passed by, with hooded hawks on their wrists. At vintage-time came the grape-treaders, with purple hands and feet, wreathed with glossy ivy and carrying dripping skins of wine; and the charcoal-burners sat round their huge braziers at night, watching the dry logs charring slowly in the fire, and roasting chestnuts in the ashes, and the robbers came out of their caves and made merry with them. Once, too, he had seen a beautiful procession winding up the long dusty road to Toledo. The monks went in front singing sweetly, and carrying bright banners and crosses of gold, and then, in silver armour, with matchlocks and pikes, came the soldiers, and in their midst walked three barefooted men, in strange yellow dresses painted all over with wonderful figures, and carrying lighted candles in their hands. Certainly {{there was a great deal}} to look at in the forest, and when she was tired he would find a soft bank of moss for her, or carry her in his arms, for he was very strong, though he knew that he was not tall. He would make her a necklace of red bryony berries, that would be quite as pretty as the white berries that she wore on her dress, and when she was tired of them, she could throw them away, and he would find her others. He would bring her acorn-cups and dew-drenched anemones, and tiny glow-worms to be stars in the pale gold of her hair.|$|E

Pigs were fed ad libitum, fasted for 24 h, or fasted for 48 h, and within each of these 3 groups the effect of no medication (controls), of 20 mg or 40 mg of omeprazole was evaluated on the pH of gastric fluid and {{the presence or absence}} of lesions in the pars esophagea. Medication with 40 mg of omeprazole resulted in significantly higher gastric pH 24 h after treatment compared with untreated pigs or pigs medicated with 20 mg of omeprazole.

50|$|Early {{versions}} of the cam systems used a Gibbs-style type 1 ascender placed in an inverted position attached to a soloer's sit harness opposite to the manufacturer's intended use. The combination of a climber's body position in a fall and friction between the ascender frame and the rope provides the activating leverage for the cam to grab the rope. Fall forces generated using this device and the cam profile can be enough to damage a rope due to the high clamp loads induced by the cam lever arm.

The theoretical part deals with the food intake disorder. It describes the development, causes, reasons, diagnostic criteria, etiology, a process and a treatment of anorexia nervosa and bulimy. It also considers the way of the perception of one's own body-body image. The second part includes my own research that is directed to the children at primary schools (at the age of 6 to 10) with the aim to discover their nutrituous habits, attitudes to eating and satisfaction with their own body.

On 9 February 1815 an advertisement appeared in the Times from a self-described [...] "young Gentlewoman", offering to be the Pig-faced Lady's companion in return for [...] "a handsome income yearly, and a premium for residing with her 7 years". The advertisement was published, but a week later a prospective advertisement from a young man wishing to propose marriage to the Pig-faced Lady prompted the Times to denounce the rumour, comparing believers in the Pig-faced Lady to the followers of the (recently deceased) self-proclaimed prophet Joanna Southcott. There is at present a report, in London, of a woman, with a strangely deformed face, resembling that of a pig, who is possessed of a large fortune, and we suppose wants all the comforts and conveniences incident toward her sex and station. We, ourselves, unwittingly put in an advertisement from a young woman, offering herself to be her companion; and yesterday morning, a fellow (with a calf's head, we suppose) transmitted to us another advertisement, attended by a one pound note, offering himself to be her husband. We have put his offer in the fire, and shall send his money to some charity, thinking it a pity that such a fool should have any. Our rural friends hardly know what idiots London contains. The pig's face is as firmly believed in by many as Joanna [...] pregnancy, to which folly it has succeeded. Though no Parson Tozer has as yet mounted the rostrum to preach in support of the face, there is hardly a company in which this swinish female is not talked of; and thousands believe in her existence. The story, however, is an old one. About 50 years ago, it is well recollected by several elderly people, there was exactly the same rumour. It was revived with but slight effect about 30 years since; and now comes forth again in its pristine vigour. On the original invention of the pig-faced woman, about the year 1764, a man offered himself to make her an ivory trough <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>out</b> of; which can only be considered as a feeble type of the silver cradle actually presented in our day. Besides, there was but one actor in the first folly, and there have been twenty in the latter.|$|E
40|$|At the {{department}} of Space and Plasma Physics a small wire boom system has been developed. The system’s cable is stored around a stationary cylinder. The system uses a gear <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>out</b> the cable in an axial direction. The purpose is to measure the electric and magnetic fields in the ionosphere. The wire boom system has had problems with the functionality and friction. In the REXUS 10 project, the system concept was to be proven through a space flight. This Master’s Thesis describes the process of bringing the Boom system from concept to a fully functional and flight proven physical model. The results {{came in the form}} of a successful space flight, where two of the four systems deployed and retracted successfully. Another important result was the identification of and solution for, areas of the concept that are critical for its design, manufacturing and function...|$|E
40|$|This {{method of}} storage for wet distillers’ grain proved to be very {{effective}} with a total shrink of 9. 0 % from purchase to feeding. The 80 / 20 blend proved to work well in the storage bag and was eagerly and readily consumed with little to no waste by {{a large number of}} fall calving, mature, lactating Angus females. The storage aspects of the modified distillers’ grain with solubles in the bag seem to be different than the wet distillers’ grain and hay mixture. Tendencies for spoilage in the modified product seemed greater with molds occurring (Picture 4). Total shrink from purchase <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>out</b> was 16. 7 %. However, this product, in spite of the shrink, was successfully stored and fed for over 200 days. Cost analysis indicated that utilizing bagging procedures may not be a competitive methodology, therefore, lower cost storage systems need further research...|$|E

CNN reported that it generated more than 21million video streams by 3:30pmEST that day—an all-time record, in addition to receiving 136million page views that day. At one point during the surge of traffic to view the Obama inauguration, the BBC reported downtime during its own live video feed at its website. The heavy website traffic caused the BBC video <b>feed</b> <b>to</b> cut <b>out</b> for 30minutes, with web visitors seeing the message [...] "Please come back later" [...] instead of the live video footage.|$|R

40|$|The {{amount of}} food {{available}} to a plankton-feeding animal is deter mined by the concentration of suitable food material in the water, and by {{the rate of the}} animal's feeding activity. The calanoid copepods, like many other zooplanktonts, are generally considered <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> by filtering <b>out</b> particles from a current of water generated by the animals (Cannon, 1928). By determining the number of food organisms re moved by an animal from a suspension of known concentration, the volume of water which has been filtered clear of the organisms can be calculated and, if the chemical composition of the organisms be known, the amount of nutriment made available to the animal may be esti mated. Preliminary measurements of the filtering rate of Calanus finmarchicus have been reported by Fuller and Clarke (1936). Further investigation of changes in the feeding rate induced by varying environ mental factors of ecological importance was expected to yield informa tion useful in the quantitative study of aquatic food cycles.
