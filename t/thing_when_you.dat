25|$|The Bigfoot {{researchers}} {{say that no}} human can walk that way in the film. Oh, yes they can! When you're wearing long clown's feet, you can't place the ball of your foot down first. You have to put your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another <b>thing,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> put on the gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe {{a quarter of the}} way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E

It's just a great <b>thing</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> can make a kid smile that's going through some hard times in life... I wish more people, not just athletes, would give people {{just a little bit of}} their time. It doesn't take much... It can make a huge difference." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 8, 2005, Governor Schwarzenegger held a clemency hearing. The one-hour, closed-door meeting {{took place}} as a crowd {{consisting}} of both supporters of Williams and proponents of capital punishment congregated outside the Capitol in Sacramento. Schwarzenegger described the decision whether to grant clemency as [...] "the toughest <b>thing</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are governor, dealing with someone's life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't quite understand," [...] {{answered}} Mrs Massey, {{cutting in}} at this point with a laugh, [...] "but I'm quite sure it's better to say <b>things</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> don't mean them, than to mean <b>things</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> don't say them!" ...|$|R

2500|$|Meno asks Socrates: [...] "And {{how will}} you inquire into a <b>thing</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are wholly ignorant of what it is? Even {{if you happen to}} bump right into it, {{how will you}} know it is the thing you didn't know?" [...] Socrates rephrases the question, which has come to be the {{canonical}} statement of the paradox: [...] " [...] man cannot search either for what he knows or for what he does not know He cannot search for what he knows--since he knows it, {{there is no need to}} search--nor for what he does not know, for he does not know what to look for." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2010, before Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit {{was set to}} take {{center stage}} at EA's press conference during Gamescom, it was {{announced}} by art director Henry LaBounta that Criterion collaborated with Battlefield creators EA Digital Illusions CE (DICE) in building the massive open world of Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit. Early in November 2010, Patrick Söderlund, Senior Vice President of EA Games Europe, said this of the collaboration: [...] "I {{think the most important}} <b>thing,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have two high-quality developers working together, for it to work, they need to have mutual respect. They need to have that respect, to say ‘Ok, we trust you to do this.’ This was a case where that was so obvious, where the Criterion team had a full trust in the DICE team to do what they were doing, and vice versa." ...|$|E

2500|$|Australian quadruple Olympic {{gold medal}} winning swimmer Dawn Fraser called for Australia {{to boycott the}} games event, citing fears of a tragedy similar to that which {{unfolded}} in the Munich Olympics of 1972. Fraser pronounced that reports of missed construction deadlines and other irregularities in games planning meant Indian authorities' [...] "word for providing security {{should not be taken}} at its face value." [...] However, the Australian Commonwealth Games Organising Committee was quick to dismiss Fraser's fears with ACGA chief executive, Perry Crosswhite saying he believed there will be no security issues during the games event. John Coates, Australia's Olympic chief, came down hard on the organisers, alleging teams were being forced to temporary accommodation at hotels. [...] "I don't think it is a cultural <b>thing.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> agree to host , you are required to provide the basics in terms of health and hygiene for the athletes. The Games shouldn't have been awarded to Delhi in hindsight." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many critics {{considered}} the song a [...] "diss" [...] towards Lil' Kim, [...] {{who has been}} in disputes with Minaj since the beginning of her career. Mariel Concepcion of Billboard dissected the song stating [...] "Nicki Minaj's highly-talked about [...] "Roman's Revenge" [...] track hit the net over the weekend, and the Harajuku Barbie appears to be taking jabs at Lil' Kim." [...] In the first verse Minaj takes shots saying [...] "Look at my show footage how these girls be spazzing/So fuck I look like getting back to a has-been/Yeah I said it has-been/hang it up/flatscreen" [...] then again [...] "You out of work/I know it's tough/but enough is enough/" [...] Minaj then specifically takes jabs at Baltimore rapper Keys and Lil'Kim in the second verse rapping, [...] "Is this the thanks that I get for putting you bitches on/ is it my fault that all of you bitches gone/" [...] and following this line this infered she was talking about Lil' Kim [...] "Nicki she just mad cause you took the spot/ word that bitch mad cause I took the spot/ Well bitch if you aint shitting then get off the pot/Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off ya top/. Minaj also subliminally took jabs at rapper Keys with [...] "I see them dusty ass Filas, Levi's/ Raggedy Ann's/ Holes in your knee highs". Lil' Kim fired back at the song at a club-concert, stating [...] "I will erase this bitch’s social security number. First of all, I don’t even need a record right now and I’d kill that bitch with my old shit. My records ain’t just enter the charts, they made history. What the fuck is this bullshit, this shit come and go!" [...] Minaj later stated in an interview on The Wendy Williams Show that, [...] "They know what I'm talking about. See that's the <b>thing</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> put out records; you know only the 'guilty ones' feel like you're talking about them. So you know, if you have nothing to worry about, if you haven't came out saying stuff, if you never came out saying your ungrateful bullshit then you wouldn't worry about it." ...|$|E
