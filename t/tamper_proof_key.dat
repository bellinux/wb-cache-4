40|$|SUMMARY <b>Tamper</b> <b>proofing</b> is {{a crucial}} problem in the {{watermarking}} application. Aiming at the credibility of multimedia, we present a semi-fragile watermark based on the image permutation. Watermarking detection is performed without resorting to the host image {{and it is only}} controlled by secrete keys, thus the whole scheme does not have certain security gaps. The simulation experiments show that it can survive the JPEG compression and effectively specify the region of the image that has been modified maliciously. <b>key</b> words: watermark, <b>tamper</b> <b>proofing,</b> permutation, transform, semifragile 1...|$|R

The purpose of the identity theft is to facilitate the intellectual property theft. Without it the intellectual property theft would be obvious and the products would be confiscated and destroyed. Authentication solutions, to prevent identity theft, were then developed for the two categories of {{manufactured goods}} i. e. goods which can be subjected to destructive screening strategies and goods which cannot e. g. pharmaceutical drugs and currencies, respectively. The solutions developed {{were found to be}} analogous to digital signatures. <b>Tamper</b> <b>proof</b> packaging on pharmaceutical drugs is analogous to encryption because it prevents Mallory from interfering with the product. Breaking the <b>tamper</b> <b>proof</b> packaging is a one-way function. Concealed inside the packaging a one-time password, which can be used to authenticate the product over the internet. The name of the authentication website must be common knowledge, just like a public key for authenticating digital signatures. Otherwise the counterfeiters will specify their own authentication website. This solution can be altered for currencies i. e. the one-way function, equivalent to opening the <b>tamper</b> <b>proof</b> packaging, becomes the method of manufacture of the currency.

40|$|The recent {{information}} technology development has vastly helped in accelerating and facilitating the banking services and operations in general. In {{spite of this}} accelerated development in the banking sector, the risk of invading electronic banking systems is evident. This is manifested in many harmful functions such as unauthorised money transfer, disclosure of client information, denial of online banking services as well as various threats linked with online banking at different lineages especially through authentication of the client online. This thesis utilizes cloud computing in the banking system from technological and economic perspectives, and the possible benefits that a cloud computing provider gives. The definitions and functions of enterprise architecture both for cloud computing and the financial sector are discussed, then the new architecture model that I developed by merging the cloud and e-banking architectures is thoroughly explained. This study presents a novel, unique <b>tamper</b> <b>proof</b> USB, sustained with an operating system dedicated to serve the bank’s clients. This device is realised by embedding the bank application in this <b>tamper</b> <b>proof</b> USB while creating an isolation layer in the client’s PC when the client plugs in this USB. The modified operating system platform {{is based on the}} puppy Linux operating system. It has the capability to multiplex physical resources at the granularity of an entire operating system while being able to provide isolation between different operating systems. This <b>tamper</b> <b>proof</b> device is supported by four authentication measures which are; unique <b>tamper</b> <b>proof</b> ID, User account, password and fingerprint with a client secure socket layer. Moreover, I designed two different channels, one with cloud for authentication and transferring an encrypted session key while the other channel is used for communication between the client and the bank after re-authentication accompanied by a one-time password and finger printer image authentication parameter plus session key. The simulation testbed is used to solve the fundamental flow of the mechanism in sufficient detail, using Network Miner to parse libpcap files to do a live packet capture of the network traffic between cloud provider and the client; using Foglight monitoring tools to utilise the simulated server. Netwalk tools are used to represent the percentage of IP usage and Kali Linux, wireshark for penetration testing.

Such <b>tamper</b> <b>proofing</b> can be applied in authentications for courtroom evidence, insurance claims, copyright claims and journalistic photography. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of digital watermarking in the digital camera environment using a fragile watermark embedded in the discrete wavelet domain of the images. We propose an architecture to implement the scheme under the constraints of the digital camera environment, such as with a limited computation power. We also evaluate the versatility of the scheme to detect and characterize signal modifications from a number of distortions, such as substitution of data, filtering, and lossy compression, through software simulation. Results show that the proposed scheme is feasible and effective for authentication of images taken by digital cameras. © 2005 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of digital watermarking to ensure the credibility of multimedia. We specifically {{address the problem of}} fragile digital watermarking for the <b>tamper</b> <b>proofing</b> of still images. Applications of our problem include authentication for courtroom evidence, insurance claims, and journalistic photography. We present a novel fragile watermarking approach which embeds a watermark in the discrete wavelet domain of the image by quantizing the corresponding coefficients. Tamper detection is possible in localized spatial and frequency regions. Unlike previously proposed techniques, this novel approach provides information on specific frequencies of the image that have been modified. This allows the user to make application-dependent decisions concerning whether an image, which is JPEG compressed for instance, still has credibility. Analysis is provided to evaluate the performance of the technique to varying system parameters. In addition, we compare the performance of the proposed method to existing fragile watermarking techniques to demonstrate the success and potential of the method for practical multimedia <b>tamper</b> <b>proofing</b> and authentication...|$|R

40|$|The Universal Composability {{framework}} {{was introduced}} by Canetti to study the security of protocols which are concurrently executed with other protocols in a network environment. Unfortunately it was shown that in the so called plain model, a large class of functionalities cannot be securely realized. These severe impossibility results motivated the study of other models involving some sort of setup assumptions, where general positive results can be obtained. Until recently, all the setup assumptions which were proposed required some trusted third party (or parties). Katz recently proposed using a physical setup to avoid such trusted setup assumptions. In his model, the physical setup phase includes the parties exchanging <b>tamper</b> <b>proof</b> hardware tokens implementing some functionality.

40|$|Secure hybrid robust {{watermarking}} resistant against tampering and copy-attack DEGUILLAUME, Frédéric, VOLOSHYNOVSKYY, Svyatoslav, PUN, Thierry Digital watermarking appears {{today as}} an efficient mean of securing multimedia documents. Several application scenarios {{in the security}} of digital watermarking have been pointed out, each of them with different requirements. The three main identified scenarios are: copyright protection, i. e. protecting ownership and usage rights; <b>tamper</b> <b>proofing,</b> aiming at detecting malicious modifications; and authentication, the purpose {{of which is to}} check the authenticity of the originator of a document. While robust watermarks, which survive to any change or alteration of the protected documents, are typically used for copyright protection, <b>tamper</b> <b>proofing</b> and authentication generally require fragile or semi-fragile watermarks in order to detect modified or faked documents. Further, most of robust watermarking schemes are vulnerable to the so-called copy attack, where a watermark can be copied from one document to another by any unauthorized person, making these schemes inefficient in all authentication applications. In this paper, we propose a hybrid watermarking method joining a robust and a fragile or semi-fragile watermark, and [ [...] . ...|$|R
