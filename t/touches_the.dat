5|$|Central eclipse {{is often}} used as a generic term for a total, annular, or hybrid eclipse. This is, however, not {{completely}} correct: {{the definition of a}} central eclipse is an eclipse during which the central line of the umbra <b>touches</b> <b>the</b> Earth's surface. It is possible, though extremely rare, that part of the umbra intersects with the Earth (thus creating an annular or total eclipse), but not its central line. This is then called a non-central total or annular eclipse. The last (umbral yet) non-central solar eclipse was on April 29, 2014. This was an annular eclipse. The next non-central total solar eclipse will be on April 9, 2043.|$|E

A batsman can be given out for handling the ball if, while playing a delivery, the batsman intentionally <b>touches</b> <b>the</b> ball with {{one or both of}} their hands not holding the bat. A decision of not out must be reached if the batsman handles the ball to avoid incurring an injury. A bowler does not receive credit for the wicket when a batsman is dismissed in this fashion.|$|E

The supraoccipital, the backmost part of the skull, is convex. The sides of the concave palate are about parallel.|$|E

5|$|The force out: {{recorded}} {{against a}} runner who {{is required to}} attempt to advance—either because the runner is on first base and a batted ball lands in fair territory, or because the runner immediately behind on the basepath is thus required to attempt to advance—but fails to reach the next base before a fielder <b>touches</b> <b>the</b> base while holding the ball. The ground out is technically a special case of the force out.|$|E

If {{moved to a}} specific node, the character will stealthily take down guards, hack computers, and activate his human augmentations, such as invisibility. Enemies who spot Jensen will move towards and, if they reach his node, eliminate him. Alternatively, Jensen can eliminate enemies if approached from behind or their side. In the game's story, which is set before the events of , Jensen's sole mission is to save an important person, but is continually set back by puzzles—54 in total.|$|E
5|$|The two snails {{circle around}} each other {{for up to six}} hours, {{touching}} with their tentacles, and biting lips and the area of the genital pore, which shows some preliminary signs of the eversion of the penis. As the snails approach mating, hydraulic pressure builds up in the blood sinus surrounding the organ housing the dart. Each snail manoeuvres to get its genital pore in the best position, close to the other snail's body. Then, when the body of one snail <b>touches</b> <b>the</b> other snail's genital pore, it triggers the firing of the dart.|$|E

5|$|After {{a safety}} is scored, {{the ball is}} put into play by a free kick. The team that was scored upon must kick the ball from their own 20-yard line and can punt, drop kick, or place kick the ball. In {{professional}} play, a kicking tee cannot be used – however, a tee {{can be used in}} high school or college football. Once the ball has been kicked, it can be caught and advanced by any member of the receiving team, and it can be recovered by the kicking team if the ball travels at least 10 yards and bounces at least once or a player of the receiving team <b>touches</b> <b>the</b> ball.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Milhouse {{convince}} Comic Book Guy {{to publish}} a comic book he wrote titled Everyman, in which the title character can absorb superpowers from the characters of comic book he <b>touches.</b> <b>The</b> comic becomes an instant hit, and many Hollywood studios become interested in making it into a movie. Comic Book Guy agrees to let Everyman become a movie, but only if he can pick the star. When Comic Book Guy sees Homer, he considers Homer perfect for the role, as he wants Everyman to be played by a middle-aged fat man. But the studio executives realize that audiences want a physically fit actor for the role, so they hire celebrity fitness trainer Lyle McCarthy to get Homer into shape. After a month, Homer becomes fit and the movie begins production.|$|E

If another player on <b>the</b> goal-scoring team <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> puck to help score the goal before <b>the</b> goal-scoring player <b>touched</b> it without an opposing player intervening (<b>touching</b> <b>the</b> puck in between), then that player gets an assist.
