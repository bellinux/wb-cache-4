5|$|In the 1960s, the United States and Canada {{signed the}} Columbia River Treaty, {{which focused on}} flood control and the {{maximization}} of downstream power generation. Canada agreed to build dams and provide reservoir storage, and the United States agreed <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>to</b> Canada one-half {{of the increase in}} USdownstream power benefits as estimated five years in advance. Canada's obligation was met by building three dams (two on the Columbia, and one on the Duncan River), the last of which was completed in 1973.|$|E
5|$|The Missing Link {{takes place}} during the events of Human Revolution: after staging an {{explosion}} in the docks of Hengsha, Adam Jensen smuggles himself on board a ship bound for a secret research base inside a cryosleep pod. Adam is discovered and captured aboard the ship. Two Belltower commanders, Pieter Burke and Netanya Keitner, torture him for information on his identity. After the EMP chair holding him captive mysteriously deactivates, Adam is able to retrieve his equipment {{with the help of an}} unknown hacker who contacts him via radio. The ship docks at Rifleman Bank Station, a seaborne regional Belltower supply hub. After escaping into the station, Adam discovers that it was Keitner who set him free. Disillusioned with the unethical nature of local Belltower operations, she wants Adam to find concrete proof of illegal research that she can use <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>to</b> Interpol. She also instructs Adam to obtain weaponry from Garvin Quinn, resident technician and black market weapons trader.|$|E

5|$|The failure <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>to</b> Guadalcanal most of {{the troops}} and {{especially}} supplies in the convoy prevented the Japanese from launching another offensive to retake Henderson Field. Thereafter, the Imperial Navy was only able to deliver subsistence supplies and a few replacement troops to Japanese Army forces on Guadalcanal. Because of the continuing threat from Allied aircraft based at Henderson Field, plus nearby U.S. aircraft carriers, the Japanese had to continue to rely on Tokyo Express warship deliveries to their forces on Guadalcanal. However, these supplies and replacements were not enough to sustain Japanese troops on the island, who – by 7 December 1942 – were losing about 50 men each day from malnutrition, disease, and Allied ground and air attacks. On 12 December, the Japanese Navy proposed that Guadalcanal be abandoned. Despite opposition from Japanese Army leaders, who still hoped that Guadalcanal could be retaken from the Allies, Japan's Imperial General Headquarters—with approval from the Emperor—agreed on 31 December to the evacuation of all Japanese forces from the island and establishment of {{a new line of}} defense for the Solomons on New Georgia.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, 15 April, he flew {{his final}} sortie with 65 Squadron flying support for 266 Squadron and 402 Squadron. On {{the way back}} in the afternoon he claimed one Bf 109 destroyed. This, his fifth victory, made him an official fighter ace. However, according to other accounts, only two Bf 109s were involved in the brief air battle. Finucane's and 65's likely opponents in the battle was Adolf Galland, Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) Jagdgeschwader 26 and future General der Jagdflieger (General of Fighter Forces). Galland had taken off with his wingman and a crate containing lobster loaded into the fuselage of his Bf 109 <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>to</b> Jagdfliegerführer 2 Theo Osterkamp for his birthday at Luftflotte 2 headquarters. En route, Galland took a detour over the English coast and attacked several flights of Spitfires, claiming two 266 squadrons shot down. Galland's landing-gear fell down during the battle, possibly leading Finucane to claim it as destroyed. Both German pilots returned to France, their machines undamaged. Finucane was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) on 25 April.|$|E
5|$|Planning for Dragon Quest II {{began in}} April 1986, {{a month before}} the release of the {{original}} Dragon Quest. With the system and memory map decided, they started development in early July. At the beginning of development, producer Yukinobu Chida asked director and programmer Koichi Nakamura for a definite release date, and he offhandedly set one. Then the development team was divided into two groups, with one designing the story, as well as the monsters, and one doing the programming. The initial deadline was set for early November, but the game ultimately suffered a small delay. The development team had finished programming almost everything {{by the time of the}} initial release and believed the game could be released by the end of that year. In the Japanese magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump, published on November 11, 1986, it was announced that the game would be released in late December. However, the developers found that the game was too difficult, so it was delayed for month to adjust the balance. They had to finish the final version in mid-December, which they did, and then rushed <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>to</b> Nintendo to make the physical game cartridges. The game was released on January 26, 1987.|$|E

25|$|He did, however, {{appoint a}} nominal leader after himself. Shortly before the Báb's execution, a {{follower}} of the Báb, Abd al-Karim, brought to the Báb's attention the necessity to appoint a leader; thus the Báb wrote {{a certain number of}} tablets which he gave to Abd al-Karim <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>to</b> Subh-i-Azal and Bahá'u'lláh. These tablets were later interpreted by both Azalis and Bahá'ís as proof of the Báb's delegation of leadership. Bahá'í sources state that the Báb did this at the suggestion of Bahá'u'lláh.|$|E
25|$|According to this doctrine, God is not {{divided in}} the sense that each person has a third of the whole; rather, each person is {{considered}} to be fully God (see Perichoresis). The distinction lies in their relations, the Father being unbegotten; the Son being eternal yet begotten of the Father; and the Holy Spirit 'proceeding' from Father and (in Western theology) from the Son. Regardless of this apparent difference in their origins, the three 'persons' are each eternal and omnipotent. This is thought by Trinitarian Christians to be the revelation regarding God's nature which Jesus Christ came <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>to</b> the world, and is the foundation of their belief system.|$|E

25|$|According to Polybius, {{there had}} been several trade {{agreements}} between Rome and Carthage, even a mutual alliance against king Pyrrhus of Epirus. When Rome and Carthage made peace in 241 BC, Rome secured the release of all 8,000 prisoners of war without ransom and, furthermore, received {{a considerable amount of}} silver as a war indemnity. However, Carthage refused <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>to</b> Rome the Roman deserters serving among their troops. A first issue for dispute was that the initial treaty, agreed upon by Hamilcar Barca and the Roman commander in Sicily, had a clause stipulating that the Roman popular assembly had to accept the treaty in order for it to be valid. The assembly not only rejected the treaty but increased the indemnity Carthage had to pay.|$|E

The barriers to seeking antenatal care include travel time and distance from health care facilities, the high cost, and the inconvenient hours of operations of the clinics. Some women also did not want people to know they were pregnant until their third month of pregnancy, and would wait until then to seek antenatal care. Inexpensive care from traditional birth attendants included routine antenatal care, however untrained attendants and traditional healers did not provide antenatal care.|$|E

25|$|White sailed for England in late 1587, {{although}} {{crossing the}} Atlantic {{at that time}} of year was a considerable risk. Plans for a relief fleet were delayed first by the captain's refusal to return during the winter, and then the attack on England of the Spanish Armada and the subsequent Anglo-Spanish War. Every able English ship joined the fight, leaving White without a means to return to Roanoke at the time. In the spring of 1588, White managed to acquire two small vessels and sailed for Roanoke; however, his attempt to return was thwarted when the captains of the ships attempted to capture several Spanish ships on the outward-bound voyage (in order to improve their profits). They themselves were captured and their cargo seized. With nothing left <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>to</b> the colonists, the ships returned to England.|$|E
25|$|Bonario, {{a wealthy}} but mild-mannered {{merchant}} and former widower, is now married to Ciprigna. Much {{younger than her}} husband, Ciprigna is vain, capricious, and bullying. Bonario's children from his first marriage, Valerio and Isabella, and his servants, Fiuta the major domo and Cilia the maid, are so exasperated by her behaviour that they confront Bonario and threaten to leave his house unless he does something to curb his new wife's antics. Giglio, Ciprigna's fawning and flamboyant cavaliere servente, arrives and pays court to her. Their encounter in the garden is observed by Bonario, his children, and the servants. Bonario prepares a speech which he plans <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>to</b> Ciprigna {{in an attempt to}} reassert his authority but accidentally drops it. When she finds it, the outraged Ciprigna unbraids her husband in a lengthy tirade. Fiuta reproves his master for cowardice.|$|E
25|$|Rosencrantz and Guildenstern find {{themselves}} on a ship that has already set sail. The audience is {{led to believe that}} the pair has no knowledge of how they got there. At first, they try to determine whether they are still alive. Eventually, they recognize that they are not dead and are on board a boat. They remember that Claudius had given them a letter <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>to</b> England. After some brief confusion over who actually has the letter, they find it and end up opening it. They realize that Claudius has asked for Hamlet to be killed. While Rosencrantz seems hesitant to follow their orders now, Guildenstern convinces him that they are not worthy of interfering with fate and with the plans of kings. The stage becomes black and, presumably, the characters go to sleep. Hamlet switches the letter with one he has written himself, an act which takes place off stage in Hamlet.|$|E
