Nevertheless, the ACB changed its stance on players' writing, so that they could no longer comment on a tour until three months after its conclusion. The event is often perceived to have been a factor in O'Neill's eventual departure from the national scene.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{believed}} she had showed Spain that the French monarchy, {{far from being}} financially ruined and at war with its nobles, remained a glorious {{force to be reckoned}} with, capable of financing displays on a stunning scale, backed by a unified court. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> lost on the grim Duke of Alba, however. His letters reveal his frustration that Catherine’s spectacles kept interrupting the serious business of discussing how to make war on the Protestants. In the end, the Spanish decided the whole meeting been a waste of time, since Catherine had refused to change her policy towards the Huguenots in the slightest. The Huguenots, however, believed that their banishment from the talks between the two negotiating teams meant that Catherine had struck a secret deal with the Spanish to persecute them.|$|E

She added that Sony understands why the Church of England was offended especially because of its efforts to reduce the serious problem of gun violence in Manchester. She did not answer on whether Sony would donate money to the Cathedral's anti-gun program as the Church has demanded. At the time, over 2million copies of the game had been sold.|$|E
5|$|On 5 December 1908, Sunderland {{achieved}} {{their highest}} ever league win, against north-east rivals Newcastle United. They {{won the game}} 9–1; Billy Hogg and George Holley each scored hat-tricks. The club won the league again in 1913, but lost their first FA Cup final 1–0 to Aston Villa, in a very tough loss. This was the closest the club has come to winning the league title and the FA Cup in the same season. Two seasons later the First World War brought the league to a halt. After the league's resumption, Sunderland came close to winning another championship in the 1922–23 season, when they were runners-up to Liverpool. They also came close the following season, finishing third, four points {{from the top of}} the league. The club escaped relegation from the First Division by one point in the 1927–28 season despite 35 goals from Dave Halliday. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> won in a match against Middlesbrough, and they finished in fifteenth place. Halliday improved his goal scoring to 43 goals in 42 games the following season, an all-time Sunderland record for goals scored in a single season.|$|E

50|$|One {{simple way}} of finding whether <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> {{inside or outside}} a simple polygon is to test how many times a ray, {{starting}} from <b>the</b> <b>point</b> and going in any fixed direction, intersects {{the edges of the}} polygon. If <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> on <b>the</b> outside of the polygon the ray will intersect its edge an even number of times. If <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> on <b>the</b> inside of the polygon then it will intersect the edge an odd number of times. Unfortunately, this method won't work if <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> on <b>the</b> edge of the polygon.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Point</b> <b>was</b> {{formed by}} {{longshore}} drift and this movement continues westward; the spit lengthened by 132.1m (433ft) between 1886 and 1925. At the western end, the shingle curves south towards the mainland. This feature has developed {{several times over}} the years, giving the impression from {{the air of a}} series of hooks along {{the south side of the}} spit. Salt marshes have formed between the shingle curves and in front of the coasts sheltered by the spit, and sand dunes have accumulated at the Point's western end. Some of the shorter side ridges meet the main ridge at a steep angle due to the southward movement of the latter. There is an area of reclaimed farmland, known as Blakeney Freshes, to the west of Cley Beach Road.|$|E
5|$|During the 2007 Stanley Cup playoffs, Hansen {{was called}} {{up by the}} Canucks. He became the first born-and-raised Danish player to compete and {{register}} {{a point in the}} NHL post-season — Frans Nielsen had played and scored the first point by a born-and-raised Dane in the regular season earlier that year. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> scored in Game 3 of the first round against the Dallas Stars by assisting on a goal by Jan Bulis. The Canucks advanced past the Stars in seven games to meet the Anaheim Ducks in the second round. In Game 5 of the series, with the Canucks facing elimination in overtime, Hansen played an instrumental part on the ice when the Ducks scored. Attempting to carry the puck out of the defensive zone, he was hit to the ice by Ducks forward Rob Niedermayer. While Canucks goaltender Roberto Luongo had his arm up {{in the direction of the}} referee, protesting the lack of penalty, the puck came loose to Ducks defenceman Scott Niedermayer, who scored past the distracted Luongo. Following the Canucks' elimination, Hansen was sent back to the Moose for their 2007 Calder Cup playoffs. Back in the AHL, he was pointless in six games as the Moose were defeated by the Hamilton Bulldogs in the second round.|$|E
5|$|James VI's {{visit to}} Denmark in 1589, where witch-hunts were already common, may have {{encouraged}} {{an interest in}} the study of witchcraft, and he came to see the storms he encountered on his voyage as the result of magic. After his return to Scotland, he attended the North Berwick witch trials, the first major persecution of witches in Scotland under the 1563 Act and the first known to successfully involve the diabolic pact. Several people, most notably Agnes Sampson and the schoolmaster John Fian, were convicted of using witchcraft to send storms against James' ship. James became obsessed with the threat posed by witches. He subsequently believed that a nobleman, Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell, was a witch, and after the latter fled in fear of his life, he was outlawed as a traitor. The king subsequently set up royal commissions to hunt down witches in his realm, recommending torture in dealing with suspects. James is known to have personally supervised the torture of women accused of being witches. Inspired by his personal involvement, in 1597 he wrote the Daemonologie, a tract that opposed the practice of witchcraft and which provided background material for Shakespeare's Tragedy of Macbeth, which contains probably the most famous literary depiction of Scottish witches. James imported continental explanations of witchcraft. His goal was to divert suspicion away from male homosociality among the elite, and focus fear on female communities and large gatherings of women. He thought they threatened his political power so he laid the foundation for witchcraft and occultism policies, especially in Scotland. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> that a widespread belief in the conspiracy of witches and a witches' Sabbath with the devil deprived women of political influence. Occult power was supposedly a womanly trait because women were weaker and more susceptible to the devil. However, after the publication of Daemonologie his views became more sceptical, and in the same year he revoked the standing commissions on witchcraft, limiting prosecutions by the central courts.|$|E

25|$|The women's {{contribution}} {{to the war effort}} challenged the notion of women's physical and mental inferiority and made it more difficult to maintain that women were, both by constitution and temperament, unfit to vote. If women could work in munitions factories, it seemed both ungrateful and illogical to deny them a place in the polling booth. But the vote was much more than simply a reward for war work; <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> that women's participation in the war helped to dispel the fears that surrounded women's entry into the public arena.|$|E
25|$|To {{the east}} of the city lies Flagstaff Point, a rocky {{headland}} with eroded low cliffs topped by a grassy hill. The northern side of <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> excavated by convict labour to form Belmore Basin. This was later extended with the northern breakwater to create Wollongong Harbour. The area is the site of a historic colonial fort, several restored cannons and two lighthouses, a feature peculiar to the east coast of Australia. The older Wollongong Breakwater Lighthouse located at the harbour entrance was made of wrought iron plates in 1871 and has become an icon of the city. The newer Wollongong Head Lighthouse was constructed in 1936 atop the Flagstaff Hill and is still used in the early 21st century. Belmore Basin houses the commercial fishing fleet and Fisherman's Co-op, while the main harbour shelters private vessels.|$|E

25|$|For 1984, Brunner's new D7 chassis was introduced, but it {{was largely}} the same story, with not inconsiderable speed rarely rewarded, not helped by Brunner quitting after, predictably, yet another an {{argument}} with Schmid. Winkelhock ran 3rd at the Belgian Grand Prix before the electrical system failed, but his best finishes were 8th places in the Canadian Grand Prix and the Dallas Grand Prix. From the Austrian Grand Prix, a second D7 was added for Gerhard Berger. After a gearbox failure on the grid at the Italian Grand Prix, Winkelhock finally lost patience and quit.

25|$|In reality, for MACSOG, <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> moot. Suspicions abounded {{within the}} {{organization}} that Operation Timberwork had been penetrated by communist dich van agents. The intelligence returns from the northern agent teams had been strangely lax and {{more than three-quarters of}} the agents inserted had been captured either during or not long after their arrival. The fact that SOG had slavishly followed the CIA's failed formula for three years was not considered a contributing factor. The unit was more concerned over Washington's continuous rejection of one of the original goals of the operation, the formation of a resistance movement by possible dissident elements within North Vietnam. Washington's stated goal in the conflict was a free and viable South Vietnam, not the overthrow of the Hanoi regime. The conundrum was {{what would happen if the}} program had succeeded. The best possible outcome would have been a repeat of the ill-fated Hungarian uprising of 1956, brutally crushed by the Soviet Union, and about which the U.S. could do nothing.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{theories}} about migration into the Americas have centered on migration from Beringia through {{the interior of}} North America. The discovery of artifacts in association with Pleistocene faunal remains near Clovis, New Mexico in the early 1930s required extension of the timeframe for the settlement of North America to the period during which glaciers were still extensive. That led to the hypothesis of a migration route between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets to explain the early settlement. The Clovis site was host to a lithic technology characterized by spear points with an indentation, or flute, where <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> attached to the shaft. A lithic complex characterized by the Clovis Point technology was subsequently identified over much of North America and in South America. The association of Clovis complex technology with late Pleistocene faunal remains led to the theory that it marked the arrival of big game hunters that migrated out of Beringia then dispersed throughout the Americas, otherwise known as the Clovis First theory.|$|E
