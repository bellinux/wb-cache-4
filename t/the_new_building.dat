5|$|Further {{disagreements}} existed {{about the}} design and character of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>building.</b> Facsimile reconstruction, while feasible, was not seriously contemplated. There was a general agreement that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>building</b> should also have a cultural as well as commercial purpose. While the Jewish Community of Zagreb envisioned a modern design reminiscent of the original synagogue, the Bet Israel advocated building {{a replica of the}} original synagogue's facade, perceiving it as having a powerful symbolism. Opinions of architects, urban planners, and art historians were also divided along similar lines.|$|E
5|$|In May 1960, {{the then}} Oregon State College was {{advanced}} $19,000 {{by the federal}} government to plan for a new $2,170,000 building. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>building</b> was designed by architects Hamlin & Martin, and the cost rose to $2.4 million by the time the school accepted bids on the project in April 1962. Ground was broken on the project on May 1, 1962, with Shields Construction Company as the general contractor for the project. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>building</b> would double the size of Oregon State's library.|$|E
5|$|Oregon Agricultural College {{opened a}} new library in 1918, marking {{the first time that}} the library had its own building. Prior to 1918 the library had been housed on the second floor of the college's {{administration}} building, Benton Hall. When <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>building</b> was completed, the school built a temporary trellis from neighboring Benton Hall's second floor to the second floor of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>building</b> in order to more easily transfer the books to their new location. Initially, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>building</b> also housed offices and classrooms, but within a decade the library expanded to occupy all of the structure. John V. Bennes designed <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>building,</b> as well as many of the campus buildings constructed during that period. By 1922 the collection had grown to 73,000 volumes, and Lucy M. Lewis served as the school's librarian.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, French {{officials}} {{decided to}} build a satellite museum {{on the site of}} an abandoned coal pit in the former mining town of Lens to relieve the crowded Paris Louvre, increase total museum visits, and improve the industrial north's economy. Six cities were considered for the project: Amiens, Arras, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Calais, Lens, and Valenciennes. In 2004, French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin chose Lens to be the site of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>building,</b> the Louvre-Lens. Japanese architects SANAA were selected to design the Lens project in 2005. Museum officials predicted that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>building,</b> capable of receiving about 600works of art, would attract up to 500,000visitors a year when it opened in 2012.|$|E

5|$|Since the 1980s, {{plans have}} been made to rebuild the synagogue in its {{original}} location. Due to various political circumstances, very limited progress has been made.

50|$|Apart from {{imported}} slate, {{a striking}} characteristic {{of all of}} <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>buildings</b> of <b>the</b> early 19th century is the continued use of local vernacular materials, albeit in buildings of non-vernacular design. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>buildings</b> were constructed alongside older wholly vernacular survivals and, sometimes superficially updated with fashionable applied facades, fenestration or upper floors and roofs.|$|R
5|$|While {{construction}} was underway the original terminus remained in use, although the LSWR was granted running rights through the station. On 23 February Major J. W. Pringle of the Board of Trade inspected <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>building</b> and expressed {{concerns over the}} safety of the arrangements for trains entering the station from the main line, which entailed crossing the LSWR's multiple tracks. He was also unhappy about the newly installed passenger lifts and the unfinished nature of the passenger terminus, but nonetheless approved the limited use of the new station for funeral trains. Soon after the transfer of LNC services to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>building</b> the LSWR viaduct was widened to serve a greatly enlarged Waterloo station, destroying all traces of the original LNC terminus.|$|E
5|$|With Indiana's rapid {{increase}} of population {{during the middle}} of the 19th century, the state's government increased in size, causing the previous capitol building to become crowded. In 1865, a state office building had to be constructed to house some of the burgeoning government, and the Supreme Court and several bureaus were relocated into <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>building.</b> When the statehouse was condemned in 1877, the state was without a real capitol building, and the administration of Governor James D. Williams proposed the construction of the current state capitol building. The plan was approved by the Indiana General Assembly during the legislative session of 1878. After the third state capitol building had been razed, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>building</b> was constructed on the same site. Two million dollars (USD) were appropriated for construction of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>building,</b> and it was completed in 1888. Governor Williams, who was famed for his frugality, was able to complete the project for $1.8 million and returned the extra $200,000 to the general fund.|$|E
5|$|As 30% of the {{upgrading}} cost {{had to be}} paid by {{the community}} club, several fundraising activities were carried out for the redevelopment.
