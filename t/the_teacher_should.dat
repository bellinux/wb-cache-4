2500|$|For Dewey and his {{philosophical}} followers, education stifles individual autonomy when learners {{are taught}} {{that knowledge is}} transmitted in one direction, from the expert to the learner. [...] Dewey not only re-imagined {{the way that the}} learning process should take place, but also the role that <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>should</b> play within that process. [...] For Dewey, “The thing needful is improvement of education, not simply by turning out teachers who can do better the things that are not necessary to do, but rather by changing the conception of what constitutes education” (Dewey, 1904, p.18). [...] Dewey’s qualifications for teaching—a natural love for working with young children, a natural propensity to inquire about the subjects, methods and other social issues related to the profession, and a desire to share this acquired knowledge with others—are not a set of outwardly displayed mechanical skills. [...] Rather, they may be viewed as internalized principles or habits which “work automatically, unconsciously” (Dewey, 1904, p.15). [...] Turning to Dewey's essays and public addresses regarding the teaching profession, followed by his analysis of the teacher as a person and a professional, as well as his beliefs regarding the responsibilities of teacher education programs to cultivate the attributes addressed, teacher educators can begin to reimagine the successful classroom teacher Dewey envisioned.|$|E

2500|$|Dewey {{not only}} re-imagined {{the way that}} the {{learning}} process should take place, but also the role that <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>should</b> play within that process. [...] Throughout the history of American schooling, education’s purpose has been to train students for work by providing the student with a limited set of skills and information to do a particular job. [...] The works of John Dewey provide the most prolific examples of how this limited vocational view of education has been applied to both the K–12 public education system and to the teacher training schools who attempted to quickly produce proficient and practical teachers with a limited set of instructional and discipline-specific skills needed {{to meet the needs of}} the employer and demands of the workforce. [...] In The School and Society (Dewey, 1976) and Democracy of Education (Dewey, 1980), Dewey claims that rather than preparing citizens for ethical participation in society, schools cultivate passive pupils via insistence upon mastery of facts and disciplining of bodies. [...] Rather than preparing students to be reflective, autonomous and ethical beings capable of arriving at social truths through critical and intersubjective discourse, schools prepare students for docile compliance with authoritarian work and political structures, discourage the pursuit of individual and communal inquiry, and perceive higher learning as a monopoly of the institution of education (Dewey, 1976; 1980).|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{exploring}} and describing the factors discouraging students from schooling at a secondary school in Laos, including the classroom and school context, the individual student context, the family context, and the community context. Descriptive qualitative approach was used, and {{the framework of the}} research study was formulated around the aspects of school and classroom climate, principal’s management process, teachers’ teaching organization and performance, parents’ involvement and perception, and community’s involvement and perception. The data were collected through observation, document analysis, and interview from 10 students, six teachers, one principal, one vice principal at Phonsyneua Junior Secondary School, and seven parents whose children were studying at this school. The finding shows that among the factors involved in the student schooling at secondary school, several factors have been discouraging the students from schooling. <b>The</b> <b>teacher’s</b> performances were not perfect yet. Some students’ competency was not qualified enough. The students’ parents were not highly committed and involved in their children schooling. The community had little trust in schooling since they perceived that schooling costs lots of money. To improve these discouraging factors, several actions should be taken into consideration. The principal <b>should</b> ask all <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> to communicate <b>the</b> vision and missions to the students, or the vision and mission should be published in the school campus. The observations on teachers’ teaching should be done by both the principal and <b>the</b> senior <b>teachers.</b> <b>The</b> yearly evaluations of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>should</b> be done more authentically and more transparently. The monthly technical meetings should be conducted on Mondays. More information should be communicated to the students.

On the first day of <b>the</b> teaching, <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>should</b> introduce <b>the</b> school vision and missions to the students, provide the students with syllabus, and set up the rules and procedures for the teaching and learning process. All <b>teachers</b> <b>should</b> be either well-prepared or punctual for their teachings and come to teach the students regularly. The students with low competency should be given attention.
