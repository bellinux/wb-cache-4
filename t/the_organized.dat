2500|$|Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon {{assert that}} <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> model has several key {{advantages}} that {{distinguish it from}} the servicing model, such {{as the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> model promotes [...] "systematic," [...] proactive, and well-thought out campaigns, which help the union's goals get satisfactorily and pragmatically achieved. More broadly, one of the obvious advantages of <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> model is that it allows workers to actually be involved in the campaigns that most closely affect them, promoting both equity and equality. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> model, as opposed to the servicing model, provides for the union's future by broadening its support from the workers and giving them a sense of investment into the day-to-day functions of the union itself. Bob Carter and Rae Cooper, in their research about British trade unions and their use of <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> model, state that, within the unions themselves, there was praise for <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> model because it upheld the [...] "...core role of trade unions".

2500|$|The {{response}} to this union crisis in Australia is the Organising Works program which was established in 1994 to recruit organizers from union members and university students. <b>The</b> <b>Organizing</b> Works Program, in Australia, was established after representatives from Australian unions visited the U.S. and observed <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> model in practice. Organising Works is a relatively unique program in Australia, in that it combines explicit training in trade unionism with an apprenticeship system with specific trade unions. Bob Carter and Rae Cooper state that Organizing Works was successful in spreading {{the message of the}} model and recruiting new members for unions, and in general, Australian unions were more committed to <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> model than were British unions. David Peetz and Barbara Pocock state that in the first six years of <b>the</b> <b>Organizing</b> Works Program in Australia, [...] "...it had produced over 300 trainees..."

2500|$|Jack Fiorito {{states that}} <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> model and <b>the</b> {{servicing}} model cannot be considered separate and {{there needs to}} be provision for using both models at the same time; Fiorito's research about British union members showed that [...] "...a large number of responses express reservations about the OM or at least <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> vs. servicing dichotomy suggested. Many of these responses emphasize the importance of service as an aid to organizing (18%) or something that is expected by the members (23%)." [...] Fiorito believes that <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> model and <b>the</b> servicing model are not mutually exclusive in some cases; there are some instances when the two models could be complementary. The debate over <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> model versus <b>the</b> servicing model is widespread and multifaceted.

5|$|Set on {{the prosperous}} Long Island of 1922, The Great Gatsby {{provides}} a critical {{social history of}} America during the Roaring Twenties within its fictional narrative.

2500|$|Fletcher and Hurd {{state that}} unions may also face issues of {{resistance}} by pre-existing [...] "staff," [...] {{who may be}} hesitant or even suspicious at the adoption of <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> model. Dealing with resistant staff {{would be a major}} disadvantage of using <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> model, as opposed to the servicing model, to which the staff are both accustomed and familiar with. Fletcher and Hurd assert that, {{based on the fact that}} unions employing <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> model have to reassign tasks and take time to train people, [...] "...following <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> model creates more work than sticking to the servicing model." [...] Richard Hurd argues that <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> model can, at times, create [...] "...continual warfare..." [...] between the workers and the employer, which is a disadvantage because there is a trend of workers [...] "...preferring stability rather than on-going class struggle." [...] If this is really the mindset of the workers, then it would be hard to actually maintain <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> model for long periods of time. Fred Glass says that [...] "...an organizing model of unionism requires an organizing model of labor communications" [...] because <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> model requires an effective way to share information with workers quickly and efficiently. Bob Carter, in regard to <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> model [...] in British unions, is concerned with the method of implementation and whether or not workers consent to switching from servicing to organizing. Carter says that [...] "A model which is premised on debate and involvement cannot be successfully introduced without discussion..." [...] Carter worries about whether or not workers are a part of the transition process and whether they consent to all of the implications that come with <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> model.|$|R

5|$|The Second Army was {{commanded}} by General Charles Huntziger, {{who was responsible}} for the defense of the Ardennes region of the frontier, including the Fortified Sector of Montmédy. The sector was composed of two parts. The eastern portion was defended by the Maginot positions of La Ferté, Chesnois, Thonnelle and Vélosnes, widely spaced and small, compared to the massive fortifications of other sectors like Thionville. The western portion of the Montmédy sector was even more lightly defended, with several lines of fortifications ranging from fortified houses near the border to small blockhouses farther back. None of the western defenses were of a scale sufficient to support La Ferté or to act as a significant block to an invading force without <b>the</b> <b>organized</b> support of mobile army formations. The relatively weak La Ferté position effectively acted as the western end of fixed fortifications.|$|E
5|$|The first divine act is the {{creation}} of the cosmos, described in several creation myths. They focus on different gods, each of which may act as creator deities. The eight gods of the Ogdoad, who represent the chaos that precedes creation, give birth to the sun god, who establishes order in the newly formed world; Ptah, who embodies thought and creativity, gives form to all things by envisioning and naming them; Atum produces all things as emanations of himself; and Amun, according to the theology promoted by his priesthood, preceded and created the other creator gods. These and other versions of the events of creation were not seen as contradictory. Each gives a different perspective on the complex process by which <b>the</b> <b>organized</b> universe and its many deities emerged from undifferentiated chaos. The period following creation, in which a series of gods rule as kings over the divine society, is the setting for most myths. The gods struggle against the forces of chaos and among each other before withdrawing from the human world and installing the historical kings of Egypt to rule in their place.|$|E

2500|$|According to Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon, British {{unions are}} more likely to focus on the ideological basis for <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> model, rather than the {{practical}} applications of it. Jack Fiorito states that the U.K.'s adaptation of <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> model has some very specific characteristics {{that may or may not}} be seen in other countries.

When Fiorito interviewed U.K. union members during this timeframe, [...] "Almost half of respondents (45%) volunteer that their union is adopting the OM," [...] which is Fiorito's abbreviation for <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> model. <b>The</b> <b>organizing</b> model was present in many British unions in the 2000s, and the workers were aware of its presence. The British union members largely felt that <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> model was a good model to have implemented in their unions, and they were satisfied with its results. Fiorito states that [...] "Although the OM varies somewhat in meaning, a strong majority of unionists feel that their union is truly committed to recruiting and organizing new members...".|$|R
