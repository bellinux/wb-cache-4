50|$|The Chapman strut {{is often}} {{confused}} with the MacPherson strut, as both use a near-vertical upper strut, The distinction is that the MacPherson strut always requires a lower <b>track</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> where the Chapman uses the drive shaft and a light radius rod.|$|E
5000|$|As the {{anti-roll}} bar {{is required to}} control wheel position, the bars of a MacPherson strut suspension may be connected through ball joints. However many later [...] "MacPherson strut" [...] suspensions have reverted to using wishbones rather than the simplified <b>track</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> of the original design.|$|E
50|$|<b>Control</b> <b>arms</b> {{are most}} {{commonly}} encountered {{as part of}} the MacPherson strut independent front suspension. The <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> are perpendicular to the axis of the vehicle and are termed <b>track</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms.</b> A diagonal radius rod constrains the strut from moving forward and back.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} system utilised fully independent front suspension, with MacPherson struts, <b>track</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> and anti-roll bar. The rear suspension was quite advanced (when using a solid live rear axle), {{in that the}} rear axle was controlled by double unequal length trailing arms and a panhard rod, with coil springs and direct acting dampers. This design proved far superior to many of its contemporaries, especially with vehicle stability and handling.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after the}} launch of the Mk2F, another {{sporting}} model was added to the range â€” {{a new version of the}} supercharged G40, now as a full production model in all markets, rather than the limited batch of Mk2 G40s. Engine and gearbox aside, mechanical differences between the G40 and similar looking GT included 20 mm lower suspension, 239 mm vented front brake discs and rose-jointed steering and <b>track</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms.</b> The G40 was also marked out by its Le Mans check interior trim, roof-mounted 'bee-sting' aerial and BBS 5.5Jx13 cross-spoke alloy wheels, while the speedometer topped out at 160 mph (compared to 120 mph on the GT).|$|R
50|$|The MacPherson strut is {{a common}} form of strut suspension. This {{was not the first}} attempt at strut suspension, but in MacPherson's {{original}} patent, the anti-roll bar forms an integral and essential part of the suspension, in addition to its usual function in controlling body roll. A strut suspension like MacPherson's requires a hinged lower member between the chassis and wheel hub to control the wheel position both inwards and outwards (controlling the track), and also forwards and backwards. This may be provided by a wishbone with a number of joints, or by using an additional radius rod. MacPherson's design replaced the wishbone with a simpler and cheaper <b>track</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> with a single inboard joint, to control the track. Forward and backward position was controlled through the anti-roll bar. Overall this required a simpler and cheaper set of suspension members than with wishbones, also allowing a reduction in unsprung weight.|$|E
50|$|MacPherson's strut took {{advantage}} of the unitary car bodies appearing in new factories after World War II: the strut requires a high top mounting point, which would be difficult to arrange for a ladder chassis, but is also advantageous for unitary construction as it distributes suspension loads over a greater volume of the bodyshell. New car designs were also lighter and faster than pre-war cars, a cheap mass-production car now having performance that would previously have been the preserve of an expensive sports car. Drivers demanded roadholding and comfort that required independent front suspension. MacPherson's strut was cheap to manufacture and reliable in service, having few moving joints and using the new telescopic shock absorbers, rather than the previous lever arms. MacPherson's strut also integrated an anti-roll bar, not only for control of body roll but also re-using it {{as an integral part of}} the suspension and so avoiding the need for a wishbone or radius rod in favour of a simple <b>track</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In the RS4 suspension, a fluid {{hydraulic}} {{linkage between}} diagonally opposing {{front and rear}} suspension dampers (left front to right rear, and vice versa) is used to counteract vehicle pitch and roll. [...] Lightweight magnesium/aluminium alloy multi-link suspension arms (four arm with virtual steering axis up front, and trapezoidal arm with unequal length <b>track</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> at the rear) locate each hub/brake/roadwheel assembly in a controllable fashion, whilst minimising unsprung masses. [...] Lightweight hollow tubular anti-roll bars are standard front and rear. [...] Compared to standard B7 A4 models, the RS4 features a [...] lower ride height.

It {{includes}} [...] wider rear body, [...] lower front spoiler lip, [...] rear wing (from 911 GT3 Cup S race car), LED taillights, racing exhaust {{system with a}} fully controlled catalytic converter, a modified special exhaust system offering more dynamic and muscular sound (from Porsche Mobil1 Supercup cars), Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes. 9.5Jx18 front alloy wheels with 24/64-18 Michelin racing tyres and 12Jx18 alloy wheels with 27/68-18 tyres, additional Unibal joints on the <b>track</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> and front and rear sword-shaped anti-roll bars with seven position settings each, additional vent in {{the upper part of}} the front lid, steering wheel mounted Info Display with 6 switches, Carrara White body. The vehicle was unveiled in 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show.|$|R
5000|$|The B7 RS4 also {{incorporates}} Audi's [...] "Dynamic Ride Control" [...] (DRC) [...] "Sports Suspension" [...] mechanism. The dampers (shock absorbers) {{are made}} for Audi by KW, and central reservoirs/valves made by KYB (Kayaba).In the RS4 suspension, a fluid hydraulic linkage between diagonally opposing front and rear suspension dampers (left front to right rear, and vice versa) is used to counteract vehicle pitch and roll.

50|$|The {{suspension}} {{changes to}} the car were quite extensive; the car received shorter struts up front, forged <b>track</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> and 5.5J by 13 steel wheel rims. The rear was even more radical with vertical coil spring/dampers replacing the leaf springs and two trailing arms with a A- bracket (which connected to the differential housing and brackets near the trailing arm pivots) sorting out axle location. To support this set-up, further braces were put behind the rear seat and from the rear wheelarch down to chassis in the boot. The stiffening braces meant that the spare wheel had to be moved from the standard Cortina's wheel well and was bolted {{to the left side}} of the boot floor. The battery was also relocated to the boot, behind the right wheelarch. Both of these changes made big improvements to overall weight distribution. Another improvement the Cortina Lotus gained was the new braking system (9.5 in front discs) which were built by brake specialist Girling. This system also was fitted to Cortina GTs but without a servo, which was fitted in the Cortina Lotus engine bay.|$|R
50|$|In mid-1985, a two-wheel-drive {{version of}} the Cherokee {{was added to the}} lineup. This marked the first time any Jeep product was offered with two-wheel drive since 1967, and was done in the hopes of {{attracting}} a few more buyers who did not need (or want to pay for) four-wheel drive. When the XJ Cherokee-based Comanche (MJ) truck was introduced, it was also available in two- and four-wheel drive. The new two-wheel-drive models shared the front suspension (from the <b>track</b> bar, <b>control</b> <b>arms,</b> ball joints) with four-wheel-drive models. Jeep simply used a single axle tube from hub to hub with no differential between, resulting in an inexpensive front suspension.|$|R

In this work it is mainly concentrated on stiffness, slippage and damage of upper <b>control</b> <b>arm.</b> The upper <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> is subjected to different type of loads such as static loads and cyclic loads. Stiffness is improved by changing shape and size of upper <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> this is achieved by static analysis. This analysis is carried out to find displacement, stress and stiffness.

40|$|Abstract. Reverse {{modeling}} of vehicle suspension <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> is studied. Firstly, {{the data of}} vehicle suspension <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> is acquired. Secondly, the scanning point cloud data is processed. Then 3 D model of vehicle suspension <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> is reconstructed. Finally, modelâ€™s deviation is analyzed {{to find out the}} deficiencies and to improve the accuracy of the model. Reverse modeling based on CATIA can make up the shortage of traditional modeling method and solve the problem of gaining the data of complex curved surface parts. It also can shorten the innovation and improvement cycle of the vehicle suspension <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> and reduce the production cost and enhance enterprise competitiveness...|$|R

30|$|Guideline-based {{medication}} regimens {{which included}} statin therapy were reportedly used at baseline, during the trial, or throughout follow-up, in 24 (34 %) of the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> comparisons. In a further seven comparisons (10 %), statin therapy was not explicitly reported but probable given {{the dates of}} participant recruitment. Lipid-lowering therapy was either not begun in the <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> or reported as not used, in 17 comparisons (24 %) and was unlikely used in a further 24 comparisons with recruitment and follow-up periods preceding 1994. Overall, this resulted in statin use in the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> (matched with comparable use in the intervention arm) for 40 % of comparisons, 56 % of comparisons without statin use in either arm and three trials [46, 48, 60] in which the intervention arm included a specific pharmacological lipid-lowering strategy compared to the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> (TableÂ  1).|$|R

5000|$|The front {{suspension}} {{consists of}} {{upper and lower}} <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> with coilover shocks. A common misconception with this platform is that the front end has struts; however, since there is an upper <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> they are actually coilover shocks. Brakes were a vented rotor / single-piston caliper with Sport model Thunderbirds receiving a larger diameter rotor. The rear suspension consisted of upper and lower <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> with coil spring and shock. Varying sway bar diameters were used among the different models of Cougar and Thunderbird. All MN12 cars shipped from the factory with a 5 x 4.25" [...] (5x108mm) lugnut bolt pattern.|$|R
2500|$|Also new, the {{double-wishbone}} front suspension had ball joints, {{upper and}} lower <b>control</b> <b>arms,</b> coil springs and shock absorbers above the upper control arms; as well as trailing struts on the lower <b>control</b> <b>arms.</b> The [...] "Magnum 500" [...] road wheels were now standard, but the new [...] "Machine" [...] 15x7inch slot-styled wheels were optional.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study {{proposes a}} {{structural}} design method {{for the upper}} <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> installed at the rear side of a SUV. The weight of <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> can be reduced by applying the design and material technologies. In this research, the former includes optimization technology, and the latter the technologies for selecting aluminum as a steel-substitute material. Strength assessment {{is the most important}} design criterion in the structural design of a <b>control</b> <b>arm.</b> At the proto design stage of a new <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> FE (finite element) analysis is often utilized to predict its strength. This study considers the static strength in the optimization process. The inertia relief method for FE analysis is utilized to simulate the static loading conditions. According to the classification of structural optimization, the structural design of a <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> is included in the category of shape optimization. In this study, the kriging interpolation method is adopted to obtain the minimum weight satisfying the strength constraint. Optimum designs are obtained by ANSYS WORKBENCH and the in-house program, EXCEL-kriging program. The optimum results determined from the in-house program are compared with those of ANSYS WORKBENCH...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> of {{a surface}} vessel {{with only two}} control inputs.
