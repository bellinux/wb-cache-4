2500|$|The concept [...] "anti-American" [...] is an {{interesting}} one. The counterpart is used only in totalitarian states or military dictatorships... Thus, in <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union,</b> dissidents were condemned as [...] "anti-Soviet". That's a natural usage among people with deeply rooted totalitarian instincts, which identify state policy with the society, the people, the culture. In contrast, people with even the slightest concept of democracy treat such notions with ridicule and contempt.|$|E
2500|$|Hitchens {{opposed the}} Kosovo and 2003 Iraq War, {{on the grounds}} that neither was in the {{interests}} of either Britain or the United States, and opposes the British military presence in Afghanistan, arguing that it has no achievable aim. He believes in upholding the principle of Westphalian sovereignty, which he described as that [...] "you didn’t interfere in foreign countries because you didn’t like the way they were governed". He urges better relations between the West and Russia, viewing conflict as unnecessary, and, while condemning <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> as an [...] "evil empire" [...] and Vladimir Putin as corrupt, he states his [...] "strong affection for post-communist Russia."

2500|$|The [...] "short twentieth century", from 1914 to 1991, {{included}} the First World War, the Second World War and the Cold War. The First World War used modern technology to kill millions of soldiers. Victory by Britain, France, the United States and other allies drastically changed {{the map of}} Europe, ending four major land empires (the Russian, German, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires) and leading {{to the creation of}} nation-states across Central and Eastern Europe. The October Revolution in Russia {{led to the creation of}} the Soviet Union (1917–1991) and the rise of the international communist movement. Widespread economic prosperity was typical of the period before 1914, and 1920–1929. After the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, however, democracy collapsed in most of Europe. Fascists took control in Italy, and the even more aggressive Nazi movement led by Adolf Hitler took control of Germany, 1933–45. The Second World War was fought on an even larger scale than the First war, killing many more people, and using even more advanced technology. It ended with the division of Europe between East and West, with the East under the control of the Soviet Union and the West dominated by NATO. The two sides engaged in the Cold War, with actual conflict taking place not in Europe but in Asia in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The Imperial system collapsed. The remaining colonial empires ended through the decolonisation of European rule in Africa and Asia. The fall of Soviet Communism (1989– 1991) left the West dominant and enabled the reunification of Germany. It accelerated the process of a European integration to include Eastern Europe. The European Union continues today, but with German economic dominance. Since the worldwide Great Recession of 2008, European growth has been slow, and financial crises have hit Greece and other countries. Social divisiveness has been caused by large-scale immigration and radical Islamic rejection of European norms. [...] While Russia is a weak version of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union,</b> it has been confronting Europe in Ukraine and other areas.|$|E
50|$|In December 1988, the 1977 Soviet Constitution was {{amended to}} create a new {{legislative}} body, the Congress of People's Deputies (CPD), to replace <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Supreme <b>Soviet</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union.</b> The Congress of People's Deputies consisted of 2,250 deputies. 750 deputies (one third) were reserved for the CPSU and its affiliated organizations, however, the remaining two-thirds would be elected under the principles of demokratizatsiya, with 750 under the system of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> (one deputy per 300,000 citizens) and 750 under the system of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> of Nationalities (an equal number of deputies for each of the fifteen Union Republics).

25|$|The {{analysis}} of the succession of states {{with respect to the}} 15 post-Soviet states is complex.

5000|$|Zhydovka (жидовка, жидівка, żydówka, židovka) is a {{term used}} for a Jewish woman. The term is {{used to refer to}} women who are of Jewish heritage.

(In fact, the two Jewish resistance organizations in the Warsaw ghetto called themselves Żydowska Organizacja Bojowa and Żydowski Związek Wojskowy in Polish.) The word zhyd was banned illegal to use by the Soviet authorities in the 1930s, also in the languages of the Soviet Union in which it had no negative connotations.|$|E
