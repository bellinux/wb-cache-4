25|$|Presumptions whereupon persons may be committed, and, much more, {{convictions}} whereupon persons may {{be condemned}} as guilty of witchcrafts, ought certainly {{to be more}} considerable than barely the accused person's being represented by a specter unto the afflicted; inasmuch as it is an undoubted and notorious <b>thing,</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> demon may, by God's permission, appear, even to ill purposes, {{in the shape of}} an innocent, yea, and a virtuous man. Nor can we esteem alterations made in the sufferers, by a look or touch of the accused, to be an infallible evidence of guilt, but frequently liable to be abused by the Devil's legerdemains.|$|E
25|$|It {{is a fine}} <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> man astride two wheels can, in a six-day race, {{distance}} a hound, horse, or a locomotive. It {{confirms the}} assumption, no longer much contested, that the human animal is superior to the other animals. But this undisputed thing is being said in too solemn and painful way at Madison Square Garden. An athletic contest in which participants 'go queer' in their heads, and strain their powers until their faces become hideous with the tortures that rack them, is not sport. It is brutality. Days and weeks of recuperation {{will be needed to}} put the Garden racers in condition, and it is likely that some of them will never recover from the strain.|$|E

500|$|John Banville wrote {{a scathing}} {{review of the}} book for The New York Review of Books. He {{described}} Saturday as the sort of <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> committee directed to produce a 'novel of our time' would write, the politics were [...] "banal"; the tone arrogant, self-satisfied and incompetent; the characters cardboard cut-outs. He felt McEwan strove too hard to display technical knowledge [...] "and his ability to put that knowledge into good, clean prose".|$|E
2500|$|Ruga's {{positioning}} of 'G' shows that alphabetic order {{related to the}} letters' values as Greek numerals was a concern even in the 3rd century BC. According to some records, the original seventh letter, 'Z', had been purged from the Latin alphabet somewhat earlier in the 3rd century BC by the Roman censor Appius Claudius, who found it distasteful and foreign. Sampson (1985) suggests that: [...] "Evidently {{the order of the}} alphabet was felt to be such a concrete <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> new letter could be added in the middle only if a 'space' was created by the dropping of an old letter." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Beatles' publicist, Derek Taylor, {{remembered that}} Paul McCartney had {{the name for}} the new company when he visited Taylor's company flat in London: [...] "We're {{starting}} a brand new form of business. So, what is the first <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> child is taught when he begins to grow up? A is for Apple". McCartney then suggested the addition of Apple Core, {{but they could not}} register the name, so they used [...] "Corps" [...] (having the same pronunciation). McCartney later revealed that he had been inspired by René Magritte's painting, Le Jeu de Mourre, featuring an apple with the words [...] "Au revoir" [...] painted on it. Harriet Vyner’s 1999 book about the late lamented charismatic London art dealer Robert Fraser, [...] "Groovy Bob", contains this anecdote by McCartney about the first time he laid eyes on the painting that would inspire the company logo in 1967: ...|$|E

That doesn't prevent his chief trait being verbal exactitude. What you people don't understand is <b>that</b> telling <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> crudely and coarsely as it happened makes it sound frightfully strange. The sort of things Keith recounts are {{not the sort of}} <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> man would make up to cover himself with honour; they are too absurd.

"One of {{the most}} {{important}} things we were looking for in casting was the actors' ability to play the subtleties – the little <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> character doesn't say or do that create the edge, the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> get under your skin and spook you," [...] Morgan said about the auditions.|$|R
