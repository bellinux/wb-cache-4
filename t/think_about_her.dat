5|$|Sterling {{agrees to}} this, {{which results in}} a hectic car chase that frightens Sterling some, despite Burt's expert driving {{that allows him to}} achieve many Hollywood driving stunts. During this, Burt tells Sterling that he needs to stop {{thinking}} of Malory as just his mother and rather think of her as a person with emotional (and sexual) needs and that he should <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> happiness and not his.

Sterling apologizes for writing the phony letter and Burt takes Malory on their date to the movie premiere.|$|E
500|$|The serial's {{official}} website describes Ruby as being carefree, though {{she puts on}} a front to hide her emotions. Ruby arrives grieving {{for the loss of}} her mother; unlike her sister, Ruby takes an [...] "internal approach and bottled it up inside", creating a facade and appearing to be strong. They also brand her as independent and she does not care what others <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> and is inclined to keep to herself.

500|$|Arriving in Geneva on December 26, the Christmas Eve, Balzac {{stayed at}} the Auberge de l'Arc, near the Maison Mirabaud where the Hański family had settled for the season. She left a ring {{for him at the}} hotel, with a note asking for a new promise of love. He gave it, and {{described}} how he began wearing the ring on his left hand, [...] "with which I hold my paper, so that the thought of you clasps me tight." [...] At this time he began working on a philosophical novel, Séraphîta, about a hermaphroditic angel united by the love of a mortal man for a compassionate and sensual woman. Balzac explained that she was his model for the latter. It was clear to all that Hański was in ill health, and Hańska began to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> future with the French author. In the meantime, she asked Balzac to begin collecting for her autographs of the famous people he spent time with in Paris and elsewhere.|$|E

500|$|During rehearsals {{and even}} during {{the run of the}} show, the music was {{repeatedly}} revised by Rodgers in an attempt to gear the songs to Traubel's voice. According to Bruce Pomahac of the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization, [...] "as she began to get cold feet about what her New York fans would <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> as a belter, the keys of each of her numbers edged upward." [...] One of Traubel's numbers saw three different versions before being scrapped in favor of, according to Pomahac, [...] "something that sounded like an excerpt from Traubel’s Vegas act." [...] "All At Once You Love Her" [...] saw some popularity when recorded, during the run of the show, by Perry Como; in what Pomahac speculates was an attempt to appease Traubel, a reprise of the song was added for her, and provided [...] "one of the loveliest moments in all of Pipe Dream". The Organization announced that a new vocal score would be published in 2012, though it has not appeared as of 2017—the existing score reflects revisions made when Nancy Andrews took over the part.|$|E
500|$|The character, of Turkish descent, is {{described}} as being [...] "torn between two worlds", which Hussen explained are her traditional family life and modern London life. Naz is a family girl who has reached a point in her life where she wants to have fun, but is also a daddy's girl, the apple of her father's eye. He sees her as a perfect student. She has {{a good relationship with}} her parents and is respectful of them, doing what they want, even though they do not know her very well. She loves her family but they do not understand her or what she wants. Hussen opined that Naz would be a good girl if her family did understand her more. What Naz wants is to be like everyone around her {{and to be able to}} pick her own boyfriend, but being from a Muslim family means she is unable to. She tries to keep each side of her life secret from the other, but more of each side is seen as the series goes on, and they eventually meet, leading to bad consequences. Hussen opined that this is a common real-life situation that is rarely portrayed on television, so girls would be able relate to the character. Naz likes to make everyone happy but ultimately is more likely to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> own happiness; she likes to get her own way.|$|E
2500|$|Theodore was {{rendered}} so distraught by his wife's {{death that}} he could not bear to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>her.</b> He almost never spoke of her again, would not allow her to be mentioned in his presence, and even omitted her name from his autobiography.

60|$|He was {{beginning}} to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> inordinately.
