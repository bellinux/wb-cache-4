The Kinks found little success with these conceptual works, and reverted {{to a traditional}} rock format throughout <b>the</b> <b>remainder</b> <b>of</b> the 1970s. Sleepwalker (1977), which heralded their return to commercial success, featured a mainstream, relatively slick production style that would become their norm.

40|$|Abstract. We {{construct}} {{higher order}} spectral shift functions, extending the perturbation theory results of M. G. Krein [15] and L. S.

The higher order spectral shift functions represent <b>the</b> <b>remainders</b> <b>of</b> higher order Taylor-type approximations; they can be expressed recursively via the lower order (in particular, Krein’s and Koplienko’s) ones. We also obtain higher order spectral averaging formulas generalizing the Birman-Solomyak spectral averaging formula. The results are obtained in the semi-finite von Neumann algebra setting, with the perturbation taken in the Hilbert-Schmidt class of the algebra. 1...|$|R
