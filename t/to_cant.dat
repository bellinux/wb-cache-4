The tilt of the gamepad is mapped to control how the virtual rifle is held. The user tilts the gamepad down to lower the rifle, and tilts the gamepad up to continuously raise the rifle up through a low ready into an aim and then to a high ready. [...] This allows users to practice muzzle discipline, by lowering the rifle to avoid muzzle sweeping friendlies, minimizing collisions when moving through tight spaces, or leading with the rifle when moving around cover. [...] Once the rifle is raised into an aim position, the user's head motion aligns the sight picture. [...] The user rolls the gamepad (tilting it side to side) <b>to</b> <b>cant</b> the weapon.
