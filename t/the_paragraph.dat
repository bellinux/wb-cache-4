25|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, a {{paragraph}} alleged to come from a 1956 interview of Ariel Sharon, conducted by an Israel Defense Forces general named Ouze Merham, was quoted in a number of publications. <b>The</b> <b>paragraph</b> advocates burning Palestinian children and raping Palestinian women and Arab girls, as well as Sharon claiming to have killed 750 Palestinian civilians during the Suez Crisis. The interview, <b>the</b> <b>paragraph,</b> and the existence of Ouze Merham himself have been denounced as fabrications. In 1956 Sharon, who later became Prime Minister of Israel, was a major in the IDF.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{information}} contained in the document can be retrieved from its most significant paragraph, rather than by reading the whole document. The proposed work ranks <b>the</b> <b>paragraphs</b> of a text document using eigen analysis and returns <b>the</b> most important <b>paragraph</b> of a document. The importance of each paragraph is determined based on the correlation between <b>the</b> <b>paragraphs.</b> <b>The</b> proposed method explores the use of fuzzy graphs in capturing the inter-paragraph correlation of text documents. This approach models the document as a fuzzy graph where a node refers to a paragraph and an edge indicates the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>paragraphs.</b> <b>The</b> correlation between <b>paragraphs</b> is measured by extracting their semantic similarity. The importance of each node is determined based on this correlation. Subsequently the system ranks <b>the</b> <b>paragraphs</b> according to their importance. The proposed system is evaluated using DUC 2001 data set. The ROUGE scores show that <b>the</b> significant <b>paragraph</b> suggested by <b>the</b> proposed method covers relatively {{a good amount of}} relevant information in the document...|$|R
50|$|The {{wording of}} the {{qualified}} report {{is very similar to}} the Unqualified opinion, but an explanatory paragraph is added to explain the reasons for the qualification after <b>the</b> scope <b>paragraph</b> but before <b>the</b> opinion <b>paragraph.</b> <b>The</b> introductory <b>paragraph</b> is left exactly the same as in the unqualified opinion, while the scope and <b>the</b> opinion <b>paragraphs</b> receive a slight modification in line with the qualification in <b>the</b> explanatory <b>paragraph.</b>|$|R

25|$|Note that <b>the</b> <b>paragraph</b> above {{cites the}} Fourteenth Amendment {{and not the}} First Amendment. This is because the Fourteenth Amendment {{incorporates}} the First and makes it applicable to the States. As literally written, the First Amendment applies to Congress and the federal government, not the states.|$|E
25|$|While the Nazi {{persecution}} of homosexuals is reasonably well known today, {{far less attention}} has been given to the continuation of this persecution in post-war Germany. In 1945, after the concentration camps were liberated, some homosexual prisoners were recalled to custody to serve out their two-year sentence under Paragraph 175. In 1950, East Germany abolished Nazi amendments to Paragraph 175, whereas West Germany kept them and even had them confirmed by its Constitutional Court. About 100,000 men were implicated in legal proceedings from 1945 to 1969, and about 50,000 were convicted. Some individuals accused under Paragraph 175 committed suicide. In 1969, the government eased Paragraph 175 by providing for an age of consent of 21. The age of consent was lowered to 18 in 1973, and finally, in 1994, <b>the</b> <b>paragraph</b> was repealed and the age of consent lowered to 14, the same that is in force for heterosexual acts. East Germany had already reformed its more lenient version of <b>the</b> <b>paragraph</b> in 1968, and repealed it in 1988.|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} of a strong reducing agent, such as ascorbic acid, to a sulfide-containing solution is sometimes used to prevent sulfide oxidation from atmospheric oxygen. Although it is certainly a sound precaution for the determination of sulfide with an ion selective electrode, it might however hamper {{the development of the}} blue color if the freshly formed methylene blue is also reduced, as described here above in <b>the</b> <b>paragraph</b> on redox indicator.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> first <b>paragraph</b> (commonly {{referred}} to as <b>the</b> introductory <b>paragraph)</b> states <b>the</b> audit work performed and identifies {{the responsibilities of the}} auditor and the auditee in relation to the financial statements. <b>The</b> second <b>paragraph</b> (commonly {{referred to}} as <b>the</b> scope <b>paragraph)</b> details <b>the</b> scope of audit work, provides a general description {{of the nature of the}} work, examples of procedures performed, and any limitations the audit faced based on the nature of <b>the</b> work. This <b>paragraph</b> also states that the audit was performed in accordance with the country's prevailing generally accepted auditing standards and regulations. <b>The</b> third <b>paragraph</b> (commonly {{referred to as}} <b>the</b> opinion <b>paragraph)</b> simply states <b>the</b> auditor's opinion on the financial statements and whether they are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.|$|R
30|$|Till the {{amendment}} of the BNatSchG in 2002, the acknowledged environmental organisations {{were referred to}} as § 29 -organisations, <b>the</b> respective <b>paragraph</b> on <b>the</b> participation of environmental organisations being § 29 BNatschG war. The amendment of BNatSchG changed the numbering of <b>the</b> <b>paragraphs.</b> <b>The</b> participation of environmental organisations now follows § 58 BNatschG.|$|R
25|$|In 1876, a new LDS Church edition renumbered {{most of the}} {{sections}} in a roughly chronological order instead of the earlier topical order, and included 26 sections not included in previous editions, now numbered as sections 2, 13, 77, 85, 87, 108–111, 113–118, 120–123, 125, 126, 129–132, and 136. Previous editions had been divided into verses with the early versifications generally following <b>the</b> <b>paragraph</b> structure of the original text. It was with the 1876 edition that the currently used versification was first employed.|$|E
25|$|At the Maariv Amidah {{following}} {{the conclusion of}} a Shabbat or Yom Tov, a paragraph beginning Atah Chonantanu ("You have granted us...") is inserted into the weekday Amidah's fourth blessing of Binah. <b>The</b> <b>paragraph</b> thanks God for the ability to separate between the holy and mundane, paraphrasing the concepts found in the Havdalah ceremony. In fact, the Talmud teaches that if this paragraph is forgotten, the Amidah need not be repeated, because Havdalah will be said later over wine. Once Atah Chonantanu is said, work prohibited on the holy day becomes permitted because the separation from the holy day has been established.|$|E
25|$|Some wikis have an Edit button or link {{directly}} on the page being viewed, if the user has permission to edit the page. This {{can lead to a}} text-based editing page where participants can structure and format wiki pages with a simplified markup language, sometimes known as Wikitext or Wiki markup (it can also lead to a WYSIWYG editing page; see <b>the</b> <b>paragraph</b> after the table below). For example, starting lines of text with asterisks could create a bulleted list. The style and syntax of wikitexts can vary greatly among wiki implementations, some of which also allow HTML tags.|$|E

25|$|In view {{of these}} developments, {{two years before}} the 1871 {{founding}} of the German Empire, the Prussian kingdom, worried over the future of <b>the</b> <b>paragraph,</b> sought a scientific basis for this piece of legislation. The Ministry of Justice assigned a Deputation für das Medizinalwesen ("Deputation for medical knowledge"), including, among others, the famous physicians Rudolf Virchow and Heinrich Adolf von Bardeleben, who, however, stated in their appraisal of March 24, 1869 that they were unable to give a scientific grounding for a law that outlawed zoophilia and male homosexual intercourse, distinguishing them from the many other sexual acts that were not even considered as matters of penal law.|$|E
25|$|Another, easier {{equation}} {{that can}} be applied to get the correct molecular formula of the CFC/R/Freon class compounds is this to take the numbering and add 90 to it. The resulting value will give the number of carbons as the first numeral, the second numeral gives the number of hydrogen atoms, and the third numeral gives the number of fluorine atoms. The rest of the unaccounted carbon bonds are occupied by chlorine atoms. The value of this equation is always a three figure number. An easy example is that of CFC-12, which gives: 90+12=102 -> 1 carbon, 0 hydrogens, 2 fluorine atoms, and hence 2 chlorine atoms resulting in CCl2F2. The main advantage of this method of deducing the molecular composition in comparison with the method described in <b>the</b> <b>paragraph</b> above is that it gives the number of carbon atoms of the molecule.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the present}} Olympic AA scoring system — New Life — Davydova {{would have won}} the 1980 AA title by a larger margin and would have won gold on beam. In {{addition}} to the AA gold, Davydova {{won a gold medal}} with the team and a silver medal on balance beam. While recognised as the best vaulter in event finals Davydova failed to stand her second vault and thus failed to medal. This vault is described below in <b>the</b> <b>paragraph</b> on the 1981 World Championships. In 1980 the gymnasts performed 2 different vaults and the scores were averaged instead of taking the best of the 2 scores as in Montreal Olympics ef. Davydova would have won gold with her 1st vault – scoring 9.95 – if the Montreal rules had still applied. Donnerstag 215,11 September 1980,"This gymnast led the way into the future in the vault finals, where she performed a flip flop salto with a pirouette off the board".|$|E

25|$|The graphic {{timetable}} is a two-dimensional {{image of the}} train journeys. Time is displayed horizontally from midnight XII o'clock to midnight XII o'clock. The stations along the journey, from Zug and Lucerne to Chiasso, Locarno and Luino are displayed vertically. The first scheduled train, an express train with 1st, 2nd and 3rd class carriages, leaves Bellinzona at 03:17am. The train with the number55 {{is powered by a}} steam locomotive and, according to the timetable, does not make a scheduled stop at Giubiasco, Rivera-Bironico and Taverne. Arrival at Lugano is scheduled at 04:09am, from where it leaves again at 04:14am. In 1899 the entire train journey from Bellinzona to Lugano was scheduled to be 52minutes. Today(2017), the same journey on one of the EC trains takes 27 minutes. The illustrations shows that between Giubiasco and Rivera Bironico trains do not pass each other as in 1899 this was, as mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>paragraph</b> above, a single track line. This information can thus be drawn form both, the stations' track layout and the {{graphic timetable}}. Also visible on the graphic timetable is the fact that between Osogna and Biasca, trains however do pass each other along their journeys, it being a double-track line. Further, the Arth-Rigi-Bahn's trains (nowadays Rigi Railways), are also listed in the Gotthard railways' timetable. The timetable's scale is 15mm/hour horizontally and 1.75mm/km vertically.|$|E
