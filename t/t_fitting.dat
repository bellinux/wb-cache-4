Thus it makes sense for us to further search for distributions which can be used to fit heavy tailed data. Our proposed slash and skew-slash t distributions can be considered as an example in this attempt. We complete our remarks by pointing out that the degrees-of-freedom parameter r and the tail parameter q would explain different types of fat tail behaviors existed in data.|$|E

The molar magnetic susceptibility chi(0) of a powdered sample was measured in the temperature range 2 K < T < 273 K, and an isothermal magnetization curve, M(B(0),T), was obtained at T = 30 K, with the magnetic field B(0) between 0 and 5 <b>T.</b> <b>Fitting</b> a spin-chain model to the susceptibility data, we evaluate an antiferromagnetic exchange coupling 2 J = - 24. 3 (1) cm(- 1) (defined as H(ex) = - 2 JS(i) S(j)) between Cu(II) neighbors. For any orientation of B(0), single-crystal electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra obtained at 9. 8 and 33. 9 GHz at 300 K display a single signal having a g matrix with orthorhombic symmetry, arising from the merger produced by the exchange interaction of the resonances corresponding to the two rotated Cu(II) sites.

Information on the role of the tar yield of cigarettes in upper digestive tract carcinogenesis is sparse and needs to be updated because the tar yield of cigarettes has steadily decreased over the last few decades.

Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated by unconditional multiple logistic regression models, including terms for age, sex, study centre, education and alcohol consumption. RESULTS: Based on the brand of cigarettes smoked for the longest time, the multivariate ORs for current smokers compared with never smokers were 6. 1 for or= 20 mg tar for oral and pharyngeal neoplasms, and 4. 8 and 5. 4 for oesophageal cancer, respectively.

40|$|Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) {{have the}} {{potential}} to enhance socioeconomic mobility through education. Yet, the viability of this outcome largely depends on the reputation of MOOC certificates as a credible academic credential. I describe a cheating strategy that threatens this reputation and holds the potential to render the MOOC certificate valueless. The strategy, Copying Answers using Multiple Existences Online (CAMEO), involves a user who gathers solutions to assessment questions using one or more harvester accounts and then submits correct answers using one or more separate master accounts. To estimate a lower bound for CAMEO prevalence among 1. 9 million course participants in 115 HarvardX and MITx courses, I introduce a filter-based CAMEO detection algorithm and use a small-scale experiment to verify CAMEO use with certainty. I identify preventive strategies that can decrease CAMEO rates and show evidence of their effectiveness in science courses. Because the CAMEO algorithm functions as a lower bound estimate, it fails to detect many CAMEO cheaters. As a novelty of this thesis, instead of improving the shortcomings of the CAMEO algorithm directly, I recognize that we can think of the CAMEO algorithm as a method for producing noisy predicted cheating labels. Then a solution to the more general problem of binary classification with noisy labels (~ P̃̃̃ Ñ learning) is a solution to CAMEO cheating detection. ~ P̃ Ñ learning is the problem of binary classification when training examples may be mislabeled (flipped) uniformly with noise rate 1 for positive examples and 0 for negative examples. I propose Rank Pruning to solve ~ P ~N learning and the open problem of estimating the noise rates. Unlike prior solutions, Rank Pruning is efficient and general, requiring O(T) for any unrestricted choice of probabilistic classifier with <b>T</b> <b>fitting</b> time. I prove Rank Pruning achieves consistent noise estimation and equivalent expected risk as learning with uncorrupted labels in ideal conditions, and derive closed-form solutions when conditions are non-ideal. Rank Pruning achieves state-of-the-art noise rate estimation and F 1, error, and AUC-PR on the MNIST and CIFAR datasets, regardless of noise rates. To highlight, Rank Pruning with a CNN classifier can predict if a MNIST digit is a one or not one with only 0 : 25 % error, and 0 : 46 % error across all digits, even when 50 % of positive examples are mislabeled and 50 % of observed positive labels are mislabeled negative examples. Rank Pruning achieves similarly impressive results when as large as 50 % of training examples are actually just noise drawn from a third distribution. Together, the CAMEO and Rank Pruning algorithms allow for a robust, general, and time-efficient solution to the CAMEO cheating detection problem. By ensuring the validity of MOOC credentials, we enable MOOCs to achieve both openness and value, and thus take one step closer to the greater goal of democratization of education. by Curtis George Northcutt.

40|$|The growing need {{of energy}} {{worldwide}} has {{lead to an}} increasing demand for alternative sources of power generation. Thermoelectric materials {{are one of the}} ‘green energy sources’ which convert directly heat into electricity, and vice–versa. The efficiency of this conversion is dependent on ‘figure of merit’ (z T), which depends on the material’s Seebeck coefficient (S), electrical resistivity (ρ) and thermal conductivity (κ) through the relation z T=S 2 T/ρκ, where T is the temperature. High values of z T lead to high efficiency, and therefore, z T must be maximized. Lead telluride is well–established thermoelectric material in the temperature range 350 K and 850 K. The aim of this thesis is to improve the z T of the material by adopting two different approaches – (i) doping/alloying and (ii) introducing additional interfaces in bulk i. e. having two phase PbTe. In this thesis, first an introduction about the thermoelectric phenomenon is given, along with the material parameters on which z T depends. A survey of literature associated with PbTe is done and the current status of thermoelectric devices is summarized briefly. This is followed by a description of the synthesis procedure and the measurement techniques adopted in this work. The first approach is the conventional alloying and doping of the material by which carrier concentration of the material is controlled so that maximum power factor Sρ 2 is achieved and a simultaneous reduction of thermal conductivity takes place by mass fluctuation scattering. Under this, two systems have been studied. The first system is PbTe 1 −ySey alloys doped with In (nominal composition: Pb 0. 999 In 0. 001 Te 1 −ySey, y= 0. 01, 0. 05, 0. 10, 0. 20, 0. 25, 0. 30). The compounds were single phase and polycrystalline. Lattice constants obtained from Rietveld refinement of X–ray diffraction (XRD) data showed that Vegard’s law was followed, indicating solid solution formation between PbTe and PbSe. Compositional analysis showed lower indium content than the nominal composition. Temperature dependent Seebeck coefficient showed all the samples to be n–type while Pisarenko plots showed that indium did not act as a resonant dopant. Electrical resistivity increased with temperature, while mobility vs <b>T</b> <b>fitting</b> showed a mixed scattering mechanism of acoustic phonon and ionized impurity scattering. Thermal conductivity followed a T 1 dependence, which indicated acoustic phonon scattering. At high temperature, slight bipolar effect was observed, which showed the importance of control-ling carrier concentration for good thermoelectric properties. A z T of 0. 66 was achieved at 800 K. The second alloy studied under this approach was Mn doped Pb 1 −ySnyTe alloy (nominal composition Pb 0. 96 −yMn 0. 04 SnyTe (y= 0. 56, 0. 64, 0. 72, 0. 80)). All the samples followed Vegard’s law, showing formation of complete solid solution between PbTe and SnTe. Microstructure analysis showed grain size distribution of < 1 µm to more than 10 µm. Seebeck coefficient showed all samples were p-type and the role of two valence band conduction in p–type PbTe based materials. Electrical resistivity showed a de-crease possibly due to (i) large carrier concentration or (ii) increased mobility due to Mn 2 + ions. Thermal conductivity decreased systematically with decreasing Sn content. Bipolar effect was observed at high temperatures. Accordingly, the highest z T of 0. 82 at 720 K was obtained for the sample with Sn (y= 0. 56) content due to optimum carrier concentration and maximum disorder. The second approach of having additional interfaces in bulk focuses on reducing thermal conductivity by scattering phonons. Under this approach, three systems were studied. The first system is PbTe with bismuth (Bi) secondary phase. The XRD and Ra-man studies showed that bismuth was not a dopant in PbTe, while micrographs showed micrometer–sized Bi secondary phase dispersed in bulk of PbTe. Reduction in Seebeck coeﬃcient showed possible hole donation across PbTe–Bi interfaces, while electrical re-sistivity and thermal conductivity showed that the role of electrons at the interfaces was more important than phonons for the present bismuth concentrations. For the parent PbTe, z T of 0. 8 at 725 K was reached, which, however decreased for bismuth added samples. The second system studied under the two phase approach was indium (In) added PbTe. Indium was not found to act as dopant in PbTe, while micrometer sized indium phase was found in PbTe bulk. A decrease in the electronic thermal conductivity ac-companied by a simultaneous increase of the electrical resistivity and Seebeck coeﬃcient throughout the measurement range indicated increased scattering of electrons at PbTe-In interfaces. Higher values of the lattice thermal conductivity showed that the PbTe–In interfaces were ineﬀective at scattering phonons, which was initially expected due to the lattice mismatch between PbTe and In. For PbTe with 3 at. % In phase, z T value of 0. 78 at 723 K was achieved. Under the two phase approach, as a comparative study, PbTe with both micrometer sized Bi and In phases together was prepared, in which no improvement in z T was found. A comparison of both the approaches showed that the alloying approach is better than the two–phase approach. This is because micrometer sized secondary phase scatter the electrons more than the phonons, leading to adverse eﬀect on the transport coef-ficients, and hence, on z T. Alloying, on the other hand, is more beneficial in reducing thermal conductivity by mass fluctuation scattering, along with a simultaneous reduction of electrical resistivity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{magnetic}} properties of ultrathin Fe 100 films were investigated by Polarized Neutron Reflectometry PNR. Fe films with different thicknesses from 1 nm to 3 nm were prepared by Molecular Beam Epitaxy MBE on a V buffer layer, which was deposited on a MgO 100 single crystal. In {{order to avoid}} oxidation the Fe films were covered with V capping layers. During the preparation process {{the growth of the}} films was monitored by Low Energy Electron Diffraction LEED and Auger Electron Spectroscopy AES. Combining the information obtained from PNR with x ray reflectometry XRR, the thicknesses of the Fe and V layers were determined precisely. From PNR measurements the absolute value of the magnetization of the films could be determined by fitting the spin up and spin down neutron reflectivities separately. The magnetic moments of the Fe films show a perfect linear dependence on the film thickness <b>t.</b> The <b>fitting</b> line intersects the abscissa at t 0. 1 amp; 61617; 0. 01 nm. This means that the {{magnetic properties}} of the two V Fe interfaces show up as a constant reduction of the magnetic moment equal to an Fe bulk layer of thickness t 0. 1 amp; 61617; 0. 01 nm...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA ∗-compactification of a T 1 quasi-uniform space (X,U) is {{a compact}} T 1 quasi-uniform space (Y,V) {{that has a}} T(V∗) -dense {{subspace}} quasi-isomorphic to (X,U), where V∗ denotes the coarsest uniformity finer than V. With {{the help of the}} notion of T 1 ∗-half completion of a quasi-uniform space, which is introduced and studied here, we show that if a T 1 quasi-uniform space (X,U) has a ∗-compactification, then it is unique up to quasi-isomorphism. We identify the ∗-compactification of (X,U) with the subspace of its bicompletion (X,U) consisting of all points which are closed in (X,T(U)) and prove that (X,U) is ∗-compactifiable if and only if it is point symmetric and (X,U) is compact. Finally, we discuss some properties of locally <b>fitting</b> <b>T</b> 0 quasi-uniform spaces, a large class of quasi-uniform spaces whose bicompletion is T 1, and, hence, they are T 1 ∗-half completable...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To improve {{myocardial}} {{and blood}} T 1 measurements with a multi-variable <b>T</b> 1 <b>fitting</b> model specifically modified for a segmented multi-shot FLASH sequence. METHODS: The proposed method was first evaluated {{in a series}} of phantoms simulating realistic tissues, and then in healthy rats (n = 8) and rats with acute myocardial infarction (MI) induced by coronary artery ligation (n = 8). RESULTS: By taking into account the saturation effect caused by sampling α-train pulses, and the longitudinal magnetization recovery between readouts, our model provided more accurate T 1 estimate than the conventional three-parameter fit in phantoms under realistic gating procedures (error of - 0. 42 ± 1. 73 % versus - 3. 40 ± 1. 46 %, respectively, when using the measured inversion efficiency, β). The baseline myocardial T 1 values in healthy rats was 1636. 3 ± 23. 4 ms at 7 Tesla. One day postligation, the T 1 values in the remote and proximal myocardial areas were 1637. 5 ± 62. 6 ms and 1740. 3 ± 70. 5 ms, respectively. In rats with acute MI, regional differences in myocardial T 1 values were observed {{both before and after the}} administration of gadolinium. CONCLUSION: The proposed method has improved T 1 estimate as validated in phantoms and could advance applications in rodents using quantitative myocardial T 1 mapping.

40|$|To analyse the {{relationship}} between occlusion, posture and athletic performance in 15 professional basketball players. MATERIALS AND METHOD; The athletes {{were divided into two}} groups; the 8 subjects in the test group were fitted with retainers and the 7 subjects in the other group were used as control. All of the athletes underwent electromyographic and kinaesiographic examination with Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) before and after muscular relaxation to identify the myocentric position and to permit individualisation of the retainers. The effect of the intraoral devices on explosive force was evaluated via two functional tests: the countermovement jump (CMJ), and unilateral (UL) and bilateral (BL) stiffness jumps. The functional tests were carried out both before (T 0) and immediately after (<b>T</b> 1) <b>fitting</b> the retainer in an initial session, and then again, in a second session held two months later both without (T 2) and with the retainer in place (T 3). Statistical analysis of the data obtained revealed a statistically significant difference between T 3 and T 0, and between T 3 and T 2 in the study group, and between T 0 and T 3 in the control group; no statistically {{significant differences between the two}} groups were found. The results of this analysis lead us to conclude that the retainers had no effect on athletic performance, and that the improvement in this criteria noted in both groups in the second session was probably brought about by training...|$|R
40|$|To {{develop a}} novel method for rapid {{myocardial}} T 1 mapping at high spatial resolution. METHODS: The proposed strategy represents a single-shot inversion-recovery (IR) experiment triggered to early diastole during a brief breathhold. The measurement combines an adiabatic inversion pulse with a real-time readout by highly undersampled radial FLASH, iterative image reconstruction and <b>T</b> 1 <b>fitting</b> with automatic deletion of systolic frames. The method was implemented on a 3 T MRI system using a GPU-equipped bypass computer for online application. Validations employed a T 1 reference phantom including analyses at simulated heart rates from 40 to 100 bpm. In vivo applications involved myocardial T 1 mapping in short-axis views of healthy young volunteers. RESULTS: At 1 mm in-plane resolution and 6 mm section thickness, the IR measurement could be shortened to 3 s without compromising T 1 quantitation. Phantom studies demonstrated T 1 accuracy and high precision for values ranging from 300 to 1500 ms {{and up to}} a heart rate of 100 bpm. Similar results were obtained in vivo yielding septal T 1 values of 1246 ± 24 ms (base), 1256 ± 33 ms (mid-ventricular) and 1288 ± 30 ms (apex), respectively (mean ± SD, n= 6). CONCLUSION: Diastolic myocardial T 1 mapping with use of single-shot inversion-recovery FLASH offers high spatial resolution, T 1 accuracy and precision, practical robustness and speed. Advances in knowledge: The proposed method will be beneficial for clinical applications relying on native and post-contrast T 1 quantitation...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{majority}} of the people in low-income countries, who need assistive technology {{do not have access to}} prosthetic devices [1]. Instead of these people having to make a long journey to one of the few prosthetic workshops, solutions like the Modular Socket System (MSS, Össur®) may be useful, because potentially they could be delivered and manufactured on site, at the location of the person [2]. This could make it suitable for application in a Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR) setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the technical feasibility of the MSS for implementation in a CBR setting in terms of required tools, skills and required production time. METHODS: The study was performed at the Department of Prosthetics & Orthotics of the Jakarta I Polytechnic School of Health Science (JSPO). Four JSPO students received a three days training in manufacturing of the MSS. Lower limb amputees were recruited to participate in this study from the region of Jakarta (n = 5) and Bali (n = 10). A set of standardized instruments including the two minutes’ walking test (2 MWT) and Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) were used to measure performance and satisfaction with the prosthesis. Production and maintenance logbooks were filled out by the involved prosthetists to evaluate the technical feasibility of the MSS. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Performance (2 MWT) and satisfaction (PEQ) scores were comparable to that of similar studies with other lower leg prostheses [3, 4]. Both measures did not decrease significantly over time (Figure 1). This suggest that the JSPO students were able to reach sufficient quality. It took the prosthetists 3. 5 to 10. 5 hours to fit an amputee with a MSS prosthesis. Mean socket production time was 2. 0 ± 0. 6 hours and mean prosthesis assembly and fitting time was 4. 1 ± 2. 6 hours. The only non-portable machine needed for the production of the prosthesis was a grinding machine (router). Smaller portable machines used were a cast cutter/jigsaw, Icecast® Compact and resin injection tool. If in the future the grinding machine will be replaced by a handheld tool, production of the MSS could be performed on site, making it suitable for use in a rural setting. Figure 1 : The results of the 2 MWT at the moment of <b>fitting</b> (<b>t</b> 0), at 1 - 3 months post <b>fitting</b> (<b>t</b> 1), and at the end evaluation at 4 - 6 months post <b>fitting</b> (<b>t</b> 2). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who normally have to travel long distances to access prosthetic services were only required to make one visit to the health facility in order to receive a prosthesis. From a technical and quality perspective the method seems feasible, although, high costs remain an issue.

25|$|Knox set out {{to address}} the first problem, in his article {{published}} in the November issue of the New York Medical Journal in 1913. In this paper, he put forth two new performance tests, that were not based on verbal or cultural knowledge. The Cube Imitation Test, also known as Knox Cubes, consisted of four large black cubes and one small black cube. The examiner moves the small cube slowly and deliberately in various patterns {{in relation to the}} larger four cubes. The examinee is asked to imitate the movements conducted by the examiner. Each trial increases in difficulty and complexity. He also introduced a form board test (called the Geographical Puzzle, or “G” <b>Test),</b> which involved <b>fitting</b> pieces into proper places on a board, requiring both motor coordination as well as decision making. He believed that together these two tests could determine with increased accuracy whether an emigrant was mentally deficient, as neither required specific cultural knowledge for successful performance.|$|R
40|$|We re-examine {{a string}} dual model for elastic proton-proton {{scattering}} via Pomeron exchange. We {{argue that the}} method of "Reggeizing" a propagator {{to take into account}} an entire trajectory of exchanged particles can be generalized, in particular by modifying the value of the mass-shell parameter in the model. We then fit the generalized model to scattering data at large s and small <b>t.</b> The <b>fitting</b> results are inconclusive, but suggest that a better fit might be obtained by allowing the mass-shell to vary. The model fits the data equally well (roughly) {{for a wide range of}} values of the mass-shell parameter, but the other fitting parameters (the slope and intercept of the Regge trajectory, and the coupling constant and dipole mass from the proton-proton-glueball coupling) are then inconsistent with what we expect. On the other hand, using the traditional method of Reggeization generates a weaker fit, but the other parameters obtain more physically reasonable values. In analyzing the fitting results, we also found that our model is more consistent with the sqrt(s) = 1800 GeV coming from the E 710 experiment than that coming from the CDF experiment, and that our model has the greatest discrepancy with the data in the range 0. 5 GeV^ 2 < |t| < 0. 6 GeV^ 2, suggesting that the transition from soft Pomeron to hard Pomeron may occur closer to t = - 0. 5 GeV^ 2 rather than t = - 0. 6 GeV^ 2 as previously thought.
