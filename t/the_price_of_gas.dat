40|$|This article {{develops}} a formal model for comparing the cost {{structure of the}} two main transport options for natural gas: liquefied natural gas (LNG) and pipelines. In particular, it evaluates how vari-ations in <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>gas</b> and greenhouse gas emissions affect the relative cost-efficiency of these two options. Natural gas is often promoted as the most environmentally friendly of all fossil fuels, and LNG as a modern and efficient way of transporting it. Some research {{has been carried out}} into the local environmental impact of LNG facilities, but almost none into aspects related to climate change. This paper concludes that at current price levels for natural gas and CO 2 emissions the distance from field to consumer and the volume <b>of</b> natural <b>gas</b> transported are the main determinants <b>of</b> transport costs. <b>The</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>gas</b> and greenhouse emissions influence the relative cost-efficiency of LNG and pipeline transport, but only to a limited degree at current price levels. Because more energy is required for the LNG process (especially for fuelling the liquefaction process) than for pipelines at distances below 9100 km, LNG is more exposed to variability in <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>gas</b> and greenhouse gas emissions up to this distance. If <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>gas</b> and/or greenhouse gas emission rise dramatically in the future, this will affect the choice between pipelines and LNG. Such a price increase will be favourable for pipelines relative to LNG...|$|R

2500|$|The {{price of}} natural gas varies greatly {{depending}} on location and type of consumer. In 2007, a price of $7 per 1000 cubic feet (about 25 cents per m3) was typical in the United States. The typical caloric value {{of natural gas}} is roughly 1,000 British thermal units (BTU) per cubic foot, depending on gas composition. This corresponds to around $7 per million BTU, or around $7 per gigajoule. In April 2008, the wholesale price was $10 per [...] ($10/MMBTU). The residential price varies from 50% to 300% more than the wholesale price. At the end of 2007, this was $12–$16 per 1000 cubic feet (about 50 cents per m3).

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} {{establish}} that crude {{oil and natural}} gas prices are cointegrated, so that changes in <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> oil appear to translate into changes in <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>gas.</b> Yet at times in the past, and very powerfully in the last two years, many voices have noted that <b>the</b> two <b>prices</b> series appear to have "decoupled". We explore the apparent contradiction between these two views. Although we also find that the two series are cointegrated, recognition of the statistical fact of cointegration needs to be tempered with two additional points that we think have been insufficiently emphasized in the past literature. First, there is an enormous amount of unexplained volatility in natural gas prices at short horizons. Hence, any simple formulaic relationship between <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> oil and <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>gas</b> will leave a large portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>gas</b> unexplained.

Estimates for 1961 - 68 and 1961 - 69 discoveries are reported for a dynamic model, using time series of cross sections. Estimation is done first for a one-intercept model. Alternatively, the units (districts) are grouped by geological and geophysical characteristics, and estimates are derived for the grouped-districts model. This model yields generally better results. The inclusion of 1969 in the sampled period does not alter the results reported for 1961 - 68, and the discussion centers on the 1961 - 69 estimates. Conditional forecasts of 1970 discoveries indicate a drop of one-fifth to one-fourth of 1969 discoveries.
