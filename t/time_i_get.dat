500|$|Though Glen Campbell became {{better known}} as a highly {{successful}} country music artist in his own right, he played guitar in the Wrecking Crew during the 1960s and appeared along with them on several of the Beach Boys' classics of the period such as [...] "I Get Around" [...] and [...] "Help Me Rhonda". [...] In 1965 he toured with the Beach Boys, and in 1966 he and the Wrecking Crew played on the Pet Sounds album. [...] Campbell enlisted the Wrecking Crew as a backup unit on many of his own solo records during the 1960s, such as on [...] "Gentle on My Mind", and on two songs written by Jimmy Webb, [...] "By the <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> to Phoenix" [...] and his single [...] "Wichita Lineman".|$|E
500|$|After {{many years}} of {{releasing}} studio albums of newly recorded material, McEntire's nineteenth studio album, Starting Over (1995) was collection of her favorite songs originally recorded by others from the 1950s through the early 1980s. The album was made to commemorate twenty years in the music industry, but many music critics gave it a less positive response than her previous release. Allmusics Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented that although the album was considered a [...] "rebirth" [...] for McEntire, he thought that some tracks were recorded for merely [...] "nothing more than entertainment". The album paid tribute to many of McEntire's favorite artists and included cover versions of [...] "Talking In Your Sleep" [...] originally sung by Crystal Gayle, [...] "Please Come to Boston", [...] "I Won't Mention It Again" [...] sung by Ray Price, [...] "Starting Over Again", cowritten by Donna Summer and originally a hit for Dolly Parton, [...] "On My Own", and [...] "By the <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> to Phoenix". [...] "On My Own" [...] featured guest vocals from Davis, as well as Martina McBride and Trisha Yearwood.|$|E
500|$|In February 2012, Anthony and Tyler get {{involved}} with criminal Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). Of this storyline Lapinksas said, [...] "I loved the challenge. Every time you get a big storyline and lots of scripts, it's fantastic– there's lots to sink your teeth into. Myself, Jamie and Tony Discipline sat down and spoke about the scenes beforehand, discussing {{how we were going}} to perform them. It's like taking on a new project, so every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> a new storyline, I'm hands-on and ready to go for it." [...] On the scenes involving Anthony, Tyler and Derek, Lapinskas said, [...] "I think it was definitely a shock for them to see his true colours! Anthony was really worried as he didn't want them to get into trouble, so as we saw, he was trying his best {{to get them out of}} it. But even though they were scared of Derek, Anthony and Tyler are brothers and they've got each other's backs, so it was nice that we saw them standing up to Derek in some of the scenes." ...|$|E

500|$|A dance song of {{four minutes}} and twenty-two seconds in length, [...] "Since I Left You" [...] is {{primarily}} sample-based. The track features doo-wop vocal harmonies and employs various pieces of instrumentation, including organs, flutes and acoustic guitars. Its chorus, sampled from [...] "Everyday" [...] by the Main Attraction, features a woman singing about leaving her lover. The [...] "Everyday" [...] sample {{was the final}} element of [...] "Since I Left You" [...] to be added by Chater and Seltmann, and the former stated that its addition was a moment when they [...] "really succeeded in writing a pop song." [...] The original song described a woman's happiness after meeting a man, but Chater and Seltmann re-arranged various vocals to make the final sample appear to describe a break-up. Other sample sources include Rose Royce's [...] "Daddy Rich", Tony Mottola's [...] "Anema e core" [...] and [...] "By the <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> to Phoenix", the Duprees' [...] "The Sky's the Limit", Lamont Dozier's [...] "Take Off Your Make-Up" [...] and Klaus Wunderlich's [...] "Let's Do the Latin Hustle".|$|E
500|$|Carol Kaye {{provided}} {{an exception to}} the predominantly male world of Los Angeles session work in the 1960s. [...] Originally a guitarist, she began doing session work in Los Angeles in the late 1950s, playing behind Ritchie Valens on [...] "La Bamba" [...] and in the 1960s becoming a regular contributor on Phil Spector's recordings as well as on Beach Boys songs, such as [...] "Help Me, Rhonda" [...] and their subsequent Pet Sounds and Smile LPs. [...] Ray Pohlman, who had assumed an early leadership position in the Wrecking Crew, became the musical director for the Shindig! TV show in 1965, resulting in reduced studio work from that point on. [...] After Pohlman's move to television, Kaye began to gravitate to the electric bass. [...] She supplied the signature bass line in Sonny and Cher's [...] "The Beat Goes On" [...] released in 1967. [...] Joe Osborn played bass on numerous Wrecking Crew-backed songs, such as Glen Campbell's [...] "By the <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> to Phoenix", The Mamas & the Papas' [...] "California Dreamin'", Richard Harris' [...] "MacArthur Park", and the 5th Dimension's [...] "Up, Up and Away". [...] Other notable electric bassists who played with the Wrecking Crew were Bill Pitman, Max Bennett, Red Callender, Chuck Rainey, and Bob West, as well as Jimmy Bond, Lyle Ritz, Chuck Berghofer, who played acoustic upright bass.|$|E
500|$|The twins' mother Rina {{said that}} when they were two years old, they would take pot lids out of the {{cupboards}} and run around the kitchen, going [...] "Vroom, vroom," [...] like they were driving cars– this before they had seen a car. In 1945, {{at the age of}} five, he and Aldo were racing their hand-crafted wooden cars through the steep streets of their hometown. Later, the brothers were hired by a garage to park cars, Andretti described the experience in his book What's It Like Out There: [...] "The first time I fired up a car, felt the engine shudder and the wheel come to life in my hands, I was hooked. It was a feeling I can't describe. I still get it every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> into a race car." [...] Andretti's first racing experience was in a new youth racing league called Formula Junior [...] in Ancona, Italy when he was thirteen years old. However, the [...] Formula Junior story is likely apocryphal. In an interview during an , Mr. Andretti recounts the story of his early days of Dirt Track racing in Pennsylvania with his brother, Aldo, and implies that he and his brother made up the story of racing in the Formula Junior league because they looked the part after having purchased racing suits from Italy.|$|E

500|$|Johnson {{called his}} U.S.-based {{advisers}} to his Texas ranch for discussions on Christmas Day. Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara advised Johnson to reject Taylor's proposal. Johnson declined to act, stating that an escalation during the Christmas period would be inappropriate, {{as it would}} damage public morale. He also noted {{that because of the}} political instability in Saigon, the international community and the American public were unlikely to believe that the Vietcong were behind the attack, feeling that they would instead blame local infighting for the bombing. This was {{despite the fact that the}} Vietcong had already claimed responsibility. Johnson administration officials concluded four days after the bombing that the Vietcong were responsible. Johnson believed that it was too late to retaliate and that any action taken more than 36 hours after the event constituted unprovoked aggression. The State Department cabled Taylor and the embassy, saying that [...] "In view of the overall confusion in Saigon", public U.S. and international opinion towards an American air strike would be that the Johnson administration was [...] "trying to shoot its way out of an internal [...] political crisis". Johnson said to Taylor that [...] "Every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> a military recommendation it seems to me that it calls for large-scale bombing. I have never felt that this war will be won from the air." [...] At the time, Johnson was reluctant to accede to his officials' calls for large-scale bombing of North Vietnam, a strategy that eventually became policy.|$|E
