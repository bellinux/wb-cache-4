25|$|So there’s no real choice this year, {{but what}} the Occupy {{movement}} has done has taken {{us back to the}} era when Martin Luther King was in the Sixties said ‘This is unacceptable!’ We cannot have a situation where everything is owned by the 1% {{in the same way that}} Martin Luther King said in the Riverside Church that we have a government that is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today, we are exploiting the planet, and that is unacceptable. So the memory of Martin Luther King – it’s about dreams, but it’s also about the courage to draw a line right <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> ‘We cannot go on crossing this line. This is a moral line, this is a line concerning power and the world’. And there today America is on that line. And people know that what we got to – these years after Martin Luther King was murdered – is completely unacceptable, and it’s his example that will inspire us as we go forward into this year.|$|E

But you don't stand <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> 'Look, I am a pioneer'. There is a need to do something, to help go about creating something, and you do it." [...] He compiled and edited some of the first anthologies of English poetry from Singapore and Malaysia, including The Flowering Tree (1970), Seven Poets (1973) and The Second Tongue (1979). He was also the general editor of two multilingual anthologies sponsored by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Committee of Culture and Information entitled The Poetry of Singapore (1985) and The Fiction of Singapore (1990). In addition to the collections of poetry already mentioned, he has published two volumes of poetry for children called Child's Delight (1972), and another collection called Friend: Poems (2003). Still Travelling, an anthology consisting of almost 50 poems, was published in 2008.|$|E

Describing himself as [...] "an improviser by nature", every day for three weeks Shankar would leave London and head west on the M4, during which he would write the music to be run through with the musicians that day in Friar Park's grand drawing room. Harrison remarked of the process: [...] "It was amazing, because he'd sit <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> to one person, 'This is where you play,' and the next one, 'And you do this,' and 'You do that,' and they're all going, What?

His parents disapproved of the idea, Zemeckis later said, [...] "But only in the sense that they were concerned... for my [...] family and my friends and the world that I grew up in, this was the kind of dream that really was impossible.

2500|$|In May 2012, {{production}} {{returned to}} Budapest for seven weeks of additional shooting. The following month, screenwriter Damon Lindelof {{was hired to}} rewrite the film's third act with reshoots scheduled to begin in September or October 2012. However, Lindelof, who also reworked Prometheus and co-wrote Star Trek Into Darkness, {{did not have time}} to script the new ending and in July 2012, Paramount hired Lindelof's Lost partner, Drew Goddard. Lindelof explained there were inefficiencies in the script in relation to the shooting, which started before the script was finalized thus making the ending [...] "abrupt and incoherent" [...] and was missing a large chunk of footage. Lindelof presented two options to executives, who ultimately chose to shoot 30 to 40 minutes of additional footage to make a coherent ending. Goddard later told Creative Screenwriting, [...] "To me the big lesson of World War Z was that Paramount, Plan B and Brad Pitt simply said, 'Let's take the time to make this movie the best version of the movie before we put it on the screen for audience.' That doesn't happen a lot. A lot of times they just throw the movie out <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> 'We'll make all our money opening weekend and then the movie will go away.'

It's an album by the greatest rapper of his generation." [...] Producer Tony Visconti stated David Bowie's album Blackstar (2016) was influenced by Lamar's work, [...] "we were listening to a lot of Kendrick Lamar [...] we loved the fact Kendrick was so open-minded and he didn't do a straight-up hip-hop record. He threw everything on there, and that's exactly what we wanted to do." [...] Visconti also stated this about Lamar while talking about [...] "rule-breakers" [...] in music. “His album ‘To Pimp A Butterfly’ broke every rule in the book and he had a number one album glued to the top of the charts. You’d think certain labels would learn form that. But they take somebody who is out <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> ‘That’s what people want.’ No, people want that for one week. You don’t want the same song every single day of your life.”Lamar won five Grammys at the 58th ceremony, including Best Rap Album for To Pimp a Butterfly. Other nominations included Album of the Year and Song of the Year. At the ceremony, Lamar performed a medley of [...] "The Blacker the Berry" [...] and [...] "Alright".
