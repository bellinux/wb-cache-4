5|$|The 298 LT vz. 35 {{tanks were}} {{assigned}} to the armoured regiments belonging to the four Mobile (Rychlá) Divisions between 1936—39. Each regiment was supposed <b>to</b> <b>detach</b> three-tank platoons to support the infantry divisions and border areas in times of crisis. These platoons were heavily used suppressing the protests and violence instigated by Konrad Henlein's Sudeten German Party (Sudetendeutsche Partei - SdP) and the Sudetendeutsche Freikorps (paramilitary groups trained in Germany by SS-instructors) between May and October 1938.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} two shows of season two, Jim Shelley in The Guardian, called The Wire the best show on TV, praising the second season for its ability <b>to</b> <b>detach</b> from its former {{foundations}} in the first season. Jon Garelick with the Boston Phoenix was {{of the opinion that}} the subculture of the docks (second season) was not as absorbing as that of the housing projects (first season), but he went on to praise the writers for creating a realistic world and populating it with an array of interesting characters.|$|E

She eventually consents, and finally finds in the film an insightful view into historical Human-Vulcan relations. Meanwhile, Mayweather makes his intended modifications without permission, resulting in a confrontation when Paul finds out. The ship comes under further attack from an alien vessel, and Paul offers up the cargo as planned. The aliens refuse and demand the vessel as well. Left without any other option, Paul tells Mayweather to re-initiate the modifications, and <b>to</b> <b>detach</b> the command module from the cargo section. They soon disable the alien ship. The brothers reconcile, and Mayweather leaves, promising to visit again soon.|$|E

At a dig site, Grant's assistant, Billy Brennan, demonstrates how he can use a 3D printer to replicate a Velociraptor larynx.|$|E
5|$|Following her {{commissioning}} {{into the}} fleet, Emden {{was assigned to}} the East Asia Squadron. In 1913, Korvettenkapitän (Corvette Captain) Karl von Müller became the ship's commander. At the outbreak of war, Emden was the only major German warship in Tsingtao, the main German naval base in Asia. Müller immediately began to operate as a commerce raider, and captured one ship, the Russian steamer Ryazan. Emden was thereafter ordered to rendezvous with the rest of Spee's cruisers. She remained with the East Asia Squadron for only a few days, as Müller convinced Spee <b>to</b> <b>detach</b> Emden as an independent raider in the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|In 344BC Demosthenes {{travelled}} to the Peloponnese, {{in order}} <b>to</b> <b>detach</b> as many cities {{as possible from}} Macedon's influence, but his efforts were generally unsuccessful. Most of the Peloponnesians saw Philip as the guarantor of their freedom and sent a joint embassy to Athens to express their grievances against Demosthenes' activities. In response, Demosthenes delivered the Second Philippic, a vehement attack against Philip. In 343BC Demosthenes delivered On the False Embassy against Aeschines, who was facing a charge of high treason. Nonetheless, Aeschines was acquitted by the narrow margin of thirty votes by a jury which may have numbered as many as 1,501.* D. M. MacDowell, Demosthenes the Orator, ch. 12 (in fine).|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to volunteers, Jefferson also {{arranged for a}} regiment of 200 regular Continental soldiers under Colonel John Gibson to accompany Clark. Longstanding tensions between Continental Army officers and the militia made such cooperation problematic, however. Colonel Daniel Brodhead, the Continental Army commander at Fort Pitt, refused <b>to</b> <b>detach</b> men for Clark's campaign because he was staging his own expedition against the Delaware Indians, who had recently entered {{the war against the}} Americans. Brodhead marched into the Ohio Country and destroyed the Delaware Indian capital of Coshocton in April 1781. This resulted in the Delaware becoming more determined enemies, and deprived Clark of badly needed men and supplies for the Detroit campaign.|$|E
5|$|Late 1917 saw the High Seas Fleet {{beginning}} to conduct anti-convoy raids in the North Sea between Britain and Norway. In October and December 1917, two British convoys to Norway were intercepted and destroyed by German cruisers and destroyers, prompting Beatty, now the Commander in Chief of the Grand Fleet, <b>to</b> <b>detach</b> several battleships and battlecruisers to protect convoys. This presented to Admiral Scheer {{the opportunity for}} which he had been waiting the entire war: the chance to isolate and eliminate a portion of the Grand Fleet.|$|E

These units, augmented by other Panzer companies, formed four Schwimm-Panzerabteilungen (amphibious tank departments) for Operation Sea Lion, the planned and aborted invasion of the United Kingdom.

5|$|Ordinary {{smallpox}} generally {{produced a}} discrete rash, {{in which the}} pustules stood out on the skin separately. The distribution of the rash was densest on the face; denser on the extremities than on the trunk; and on the extremities, denser on the distal parts than on the proximal.

Sometimes, the blisters merged into sheets, forming a confluent rash, which began <b>to</b> <b>detach</b> the outer layers of skin from the underlying flesh. Patients with confluent smallpox often remained ill even after scabs have formed over all the lesions. In one case series, the case-fatality rate in confluent smallpox was 62 percent.|$|E

The film finally ends {{with the image of}} horses at river in the rain. To Tarkovsky horses symbolized life, and including horses in the final scene (and in many other scenes in the film) meant that life was the source of all of Rublev's art.|$|E

The Admiralty ordered Tyrwhitt <b>to</b> <b>detach</b> Carysfort and four destroyers to reinforce Vice-Admiral Reginald Bacon's Dover Patrol as they feared that the transfer was in preparation for a concerted attack on the shipping protected by the latter. Three nights later, the newly arrived German destroyers did exactly what the Admiralty feared and attacked. Carysfort played no role in the resulting action, but was kept in reserve and helped to search for damaged vessels the following morning.

Comminges' contract was initially due to expire at the end of the season but, having suffered the injury, he was offered a six-month extension by the club until January 2011 in order to regain fitness and improve his chances of finding a new club. His appearance as a 90th-minute substitute in a 3–1 away victory at Plymouth Argyle on 18 August 2009 would ultimately be his last for the club.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Raglan wished to {{reinforce}} the Turks and British infantry, and ordered Lucan <b>to</b> <b>detach</b> {{four of the five}} Heavy Brigade cavalry regiments and send them to the defensive line. This further angered Lucan, since splitting the force in half merely reduced the cavalry's overall effectiveness, but he again complied. The result was that the first fork of the Russian cavalry attack encountered The Thin Red Line and were driven off, while the second fork, crossing the heights above the plain, encountered four regiments of the Heavy Brigade. The Russians – with between 1,500 and 2,000 men – were initially surprised to see the 800 British cavalry approaching, allowing Scarlett, the commander of the Heavy Brigades, to charge the Russians uphill. By this point Lucan had left Lord Cardigan in charge of the Light Brigade and raced over to the Heavies, later claiming that his duty trumpeter had ordered the British charge, which eventually forced the Russians to flee.|$|E
