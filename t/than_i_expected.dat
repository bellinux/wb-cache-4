500|$|During season two, Perrineau stated [...] "'s nicer <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> {{him to be}}. Or, he is nicer so far <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> him to be ... I try to take {{characters}} that I think are challenging and a little complicated and hopefully really smart and thoughtful and compassionate. I think Michael is all those things. He {{seems to have a}} lot of bad luck." [...] He defends Michael's behavior in season two, saying [...] " [...] keeps stepping into more trouble than he actually asked for". Cynthia Littleton of Variety described Michael as [...] "one of the most interesting of the Oceanic 815-ers: flawed, tortured, hard to read, volatile, fighting his innate talents, his own worst enemy, at times, and at others, a totally stand-up guy." [...] IGN's Chris Carabott calls Michael a [...] "natural" [...] father. Michael is known for frequently shouting [...] "Walt!", [...] "Where's my son!" [...] and [...] "Have you seen my boy?".|$|E
500|$|Gabby West, who won {{the second}} season of Scream Queens, plays Kara in the film. [...] Chester Bennington, the lead vocalist of the {{alternative}} rock band Linkin Park, has {{a role in the}} film playing Evan, a white power skinhead. Bennington met with an acting coach to prepare for his role. He said, [...] "It was actually a little more difficult <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> because it took a lot for me {{to figure out how to}} portray this guy and what exactly his motives were going to be throughout. I thought maybe I was overthinking it, and I met with this really great acting coach who helped me walk through and make sense of the, 'Motivation' [...] ". Devon Bostick was offered to reprise his role as Brent from Saw VI, but turned it down due to scheduling conflicts.|$|E
500|$|Wollstonecraft {{left for}} Paris in December 1792 and arrived {{about a month}} before Louis XVI was guillotined. Britain and France were {{on the brink of}} war when she left for Paris, and many advised her not to go. France was in turmoil. She sought out other British {{visitors}} such as Helen Maria Williams and joined the circle of expatriates then in the city. On 26 December 1792, Wollstonecraft saw the former king, Louis XVI, being taken to be tried before the National Assembly, and much to her own surprise, found the sight of Louis riding down the streets as a prisoner in a wagon [...] "made the tears flow insensibly from my eyes, when I saw Louis sitting, with more dignity <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> from his character, in a hackney coach going to meet death, where so many of his race have triumphed". During her time in Paris, Wollstonecraft associated mostly with the moderate Girondins rather than the more radical Jacobins.|$|E

500|$|Darabont wrote a 60-page pilot {{script for}} [...] "Days Gone Bye". His initial script for the episode was split {{in half and}} embellished. Darabont {{explained}} that he did this to [...] "slow the narrative down and dig into the characters more deeply, so it's not just plot-driven, event-driven stuff. You really want to drag these characters into the equation." [...] Darabont felt that instituting visual maneuvers would increase the surreal atmosphere of a scene. Upon reading the script, Kirkman thought that producers were consistent with his comic, adding that they could possibly improve his initial work. [...] "Reading that pilot was just a revelation. It's extremely faithful. There {{are things that are}} so much like the comic, I can't really remember the nuance of what's different and what's not from the comic. He's definitely being more faithful <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected,</b> and everything that he's changing is brilliant. I couldn't be happier. I think the fans of the book are going to just love it." [...] The episode shares its name with volume one of the comic book series.|$|E
500|$|The game went gold on August 5, 2002, and was {{released}} on August 27. After the release of Icewind Dale II, Sawyer expressed dissatisfaction over the Icewind Dale series, saying that, [...] "I wasn't particularly thrilled with how my work on [...] came out..." [...] and, [...] "... managed to actually be worse than my Icewind Dale stuff." [...] In regards to Icewind Dale II he said, [...] " [...] came out better <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected,</b> but still, not exactly awe-inspiring." [...] Chris Avellone later said, [...] "Icewind Dale was a fun series, but it didn't try to set the bar for {{anything other than a}} fun romp. People may remember enjoying it, but it wasn’t trying to break any new ground or do anything revolutionary. In some respects, it was almost a step back from other games we'd done and focused more on exploration and dungeon crawls." [...] A Collector's Edition containing bonus material, such as a full-color cloth map and soundtrack CD, was also released. Icewind Dale II was the final game developed using the Infinity Engine.|$|E
500|$|In Australia, Matthew Toomey, a {{film critic}} for 612 ABC Brisbane, gave The Inbetweeners 2 a B+. He said [...] "Don’t expect a deep, {{underlying}} narrative. This {{is just a}} bunch of horny teenagers doing really dumb things. To each their own... but I was entertained. First and foremost, it shocked me– and that’s not easy given how many movies I watch. It pushes the envelope a lot further <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> and I'd highly recommend seeing the film in a packed cinema. The audience reactions would be hilarious." [...] Louise Keller of Urban Cinefile wrote a mixed review, stating that the film {{takes a long time to}} [...] "get going" [...] due to a [...] "silly establishment skit". However, she concluded that [...] "there is genuine affection with which the filmmakers portray their characters and as a consequence, the level of offence is lessened to some degree". Simon Miraudo of Quickflix gave the film three stars out of five, calling it [...] "the biggest ribbing since The Simpsons invaded [...] shores". Although opining that the film was [...] "slightly more insensitive to its female leads than previous efforts", he concluded that a scene in which faeces chase Will down a waterslide [...] "challenges Caddyshack for the mantle of 'Best Ever S*** in Water' gag".|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye," [...] said Adam, [...] "I'll come if I can. But I can't {{often say}} what I'll do beforehand, {{for the work}} often holds me longer <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect.</b> You'll stay till the end o' the week, Dinah?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "My dear," [...] he returned, [...] "when a {{young lady}} is as mild as she's game, and as game as she's mild, that's all I ask, and more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect.</b> She then becomes a queen, and that's about what you are yourself." ...|$|R
500|$|A Billboard {{magazine}} review said Phantasmagoria [...] "lives up to {{the advanced}} billing" [...] and [...] "aims to unnerve and succeeds gruesomely with bloody special effects interspliced in trusty scare-flick fashion with daubs of flesh and hints of sex". USA Today writer Joe Wilson gave it three-and-a-half stars and called it well-produced, visually appealing, frighteningly realistic and [...] "a much-needed change from normal fare", although he said the plot did not start to become interesting until halfway through. Gene Emery of The Providence Journal said the game was [...] "an impressive work, a sophisticated mix of live action and a rich computer-generated environment, coupled with a musical score that's spooky without being overwhelming". He also called the gameplay [...] "elegant in its simplicity". San Francisco Chronicle writer Laura Evenson called it unpredictable and addictive, comparing it to a good mystery novel. A reviewer for Next Generation {{was pleased with the}} story, the production values of the cutscenes, and the way the game mixed in full motion video without resulting in slowdown or poor control. However, he found that the lack of a challenge made it a poor value for experienced gamers, since {{they would be able to}} finish the entire game in a day or two, and recommended it strictly for gamers who were new to the adventure genre. Ric Manning of the Gannett News Service wrote, [...] "The graphics are terrific, but don't play on a full stomach." [...] Steve La Rue of U-T San Diego found the game [...] "visually opulent and interesting" [...] with [...] "dialogue a lot better <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected,</b> given the trite gothic novel plot", but also said he had to adjust to the [...] "gradual, contemplative pace". Jack Warner of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote: [...] "It's hackneyed, but the art is so good, the acting sufficiently convincing and the atmosphere brooding enough to keep you going", although he said [...] "precious little happens" [...] in the first few discs.|$|E
2500|$|Robinson was {{urged by}} landlords {{to remove the}} [...] "pauper and undesirables". He {{resisted}} and stated that he had [...] "no wish...to hold out a bounty to persons of bad character...but as Robinson traveled through the countryside they became flesh and blood 'people of a good sort' he called them, 'bred to farming...I found them much more intelligent <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected.</b> Most of them could read and write'".|$|E
2500|$|George A. Romero said, [...] "It {{was better}} <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected.</b> ... The first 15, 20 minutes were terrific, but {{it sort of}} lost its reason for being. It {{was more of a}} video game. I'm not terrified of things running at me; it's like Space Invaders. There was nothing going on underneath." [...] South Park parodied the film in the episode, [...] "Night of the Living Homeless". The show's creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, called the film [...] "amazing" [...] in the episode's DVD commentary.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of July, Tunney was selected {{to compete for the}} United Kingdom at the 2012 Summer Olympics, making her the youngest athlete for Team GB at London 2012. [...] After arriving in London, she said, “It’s been overwhelming, definitely, I wasn’t expecting it to be like this. I {{knew it was going to}} be big but this was more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected.</b> But I’ve got all my team-mates to settle me down and talk me through things. Being in the village has been the best bit – how big it is, and seeing other athletes, great athletes, walking around. The others have tried to calm me down.” ...|$|E
2500|$|England {{therefore}} won the two Test series 2–0, taking both matches by {{more than}} an innings. This was their fifth successive Test series win, {{and the first time}} that the English had won five successive Test series since 1971. With their first three innings all being over before the Bangladeshis made 200, the series was clearly England's, who consolidated their position at second in the ICC Test Championship table. Bangladesh remain bottom in tenth place. Afterwards England captain Michael Vaughan said, [...] "It's difficult to judge how much we've got out of these games because we've won so easily. We've not had those real tough-in sessions and fight-through sessions where we've lost a batch of wickets. We have had stages when we had to knuckle down but it has been easier <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected.</b> To win two Test matches in almost two days each is obviously quite an easy series victory." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 5, 1788, the New Jersey Legislature gave Baron von Steuben {{full title}} to the former Zabriskie estate. A month later, {{recognizing}} his financial embarrassment, Steuben wrote another former aide-de-camp and companion, William North, recognizing: [...] "The jersey Estate must and is to be sold. Walker is my administrator, all debts are to be paid out of it." [...] On November6, 1788, Steuben again wrote North (at his new home in Duanesburg), noting [...] "My Jersey Estate is Advertised but not yet Sold, from this Walker Shall immediately pay to you the money, you so generously lend me and all my debts in New-York will be payed. I support my present poverty with more heroism <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>Expected.</b> All Clubs and parties are renounced, I seldom leave the House." [...] Steuben eventually sold the New Jersey property to a son of the previous owner, and it remained in the Zabriskie family until 1909. It is the only remaining eighteenth-century building that von Steuben owned.|$|E

2500|$|Upon release, Record Mirror {{reviewed}} the album and concluded: [...] "The numbers offer {{a lot of}} variety. The most immediate thing I noticed was the arrangements - which included some solid bass work that would have done justice to Led Zeppelin. Next, there's the use of backup vocals, something Slade haven't used {{too much in the}} past. Finally, there's the pace, lots of it. It's not an album of singles - it does present tracks that are a lot deeper <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected.</b> You're right lads, you're nobody's fools!" [...] New Musical Express wrote: [...] "Well if this album is an accurate representation of their album-making ability I doubt it very much. Oh, Slade are an exciting band. Plenty of kick and grit, and their unrefined charm which has been captured from their live performances in the studio environment, but though superficially the music here is of reasonable standard, there's not a lot of depth. Really the album is just a collection of hooky little singles." [...] Music Week wrote [...] "A cracking album, the group is now playing better than ever. Slade has matured {{to the point of being}} able to convert an older audience to their cause." ...|$|E
