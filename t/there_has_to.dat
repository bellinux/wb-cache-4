25|$|Chopin {{appeared}} {{to express her}} belief in the strength of women. Marquand draws from theories about creative nonfiction {{in terms of her}} work. In order for a story to be autobiographical, or even biographical, Marquand writes, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be a nonfictional element, {{but more often than not}} the author exaggerates the truth to spark and hold interest for the readers. Kate Chopin might have been surprised to know her work has been characterized as feminist in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, just as she had been in her own time to have it described as immoral. Critics tend to regard writers as individuals with larger points of view addressed to factions in society.|$|E
25|$|However, Poincaré's {{resolution}} led to {{a paradox}} when changing frames: if a Hertzian oscillator radiates in a certain direction, it will suffer a recoil from the inertia of the fictitious fluid. Poincaré performed a Lorentz boost (to order v/c) to {{the frame of the}} moving source. He noted that energy conservation holds in both frames, but that the law of conservation of momentum is violated. This would allow perpetual motion, a notion which he abhorred. The laws of nature would have to be different in the frames of reference, and the relativity principle would not hold. Therefore, he argued that also in this case <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be another compensating mechanism in the ether.|$|E

25|$|In any {{discretised}} wavelet transform, {{there are}} only a finite number of wavelet coefficients for each bounded rectangular region in the upper halfplane. Still, each coefficient requires the evaluation of an integral. In special situations this numerical complexity can be avoided if the scaled and shifted wavelets form a multiresolution analysis. This means that <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> exist an auxiliary function, the father wavelet φ in L2(R), and that a is an integer. A typical choice is a = 2 and b = 1. The most famous pair of father and mother wavelets is the Daubechies 4-tap wavelet. Note that not every orthonormal discrete wavelet basis can be associated to a multiresolution analysis; for example, the Journe wavelet admits no multiresolution analysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{net sounder}} is an echo sounder with a {{transducer}} {{mounted on the}} headline of the net {{rather than on the}} bottom of the vessel. Nevertheless, to accommodate the distance from the transducer to the display unit, which is much greater than in a normal echo-sounder, several refinements have to be made. Two main types are available. The first is the cable type in which the signals are sent along a cable. In this case <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be the provision of a cable drum on which to haul, shoot and stow the cable during the different phases of the operation. The second type is the cable less net-sounder – such as Marport’s Trawl Explorer - in which the signals are sent acoustically between the net and hull mounted receiver/hydrophone on the vessel. In this case no cable drum is required but sophisticated electronics are needed at the transducer and receiver.|$|E
25|$|However, {{since only}} matter and {{electromagnetic}} energy are directly observable by experiment (not the non-em-fluid), Poincaré's resolution still violates the reaction principle and the COM-theorem, when an emission/absorption process is practically considered. This {{leads to a}} paradox when changing frames: if waves are radiated in a certain direction, the device will suffer a recoil from {{the momentum of the}} fictitious fluid. Then, Poincaré performed a Lorentz boost (to first order in v/c) to the frame of the moving source. He noted that energy conservation holds in both frames, but that the law of conservation of momentum is violated. This would allow perpetual motion, a notion which he abhorred. The laws of nature would have to be different in the frames of reference, and the relativity principle would not hold. Therefore, he argued that also in this case <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be another compensating mechanism in the ether.|$|E

25|$|Myiasis is {{the leading}} entomological {{evidence}} used to prove abuse, and neglect in animals. Leading causes of myiasis in animals occur {{when there is an}} injury or the presence of excretory material, making the living animal alluring to insects. The following characteristics have to be present for myiasis to happen in a pet animal. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be abuse or neglect that causes an injury with blood, decaying tissue, feces or urine that attracts flies and the animals must be fairly helpless or incapable of cleaning itself. In long-coated animals, matts and burrs can cause irritation which leads to hot spots, scratching, open lacerations, and infestation. Animals with long mats and coats are especially prone to the building of excrement around the genital area. This circumstance worsens when the animal is elderly or hindered and can no longer clean itself. Risk factors are further intensified if the animals spends most of its life outdoors and is vulnerable to the external environments. Regular grooming and check-ups can significantly reduce these risks. In addition, eliminating other fly attractants, such as uneaten food and fecal matter, can also reduce risks. The summer season is when the highest risk occurs because insects are more common during this time.|$|E

I swear to God, no one knows how lonely I get. And how empty I really feel." [...] Thereafter, Geller supplied him with books on religion and mysticism, which the singer read voraciously. Presley would be preoccupied by such matters for much of his life, taking trunkloads of books with him on tour.|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} the first conference {{prompted}} the announcement of a second ISMB conference {{at the end of}} the meeting. ISMB 1994 was initially planned to be held in Seattle. However, a competing meeting forced ISMB to change venues at short notice. The conference was held at Stanford University in August 1994 and was organised by Russ Altman, a research scientist at Stanford University School of Medicine. To emphasise the international aspect of the conference, ISMB 1995 was held at Robinson College, Cambridge. ISMB 1995 also marked a shift in the focus of the conference. ISCB Board member and Director of the Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute Alfonso Valencia has stated that, in 1995, [...] "the conference changed from a computer science-based conference to a point where everyone realized that, if you want to make progress, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be more focus in biology." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{different}} kinds of analysis are performed on ice cores, including visual layer counting, tests for electrical conductivity and physical properties, and assays for inclusion of gases, particles, radionuclides, and various molecular species. [...] For {{the results of these}} tests to be useful in the reconstruction of palaeoenvironments, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be a way to determine the relationship between depth and age of the ice. [...] The simplest approach is to count layers of ice that correspond to the original annual layers of snow, but this is not always possible. [...] An alternative is to model the ice accumulation and flow to predict how long it takes a given snowfall to reach a particular depth. [...] Another method is to correlate radionuclides or trace atmospheric gases with other timescales such as periodicities in the earth's orbital parameters.|$|E

She found all the information focused on homosexual men. [...] She recalled in a 2001 interview, [...] "I thought, this is not about me. There is nothing here about love or happiness. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be something better". Her research took up so much of her time at Northwestern that she ended up failing out of the school. Gittings found a purpose during this time, saying, [...] "My mission was not to get a general education but to find out about myself and what my life would be like. So I stopped going to classes and started going to the library. There were no organizations to turn to in those days only libraries were safe, although the information contained was dismal." ...|$|E
500|$|Ryan {{stresses}} that coaches are essentially {{supposed to be}} open and communicative with the players and management, who in turn will reciprocate the same attitude. By connecting with his associates, Ryan states, it's [...] "valuable {{when it comes to}} figuring out how to motivate somebody (...) because I want that guy to fight for me, just like I want to fight for him." [...] Fullback Tony Richardson, in an interview, stated Ryan [...] "loves his football team, loves his players" [...] and does as much as he possibly can to ensure their success. Despite his boisterous and brash comments that have caused increased media coverage of the team, Ryan has taken the attention and has managed to [...] " [...] it on himself" [...] so the players can focus on their tasks. Ryan has also stressed that the teaching process is an important one, {{particularly when it comes to}} providing a player information and building chemistry. However, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be flexibility as the process must also be insightful and positive. Ryan states that coaches are responsible for providing players with information that is vitally important otherwise [...] "if you emphasize everything, you've emphasized nothing." ...|$|E
