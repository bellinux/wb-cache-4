5|$|If the Saxbe fix is a {{solution}} for the primary problem of self-dealing, a relevant fact is <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> not voted to increase any Cabinet salary or benefits since the 1990s, when it granted that power to {{the president in the}} form of an across-the-board cost of living adjustment by executive order. However, the Ineligibility Clause does not distinguish between increases in emoluments by legislation, and increases by executive order. Perhaps the most lenient interpretation of self-dealing was made during the 1973 Saxbe hearings by Duke University School of Law professor William Van Alstyne, who argued that the ineligibility clause only applied to new offices created during a congressional term, not to appointments to existing offices.|$|E
5|$|These powers {{included}} {{the ability to}} both restrict tribal powers or to relax such restrictions. Congress has done both, {{such as in the}} withdrawal of federal recognition of the Menominee tribe with the Menominee Termination Act in 1954, and the Menominee Restoration Act to restore tribal recognition and powers. The earlier decisions in Duro, Wheeler, and Oliphant dealt with cases where Congress had restricted a tribe's inherent powers but pointed at nothing in the Constitution or established precedent that prohibits Congress from relaxing such restrictions. The decision in Duro was one of federal common law, and it is clear <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> the power to change that law. Since the power exercised by the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe was that of inherent tribal sovereignty, double jeopardy did not attach.|$|E

50|$|Justice Goldberg, in {{a lengthy}} dissent, agreed with the Court <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>had</b> the {{constitutional}} power to impose area restrictions on travel, consistent with constitutional guarantees, but rejected the Court's holding <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>had</b> exercised this power.

50|$|In 1871, the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} the 1870 statute was unconstitutional and <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>had</b> {{exceeded}} its power by invading {{the province of the}} judicial branch by prescribing the rule of decision in a particular cause. The Court also ruled <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>had</b> impermissibly infringed the power of the executive branch by limiting the effect of a Presidential pardon.|$|R

25|$|Statutory arguments, though related to, are {{distinguished}} from constitutional, administrative and general conspiracy arguments.

25|$|The idea <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> {{authority}} {{separate and}} distinct from powers granted by enumeration was (and still is) controversial.

25|$|In Slattery (Meritor Savings) v. U.S., {{after losing}} before {{a three-judge panel}} of the Federal Circuit, the {{government}} petitioned for a rehearing en banc. The court has agreed to review whether the trial court had the appropriate jurisdiction to hear the breach of contract dispute. The government is further arguing that the FDIC is Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI), an agency created by the executive branch that receives no funding, and will not receive any funding, from the government. The FDIC receives funding by charging banks fees to member banks. If the en banc court agrees and finds that appropriated funds {{may not be used}} to pay judgments against NAFI's, then any judgment in the Meritor Savings case will be produced by the banks regulated by the FDIC and not by Treasury dollars. In other words, the FDIC could be found to be in breach, but it would be entitled to recover the judgment by member banks. In order to find the FDIC a NAFI, the government is arguing <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> no obligation to honor its promises to back deposits with the full faith and credit of the United States.|$|E
500|$|Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a {{concurring opinion}} stating {{that it was}} time to re-examine the entire concept of tribal sovereignty. He noted that {{doubtful}} precedents stated that Congress, and not another part of the government had the power to regulate everything that a tribe could or could not do, which renders tribal sovereignty a [...] "nullity." [...] Thomas did not believe <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> the constitutional authority to set the [...] "metes and bounds of tribal sovereignty." [...] He noted that such authority was not in the Indian Treaty Clause nor the Indian Commerce Clause.|$|E
500|$|This rule is {{not simply}} a method of {{breaking}} ties; it reflects an altogether proper reluctance by the judiciary to assume <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> chosen further to disadvantage a people whom our Nation long ago reduced to a state of dependency. The rule is particularly appropriate when the statute in question was passed primarily {{for the benefit of the}} Indians, as was the 1959 Division of Assets Act. [...] Absent “clear and plain” language to the contrary, it must be assumed that Congress did not intend to belie its “avowed solicitude” for the Indians with a “backhanded” abrogation or limitation of their rights.|$|E
5000|$|The {{presence}} of these three conditions meant <b>that</b> <b>congress</b> <b>had</b> chosen to [...] "occupy the field" [...] and thus the states could not regulate within it.|$|R
50|$|Willis Van Devanter {{argued the}} case for the United States, taking the {{position}} <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>had</b> the power to abrogate the treaty at will. Devanter cited Kagama as authority for <b>Congress</b> <b>having</b> plenary power over Indian matters.|$|R
50|$|Another {{significant}} {{outcome was}} the Supreme Court's ruling in McGrain v. Daugherty (1927) which, {{for the first}} time, explicitly established <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>had</b> the power to compel testimony.|$|R
500|$|The United States was {{represented}} by Mark R. Freeman, Assistant to the Solicitor General. [...] Freeman argued that Congress had placed a cap on IDEAA contract funds beginning in 1994, and the BIA {{did not have the}} authority to spend more than the capped amount on all of the IDEAA contracts. [...] Due to the lack of sufficient funding, the Secretary of the Interior has distributed the available funds on a pro rata basis among all of the IDEAA contracts. [...] The United States also pointed out that the Constitution prohibits payments unless those payments have been appropriated or authorized by Congress. [...] Freeman argued that the government's liability does not extend past the amount of money <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> appropriated for all of the contracts. [...] The government also stated that the contract did not create a binding promise to pay the tribes the full amount of the contract.|$|E
500|$|Despite the Mayo Foundation's {{arguments}} otherwise, the Court {{ruled that}} [...] "student" [...] was a sufficiently ambiguous term to state <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> specifically addressed the issue. The Court {{also noted that}} Congress in the past had specifically singled out medical residents when making exemptions available, which in the Court's eyes made the Mayo Foundation's arguments about unambiguity unreasonable. Therefore, according to Chevron, {{the role of the}} courts should solely be to determine whether the Treasury Department made a reasonable decision—and the Court concluded that the Treasury did just that. In writing for the Court, Roberts stated that [...] "The [...] department certainly did not act irrationally in concluding that these doctors – 'who work long hours, serve as high [...] skilled professionals, and typically share {{some or all of the}} terms of employment of career employees' – are the kind of workers that Congress intended to both contribute and benefit from the Social Security system".|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} of these cases, Socialist Party of America {{official}} Charles Schenck had been convicted under the Espionage Act for publishing leaflets urging resistance to the draft. Schenck appealed, arguing that the Espionage Act violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. In Schenck v. United States, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected Schenck's appeal and affirmed his conviction. This conviction continued to be debated over whether Schenck went against the right to freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., writing for the Court, explained that [...] "the question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> a right to prevent." [...] One week later, in Frohwerk v. United States, the court again upheld an Espionage Act conviction, this time that of a journalist who had criticized U.S. involvement in foreign wars.|$|E

500|$|Throughout 1969 and 1970, Cooper and Senator Frank Church co-sponsored the Cooper–Church Amendments, {{aimed at}} curbing further {{escalation}} of the Vietnam War. Congressional approval {{of one of these}} amendments on December 15, 1969, de-funded the use of U.S. troops in Laos and Thailand. Cooper had wanted to include a restriction on forces entering Cambodia as well, but Mike Mansfield, who helped Cooper write the amendment, feared that Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who was officially neutral in the conflict, might be offended. When Sihanouk was deposed in 1970, Cambodia's new leader, Lon Nol, appealed to President Nixon for help in stabilizing his rule. Nixon agreed to send troops to Cambodia, despite protests from Cooper and others that this violated his stated goal of de-escalation in the region. Cooper and Church then drafted another amendment to de-fund U.S. operations in Cambodia; after negotiations with Nixon that continued funding until July 1970 so that the troops already in the country could be evacuated, the amendment passed 58–37. The House of Representatives later stripped the amendment from the legislation to which it was attached, and it did not go into effect. The amendment was nevertheless hailed by The Washington Post as [...] "the first time in our history <b>that</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> attempted to limit the deployment of American troops in the course of an ongoing war." [...] The fight over the Cooper–Church Amendments took its toll on Cooper's health, and he was briefly hospitalized to regain his strength. In 1971, Church, Mansfield, and George Aiken convinced Cooper to help them write an amendment to end U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia altogether, but ultimately, the measure did not have the support to pass and was abandoned.|$|E
