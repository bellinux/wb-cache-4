40|$|Reliable {{detection}} of error from electroencephalography (EEG) signals as feedback while performing a discrete target selection task across sessions and subjects {{has a huge}} scope in real-time rehabilitative application of Brain-computer Interfacing (BCI). Error Related Potentials (ErrP) are EEG signals which occur when the participant observes an erroneous feedback from the system. ErrP holds significance in such closed-loop system, as BCI is prone to error and we need an effective method of systematic error detection as feedback for correction. In this paper, we have proposed a novel scheme for online {{detection of}} error feedback directly from the EEG signal in a transferable environment (i. e., across sessions and across subjects). For this purpose, {{we have used a}} P 300 -speller dataset available on a BCI competition website. The task involves the subject <b>to</b> <b>select</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> of a word which is followed by a feedback period. The feedback period displays the letter selected and, if the selection is wrong, the subject perceives it by the generation of ErrP signal. Our proposed system is designed to detect ErrP present in the EEG from new independent datasets, not involved in its training. Thus, the decoder is trained using EEG features of 16 subjects for single-trial classification and tested on 10 independent subjects. The decoder designed for this task is an ensemble of linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, and logistic regression classifier. The performance of the decoder is evaluated using accuracy, F 1 -score, and Area Under the Curve metric and the results obtained is 73. 97, 83. 53, and 73. 18 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} first step towards a brain {{computer}} interface (BCI) for communication using real-time {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI). The subject in the MR scanner sees a virtual keyboard and steers a cursor to select different letters that can be combined to create words. The cursor is moved to the left by activating the left hand, to the right by activating the right hand, down by activating the left toes and up by activating the right toes. <b>To</b> <b>select</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter,</b> the subject simply rests for a number of seconds. We can thus communicate with the subject in the scanner by for example showing questions that the subject can answer. Similar BCI for communication have been made with electroencephalography (EEG). The subject then focuses on a letter while different rows and columns of the virtual keyboard are flashing and the system tries to detect if the correct letter is flashing or not. In our setup we instead classify the brain activity. Our system is neither limited to a communication interface, but can be used for any interface where five degrees of freedom is necessary. © 2010 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

40|$|Abstract Background A novel {{artefact}} removal {{algorithm is}} proposed for a self-paced hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) system. This hybrid system combines a self-paced BCI with an eye-tracker to operate a virtual keyboard. <b>To</b> <b>select</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter,</b> the user must gaze at the target {{for at least a}} specific period of time (dwell time) and then activate the BCI by performing a mental task. Unfortunately, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are often contaminated with artefacts. Artefacts change the quality of EEG signals and subsequently degrade the BCI’s performance. Methods To remove artefacts in EEG signals, the proposed algorithm uses the stationary wavelet transform combined with a new adaptive thresholding mechanism. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and other artefact handling/removal methods, semi-simulated EEG signals (i. e., real EEG signals mixed with simulated artefacts) and real EEG signals obtained from seven participants are used. For real EEG signals, the hybrid BCI system’s performance is evaluated in an online-like manner, i. e., using the continuous data from the last session as in a real-time environment. Results With semi-simulated EEG signals, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves lower signal distortion in both time and frequency domains. With real EEG signals, we demonstrate that for dwell time of 0. 0 s, the number of false-positives/minute is 2 and the true positive rate (TPR) achieved by the proposed algorithm is 44. 7 %, which is more than 15. 0 % higher compared to other state-of-the-art artefact handling methods. As dwell time increases to 1. 0 s, the TPR increases to 73. 1 %. Conclusions The proposed artefact removal algorithm greatly improves the BCI’s performance. It also has the following advantages: a) it does not require additional electrooculogram/electromyogram channels, long data segments or a large number of EEG channels, b) it allows real-time processing, and c) it reduces signal distortion. </p...|$|E

In this paper, we present a prototype that provides both pictographic and alphabetic options to allow communication. Our system was originally designed for people that suffer physical disabilities and are not able to move their body. To allow interaction we provide an eye gazed based interaction. Our system was evaluated with an experienced test subject, because the system requires training to be used.
