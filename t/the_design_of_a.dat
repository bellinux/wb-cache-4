40|$|Video {{technology}} has become <b>a</b> major aspect <b>of</b> athletic events, {{and it should}} be incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> arena. Most arenas do not provide space for television cameras at locations which are capable <b>of</b> producing <b>a</b> desireable picture for the audience at home. As a result, platforms have to be constructed or some seating has to be removed in order to place the cameras at favorable locations. I feel that this problem could be avoided if video technology was incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> arena. Since television networks pay large sums of money in order to acquire the right to broadcast athletic events, then the most up to date technology concerning audiovisual communication should be incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> arena. <b>The</b> use of video {{technology has}} proven to be effective in other aspects besides television entertainment.

5|$|Approaches to {{the design}} of {{genome-wide}} RNAi libraries can require more sophistication than <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single siRNA for a defined set of experimental conditions. Artificial neural networks are frequently used to design siRNA libraries and to predict their likely efficiency at gene knockdown. Mass genomic screening is widely seen as a promising method for genome annotation and has triggered the development of high-throughput screening methods based on microarrays. However, the utility of these screens and the ability of techniques developed on model organisms to generalize to even closely related species has been questioned, for example from C. elegans to related parasitic nematodes.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{experience}} gained from the Mark 1, the developers concluded that computers would be used more in scientific roles than pure maths.

The resulting machine, which ran its first program in May 1954, was known as Meg, or the megacycle machine. It was smaller and simpler than the Mark 1, as well as quicker at solving maths problems. Ferranti produced a commercial version marketed as the Ferranti Mercury, in which the Williams tubes were replaced by the more reliable core memory.|$|E
