Specific objectives for the cruise included: a) the recovery of two current meter moorings from Seine Seamount (originally deployed from FS Poseidon in March 2004); b) to make underway observations of upper water column currents and zooplankton migrations (using ADCPs and 10 kHz echosounder); c) to assess water column hydrography, primary production and biogeochemistry through deployments of a CTD and water bottle rosette; d) to assess the biochemistry and biogeochemistry of suspended particulate matter {{by the use of}} SAPS (stand alone pumping system); e) to investigate the taxonomy, ecology and biogeochemistry of zooplankton communities using a multiple opening and closing net system (MOCNESS); f) to make photographic (stills and video) observations of the seabed and its larger fauna (megabenthos) using the SOC SHRIMP system (Seabed High Resolution Imaging Platform); and g) to carry out a suite of seabed sampling (coring, dredging and trawling) to investigate the taxonomy, ecology and biogeochemistry of seabed communities. The latter objective was immediately precluded by the unavailability of either the coring or <b>trawl</b> <b>winches</b> for the duration of this cruise.

40|$|Aiming {{to improve}} the fishing {{efficiency}} of antarctic krill processing ships by averting the potential crushing of krill in the trawl to meet quality requirements, a twin-truss system design is proposed which has higher efficiency compared with the traditional system installed in ships.

It can also prevent the truss structure from breaking down, enabling the efficiency of trawling and horizontal locating cables during fishing operations.

40|$|Since 1988, a {{stratified}} random summer {{bottom trawl}} survey in Flemish Cap (NAFO Regulatory Area of Div. 3 M) {{was conducted by}} UE. Since 2003 the trawl vessel was replaced, the new vessel was calibrated and the indexes transformed. The lack of time has no permitted to transform the biomass and abundance shrimp indexes of the whole time series. So, the indexes in the series from 1988 to 2002 have not been changed by now and only the 2003 and 2004 indexes from the R/V Vizconde de Eza have been transformed to the R/V Cornide de Saavedra scale, to make them comparable to the results obtained in previous years. The shrimp catches taken with the same gear type Lofoten by both vessels from comparative fishing trials were very different, not only in weight but also in number. These results were interpreted on main differences between both vessels: <b>trawl</b> <b>winch</b> with an automatic control of the warp tension, higher vertical opening in the net and trawl warp length longer in the new vessel. Also, in the catches of the new vessel the presence of young shrimps was {{higher than in the}} old one. Because of this, abundance and biomass indexes from 2003 and 2004 were transformed using two methods based in conversion of CPUE and length frequencies and comparing the resulting estimates between them. Although there was not severe differences between these two methods, the marked differences in the length distribution of the catches makes the catch rate strongly dependent of the fish length (Warren, 1997), and thus we think the length conversion method reflects better the differences between the vessels. About the situation of the stock, a significan decreasing shrimp abundance and biomass is observed {{in the last two years}} (2003 - 2004), probably due to declining of 3 and 5 age-classes. Also, the strong presence of the youngest model groups (age 1 and 2) in the catches predicts good recruitment in next years...|$|E

While trawling, Reuben Lasker uses wireless and hard-wired systems to monitor the shape of the trawl net and to work in conjunction with an autotrawl system that sets trawl depth and trawl wire tension and adjusts the net configuration.|$|R
40|$|Three {{aspects of}} a survey bottom trawl performance— 1) trawl {{geometry}} (i. e., net spread, door spread, and headrope height); 2) footrope distance off-bottom; and 3) bridle distance off-bottom—were compared among hauls by using either of two autotrawl systems (equal tension and net symmetry) and hauls conducted with towing cables of equal length and locked winches. The effects of environmental conditions, vessel heave, crabbing (i. e., the difference between vessel heading and actual vessel course over ground), and bottom current on trawl performance with three trawling modes were investigated. Means {{and standard deviations of}} trawl geometry measures were not significantly different between autotrawl and locked-winch systems. Bottom trawls performed better with either autotrawl system as compared to <b>trawling</b> with locked <b>winches</b> by reducing the variance and increasing the symmetry of the footrope contact with the bottom. The equal tension autotrawl system was most effective in counteracting effects of environmental conditions on footrope bottom contact. Footrope bottom contact was most inf luenced by environmental conditions during tows with locked winches. Both of the autotrawl systems also reduced the variance and increased the symmetry of bridle bottom contact. Autotrawl systems proved to be effective in decreasing the effects of environmental factors on some aspects of trawl performance and, as a result, have the potential to reduce among-haul variance in catchability of survey trawls. Therefore, by incorporating an autotrawl system into standard survey procedures, precision of survey estimates of relative abundanc...|$|R
