Fauré admired the music of Wagner and was familiar with the smallest details of his scores, but he was one of the few composers of his generation not <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> Wagner's musical influence.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, matter {{itself is}} {{expected}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> {{the influence of}} radioactive decay, as even the most stable materials break apart into subatomic particles. Current {{data suggest that the}} universe has a flat geometry (or very close to flat), and thus, will not collapse in on itself after a finite time, and the infinite future allows for the occurrence of a number of massively improbable events, such as the formation of Boltzmann brains.|$|E

5|$|In late April, {{leading a}} fleet of seven ships and over 700, Phips sailed from Boston to the Acadian capital, Port Royal. On May 9 he summoned {{governor}} Louis-Alexandre des Friches de Meneval to surrender. Meneval, in command of about 70 men and a fort in disrepair, promptly negotiated terms of capitulation. When Phips came ashore the next day, {{it was discovered that}} Acadians had been removing valuables, including some that were government property (and thus were supposed <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> the victor's control).|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} {{eleventh}} century {{the church in}} Wales began <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> Norman influence, but Llanbadarn Fawr still essentially belonged to a Welsh world, that of an early Welsh clas, with its hereditary succession to the abbacy and its married clerics. The Church in Wales only gradually came {{under the influence of}} the see of Canterbury (and so of Rome) and even more slowly under its control. Wider political events however were to accelerate this.|$|E
5|$|Under Egyptian control Deir al-Balah, whose {{population}} tripled {{through the}} influx of refugees from the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, was a prosperous agricultural town until its capture by Israel in the Six-Day War. After 27 years of Israeli occupation, Deir al-Balah became the first city <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> Palestinian self-rule in 1994. Since {{the outbreak of the}} Second Intifada in 2000, it has witnessed frequent incursions by the Israeli Army with the stated aim of stopping Qassam rocket fire into Israel.

5|$|After Martin's death, the 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry {{began to}} buckle as {{increasing}} numbers of North Korean troops flooded into Chonan from the Northwest and eastern roads. The battalion suffered heavy casualties, but was saved by the continuous fire laid down by the 63rd Field Artillery Battalion. Between 0800 and 1000, U.S. units began a disorganized retreat from the town, many soldiers deserting their units and running from the battle. Wadlington, now {{in command of the}} 34th Infantry, moved 3rd Battalion to a collecting point south of the town, where 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry was holding a blocking position and had not been engaged. As 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry began to pull back to rally points, 1st Battalion began <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> mortar fire from North Korean forces, but withdrew without engaging them.|$|E
5|$|At that time, {{the only}} Finnish heavy vehicle {{producer}} Oy Suomen Autoteollisuus Ab (SAT) {{was building a}} new factory in Karis, a location considered less likely than Helsinki <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> attack from Soviet air raids. Company general director Tor Nessling suggested the factory should be larger than originally planned. As another option, Nessling, with extreme reservation, considered building a new factory elsewhere in Finland. SAT was experienced in heavy vehicle production but economic and technical resources were limited. Heavy vehicle importers and some political cliques thought SAT was trying {{to benefit from the}} war and to gain a dominant position in the Finnish market.|$|E
5|$|Colonel England's 2/3rd Infantry Battalion was {{supported}} by the guns of the 104th Regiment Royal Horse Artillery and a troop of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment. The tanks were late in arriving, and England postponed his attack to 1030. The battalion came under artillery fire, mostly from a battery north of Bardia that was then engaged and silenced by the 104th Regiment Royal Horse Artillery. The advance resumed, only <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> machine gun and artillery fire from Wadi el Gerfan. An eight-man section under Lance Corporal F. W. Squires was sent to reconnoitre the wadi but attacked a battery position instead and returned with 500 prisoners. The wadi was found to contain large numbers of Italian soldiers from technical units who, untrained for combat, surrendered in large numbers. One company captured over 2,000 prisoners, including 60 officers.|$|E

5|$|During mid-July the USAAF {{strategic}} bomber {{forces in the}} Pacific were reorganized. On 16July, XXIBomber Command was re-designated the Twentieth Air Force and LeMay appointed its commander. Two days later the United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific (USASTAF) was established at Guam {{under the command of}} General Carl Spaatz. USASTAF's role was to command the Twentieth Air Force as well as the Eighth Air Force, which at the time was moving from Europe to Okinawa. The Eighth Air Force was led by James Doolittle (who had been promoted to general) and was being reequipped with B-29s. The Commonwealth Tiger Force, which was to include Australian, British, Canadian and New Zealand heavy bomber squadrons and attack Japan from Okinawa, was also <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> the command of USASTAF when it arrived in the region during late 1945.|$|E
5|$|In 1150, {{it looked}} like Caithness and the whole earldom of Orkney were going <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> {{permanent}} Scottish control. However, David's plans for the north soon began to encounter problems. In 1151, King Eystein II of Norway put a spanner in the works by sailing through the waterways of Orkney with a large fleet and catching the young Harald unaware in his residence at Thurso. Eystein forced Harald to pay fealty {{as a condition of}} his release. Later in the year David hastily responded by supporting the claims to the Orkney earldom of Harald's rival Erlend Haraldsson, granting him half of Caithness in opposition to Harald. King Eystein responded in turn by making a similar grant to this same Erlend, cancelling the effect of David's grant. David's weakness in Orkney was that the Norwegian kings were not prepared to stand back and let him reduce their power.|$|E
5|$|In 1285, {{increasing}} Tatar {{pressure from}} the northeast had forced the Second Bulgarian Empire <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> the political dependence of Nogai Khan, the ruler of the Golden Horde. At the time Shishman's realm centred at Vidin was largely independent from the Bulgarian tsars in Tarnovo, though he retained a degree of loyalty to Bulgaria and maintained friendly relations with Serbia. However, in 1291 Shishman too was forced to acknowledge the suzerainty of Nogai in order to counter the increasing Serbian {{pressure from the}} west. In the same year, the joint forces of Hungarian vassal Stephen Dragutin and Serbian king Stephen Milutin (r. 1280–1321) had managed to oust two Cuman–Bulgarian nobles and allies of Shishman, Darman and Kudelin, who were {{in control of the}} Braničevo region.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Yi {{was listed}} as being born in 1984 during the Four Nation Tournament, but Chinese {{officials}} {{said that it was}} probably a typographical error. Two years later, Fran Blinebury of The Houston Chronicle reported that Yi told Shane Battier he was 24 years old in an exhibition game before the 2006 FIBA World Championship, but the story was refuted by both Yi and Battier. Yi is not the first Chinese basketball player <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> scrutiny for age discrepancy, as former NBA player Wang Zhizhi had been listed as being born in both 1977 and 1979. In 2006, a senior Chinese official admitted that past youth squads had included players above the permitted age.|$|E
5|$|Senate {{and house}} legislators who had favored Benton's renegotiated {{version of the}} Texas {{annexation}} bill had been assured that President Tyler would sign the joint house measure, but leave its implementation to the incoming Polk administration. But, during his last day in office, President Tyler, with the urging of his Secretary of State Calhoun, decided to act decisively to improve the odds for the immediate annexation of Texas. On March 3, 1845, with his cabinet's assent, he dispatched an offer of annexation to the Republic of Texas by courier, exclusively {{under the terms of}} the Brown–Foster option of the joint house measure. Secretary Calhoun apprised President-elect Polk of the action, who demurred without comment. Tyler justified his preemptive move on the grounds that Polk was likely <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> pressure to abandon immediate annexation and reopen negotiations under the Benton alternative.|$|E

5|$|The first French units <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> attack {{were those}} {{officers}} accompanying the local gendarmerie or standing guard. The contingents of the French garrison at Marash, numbering only 2,000 men, were separated {{from one another}} in the citywide siege. Direct communications did not exist between Marash and division headquarters and General Dufieux was only informed of the insurrection on 31 January, after several Armenians from the French Armenian Legion managed to disguise themselves as Muslims and cross the battle lines. He immediately appointed Lieutenant Colonel Robert Normand to lead a relief expedition, composed of three infantry battalions and half a squadron of cavalry, to Marash, and dispatched aerial recon flights, giving hope to the besieged French, Armenians and American relief workers who were assisting the local population.|$|E
5|$|The stadium hosted Olympics in 1870 and 1875. Thirty {{thousand}} spectators attended that Games in 1870, {{though no}} official attendance records {{are available for}} the 1875 Games. In 1890, after attending the Olympian Games of the Wenlock Olympian Society, Baron Pierre de Coubertin was inspired to found the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Coubertin built on the ideas and work of Brookes and Zappas {{with the aim of}} establishing internationally rotating Olympic Games that would occur every four years. He presented these ideas during the first Olympic Congress of the newly created International Olympic Committee. This meeting was held from 16 to 23 June 1894, at the University of Paris. On {{the last day of the}} Congress, it was decided that the first Olympic Games <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> the auspices of the IOC would take place in Athens in 1896.

5|$|After the Marianas began <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> attack, the United States {{military}} {{stepped up}} its raids on the Japanese-held islands {{which could be used}} to launch raids on the B-29 bases. Particular attention was given to Iwo Jima, as it was correctly assumed that the Japanese aircraft which attacked the Marianas were flying from Japan and staging through the island en route to their targets. Following the first raid against Saipan in November, XXI Bomber Command B-29s were dispatched against Iwo Jima's airfields on November5 and 8. These attacks were primarily training missions and caused little damage. The first raid was unopposed by the Japanese, but the second was met by eight fighters which inflicted light damage on a B-29; this was the first combat damage suffered by any of XXI Bomber Command's aircraft. The Seventh Air Force also increased the number of B-24 Liberator attacks on Iwo Jima, and these attacked the island 30 times during November.|$|E
