A harbor pilot guided the ship through the Valdez Narrows before departing the ship and returning control to Hazelwood, the ship's master. The ship maneuvered out of the outbound traffic lane in the <b>Traffic</b> <b>Separation</b> Scheme (TSS) to avoid icebergs.

These simulation studies suggest that communication failure can cause the performance of these separation management algorithms to degrade significantly.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research described in this paper was to produce {{a model for the}} analysis of terminal airspace capacity and the sensitivity of this capacity to the parameters which influence it. The model developed is based onthe concept of an expected ultimate capacity and applies to arriving traffic under saturation conditions i. e. a constant demand for service. It is possible to use the model for planning and operational purposes: for the computation of terminal airspace capacity, the separation of aircraft at the terminal entry gates so as to provide maximum capacity, and for heuristic optimization of arriving aircraft trajectories through the terminal airspace. For a sensitivity analysis the model allows for changes in terminal airspace geometry, runway(s) in use, arriving aircraft trajectories, arriving traffic distribution between the terminal airspace entry gates, aircraft type mix, aircraft velocities and air <b>traffic</b> control <b>separation</b> rules...|$|R
5000|$|In air <b>traffic</b> control, <b>separation</b> is {{the name}} for the concept of keeping an {{aircraft}} outside a minimum distance from another aircraft {{to reduce the risk}} of those aircraft colliding, as well as prevent accidents due to secondary factors, such as wake turbulence. Separation can also apply to terrain, obstacles, and controlled airspace, wherein an aircraft must stay at a minimum distance from a block of airspace; as an example, all aircraft must be approved by the controller who [...] "owns" [...] the airspace before the aircraft is approved to enter that sector. Air traffic controllers apply rules, known as separation minima to do this. Pairs of aircraft to which these rules have been successfully applied are said to be separated: the risk of these aircraft colliding is therefore remote. If separation is lost between two aircraft, they are said to be in a conflict.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{ability to}} {{specifically}} label proteins within living cells can {{provide information about}} their dynamics and function. To study a membrane protein, we fused a multi-functional reporter protein, HaloTag ®, to the extracellular domain of a truncated integrin. Results Using the HaloTag technology, we could study the localization, trafficking and processing of an integrin-HaloTag fusion, which we showed had cellular dynamics consistent with native integrins. By labeling live cells with different fluorescent impermeable and permeable ligands, we showed spatial separation of plasma membrane and internal pools of the integrin-HaloTag fusion, and followed these protein pools over time to study bi-directional trafficking. In addition to combining the HaloTag reporter protein with different fluorophores, we also employed an affinity tag to achieve cell capture. Conclusion The HaloTag technology was used successfully to study expression, <b>trafficking,</b> spatial <b>separation</b> and real-time translocation of an integrin-HaloTag fusion, thereby demonstrating that this technology {{can be a powerful}} tool to investigate membrane protein biology in live cells. </p...|$|R

40|$|When {{using the}} Instrument Landing System (ILS) all {{aircraft}} must follow {{a straight line}} approach path before landing. The Microwave Landing System (MLS) will allow use of differing curved approach paths. The objective {{of this research is}} to find out whether the introduction of MLS and consequently multiple approach paths can bring an increase in runway landing capacity. A model is developed which is capable of computing the expected ultimate landing runway capacity, under ILS and MLS conditions, when aircraft population characteristics and Air <b>Traffic</b> Control <b>separation</b> rules are given. This model can be applied in situations when only a horizontal separation between aircraft approaching a runway is allowed, as well as when both vertical and horizontal separations are possible. Results suggest that an increase in runway landing capacity, caused by introducing the MLS-described multiple approach paths, is to be expected only when an aircraft population consists of aircraft with significantly differing approach velocities and particularly in situations when a vertical separation can be applied...|$|R
40|$|The {{formalization}} {{and analysis}} of an air <b>traffic</b> control <b>separation</b> minima serves in this paper as an illustration of an approach that uses formal operational semantics to drive the automated analysis of specifications. This contrasts with the approach of translating one notation into the input format for an analysis tool, or hard-coding the semantics of a particular notation into the implementation of an analysis technique. The semantic functions capture {{the structure of the}} specification and can be directly evaluated to map a notation to a rigourous mathematical foundation. This work contributes to a greater appreciation of how the structure of a specification (e. g., the organization of a table), not just the semantics, is an important input to many analysis functions. Building upon a common mathematical foundation, different notations can be combined to support an integrated approach to the analysis of a formal specification.
