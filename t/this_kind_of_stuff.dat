500|$|When it {{came time}} to record a lead single, Yankovic once again turned his {{attention}} to Michael Jackson. Jackson had just released his album Bad, a follow-up to 1983's immensely successful album Thriller. After Yankovic first heard the lead single, [...] "Bad", he immediately envisioned a parody entitled [...] "Fat". Initially, Yankovic didn't want to record another Michael Jackson parody. He later said, [...] "I was still primarily known as the 'Eat It' guy and I didn't want to become known as the guy who just rides Michael's coattails." [...] He later relented and sought out Jackson for permission. Jackson, a fan of Yankovic's work, had already let Yankovic parody his 1983 hit single [...] "Beat It". When presented with the new potential parody, Jackson not only approved it, but let Yankovic use his own Moonwalker subway set for the music video. Yankovic later presented Jackson with a gold record of Even Worse after the album sold over 500,000 copies. Jackson was so pleased with the song and video, he ordered twelve copies to give to his friends. [...] Yankovic later said, [...] "He doesn't have to let me do <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> [...] The only reason he would let me is because he has a great sense of humor." ...|$|E

500|$|Lord {{had been}} the main writer {{on the first two}} albums and his {{classical}} music upbringing and interest in fusing classical and rock had profoundly influenced the direction taken by the band. Blackmore compared the organ-heavy mix of those releases to the works of the British progressive rock band The Nice, featuring Keith Emerson on keyboards. On Deep Purple Lord still had a great influence, which found maximum expression in the harpsicord-flavoured [...] "Blind" [...] and in the orchestral section of [...] "April", an original piece for choir and string quartet that he composed despite being hard at work in writing and arranging his Concerto for Group and Orchestra. Lord's dominance was balanced in this release by the space as writer and performer achieved by Blackmore, who delivered his longest and, for some critics, best guitar solos to date. Critics also remark Paice's progress as performer especially on the [...] "tribal" [...] opening track [...] "Chasing Shadows", where he had his first chance at songwriting.

Of the group's second EP, Feral, Jersey Beat wrote, [...] "Sloppy lo-fi bedroom recordings never sounded so good before" [...] and further praised [...] "the socially fitting and heartfelt lyrics, sung with emotion and angst." [...] Razorcake's similarly enthusiastic review of the band's split EP with Turkish Techno described Troublemake as [...] "a solid anathematic band, hailing from D.C., but making sounds in the Dillinger Four universe. This feels more produced than earlier songs—but with the strong, eager oomph they've always had—driving the songs with a spirit {{you can get on}} board with. <b>This</b> is the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> that makes house parties pop, getting everyone to sing and scream together." [...] Much more of a project than an active band, Troublemake's only activity was recording sporadically in the years 2005, 2006, and 2008, and several shows in support of Rational Anthem during that band's tour in the summer of 2008.|$|R

5000|$|By late 1969, Mike Curb {{had become}} {{president}} of MGM Records, and appointed Lloyd, then aged 20, as vice-president in charge of A&R. Among the artists Lloyd signed to the label was Lou Rawls, whose 1971 hit single and album, A Natural Man, he produced. As Curb purged the label of artists associated with drug use, Lloyd moved into more mainstream pop music, initially as the producer of several of The Osmonds' hits, including [...] "Down by the Lazy River" [...] and [...] "Crazy Horses" [...] in 1972. He also wrote and produced tracks on Donny Osmond's solo album Portrait of Donny, as well as later singles and albums by Donny and Marie, The Osmonds, and Engelbert Humperdinck. [...] Lloyd later said:"A publisher had a song he wanted Lou Rawls to sing. I could sign acts at MGM. Lou had been dropped by Capitol Records already and his career was over. But this publisher was really bright. He figured {{if he could get}} somebody to sign Lou Rawls, then Lou Rawls would have a deal and he could cut his song. So he hammered me and he hammered me to do this. Finally I said yes, and that record won a Grammy and all <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> crazy <b>stuff.</b> And then—and here's where the other opportunity comes along—I had been resistant.

60|$|The {{second of}} the two points on which I think Shaw has done {{definite}} harm is this: that he has (not always or even as a rule intentionally) increased that anarchy of thought which is always the destruction of thought. Much of his early writing has encouraged among the modern youth that most pestilent of all popular tricks and fallacies; {{what is called the}} argument of progress. I mean this kind of thing. Previous ages were often, alas, aristocratic in politics or clericalist in religion; but they were always democratic in philosophy; they appealed to man, not to particular men. And if most men were against an idea, that was so far against it. But nowadays that most men are against a thing is thought to be in its favour; it is vaguely supposed to show that some day most men will be for it. If a man says that cows are reptiles, or that Bacon wrote Shakespeare, he can always quote the contempt of his contemporaries as in some mysterious way proving the complete conversion of posterity. The objections to this theory scarcely need any elaborate indication. The final objection to it is that it amounts to this: say anything, however idiotic, and you are in advance of your age. <b>This</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> must be stopped. The sort of democrat who appeals to the babe unborn must be classed with the sort of aristocrat who appeals to his deceased great-grandfather. Both should be sharply reminded that they are appealing to individuals whom they well know to be at a disadvantage in the matter of prompt and witty reply. Now although Bernard Shaw has survived this simple confusion, he has in his time greatly contributed to it. If there is, for instance, one thing that is really rare in Shaw it is hesitation. He makes up his mind quicker than a calculating boy or a county magistrate. Yet on this subject of the next change in ethics he has felt hesitation, and being a strictly honest man has expressed it.|$|E

6000|$|A {{little later}} came Gawain Douglas, whose {{translation}} of the Aeneid is linguistically valuable, and whose introductions to the seventh and twelfth books--the one describing winter and the other May--have been safely praised, they are so hard to read. There is certainly some poetic feeling in them, and the welcome to the sun comes as near enthusiasm as is possible for a ploughman, with a good steady yoke of oxen, who lays over one furrow of verse, and then turns about to lay the next as cleverly alongside it as he can. But it is a wrong done to good taste to hold up this item kind of description any longer as deserving any other credit {{than that of a}} good memory. It is a mere bill of parcels, a post-mortem inventory of nature, where imagination is not merely not called for, but would be out of place. Why, a recipe in the cookery-book is as much like a good dinner as <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> is like true word-painting. The poet with a real eye in his head does not give us everything, but only the best of everything. He selects, he combines, or else gives what is characteristic only; while the false style of which I have been speaking seems to be as glad to get a pack of impertinences on its shoulders as Christian in the Pilgrim's Progress was to be rid of his. One strong verse that can hold itself upright (as the French critic Rivarol said of Dante) with the bare help of the substantive and verb, is worth acres of this dead cord-wood piled stick on stick, a boundless continuity of dryness. I would rather have written that half-stanza of Longfellow's, in the [...] "Wreck of the Hesperus," [...] of the [...] "billow that swept her crew like icicles from her deck," [...] than all Gawain Douglas's tedious enumeration of meteorological phenomena put together. A real landscape is never tiresome; it never presents itself to us as a disjointed succession of isolated particulars; we take it in with one sweep of the eye,--its light, its shadow, its melting gradations of distance: we do not say it is this, it is that, and the other; and we may be sure that if a description in poetry is tiresome there is a grievous mistake somewhere. All the pictorial adjectives in the dictionary will not bring it a hair's-breadth nearer to truth and nature.
