5|$|In both later {{works such}} as Caroline Mordaunt and her earlier evangelical texts, Sherwood participated in the Victorian project of {{prescribing}} gender roles; while her later works outlined ever more stringent and narrow roles for each sex, her early {{works such as}} The Fairchild Family suggested such demarcations as well: Lucy and Emily learn to sew and keep house while Henry tends <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>and</b> learns Latin.|$|E
5|$|Marion died in 1919. In 1922, Alfred married Annie Louisa Colby Robinson (1891-1981), the governess to his {{daughter}} Charlotte; they had five children. After Alfred's death in 1942, Annie sold the property. A new owner opened <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>and</b> lath house {{to the public as}} Rosecroft Begonia Gardens. The gardens were a popular tourist attraction through the 1960s. In the 1970s, the property was sold and the garden area subdivided for residential use. The original main residence is privately owned and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|Scholars usually {{agree that}} John {{is not entirely}} without {{historical}} value. It has become generally accepted that certain sayings in John are as old or older than their synoptic counterparts. His representation of the topography around Jerusalem is often superior {{to that of the}} synoptics, his testimony that Jesus was executed before, rather than on, Passover, might well be more accurate, and his presentation of Jesus in <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>and</b> the prior meeting held by the Jewish authorities are possibly more historically plausible than their synoptic parallels.|$|E

5|$|The English Garden is a {{rectangular}} garden featuring brick paths, a pergola that features cypress {{trees at the}} head of <b>the</b> <b>garden,</b> <b>and</b> a number of statues and garden ornaments. The garden has hundreds of native trees, shrubs, and perennials, most notably azaleas. It also features a wall garden, which was built in 1922. The centerpiece of the garden is a large wisteria arbor.|$|E
5|$|The {{front side}} of the left wing shows the Agony in <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> <b>and</b> the Flagellation of Christ.

The front side of the right wing represents the Crowning with thorns and the Bearing of the Cross, all from the Passion of Jesus.|$|E

5|$|Driven {{by early}} {{enjoyment}} of the media coverage of cricket, Agnew developed a love for playing the game. At the end of days spent watching cricket on television in a blacked-out room with the commentary provided by the radio, Agnew would go into <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>and</b> practise his bowling for hours, trying to imitate the players he had seen. Agnew's father, an amateur cricketer, taught him the rudiments of the sport, including an offspin action, as he wanted his son to develop into a bowler like him. Another family connection to cricket was his first cousin, Mary Duggan, who was a women's Test player for England from 1948 to 1963.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) shows Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) to {{a garden}} that Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) has started. Kate discovers that Sun speaks English {{when the two}} are working in <b>the</b> <b>garden,</b> <b>and</b> Sun asks her not to tell anyone. Locke finds Sayid {{trying to make sense}} of Danielle Rousseau's maps, and gives him a compass. Sayid tells Jack that {{according}} to Locke's compass, north is not where it should be, causing him to believe that the instrument is defective. Hurley and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) spend the day fishing. After Hurley fails to catch anything and accidentally steps on a sea urchin after giving up, Jin treats the wound and later gives Hurley a fish.|$|E
5|$|Other {{than his}} stays in hospital, Hess {{spent the rest}} of his life in Spandau prison. His fellow inmates Konstantin von Neurath, Walther Funk and Erich Raeder were {{released}} because of poor health in the 1950s; Karl Dönitz, Baldur von Schirach and Albert Speer served their time and were released; Dönitz in 1956, Schirach and Speer in 1966. The 600-cell prison continued to be maintained for its lone prisoner from Speer and Schirach's release until Hess's death in 1987, at an estimated cost of DM 800,000. Conditions were far more pleasant in the 1980s than in the early years; Hess was allowed to move more freely around the cell block, setting his own routine and choosing his own activities, which included television, films, reading and gardening. A lift was installed so he could more readily access <b>the</b> <b>garden,</b> <b>and</b> he was provided with a medical orderly from 1982 onward.|$|E

5|$|Potter's weariness with {{depicting}} rabbits {{is reflected}} in the book's pictures. Of the twenty-six illustrations, eight depict Mr. McGregor and seventeen <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>and</b> its structures. There are almost no close-ups of the rabbits and none with the detail found in Benjamin Bunny. When the rabbits are depicted, they are viewed in the middle distance in order to include all six as well as the garden background. They are depicted with little or no facial expression. It is likely Potter (a farm owner at the date of the book's composition) had come to view rabbits as undifferentiated pests rather than individual personalities. Several drawings for the illustrations for The Flopsy Bunnies were given to the British Museum in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Reddish {{paintings}} on wooden panels commissioned by Father Antonio Ubeda from 1856 to 1859 {{can be found}} inside the church. These are the Ascension of Our Lord and Pentecost on the doorway; and two portraits of the Doctors of the Church. A third portrait belonging to the set of Doctors of the Church is on the church museum while the fourth portrait is lost. The paintings Agony in <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> <b>and</b> Crowning of Thorns, also commissioned by Father Úbeda, is currently housed at the San Agustin Museum in Intramuros, Manila. The works of art are done by Liberato Gachalian.|$|E
5|$|Repair work {{commenced}} on <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>and</b> undercroft {{in early}} 2008—the beams and columns supporting the terrace having become dangerously weak—and {{was scheduled to}} take three years to complete. The council commissioned NPS Architectural Group to oversee restoration {{and work on the}} memorial itself started in September 2009; the council initially hoped that the project would be complete by Armistice Day 2010. During the repair work the memorial itself was rotated to face the city hall, in accordance with the wishes of local veterans to allow them easier access for parades, and underwent minor restoration work. Its place in the memorial garden was taken by a new bronze sculpture: Breath by Paul de Monchaux. The garden re-opened to the public in March 2011. The memorial and garden was re-dedicated after three years on Armistice Day, 11 November 2011; the repair work had cost £2.6million.|$|E

5|$|She often {{bears the}} brunt of Victor's temper due to muddled misunderstandings and {{in part due to}} her aloof nature. One such {{occasion}} saw Victor asking her to pick up a suit of his from the dry-cleaners, only for her to return with a gorilla costume. Another occasion saw her persuading Victor to take on a dog whose owner had just died. Victor spent time building a kennel in <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>and</b> when Mrs Warboys arrives with the dog, she forgets to mention that the dog is stuffed - much to Victor and Margaret's consternation. On another occasion she won a competition where the prize was either to earn £500 or to have a life-size waxwork model made of herself, which had to be delivered to the Meldrews' house; she chose the waxwork. As it turned out, she hated it as much as Victor and Margaret did, and the waxwork ended up in the dustbin.|$|E
5|$|Sir David further {{extended}} the castle {{in the late}} 16th century, {{with the addition of}} a large north range with round corner towers. He laid out the garden in 1604, with symbols of England, Scotland and Ireland, to celebrate the Union of the Crowns of the previous year, when James VI acceded to the English throne on the death of his cousin, Elizabeth I. Sir David died in 1610, heavily in debt as a result of fines handed down for the unruly conduct of his son, and with both <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>and</b> the north range incomplete.|$|E
5|$|The garden design, asserts the text, {{should include}} rocks and raised mounds of summits, manicured with plants and trees of diverse varieties, {{artificial}} ponds and flowing brooks. It describes the arrangement, the soils, the seeds, {{the distance between}} types of plants and trees, the methods of preparing manure, proper fertilizing and maintaining the garden, which plants and trees are best planted first, when to plant others, watering, signs of overwatering and underwatering, weeds, means of protecting <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>and</b> other details. Both public parks and woodland gardens are described, with about 40 types of trees recommended for the park in the Vana-krida chapter.|$|E
