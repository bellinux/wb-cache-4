25|$|In the mid-1760s, {{a survey}} team divided the Island into 67 lots. On July 1, 1767, these {{properties}} were allocated to supporters of King George III {{by means of}} a lottery. Ownership of the land remained in the hands of landlords in England, angering Island settlers who were unable to gain <b>title</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> on which they worked and lived. Significant rent charges (to absentee landlords) created further anger. The land had been given to the absentee landlords with a number of conditions attached regarding upkeep and settlement terms; many of these conditions were not satisfied. Islanders spent decades trying to convince the Crown to confiscate the lots, however the descendants of the original owners were generally well connected to the British government and refused to give up the land.|$|E

25|$|The {{generality}} of the characterisation {{process is}} not and cannot be wholly scientific. It is always a matter of interpretation. For example, if A, who is a national of Arcadia, dies having made a valid local will and leaves land situated in Barsoom to C, who is domiciled in Catilage, how is the issue to be classified? One might say that any rights that C might have are vested by the will that was made in Arcadia, the lex loci actus. Equally, the right to succeed to title might be an aspect of C's status as the oldest surviving male heir under Cartilagean law, the lex loci domicilii. Also, {{it may be a}} matter for the law of Barsoom since all matters of <b>title</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> must be adjusted by the lex situs, as the law of the place of the land.

25|$|The legal {{institutions}} {{and traditions of}} Australian law are monocultural in character, reflecting its English origins. When the British arrived in Australia, they considered the continent to be terra nullius, or land belonging to no-one, {{on the basis that}} the Aboriginal peoples already inhabiting the continent were too primitive to have lawful possession of the land. Under the English conception of international law at the time, when uninhabited lands were settled by English subjects the laws of England immediately applied to the settled lands. EngR 1]; (1722) 2 Peer William's Reports 75; 24 ER 646. As such, Aboriginal laws and customs, including native <b>title</b> <b>to</b> <b>land,</b> were not recognised. The reception of English law was clarified by the Australian Courts Act 1828 (UK), which provided that all laws and statutes in force in England at the date of enactment should be applied in the courts of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) so far as those laws were applicable. Since Queensland and Victoria were originally part of New South Wales, the same date applies in those States for the reception of English law. South Australia adopted a different date for reception, as did Western Australia.|$|E

25|$|Unrest among wheat farmers, {{especially}} among Norwegian immigrants, {{led to a}} populist political movement centered in the Non Partisan League ("NPL") {{around the time of}} World War I, during which it ran candidates on the Republican ticket (yet merging into the Democratic Party after World War II). It tried to insulate North Dakota from the power of out-of-state banks and corporations. In addition to founding the state-owned Bank of North Dakota and North Dakota Mill and Elevator (both still in existence), the NPL established a state-owned railroad line (later sold to the Soo Line Railroad). Anti-corporate laws virtually prohibited a corporation or bank from owning <b>title</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> zoned as farmland. These laws, still in force today, after having been upheld by state and federal courts, make it almost impossible to foreclose on farmland, as even after foreclosure, the property title cannot be held by a bank or mortgage company. Furthermore, the Bank of North Dakota, having powers similar to a Federal Reserve branch bank, exercised its power to limit the issuance of subprime mortgages and their collateralization in the form of derivative instruments, and so prevented a collapse of housing prices within the state in the wake of 2008's financial crisis.|$|E
25|$|The {{explanation}} above discloses another {{difference between}} title insurance and other types: title insurance premiums are not principally calculated {{on the basis}} of actuarial science, as is true in most other types of insurance. Instead of correlating the probability of losses with their projected costs, title insurance seeks to eliminate the source of the losses through the use of the recording system and other underwriting practices. As a result, a relatively small fraction of title insurance premiums are used to pay insured losses. The great majority of the premiums is used to finance the title research on each piece of property and to maintain the title plants used to efficiently do that research. There is significant social utility in this approach as the result conforms with the expectations of most property purchasers and mortgage lenders. Generally, they want the real estate they purchased or lent money on to have the title condition they expected when they entered the transaction, rather than money compensation and litigation over unexpected defects. This {{is not to say that}} title insurers take no actuarial risks. There are several matters that can affect the <b>title</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> that are not disclosed by the recording system but that are covered by the policies. Some examples are deeds executed by minors or mentally incompetent persons, forged instruments (in some cases), corporate instruments executed without the proper corporate authority and errors in the public records. However, historically, these problems have not amounted to a high percentage of the losses paid by the insurers. A more significant percentage of losses paid by the insurers are the result of errors and omissions in the title examining process itself.|$|E
500|$|Hale {{was born}} on 1 November 1609 in West End House (now known as The Grange or Alderley Grange) in Alderley, Gloucestershire to Robert Hale, a {{barrister}} of Lincoln's Inn, and Joanna Poyntz. His father gave up his practise as a barrister several years before Hale's birth [...] "because he could not understand the reason of giving colour in pleadings". This refers to a process through which the defendant would refer a case over the validity of his <b>title</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> to a judge instead of a jury, through claiming a (false) allegation about this right. Such an allegation would be a question of law rather than a question of fact, and as such decided by the judge with no reference to the jurors. Although in common use, Robert Hale apparently saw this as deceptive and [...] "contrary to the exactness of truth and justice which became a Christian; so that he withdrew himself from the inns of court to live on his estate in the country". John Hostettler, in his biography of Matthew Hale, points out that his father's concerns about giving colour in pleadings {{could not have been}} very strong [...] "since he not only retired to his estate at Alderley where he managed to live on his wife's inherited income, but also directed in his will that Matthew should make a career in the law".|$|E

2500|$|In 1606, {{shortly before}} {{colonization}} began, James I of England granted the Charter of 1606 {{to the newly}} established Virginia Company, asserting royal title to Native American-occupied land between the 34th and 45th latitudes and [...] inland, and permitting the Virginia Company to establish colonies there.

The charter created a conflicting title to the overlapping area between the 38th and 41st parallels, but since no colonies were planned for the area the conflict did not initially create problems. In 1609, James I redefined the Colony of Virginia's boundaries so that the northern boundary projected northwest from the coast, as well as asserting title to all land west to the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

2500|$|Waddington was of {{the view}} that fears of the {{introduction}} of smallpox {{was the cause of}} the unrest.
