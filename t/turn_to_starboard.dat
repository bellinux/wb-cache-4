5|$|By 23:30, the High Seas Fleet {{had entered}} its night {{cruising}} formation. The order had largely been inverted, {{with the four}} Nassau-class ships in the lead, followed directly by the Helgolands, with the Kaisers and Königs astern of them. The rear was again brought up by the elderly pre-dreadnoughts; the mauled German battlecruisers were by this time scattered. At around midnight on 1 June, the Helgoland- and Nassau-class ships {{in the center of}} the German line came into contact with the British 4th Destroyer Flotilla. The 4th Flotilla broke off the action temporarily to regroup, but at around 01:00, unwittingly stumbled into the German dreadnoughts a second time. Helgoland and Oldenburg opened fire on the two leading British destroyers. Helgoland fired six salvos from her secondary guns at the destroyer Fortune before she succumbed to the tremendous battering. Shortly after, Helgoland shifted fire to an unidentified destroyer; Helgoland fired five salvos from her 15cm guns to unknown effect. The British destroyers launched torpedoes at the German ships, but they managed to successfully evade them with a <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard.</b>|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{returned}} to waters off Okinawa on 4 May and renewed its {{attacks on the}} airfields on the Sakishima Islands. Vice-Admiral Bernard Rawlings, second {{in command of the}} BPF, and his staff had determined that bombardment of Japanese gun positions by the heavy guns of battleships and cruisers might be a more effective method of destroying them than aerial attack. They detached King George V and Howe, as well as five cruisers, that morning to bombard Nobara and Hiara airfields while fighters flew a protective CAP over them and spotted the fall of their shells. The loss of the most effective anti-aircraft ships was more important than anticipated and the Japanese were {{able to take advantage of}} the opportunity. The carrier had just launched two Corsairs for bombardment-spotting duties and the deck park of eleven Avengers was being moved forward to allow aircraft to land when an undetected Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter attacked at 11:31. The Zero first strafed the flight deck before any of Formidables guns could open fire and then turned sharply to dive into the forward flight deck despite the ship's hard <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard.</b> The fighter released a bomb shortly before it would have impacted the deck and was destroyed by the bomb's blast, although the remnants of the Zero struck Formidable.|$|E
25|$|Colombo did not {{consider}} any <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard</b> practical. If he made a slight <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard,</b> and the ferry responded according to practice (to yield to the larger vessel), {{then he would have}} turned toward the ferry and a collision. If he made a radical <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard,</b> he would have been in jeopardy of collision with the ship moored at the grain elevator.|$|E

5000|$|... "Carolyn" [...] was {{not dead}} - yet. After U-123 <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard,</b> Atik {{gathered}} steerage way, paralleling her course by <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard</b> as well, and dropped her concealment, commencing fire from her main and secondary batteries. The first shell dropped {{short of the}} U-boat, as she made off presenting a small target; the others were off in deflection. A veritable hail of [...]50-caliber machine gun fire, though, ricochetted around the U-boats decks as she put on speed to escape the trap into which Hardegen had fallen. One bullet mortally wounded a midshipman standing watch on U-123s bridge.|$|R
25|$|During the forenoon {{watch on}} 6 July 1944, however, an escort {{on the port}} side of the convoy {{obtained}} a sound contact, the alarm prompting the ships to make an emergency 45 degree <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard</b> at 10:53. Zeus went to general quarters at 10:56, after which time an escort dropped depth charges at 10:57. The battle damage repair ship resumed her original base course at 11:13, then secured from general quarters seven minutes later. The convoy resumed zig-zagging (11:30-15:30), suspended steering those courses for a brief period while one escort and two ships from the group left on duty assigned (15:40), then again began steering zig-zag courses twenty minutes later, with Zeus being ordered to assume a new position at 16:15. The passage proceeded uneventfully for a little over an hour, before an escort ahead of the disposition made a sound contact at 17:16, with general quarters being sounded again, with the convoy steering another emergency 45 degree <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard.</b> Subsequently, the disposition resumed steering zig-zag courses at 17:30, with Zeus standing down from general quarters two minutes later. The convoy continued its zig-zagging until noon on 8 July, then reached Eniwetok a little less than four hours later. Steering various courses and speeds to conform to the channel, Zeus anchored in berth 526 in the central anchorage at 18:45.|$|E
25|$|The Andrea Doria–Stockholm {{collision}} led {{to several}} rule {{changes in the}} immediate years following the incident to avoid a recurrence. Since this was essentially a radar-assisted collision event, in which over-use was made of poorly handled technology, shipping lines were required to improve training {{on the use of}} radar equipment. Also, approaching ships were required to make radio contact with one another. Both ships saw each other on their radar systems and attempted to turn. Unfortunately, one of the radar systems was poorly designed, resulting in the collision. Marine craft today are required to <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard</b> (right) in a head-on situation.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the new {{propeller}} steamer Ogdensburg was heading the other way, from Cleveland to Ogdensburg, New York, carrying {{a load of}} wheat. At 2 am on 20 August, the paths of the two ships crossed near Long Point. On board Ogdensburg, the first mate, Degrass McNeil, was on duty. He spotted lights from Atlantic but was sure that Ogdensburg would pass {{at least a half}} mile ahead of the other ship. But then Atlantic changed course, turning north as though trying to pass in front of Ogdensburg. McNeil ordered Ogdensburg engines reversed and the ship turned to port, and since Ogdensburg steam whistle was broken, McNeil ran out onto the ship's deck and yelled to try and get the other ship to <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Globe Star {{stranding}} {{was attributed}} to a navigation error, in that the ship approached {{too close to the}} harbour entrance prior to picking up a pilot, and having been advised to return <b>to</b> the anchorage, <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard</b> instead of port and ran aground.|$|R
5000|$|Twenty minutes later, Ajax and Achilles <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>to</b> {{bring all}} their guns to bear, causing Admiral Graf Spee <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> away and lay a smoke screen. At 07:10, the two light cruisers <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> reduce the range from 8 mi, {{even though this}} meant that only their forward guns could fire. At 07:16, Admiral Graf Spee <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> port and headed {{straight}} for the badly damaged Exeter, but fire from Ajax and Achilles forced her at 07:20 <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> and fire her 283 mm guns at them, while they <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>to</b> bring all their guns <b>to</b> bear. Ajax <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard</b> at 07:24 and fired her torpedoes at a range of 4.5 mi, causing Admiral Graf Spee <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> away under a smoke screen. At 07:25, Ajax was hit by a 283 mm shell that put [...] "X" [...] turret out of action and jammed [...] "Y" [...] turret, causing some casualties. By 07:40, Ajax and Achilles were running low on resources, and the British decided to change tactics, moving to the east under a smoke screen. Harwood decided to shadow Admiral Graf Spee and try to attack at night, when he could attack with torpedoes and better use his advantages of speed and manoeuvrability, while minimising his deficiencies in armour. Ajax was again hit by a 283 mm shell that destroyed her mast and caused more casualties; Admiral Graf Spee continued to the south-west.|$|R
5000|$|While their {{squadron}} mates <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard</b> {{and put on}} steam for a run to {{the west}} behind them, Vizcaya followed Infanta Maria Teresa closely as she charged Brooklyn as if to ram.

500|$|Nassau and {{the rest}} of the ISquadron were again engaged by British light forces shortly after 22:00, {{including}} the light cruisers , , and [...] Nassau followed her sister Westfalen in a 68° <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard</b> in order to evade any torpedoes that might have been fired. The two ships fired on Caroline and Royalist at a range of around [...] The British ships turned away briefly, before turning about to launch torpedoes. Caroline fired two at Nassau; the first passed close to her bows and the second passed under the ship without exploding.|$|E
500|$|While Warrior was {{retreating}} northward {{under the}} cover of her own smoke, the battleship [...] came too close to her sister , and had to <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard</b> in order to avoid collision. At that moment, a shell from Kaiser struck Warspites steering gear and jammed them, temporarily leaving the ship only able to steam in a large circle. Friedrich der Grosse, König, two Nassau and three Helgoland-class battleships fired on Warspite for a period of about 20 minutes; Warspite was hit 11 times before the Germans lost sight of her. Because her steering gear could not be adequately repaired, Warspite was forced to withdraw from the battle; her absence prompted the Germans to believe they had sunk her.|$|E
500|$|Later on {{the first}} day of the battle, the hard-pressed battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group were being pursued by their British opponents. Hannover and the other {{so-called}} [...] "five-minute ships" [...] came to their aid by steaming in between the opposing battlecruiser squadrons. The ships were very briefly engaged, owing in large part to the poor visibility. Hannover fired eight rounds from her 28cm guns during this period. The British battlecruiser [...] fired on Hannover several times until the latter was obscured by smoke. Hannover was struck once by fragments from one of the [...] shells fired by Princess Royal. Mauve decided it would be inadvisable to continue the fight against the much more powerful battlecruisers, and so ordered an 8-point <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard.</b>|$|E
25|$|At 18:50 Scharnhorst <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>to</b> {{engage the}} {{destroyer}}s Savage and Saumarez, but this allowed Scorpion and the Norwegian destroyer Stord to attack with torpedoes, scoring one {{hit on the}} starboard side. As Scharnhorst continued <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> avoid the torpedoes, Savage and Saumarez scored three hits on her port side. Saumarez was hit several times by Scharnhorsts secondary armament and suffered eleven killed and eleven wounded.|$|R
5000|$|Vincennes {{opened fire}} at 1644 with her 5 in/25 cal, 20 mm, and 1.1 in {{anti-aircraft}} batteries. Increasing her speed to 25 kn and slowly <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard,</b> Vincennes kept her port guns {{trained on the}} enemy. While combing torpedo tracks, Vincennes hit a [...] "Kate" [...] and it went into the sea 150 yd off her port bow.|$|R
5000|$|As soon as Hornet was sighted, Dickenson steered for the sloop and {{prepared}} to engage. Penguin had the weather gage and for a time, Hornet ran before Penguin, yawing occasionally to avoid being raked. Then Penguin <b>turned</b> up-wind <b>to</b> port at almost the same moment as Hornet <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard.</b> The two vessels exchanged broadsides for 15 minutes, with the range gradually closing from [...] "musket shot".|$|R
500|$|Later on {{the first}} day of the battle, Hipper's badly damaged battlecruisers were being engaged by their British rivals. Schleswig-Holstein and the other {{so-called}} [...] "five-minute ships" [...] came to their aid by steaming in between the opposing battlecruiser squadrons. These ships were very briefly engaged, owing in large part to the poor visibility. The visibility was so bad, the gunners aboard Schleswig-Holstein could not make out a target, and she did not fire her main guns. At 21:35 a heavy caliber shell struck the ship on the port-side, punching a hole approximately 40cm (16in) wide before exploding against the inner casemate armor. It tore apart [...] of the superstructure deck and disabled one of the port side casemate guns. Three men were killed and nine were wounded. Admiral Mauve halted the fight against the much more powerful battlecruisers and ordered an 8-point <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard.</b>|$|E
500|$|A shell {{from one}} of the British cruisers hit Mainz at around 13:00, which jammed her rudder at ten degrees to starboard. Her crew shut off the port engine in an attempt to correct the ship's course, but she {{continued}} to <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard.</b> By 13:20, the majority of the ship's guns had been disabled and the ship's superstructure had been shot to pieces. Her center and aft funnel collapsed after suffering several hits. A torpedo from the destroyer [...] then hit the ship on her port side, amidships; this prompted the ship's commander to order the crew to abandon the stricken cruiser. He then left the conning tower with the navigation officer, both of whom were immediately killed by a shell hit. The ship's communication system was out of service, and so the order to abandon ship did not reach the entire crew. The ship's executive officer then reached the bridge, and reiterated the order to abandon the crippled ship at 13:35.|$|E
500|$|Jessen {{made another}} 180° turn {{in an attempt}} to interpose his two ships between the Japanese and Rurik, but the latter ship {{suddenly}} <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard</b> and increased speed and passed between Jessen's ships and the Japanese. Kamimura turned 180° as well so that both squadrons were heading southeast on parallel courses, but Jessen quickly made another 180° turn so that they headed on opposing courses. The Russians reversed course for the third time around 07:45 in another attempt to support Rurik although Rossia was on fire herself; her fires were extinguished about twenty minutes later. Kamimura circled Rurik to the south at 08:00 and allowed the other two Russian ships to get to his north and gave them an uncontested route to Vladivostok. Despite this, Jessen turned back once more at 08:15 and ordered Rurik to make her own way back to Vladivostok before turning north at his maximum speed, about [...]|$|E
500|$|U-881 {{became the}} fifth and final U-boat to be sunk during Operation Teardrop on 5 May. The boat was {{detected}} while attempting to pass submerged through the barrier line by [...] shortly before daybreak. The destroyer escort immediately <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard</b> and dropped depth charges, which sank the submarine with no survivors at 0616. U-881 was the last German submarine to be sunk by the U.S. Navy during World War II.|$|R
50|$|The fourth destroyer, however, sighted S-37 as {{the fourth}} torpedo was fired and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard.</b> At 2041, S-37 dived and rigged for depth charging. By 2043, the three {{remaining}} destroyers were overhead, pinging. S-37 ran silent. Between 2050 and 2215, the searching destroyers dropped depth charges at 10-15 minute intervals. S-37 reached 267 ft as she evaded. By 2230, the destroyers {{had moved out}} of the area. S-37 reloaded and resumed the hunt.|$|R
25|$|During {{the early}} part of the evening, Voyager had no {{difficulties}} maintaining her position during the manoeuvres both ships performed. Following a series of <b>turns</b> intended <b>to</b> reverse the courses of both ships beginning at 8:40pm, Voyager ended up <b>to</b> <b>starboard</b> of Melbourne. At 8:52pm, Voyager was ordered to resume the plane guard station.

500|$|Hipper's battlecruisers {{spotted the}} Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 15:20, but Beatty's ships {{did not see}} the Germans to their east until 15:30. Two minutes later, Beatty ordered a course change to east-southeast, {{positioning}} the British ships to cut off the German's line of retreat, and signalled action stations. Hipper ordered his ships to <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard,</b> away from the British, to assume a south-easterly course, and reduced speed to [...] to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up. With this turn, Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet, [...] behind him. Beatty then altered course to the east, as he was still too far north to cut Hipper off. This was later characterised as the [...] "Run to the South" [...] as Beatty changed course to steer east-southeast at 15:45, now paralleling Hipper's course less than [...] away.

Hipper's battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 3:20pm, but Beatty's ships did not spot the Germans to their east until 3:30. Almost immediately afterwards, at 3:32, he ordered a course change to east south-east to position himself astride the Germans' line of retreat and called his ships' crews to action stations. Hipper ordered his ships to <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard,</b> away from the British, to assume a south-easterly course, and reduced speed to [...] to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up.

500|$|Aoba, {{continuing}} to receive damaging hits, <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>to</b> head away from Scott's formation and began making a smoke screen which led {{most of the}} Americans {{to believe that she}} was sinking. Scott's ships shifted their fire to Furutaka, which was following behind Aoba. At 23:49, Furutaka was hit in her torpedo tubes, igniting a large fire that attracted even more shellfire from the US ships. At 23:58, a torpedo from Buchanan hit Furutaka in her forward engine room, causing severe damage. During this time, San Francisco and Boise sighted Fubuki about [...] away and raked her with shellfire, joined soon by {{most of the rest of}} Scott's formation. Heavily damaged, Fubuki began to sink. Kinugasa and Hatsuyuki chose <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> port rather than starboard and escaped the Americans' immediate attention.|$|R
50|$|While {{steaming}} through Badoeng Strait on {{the night}} of 19/20 February during the Battle of Badoeng Strait, Pillsbury fired three torpedoes at a Japanese ship without result. A searchlight was trained on Pillsbury, and several shots were fired at her. She <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard</b> and made smoke to escape the light. The relatively small Allied forces at this time were forced to lightning strikes and rapid evasive retirement in the face of superior Japanese forces in the dim hope of disrupting the enemy advance.|$|R
2500|$|By 1035 hrs Alcantara {{was reduced}} to about [...] and her after {{steering}} gear was disabled. Her helm seemed to be jammed hard over <b>to</b> <b>starboard</b> but she was <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>starboard.</b> Wardle ordered his company to cease fire, stop engines and go to boat stations. The order to stop engines was not received, but flooding in the engine room stopped them. Several of Alcantaras lifeboat falls had been damaged by enemy fire, so that attempts to launch some boats caused men to be dropped into the sea. Alcantara rolled, capsized and sank at 1102 hrs. At least 15 of her boats and a large liferaft floated clear.|$|R
