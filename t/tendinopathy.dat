25|$|The {{most common}} {{injuries}} {{associated with the}} knee in cricket occur when a player is bowling. In the landing stride, bowlers are constantly twisting and putting extreme force through the knee joint, this can then result in a strain or more severely a tear to the collateral ligaments. Patellar <b>tendinopathy</b> is a common knee injury that occurs most commonly in bowlers due to the overuse of the tendon {{which can lead to}} the tendon fibres beginning to break down. David Lawrence, an English fast bowler is one particular example of how the landing stride when bowling can cause serious injuries to the knee. On 10 February 1992, his left patella shattered during a delivery.|$|E

Cielo was in constant pain, and the injury started to hurt his training and performance. The nadir was at the 2012 London Olympics, where Cielo was already struggling at the start. In September, he had {{an operation}} on the patellar tendon. [...] "He had a chronic wear of the patellar tendon, which generated an inflammatory process that bothered him greatly.

Basic research is quite optimistic but evidence-based studies examining the treatment of human <b>tendinopathies</b> are lacking. Nevertheless, such treatments are increasingly used in clinical practice and expectations of those injections are high. However, the use of autologous blood injections for the management of chronic human <b>tendinopathies</b> can currently not be recommended...|$|R

2500|$|There are {{numerous}} appropriate approaches to handling pain resulting from Achilles tendinitis. The primary action is to rest. Activities {{that do not}} provide additional stress to the affected tendon are also recommended. Wearing orthothics or prostheses will provide cushion and will prevent the affected Achilles tendon from experiencing further stress when walking and performing therapeutic stretches. A few stretch modalities or eccentric exercises such as toe extension and flexion and calf and heel stretch are beneficial in lowering pain with Achilles <b>tendinopathy</b> patients (Figure 4) ...|$|E
2500|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) and ultrasound are comparable in efficacy and helpful in diagnosis although {{both have a}} false positive rate of 15 - 20%. [...] MRI can reliably detect most full-thickness tears although very small pinpoint tears may be missed. In such situations, an MRI combined with an injection of contrast material, an MR-arthrogram, may help to confirm the diagnosis. [...] It should be realized that a normal MRI cannot fully rule out a small tear (a false negative) while partial-thickness tears are not as reliably detected. While MRI is sensitive in identifying tendon degeneration (<b>tendinopathy),</b> it may not reliably distinguish between a degenerative tendon and a partially torn tendon. Again, magnetic resonance arthrography can improve the differentiation. An overall sensitivity of 91% (9% false negative rate) has been reported indicating that magnetic resonance arthrography is reliable in the detection of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears. However, its routine use is not advised, since it involves entering the joint with a needle with potential risk of infection. Consequently, the test is reserved for {{cases in which the}} diagnosis remains unclear.|$|E
50|$|Tendon {{injury and}} {{resulting}} <b>tendinopathy</b> {{are responsible for}} up to 30% of consultations to sports doctors and other musculoskeletal health providers. <b>Tendinopathy</b> is most often seen in tendons of athletes either before or after an injury but is becoming more common in non-athletes and sedentary populations. For example, the majority of patients with Achilles <b>tendinopathy</b> in a general population-based study did not associate their condition with a sporting activity. In another study the population incidence of Achilles <b>tendinopathy</b> increased sixfold from 1979-1986 to 1987-1994. The incidence of rotator cuff <b>tendinopathy</b> ranges from 0.3% to 5.5% and annual prevalence from 0.5% to 7.4%.|$|E
30|$|The {{first-line}} {{pharmacological treatment}} for <b>tendinopathies</b> {{is most often}} based on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are useful for pain control but may cause patients to ignore warning symptoms, resulting in further damage to the affected tendon [3, 8]. Intratendinous injections of corticosteroids are also common in the standard management of <b>tendinopathies</b> and appear to successfully reduce inflammation and pain at short-term; however, the risk-benefit ratio of their use {{in the treatment of}} <b>tendinopathies</b> is currently controversial [7, 9]. Owing to the limitations of pharmacological treatments in modifying the structure of the tendon, the management of <b>tendinopathies</b> usually includes other non-pharmacological interventions with proven benefits in tendon recovery such as relative rest, cold, ultrasound, and physical therapy, specifically eccentric style exercises and stretching to prevent stiffness [1, 3]. Other non-pharmacological interventions proposed include shock wave therapy, iontophoresis, sclerotherapy, and nitric oxide patches; however, results are not very consistent and multicenter trials are needed to confirm their efficacy. Among all of the physical therapeutic interventions, eccentric strengthening has shown remarkably good therapeutic outcomes in the treatment of various <b>tendinopathies</b> such as those affecting the patellar, Achilles, supraspinatus, and wrist tendons [1, 10 – 14].|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: <b>Tendinopathies</b> and tendon tears {{account for}} over 30 % of all {{musculoskeletal}} consultations. Obesity, which is {{becoming one of}} the world´s most prevalent public health issues, may be associated with this condition. Objective: To review the literature about <b>tendinopathies</b> and obesity association. Methods: This is a descriptive exploratory study using the portal Medline. Literature in English language from 2006 to 2014 were reviewed. Results: The pathogenesis of <b>tendinopathies</b> includes inflammatory, regenerative and degenerative processes that happen simultaneously from early to late phases of the disease. Mechanical stress upon tendons seems {{to be one of the}} most important factors to initiate the inflammatory response, but it´s not the only one that can deflagrate it: there are other extrinsic, genetic and metabolic factors that may be involved. Therefore, <b>tendinopathies</b> in obese patients can be due to tendon overload because of the excess of weight, but also because of increased production of pro-inflammatory mediators related to fat tissue such as adipokines. This pro-inflammatory state that obese people can suffer is known as adiposopathy, or sick fat syndrome. Weight loss is associated with decrease in adipokines and improvement of musculoskeletal symptoms. Conclusion: The relation of obesity and <b>tendinopathies</b> is supported by evidences of recent studies, exemplified in this review of literature...|$|R
30|$|Diagnostic {{ultrasound}} (US) in <b>tendinopathies</b> is {{the most}} appropriate and advantageous imaging modality for routine clinical evaluation (Warden et al. 2007; Roy et al. 2015). A US-guided technique has demonstrated more accuracy rate than the landmark-guided technique in {{the greater part of}} the joints and tendons (Kane and Koski 2016). Therefore, the use of US imaging in the diagnosis and treatment of <b>tendinopathies</b> should be mandatory.|$|R

50|$|The exact {{etiology}} of <b>tendinopathy</b> {{has not been}} fully elucidated and different stresses may induce varying responses in different tendons. There are multifactorial theories that could include: tensile overload, tenocyte related collagen synthesis disruption, load-induced ischemia, neural sprouting, thermal damage, and adaptive compressive responses. The intratendinous sliding motion of fascicles and shear force at interfaces of fascicles could be an important mechanical factor {{for the development of}} <b>tendinopathy</b> and predispose tendons to rupture. Obesity, or more specifically, adiposity or fatness, has also been linked to an increasing incidence of <b>tendinopathy.</b>|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{restorative}} {{properties of}} platelets, through the local release of growth factors, {{are used in}} various medical areas. This article reviews fundamental and clinical research relating to platelet-rich plasma applied to tendinous lesions. Materials and method: Articles in French and English, published between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2014 dealing with PRP and tendons were searched for using the Medline and Scopus data bases.

40|$|Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) may {{represent}} a new therapeutic option for chronic <b>tendinopathies.</b> Platelets release various cytokines and growth factors which promote angiogenesis, tissue remodeling, and wound healing. We made an exhaustive review {{of the use of}} PRP in chronic tendinopathies: epicondylitis, rotator cuff, patellar and calcaneal <b>tendinopathies,</b> and plantar fasciitis. Medline, Embase and Google Scholar were used (until July 31, 2012). Clinical studies about PRP and <b>tendinopathies</b> (in English and French language peer-reviewed journals) were included.

Despite the proven efficacy of PRP on tissue regeneration in experimental studies, there is currently scanty tangible clinical evidence with respect to chronic tendon disorders.

40|$|Damage to {{the mutual}} and {{delicate}} articular relationships {{of the foot}} may lead to functional failure. A painful foot can be the heralding sign of inflammatory, metabolic or degenerative rheumatic disease that may cause severe disability if left untreated. Healthy tendons are brilliant white in colour, are fibroelastic in texture and can withstand huge mechanical loads. Pathological tendons are characterised by changes in cellular function, rupture of collagen bundles, increased production of the proteoglycan-water matrix and neurovascular proliferation. According to the underlying disease, <b>tendinopathies</b> may present with pain of variable duration and intensity and with functional impairment, {{or they may be}} an asymptomatic finding on imaging techniques. Pain is the most common presenting symptom in the inflammatory rheumatic diseases of the ankle and the foot and usually precedes ultrasound or radiographic changes; pain results from inflammatory changes of the synovia and soft tissue structures including bursae, tendons, fascias and peripheral nerves. The management of <b>tendinopathies</b> in inflammatory and non-inflammatory rheumatic patients includes "articular economy," pharmacological treatment, foot orthotics, cryotherapy, instrumental physiotherapy, rehabilitation and physical. This review highlights the differences between <b>tendinopathies</b> occurring in non-inflammatory rheumatic disorders compared to those appearing in the course of inflammatory rheumatic disorders and defines a conservative management framework that non-rheumatologists (orthopaedic surgeons) and rheumatologists could adhere for the management of foot <b>tendinopathies...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Elbow <b>tendinopathies</b> {{are common}} {{conditions}} that typically last 6 to 24 months. There {{is no clear}} consensus in the literature regarding the most effective management. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous blood product used for elbow <b>tendinopathies</b> {{with the aim of}} enhancing tissue regeneration. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available evidence on the effectiveness and safety of PRP for reducing pain and physical function in elbow <b>tendinopathies.</b> Methods: Electronic databases were searched for relevant studies and data were extracted regarding the design, sample characteristics, interventions, and outcome measures. Each study was critically appraised for methodological quality using a modified tool for quantitative studies and presented in a narrative summary. Results: The search strategy identified 299 hits related to platelet-rich plasma and/or elbow <b>tendinopathies.</b> Five studies met the inclusion criteria; all were randomized controlled trials except one cohort study. All five studies showed improvements from baseline in pain and physical function with a PRP intervention. One study and its follow-up study showed significant improvements in pain and function with PRP compared to corticosteroid at 26, 52, and 104 weeks. Two studies compared PRP to whole blood, which did not find sufficient evidence to suggest one is more effective than the other. A cohort study found PRP was more effective than placebo at 4 and 8 weeks. Three studies reported on the safety of PRP and found no significant adverse effects. Conclusions: The current literature has some limitations and is insufficient to provide strong recommendations regarding the use of PRP in elbow <b>tendinopathies</b> over other modalities; however, these studies suggest that PRP may be more efficacious than corticosteroid injections, but that whole blood injections may be as effective as PRP...|$|R
