25|$|In 839 Jang proved {{instrumental}} in the seizure of power by Silla's King Sinmu following the overthrow of King Minae. Kim Ujing (later King Sinmu) approached Jang for help in taking the throne from the usurper who had killed Ujing‘s father. Jang is purported to have replied, “The ancients had a saying, ‘To see {{what is right and}} not to do it is want of courage.’ <b>Though</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> without ability, I shall follow your orders.” Thereupon Jang dispatched a force of 5000 men under the command of his closest companion and adviser Jeong Yeon (who had since also returned from Tang) in support of Sinmu's claim. The success of Sinmu's power grab won Jang Bogo the post of Prime Minister.|$|E
500|$|The poem {{most likely}} {{originated}} in the poetry that Gray composed in 1742. William Mason, in Memoirs, discussed his friend Gray and the origins of Elegy: [...] "I am inclined {{to believe that the}} Elegy in a Country Church-yard was begun, if not concluded, at this time [...] also: <b>Though</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> aware that as it stands at present, the conclusion is of a later date; how that was originally I shall show in my notes on the poem." [...] Mason's argument was a guess, but he argued that one of Gray's poems from the Eton Manuscript, a copy of Gray's handwritten poems owned by Eton College, was a 22-stanza rough draft of the Elegy called [...] "Stanza's Wrote in a Country Church-Yard". The manuscript copy contained many ideas which were reworked and revised as he attempted to work out the ideas that would later form the Elegy. A later copy was entered into Gray's commonplace book and a third version, included in an 18 December 1750 letter, was sent to Thomas Wharton. The draft sent to Walpole was subsequently lost.|$|E

Perhaps the best-known letter from Lee to Wong is that of 11 January 1970, which has been translated into English as an appendix to an article by Wong.|$|E

2500|$|After the 1886 season Spalding sold Kelly to the Boston Beaneaters for a then-record $10,000, after Kelly {{balked at}} {{returning}} to the club. Right before the sale, Chicago writer Happy Palmer quoted Spalding about his plans to manage Kelly: [...] "Oh, tie him up, I guess, if he really is averse to playing here. He may have his ugly up, and I guess {{from the way he}} is holding out in his refusal to sign that that is the case. All right, <b>though.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> willing, and if he keeps on in that spirit I’ll make him eat hay with his horses before he is much older. He has been mad long enough now, and it is pretty near time somebody was getting mad at this end of the line. One thing I can certainly predict and that is that if Mr. Mike Kelly does not sign a contract with Chicago pretty d--d quick, he will have cause to regret it. That is all." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 1934 Abe {{was arrested}} in a police raid on the {{unlicensed}} brothel at which she {{was working at the}} time. Kinnosuke Kasahara, a well-connected friend of the brothel owner, arranged for her release. He was attracted to Abe, finding that she had no debts, and with Abe's agreement, made her his mistress. Kasahara set up a house for Abe on December 20, 1934, and also provided her with an income. In his deposition to the police, he remembered, [...] "She was really strong, a real powerful one. Even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> pretty jaded, she was enough to astound me. She wasn't satisfied unless we did it two, three, or four times a night. To her, it was unacceptable unless I had my hand on her private parts all night long... At first it was great, but after a couple of weeks I got a little exhausted." [...] When Abe suggested that Kasahara leave his wife to marry her, he refused. She then asked Kasahara to allow her to take another lover, which he also refused to do. Afterwards, their relationship ended, and to escape him Abe left for Nagoya. Kasahara ended his testimony with an angry remark about Abe, [...] "She is a slut and a whore. And as what she has done makes clear, she is a woman whom men should fear." [...] Likewise, Abe remembered Kasahara in less than flattering terms, saying, [...] "He didn't love me and treated me like an animal. He was the kind of scum who would then plead with me when I said that we should break up." ...|$|E
