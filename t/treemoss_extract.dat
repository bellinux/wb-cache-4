Oakmoss extract (Evernia prunastri extract) as a strong contact allergen {{is part of this}} list and must be named in the list of ingredients referred to in Art. 19 (1)(g) when its concentration exceeds 0.001 % in leave-on products and 0.01 % in rinse-off products. Despite this restriction, there were 747 notifiers for oakmoss extract in the C&L inventory. According to the INCI list, oakmoss extract is used with the function of skin conditioning. Oakmoss is also listed in the INCI list part II (perfume and aromatic raw materials), together with <b>treemoss</b> <b>extract</b> (Evernia furfuracea lichen extract).|$|E
40|$|This is a {{comprehensive}} review of extracts from the lichen Pseudevernia furfuracea (treemoss) that are used in the fragrance industry. Qualitative and quantitative analytical aspects are critically reviewed and the results are compared to those of the related oakmoss extracts. It is shown that more than 90 constituents have been identified so far in <b>treemoss</b> <b>extracts,</b> including 42 depsides, depsidones or depside-derived compounds, and 42 triterpenes or steroids. Constituents of certain host trees, mainly Pinus species, generate specific analytical and toxicological issues which need to be considered in addition to those related to the known degradation products of lichen compounds. A new classification of lichen extracts used as raw materials in fragrance compounding is proposed...|$|R
