500|$|The Ballymun {{area was}} still so {{associated}} with [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] {{and the drug}} problem of the time, that local backers of the regeneration went to pains {{to point out the}} recent progress. [...] A Bono remark that it was dangerous to walk in Ballymun at night found a good deal of publicity. [...] A fansite listing U2-related Dublin area sights in 2004 mentioned Ballymun's connection to the song, cautioning, [...] "do not go here on foot – <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> area". U2's official website noted that the area was much changed now; Bono himself said [...] "he's very proud to come from the Ballymun area"; the fansite subsequently modified its listing and said an on-foot visit to Ballymun was warranted.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool midfielder Vladimír Šmicer {{was looking}} forward to playing a part in the final: [...] "Everyone wants to play in the final, I'm no different. I was just happy to be on the pitch against Auxerre because I didn't know even the day before whether I'd be fit enough after my injury problem. I'm still not 100% fit, I just wanted to train well this week and be fit for the final." [...] Šmicer was hopeful that victory in the final would rescue Liverpool's season: [...] "I hope that this re-ignites our season. Our season is not good, we know, but there is still plenty to play for. We have not said <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> season, let's forget about it and {{concentrate}} on the next one, we have been criticised and we are intent on responding on the pitch." [...] Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy was eager to win the match: [...] "Winning in Cardiff would be a massive result for us, we have to be honest, we haven't been as good as Manchester United over the last 10 years. And winning would bring European football next year, which isn't guaranteed at the moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> omen folks. Garcia is tapping Morales' {{guard with}} his left hand, {{literally}} telling Morales where the next shot is going to come. After four taps, Morales decides it's time to get aggressive. Bad move. Garcia blasts Morales with a left hook that launches Morales through the ropes. You {{can see it in}} Morales' eyes, he's not getting back up. KO for Garcia." ...|$|E

25|$|Patrick's 6 month HIV tests {{came back}} at the same time. They came back inconclusive. Robin tried her best to {{convince}} him to take it again but Patrick was stubborn and believed <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> sign telling him he was positive.|$|R
2500|$|Fuel for {{agricultural}} use often {{does not have}} fuel taxes (farmers get duty-free petrol or diesel fuel). [...] Biofuels may have subsidies [...] and low/no retail fuel taxes. Biofuels compete with retail gasoline and diesel prices which have substantial taxes included. [...] The net result {{is that it is}} possible for a farmer to use more than a gallon of fuel to make a gallon of biofuel and still make a profit. [...] Some argue that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> distortion of the market. [...] There have been thousands of scholarly papers analyzing how much energy goes into making ethanol from corn and how that compares to the energy in the ethanol.|$|E
2500|$|On November 27, 2012, {{a federal}} judge entered an order {{granting}} preliminary approval to a proposed settlement to a class-action lawsuit filed in 2005 by merchants and trade associations against MasterCard, Visa, and many credit card issuers. The suit was filed due to price fixing and other anti-competitive trade practices employed by MasterCard and Visa. A majority of named class plaintiffs have objected and vowed {{to opt out of}} the settlement. Opponents object to provisions that would bar future lawsuits and even prevent merchants from opting out of significant portions of the proposed settlement. Stephen Neuwirth, a lawyer representing Home Depot, said, [...] "It’s so obvious Visa and MasterCard were prepared to make a large payment because of the scope of the releases being given. It’s all one quid pro quo and merchants like the Home Depot are being denied the chance to opt out of that quid pro quo and say <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> deal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Smith {{continues}} to demonstrate psychic abilities and superhuman intelligence, {{coupled with a}} childlike naïveté. [...] When Harshaw tries to explain religion to him, Smith understands the concept of God only as [...] "one who groks", which includes every extant organism. This leads him to express the Martian concept of life as the phrase [...] "Thou art God", although he knows <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> translation. Many other human concepts such as war, clothing, and jealousy are strange to him, while {{the idea of an}} afterlife is a fact he takes for granted because Martian society is directed by [...] "Old Ones", the spirits of Martians who have [...] "discorporated". It is also customary for loved ones and friends to eat the bodies of the dead, in a rite similar to Holy Communion. Eventually, Harshaw arranges freedom for Smith and recognition that human law, which would have granted ownership of Mars to Smith, has no applicability to a planet already inhabited by intelligent life.|$|E
5000|$|Diplomatic {{historian}} Margaret McMillan {{argues that}} in 1897 Britain was indeed isolated, {{but far from}} being [...] "splendid" [...] <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> thing, for Britain had no real friends and was engaged in disputes with the United States, France, Germany, and Russia.|$|R
5000|$|CNN Money {{described}} the Cimarron as [...] "in all important respects, a Chevrolet Cavalier. It also added thousands {{to the price}} tag. In all, it <b>was</b> neither <b>a</b> good Cadillac nor a good value. Today, GM executives will readily admit that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> idea." ...|$|R
25|$|In 1704 the viceroy {{suppressed}} a rebellion of the Pima Indians in Nueva Vizcaya, using bloody methods. The Indians were terrorized and submitted, {{but in the}} long run <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> result for the Spanish. The Indians became distrustful and resisted evangelization and integration into the society of the viceroyalty.|$|R
2500|$|Marc Hogan of Spin {{felt the}} mixed {{influences}} didn’t work in Swift’s favor: “A glossy soft rocker with a stomping four-on-the-floor beat, back-porch twang, adult-contemporary orchestration, and Top 40-ready electronic vocal effects, it covers a bizarre number of bases. And the key lyric compares her lost love, mourned here {{as an object}} of desire but not kissed off as one of the usual jerks, to ‘driving a new Maserati down a dead end street,’ like Swift is about to brawl with Rick Ross.” [...] Grady Smith of Entertainment Weekly, joked, saying: [...] "Those are the only colors the song — which Swift says is all about 'intense emotion' — brings up, which kind of let me down. (...) I’m being serious — I kept waiting for some other hue to pop up, and it never did.(... And then, said: [...] "Lyrically, (...) [...] lines (...) lack the crisp, powerful punch that Swift usually delivers. And in a song all about the vividness of feelings, they paint a rather blurry portrait. (...) Where is the drama, the sexiness, the freefall of passion? The poppy production white-washes over all that. That doesn’t mean <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> song, just maybe an underwhelming one." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{defendants}} had {{all changed}} their pleas to guilty, because as first time offenders they <b>were</b> granted <b>a</b> free pardon under the Indemnity and Oblivion Act of 1660. Stratmann states that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> {{piece of advice}} by the lawyers for the defendants. However, at the time, the judge refused to prosecute the three for murder as there was no body.|$|R
5000|$|David had to {{withdraw}} from the task {{at the start of the}} day, after one of his teeth broke apart while eating breakfast. Steuart tried to persuade Clint to bring David back into the boardroom anyway if the men lost, but Clint thought <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> idea, and that Trump wouldn't fire David for something that wasn't his fault.|$|R
50|$|Lord Ashburton <b>was</b> buying <b>a</b> {{property}} for £60,000 on Church Street, Kensington, London. His solicitor was Mr Nocton. Mr Nocton advised Lord Ashburton to release {{part of the}} mortgage security. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> idea, because as Mr Nocton in fact knew, {{this meant that the}} security would become insufficient. Lord Ashburton alleged the advice was not given in good faith, but rather in Mr Nocton's self-interest.|$|R
60|$|November 3.--Sea-sickness {{has pretty}} much left us, but the nights are far from voluptuous, as Lord Stowell says. After breakfast I {{established}} myself in the after-cabin {{to read and write}} as well as I can, whereof <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> specimen.|$|E

2500|$|Work on {{the game}} began in January 1996, with four programmers, two artists, and a product manager. Originally, the game was to have no music whatsoever, but {{composer}} Martin O'Donnell, who had recently been hired by Bungie, convinced the developers <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> idea, and he, Michael Salvatori and Paul Heitsch were commissioned to compose a soundtrack {{and work on the}} sound effects.|$|R
25|$|In August 2010, 67% of Americans said {{religion}} was losing influence, compared with 59% who said this in 2006. Majorities of white evangelical Protestants (79%), white mainline Protestants (67%), black Protestants (56%), Catholics (71%), and the religiously unaffiliated (62%) {{all agreed that}} {{religion was}} losing influence on American life; 53% of the total public said <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> thing, while just 10% {{see it as a}} good thing.|$|R

50|$|In 1837, it {{was decided}} that every parish should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{municipality}}, but no municipality should belong to more than one county (see formannskapsdistrikt). Sirdal parish was therefore first divided in two municipalities. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> decision because they had very few inhabitants separately. <b>A</b> new solution <b>was</b> found in 1839 when the two municipalities were re-joined together, and the county border was moved so that all of Sirdalen was in Vest-Agder county.|$|R

50|$|On the day, Labour {{retained}} its seat but its majority was slashed to just 740 votes, with the independent candidate picking {{up over a}} thousand.

6000|$|But, {{again he}} {{subsided}} into a reminiscence {{of his first}} full knowledge of his power just now, and of her disclosure of her heart.

50|$|In 464, Emperor Xiaowu died, and Liu Ziye {{took the}} throne as Emperor Qianfei. When the {{official}} Cai Xingzong (蔡興宗) offered the imperial seal to him, {{he did so}} with an arrogant and careless attitude, without any expression of sadness, and Cai commented to others that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> sign for his reign. He honored his grandmother Empress Dowager Lu as grand empress dowager, and his mother Empress Wang as empress dowager. He also posthumously honored Crown Princess He as an empress.|$|R

500|$|Through {{the middle}} and late 1950s the LPO worked with new {{conductors}} including Constantin Silvestri and Josef Krips. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> period financially for the orchestra, and it was forced to abandon fixed contracts for its players with holiday and sick pay and pensions, and revert to payment by engagement. Financial disaster was averted thanks to an anonymous benefactor, generally believed to <b>be</b> Boult. <b>A</b> historian of the orchestra, Edmund Pirouet, writes that having <b>been</b> on <b>an</b> upward curve in the 1940s, by the mid-1950s the orchestra [...] "was at best marking time".|$|R
