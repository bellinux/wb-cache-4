25|$|The first {{church was}} {{probably}} a three-aisled basilica with a large, single western tower adorned with galleries. Its transept extended beyond the main building towards the north and south. Unusually, it lacked a choir projecting towards the east, and thus was almost T-shaped, barring, possibly, a central apse or lesser apses projecting from the transept. Stylistically, this first church was similar to Romanesque churches from Westphalia and the Rhine Valley. A few details seem however to be unique. Among these is {{the arrangement of the}} <b>tower</b> <b>gallery.</b> This in turn came to inspire many more churches on Gotland, providing a rather distinct architectural style.|$|E

Space between the ceilings of existing galleries and the building's skylights (which was never completed when the building was constructed in 1978) would be renovated into two, [...] high, hexagonal <b>Tower</b> <b>Galleries.</b> The galleries would have a combined [...] of space and will be lit by skylights.
