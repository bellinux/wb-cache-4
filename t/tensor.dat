40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this chapter}} is to review {{different}} approaches that have been proposed to compute fabric <b>tensors</b> with emphasis on trabecular bone research. Fab-ric <b>tensors</b> aim at modeling through <b>tensors</b> both anisotropy and orientation of a material with respect to another one. Fabric <b>tensors</b> are widely used in fields such as trabecular bone research, mechanics of materials and geology. These <b>tensors</b> {{can be seen as}} semi-global measurements since they are computed in relatively large neighborhoods, which are assumed quasi-homogeneous. Many methods have been proposed to compute fabric <b>tensors.</b> We propose to classify fabric <b>tensors</b> into two categories: mechanics-based and morphology-based. The former computes fabric <b>tensors</b> from mechanical simulations, while the latter computes them by analyzing the morphology of the materials. In addition to pointing out advantages and draw-backs for each method, current trends and challenges in this field are also summa-rized. ...|$|R
40|$|Koutras has {{proposed}} some methods to construct reducible proper conformal Killing <b>tensors</b> and Killing <b>tensors</b> (which are, in general, irreducible) when {{a pair of}} orthogonal conformal Killing vectors exist in a given space. We give the completely general result demonstrating that this severe restriction of orthogonality is unnecessary. In addition we correct and extend some results concerning Killing <b>tensors</b> constructed from a single conformal Killing vector. A number of examples demonstrate {{how it is possible}} to construct a much larger class of reducible proper conformal Killing <b>tensors</b> and Killing <b>tensors</b> than permitted by the Koutras algorithms. In particular, by showing that all conformal Killing <b>tensors</b> are reducible in conformally at spaces, we have a method of constructing all conformal Killing <b>tensors</b> and hence all the Killing <b>tensors</b> (which will in general be irreducible) of conformally at spaces using their conformal Killing vectors...|$|R
