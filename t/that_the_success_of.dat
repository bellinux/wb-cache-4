5|$|In an {{analysis}} of its components, IHS's iSuppli estimated that the production cost of the 16GB model of the Nexus7 is $159.25 per unit, $19 more per unit than Amazon.com's competing tablet, the Kindle Fire. The Nexus7's higher production costs were attributed to its use of a higher-quality display, a quad-core processor (instead of the Fire's dual-core), and its inclusion of a camera and near field communications (NFC) functionality. The firm's senior analyst Andrew Rassweiler suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> the HP TouchPad's fire sale helped increase the commercial viability of low-cost tablets from major brands, and the failures of other high-end tablets helped {{reduce the cost of}} parts, making tablets like the Kindle Fire and Nexus7 possible. However, he also noted that both tablets were being sold at thin profit margins, primarily due to their respective ties to content services.|$|E
5|$|In chapter nine, Marita's Bargain, Gladwell {{advances}} {{the notion}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> students of different cultures or different socio-economic backgrounds {{is in fact}} highly correlated to the time students spent in school or in educationally rich environments. He describes the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) which helps students from about 50 inner-city schools across the United States achieve much better results than other inner-city schools' students and explains that their success {{stems from the fact}} that they simply spent more hours at school during the school year and the summer. Gladwell also analyzes a five-year study done by Karl Alexander of Johns Hopkins University, demonstrating that summer holidays have a detrimental effect on students of disadvantaged backgrounds, who paradoxically progress more during the school year than students from the highest socio-economic group.|$|E

5|$|Several factors {{besides the}} {{lobbying}} campaign of the United Fruit Company led the United States {{to launch the}} coup that toppled Árbenz in 1954. The US government had grown more suspicious of the Guatemalan Revolution as the Cold War developed and the Guatemalan government clashed with US corporations on {{an increasing number of}} issues. The US was also concerned that it had been infiltrated by communists although historian Richard H. Immerman argued that during {{the early part of the}} Cold War, the US and the CIA were predisposed to see the revolutionary government as communist, despite Arévalo's ban of the communist party during his 1945–1951 presidency. Additionally, the US government was concerned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> Árbenz's reforms would inspire similar movements elsewhere. Until the end of its term, the Truman administration relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the communist influence.|$|E

As of 1054, Shen began serving in minor local governmental posts. However, his natural abilities to plan, organize, and design were proven early in life; one example is his design and supervision of the hydraulic drainage of an embankment system, which converted some one hundred thousand acres (400km²) of swampland into prime farmland.

5|$|More {{extensive}} coverage {{has been given}} by some sites.

In a later feature for the same website, Thomas Whitehead said that the otherwise niche and slightly unremarkable Pandora's Tower had been granted a level of mystique and anticipation among fans through its inclusion in the Operation Rainfall campaign. In an interview feature conducted after the announcement of a North American release for Pandora's Tower, PC World noted that Operation Rainfall was going against the trend with its complete success in pushing to bring all three titles to North America. In particular, it compared them to the unsuccessful efforts by fans to bring Japan-exclusive entries of the Mother series to the West.|$|E
5|$|Pastor H.J. Pedersen, {{like most}} early pastors in the synod, had {{received}} his training in a folk school, {{and he was}} convinced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> the new congregation and colony depended on the establishment of such a Danish-speaking folk school. Danebod Folk School opened December1, 1888, with Pedersen as president. Other teachers were Carl Hansen and Christian Hansen. Among the first students were Niels Petersen and Kristian Klink, both Danish immigrants. Klink was a stonemason educated in Denmark, and he helped pastor Pedersen in building the Stone Hall. It was built of native rock. Farmers hauled rocks from the shores of Swan Lake just south of Danebod, and Klink and his helpers split and shaped the rocks. The Stone Hall was finished {{in the fall of}} 1889, and the first public gathering in the Stone Hall was at Klink's funeral in November 1889. The Stone Hall quickly became the center of the new colony, and Sunday services were conducted here, as well as numerous weddings, baptisms and funerals. The students at the Danebod Folk School used the building as a gym hall, and young people would meet here to socialize, meet up with friends, and participate in singing games. Three years later, the Stone Hall was now too small for worship services. It was decided to build a new church, and the Cross Church at Danebod was dedicated on Sunday, June16, 1895.|$|E
5|$|Kakashi's {{background}} is explored in Kakashi Gaiden, a six chapter series that divides {{the gap between}} Part I and II of the manga. Following his father's suicide, Sakumo Hatake aka the White Fang, Kakashi adopted the philosophy <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> a mission must always come first rather than comrades in contrast to his father. Kakashi is assigned by his teacher, Minato Namikaze, to lead a mission that would turn the current war in Konoha's favor. When his teammate, Rin Nohara, is captured by enemy ninja, his other teammate, Obito Uchiha, convinces him to rescue her despite the mission's ending. After finding Rin, an enemy-induced cave-in crushed Obito's right half. With his dying wish {{and the possibility of}} enemy reinforcements, Obito has Rin implant his newly acquired Sharingan into Kakashi's recently damaged eye socket as a parting gift. His new eye in place, Kakashi flees with Rin as the cave collapsed, eventually completing their mission. Shortly after this event, Kakashi has to rescue Rin again who is kidnapped by Kirigakure; however, he learns that the Kiri, under the influence of Madara Uchiha, has made Rin as the host of the Three Tails, Isobu. Rin requests Kakashi to kill her so she may not be used by the Hidden Mist ninja as part of a Trojan Horse scheme against Konoha, but Kakashi is reluctant. She eventually forces herself on the way of Kakashi's Lightning Blade that he originally directed at the pursuing Hidden Mist ninja, killing her. An anime exclusive flashback arc in Naruto Shippuden covered Kakashi coping with what he endured during the war as he becomes an ANBU operative during Minato's time as Hokage and influences Yamato into becoming a member of the ANBU as well. Once relieved of duty in the ANBU, Kakashi becomes a Genin instructor prior to the events of Part I.|$|E

5|$|The {{objective}} for the 11th as the attacking {{force was}} to capture Knollwood Army Auxiliary Airfield near Fort Bragg in North Carolina, {{after which the}} maneuver was named. The defending forces were to try to defend the airport {{and the surrounding area}} and repel the airborne assault. The entire operation would be observed by Lieutenant General McNair. His observations and reports to the U.S. War Department, and ultimately General Eisenhower, would do much to decide {{the success or failure of}} the exercise. The Knollwood Maneuver took place on the night of 7 December, with the troops of the 11th Airborne Division being delivered to thirteen separate objectives by 200 C-47 Dakota transport aircraft and 234 Waco CG-4A gliders, with eighty-five percent of the airborne troops being delivered to their target without navigational error. The transport aircraft were divided into four groups, each taking off from a different airfield in the Carolinas, with two groups dropping paratroopers and two towing gliders, and between them deployed 4,800 airborne troops in the first wave. These airborne troops then seized the Knollwood Army Auxiliary Airfield from the defending troops and secured the area in which the rest of the division landed, all before daylight. Having secured their initial objectives, the 11th Airborne Division then conducted a coordinated ground attack against a reinforced infantry regiment, as well as several aerial resupply and casualty evacuation missions in coordination with transport aircraft. The exercise was judged to be a great success by those who observed it. McNair reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> the maneuver pleased him, and highlighted the great improvements in airborne training that had occurred in the months between the end of Operation Husky and the Knollwood Maneuver. Due to the success of the units of the 11th Airborne Division during the exercise, the divisional-sized airborne force was deemed to be effective and was allowed by Eisenhower to remain.|$|E
