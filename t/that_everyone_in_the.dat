5|$|Controlling the Group helps {{individuals}} {{to learn how}} their behavior affects others. Individuals learn the difference between external control {{of the group and}} personal control of their own behavior. They learn that controlling the group is something <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> group contributes to. They learn about different techniques to influence group success. They gain skills in balancing the group's versus the individual's needs.|$|E
5|$|From early on, {{children}} also assume that language {{is designed for}} communication. Infants treat communication as a cooperative process. Specifically, infants observe the principles of conventionality and contrast. According to conventionality, infants believe that for a particular meaning that they wish to convey, there is a term <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> community would expect to be used. According to contrast, infants act according {{to the notion that}} differences in form mark differences in meaning. Children's attention to conventionality and contrast is demonstrated in their language use, even before the age of 2 years; they direct their early words towards adult targets, repair mispronunciations quickly if possible, ask for words to relate to the world around them, and maintain contrast in their own word use.|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{meets with}} each of his {{employees}} to discuss their job performance. He plunders the employee suggestion box for ideas to impress his own boss, Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), but the ruse backfires and he embarrasses himself. Michael relentlessly pesters Jan about their previous romantic connection but she bluntly rejects him, especially when, during the office's suggestion box meeting, she discovers <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Scranton branch {{is aware of the}} incident. As Jan storms out of the office, she admonishes Michael before complimenting him and reluctantly stating that she is not ready for a relationship. Meanwhile, the stunned staff listens in.|$|E

5|$|Legal {{disputes}} {{carried on}} for years, {{exacerbated by the}} fact that Marsh owned land near Van Cortlandt Park in particular. Opponents argued that building a park system would divert funds from more important infrastructure like schools and docks; <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city, instead of just the property owners near the proposed park, was required to pay taxes to pay for the parks' construction; and that since Marsh was trying to parcel off some of his land to developers, the park's size should be reduced in order to prevent him from profiting off park usage. However, most of this opposition was directed at the construction of Pelham Bay Park, which was then in Westchester. Supporters argued that the parks were for the benefit of all the city's citizens, thus justifying the citywide park tax; that the value of properties near the parks would appreciate greatly over time; that the Commission had only chosen property that could easily be converted into a park; and that Pelham Bay Park would soon be annexed to the city. Ultimately, the parks were established despite the objections of major figures like Mayors William Russell Grace and Abram Hewitt; Comptroller Edward V. Loew; and Assemblymen Henry Bergh and Theodore Roosevelt.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{explanation of}} the sexual division of labor finds that males and females cooperate within pair bonds by targeting different foods so <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> household benefits. Females may target foods that do not conflict with reproduction and child care, while males will target foods that females do not gather, which will reduce variance in daily consumption and provide a broader diet for the family. Foraging specialization in particular food groups should increase skill level and thus foraging success rates for targeted foods.|$|E

Pookolam, a form of art that uses coloured flour to create patterns and designs, comes from Kerala, but can be seen in abundance at the time of Onam.|$|E
25|$|According to tradition, when Muhammad {{was either}} nine or twelve years old, {{he went with}} his uncle Abu Talib on a {{business}} journey to Syria. There he met Bahira {{in the town of}} Bosra. When the caravan was passing by his cell, the monk invited the merchants to a feast. They accepted the invitation, leaving the boy to guard the camel. Bahira, however, insisted <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> caravan should come to him. Then a miraculous occurrence indicated to the monk that Muhammad was to become a prophet. According to one version, those were the stigmata that Bahira found on young Muhammad. Other variants of the story say that it was a miraculous movement of a cloud or an unusual behavior of a branch that kept shadowing Muhammad regardless of the time of the day. The monk revealed his visions of Muhammad's future to the boy's companion, warning him to preserve the child from the Jews (in Ibn Sa'd's version) or from the Byzantines (in al-Tabari's version).|$|E

500|$|Northern {{and central}} Sudan had been {{nominally}} under Egyptian suzerainty since an Ottoman force had conquered and occupied {{the region in}} 1821. The primary motive was not territorial conquest but to secure a source of slaves {{to serve in the}} Egyptian army. The slaves, paid in lieu of taxes, were brought from the formerly inaccessible regions of south Sudan. When the British explorer Samuel Baker visited Khartoum in 1862, he found <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town was involved in the slave trade, including the Governor-General. The Egyptian and Nubian garrison lived on the land like an army of occupation. Bribery {{was the only way to}} get anything done. Torture and floggings were routine in the prisons.

[...] The Simpsons showrunner Mike Scully also noted that future Bart is {{the kind of person who}} is [...] "always waiting for some big sort of cash payoff that he feels he's owed whether it be an insurance settlement, an inheritance, or something that's gonna come sooner or later."

Rick Berman stated in an early memo that the new series was intended to be an issues-based show in the same mold as the original. Creator Gene Roddenberry concurred, and under questioning from fans at a convention which Gerrold also attended, Roddenberry agreed {{that it was time for}} a homosexual character to appear in Star Trek. Roddenberry told his staff that [...] "Times have changed and we have got to be aware of it." [...] This resulted in Gerrold pitching a story called [...] "", which included two homosexual crew members and an AIDS allegory.

Since it is unfair to assume <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> working <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of phase noise estimation is acquainted with Monte Carlo methods, we devote an entire and relatively large section of this paper {{to the introduction of}} Monte Carlo methods and sequential importance sampling in particular (Section 4). <b>The</b> framework presented <b>in</b> Section 4 is thereafter applied to the phase noise problem for uncoded and coded systems in Sections 5 and 6, respectively. Finally, Section 7 provides numerical results and Section 8 wraps up the paper.|$|R
