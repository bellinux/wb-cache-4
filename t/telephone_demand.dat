It is the first to estimate low-income <b>telephone</b> <b>demand</b> across demographic groups using location-specific Lifeline and Linkup prices. The demand specifications use a discrete choice model aggregated across demographic groups. GMM estimators correct for the possible endogeneity of subsidized prices. A simulation predicts low-income telephone penetration would be 4. 1 percentage points lower without Lifeline and Linkup. Results suggest that Linkup is more cost-effective than Lifeline, and that automatic enrollment in the programs increases penetration. telephone subsidies, low-income telephone usuers...|$|E

A generalized additive Tobit model of residential local long distance (intra-LATA) <b>telephone</b> <b>demand</b> is estimated on {{a cross-section of}} residential telephone consumers across twenty-eight states. While past studies of telecommunications demand have used fully parametric models, the model presented here is non-parametric in two dimensions: first no distributional assumption is made for the error distribution, and second, the demand equation is non-parametric with respect to price. We find that the elasticity of demand is substantially lower (in absolute value) that found in previous studies for a 40 % cut in tariffs.

40|$|Although {{telephone}} pricing {{has received}} increasing attention in recent years, the geographic patterns of telephone pricing {{and the corresponding}} economic consequences of those patterns have remained perplexing to consumers and policymakers and largely unaddressed by economists. In this article we first specify {{a model of the}} demand for short (intraLATA) long distance calling. We then draw upon data made available by the recent adoption of extended area service (EAS) in four metropolitan areas to empirically measure the structure of inter-exchange <b>telephone</b> <b>demand.</b> Given these estimates, and a conceptual framework for analyzing the economic welfare effects, we were able to quantify the consumer-surplus effects of alternative pricing policies. The empirical results indicate that consumer surplus is noticeably enhanced by adopting EAS. But the net economic welfare effects are shown to be sensitive to, among other things, the level of price-cost margins prevailing prior to the implementation of EAS. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this {{research}} is to investigate quantitatively telephone tariff rebalancing policy in the European common market of 1992. The focus is on the analysis of regional disparities in telephone penetration in Europe and on the effects of the proposed tariff restructuring on telephone universal service. The work is organized into three essays. The first essay concentrates on the analysis of regional variations in residential demand for access to telephones in Italy. Using micro-data, a random utility model is estimated for Italian residential demand for telephone access and is used to assess how economic, demographic and local calling area characteristics affect the probability of household subscription to telephone service. The results clearly show that regional imbalances in penetration are of primary importance and lead to the recommendation of a by country, flexible approach to tariff rebalancing. The second essay is an estimation of <b>telephone</b> <b>demand</b> cross-elasticties in Europe. Using a demand demand system of two equations (access and usage) and panel data for 9 European countries over 9 years. These estimates suggest that the cross-elasticities between access price and demand for usage are inversely related to the rate of telephone penetration and that they have a greater effect on usage demand than direct elasticities. In the final essay, general conclusions from the empirical results of the two essays are expanded on in order to suggest policy applications for European tariff policy and universal service. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{reliable}} and wideband telecommunication network {{is a vital}} infrastructure development, where wide band services such as ATM, ADSL and IP based services could be supported. In Sri Lanka, the requirement {{of this kind of}} an optical network is very significant as other operators also can share the capacity of the network for transporting their traffic. On the other hand the network problems such as excessive BER (Bit Error Rate) etc are experienced after its construction. In order to avoid such limitations in the network, the network needs to be modeled on appropriate software tools and run with designed network parameters, so that the desired BER could be ensured. During the initial phase of the study, the total <b>telephone</b> <b>demand</b> by year 20 If was estimated as nearly 2 million subscribers. This was estimated through the world trend for telephone subscribers together with economic indicators such as GNP and GDP. The Nodes of the Network was determined based on the present distribution of customers in the County. In this case all the Tertiary Switching Center areas and the Secondary Center Areas where the customer base is more than 2. 5 % of total customers were taken as the main nodes of the network. In addition Jaffna and Baticaloa were also taken as nodes considering the potential growth of traffic in northern and eastern parts of the Island. The Gravity model and Earlang's E formula, traffic tables, were used to find the traffic between nodes and the number of circuits between nodes. Based on the traffic distribution between nodes, a part of the network was proposed as a fully reliable Ring Network, while other nodes are connected through extended links. The IP traffic, which is thought to be the major traffic flow in the future, were estimated considering the broadband Internet growth in the country. Also the traffic, which are expected to be migrated from traditional PSTN to IP Network were identified and estimated to find the total bandwidth requirement of the network by year 2015 The number of wavelengths in the proposed Network were decided based on the final bandwidth requirement. This resulted an island wide network consisting of WDM Ring Network having 08 wavelengths that basically covers {{the southern part of the}} country and two other extensions having a wavelength each to northern and eastern parts of the country. The Colombo and the Kandy nodes were selected as Full Fiber Terminal Stations as most of the traffic flow between these two nodes. Wavelengths are added and dropped at each branch station based on the traffic volumes between these nodes. The wavelengths were selected such that the. space between adjacent wavelengths is 0. 8 rm to avoid nonlinear effects and cross talks.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop and estimate demand models for residential telephone network subscription and calling demands, where the household is the basic decision unit. The analysis assumes that households consider the subscription-calling rate structure in determining the household <b>telephone</b> service <b>demands</b> and that the demands are conditioned by the socio-demographic characteristics of the household. Model estimation requires household network subscription and calling data under different rate structures. Because alterations to the subscription-calling rate structure are both infrequent and small in magnitude, stated-preference experimental design methods are employed as an alternative data source. The household's subscription probability is assumed logit while the calling demand equations are assumed a seemingly unrelated system. The model is estimated by continuous/discrete econometric methods. Estimates of the parameters are provided for the economic variables and socio-demographic variables specifications of the model for the Sydney Metropolitan Area, Penrith and New South Wales Country regions. The estimates indicate that both the household network subscription and calling demands are affected by the rate structure and household socio-demographic variables. Base and hypothetical rate structure scenario simulations for the Sydney Metropolitan Area show that rate structures substantially impact on quarterly household telephone communication expenditures...|$|R
40|$|The {{liberalisation}} of the telecommunication {{sector has}} dispossessed regulators {{from the use}} of cross-subsidisation in order to achieve the universality goal. In a liberalised context, special tariff schemes represent one possible policy tool in order to increase the penetration rate. This paper focuses on the UK fixed home telephone network and analyses LUS and InContact tariff schemes adopted by British Telecom (BT) in the 1990 s. Both schemes turned out to yield unsatisfactory results. This paper, after reviewing past literature on <b>telephone</b> access <b>demand,</b> uses an econometric approach to test whether such schemes were properly targeted to suit the characteristics of "un-phoned" households. The empirical analysis points out that some important socio-economic factors, rather than simply low income, are the major drivers of non-connection. The failure to take into account these and other factors discussed in the paper, has significantly contributed to the poor results of the two special tariff schemes. In this context the UK experience provides a useful basis for discussion on the validity of policies aimed at promoting network good adoption via the introduction of special tariff schemes.
