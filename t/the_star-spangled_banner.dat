5|$|The Baltimore Beltway {{was first}} planned in 1949 by Baltimore County; the state {{eventually}} {{took over the}} project and it {{became part of the}} Interstate Highway System planned in 1956. The length of the route from MD 2 south of Baltimore clockwise to U.S. Route 40 (US40) northeast of the city opened in stages from 1955 to 1962, providing an Interstate bypass of Baltimore. It was the first beltway in the United States to be built as part of the Interstate Highway System. Plans were made to finish the remainder of the route, with a diversion to the Windlass Freeway and the Patapsco Freeway, opened in 1973, following the cancellation of a more outer route that was to partly follow what is today MD702 (Southeast Boulevard). The Outer Harbor Crossing over the Patapsco River, which was dedicated to Francis Scott Key, who wrote <b>The</b> <b>Star-Spangled</b> <b>Banner,</b> and its approaches were finished in 1977, completing the route around Baltimore. The approaches to the bridge were originally two lanes to accommodate a tunnel that was originally proposed to run under the river; in subsequent years, they were upgraded to a four-lane configuration compliant with Interstate Highway standards, allowing for this portion of route to be signed as I-695 rather than MD695. There are future plans for I-695 that include high-occupancy toll lanes to ease traffic. In addition, the northeastern interchange with I-95 has been reconstructed to accommodate express toll lanes that were added to I-95 (completed in 2014, but construction is in progress in 2016 to remove I-695's carriageway crossovers here).|$|E

William Sidis was arrested. Later a mob attacked the Socialist headquarters. Police arrested 114, all from the Socialist side.

25|$|The Morgan State University Choir {{is one of}} the nation’s {{most prestigious}} {{university}} choral ensembles and was led {{for more than three decades}} by the late Dr. Nathan Carter, celebrated conductor, composer, and arranger. The groups that are subdivisions of the critically acclaimed choir include the University Choir, which is over 140 voices strong, and The Morgan Singers (approximately 40 voices). While classical, gospel, and contemporary popular music comprise the majority of the choir’s repertoire, the choir is noted for its emphasis on preserving the heritage of the spiritual, especially in the historic practices of performance. The Morgan State University Choir has performed for audiences throughout the United States and all over the world—including The Bahamas, Virgin Islands, Canary Islands, Canada, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Their most recent international appearance was in Saint Petersburg, Russia, at the invitation of Maestro Yuri Temirkanov, music director and conductor for the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. In Russia, the Choir performed in the 5th International Festival Arts Square and was received enthusiastically by their Russian audiences. The Choir has appeared at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., and at the Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall in New York City on numerous occasions, performing and premiering works such as John Corigliano’s “Poem On His Birthday,” “Too Hot to Handel” arranged by Broadway composers Bob Christianson and Gary Anderson and Hannibal Lokumbe’s “African Portraits”, led by music director Leonard Slatkin, as part of the Kennedy Center’s African Festival. One of the Choir’s most historic moments came with the opportunity to sing under the baton of Robert Shaw, conducting the Orchestra of St. Luke's and joined by Jessye Norman and others in Carnegie Hall’s One Hundredth Birthday Tribute to Marian Anderson. A major milestone and historical movement occurred during the 1996–1997 season with the sounds of the “Silver Anniversary” concert being broadcast into households throughout the state of Maryland. The concert won three Emmy Awards for Maryland Public Television (MPT). MPT continues to air this hallmark performance during select sections of their membership drives.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the feasibility and desirability of designating the routes used by the British and Americans during the 1814 Chesapeake Campaign of the War of 1812 as a National Historic Trail (NHT) under the study provisions of the National Trails System Act (Public Law 90 - 543, 16 USC 1241, et seq.). This report is intended to provide information necessary for the evaluation of national significance and the potential designation of a NHT. The proposed NHT would commemorate the Chesapeake Campaign of the War of 1812, which includes the British invasion of Maryland, Battle of Bladensburg, burning of the White House and the Capitol, and the Battle for Baltimore in the summer of 1814. Eight potential land and water trail segments trace the historic routes of the British and American forces and the battles that inspired the writing of the poem that became the National Anthem. The routes taken by President Madison and the First Lady when fleeing Washington, the route to move important national documents to safety, and the route taken by the American forces to defend Baltimore are also studied and analyzed.
