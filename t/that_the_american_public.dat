He also believed that, though publications should discuss political topics, they should not express party opinions or choose sides. The Mirror flourished {{at a time when many}} publications were discontinuing. Its success was due to the shrewd management of Willis and Morris and the two demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> could support literary endeavors. Willis was becoming an expert in American literature and so, in 1845, Willis and Morris issued an anthology, The Prose and Poetry of America.|$|E

This study examines the dynamics of climate change “contrarianism ” in <b>the</b> <b>American</b> context by analyzing the content of major conservative think tanks on the issue from the mid 1990 s to the present. Specifically, we rely on an unsupervised text classification algo-rithm to produce time series measures of climate skepticism.

500|$|On August 28, 1944, Arnold made Hansell {{commander}} of the XXI Bomber Command, despite misgivings among several senior leaders that while a superb staff officer, {{he did not have}} the [...] "temperament" [...] to be a combat commander. Aware of Arnold’s legendary impatience, deputy AAF commander General Barney Giles, who was doubtful that Hansell could accomplish the task given him—setting up an effective air campaign in a brief period using an untried aircraft—obtained a commitment from Arnold that he would not relieve Hansell in only a few months. [...] However Hansell’s tenure was threatened from the start because his replacement on the Air Staff, Major General Lauris Norstad, did not support the concept of daylight precision bombing, instead advocating massive destruction of Japanese cities by firebombing, a tactic that had been promoted in AAF planning circles as early as November 1943. Fire raids on Japan were rapidly gaining widespread acceptance among AAF leaders, including Arnold, both to defeat Japan before an invasion was mounted and to satisfy a perception <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> wanted revenge for three bloody years of war. Hansell, however, opposed the tactic as both morally repugnant and militarily unnecessary.|$|E

Prior to 1920, home runs were unusual, and managers tried to win games {{by getting a}} runner on base and bringing him around to score through such means as the stolen base, the bunt, and the hit and run. Advocates of what was dubbed [...] "inside baseball", such as Giants manager McGraw, disliked the home run, considering it a blot on {{the purity of the}} game. According to sportswriter W. A. Phelon, after the 1920 season, Ruth's breakout performance that season and the response in excitement and attendance, [...] "settled, for all time to come, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> is nuttier over the Home Run than the Clever Fielding or the Hitless Pitching. Viva el Home Run and two times viva Babe Ruth, exponent of the home run, and overshadowing star." [...] Bill James noted, [...] "When the owners discovered that the fans liked to see home runs, and when the foundations of the games were simultaneously imperiled by disgrace , then there was no turning back." [...] While a few, such as McGraw and Cobb, decried the passing of the old-style play, teams quickly began to seek and develop sluggers.|$|E
500|$|The band {{returned}} to the studio, this time at Vanguard Studios in New York City, between July and September 1967. When [...] "Superbird", a tune mocking President Lyndon Johnson, was not banned from radio promotion, the band was given the go-ahead to record [...] "The Fish Cheer", which saw the group {{moving away from the}} original folk composition toward electric instrumentals more synthesized toward psychedelia. The song became the title track of the band's second album, I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die, released in November 1967. The album was not as successful as its predecessor, but still charted at number 67. The composition represented growing anti-war sentiment expressed by those opposing the Vietnam War, and is often {{considered one of the most}} recognized and celebrated protest songs of the era. [...] "The Fish Cheer" [...] was also pivotal in communicating the attitude against the war, but was set apart from other anti-war songs for its use of sarcastic humor and satire on the controversial conflict. Writer Lee Andresen reflects on the song's meaning, saying, [...] "the happy beat and insouciance of the vocalist are in odd juxtaposition to the lyrics that reinforce the sad fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> was being forced into realizing that Vietnam was no longer a remote place on the other side of the world, and the damage it was doing to the country could no longer be considered collateral, involving someone else." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{events of}} 9 / 11 {{set in motion}} a massive {{reordering}} of U. S. policy. We propose <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public’s</b> response to this redirection in policy derives, in part, from ethnocentrism. Ethnocentrism—“prejudice, broadly conceived”— refers to the commonplace human tendency to partition the social world into virtuous ingroups and nefarious outgroups. Support for the war on terrorism, undertaken against a strange and shadowy enemy, should hold special appeal for Americans with an ethnocentric turn of mind. To see if this is so, we analyze the panel component of the 2000 – 2002 National Election Study. We find that ethnocentrism powerfully underwrites support for the war on terrorism, across a variety of tests and specifications, and the strength of the relationship between ethnocentrism and opinion is influenced in part by the extraordinary events of 9 / 11. Ethnocentrism is easily found among Americans, but its relevance and potency for politics depends, we suggest, upon circumstance.

Although this song was not on music charts probably because it was too radical, it was performed at many public events including the famous Woodstock music festival (1969).

6000|$|After {{a display}} of much {{principle}} and dignity {{in the early days}} of the Council of Ten, he discovered that there were certain very important points in the program of his French, British, or Italian colleague, as the case might be, of which he was incapable of securing the surrender by the methods of secret diplomacy. What then was he to do in the last resort? He could let the Conference drag on an endless length by the exercise of sheer obstinacy. He could break it up and return to America in a rage with nothing settled. Or he could attempt an appeal to the world over the heads of the Conference. These were wretched alternatives, against each of which a great deal could be said. They were also very risky,--especially for a politician. The President's mistaken policy over the Congressional election had weakened his personal position in his own country, and it was by no means certain <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> would support him in a position of intransigeancy. It would mean a campaign in which the issues would be clouded by every sort of personal and party consideration, and who could say if right would triumph in a struggle which would certainly not be decided on its merits? Besides, any open rupture with his colleagues would certainly bring upon his head the blind passions of [...] "anti-German" [...] resentment with which the public of all allied countries were still inspired. They would not listen to his arguments. They would not be cool enough to treat the issue as one of international morality or of the right governance of Europe. The cry would simply be that, for various sinister and selfish reasons, the President wished [...] "to let the Hun off." [...] The almost unanimous voice of the French and British Press could be anticipated. Thus, if he threw down the gage publicly he might be defeated. And if he were defeated, would not the final Peace be far worse than if he were to retain his prestige and endeavor to make it as good as the limiting conditions of European politics would allow, him? But above all, if he were defeated, would he not lose the League of Nations? And was not this, after all, by far the most important issue for the future happiness of the world? The Treaty would be altered and softened by time. Much in it which now seemed so vital would become trifling, and much which was impracticable would for that very reason never happen. But the League, even in an imperfect form, was permanent; it was the first commencement of a new principle in the government of the world; Truth and Justice in international relations could not be established in a few months,--they must be born in due course by the slow gestation of the League. Clemenceau had been clever enough to let it be seen that he would swallow the League at a price.|$|E
