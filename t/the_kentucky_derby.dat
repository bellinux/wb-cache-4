5|$|Shackleford {{was placed}} into {{training}} with Dale Romans, who raced the colt twice as a 2-year-old. As a 3-year-old, {{he had three}} races, including the Florida Derby, where he finished second and qualified for <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby.</b> In <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby</b> he finished fourth, and then, at 13-1 odds, {{went on to win}} the Preakness Stakes on May 21, 2011. In doing so, Shackleford became the beneficiary of the largest payoff purse in Preakness history, winning not only the $600,000 winner's purse, but also $550,000 as the XpressBet Bonus winner for a total payout of $1,150,000. He was retired in 2012 after winning the Clark Handicap in November and currently stands at Darby Dan Farm.|$|E

5|$|Statistically, {{fewer than}} 50% of all race horses ever win a race, {{and less than}} 1% ever win a stakes race such as <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby</b> or The Derby. Any horse who has yet to win a race {{is known as a}} maiden.|$|E
5|$|There {{was much}} {{speculation}} {{going into the}} Stakes over Secretariat's bid for the Triple Crown. Since 1948, when Citation achieved the feat, there had been six horses that had won both <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby</b> and the Preakness Stakes before failing in the Belmont Stakes. When comparing Secretariat to those six horses' health and fitness before the Belmont Stakes, writer Bonifice felt Secretariat {{was in the best}} shape, almost as good as when he entered <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby</b> weeks prior. Just days before the Belmont, Secretariat ran five furlongs in just under a minute in a morning workout. Following that, Secretariat's jockey Ron Turcotte told reporters that Secretariat was ready for a top charge on Saturday.|$|E
5|$|The {{victory in}} the Stakes, when {{combined}} with Secretariat's previous victories in <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby</b> and the Preakness Stakes, meant he completed the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing. This was significant as he was the ninth horse to complete the feat and broke a 25-year drought where a horse failed to complete the achievement.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> 2015 <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby,</b> won by American Pharoah, Nakatani was {{the jockey}} of Frammento, which placed 15th. Weeks earlier, the jockey had broken his {{collarbone}} in a March 17 spill at Santa Anita. In <b>the</b> 2014 <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby,</b> he finished sixth on Dance With Fate.|$|R

5|$|Tristan’s sire Hermit won The Derby in 1867 {{and became}} an outstandingly {{successful}} stallion, being Champion Sire for seven successive years. In addition to Tristan, he sired the Derby winners Shotover and St. Blaise, as well as St. Marguerite (1000 Guineas), Lonely (Oaks), and Thebais (1000 Guineas & Oaks). Tristan's dam Thrift was an influential broodmare whose direct descendants included the Australian champion Poseidon, <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby</b> winner George Smith and The Derby winner Reference Point.|$|E
5|$|Between <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby</b> and the Preakness, Mr. Prospector, Cup Bearer, Ecole Etage, Champagne Charlie, and Step Nicely, none of {{whom had}} run in the Derby, were all named as {{possible}} entrants. Three horses, Secretariat, Sham, and Our Native, all raced in <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby</b> two weeks prior. On May 15, seven owners confirmed their intentions to enter their horses by paying a US$1,000 deposit. The horses officially registered that day were Our Native, Secretariat, and Sham, along with new runners Deadly Dream, Ecole Etage, The Lark Twist, and Torsion. A day later, Deadly Dream's trainer stated that he was unsure about racing his colt because he felt the horse could not match Secretariat, Sham, or Our Native. In addition, The Lark Twist's owner Larry Boyce scratched his horse from the race because he received word that Our Native registered, dropping {{the total number of}} horses competing to six. However, on the 17th, Boyce attempted to re-enter The Lark Twist, but was denied under the Rules of Racing of Maryland which stated that the scratching of a horse was irreversible. An Associated Press article commented that the credentials of Secretariat and Sham could lead to the running being one of the smallest since 1964.|$|E
5|$|After Oxbow's maiden win, he {{was flown}} to Hollywood Park in California {{to run in}} the Grade I CashCall Futurity at a mile and one-sixteenth (1,700m) on a {{synthetic}} surface. He was the longest shot in the field at 61–1, and drew the far outside post at number eleven. Ridden by Corey Nakatani, his fifth jockey in five races, Oxbow broke well coming out the gate. He ran close to the front throughout the race, despite losing ground by being four horses wide around the first turn and three wide around the final turn. Oxbow finished fourth, nine lengths back, but earned his first Road to <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby</b> point, and a speed figure of 87.|$|E

5|$|Two {{weeks after}} winning <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby,</b> American Pharoah entered the second {{leg of the}} Triple Crown, the 2015 Preakness Stakes, run over {{nine and a half}} furlongs at Pimlico Race Course. Despite an {{unfavorable}} inside draw of the number one post position, he was installed as the morning line favorite ahead of Firing Line and Dortmund. No horse had won the Preakness starting from the rail since 1994. Immediately before post time, the weather changed to a heavy downpour with thunder. The last time the Preakness had been run on a sloppy track was in 1983, and American Pharoah was the only horse in the field to have previously faced similar conditions, having won the Rebel Stakes running in rain and mud.|$|E
5|$|While {{generally}} {{successful with}} his race horses, Zayat's goal of winning <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby</b> eluded him several times, including three second-place finishes, until his win with American Pharoah. He also filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in 2010 when a bank called a note due {{and tried to}} foreclose on his horses. Zayat Stables successfully completed its Chapter 11 reorganization, but Zayat was next plagued by legal issues related to his penchant for betting {{large sums of money}} on horse racing. Nonetheless, Zayat generated considerable positive publicity on social media for his efforts to save his racehorse Paynter from life-threatening health problems, a successful struggle that earned the colt the 2012 NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award.|$|E
5|$|American Pharoah's {{connections}} {{drew the}} number five post {{position for the}} Belmont on June 3. Pundits immediately noted {{it was the same}} slot from which Seattle Slew had won the 1977 Belmont and the Triple Crown, and that 14 other Belmont winners had started from the position. American Pharoah was the 3–5 morning line favorite in an eight-horse field that included Tale of Verve, as well as five rivals from <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby</b> who had skipped the Preakness, and one horse, Madefromlucky, who had not run either of the previous Triple Crown races, but, like Tonalist the year prior, had instead won the Peter Pan Stakes at Belmont Park. American Pharoah had previously defeated every horse entered, but he was also the only horse to contest all three legs of the Triple Crown and had run four races in the preceding eight weeks.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, Schwarzkopf {{published}} a memoir, It Doesn't Take a Hero, about his life; {{it became a}} bestseller. Schwarzkopf sold the rights to his memoirs to Bantam Books for $5,000,000. In 1993, Schwarzkopf {{was found to have}} prostate cancer, for which he was successfully treated. Among the many honors he received was the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2002. Queen Elizabeth II honorarily knighted Schwarzkopf and he was awarded many other military accolades from foreign countries. He led the Pegasus Parade at <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby</b> and was an honorary guest at the Indianapolis 500. He supported several children's charities and national philanthropic causes, and he was a spokesperson for prostate cancer awareness, recovery of the grizzly bear from endangered species status, and served on the Nature Conservancy board of governors. Schwarzkopf otherwise sought to live out a low-profile retirement in Tampa, though he briefly served as a military commentator for NBC.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Zayat Stables' horses Bodemeister {{and then}} Paynter ran second {{in each of}} the three legs of the Triple Crown. Bodemeister {{finished}} a narrow second place in both <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby</b> and Preakness Stakes to I'll Have Another. Switching horses in the 2012 Belmont Stakes, Zayat's colt Paynter also finished second. Paynter went on to win the Grade I Haskell Invitational but shortly thereafter developed near-fatal complications from colitis and laminitis. Zayat authorized the highest quality of care for the horse, and following abdominal surgery and several months of rehabilitation, Paynter successfully returned to racing in 2013. After Zayat and his son Justin began making regular social media updates on Twitter with the hashtag #PowerUpPaynter, the horse developed a significant fan base, and received hundreds of get well cards, many from children. For his struggle to return to health, Paynter won NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award.|$|E
5|$|On May 2, American Pharoah {{started as}} the 2.9–1 {{favorite}} in an eighteen-runner {{field for the}} 141st running of <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby</b> at Churchill Downs. His opponents included Dortmund, winner of the Santa Anita Derby; Carpe Diem, who won the Breeders' Futurity Stakes and Blue Grass Stakes; Firing Line, winner of the Sunland Derby; Wood Memorial winner Frosted; Florida Derby winner Materiality; international entry Mubtaahij, who earned his way to Kentucky with a win in the UAE Derby; and Upstart, winner of the Holy Bull Stakes. The crowd surrounding the horse during the walk-over from the barns to the paddock upset American Pharoah, and several grooms were required to keep him under control. He continued to misbehave until he was loaded into the starting gate; his connections and supporters worried that he was using up energy he needed for the race.|$|E

5|$|Secretariat was {{inducted}} into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1974, the year following his Triple Crown victory. Also in 1974, Paul Mellon commissioned a bronze statue, sometimes known as Secretariat in Full Stride, from John Skeaping. The life-size statue remained {{in the center of the}} walking ring at Belmont Park until 1988 when it was replaced by a replica. The original is now located at the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. The Kentucky Horse Park has two other life-sized statues of Secretariat. The first, created by Jim Reno in 1992, shows Secretariat as an older sire, while the second, completed by Edwin Bogucki in 2004, shows him being led into the winner's circle after <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby.</b> In 2015, a new statue of Secretariat and Ron Turcotte crossing the finish line at the Belmont Stakes was unveiled in Grand Falls, New Brunswick, Turcotte's hometown.|$|E
5|$|Oxbow {{was moved}} {{with the rest}} of Lukas' horses to winter {{headquarters}} at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas. He started his Triple Crown prep season on January 19, 2013, with a win at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans in the mile and 70-yard (1,672 m) Grade III Lecomte Stakes. Ridden for the second time by Jon Court, he went off as the fourth choice at 5–1 and had a favorable number four post position. He came out of the gate quickly and was the front-runner throughout the race. At the top of the homestretch, he was only a half length in front of the field, but then he drew away and won by more than eleven and a half lengths. Horses he beat that day included Golden Soul, who later placed second in <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby,</b> and I've Struck a Nerve, who Oxbow faced again later in the Risen Star Stakes. He earned a speed figure of 94 and an additional ten points towards qualification for the Derby. That month, Lukas also contacted veteran Hall of Fame jockey Gary Stevens, who had just returned to racing after a seven-year retirement, and discussed having Stevens ride Oxbow in future races.|$|E
5|$|Secretariat, Sham, Pvt. Smiles, and My Gallant {{were the}} first four horses to be entered into the Belmont Stakes. Secretariat, winner of both <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby</b> and the Preakness Stakes, was the odds on {{favorite}} to win the event. The added distance of the Belmont {{when compared to the}} Derby and Preakness was found to be one potential reason for Secretariat to lose the race. Steve Cady of the New York Times wrote that Secretariat could be defeated if the pace of the race went too fast or was too slow for too long, in both of which scenarios he felt Sham would win. Sham received significant attention as well and was thought to be the second best horse, along with having the potential of becoming the first horse to be runner-up in all the Triple Crown races. My Gallant was considered the best of the rest, especially as he was the progeny of Gallant Man, who set the Belmont Stakes course record of 2: in the 1957 edition.|$|E
