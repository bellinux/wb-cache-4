5000|$|A GTFS feed is a {{collection}} of at least six, and up to 13 CSV files (with extension [...]txt) contained within a [...]zip file. Preferred character encoding is UTF-8.

In contrast to European <b>transit</b> industry <b>exchange</b> standards such as Transmodel or VDV-45X, GTFS only includes scheduled operations that are meant to be distributed to riders.

40|$|The optimal {{energy control}} and {{management}} for smart grids as per {{virtual power plant}} concepts is of great importance for the coming future of the electricity grid and the energy market.
