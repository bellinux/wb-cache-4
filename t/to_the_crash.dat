5|$|Hundreds of {{emergency}} personnel responded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> site and helped save victims. Many {{of those who}} survived were severely injured and required months or years to physically recover. NTSB investigators looked at various factors that contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash.</b> The failures of the flight crew were cited as the probable cause of the crash, but the weather, air traffic controller performances, and FAA traffic management were also cited as contributing to the {{events that led to}} the accident. This conclusion was controversial, with disagreement between investigators, passengers, and Avianca as to who was ultimately responsible. Eventually, the U.S. government joined with Avianca and settled to pay for the damages to the victims and their families. The crash was also portrayed in a variety of media.|$|E
5|$|More than 5,000 Brazilians marched <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> site on July 29, 2007, blaming their government's {{failure to}} invest in airport {{infrastructure}} for the crash. Many of the protesters also demanded the ousting of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.|$|E

5|$|On 19 May 1995, Pellerin {{pleaded guilty}} at a USAF court-martial {{proceeding}} to {{two counts of}} dereliction of duty for his actions, or lack thereof, that contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash.</b> He was sentenced to forfeit $1,500 of salary a month for five months and received a written reprimand. The USAF did not reveal whether any other officer involved {{in the chain of}} events leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> received any type of administrative or disciplinary action. Critics of USAF's safety record stated that this crash was an example of a pattern of problems related to enforcement of safety procedures within USAF.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB sent a team <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> site to {{investigate}} the accident. They concluded that, unknown to the crew, ice had collected on the wings, which disrupted airflow and reduced lift.The inquiry lasted just under one year.|$|E

5|$|The AFR 110-14 {{investigation}} {{identified several}} factors which contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash,</b> including the actual crash sequence, the personality and earlier behavior of Bud Holland, previous supervision {{and lack of}} corrective action exercised by USAF officers over Bud Holland, mission planning and execution, and other environmental and human factors.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian airport {{administrator}} Infraero {{at first}} indicated {{the possibility of}} five survivors, but a later statement from the Brazilian Air Force, based on data collected by BAF personnel who rappelled (abseiled) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> site and local police who assisted in the SAR effort, confirmed {{that there were no}} survivors. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva declared three days of national mourning.|$|E

5|$|Witnesses <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> were in {{universal}} {{agreement that}} the aircraft had not struck any foreign objects on the runway. Also, no pieces of the wing or other aircraft components were found with the separated engine, other than its supporting pylon, leading investigators to conclude that nothing else had broken free of the airframe and struck the engine. Hence the engine/pylon assembly separation could only have resulted from a structural failure.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York heard a large aircraft flying low over the area. The aircraft seemed to be in trouble because the noise from the engines was changing significantly. At times the engines seemed to be operating normally but on at least one occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief time and then returned as a very loud, high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could hear a rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> could then see the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|E
5|$|As {{each piece}} of {{wreckage}} was brought in, it was carefully cleaned with fresh water, sorted, and weighed. The item was then placed in a specific area of a hangar at CFB Shearwater, based on a grid system representing the various sections of the plane. All items not considered significant <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> were stored with similar items in large boxes. When a box was full, it was weighed {{and moved to a}} custom-built temporary structure (J-Hangar) on a discontinued runway for long-term storage. If deemed significant to the investigation, the item was documented, photographed, and kept in the active examination hangar. Particular attention was paid to any item showing heat damage, burns, or other unusual marks.|$|E

5|$|Danielle Rousseau is {{a fictional}} {{character}} on the ABC drama television series Lost, which chronicles {{the lives of}} over forty people after their plane crashes on a remote island somewhere in the South Pacific. Croatian actress Mira Furlan plays the scientist who shipwrecks on the island sixteen years prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> of Oceanic Flight 815. After Rousseau is killed in the fourth season, the American actress Melissa Farman portrayed a younger version of the character in the fifth season. Furlan later reappears for one episode in the sixth season. Rousseau is a recurring on-island character who has appeared in nineteen episodes in seasons one through four, {{as well as one}} episode where her voice alone is heard, and her final episode in the sixth season.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{celebrate}} Scully's birthday. They are {{approached by}} a woman named Sharon Graffia, who claims to be Max's sister; she tells them that Max planned to deliver something to Mulder, but that his flight to Washington has crashed. The agents head <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> site in Northville, New York, and attend an NTSB meeting where Flight 549's final transmissions are shown. Mulder theorizes that the plane was forced down by aliens attempting to abduct Max; the NTSB team, led by chief investigator Mike Millar (Joe Spano), dismisses his claims.|$|E
5|$|Hal Jordan, a cocky {{test pilot}} working at Ferris Aircraft, is {{chosen by the}} ring and transported <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> site, where the dying Abin Sur {{appoints}} him a Green Lantern, telling {{him to take the}} lantern and speak the oath. Jordan says the oath and is whisked away to the Green Lantern Corps home planet of Oa, where he meets and trains with veteran Corps members Tomar-Re, Kilowog, and Corps leader Sinestro, who believes he is unfit and fearful. Jordan quits and returns to Earth, keeping the power ring and lantern.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, {{he participated}} in Operation Mount Hope III, during which U.S. forces {{recovered}} a crashed Soviet-made Mi-24 Hind attack helicopter in Chad. Company E of the 160th deployed to N'Djamena, Chad via C-5 Galaxy. Once in Chad the company flew two CH-47 Chinooks 490 nautical miles at night, {{without the use of}} navigational aids, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> site. Once at the crash site the crews harnessed the crashed Hind to a Chinook via sling-load. During the returning flight both Chinooks performed an air-to-air refuel with a C-130; and later endured a sandstorm before returning with the Hind.|$|E
5|$|Nibali {{attacked}} {{again just}} after the summit and rode alone down the descent. Despite almost colliding with a race motorbike at one point, he used his strong descending skills to gain an advantage {{over the rest of}} the group. He used the whole width of the road and coming very close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> barriers at various moments. Rosa, meanwhile, came {{to the head of the}} group in an attempt to slow the chase down. Nibali's lead at the foot of the descent was around 40 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The Flight Superintendent and the Technical Superintendent of ANA {{simulated}} some {{of these}} events during a test flight in another DC-4. They were satisfied that the time intervals between events were compatible with the likely sequence of events leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> of the Amana, {{and that it was}} a plausible explanation of the accident. However, on legal advice this possible explanation of the crash was not made public. Two accidents involving Douglas DC-4s, one approaching Dublin Airport, Ireland, in 1961 and another approaching Stockport Airport, Manchester, United Kingdom, in 1967 were attributed to interruption of fuel supply when engines were supplied from the cross-feed system which was open to an empty fuel tank, allowing air to be drawn into the cross-feed pipe.|$|E
