5|$|Among {{domestic}} cats, {{males are}} more likely to fight than females. Among feral cats, the most common reason for cat fighting is competition between two males to mate with a female. In such cases, most fights are won by the heavier male. Another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home. Female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens. Neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> is linked to sex hormones.|$|E

25|$|Another way {{ergodicity}} can {{be broken}} is by the existence of nonlinear soliton symmetries. In 1953, Fermi, Pasta, Ulam and Tsingou conducted computer simulations of a vibrating string that included a non-linear term (quadratic in one test, cubic in another, and a piecewise linear approximation to a cubic in a third). They found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> of the system was quite different from what intuition based on equipartition would have led them to expect. Instead of the energies in the modes becoming equally shared, the system exhibited a very complicated quasi-periodic behavior. This puzzling result was eventually explained by Kruskal and Zabusky in 1965 in a paper which, by connecting the simulated system to the Korteweg–de Vries equation {{led to the development}} of soliton mathematics.|$|E
25|$|When a {{crayfish}} {{is held by}} its carapace {{either in}} the water or in the air, it does not respond with a tail flip when it receives sensory stimuli that would normally elicit the response. This inhibitory behavior {{does not seem to}} be mediated by the abdomen. When the thorax-abdomen junction is severed, the inhibitory effect is lost and the LGI in severed abdomen generates strong spikes since its threshold had decreased substantially. This is an indication <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> is mediated in the brain or the thorax of the crayfish. Most non-giant and MGI tail flips are also suppressed by restraint, so only a few non-giant systems are active to allow the crayfish to carefully wriggle free. The setup of this system seems to be designed to prevent the unnecessary use of all or nothing tail flips or ineffective tail flips when the situation requires more careful maneuvering.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether visible markers of brain injury shape people's causal attributions for <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> of <b>the</b> {{person with the}} injury and their expectations that those behaviors will persist for 5 years. Design: Experimental scenarios described an adolescent boy with a brain injury (pictured either {{with or without a}} head scar) who showed 4 behavior changes relating to sleep, anger, self-confidence, and motivation. Setting: Victoria University of Wellington. Participants: University student volunteers (N = 249). Measures: For each behavior, ratings of attributions to either the brain injury or to adolescence and estimates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> would persist for 5 years. Results: Attributions to brain injury correlated with expectations <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> would persist. Participants attributed <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> more to <b>the</b> brain injury than to adolescence in the scar condition but not in the no-scar condition. Conclusions: Visible markers of brain injury such as scars are spurious markers of severity that shape attributions for actions of persons with the injury and expectations that problematic <b>behaviors</b> will persist. <b>The</b> results inform strategies for correcting misunderstandings about brain injury and enhancing rehabilitation...|$|R

25|$|A {{distributed}} denial-of-service (DDoS) attack {{occurs when}} multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually {{one or more}} web servers. Such an attack is often the result of multiple compromised systems (for example, a botnet) flooding the targeted system with traffic. A botnet is a network of zombie computers programmed to receive commands without the owners' knowledge. When a server is overloaded with connections, new connections {{can no longer be}} accepted. The major advantages to an attacker of using a distributed denial-of-service attack are that multiple machines can generate more attack traffic than one machine, multiple attack machines are harder to turn off than one attack machine, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> of each attack machine can be stealthier, making it harder to track and shut down. These attacker advantages cause challenges for defense mechanisms.

This, after all, will end up completely crashing a website for periods of time.|$|E
25|$|Democritus—the {{original}} atomist—argued {{that all}} {{things in the}} universe, including light, are composed of indivisible sub-components (light being some form of solar atom). At {{the beginning of the}} 11th Century, the Arabic scientist Alhazen wrote the first comprehensive treatise on optics; describing refraction, reflection, and the operation of a pinhole lens via rays of light traveling from the point of emission to the eye. He asserted that these rays were composed of particles of light. In 1630, René Descartes popularized and accredited the opposing wave description in his treatise on light, showing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> of light could be re-created by modeling wave-like disturbances in a universal medium ("plenum"). Beginning in 1670 and progressing over three decades, Isaac Newton developed and championed his corpuscular hypothesis, arguing that the perfectly straight lines of reflection demonstrated light's particle nature; only particles could travel in such straight lines. He explained refraction by positing that particles of light accelerated laterally upon entering a denser medium. Around the same time, Newton's contemporaries Robert Hooke and Christiaan Huygens—and later Augustin-Jean Fresnel—mathematically refined the wave viewpoint, showing that if light traveled at different speeds in different media (such as water and air), refraction could be easily explained as the medium-dependent propagation of light waves. The resulting Huygens–Fresnel principle was extremely successful at reproducing light's behavior and was subsequently supported by Thomas Young's 1803 discovery of double-slit interference. The wave view did not immediately displace the ray and particle view, but began to dominate scientific thinking about light in the mid 19th century, since it could explain polarization phenomena that the alternatives could not.|$|E

500|$|On October 13, Luce's telegraphed {{report from}} Quebec was {{received}} at the Collins New York office. The {{news of his}} survival {{was the cause of}} celebration and thanksgiving. In its first paragraph Luce informed Edward Collins that the lost passengers likely [...] "included your wife, daughter and son, with whom I took a last leave the moment the ship was going down". That day, the Baltimore Sun reported the loss of the entire Brown party. [...] Luce's account of the rushing of lifeboats, and the early departures of officers and crew, caused considerable consternation in New York, which quickly turned to anger and condemnation as it became apparent that no women or children had been saved, and that most of the survivors were from the crew. The New York Times reported [...] "an entire lack of disciplined control over the whole of the ship", and that [...] "the officers and crew did not do their best towards saving the vessel, which they left too early". Paul Grann, from Dorian's boat, reported that [...] "all order and discipline ceased on board", and that Rogers had threatened passengers with firearms. [...] Later press accounts condemned the crew in increasingly harsh terms; The New York Times referred to [...] "a ghastly desertion of duty", and condemned the [...] "cowardly and dastardly conduct of the crew". [...] Scientific American adjudged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> of the crew in saving themselves before their passengers had [...] "blackened the character of our marine {{in the eyes of the}} whole world". Captain Luce, however, was largely exculpated; he had not sought to save himself, had gone down with his ship, and had survived largely by chance.

500|$|Changeling {{begins with}} an abduction, but largely avoids framing the story as a family drama to {{concentrate}} on {{a portrait of a}} woman whose desire for independence is seen as a threat to male-dominated society. The film depicts 1920s Los Angeles as a city in which the judgment of men takes precedence; women are labeled [...] "hysterical and unreliable" [...] if they dare to question it. Film critic Prairie Miller said that in its portrayal of female courage the film was [...] "about as feminist as Hollywood can get", and that because of this it had been the subject of sexist disdain. She compared this with the sexism shown to the women in Changeling and those who vied for high political office in 2008. Miller surmised that attitudes to independent, career-minded women had not changed significantly in the intervening years: Collins defies male-generated cultural expectations that women are not suited for professional careers and are punished for it. Rather than [...] "an expression of feminist awareness", David Denby argues, the film—like Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby—is [...] "a case of awed respect for a woman who was strong and enduring". The portrait of a vulnerable woman whose mental state is manipulated by the authorities was likened to the treatment of Ingrid Bergman's character in Gaslight(1944), who also wondered if she might be insane; Eastwood cited photographs that show Collins smiling with the child she knows is not hers. Like many other women of the period who were deemed disruptive, Collins is forced into the secret custody of a mental institution. The film shows that psychiatry became a tool in the gender politics of the era, only a few years after women's suffrage in the United States was guaranteed by the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment. As women ceased to be second-class citizens and began to assert their independence, the male establishment used mental institutions in an effort to disempower them; in common with other unmanageable women, Collins is subjected to medical treatment designed to break her spirit and compel obedience, though some of the treatments, specifically the electroconvulsive therapy depicted in the film, did not exist ca. 1928-1930. The film quotes the testimony of the psychiatrist who treated Collins. Eastwood said the testimony evidenced how women were prejudged, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> of the police reflected how women were seen at the time. He quoted the words of the officer who sent Collins to the mental facility: Something is wrong with you. You're an independent woman. Clint Eastwood said, [...] "The period could not accept [...] ".|$|E
