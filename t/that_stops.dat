It is susceptible to moisture, so must be laid on a course <b>that</b> <b>stops</b> rising dampness, must be roofed or covered to keep out water from above, and may need protection through some sort of plaster, paint or sheathing.|$|E
5|$|Salicylic acid is a topically applied beta-hydroxy acid <b>that</b> <b>stops</b> {{bacteria}} from reproducing and has keratolytic properties. It opens obstructed skin pores {{and promotes}} shedding of epithelial skin cells. Salicylic acid {{is known to}} be less effective than retinoid therapy. Dry skin is the most commonly seen side effect with topical application, though darkening of the skin has been observed in individuals with darker skin types.|$|E

5|$|Treatment of HHT is {{symptomatic}} (it {{deals with}} the symptoms rather than the disease itself), {{as there is no}} therapy <b>that</b> <b>stops</b> the development of telangiectasias and AVMs directly. Furthermore, some treatments are applied to prevent the development of common complications. Chronic nosebleeds and digestive tract bleeding can both lead to anemia; if the bleeding itself cannot be completely stopped, the anemia requires treatment with iron supplements. Those who cannot tolerate iron tablets or solutions may require administration of intravenous iron, and blood transfusion if the anemia is causing severe symptoms that warrant rapid improvement of the blood count.|$|E

25|$|A {{remedial}} {{response is}} a long-term action <b>that</b> <b>stops</b> or substantially reduces a release of a hazardous substance that could affect public health or the environment. The term remediation, or cleanup, is sometimes used interchangeably with the terms remedial action, removal action, response action, remedy, or corrective action.|$|E
25|$|The pilot's {{movement}} of a control causes the mechanical circuit {{to open the}} matching servo valve in the hydraulic circuit. The hydraulic circuit powers the actuators which then move the control surfaces.

Some exhibit weight loss, and closer investigation often reveals evidence of fakery.|$|E

25|$|Santiago’s {{location}} {{within a}} watershed {{is one of}} the most important factors determining the climate of the city. The coastal mountain range serves as a screen <b>that</b> <b>stops</b> the spread of maritime influence, contributing to the increase in annual and daily thermal oscillation (the difference between the maximum and minimum daily temperatures can reach 14°C) and maintaining low relative humidity, close to an annual average of 70%. It also prevents the entry of air masses, with the exception of some coastal low clouds that penetrate to the basin through the river valleys.|$|E

25|$|Being {{the most}} curious of the Three, Jayfeather {{tries to find}} out who his true parents are. When asking around about his birth, Mousefur reveals that Leafpool accidentally put a strange herb in Mousefur's tansy soon after Jayfeather's birth. After looking through herbs in the {{medicine}} cat's den and with herbs sticking to his pelt, he goes to Mousefur to deliver some fresh-kill. Mousefur says that a certain herb sticking to his fur is the mystery herb, but Jayfeather does not know what it is. To find out, he asks Littlecloud when the medicine cats meet at the Moonpool. The ShadowClan medicine cat recognizes it as parsley, a herb <b>that</b> <b>stops</b> the milk of a cat whose kits die. Jayfeather remembers that while going back to the camp after birth, there is another cat with him besides Squirrelflight: Leafpool, Jayfeather's true mother.|$|E
25|$|The Moorgate tube crash {{occurred}} on 28 February 1975 on the isolated Northern City Line when a southbound train failed {{to stop at}} the Moorgate terminus and crashed into the wall at end of the tunnel, killing forty-four people. No fault was found with the train equipment, the subsequent report found that there was insufficient evidence to determine the cause. Following the incident, a system <b>that</b> <b>stops</b> a train automatically if the driver fails to brake was introduced at dead-ends on the London Underground. The Northern City Line was connected to British Rail tracks at Finsbury Park in the 1970s. The last tube train ran in October 1975, and British Rail services began in 1976. In 1977, the Piccadilly line was extended from Hounslow to Heathrow Airport, and in 1986 a platform serving Terminal 4 opened on a loop line.|$|E
25|$|Through the centuries, {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} for processing tea, and a number of different forms of tea, were developed. During the Tang dynasty, tea was steamed, then pounded and shaped into cake form, while in the Song dynasty, loose-leaf tea was developed and became popular. During the Yuan and Ming dynasties, unoxidized tea leaves were first pan-fried, then rolled and dried, a process <b>that</b> <b>stops</b> the oxidation process that turns the leaves dark, thereby allowing tea to remain green. In the 15th century, oolong tea, in which the leaves were allowed to partially oxidize before pan-frying, was developed. Western tastes, however, favoured the fully oxidized black tea, and the leaves were allowed to oxidize further. Yellow tea was an accidental discovery in the production of green tea during the Ming dynasty, when apparently sloppy practices allowed the leaves to turn yellow, but yielded a different flavour as a result.|$|E
