5|$|It was not {{possible}} to simply drive through the gap in the fence that existed at crossing points, as the East Germans installed high-impact vehicle barriers and mobile rolling barriers that could (and did) kill drivers that attempted to ram them. Vehicles were subjected to rigorous checks to uncover fugitives. Inspection pits and mirrors allowed the undersides of vehicles to be scrutinised. Probes were used to investigate the chassis and even the fuel tank, where a fugitive might be concealed, and vehicles could be partially dismantled in on-site garages. At Marienborn there was even a mortuary garage where coffins could be checked to confirm that the occupants really were dead. Passengers were checked and often interrogated about their <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> and reasons for travelling. The system used simple technology and was slow, relying largely on vast card indexes recording travellers' details, but it was effective nonetheless; during the 28years of operation of the Marienborn complex, no successful escapes were recorded.|$|E

In Connecticut, utility companies readied supplies and emergency crews {{in advance of the}} hurricane. In Massachusetts and Rhode Island, with the anticipation of heavy rains, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) prepared to send eight teams into the field to take measurements along 30 rivers. Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Almond advised residents to prepare for the storm's onslaught.

40|$|Purpose The <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> {{designed}} for the O 2 is described in this case study as the teaching materials to help student understand {{how to make a}} <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> for a newly developed leisure venue and the factors to be considered in making the plan. It illustrates how to design multimode transportation and mode split for passenger travel. It also allows students to consider environmental protection issues when developing a green <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> for a new area. Design/methodology/approach This case is mainly secondary research and compiled from published resources about The O 2, survey outcomes and monitoring reports provided by Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) (2006, 2007), as well as other relevant literature. Findings The <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> is developed with comprehensive targets and a monitoring programme to encourage environmentally sustainable travel choices by visitors to the O 2, and devised a coordinated approach {{for the benefit of the}} environment around the O 2. Key strategies proposed in the <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> include the appointment of a full time transport coordinator to work with partnership organisations, including the London Borough of Greenwich (LBG), Transport for London (TfL) and other transport operators, improvements to bus and underground services and a new river service from central London.

The value of describing the <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> in the case brings the readers a coordinated approach for the benefit of the environment around the O 2.

40|$|The Internet {{has grown}} {{to be one of}} the most {{effective}} means for trip planning and recent research shows that that the nature and extent of <b>travel</b> <b>planning</b> behavior has evolved over time. This study builds upon this literature by examining the impact of the Internet on fifteen different facets of <b>travel</b> <b>planning</b> using data sets describing online American travel in 2007 and 2009. The results indicate that the use of the Internet has resulted in an increase in the number of places considered visiting, the number of destinations actually visited, the amount of time spent on advance planning, and the number of information sources used for planning while the likelihood of calling to make a reservation or to request travel information decreased. However, the extent of impact appears to have declined significantly from 2007 to 2009. Further, the findings of this study indicate that the impact of the Internet on <b>travel</b> <b>planning</b> behavior are directly associated with the perceived benefits of Internet use. Based upon these findings, it appears that the extent to which traditional Internet-based information channels affect <b>travel</b> <b>planning</b> behavior has stabilized and that emerging Internet based technologies such as Web 2. 0 and mobile computing are looming as major forces reshaping traveler planning behavior. This paper argues that future research should focus on better understanding the ways these new systems affect <b>travel</b> <b>planning</b> behavior...|$|R
