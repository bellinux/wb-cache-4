5|$|The island's lush vegetation, {{a product}} of its mild climate and {{frequent}} rainfall, earns it the sobriquet the Emerald Isle. Overall, Ireland has a mild but changeable oceanic climate with few extremes. <b>The</b> <b>climate</b> <b>is</b> typically insular and is temperate avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas {{in the world at}} similar latitudes.

5|$|An oceanic (or maritime) {{climate is}} {{typically}} found {{along the west}} coasts at the middle latitudes of all the world's continents, bordering cool oceans, as well as southeastern Australia, and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation year-round. The Mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of western North America, parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa and in parts of central Chile. <b>The</b> <b>climate</b> <b>is</b> characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. A steppe is a dry grassland. Subarctic climates are cold with continuous permafrost and little precipitation.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{through the}} Cretaceous period {{and into the}} early Tertiary, there was {{uplifting}} {{in the area of}} the Colorado Plateau, the San Juan Mountains, and the La Plata Mountains, which led to the formation of the Mesa Verde pediment with the help of erosion. Small channels of water ran across this formation depositing gravel. Later in the tertiary, the last period of uplift and rock tilting towards the south caused these streams to cut rapidly into the rock removing loose sediment and forming the vast canyons seen today. This caused the isolation of the Mesa Verde pediment from surrounding rock. Today, since <b>the</b> <b>climate</b> <b>is</b> more arid, these erosional processes are slowed.|$|E
5|$|Despite its urban character, the San Francisco Bay {{is one of}} California's most ecologically {{important}} habitats, providing key {{ecosystem services}} such as filtering pollutants and sediments from the rivers, and supporting a number of endangered species. The region is also known for the complexity of its landforms, the result {{of millions of years}} of tectonic plate movements. Because the Bay Area is crossed by six major earthquake faults, the region is particularly exposed to hazards presented by large earthquakes. <b>The</b> <b>climate</b> <b>is</b> temperate and generally very mild, and is ideal for outdoor recreational and athletic activities such as hiking. The Bay Area is host to seven professional sports teams and is a cultural center for music, theater, and the arts. It is also host to several institutions of higher education, ranging from primary schools to major research universities. Home to 101 municipalities and nine counties, governance in the Bay Area is mutlifaceted and involves numerous local and regional actors, each with wide-ranging and overlapping responsibilities.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the Mainland, most of the islands are in two groups, the North and South Isles, {{all of which have}} an underlying geological base of Old Red Sandstone. <b>The</b> <b>climate</b> <b>is</b> mild and the soils are extremely fertile, most of the land being farmed. Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy. The significant wind and marine energy resources are of growing importance, and the island generates more than its total yearly electricity demand using renewables. The local people are known as Orcadians and have a distinctive dialect of Scots and a rich inheritance of folklore. There is an abundance of marine and avian wildlife.|$|E
5|$|Snow {{refers to}} forms of ice {{crystals}} that precipitate {{from the atmosphere}} (usually from clouds) and undergo changes on the Earth's surface. It pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when, under suitable conditions, the ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase to millimeter size, precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take {{on a variety of}} shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where <b>the</b> <b>climate</b> <b>is</b> cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts seasonally, causing runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern European Plain {{encompasses}} Belarus {{and most}} of European Russia. The plain is mostly mountain-free and comprises several plateaus. Russia's northernmost regions are tundra.
