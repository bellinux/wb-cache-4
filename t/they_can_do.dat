Players can also play a card game called Caravan, which was specifically designed for the game and has its own rules, and can be played with certain people outside of the casinos.|$|E
5|$|In {{countries}} where {{women have to}} do paid work in order to feed their family, {{there is a lack}} of regulation and safety standards regarding female workers due to the large amount of informal work available. In Thailand for example, due to the severe economic crisis in 1997, many women have jobs in the informal industry, and often do home-based work so that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> their domestic jobs concurrently with their paid jobs. This increases the work intensity by women doing more than one job at a time, and has been shown to have deteriorating effects on women's health.|$|E
5|$|The adult Iago sparrow feeds {{mainly on}} the seeds of grass and grain (the main cereal crop grown in Cape Verde is maize), but also on insects and plant shoots. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> damage to crops by eating young leaves, and like house sparrows will eat the food scraps {{available}} near houses. Nestlings, by contrast to adults, are fed almost exclusively on insects, especially caterpillars, flies, and orthopterans. The Iago sparrow forages mostly on the ground, moving restlessly whilst clinging to the ground like a mouse.|$|E

5|$|Many {{of these}} species have adaptations to help in under-water locomotion. Water beetles and water bugs have legs adapted into paddle-like structures. Dragonfly naiads use jet propulsion, {{forcibly}} expelling water out of their rectal chamber. Some species like the water striders are capable of walking {{on the surface of}} water. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> this because their claws are not at the tips of the legs as in most insects, but recessed in a special groove further up the leg; this prevents the claws from piercing the water's surface film. Other insects such as the Rove beetle Stenus are known to emit pygidial gland secretions that reduce surface tension making it possible for them to move on the surface of water by Marangoni propulsion (also known by the German term Entspannungsschwimmen).|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} three volumes concern {{themselves with the}} battle for a third ring, which has been embedded for years {{in the body of}} a comatose young man named Emilio Lufas Getto. Gamma and company learn of Emilio's existence from his sister Wolfina, a tabloid photojournalist and vigilante who does not believe in the Rings of the Dead. The group of hunters offer to restore Emilio to consciousness in exchange for the ring he contains. Before <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> so, however, Emilio is kidnapped by Balmunk the Mystic, a powder hunting magician who leads a circus-themed gang. Wolfina teams up with Elwood, Gamma, and Smith to retrieve Emilio, and they succeed in doing so after a number of battles with Balmunk's henchmen. The conflict culminates in a fight between Gamma and a giant golem summoned by Balmunk, which Gamma defeats {{with the help of a}} berserk state. Balmunk is beaten but not killed, and departs, swearing revenge upon Gamma.|$|E
5|$|All {{weapons and}} apparel {{found within the}} Wastelands, {{regardless}} of whether they are a makeshift-weapon such as a lead pipe, or a gun, degrade over time the more they are used, and thus become less effective. For firearms, degrading into poor condition causes them to do less damage and possibly jam when reloading, while apparel that reduces damage becomes less protective as it gradually absorbs damage from attacks. When too much damage is taken, the items breaks and cannot be used. To ensure weapons and apparel are working effectively, such items require constant maintenance and repairs which can be done in one of two ways. The first method is find certain vendors that repair items, though how much they can repair an item depends on their skill level, while the cost of the repairs depends upon the item itself. The second method is for players to find a second of the same item that needs repairs (or a comparable item), and salvaging parts from it for the repair, though how much <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> depends on their character's own skill level in repairs.|$|E

5|$|Although {{skeptical of}} New World Order conspiracism, {{political}} scientist David Rothkopf argues, in the 2008 book , {{that the world}} population of 6 billion people is governed by an elite of 6,000 individuals. Until the late 20th century, governments of the great powers provided most of the superclass, accompanied by a few heads of international movements (i.e., the Pope of the Catholic Church) and entrepreneurs (Rothschilds, Rockefellers). According to Rothkopf, in the early 21st century, economic clout—fueled by the explosive expansion of international trade, travel and communication—rules; the nation-state's power has diminished shrinking politicians to minority power broker status; leaders in international business, finance and the defense industry not only dominate the superclass, they move freely into high positions in their nations' governments and back to private life largely beyond the notice of elected legislatures (including the U.S. Congress), which remain abysmally ignorant of affairs beyond their borders. He asserts that the superclass' disproportionate influence over national policy is constructive but always self-interested, and that across the world, few object to corruption and oppressive governments provided <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> business in these countries.|$|E
5|$|Riker {{gets up to}} {{date with}} the situation, and decides that while Ramsey and his group are at large and refusing to leave the planet, there is little <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> Before leaving they find that one of Beata's assistants, Ariel (Patricia McPherson), has married Ramsey, and was {{followed}} by Beata's guards to their camp, where they arrested the survivors and their families. The Away Team attempt to explain to Beata the reason for Ramsey's refusal to leave. Beata and her council reject his reasoning, and threatens to execute them the following day. After failing to convince Ramsey and his group to leave with them, Riker contacts the Enterprise, in hopes to transport Ramsey and his group without their consent (despite it being {{a violation of the}} Prime Directive, and almost certainly an end to his career), but Dr. Crusher (while treating an incapacitated Geordi in the Captain's chair) refuses to allow anyone to beam aboard for fear of being infected, but allows Data, as an android, to return. Riker orders Data to take command and get the Enterprise to the Neutral Zone before it's too late.|$|E

25|$|Thirdly, covetousness is {{the third}} worldly evil, which {{is also known as}} lust. Colet calls this a plague that has {{overtaken}} many priests and blinded many.
