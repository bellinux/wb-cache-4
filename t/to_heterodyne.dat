5000|$|In such a radio receiver, a local {{oscillator}} (LO) is used <b>to</b> <b>heterodyne</b> or [...] "beat" [...] against the incoming radio frequency (RF), generating sum and difference frequencies. One {{of these will}} be at the intermediate frequency (IF), and will be selected and amplified. The radio receiver is responsive to any signal at its designed IF frequency, including unwanted signals. For example, with a LO tuned to 110 MHz, there are two incoming signal frequencies that can generate a 10 MHz IF frequency. A signal broadcast at 100 MHz (the wanted signal), and mixed with the 110 MHz LO will create the sum frequency of 210 MHz (ignored by the receiver), and the difference frequency at the desired 10 MHz. However, a signal broadcast at 120 MHz (the unwanted signal), and mixed with the 110 MHz LO will create a sum frequency of 230 MHz (ignored by the receiver), and the difference frequency also at 10 MHz. The signal at 120 MHz is called the image of the wanted signal at 100 MHz. The ability of the receiver to reject this image gives the image rejection ratio (IMRR) of the system.|$|E

40|$|Heterodyne laser phase {{measurements}} in a space-based {{gravitational wave}} interferometer are degraded by the phase fluctuations of the onboard clocks, resulting in unacceptable sensitivity performance {{levels of the}} interferometric data. In order to calibrate out the clock phase noises it has been previously suggested that additional inter-spacecraft phase measurements must be performed by modulating the laser beams. This technique, however, considerably increases system complexity and probability of subsystem failure. With the advent of self-referenced optical frequency combs, it is possible <b>to</b> generate the <b>heterodyne</b> microwave signal that is coherently referenced to the onboard laser.

40|$|The use {{of optical}} fibers {{presents}} several advantages {{with respect to}} free-space optical transport regarding sourcefrequency delivery <b>to</b> individual <b>heterodyne</b> interferometers. Unfortunately, fiber delivery <b>to</b> individual coaxial <b>heterodyne</b> interferometers leads <b>to</b> an increase of (periodic) nonlinearity in the measurement, because transporting coaxial frequencies through one optical fiber leads to frequency mixing. Coaxial beams thus require delivery via free-space transportation methods. In contrast, the heterodyne interferometer concept discussed in this Letter is based on separated source frequencies, which allow for fiber delivery without additional nonlinearity. This investigation analyzes the influence of external disturbances acting on the two fibers during delivery, causing asymmetry in phase between the two fibers (first-order effect), and irradiance fluctuations (second-order effect). Experiments using electro-optic phase modulation and acousto-optic irradiance modulation confirmed that the interferometerconcept can measure with sub-nanometer uncertainty using fiber delivered source frequencies, enabling fully fiber-coupled heterodyne displacement interferometers.

40|$|Do {{stochastic}} Schrödinger equations, {{also known}} as unravelings, have a physical interpretation? In the Markovian limit, where the system on average obeys a master equation, the answer is yes. Markovian stochastic Schrödinger equations generate quantum trajectories for the system state conditioned on continuously monitoring the bath. For a given master equation, {{there are many different}} unravelings, corresponding to different sorts of measurement on the bath. In this paper we address the non-Markovian case, and in particular the sort of stochastic equation introduced by Strunz, Diósi, and Gisin [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 1801 (1999) ]. Using a quantum measurement theory approach, we rederive their unraveling which involves complex-valued Gaussian noise. We also derive an unraveling involving real-valued Gaussian noise. We show that in the Markovian limit, these two unravelings correspond <b>to</b> <b>heterodyne</b> and homodyne detection respectively. Although we use quantum measurement theory to define these unravelings, we conclude that the stochastic evolution of the system state is not a true quantum trajectory, as the identity of the state through time is a fiction.

In some critical cases, as Bell's tests and cryptography, the random numbers are required to be both secure (i. e. known only by the legitimate user) and to be provided at an ultra-fast rate (i. e. larger than Gbit/s). However, practical generators are usually considered trusted, but their security can be compromised in case of imperfections or malicious external actions. In this work we introduce an efficient protocol which guarantees security and speed in the generation. We propose a novel source-device-independent protocol based on generic Positive Operator Valued Measurements and then we specialize the result <b>to</b> <b>heterodyne</b> measurements. The security of the generated numbers is proven without any assumption on the source, which can be even fully controlled by an adversary.

To understand NEMS manufactured from Graphene we introduce a technique called electrostatic heterodyne force microscopy (E-HFM).

40|$|The {{generation}} of a split-frequency is inherent <b>to</b> <b>heterodyne</b> displacement interferometry. Currently this split-frequency is predominantly generated by either acousto-optic modulators (AOM), Zeeman-lasers (ZL), or a combination. Both techniques have their drawbacks, e. g.

Whereas the optical output power of a Zeeman-laser decreases rapidly as the split frequency is increased. This publication presents a third method to generate split-frequencies for heterodyne displacement interferometry, making use of an electro-optic rotating quarter wave-plate. Using this technique, the split-frequency is tunable, optical power is preserved, and the technique has potential to generate split-frequencies of several MHz.
