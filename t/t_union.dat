40|$|The Antebellum Puzzle' {{describes}} {{the situation of}} declining stature and pos mortality in the three decades prior to the American Civil War (1861 - 65). It is this period was one of rapid economic growth and development in the United State the debate has centered on whether the American diet, {{both in terms of}} protein a deteriorated {{in the middle of the}} 19 th century. But the mortality environment a have worsened (or at least did not improve), connected with factors such as urba commercialization, and increased geographic mobility. This paper uses data on <b>t</b> <b>Union</b> Army recruits as an indicator of the standard of living of Americans durin Particular attention is paid to New York State and comparisons to the rest of th York State, mortality was not improving in the antebellum period and was deterio York City. For the United States and for New York State, urbanization was negat heights, as was the census death rate in 1850 and a measure of mobility (proport population foreign born). Although, New York State's agriculture was rapidly co in this era and specializing in dairy products, its nutrition may have been dete with substantial local variation. Mortality was also not improving and worsened Both contributed to a decline in this biological indicator of the standard of li both New York and the whole United States were experiencing Smithian' economic g (induced by transport improvements and widening markets) with negative externali York State was an area in advance of much of the nation in terms of both urban/i agricultural development in the antebellum period. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{ethical behavior}} in {{organizations and the}} decisions made {{when faced with a}} crisis. The research looks at the anatomy of a crisis and the stages of a crisis (Gottschalk, 1993). The image restoration strategies are also included, along with the justification for image restoration in organizations. The five image restoration strategies are denial, evading responsibility, reducing the offensiveness, corrective action, and mortification (Benoit, 1995). Ethical apologia theory is described in the paper as well as the four factors of verbal defense (Ware and Linkugel, 1973). These four factors are denial, differentiation, bolstering, and transcendence. The paper also studies eight cases of image restoration and the actions taken by companies faced with a crisis. The companies researched are Ford, Johnson 2 ̆ 6 Johnson, Exxon, McDonald 2 ̆ 7 s, AT 2 ̆ 6 <b>T,</b> <b>Union</b> Carbide, Gerber, and Kinder Morgan. Each case is studied in depth and the image restoration strategy used by each is examined and judged for its success in correcting the problem. The research conducted provides a key insight into the successfulness of image restoration strategies. It also presents the actions that take place when a company is involved in a crisis. The research methodology used for this paper involves an examination of eight cases of crisis and analyses of the impact of each crisis on the company. Overall, this paper supplies information regarding what occurs during a crisis, a correct way to respond to a crisis, and real-life examples of the right and wrong responses by well-known organizations...|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} {{is based on}} the full exploitation of the separation power of a 0. 05 mm internal diameter (ID) capillary, as a comprehensive two-dimensional (2 D) GC (GC×GC) secondary column, with the objective of attaining very high-resolution second dimension separations. The aim was achieved by using a split-flow system developed in previous research [P. Q. Tranchida, A. Casilli, P. Dugo, G. Dugo, L. Mondello, Anal. Chem. 79 (2007) 2266], and a dual-oven GC×GC instrument. The column combination employed consisted of a polar 30 m× 0. 25 mm ID column connected, by means of a <b>T</b> <b>union,</b> to a detector-linked high-resolution 1. 1 m× 0. 05 mm ID apolar analytical column and to a 0. 33 m× 0. 05 mm ID retention gap; the latterwas connected to a manually operated split valve. As previously demonstrated, the use of a split valve enables the regulation of gas flows through both analytical columns, generating the most appropriate gas linear velocities. Comprehensive 2 D GC experiments were carried out on Arabica roasted coffee volatiles (previously extracted by means of solid-phase microextraction) with the splitvalve closed (equal to what can be defined as conventional GC×GC) and with the split-valve opened at various degrees. The reasons why it is absolutely not effective to use a 0. 05 mm ID column as second dimension in a conventional GC×GC instrument will be discussed and demonstrated. On the contrary, the use of a 0. 05 mm ID column as second dimension, under ideal conditions in a split-flow, twin-oven system, will also be illustrated and discussed...|$|E

40|$|Strong {{equivalence}} is {{an important}} property for nonmonotonic formalisms, allowing safe local changes to a nonmonotonic theory. This paper considers strong equivalence for nonmonotonic causal theories of the kind introduced by McCain and Turner. Causal theories T_ 1 and T_ 2 are strongly equivalent if, for every causal theory <b>T,</b> T_ 1 <b>union</b> <b>T</b> and T_ 2 <b>union</b> <b>T</b> are equivalent (that is, have the same causal models). The paper introduces a convenient characterization of this property in terms of so-called SE-models, much as was done previously for answer set programs and default theories. A similar result is provided for the nonmonotonic modal logic UCL. The paper also introduces a reduction from the problem of deciding strong equivalence of two causal theories {{to the problem of}} deciding equivalence of two sets of propositional formulas...|$|R
