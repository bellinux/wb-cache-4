2500|$|The Tasmanian central plateau was uplifted {{from the}} lower Meander Valley, most {{probably}} in the Eocene epoch though possibly earlier, forming the escarpment of the Great Western Tiers. [...] The face of the tiers has been eroded and retreated approximately [...] since then, leaving Quamby Bluff as a solitary outlier. The bluff has similar geology {{to the rest of}} the range, and a similar form with cliffs, and talus (a mixture of scree and soil) slopes. Due to its prominence and isolation, views from the <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> a large <b>portion</b> of Northern Tasmania. In the right conditions Mount Strzelecki on Flinders Island, approximately [...] distant, can be seen from the peak. It's largely flat peak is [...] above sea level. The mountain's sandstone and mudstone base is of Triassic original and lies in near horizontal strata. Dolerite rocks formed during the Jurassic period intrude through this base. Erosion has formed the dolerite into steep cliffs and scree slopes which dominate the top of the mountain. The bluff has outcrops of Proterozoic era rocks that are the amongst the oldest found in Tasmania. These rocks are regarded as metamorphosed sediments containing a laminate of graphite, mica quartz-sericite and sericite schists.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Gearbox <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> {{is a vital}} {{component}} of horizontally split integrally geared centrifugal compressor. Reliability of <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> {{is directly related to}} the structural rigidity and structural integrity of compressor. Assuming that the <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> is designed within the mechanical limits of its construction material, one of the most common causes of <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> failure is resonance. The aim of the designer while designing <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> is to have minimum weight and still have sufficient rigidity to avoid resonance. It is imperative; however, that rigorous engineering analysis is applied in the initial design phase to prevent resonance that will result in failure of gearbox <b>top</b> <b>cover.</b> To meet the objectives of designing a reliable integrally geared centrifugal compressor, gearbox <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> modal analysis is of utmost importance. Numerical modal analysis, usually based on Finite Element Method, is commonly used to determine the vibration characteristics, such as natural frequencies and the associated mode shapes of a structure. This paper addresses finite element analysis and modal testing of gearbox <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> of an integrally geared centrifugal compressor. The goal is to determine, verify and validate the vibration characteristics of the gearbox <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> using both analytical and experimental techniques. The 3 -D solid model of the gearbox <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> was built using Autodesk Inventor®. ANSYS workbench 13 ® was used for preprocessing, solving and post processing. Modal analysis involved extraction of mode shapes and natural frequencies. Impact testing using hammer excitation was used to experimentally determine the vibration properties of the gearbox to...|$|R

40|$|The report compiles {{existing}} {{information about}} materials used for designing a <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> construction pursuant to Landfill Directive 1999 / 31 /EC. The report includes a short review of existing requirements on top liners, {{especially in the}} Nordic countries. Accepting waste materials in <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> requires reliable information of both the technical and environmental properties. Important properties of waste material are listed, and factors {{to be considered in}} evaluating the functionality of the whole <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> construction are discussed. Key points in the evaluation of the suitability of waste materials in <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> are: the waste material fulfils the quality requirements and functions of the whole construction the quality variations of key properties are known and acceptable the long-term behaviour of the waste material is evaluated through pilot studies and proved reliable. This report describes the characteristics of the most typical waste materials used for designing <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> constructions. Moreover, a summary of Nordic studies on potential waste materials for <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> has been collated...|$|R
