40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{estimation}} algorithm for functional system reliability influence on the aircraft <b>technical</b> <b>maintenance.</b> The research results which allow to estimate the functional system reliability influence on the aircraft tech- nical maintenance process are provided. The aircraft maintenance process effectiveness implies the maintenance procedures including pre-flight preparation, the flight itself, <b>technical</b> <b>maintenance</b> and storage. The research was aimed at forecasting the aircraft <b>technical</b> <b>maintenance</b> process considering the functional system reliability, with special attention payed to failure-free operation. The term failure-free operation stands for the ability to execute a required function within a given time interval at given conditions. The objects of maintenance -aircraft functional systems and their components have a great degree of failure-free operation, {{which has been a}} design requirement and is supported at aircraft maintenance and operation. Failures and mal- functions are seldom events. This fact leads to a limited statistic maintenance surveillance database. Classical methods of statistical analyses do not provide the sufficient fiducial probability for functional system failure-free operation estimation. Thus these methods do not allow to estimate its influence on the aircraft <b>technical</b> <b>maintenance</b> process effectiveness. In order to solve this problem it is suggested to use the method of flow diagrams and random sample statistical method for failure-free operation estimation-statistical modeling (Monte-Carlo Method). Reliability flow diagram method allowed to determine the functional system failure-free operation random sample dependence on the <b>technical</b> <b>maintenance</b> frequency. The initial data were: the functional system flow diagram, the list of the main equipment, functional system equipment failure random sample data. The use of statistical modeling allowed to estimate the dependence of functional system reliability (failure-free operation) on the <b>technical</b> <b>maintenance</b> frequency for expanded statistical database (a num- ber of functional system maintenance and operation procedures) ...|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{an attempt at}} determining the impact exerted by principles of financing the cooperative housing sector on <b>technical</b> <b>maintenance</b> of housing resources. Its theoretical part is based on descriptive analysis supported by the theory explaining the impact exerted {{on the process of}} <b>technical</b> <b>maintenance</b> of housing resources by the financial system. The authoresses proceed from an assumption that the financial system in the cooperative housing sector has characteristics of a parametric system, which theoretically creates possibilities for the effective functioning of the process of <b>technical</b> <b>maintenance</b> of housing resources. These possibilities have be engreatly reduced in conditions of the economic crisis. This thesis is supplementd by statistical interpretation of te analyzed economic phenomena.

Moreover, we find that increased transparency led to a larger liquidity effect on the days prior to an FOMC meeting. Liquidity effect Federal funds market Open market operations...|$|R
