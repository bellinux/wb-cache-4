5|$|The Vishnu Purana narrates {{another version}} {{of the origins of}} Badrinath. According to the tradition, Dharam had two sons, Nar and Narayanboth of which are modern names of Himalayan mountains. They chose the place to spread their {{religion}} and each of them wed <b>the</b> <b>spacious</b> valleys in the Himalayas. Searching for an ideal place to set up a hermitage, they came across the other four Badris of the Pancha Badri, namely Bridha Badri, Yog Bhadri, Dhyan Badri and Bhavish Badri. They finally found the hot and cold spring behind the Alaknanda River and named it Badri Vishal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1987, in Chicago's {{municipal}} elections, Vrdolyak, rather than seeking re-election as alderman, was the Solidarity Party's candidate challenging Washington for mayor. Washington won re-election, and Washington allies won twenty-five City Council seats. Burke led opposition in the City Council, but Washington supporter Alderman Timothy C. Evans replaced Burke as Chairman of the Committee on Finance. Ousted from <b>the</b> <b>spacious</b> Finance Committee staff offices, Burke never used the relatively modest office allocated to him in City Hall and instead worked out of his private law office two blocks away. In the days {{following the death of}} Mayor Washington in office, Burke supported the Council's selection of Alderman Eugene Sawyer over Evans to serve as mayor. Sawyer prevailed, but Burke was the alderman who least often voted in support of the legislative agenda of Mayor Sawyer, Chicago's second black mayor. After Richard M. Daley was elected mayor in {{the spring of}} 1989, Daley nominated Burke as Finance chairman, a position he has held ever since.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins when}} a young man is seen walking alone {{in a small town}} to the snowy {{football}} fields in a morning winter. A cut-scene shows Swift inside a house wearing a comfy sweater draped over one shoulder. She is brooding and singing about her lost love while wandering morosely around her apartment. She is also seen sitting in the bathtub, missing her boyfriend who she didn't treat well when they were together. About halfway through, it starts to snow inside <b>the</b> <b>spacious</b> house. A montage of Swift writing a letter is shown alternately with scenes of her boyfriend strolling around the town. It is then revealed that the whole situation is the aftermath of a break-up between Swift and her boyfriend. It is also shown that Swift slips the letter that she has written in his coat pocket before he leaves. The final scene shows her ex-boyfriend sitting in the bleachers, reading her apology letter.|$|E

25|$|Baku has wildly varying architecture, {{ranging from}} the Old City core to modern {{buildings}} and <b>the</b> <b>spacious</b> layout of the Baku port. Many of the city's most impressive buildings were built during the early 20th century, when architectural elements of the European styles were combined in eclectic style. Baku thus has an original and unique appearance, earning it a reputation as the 'Paris of the East'.|$|E
25|$|Königsberg Castle {{was one of}} the city's {{most notable}} structures.

The Aron Kodesh ark was on a pedestal behind a parokhet curtain in an apse. Above the ark, the tables of the Decalog were supported by two stone lions. Behind it were large organs and the choir of 100 members. The bimah was behind the pedestal.|$|E

25|$|A {{distinctive}} feature of Tel Aviv’s town-scape are the pilotis on {{which most of}} the apartment buildings in the residential quarters are raised. This feature was achieved on the part of several avant-garde architects in the early thirties in a fierce struggle against the existing municipal bye-laws. <b>The</b> <b>spacious</b> voids between the pillars created a shaded street-scape, added to the natural ventilation during the hot summer days and connected the pavements with the green areas.|$|E
25|$|DeBoer's {{task for}} his team on the ice was to prepare to play on two {{completely}} opposite home ice surfaces. The tiny Oak Park Arena favored a hard checking team while <b>the</b> <b>spacious</b> Palace (25 miles away) was an NHL size ice surface. In spite {{of the difference between}} Oak Park and the Palace, the Whalers had the OHL's best home-ice record in 1995–96 (25-6-2), and won their second consecutive Western Division title and the Bumbacco Trophy.|$|E

25|$|Generally a power pitcher, Bell {{averaged}} {{nearly a}} full strikeout per inning but also {{proved to be}} hittable in his 2005 sophomore season allowing 10.8 hits per nine innings and a very high 5.59 earned run average. Bell has a 94–98mph fastball, usually sitting between 95 and 96. He also has an 11–5 curveball in the low 80s. Keith Law of ESPN wrote in 2011 that Bell had a straight fastball and pitches in {{the upper half of}} the zone, and benefited from pitching in <b>the</b> <b>spacious</b> Petco Park as a Padre.|$|E
25|$|The couple {{moved to}} the Ridgedale and {{constructed}} the single pen log cabin around 1832 where they lived until <b>the</b> <b>spacious</b> Greek Revival main house was completed. As their family and resources grew, they added to the farm and constructed the main house in 1835. They had 11 children: Edward, John W., Rebecca, Esther (also known as Etta and Ettie), John, Betty, George, Robert, and Sallie. Son John W. and daughter Sallie died when {{less than two years}} old, and the second John died during the American Civil War in which his brother Edward also fought.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>spacious</b> lots were {{considered}} highly desirable {{because they were}} close to Drake Park, which runs along {{the east side of}} the Deschutes River. In addition, many home sites had choice views of the Cascade Mountain peaks. The area was only a block away from Bend's downtown business district so the city hall, public library, and local Catholic, Methodist, and Episcopalian churches were within easy walking distance. The district was also within walking distance of the Brooks-Scanlon and Shevlin-Hixon lumber mills. As a result, the Drake Park district quickly became the preferred neighborhood for the city's most prominent businessmen.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>spacious</b> margin allowed {{illuminated}} decoration to {{be added}} by hand. The amount of decoration presumably depended on how much each buyer could or would pay. Some copies were never decorated. The place of decoration can be known or inferred for about 30 of the surviving copies. It is possible that 13 of these copies received their decoration in Mainz, but others were worked on {{as far away as}} London. The vellum Bibles were more expensive, and perhaps for this reason tend to be more highly decorated, although the vellum copy in the British Library is completely undecorated.|$|E
25|$|The British built several notable {{structures}} near The Mall, {{including the}} neoclassical Montgomery Hall, which today {{serves as the}} Quaid-e-Azam Library. Lawrence Gardens were also laid near Civil Station, and were paid for by donations solicited from both Lahore's European community, {{as well as from}} wealth locals. The gardens featured over 600 species of plants, and were tended to by a horticulturist sent from London's Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. The British also laid <b>the</b> <b>spacious</b> Lahore Cantonment to the southeast of the Walled City at the former village of Mian Mir, where unlike around The Mall, laws existed against the mixing of different races.|$|E
25|$|Jean-Pierre Rives was {{influential}} in France's bid {{to host the}} 2007 Rugby World Cup, and {{played a part in}} the trophy presentation following the tournament's final. One of his sculptures is now a part of the French rugby calendar, after he was asked in 2007 to design the Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy. The trophy is awarded annually to the winner of the Six Nations match between France and Italy.
