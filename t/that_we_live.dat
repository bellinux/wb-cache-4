25|$|Williams {{released}} a statement on social media branding the comments about her unborn child as racist, noting that it saddened her <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> {{in a society where}} these comments can be made. Năstase then apologised on social media regarding the comments he made about Williams, but made comments about Konta speaking to the umpire which upset him. In a further interview with the BBC, Năstase justified his comments to Konta stating that he only abused her after being ejected from the court and did so as a fan rather than a captain. Năstase additionally added that he regretted his behaviour in the incident. Nastase was not invited to the French Open and Wimbledon following his suspension. The Madrid Open however invited Nastase {{to be part of the}} prize giving ceremony, which ironically was won by Halep (another Romanian player). This was a move that was deemed irresponsible by the WTA who had revoked Nastase's privileges while the ITF carried out its investigation.|$|E

500|$|Steve Lowe {{called the}} song [...] "penetrating surgery on pseudo-meaningful corporations' lifestyles" [...] with [...] "a repugnance for {{prevailing}} yuppified social values".

[...] Sam Steele called the lyrics [...] "a stream of received imagery: scraps of media information, interspersed with lifestyle ad slogans and private prayers for a healthier existence. It is the hum of a world buzzing with words, one of the messages seeming to be <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> in such a synthetic universe we have grown unable to detect reality from artifice." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics have {{compared}} Eliot to Yeats. Yeats believed <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> in a cyclical world, saying, [...] "If it {{be true that}} God is a circle whose centre is everywhere, the saint goes to the centre, the poet and the artist to the ring where everything comes round again." [...] Eliot believed that such a system is stuck within time. Eliot was influenced by Yeats's reading of Dante. This appears in Eliot's Ash-Wednesday by changing Yeats's [...] "desire for absolution" [...] away from a humanistic approach. When Eliot wrote about personal topics, he tended to use Dante as a reference point. He also relied on Dante's imagery: {{the idea of the}} [...] "refining fire" [...] in the Four Quartets and in The Waste Land comes from Purgatorio, and the celestial rose and fire imagery of Paradiso makes its way into the series.|$|E
500|$|... "The Stolen Eagle" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer and co-creator Bruno Heller and directed by Michael Apted, who also directed the following two episodes. Heller said {{the era of the}} Roman Empire was [...] "pivotal in Western history. If things hadn't turned out the way they did at that particular point, the world <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> in now would be very different." [...] He decided {{to tell the story of}} the series from the perspectives of two common soldiers, Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo. According to Heller, [...] "They are the only two ordinary soldiers mentioned by Caesar in his book, so the idea was to do a sort of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern take. I essentially took the seed of that idea to try to tell a big historical epic, but from the street level, the everyman's point of view." ...|$|E
500|$|Franklin {{argues that}} in modern society, control-related and {{prescriptive}} technologies are dominant. [...] "When work is organized as {{a sequence of}} separately executable steps, the control over the work moves to the organizer, the boss or manager," [...] she writes. [...] "In political terms, prescriptive technologies are designs for compliance." [...] For Franklin, workers accustomed to following prescriptive rules become used to seeing external control and internal compliance as normal and necessary. They also {{come to believe that}} there is only one prescribed way of performing a wide variety of tasks. [...] "While we should not forget that these prescriptive technologies are often exceedingly effective and efficient, they come with an enormous social mortgage. The mortgage means <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> in a culture of compliance, that we are ever more conditioned to accept orthodoxy as normal, and to accept {{that there is only one}} way of doing 'it'." ...|$|E

500|$|Peirce {{wanted to}} tell the story from Brandon's perspective.

People were focusing on the spectacle of a girl who had passed as a boy because that is so unfamiliar to so many people. Where to me, I knew girls who had passed as boys, so Brandon was not some weird person to me. Brandon was a very familiar person." [...] Peirce was influenced by the public perception of the case, believing the American public were generally misinformed: she said, [...] "People were also focusing on the crime without giving it much emotional understanding and I think that's really dangerous, especially with this culture of violence <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> in". Peirce began working on a concept for the film and gave it the working title Take It Like a Man.|$|E
500|$|... "Bass Down Low" [...] {{was written}} by Dev {{alongside}} the production duo The Cataracs. The duo also produced the song, and recorded it at The Indie-Pop Sweat Shop. It was later mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Studios and mastered by Tom Coyne at Sterling Sound in New York City. The song was originally conceived with Dev as a featured act, but she was later made the main artist as they believed it represented her. Dev described [...] "Bass Down Low" [...] as [...] "sassy and fun" [...] and considered it a great follow-up to [...] "Like a G6". In an interview with teen magazine Seventeen, she spoke of the song's conception, stating: [...] "We'd been in the studio writing some really bossy, fun stuff. We've got a studio in the loft <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> in together, so it was made in there. We were just kind of kickin' it and it came.

500|$|The book {{received}} mixed reviews. Caroline Foulkes {{wrote in}} The Birmingham Post: [...] "The {{thing about this}} biography is the depths to which Taraborrelli has dug to get information on a famously controlling woman. He relates revealing anecdotes {{as if they were}} mere bagatelle, making News of the World style revelations look like kid's stuff. If Taraborrelli were to include in his list of acknowledgments 'thanks to the maid who let me into Madonna's bedroom to raid her underwear drawer', it wouldn't be any great surprise." [...] She also felt that [...] "despite the sensationalism, Taraborrelli's writing style lets him down. Too often it descends into the kind of mush you expect from an airport novel, with the singer coming across more like a character from Shirley Conran's Lace than a real woman." [...] Peter Sobczynski reviewed the book for the Post-Tribune and felt that [...] "the problem with writing an unauthorized tell-all biography is that, in this information-rich world <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> in, by the time a book gets written on somebody, most of the juicy stories are already common knowledge. To make up for that, the tell-all author needs to fill his or her pages with either a thoughtful analysis of the subject at hand, or, frankly, newer and better dirt. Unfortunately, celebrity biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli does neither with his latest concoction, Madonna: An Intimate Biography." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) {{received}} {{rave reviews}} from most music critics. In {{an article for}} The Source, The Ghetto Communicator wrote [...] "This record is harsh, {{but so is the}} world <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> in. For B-boys n'girls who come from the core of the hard, this is the hip-hop album you've been waiting for". Rolling Stones review was decidedly ambivalent, praising the album's sound, but noting that [...] "Wu-Tang... are more ciphers than masterful creations. In refusing to commodify themselves, they leave blank the ultimate canvas—the self." [...] Entertainment Weekly was more enthusiastic, giving the album an A, and writing that [...] "With its rumble jumble of drumbeats, peppered with occasional piano plunking, Enter has a raw, pass-the-mike flavor we haven't heard since rap was pop's best-kept secret." [...] Touré declared of the album, that [...] "This is hip-hop you won't find creeping up the Billboard charts but you will hear booming out of Jeep stereos in all the right neighborhoods." [...] However, Enter the Wu-Tang had surprising chart success, despite its raw, underground sound. It peaked at number 41 on the Billboard 200 chart and reached number eight on Billboards Top R/Hip Hop Albums chart. The album continued to sell steadily and was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on May 15, 1995.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} also well {{received}} by former King Crimson member Greg Lake, the original lead vocalist and bassist on [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man." [...] When {{asked for his}} own stance on sampling during an interview with O2 Academy, Lake gave a positive response. He stated, [...] "What I was pleased with was, is the relevance of '21st Century Schizoid Man' today.' You know, it still sounds current. It still sounds relevant. That’s really gratifying after all of these years. I mean, that record is what — 40, 50 years old? I don’t know, but very old. Old like me! But it’s lovely to hear a really contemporary artist doing it." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Lake further commented, [...] "In a way, that song still sounds modern to me. I think when you hear Kanye West do it, or include {{it in his own}} song, it's relevant. He's speaking about that crazy world <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> in. It's as true now as it was then. It's an honor when something like that happens." [...] Due in part to West's usage, [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man" [...] has since became a favorite of Lake, who became known for opening each of his one-man shows by performing the song during his 2012 Songs of a Lifetime theatre tour. Lake went into detail regarding a typical performance of [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man" [...] at his concerts: ...|$|E
500|$|While some reviewers {{regard the}} novel as a thriller, others {{see it as an}} example of post-millennial science fiction with stories set in the [...] "technocultural future-present". Some reviewers note that the novel furthers the post-millennial trend in science fiction of {{illustrating}} society's inability to imagine a definitive future and the use of technologies once considered advanced or academic now commonplace within society and its vernacular. Gibson said that the only science fiction elements are [...] "he Footage and Cayce's special talents" [...] but that he [...] "never bought that conceit that science fiction is about the future". Dennis Danvers explained the use of science fiction as a narrative strategy: cience fiction, in effect, has become a narrative strategy, a way of approaching story, in which not only characters must be invented, but the world and its ways as well, without resorting to magic or the supernatural, where the fantasy folks work. A realist wrestling with the woes of the middle class can leave the world out of it by and large except for an occasional swipe at the shallowness of suburbia. A science fiction writer must invent the world where the story takes place, often from the ground up, a process usually called world-building. In other words, in a science fiction novel, the world itself is a distinctive and crucial character in the plot, without whom the story could not take place, whether it's the world of Dune or Neuromancer or 1984. The world is the story as much as the story is in the world. Part of Gibson's point ... is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> in a time of such accelerated change and layered realities, that we're all in that boat, like it or not. A novel set in the [...] "real world" [...] now has to answer the question, [...] "Which one?" ...|$|E

500|$|The writers {{felt this}} {{approach}} was similar to how Stan Lee reinvented Captain America in the 1960s and 1970s, with [...] "the Captain dealing {{with all sorts of}} the same things that the country [...] dealing with–Vietnam, Watergate and all that stuff–so he gets to have opinions on that", thus making the [...] "guy who is ostensibly from the more black and white 1940s react to this ultimately grey world <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> in." [...] Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige described the film as a political thriller, and as the duo struggled to figure out a third act, Feige suggested that S.H.I.E.L.D. be brought down and have Captain America fight the agency. The writers thought this was a great story point, for implementing [...] "the physical manifestation of Cap changing the world." [...] Markus even noted how the 1970s comics had similar conspiracies. The Hydra reveal made sure to include returning characters among the undercover villains, as well as references to the comics such as Arnim Zola being kept alive as a machine. Feige later elaborated on the political thriller nature of the film saying, In our attempt to make all of our films feel unique and feel different we found ourselves going back to things like [...] Also the other political thrillers of the '70s: The Parallax View, All the President's Men. This was a time that Cap existed in the comics. He found himself in the swinging '60s followed by the Watergate Era followed by the Reagan Era followed by where we are today. In the comics it {{was a hell of a}} journey for Steve. And we couldn't take him through those years because in our cinematic universe he was asleep. But we wanted to force him to confront that kind of moral conundrum, something with that '70s flavor. And in our film that takes the form of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E
