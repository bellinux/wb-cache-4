5|$|Anderson {{ordered his}} men not to harass <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>on</b> the train, but the guerrillas robbed {{all of the}} men, finding over $9,000 and taking the soldiers' uniforms. Anderson forced the {{captured}} Union soldiers to form a line and {{announced that he would}} keep one for a prisoner exchange, but would execute the rest. He addressed the prisoners, castigating them for the treatment of guerrillas by Union troops. After selecting a sergeant for a potential prisoner swap, Anderson's men shot the rest. Anderson gave the civilian hostages permission to leave but warned them not to put out fires or move bodies. Although he was alerted of the congressman's presence in the town, he opted not to search for him. The guerrillas set the passenger train on fire and derailed an approaching freight train. Anderson's band then rode back to their camp, taking a large amount of looted goods.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, Matilda Joslyn Gage {{took time}} {{out from her}} {{participation}} in the Revising Committee to write Woman, Church and State, a book which challenged traditional Judeo-Christian teaching that women were the source of sin, and that sex was sinful. Gage wrote that the double standard for morality hurt both sexes. Gage differed from most of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>on</b> the Revising Committee in {{that she did not}} feel that the Bible, once interpreted in a more true, original form, would support women's rights. Gage determined that the Church had acted against women's interests in important ways: from Roman Catholic canon law, to Scripture, to its advocacy of celibacy and more. Especially troubling to Gage was the story of Adam and Eve.|$|E

25|$|In Orthodox synagogues, {{the dancing}} is mainly {{carried out by}} men and boys; {{children}} (even young girls) may also dance with their fathers. Women and older girls often have their own dancing circles sometimes with the Torah scrolls, or look on {{from the other side}} of a mechitza (partition), in accordance with the value of tzniut (modesty). In 2014, an Israeli modern Orthodox rabbinical organization called Beit Hillel ruled that women are permitted to dance with a Torah scroll on Simchat Torah. They also recommended in their ruling designating a woman as the kallah Torah, or bride of the Torah, just as a man is designated as the chatan Torah, or groom of the Torah, and making sure there is enough dance space for the women, as well as consulting with <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>on</b> the songs that will be sung.|$|E
