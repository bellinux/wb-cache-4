5|$|Bo Xilai's {{political}} fortunes came <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> <b>end</b> {{when his}} police chief, Wang Lijun, {{fled to the}} American consulate in Chengdu hoping to gain political asylum. Wang reportedly provided the consulate with information on Bo's alleged misconduct, including his role obstructing investigations into the homicide of British citizen and Bo family associate Neil Heywood. In the fallout, Bo was removed as Chongqing party chief in March 2012 and suspended from the politburo in April 2012.|$|E
5|$|Bo was {{considered}} a likely candidate for promotion to the elite Politburo Standing Committee in 18th Party Congress in 2012. His political fortunes came <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> <b>end</b> following the Wang Lijun incident, in which his top lieutenant and police chief sought asylum at the American consulate in Chengdu. Wang claimed to have information about the involvement of Bo Xilai and his wife Gu Kailai {{in the murder of}} British businessman Neil Heywood, who allegedly had close financial ties to the two.|$|E
5|$|Sviatoslav's {{campaign}} {{brought the}} prosperity and independence of Khazaria <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> <b>end.</b> The destruction of Khazar imperial power {{paved the way}} for Kievan Rus' to dominate north-south trade routes through the steppe and across the Black Sea, routes that formerly had been a major source of revenue for the Khazars. Moreover, Sviatoslav's campaigns led to increased Slavic settlement in the region of the Saltovo-Mayaki culture, greatly changing the demographics and culture of the transitional area between the forest and the steppe.|$|E

5|$|The {{idealization}} of Tamar {{was further}} accentuated {{by the events}} that took place under her immediate successors; within two decades of Tamar's death, the Khwarezmian and Mongol invasions brought Georgian ascendancy <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> <b>end.</b> Later periods of national revival were too ephemeral to match the achievements of Tamar's reign. All of these contributed to the cult of Tamar which blurred {{the distinction between the}} idealized queen and the real personality.|$|E

5|$|After the Danish Reformation, {{involving}} {{the suppression of}} the Catholic bishopric in 1536, the city enjoyed a sustained period of prosperity from the 1530s to the mid-17th century, becoming northern Funen's commercial centre. One of the main sources of income was the sale of cattle, providing substantial funds for the construction of fine half-timbered houses for the local merchants. The local nobility also participated in the city's development by building residences where they spent the winter months. But the city's prosperity came <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> <b>end</b> in the late 1650s heavy taxes were imposed {{after the end of the}} Swedish Wars. A period of stagnation ensued until the end of the 18th century.|$|E

In the meantime, Principal Seymour Skinner and Edna Krabappel attend and have a conversation which leads to them discovering that they have romantic feelings for each other. They end up kissing in Martin's pink playhouse in an act witnessed by Bart Simpson, who did not get sick since he fed his oysters to Martin's cat, along with Lisa who feigns sickness so she could leave without excuse.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle has}} been {{described}} {{as one of the most}} decisive of the ancient world. The forces of Athens and Thebes were destroyed, and continued resistance was impossible; the war therefore came <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> <b>end.</b> Philip was able to impose a settlement upon Greece, which all states accepted, with the exception of Sparta. The League of Corinth, formed as a result, made all participants allies of Macedon and each other, with Philip as the guarantor of the peace. In turn, Philip was voted as strategos (general) for a pan-Hellenic war against the Persian Empire, which he had long planned. However, before he was able to take charge of the campaign, Philip was assassinated, and the kingdom of Macedon and responsibility for the war with Persia passed instead to his son Alexander.|$|E
5|$|The {{design was}} reimagined in 1944, {{intended}} to operate {{along with the}} s and proposed aircraft carriers to make up powerful task forces able to challenge the American fleet. In this role it {{would need to be}} a more powerful ship than the original design, taking over for the now-cancelled Kronstadts. They were intended to fend off enemy attacks and protect the carriers when bad weather prevented flying. A series of at least four were planned, and Stalingrad finally began construction in 1951. Supported primarily by Joseph Stalin and opposed by a considerable part of the naval staff, the project came <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> <b>end</b> with his death in 1953. By this time a second example was under construction and abandoned on the slipway, while a third was never started. The partially completed Stalingrad ended as a target ship for testing anti-ship missiles, before being broken up around 1962.|$|E
25|$|The Aeneid, {{like other}} {{classical}} epics, {{is written in}} dactylic hexameters: each line consists of six metrical feet made up of dactyls (one long syllable followed by two short syllables) and spondees (two long syllables). This epic consists of twelve books, and the narrative is broken up into three sections of four books each, respectively addressing Dido; the Trojans' arrival in Italy; and the war with the Latins. Each book has about 1000 lines. The Aeneid comes <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> <b>ending,</b> and scholars have speculated that Virgil died before he could finish the poem.|$|R

5|$|During 1928–1973, the Soviet Union {{was growing}} {{economically}} {{at a pace}} that would eventually catch up with the United States and Western Europe. This was true despite the advantage the United States had — the USSR was hampered by the effects of World War II, which had left most of Western USSR in ruins. In 1973, the process of catching up {{with the rest of the}} West came <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> <b>end,</b> and 1973 was seen by some scholars as the start of the Era of Stagnation. The beginning of the stagnation coincided with a financial crisis in Western Europe and the U.S. By the early 1970s, the Soviet Union had the world's second largest industrial capacity, and produced more steel, oil, pig-iron, cement and tractors than any other country. Before 1973, the Soviet economy was expanding at faster rate than that of the American economy (albeit by a very small margin). The USSR also kept a steady pace with the economies of Western Europe. Between 1964 and 1973, the Soviet economy stood at roughly half the output per head of Western Europe and a little more than one third that of the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Karađorđe's {{descendants}} {{adopted the}} surname Karađorđević in his honour. His murder {{resulted in a}} violent, decades-long feud between his descendants and those of Obrenović, with the Serbian throne changing hands several times. The feud came <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> <b>end</b> in June 1903, when rebellious Royal Serbian Army officers killed the Obrenović king, Alexander, and his wife, Queen Draga, thereby rendering the Obrenović line extinct. Karađorđe's grandson, Peter Karađorđević, then ascended to the throne. In order to tie himself to his grandfather's legacy, Peter commissioned a bronze crown cast from a piece of Karađorđe's first cannon. In addition, the Order of Karađorđe's Star was introduced as Serbia's highest state decoration. The first feature-length film to emerge from Serbia and the Balkans, whose plot revolves around Karađorđe and his actions before, {{during and after the}} First Serbian Uprising, was released in 1911. Work soon began on the construction of the Church of Saint George, a Karađorđević dynasty mausoleum at Oplenac, near Topola. In 1923, Karađorđe's head was repatriated from Greece and reunited {{with the rest of his}} body. His remains were buried in a white marble sarcophagus within the church in 1930.|$|E
5|$|By 1871 Burnside {{had grown}} significantly; {{it was now}} a mix of villages {{supporting}} a modest population of 1,557. By comparison, Kensington-Norwood, though smaller in area, had grown to 5,132 persons. Glen Osmond, still affected by its immense growth following the expansion of mining, was the largest single population centre with 343 residents. The District Council had also constructed its first council chambers in December 1869, finally concluding the haphazard meeting agreement. Two villages, Beulah Park (North Kensington) and Eastwood experienced booms in population growth and development between 1870 and 1880, providing both housing to new immigrants and investments for the wealthy Adelaide Establishment. Parkside Hospital (now Glenside), a mental health asylum was constructed in 1866 to replace a crowded building in the Parklands. Built on beautifully tended grounds and with an elaborate façade, it was an early Burnside architectural monument. In 1881 Thomas Cooper started brewing South Australia's first branded beer, 'Coopers', at Leabrook. During this era, Stonyfell saw economic expansion as well; its large quarry changed hands in 1867 and the Stonyfell Olive Co was founded in 1873. The late 19th century was a significant time of development in Burnside. This development, however, was brought <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> <b>end</b> in the last decade, the 1890s, when depression stuck the economies of Australasia after decades of reckless expansion, hitting Burnside hard.|$|E

5|$|Some {{important}} roads {{cross the}} site of the new city. Most important of these is Watling Street from London to Chester. Originally, the Northampton to London road joined the Watling Street at Fenny Stratford, via Broughton and Simpson. The Oxford to Cambridge route came through Stony Stratford, Wolverton and Newport Pagnell. Unfortunately, the heavy clay soils, poor drainage and many streams made these routes frequently impassable in winter. The Hockliffe to Dunchurch stretch of Watling Street became a (paved) Turnpike in 1706 (the first turnpike to be approved by parliament). Simpson remained a quagmire and in 1870 the new Northampton/London turnpike diverted away at Broughton to take the higher route through Wavendon and Woburn Sands to join Watling Street near Hockliffe. On the east/west route, the Stony Stratford to Newport Pagnell turnpike of 1814 extended the Woodstock, Oxfordshire/Bicester/Stony Stratford turnpike of 1768. Turnpikes provided a major boost to the economy of Fenny Stratford and particularly Stony Stratford. In the stage coach era, Stony Stratford was a major resting place and exchange point with the east/west route. In the early 19th century, over 30 coaches a day stopped here. That traffic came <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> <b>end</b> in 1838 when the London–Birmingham Railway (now the West Coast Main Line) opened at nearby Wolverton.|$|E
