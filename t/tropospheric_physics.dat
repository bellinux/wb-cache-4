40|$|This {{study will}} {{document}} {{the behavior of}} the polar vortices in two versions of the GEOS CCM. Both versions of the model include the same stratospheric chemistry, They differ in the underlying circulation model. Version 1 of the GEOS CCM is based on the Goddard Earth Observing System, Version 4, general circulation model which includes the finite-volume (Lin-Rood) dynamical core and physical parameterizations from Community Climate Model, Version 3. GEOS CCM Version 2 is based on the GEOS- 5 GCM that includes a different <b>tropospheric</b> <b>physics</b> package. Baseline simulations of both models, performed at two-degree spatial resolution, show some improvements in Version 2, but also some degradation, In the Antarctic, both models show an over-persistent stratospheric polar vortex with late breakdown, but the year-to-year variations that are overestimated in Version I are more realistic in Version 2. The implications of this for the interactions with tropospheric climate, the Southern Annular Mode, will be discussed. In the Arctic both model versions show a dominant dynamically forced variabi;ity, but Version 2 has a persistent warm bias in the low stratosphere and there are seasonal differences in the simulations. These differences will be quantified in terms of climate change and ozone loss. Impacts of model resolution, using simulations at one-degree and half-degree, and changes in physical parameterizations (especially the gravity wave drag) will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|As part of NASA's {{support for}} the Terra satellite, which became {{operational}} in January 2000, the Data Assimilation Office introduced {{a new version of}} the GEOS data assimilation system (DAS) in November 1999. This system, GEOS- 3 /Terra, differs from its predecessor in several ways, notably through an increase in horizontal resolution (from 2 -by- 2. 5 degrees to 1 -by- 1 degree), a slightly lower upper boundary (0. 1 instead of 0. 01 hPa) with fewer levels (48 as opposed to 70), and substantial changes to the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>physics</b> package. This paper will address the performance of the GEOS- 3 /Terra DAS in the stratosphere. it focusses on the analyses (produced four times daily) and the five-day forecasts (produced twice daily). These were important for the meteorological support of the SAGE- 3 Ozone Loss and Validation Experiment, based in Kiruna, Northern Sweden, in the winter of 1999 / 2000. It is shown that the analyses of basic meteorological fields (temperature, geopotential height, and horizontal wind) are in good agreement with those from other centers. The analyses captured the cold polar vortex which persisted through most of the winter. It is shown that forecasts (up to five days) tend to have a warm bias, which is important for the prediction of polar stratospheric clouds, which are triggered by temperatures of 195 K (or lower). The importance of accurate upper tropospheric forecasts in predicting the stratospheric flow is highlighted in the context of the evolution of the shape of the stratospheric polar vortex. A prominent blocking high in the Atlantic region in January was an important factor determining the shape of the distorted lower stratospheric vortex; the predictive skill of these features was strongly coupled in the GEOS- 3 /Terra system...|$|E
30|$|For De 3 in August (Figure  4 B), {{both the}} latitude-height {{distribution}} and the maximum amplitude of the De 3 compare very well between eCMAM 30 and SABER. The maximum is located between 0 ° and 30 ° S in both data and at 105 km in eCMAM 30 and 105 to 110 km in SABER. A secondary maximum is present between 30 ° N and 60 ° N at 110 km for eCMAM 30, while SABER shows a broad feature from 50 ° S to 50 ° N. The maximum amplitude of De 3 is 18 K for both eCMAM 30 and SABER. Another interesting feature {{is that the}} maximum feature at 105 km extends to 0 ° to 30 ° N at 70 to 80 km and to 0 ° to 30 ° S at 40 to 70 km in both eCMAM 30 and SABER. The phase is decreasing with height above 75 km and stays constant below 75 km in both data, indicating upward propagating and locally trapped modes, respectively. Similar vertical wavelengths for the observed and modeled De 3 are seen in the 80 - to 110 -km-height region where the amplitudes are largest. Forbes et al. (2006) compared the height versus latitude amplitude distribution of De 3 derived from SABER during July and September 2002 with three model results. The three models are the climatological global-scale wave model (GSWM), the GSWM/NCEP (the GSWM utilizes heating rates from the NCAR/NCEP Reanalysis Project), and the Kyushu GCM with full <b>tropospheric</b> <b>physics</b> with heating rates from the NCAR/NCEP reanalysis. All three models predict very similar latitude-height distribution as SABER, but the amplitude is either a factor of 2 too low (GSWM and Kyushu GCM) or 2 too large (GSWM/NCEP). The amplitude peaks at different altitudes for the models and SABER as well. The differences were contributed to possible differences between the De 3 vertical wavelengths and molecular viscosity profiles in the models and in the atmosphere.|$|E
