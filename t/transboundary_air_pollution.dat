The post WWII environmental policy followed in this region has been radically different from the tendencies followed in Western Europe. While in both regions the industrial development has been the main goal, the lack of conservation regulations at the Eastern European countries has resulted in a rather harmful industrialization, regarding natural resources and environmental quality. In the meanwhile, Europe experienced the severe consequences of the <b>transboundary</b> transfer of <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> with sensitive ecosystems of the continent being devastated. The European Monitoring and Evaluation Program has published data regarding the transboundary transfer of nitrogen oxides throughout the European continent in the course of over 15 years. The present study utilises these data, focusing on the contribution of the new member-states to the environmental pressure faced by the older member states and vice versa, in order to analyse the situation and discuss the present and future environmental policy concerning <b>air</b> <b>pollution...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceAlongside other {{countries}} that are signatories to the UNECE Convention Long Range <b>Transboundary</b> on <b>Air</b> <b>Pollution,</b> the UK is committed to reducing the impact of <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> on the environment. To advise and guide this policy in relation to atmospheric emissions of sulphur and nitrogen, a critical load approach has been developed. To assess {{the potential impact of}} these pollutants on woodland habitats a steady state, simple mass balance model has been parameterised. For mineral soils, a Ca:Al ratio in soil solution has been used as the critical load indicator for potential damage. For peat and organic soils critical loads have been set according to a pH criterion. Together these approaches have been used with national datasets to examine the potential scale of acidification in woodland habitats across the UK. The results can be mapped to show the spatial variability in critical loads of the three principal woodland habitat types (managed coniferous, managed broadleaved/ mixed woodland and unmanaged woodland). The results suggest that there is a wide range of critical loads. The most sensitive (lowest) critical loads are associated with managed coniferous followed by unmanaged woodland on peat soils. Calculations indicate that at steady state, acid deposition inputs reported for 1995 ? 1997 result in a large proportion of all the woodland habitats identified receiving deposition loads in excess of their critical load; i. e. critical loads are exceeded. These are discussed in relation to future modelled depositions for 2010. Whilst significant widespread negative impacts of such deposition on UK woodland habitats have not been reported, the work serves to illustrate that if acid deposition inputs were maintained and projected emissions reductions not achieved, the long-term sustainability of large areas of woodland in the UK could be compromised.

30|$|Background, aim {{and scope}} Since 1990, the UN ECE Heavy Metals in Mosses Surveys provide data {{inventories}} of the atmospheric heavy metal bioaccumulation across national boundaries in Europe. The results prove how <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> control in Germany and in all of Europe affected the bioaccumulation of metals in those ecosystems that are not directly influenced by nearby emission sources. This article focuses on the assessment of spatiotemporal patterns of the metal bioaccumulation in Germany since 1990. Furthermore, the spatial variance of the metal bioaccumulation is analysed with regard to sampling site-specific and regional land characteristics. Special focus hereby relies on the correlation of the metal concentration in mosses and in depositions. Hence, the moss surveys contribute to §[*] 12 of the German Federal Nature Conservation Act {{as well as to}} the “Convention on Long-range <b>Transboundary</b> <b>Air</b> Pollution” (CLRTAP).|$|R
40|$|Perhaps like {{no other}} country, Germany has radically changed its {{policies}} towards regulating <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> in the European context. Acting originally as a dragger in the 1970 s to regulate <b>transboundary</b> <b>air</b> pollutants due to pessimism {{about the relationship between}} causes and effects, Germany responded very decisively to its own damage assessment in the early 1980 s. In particular the adverse effects to forests ('Waldsterben' or forest decline) led to the formulation of strict <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> regulations in the domestic context, efforts to spread the regulatory system within the European Union, and activities within the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe to foster stronger, continent-wide emission reductions. Using three conceptual models (rational actor, domestic politics, and social learning), we show that Germany deviated strongly from the ideal policy cycle consisting of (i) domestic policy formulation, (ii) international negotiations, as well as (iii) implementation and compliance with the provisions of international environmental agreements. Both national policy-making as well as partial implementation have been well on the way towards compliance even before Germany entered international negotiations on substantive protocols. Therefore, one may conclude from this country study that push countries may use the results of their national policy processes to influence the policy of other countries. (orig.)

Methods Cross-sectional data from the Oslo Health Study (2000 – 2001) were linked with GIS-modeled <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> data from the Norwegian Institute of Air Research. Multivariate regression analyses were performed. 14 294 persons aged 30, 40, 45, 60 or 75 years old with complete information on modeled and self reported <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> were included. Results People who reported <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> problems were exposed to significantly higher GIS-modeled <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> levels {{than those who did}} not report such problems. People with chronic disease, reported significantly more <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> problems after adjustment for modeled levels of nitrogen dioxides, socio-demographic variables, smoking, depression, dwelling conditions and an area deprivation index, even if they had a non-respiratory disease. No diseases, however, were significantly associated with levels of nitrogen dioxides.

Mortality and morbidity rates from all causes were higher than {{in the rest of the}} province. Anomalously high rates of diseases included various cancers; endocrine, nutritional, metabolic, and immunity disorders; diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs, nervous system and sense organs, circulatory and respiratory systems, digestive system, genitourinary system, skin and subcutaneous tissue, musculoskeletal system and connective tissues; congenital anomalies, and infant mortality. Of particular concern was the early onset of the elevated rates of many of these diseases and conditions. Comparison of these incident rates with those in Hamilton, another industrial municipality in southern Ontario, suggested that in addition to a variety of local sources of industrial pollution from automobile manufacturing and use, <b>transboundary</b> <b>air</b> and water <b>pollution</b> from Detroit, Michigan, should be investigated as potentially important causes of these health outcomes in the Windsor Area of Concern. Some of the institutional and political trends of the past decade may need to be reversed before effective remedial programs are implemented for cleaning up contaminated sediments and for containment of leaking hazardous waste sites.
