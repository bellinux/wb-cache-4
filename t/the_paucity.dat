5|$|Because of <b>the</b> <b>paucity</b> of {{surviving}} attributed works, {{it is difficult}} to detect any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of attributed works indicate that his development was not linear, suggesting that the more advanced Presentation in the Temple is of 1445, predating the more Gothic Saints panels now divided between London and Cologne.|$|E
5|$|Microbiology {{was largely}} ignored by early {{evolutionary}} theory. This {{was due to}} <b>the</b> <b>paucity</b> of morphological traits {{and the lack of}} a species concept in microbiology, particularly amongst prokaryotes. Now, evolutionary researchers are taking advantage of their improved understanding of microbial physiology and ecology, produced by the comparative ease of microbial genomics, to explore the taxonomy and evolution of these organisms. These studies are revealing unanticipated levels of diversity amongst microbes.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{bigeye sand tiger}} is {{encountered}} so infrequently, it has no commercial importance. It {{is caught}} incidentally on longlines and in gillnets and purse seines, though <b>the</b> <b>paucity</b> of captures suggest that it mostly lives in waters too deep for commercial fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient, citing a lack of biological and population data. Since 1997, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has prohibited the taking of this species in United States waters.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{tradition}} which started with Userkaf, {{the founder of}} the Fifth Dynasty, Menkauhor built a temple to the sun god Ra. He was the last pharaoh to do so. His successors, Djedkare Isesi and Unas, abandoned this practice as the cult of Ra declined at the expense of that of Osiris. Given <b>the</b> <b>paucity</b> of documents relating to Menkauhor's sun temple, it probably functioned for only a short time or was never completed.|$|E
5|$|It is {{most likely}} that the three assemblages mark organisms adapted to {{survival}} in different environments, and that any apparent patterns in diversity or age are in fact an artefact of the few samples that have been discovered – the timeline (right) demonstrates <b>the</b> <b>paucity</b> of Ediacaran fossil-bearing assemblages. An analysis {{of one of the}} White Sea fossil beds, where the layers cycle from continental seabed to inter-tidal to estuarine and back again a few times, found that a specific set of Ediacaran organisms was associated with each environment.|$|E
5|$|Otto Pächt and Friedrich Winkler {{continued}} and developed on Panofsky's work. They were key in identifying sources of iconography and ascribing attribution, {{or at least}} differentiating anonymous masters under names of convenience. <b>The</b> <b>paucity</b> of surviving documentation has made attribution especially difficult, a problem compounded by the workshop system. It {{was not until the}} late 1950s, after the research of Friedländer, Panofsky and Meyer Schapiro, that the attributions generally accepted today were established.|$|E

5|$|Stein's {{formulation}} {{has been}} criticized by historian Sanjay Subrahmanyam, in part, {{on account of the}} lack of extensive historiography for the period. The 18th-century Wodeyar rulers of Mysore—in contrast to their contemporaries in Rajputana, Central India, Maratha Deccan, and Tanjavur—left little or no record of their administrations. Surveying the historiography, Subrahmanyam, says:A major problem attendant on such generalisations by modern historians concerning pre-1760 Mysore is, however, <b>the</b> <b>paucity</b> of documentation on this older 'Old Regime'.|$|E
5|$|The {{accuracy}} of the Egyptian artillery strikes alerted the Israelis, who attacked the strong point at the pumping station with armor and seized it. Instead of concentrating forces for a counter-attack, the battalion commander used only the forces originally assigned to the strong point in a counter-attack to regain it, which inevitably failed due to <b>the</b> <b>paucity</b> of forces. Meanwhile, the 81st Battalion reached Serabaeum where they established defenses, mainly at a position south of the railway station, at a hill called Orcha by the Israelis. At this point, only these two paratrooper battalions were positioned between Sharon's division and the Ismailia Canal.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} that Edward {{had a sexual}} relationship with Gaveston or his later favourites has been extensively discussed by historians, complicated by <b>the</b> <b>paucity</b> of surviving evidence to determine for certain the details of their relationships. Homosexuality was fiercely condemned by the Church in 14th-century England, which equated it with heresy, but engaging in sex with another man did not necessarily define an individual's personal identity {{in the same way that}} it might in the 21st century. Edward and Gaveston both had sexual relationships with their wives, who bore them children; Edward also had an illegitimate son, and may also have had an affair with his niece, Eleanor de Clare.|$|E

50|$|Maximum Entropy {{thermodynamics}} {{has generally}} failed {{to be accepted}} by the majority of scientists, with mainstream thermodynamicists considering Jaynes' work as an unfounded mathematical contrivance.

5|$|The task of {{incorporating}} eastern Honduras into the Spanish Empire {{fell to the}} evangelising efforts of Spanish missionary orders. The earliest Franciscan missionaries, {{at the beginning of}} the 17th century, attempted to convert the natives in their own settlements. It soon became obvious that this was impractical, given <b>the</b> <b>paucity</b> of available missionaries, and the wide dispersal of Indian villages and towns. The friars changed their tactics, and gathered the natives in mission towns, known as reducciones.|$|E
5|$|There are few {{surviving}} {{sources on}} Caligula and no surviving source paints Caligula in a favourable light. <b>The</b> <b>paucity</b> of sources {{has resulted in}} significant gaps in modern knowledge {{of the reign of}} Caligula. Little is written on {{the first two years of}} Caligula's reign. Additionally, there are only limited details on later significant events, such as the annexation of Mauretania, Caligula's military actions in Britannia, and his feud with the Roman Senate.|$|E
5|$|Very few {{historical}} sources give detailed {{accounts of}} the battle {{and they do not}} describe the exact deployments of the armies. <b>The</b> <b>paucity</b> of such primary sources led early historians to adopt Hall's chronicle as their main resource for the engagement, despite its authorship 70years after the event and questions over the origin of his information. The Burgundian chronicler Jehan de Waurin (13981474) was a more contemporary source, but his chronicle was made available to the public only from 1891, and several mistakes in it discouraged historians at that time from using it. Later reconstructions of the battle were based on Hall's version, supplemented by minor details from other sources.|$|E
50|$|Reduced {{availability}} of baitfish species {{is known to}} impact seabird populations.

5|$|Despite some concerns, western vegetarians and vegans do {{not suffer}} any more from overt zinc {{deficiency}} than meat-eaters. Major plant sources of zinc include cooked dried beans, sea vegetables, fortified cereals, soy foods, nuts, peas, and seeds. However, phytates in many whole-grains and fibers {{may interfere with}} zinc absorption and marginal zinc intake has poorly understood effects. The zinc chelator phytate, found in seeds and cereal bran, can contribute to zinc malabsorption. Some evidence suggests that more than the US RDA (15mg) of zinc daily may be needed in those whose diet is high in phytates, such as some vegetarians. These considerations must be balanced against <b>the</b> <b>paucity</b> of adequate zinc biomarkers, and {{the most widely used}} indicator, plasma zinc, has poor sensitivity and specificity. Diagnosing zinc deficiency is a persistent challenge.|$|E
5|$|Like other bleeding-hearts, the Sulu bleeding-heart is {{primarily}} a sedentary bird, feeding {{on the forest floor}} and flying only for short distances. Little is known about its behavior due to <b>the</b> <b>paucity</b> of sightings. Searches of Tawi-Tawi in 1971 and 1991 did not discover any evidence of the species' continued existence. Most of the bird's habitat was logged on Tawi-Tawi by 1994. However, an ethnobiological survey in 1995 revealed that the bleeding-heart was common until the 1970s and still survives on small islets near Tawi-Tawi. While another survey in 2009 failed to find the species, there is some hope that it may still persist. For this reason, it is currently listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. Any surviving population would be very small, likely numbering fewer than 50 individuals, and would be threatened by habitat destruction and uncontrolled hunting.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{of the six}} {{missing women}} and Sparks's brutal beating {{appeared}} prominently in newspapers and on television throughout Washington and Oregon. Fear spread among the population; hitchhiking by young women dropped sharply. While pressure mounted on law enforcement agencies, <b>the</b> <b>paucity</b> of physical evidence severely hampered them. Police could not provide reporters with the little information that was available for fear of compromising the investigation. Further similarities between the victims were noted: The disappearances all took place at night, usually near ongoing construction work, {{within a week of}} midterm or final exams; all of the victims were wearing slacks or blue jeans; and at most crime scenes, there were sightings of a man wearing a cast or a sling, and driving a brown or tan Volkswagen Beetle.|$|E
