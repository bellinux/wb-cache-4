25|$|In 2014, Allmand defended a legal argument, {{on behalf}} of the World Federalist Movement – Canada, that {{challenged}} the Canadian government's implementation bill for the Convention on Cluster Munitions. He argued that a clause of the bill was flawed and enabled use of cluster munitions while Canada was participating in combined military operations with allies. Participating in use was a violation of the primary purposes of the convention. Allmand preferred not signing the treaty than passing a flawed version that with a loophole <b>that</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries</b> could also adopt to circumvent its terms.|$|E
25|$|Taipei City is also {{famous for}} its effort in garbage recycling, which {{has become such a}} good {{international}} precedent <b>that</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries</b> have sent teams to study the recycling system. After the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) established a program in 1998 combining the efforts of communities, a financial resource named the Recycling Fund was made available to recycling companies and waste collectors. Manufacturers, vendors and importers of recyclable waste pay fees to the Fund, which uses the money to set firm prices for recyclables and subsidize local recycling efforts. Between 1998 and 2008, the recycling rate increased from 6 percent to 32 percent. This improvement enabled the government of Taipei to demonstrate its recycling system to the world at the Shanghai World Expo 2010.|$|E
25|$|The Kennedy {{administration}} {{was concerned that}} a situation like the Suez Crisis might repeat itself, one that would once again incite a response from the Soviets. The Americans developed a plan to force the UK into the Multilateral Force concept, a dual-key arrangement that would only allow launch if both parties agreed. If those weapons {{were part of a}} single larger force, attacking them would require attacks on the other hosting countries as well, making the prospect far less interesting. The US also feared <b>that</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries</b> would want to follow the UK lead and develop their own deterrent forces, leading to a proliferation problem even among their own allies. If a deterrent was being provided by a larger international force, the need for individual forces would be reduced.|$|E

25|$|Japanese scholar Taoka Shunji criticised Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe {{for trying}} to falsely portray China {{as a threat to}} Japan and that it was invading its {{neighbours}} like the Philippines, and pointed out that the Spratly islands were not part of the Philippines when the US acquired the Philippines from Spain in the Treaty of Paris in 1898, and the Japanese ruled Taiwan itself had annexed the Spratly islands in 1938 and the US ruled Philippines did not challenge the move and never asserted that it was their territory, he also pointed out <b>that</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries</b> did not need to do full land reclamation since they already control islands and that the reason China engaged in extensive land reclamation is because they needed it to build airfields since China only has control over reefs.|$|E
25|$|The United States also lacks {{an agency}} {{in charge of}} diamond import confirmations, which allows traders to bypass the {{requirement}} of reporting the receipt of the diamond shipment within 15 days of the arrival. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the agency in charge of overseeing incoming diamond shipments and conducting examinations of shipments. There is also little oversight of the U.S. Kimberley Process Authority (USKPA), {{who are responsible for}} issuing Kimberley Process certificates, so no one supervises the company making sure that USKPA adheres to KPCS standards. The closest oversight comes from the Department of State, who “convene periodic teleconferences with the USKPA”. The CDTA also does not directly deal with the retail diamond sector, as the Act only applies to rough diamonds as opposed to cut and polished diamonds. While some retailers take strong initiatives to avoid conflict diamonds, many do not, so the effectiveness of the Act to completely eliminate the trade of conflict diamonds is often questioned. It has also been suggested <b>that</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries</b> have similarly struggled with the implementation of the KPCS.|$|E

The Soviets were not expected to even give the Canadians a challenge, and Canada was going into this series expected to win handily. According to Team Canada Coach Harry Sinden: [...] "Canada is first in the world in two things: hockey and wheat." [...] Alan Eagleson said [...] "We gotta win in eight games. Anything less than an unblemished sweep of the Russians would bring shame down on the heads of the players and the national pride."

Koht reportedly preferred {{to solve a problem}} by himself instead of involving co-workers and employees, even the experts in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

In order to make him eligible for the imperial throne and to enable him {{to vote in the}} imperial elections as elector of Bohemia (which she could not do because of her gender), Maria Theresa made Francis Stephen co-ruler of the Austrian and Bohemian lands on 21November 1740. [...] It took more than a year for the Diet of Hungary to accept Francis Stephen as co-ruler. Despite her love for him and his position as co-ruler, Maria Theresa never allowed her husband to decide matters of state and often dismissed him from council meetings when they disagreed.|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Munich, Chamberlain continued to pursue a course of cautious rearmament. He told the Cabinet in early October 1938, [...] "t would be madness {{for the country to}} stop rearming until we were convinced <b>that</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries</b> would act in the same way. For the time being, therefore, we should relax no particle of effort until our deficiencies had been made good." [...] However, later in October, he resisted calls to put industry on a war footing, convinced that such an action would show Hitler that the Prime Minister had decided to abandon Munich. Chamberlain hoped that the understanding he had signed with Hitler at Munich would lead toward a general settlement of European disputes. However, Hitler expressed no public interest in following up on the accord. Having considered a general election immediately following Munich Chamberlain instead reshuffled his Cabinet. By the end of the year, however, public concerns caused Chamberlain to conclude that [...] "to get rid of this uneasy and disgruntled House of Commons by a General Election" [...] would be [...] "suicidal".|$|E

500|$|The CIA {{operation}} to overthrow Jacobo Árbenz, code-named Operation PBSUCCESS, was authorized by Eisenhower in August 1953. The operation {{was granted a}} budget of 2.7 million dollars for [...] "psychological warfare and political action." [...] The total budget has been estimated at between 5 and 7 million dollars, and the planning employed over 100 CIA agents. The CIA planning included drawing up lists of people within Árbenz' government to be assassinated if the coup were to be carried out. Manuals of assassination techniques were compiled, and lists were also made of people whom the junta would dispose of. After considering several candidates to lead the coup, including Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes, the CIA settled on Carlos Castillo Armas. The US state department also embarked on a campaign to ensure <b>that</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries</b> would not sympathize with the Guatemalan government, by linking it to communism and the Soviet Union. [...] By 1954 Árbenz had become desperate for weapons, and decided to acquire them secretly from Czechoslovakia, {{which would have been}} {{the first time that a}} Soviet bloc country shipped weapons to the Americas. The shipment of these weapons acted as the final spur for the CIA to launch its coup.|$|E
