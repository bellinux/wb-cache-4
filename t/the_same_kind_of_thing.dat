The episode was directed by David Nutter. As Morgan and Wong explained, their episode was written in response to criticisms of the show's initially limited characterization of Scully. Wong said, [...] "Gillian Anderson needed to show off her talents more, {{and this was a}} perfect opportunity to dispel those notions that Scully will never believe. It was time for the character to grow, because she was just doing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> too often."

60|$|Another case of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> can {{be found}} in the latest conceptions of humour. By the {{wholesome}} tradition of mankind, a joke was a thing meant to amuse men; a joke which did not amuse them was a failure, just as a fire which did not warm them was a failure. But we have seen the process of secrecy and aristocracy introduced even into jokes. If a joke falls flat, a small school of æsthetes only ask us to notice the wild grace of its falling and its perfect flatness after its fall. The old idea that the joke was not good enough for the company has been superseded by the new aristocratic idea that the company was not worthy of the joke. They have introduced an almost insane individualism into that one form of intercourse which is specially and uproariously communal. They have made even levities into secrets. They have made laughter lonelier than tears.|$|E
60|$|So {{much for}} why I am an anti-vivisectionist; and I {{should like to}} say, in conclusion, that all other anti-vivisectionists of my {{acquaintance}} weaken their case infinitely by forming this attack on a scientific speciality in which the human heart is commonly on their side, with attacks upon universal human customs in which the human heart {{is not at all}} on their side. I have heard humanitarians, for instance, speak of vivisection and field sports as if they were <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> The difference seems to me simple and enormous. In sport a man goes into a wood and mixes with the existing life of that wood; becomes a destroyer only in the simple and healthy sense in which all the creatures are destroyers; becomes for one moment to them what they are to him--another animal. In vivisection a man takes a simpler creature and subjects it to subtleties which no one but man could inflict on him, and for which man is therefore gravely and terribly responsible.|$|E
6000|$|If I might {{pursue the}} figure of speech, I might briefly say that the whole Collectivist error {{consists}} in saying that because two men can share an umbrella, therefore two men can share a walking-stick. Umbrellas might possibly be replaced by some kind of common awnings covering certain streets from particular showers. But there is nothing but nonsense {{in the notion of}} swinging a communal stick; it is as if one spoke of twirling a communal mustache. It will be said that this is a frank fantasia and that no sociologists suggest such follies. Pardon me if they do. I will give a precise parallel to the case of confusion of sticks and umbrellas, a parallel from a perpetually reiterated suggestion of reform. At least sixty Socialists out of a hundred, when they have spoken of common laundries, will go on at once to speak of common kitchens. This is just as mechanical and unintelligent as the fanciful case I have quoted. Sticks and umbrellas are both stiff rods that go into holes in a stand in the hall. Kitchens and washhouses are both large rooms full of heat and damp and steam. But the soul and function of the two things are utterly opposite. There is only one way of washing a shirt; that is, there is only one right way. There is no taste and fancy in tattered shirts. Nobody says, [...] "Tompkins likes five holes in his shirt, but I must say, give me the good old four holes." [...] Nobody says, [...] "This washerwoman rips up the left leg of my pyjamas; now if there is one thing I insist on it is the right leg ripped up." [...] The ideal washing is simply to send a thing back washed. But {{it is by no means}} true that the ideal cooking is simply to send a thing back cooked. Cooking is an art; it has in it personality, and even perversity, for the definition of an art is that which must be personal and may be perverse. I know a man, not otherwise dainty, who cannot touch common sausages unless they are almost burned to a coal. He wants his sausages fried to rags, yet he does not insist on his shirts being boiled to rags. I do not say that such points of culinary delicacy are of high importance. I do not say that the communal ideal must give way to them. What I say is that the communal ideal is not conscious of their existence, and therefore goes wrong from the very start, mixing a wholly public thing with a highly individual one. Perhaps we ought to accept communal kitchens in the social crisis, just as we should accept communal cat's-meat in a siege. But the cultured Socialist, quite at his ease, by no means in a siege, talks about communal kitchens as if they were <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> as communal laundries. This shows at the start that he misunderstands human nature. It is as different as three men singing the same chorus from three men playing three tunes on the same piano.|$|E
