40|$|The Narrative Elaboration Technique (NET) is a {{forensic}} interview technique {{that has been}} shown {{to increase the amount of}} information provided by children in open-ended recall. Efforts have been made to streamline the technique for use in real-world settings. The present study examined the effectiveness of two streamlined NET interviews with three <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> <b>year</b> old children. It is the first study to completely omit the NET training session, without substituting a rapport building session, and to test the effectiveness of NET verbal prompts with children younger than six years old. Although NET was not found to be effective at increasing open-ended recall with the younger children in the sample, the streamlined NET interview with verbal prompts proved to be as effective as the full NET interview with five <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> <b>year</b> old children. These verbal prompts could be readily incorporated into forensic interviews...|$|R

5|$|Seeds do {{not require}} any {{treatment}} prior to planting, and take 26 to 40 days to germinate. Seeds that grow into yellow-flowered plants are pale and unpigmented, while future bronze- and red-flowered plants are dark greyish and black respectively. It generally takes about five <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> to flower from seed. The plant favours sandy well-drained soils and a sunny position and can be heavily pruned if necessary, as new growth can arise from the lignotuber. Although it is readily propagated by seed, experiments with in vitro propagation found Banksia menziesii {{to be more difficult}} than other species trialled.|$|E
