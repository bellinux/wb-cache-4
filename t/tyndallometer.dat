The results were analysed and compared in terms of five different concentration parameters, namely, particles plus short fibres (p + sf), long fibres (If), particles plus short fibres plus long fibres (p + sf+ 10, the volume (<b>tyndallometer</b> readings) and the mass of dust (VC 25). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic was used to test for normality and the Bartlett statistic for equality of variance of the transformed concentration data recorded by each type of instrument. Fourteen linear relationships were investigated. In those cases where replicates were given these were used to obtain estimates of the error variances for the predictor and the response variables. With these estimates an additional regression equation to the least squares equation was determined. This new equation is recommended in preference to the corresponding least squares equation, as it is based on information which is discarded when only the position means are used. All but one of the fourteen relationships reached statistical significance. The konimeter and the thermal precipitator can be linked with the membrane filter, the <b>tyndallometer</b> can reveal short time variations in the fibre level and the VC 25 can disclose the asbestos content of the fine dust...|$|E
