The function is the convolution of a detector resolution function with the sum of a delta function, which represents the complete absorption of energy, and a tail function, which describes the partial absorption of energy and depends on the detector materials and structures. Its performance was tested with the simulation of three typical cases. The accuracy of the extracted peak value, resolution, and peak area was improved by {{an order of magnitude}} on average, relative to the Crystal Ball function.

40|$|The {{spectral}} {{distribution of the}} flux of positrons inside a beta radioactive medium was experimentally determined using an anthracene coincidence scintillation spectrometer. Positrons leaving a copper cavity source containing Cu/sup 64 / were absorbed in a thin anthracene crystal. The light pulse from the anthracene was recorded in a 256 channel analyzer if a NaI scintillation spectrometer nearby recorded simultaneously a count under the <b>total</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>peak</b> for annihilation radiation. Thus, discrimination against negative and secondary electrons was obtained which permitted observation of the primary positron slowing down flux. Data were corrected for the non-linear pulse height vs energy relationship in anthracene by a semi-empirical theory due to Birks, the validity of which was demonstrated by its use in obtaining a linear Fermi plot of Pm/sup 147 /. Positron spectra were corrected also for Compton absorption of the annihilation radiation in the anthracene. Results were compared with the theoretical continuous-slowing-down model. Over the energy range measured (20 [...] 650 kev) {{it was concluded that}} the continuous-slowing-down model gives the correct shape for the primary slowing-down spectrum. 43 references.

40|$|A novel {{analysis}} method named peak-to-charge ratio (V-p/Q(total)) discrimination, aiming at background rejection especially for alpha decay self-activity in LaBr 3 :Ce scintillators has been developed. This method {{is based on}} a waveform analysis using the peak-to-charge ratio in the output waveform of a photomultiplier tube. The discrimination of alpha-induced events was achieved by using a threshold function based on the error propagation of the V-p/Q(total) value. The accidental rejection ratio of gamma-induced events was evaluated to be 0. 17 %. Furthermore, a <b>total</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>peak</b> spectrum processed with the V-p/Q(total) discrimination method for Ga- 68 1. 883 MeV gamma rays, where the energy was overlapped with background alpha events, reproduced exactly the same result as that of the background subtraction method. The difference in measured peak counts of both methods was 0. 716 %, and the statistical error in the V-p/Q(total) discrimination method and background subtraction was 4. 81 % and 8. 70 %, respectively. Thus a higher-accuracy measurement could be achieved using the V-p/Q(total) discrimination method. The present study demonstrates that the V-p/Q(total) discrimination method is a promising method for background rejection of the spontaneous alpha decay in LaBr 3 : Ce scintillators.

30|$|As {{the veneer}} {{densification}} temperature increased, the peak values {{for both the}} load/time and energy/time curves presented decreasing trends for the board tested. Taking BLVL without veneer preprocessing densification as the reference sample, the load/time curve was slightly steeper and higher and the energy/time curve slightly lower and gentler for the board manufactured with the 90  °C veneer densification. The values of <b>total</b> <b>absorption</b> energy, <b>peak</b> load, and deflection at peak load were 84.5  J, 10.9  kN, and 14.1  mm for the board fabricated at a veneer densification temperature of 90  °C and 88.7  J, 9.2  kN, and 16.8  mm for the control specimen. These clearly indicated that the impact absorption capacity and impact toughness for the board made with 90  °C veneer densification {{was similar to the}} control BLVL. This is generally related to the low degree of pre-curing for the PF during the 15  min of veneer densification preparation. PF resin has a relatively low curing rate at the preprocessing temperature of 90  °C, as reported by Tang [18]. The load/time and energy/time curves for the densification temperatures of 120 and 150  °C significantly decreased, with the <b>total</b> <b>absorption</b> energies and <b>peak</b> loads at only about 65.7  J, 4.76  kN and 58.84  J, 3.23  kN, respectively. The results concerning impact properties clearly implied that the impact resistance decreased for the boards manufactured at 120 and 150  °C. At higher veneer densification temperatures, the degree of pre-cured PF resin on bamboo bundle veneers increased. So, when these veneers were prepared to fabricate BLVL, the interfaces during veneers would have more degree of being impaired. The amount of micro-cracks generated on the laminated interfaces accelerated the delamination failure of the boards at preprocessing temperatures of 120 and 150  °C. The analysis above was in agreement with previously published data stating that the MOE and MOR of BLVL manufactured at preprocessing temperatures of 90, 100, 120, and 150  °C were reduced by 5.47, 9.77, 14.18, and 49.32  %; and 8.87, 22.86, 48.14, and 71.93  %, respectively [11].|$|R

As indicated by curve (a) in Figure  5 (II), the UV–vis absorption spectrum of pure GO possessed a characteristic <b>absorption</b> <b>peak</b> at 228  nm. On the other hand, a sample of GO hybridized with the PEDOT:PTS during EDOT polymerization [Figure  5 (II), curve (c)] had a strong <b>absorption</b> <b>peak</b> at 268  nm, and no GO <b>absorption</b> <b>peak</b> at 228  nm. Additionally, the <b>total</b> <b>absorption</b> across the entire UV-visible range increased significantly, upon chemical reduction of GO. The disappearance of the characteristic GO peak at 228  nm suggested that the electronic conjugation within GO sheets was restored after the reaction. This is another indication that GO is changed into rGO during polymerization/oxidization of the EDOT monomer. According to previous reports [23, 30], the GO peak at 228  nm shifts to longer wavelengths (268  nm) upon the reduction of GO. However, we were able to show the evidence about reduction of GO by EDOT, as one of the thiophene derivatives, from XRD and UV–vis spectral analysis.|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{efficient}} multiband absorber comprising a truncated one-dimensional periodic metal-dielectric photonic crystal and a reflective substrate. The reflective substrate {{is actually an}} optically thick metallic film. Such a planar device is easier to fabricate compared with the absorbers with complicated shapes.

The influences of the geometrical parameters along with the refractive index of the dielectric on the device performance are discussed as well.

40|$|The renewed {{interest}} in zinc oxide (ZnO) has provided {{a great number of}} details {{that could lead to a}} commercially viable alternative to gallium nitride (GaN) for use in high-efficiency, wide band-gap devices. The difficulty in obtaining such devices is that as-grown, large single crystals of ZnO are n type. Past research has shown that hydrogen plays an important role in the n-type conductivity of ZnO. However, other impurities cannot be eliminated as possible donors in as-grown ZnO. In an attempt to study the controlled doping of ZnO, we grew polycrystalline samples via the chemical vapor transport (CVT) method, using graphite as the transport agent.
