5|$|Here {{constant}} α quantifies {{the strength}} of the interaction between adjacent molecules. The potential is then used to derive the <b>thermodynamic</b> properties of the system assuming thermal equilibrium.

5|$|LeMessurier and Hills {{published}} {{a paper in}} 1965 on A <b>thermodynamic</b> approach arising from a study on Torres Strait diving techniques which suggests that decompression by conventional models results in bubble formation which is then eliminated by re-dissolving at the decompression stops, which is slower than elimination while still in solution, thus indicating the importance of minimising bubble phase for efficient gas elimination.|$|E
5|$|This {{formulation}} {{is a form}} {{of second}} quantization, but it predates modern quantum mechanics. Erwin Schrödinger applied this to derive the <b>thermodynamic</b> properties of a semiclassical ideal gas.

25|$|<b>Thermodynamic</b> {{potentials}} can {{be derived}} from the energy balance equation applied to a <b>thermodynamic</b> system. Other <b>thermodynamic</b> potentials can also be obtained through Legendre transformation.|$|E
25|$|Non-equilibrium {{thermodynamics}} is {{a branch}} of thermodynamics that deals with systems {{that are not in}} <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium. Most systems found in nature are not in <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium because they are not in stationary states, and are continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy to and from other systems. The <b>thermodynamic</b> study of non-equilibrium systems requires more general concepts than are dealt with by equilibrium thermodynamics. Many natural systems still today remain beyond the scope of currently known macroscopic <b>thermodynamic</b> methods.|$|E
25|$|Since U, S and V are <b>thermodynamic</b> {{functions}} of state, the above relation holds also for non-reversible changes. The above equation {{is known as}} the fundamental <b>thermodynamic</b> relation.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} <b>thermodynamic</b> relation implies many <b>thermodynamic</b> identities {{that are}} valid in general, {{independent of the}} microscopic details of the system. Important examples are the Maxwell relations and the relations between heat capacities.|$|E
25|$|This is {{also the}} reason why the zeroth law of {{thermodynamics}} is stated explicitly. If three physical systems, A, B, and C are each not in their own states of internal <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium, it is possible that, with suitable physical connections being made between them, A can heat B and B can heat C and C can heat A. In non-equilibrium situations, cycles of flow are possible. It is the special and uniquely distinguishing characteristic of internal <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium that this possibility is not open to <b>thermodynamic</b> systems (as distinguished amongst physical systems) which are in their own states of internal <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium; this is {{the reason why the}} zeroth law of thermodynamics needs explicit statement. That is to say, the relation 'is not colder than' between general non-equilibrium physical systems is not transitive, whereas, in contrast, the relation 'has no lower a temperature than' between <b>thermodynamic</b> systems in their own states of internal <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium is transitive. It follows from this that the relation 'is in thermal equilibrium with' is transitive, which is one way of stating the zeroth law.|$|E
25|$|In {{the cases}} of <b>thermodynamic</b> {{equilibrium}} and of local <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium, the number densities of the atoms, both excited and unexcited, may be calculated from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, but for other cases, (e.g. lasers) the calculation is more complicated.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} paragraph {{shows how}} melting temperature and <b>thermodynamic</b> parameters (ΔG° or ΔH° & ΔS°) {{are related to}} each other. From the observation of melting temperatures one can experimentally determine the <b>thermodynamic</b> parameters. Vice versa, and important for applications, when the <b>thermodynamic</b> parameters of a given nucleic acid sequence are known, the melting temperature can be predicted. It turns out that for oligonucleotides, these parameters can be well approximated by the nearest-neighbor model.|$|E
25|$|This {{physical}} {{statement is}} restricted neither to closed systems nor to systems with {{states that are}} strictly defined only for <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium; it has meaning also for open systems and for systems with states {{that are not in}} <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|Once in <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium, a system's {{properties}} are, by definition, unchanging in time. Systems in equilibrium {{are much}} simpler {{and easier to}} understand than are systems which are not in equilibrium. Often, when analysing a dynamic <b>thermodynamic</b> process, the simplifying assumption is made that each intermediate state in the process is at equilibrium, producing <b>thermodynamic</b> processes which develop so slowly as to allow each intermediate step to be an equilibrium state and {{are said to be}} reversible processes.|$|E
25|$|The Carnot {{cycle is}} a {{theoretical}} <b>thermodynamic</b> cycle proposed by French physicist Sadi Carnot in 1824 and expanded upon by {{others in the}} 1830s and 1840s. It provides an upper limit on the efficiency that any classical <b>thermodynamic</b> engine can achieve during the conversion of heat into work, or conversely, the efficiency of a refrigeration system in creating a temperature difference (e.g. refrigeration) by the application of work to the system. It is not an actual <b>thermodynamic</b> cycle but is a theoretical construct.|$|E
25|$|Real world {{bodies are}} often not in <b>thermodynamic</b> {{equilibrium}} and not homogeneous. For study by methods of classical irreversible thermodynamics, a body is usually spatially and temporally divided conceptually into 'cells' of small size. If classical <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium conditions for matter are fulfilled to good approximation in such a 'cell', then it is homogeneous and a temperature exists for it. If this is so for every 'cell' of the body, then local <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium is said to prevail throughout the body.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} energy representation and the enthalpy representation are partial Legendre transforms of one another. They contain the same physical information, written in different ways. Like the {{internal energy}}, the enthalpy stated {{as a function}} of its natural variables is a <b>thermodynamic</b> potential and contains all <b>thermodynamic</b> information about a body.|$|E

25|$|The trisubstituted enolate is {{considered}} the kinetic enolate, while the tetrasubstituted enolate {{is considered}} the <b>thermodynamic</b> enolate. The alpha hydrogen deprotonated to form the kinetic enolate is less hindered, and therefore deprotonated more quickly. In general, tetrasubstituted olefins are more stable than trisubstituted olefins due to hyperconjugative stabilization. The ratio of enolate regioisomers is heavily influenced by the choice of base. For the above example, kinetic control may be established with LDA at −78°C, giving 99:1 selectivity of kinetic: <b>thermodynamic</b> enolate, while <b>thermodynamic</b> control may be established with triphenylmethyllithium at room temperature, giving 10:90 selectivity.|$|E
25|$|In {{the view}} of Jaynes (1957), <b>thermodynamic</b> entropy, as {{explained}} by statistical mechanics, {{should be seen as}} an application of Shannon's information theory: the <b>thermodynamic</b> entropy is interpreted as being proportional to the amount of further Shannon information needed to define the detailed microscopic state of the system, that remains uncommunicated by a description solely in terms of the macroscopic variables of classical thermodynamics, with the constant of proportionality being just the Boltzmann constant. For example, adding heat to a system increases its <b>thermodynamic</b> entropy because it increases the number of possible microscopic states of the system that are consistent with the measurable values of its macroscopic variables, thus making any complete state description longer. (See article: maximum entropy thermodynamics). Maxwell's demon can (hypothetically) reduce the <b>thermodynamic</b> entropy of a system by using information about the states of individual molecules; but, as Landauer (from 1961) and co-workers have shown, to function the demon himself must increase <b>thermodynamic</b> entropy in the process, by at least the amount of Shannon information he proposes to first acquire and store; and so the total <b>thermodynamic</b> entropy does not decrease (which resolves the paradox). Landauer's principle imposes a lower bound on the amount of heat a computer must generate to process a given amount of information, though modern computers are far less efficient.|$|E
25|$|The main {{result of}} this paper is that this <b>thermodynamic</b> {{equilibrium}} should be a KMS state. This almost goes without saying; for a quantum system, the KMS condition is just the concrete definition of <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium. The hard part is identifying the quantum system to which the condition should be applied, which is not done in this paper.|$|E
25|$|The {{name and}} {{inspiration}} come from annealing in metallurgy, a technique involving heating and controlled cooling of a material {{to increase the}} size of its crystals and reduce their defects. Both are attributes of the material that depend on its <b>thermodynamic</b> free energy. Heating and cooling the material affects both the temperature and the <b>thermodynamic</b> free energy.|$|E
25|$|The revised {{statement}} of the first law postulates that {{a change in the}} internal energy of a system due to any arbitrary process, that takes the system from a given initial <b>thermodynamic</b> state to a given final equilibrium <b>thermodynamic</b> state, can be determined through the physical existence, for those given states, of a reference process that occurs purely through stages of adiabatic work.|$|E
25|$|This result {{applies to}} homogeneous, {{macroscopic}} systems, {{but not to}} all <b>thermodynamic</b> systems.|$|E

25|$|The {{internal}} energy {{is a state}} function of a system, because its value depends only on {{the current state of}} the system and not on the path taken or processes undergone to prepare it. It is an extensive quantity. It is the one and only cardinal <b>thermodynamic</b> potential. Through it, by use of Legendre transforms, are mathematically constructed the other <b>thermodynamic</b> potentials. These are functions of variable lists in which some extensive variables are replaced by their conjugate intensive variables. Legendre transformation is necessary because mere substitutive replacement of extensive variables by intensive variables does not lead to <b>thermodynamic</b> potentials. Mere substitution leads to a less informative formula, an equation of state.|$|E
25|$|It {{makes good}} sense, for example, to say of the {{extensive}} variable , or {{of the extensive}} variable , {{that it has a}} density per unit volume, or a quantity per unit mass of the system, but {{it makes no sense to}} speak of density of temperature per unit volume or quantity of temperature per unit mass of the system. On the other hand, it makes no sense to speak of the internal energy at a point, while when local <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium prevails, it makes good sense to speak of the temperature at a point. Consequently, temperature can vary from point to point in a medium that is not in global <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium, but in which there is local <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|When {{the heat}} and work {{transfers}} in the equations above are infinitesimal in magnitude, they are often denoted by , rather than exact differentials denoted by , {{as a reminder that}} heat and work do not describe the state of any system. The integral of an inexact differential depends upon the particular path taken through the space of <b>thermodynamic</b> parameters while the integral of an exact differential depends only upon the initial and final states. If the initial and final states are the same, then the integral of an inexact differential {{may or may not be}} zero, but the integral of an exact differential is always zero. The path taken by a <b>thermodynamic</b> system through a chemical or physical change is known as a <b>thermodynamic</b> process.|$|E
25|$|While for {{bodies in}} their own <b>thermodynamic</b> {{equilibrium}} states, the notion of temperature requires that all empirical thermometers must agree as to which of two bodies is the hotter or that {{they are at the}} same temperature, this requirement is not safe for bodies that are in steady states though not in <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium. It can then well be that different empirical thermometers disagree about which is the hotter, and if this is so, then {{at least one of the}} bodies does not have a well defined absolute <b>thermodynamic</b> temperature. Nevertheless, any one given body and any one suitable empirical thermometer can still support notions of empirical, non-absolute, hotness and temperature, for a suitable range of processes. This is a matter for study in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.|$|E
