5|$|In May 1965 the Rhodesian Front {{government}} went to <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{general election}} with Van der Byl {{one of the}} leading campaigners. Discussion of unilaterally declaring independence had already begun. Van der Byl argued that {{only a small fraction of}} Rhodesian business opposed it; however, his campaign speeches typically included an argument against business involvement in politics. He cited Johannesburg mining interests' support for the Progressive Party in South Africa, big business support for the Nazi Party in Germany, and the Bolshevik revolution in Russia being financed by United States big business.|$|E

5|$|Following the Norman {{conquest of}} England in 1066, William the Conqueror subdued {{the north of}} <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{sequence}} of harsh campaigns, and the north-west region became a contested border territory between the Normans and the Scottish kings. William's son, William Rufus, invaded the north-west in 1091 and built Brough Castle around 1092, placing it in the north {{part of the old}} Roman fort in order {{to make use of the}} existing earthworks, in a similar way to nearby Brougham and Lancaster. The north side of the site overlooks the River Eden. This castle appears to have been a motte and bailey design; the keep had stone foundations and a main structure built from timber, while the rest of the former fort was turned into a palisaded bailey. The village of Church Brough was created alongside the castle at around the same time, in the form of a planned settlement, part of the Norman colonisation of the low-lands in the region.|$|E
5|$|For {{a case to}} be investigated, {{a person}} needs to {{petition}} the CCDI.

Petitions may also be filed on the CCDI website, and the commission receives cases through the Office for Circuit Inspection Work (which sends inspection teams throughout <b>the</b> <b>country).</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> case handled by former ODIS Third Division director and Case Hearing Office director Li Huiran, a petition was sent to all department heads in the ministry employing the petitioner, several offices of the CCDI and PSC members Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji and Wei Jianxing.|$|E
5|$|Lex Luger's {{rivalry with}} Yokozuna began on July 4 at the Yokozuna Bodyslam Challenge {{on the deck}} of the USS Intrepid. After several wrestlers and other athletes {{attempted}} to body slam Yokozuna, Luger arrived in a helicopter. He was able to body slam Yokozuna, which led to a title shot at SummerSlam. To build support for Luger, the WWF had him ride across <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bus named the Lex Express. Yokozuna's spokesperson, Jim Cornette, agreed to the match, but he made Lex Luger agree to two conditions. Luger would not receive a rematch if he lost, and he had to wear protective padding over the steel plate in his forearm.|$|E

5|$|On October2, the {{government}} of Belize {{declared a state of}} emergency and activated the entire Belize Defence Force due to the storm's threat. The airport in Belize City was closed during Keith's passage, limiting transportation from the country's mainland to its offshore islands. In Corozal, Belize, authorities evacuated the entire city of 10,000people to numerous shelters in Orange Walk. Officials were also ordered evacuations for Belize City, setting up shelters in Belmopan. Overall, about 25,000people evacuate, or about 10% of Belize's population. Three hospitals were evacuated in <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> post-storm assessment, residents on the offshore islands acknowledged they were unprepared for the storm and did not anticipate such intensity.|$|E
5|$|The four bulleted lists below {{summarise}} {{the known}} participants to 1725 under each heading. The earliest important match that is designated inter-county was in 1709 {{and the traditional}} county soon became the key unit of organisation. Until 1725, only nine counties (plus London which has on occasion been equated in status with the counties of Middlesex and Surrey for cricketing purposes) had been mentioned in surviving records in connection with cricket and the earliest mention of each is summarised below. Note that all are in the south-eastern quarter of <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> similar vein, although not always in association {{with one of the}} above matches, those players, venues, clubs and teams known to have been active or in use by 1725 are also listed.|$|E
5|$|The {{story was}} {{inspired}} by the ten-year-long Maoist insurgency in Nepal. The game follows Ajay Ghale, a young Kyrati-American who returns to his native country of Kyrat (a fictional Himalayan country derived from Kirati, a collection of Himalayan people originating from Tibet) to spread his deceased mother's ashes. Kyrat was once an autonomous state in the Himalayas ruled by a royal family before being engulfed in a series of civil wars. Ajay finds <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of conflict between Kyrat's Royal Army, led by the country's eccentric and tyrannical King Pagan Min, and the Golden Path, a rebel movement fighting to free Kyrat from Min's oppressive rule. The choices Ajay makes will determine the fate of Kyrat.|$|E

5|$|The war was {{not going}} well for the loyalists and the new regency {{government}} considered retreating to Ireland. Prince Louis and the rebel barons were also finding it difficult to make further progress. Despite Louis controlling Westminster Abbey, {{he could not be}} crowned king because the English Church and the Papacy backed Henry. John's death had defused some of the rebel concerns, and the royal castles were still holding out in the occupied parts of <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> bid to take advantage of this, Henry encouraged the rebel barons to come back to his cause in exchange for the return of their lands, and reissued a version of the Magna Carta, albeit having first removed some of the clauses, including those unfavourable to the Papacy. The move was not successful and opposition to Henry's new government hardened.|$|E
5|$|Before he died, Bolesław III Wrymouth divided <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> limited sense, {{among four}} of his sons. He made complex {{arrangements}} intended to prevent fratricidal warfare and preserve the Polish state's formal unity, but after Bolesław's death, {{the implementation of the}} plan failed and a long period of fragmentation was ushered in. For nearly two centuries, the Piasts would spar with each other, the clergy, and the nobility for the control over the divided kingdom. The stability of the system was supposedly assured by the institution of the senior or high duke of Poland, based in Kraków and assigned to the special Seniorate Province that was not to be subdivided. Following his concept of seniorate, Bolesław divided the country into five principalities: Silesia, Greater Poland, Masovia, Sandomierz and Kraków. The first four provinces were given to his four sons, who became independent rulers. The fifth province, the Seniorate Province of Kraków, was {{to be added to the}} senior among the princes who, as the Grand Duke of Kraków, was the representative of the whole of Poland. This principle broke down already within the generation of Bolesław III's sons, when Władysław II the Exile, Bolesław IV the Curly, Mieszko III the Old and Casimir II the Just fought for power and territory in Poland, and in particular over the throne of Kraków.|$|E
25|$|The country's {{economic}} situation deteriorated rapidly, with attempts at stabilizing the currency being financed by aid packages from the International Monetary Fund.
