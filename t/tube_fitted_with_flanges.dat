Based on the {{advantages}} of polymer materials over other materials, rotors which are made of the polymer material, are the functional elements of the rotor-assembled strand, and rotate under certain mass flow rate to obtain heat transfer enhancement and online automatic cleaning. The paper carried out numerical studies on heat transfer and friction loss characteristics of the <b>tube</b> <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> rotors of different spaces. The comparison of the field synergy angle between plain tube and the <b>tube</b> <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> rotors was also presented in the paper. The numerical data had good agreement with the experimental data. The numerical studies indicated that the field synergy angle of the rotors inserted tube were significantly smaller {{than that of the}} plain tube, which validated that the rotors could significantly enhance heat transfer process and had a better comprehensive performance of heat transfer enhancement though extra friction loss was generated. In addition, both the Nusselt number and friction factor of the <b>tube</b> <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> rotors increased with the increasing space between rotors; the thermal performance factor of the rotors were all higher than 1, which validated the heat transfer enhancement function of the rotors; meanwhile, the thermal performance factor increased with the space between rotors...|$|R

In this project, several parameters such as boundary condition (different Reynolds number), types of fluids (base fluid with different type of nanoparticles), different nanoparticle shapes, different volume fraction and different particle diameter are investigated to identify their effect on the heat transfer and fluid flow through a circular <b>tube</b> <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> helical tape insert geometries. The numerical results indicate that the four types of Nanofluid achieved higher Nusselt number than pure water. Nanofluid with Al 2 O 3 particle achieved the highest Nusselt number.

CFD simulation of fluid flow in a <b>tube</b> <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a hiTRAN insert reveals a complex distribution of surface shear stress. To compare the insert situation with the bare tube, an equivalent velocity concept is introduced {{on the basis that}} at a given average velocity the fluid flow results in the same average wall shear stress regardless of whether the tube is bare or is <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> an insert.

As with most problems in engineering, the interest in the {{heat transfer}} augmentation is increasing due to its extreme importance in various industrial applications. CFD modeling for the heat transfer augmentation in a circular <b>tube</b> <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> and without rod circular inserts in turbulent flow conditions has been explained in this paper using ANSYS Fluent version 14. 0. This paper presents the effect of the circular-ring turbulator (CRT) on the heat transfer and fluid friction characteristics in a heat exchanger tube. The experiments were conducted by insertion of CRTs with various geometries, including three different diameter ratios (DR=d/D= 0. 5, 0. 6 and 0. 7) and two different pitch ratios (PR=p/D= 4, 8). During the CFD simulation air at 27 °C was passed through the test tube which was controlled under uniform wall heat flux condition. The Reynolds number was varied from 4000 to 20, 000. According to the experimental results, heat transfer rates in the <b>tube</b> <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> CRTs are augmented around 57 % to 195 % compared to that in the plain tube, depending upon operating conditions.
