50|$|In {{early and}} middle 20th century {{telephone}} exchanges this task {{was done by}} a supervisory relay set known variously as junctor circuit or district junctor. Later designs made it {{a function of the}} <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> or absorbed it into software.|$|R
50|$|As in {{previous}} designs, supervision of incoming calls is handled by relay sets known as incoming <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits.</b> Unlike {{in previous}} designs, {{this work is}} also done in the <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> for outgoing calls, {{so there are no}} junctor circuits. Since different outgoing trunks are connected to different places and are used for different calls, their relay sets can be specialized for a particular kind of signalling or call metering (see automatic message accounting) or other peculiarity. Thus a TSPS trunk can give complete control to an operator, while an E and M signaling trunk can do the kind of signaling required of a private long-distance line, while a local outgoing trunk can be simpler.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{magnetostrictive}} phased array sensor (MPAS) with a polycrystalline nickel patch of a circular comb shape {{in order for the}} use of the ultrasonic guided Lamb wave inspection technique. The MPAS was comprised of two main components of the surface-mounted nickel patch and a mobile magnetic <b>circuit</b> <b>device</b> enclosing six sensing coils and center-positioned cylindrical biasing magnets. The magnetic <b>circuit</b> <b>device</b> detects the magnetic property change induced by the elastic wave propagation through the magnetostrictive nickel patch bonded to a thin aluminum plate. The individual sensing coils were configured to have directional preferences specified along the perpendicular direction of the coil winding, and they were arranged in a hexagon with a radius of 0. 5 ” to form a compact-sized phased array sensor. Although the magnetic <b>circuit</b> <b>device</b> contains only six physical sensing coils, the MPAS enables to increase the total numbers of sensing positions by altering the orientation of the magnetic <b>circuit</b> <b>device.</b> The enhanced directional sensing capability of the presented MPAS was achieved as a result of the combined effect on the high magnetic shape anisotropy feature along the individual comb finger directions of the nickel patch and the directional sensitivity of the hexagon magnetic <b>circuit</b> <b>device</b> itself...|$|R
25|$|Examples {{of signals}} {{communicating}} supervision or call progress include E and M signaling, SF signaling, and robbed-bit signaling. In physical (not carrier) E and M <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits,</b> <b>trunks</b> were four wire. Fifty trunks {{would require a}} hundred pair cable between switches, for example. Conductors in one common circuit configuration were named tip, ring, ear (E) and mouth (M). Tip and ring were the voice-carrying pair, and named after the tip and ring on the three conductor cords on the manual operator's console.|$|R
50|$|During this era, most voice {{connections}} used analog <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> {{that were}} designed to conform with the Via Net Loss plan established by Bell Laboratories. The purpose of the VNL plan and five-level long distance switching hierarchy was to minimize the number of <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> in a call and maximize the voice quality of the connections. Excessive loss in a voice connection meant that subscribers may have difficulty hearing each other. This was particularly important in the 1960s when dial up data connections were developed {{with the use of}} analog modems. The SES evaluated multi-frequency outpulsing signaling as well as voice impairments including sound amplitude, noise, echo, {{and a variety of other}} parameters. Deployment of common-channel signaling systems such as Common Channel Interoffice Signaling and later Signaling System #7 obviated the need to monitor multi-frequency signaling as it became obsolete.|$|R
50|$|The final {{successor}} to the ChipSite unit was the PinSite. This featured a universal programming base which could accept a variety of socket adapters, including those for chips packaged in PGA, QFP, TSOP, and many others. There was even a special connection module made available which could, through the Pinsite's base, allow the Unisite {{to serve as the}} programming source in automated <b>device</b> <b>handlers</b> in factory floor environments.|$|R
25|$|Some {{signalling}} communicated dialed digits. An early form called Panel Call Indicator Pulsing used quaternary pulses {{to set up}} calls {{between a}} panel switch and a manual switchboard. Probably {{the most common form}} of communicating dialed digits between electromechanical switches was sending dial pulses, equivalent to a rotary dial's pulsing, but sent over <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> between switches.|$|R

Four Central European countries joined the network. Research networks upgraded their access capacity to 2 Mbit/s, <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> on the busiest routes were upgraded to 8 Mbit/s, and 4 Mbit/s access ports were made available and became operational.|$|R

50|$|Later {{versions}} of RT-11 allowed specification {{of up to}} 64 units (0-77 octal) for certain devices, but the device name was still limited to three alphanumeric characters. This feature was enabled through a SYSGEN selection, and only applied to the DU and LD <b>device</b> <b>handlers.</b> In these two cases, the device name form became 'dnn:' where 'd' was 'D' for the DU device and 'L' for the LD device, and 'nn' was 00-77(octal).|$|R

50|$|Also taking {{advantage}} of the superior versatility of 5XB, Centrex was invented as a service package. Later stored program control exchanges allowed more extensive service features. Autovon originally used a four-wire version of 5XB, with a more complex marker to implement its nonhierarchical polygrid routing system, and <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> with additional logic and data storage built in to implement preemption.|$|R
50|$|Thanks to {{this more}} complex <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit,</b> {{outgoing}} <b>trunks</b> are selected by a quicker and more versatile method than the sleeve test previously used. Each <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> provides a ground on an FT lead to indicate idleness. The FT leads for trunks {{in a particular}} group are cross-connected to a FTC (frame test common) lead for its trunk link frame, {{to indicate that the}} TLF has one or more idle trunks in that group. The route relay in the completing marker connects sensor relays to all the trunk link frames, allowing the marker to choose a TLF that has an idle trunk and then connect to that trunk through the trunk link connector (TLC) to choose one of those idle trunks. This two step method, along with the mixing of incoming and outgoing traffic, distributed traffic more evenly, thus alleviating the link congestion problems that often arose with earlier methods that restricted a trunk group to one or two outgoing switch frames.|$|R
