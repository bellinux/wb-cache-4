40|$|Qf Alluvial fan {{and recent}} {{alluvium}} Undivided fans that typically form {{at the base}} of steep slopes, issuing from drainage catchments or on the floor of wider drainage channels.

Distal portions of many fans are generally inactive, composed of abandoned lobes, and generally have well developed soils. Larger fans generally contain some active alluvium, which were not mapped in detail. The active alluvium consists of migrating ephemeral stream channels composed of unconsolidated sands and subrounded gravels including locally derived pebbles <b>to</b> <b>boulders</b> of Pyramid sequence volcanic rocks...|$|R

Besides work with Walsh in his band The James Gang and as a solo artist, he also brought Walsh in to work on several albums he was doing with other musicians, using him as a session player for the B.
