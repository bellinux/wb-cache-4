5000|$|A pull is a ball whose {{flight path}} is straight, with {{negligible}} sidespin {{that ends up}} left of the target. The incidence angle of <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> is x° {{to the left of}} the target, and where the path of <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> is also x° {{to the left of the}} target (outside to inside path).|$|E
50|$|Sidespin {{occurs when}} <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> is not aligned perpendicularly to the {{intended}} direction of swing or ball-to-target line, {{leading to a}} lift force that makes the ball curve to {{one side or the}} other based on the direction of where <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> is pointing at impact. The dimples allow both the sidespin to occur as well as to promote an angular upward lift. Some dimple designs are claimed to reduce the sidespin effects to provide a straighter ball flight.|$|E
5000|$|Mabel Stringer {{wrote of}} her short game, [...] "Dorothy's best stroke was a run-up shot {{that she used}} from {{distances}} of up to 50 feet. She used her goose-necked mashie, which she nicknamed [...] "Thomas", closing <b>the</b> small <b>clubface</b> and hitting <b>the</b> ball on the downswing. At Augusta Country Club in 1926, she holed two chip shots and ended up having a record low of 19 putts for 18 holes, lowering Walter Travis's record by two strokes for putts in one round.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Sports Engineering [© Wiley-Blackwell] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] perception of ‘feel’ during a ball-implement impact is considered a significant determinant in equipment selection. Previous studies in golf have found that the perceived time for which <b>the</b> ball and <b>clubface</b> are in contact is a factor in the ‘feel’ of the shot. This factor appears to have become more significant with the development of the latest metal ‘woods’. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether golfers’ perceptions of impact duration correspond to measured values or whether the perceptions are created by other factors. A technique has been developed to measure the duration of impact by creating an electrical circuit in which <b>the</b> ball and <b>clubface</b> form a ‘switch’, completing the circuit whilst contact is maintained between the two bodies. Measurements were taken of the duration of impact between five different types of clubhead and two different constructions of golf ball. Further tests, also reported in this paper, investigated the effect of both clubhead speed at impact and ball compression on the impact duration. The results suggest that the ball has a greater effect on impact duration than the type of clubhead with lower compression balls producing longer impact durations than higher compression balls and two piece balls producing shorter impact durations than three piece, wound balls. It was also found that the duration of impact decreased as the clubhead speed at impact was increased. Finally, results suggest that there is no correlation between the perception of the golfer and the actual duration of impact and therefore other factors are responsible for creating this perception...|$|R
5000|$|For many players, long irons (numbers 1-4) are {{difficult}} to hit well even with modern <b>clubfaces,</b> due to <b>the</b> low trajectory and very small face of the low-loft clubhead. Players tend to avoid these clubs in favor of fairway woods which have a larger [...] "sweet spot" [...] to hit with, but such woods, having longer shafts, have a different swing mechanic that is sometimes difficult to master. The long shaft of a fairway wood also requires lots of room to swing, making it unsuitable for tighter lies such as [...] "punching" [...] out from underneath trees. In addition, <b>the</b> fairway wood <b>clubface</b> is designed to skim over instead of cutting into turf, which makes it undesirable for shots from the rough. The answer to this dilemma for many players is to replace the 1-4 irons with hybrids.|$|R
5000|$|A pop-up (or sky) {{occurs when}} the ball strikes too highly on <b>the</b> <b>clubface,</b> causing the shot to travel very high, leaving it well short of its {{intended}} target.|$|E
50|$|Backspin is {{imparted}} {{in almost}} every shot due to the golf club's loft (i.e., angle between <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> and a vertical plane). A backspinning ball experiences an upward lift force which makes it fly higher and longer than a ball without spin.|$|E
5000|$|The {{golf swing}} is {{outwardly}} similar {{to many other}} motions involving swinging a tool or playing implement, such as an axe or a baseball bat; however, unlike many of these motions, {{the result of the}} swing is highly dependent on several sub-motions being properly aligned and timed, to ensure that the club travels up to the ball in line with the desired path, <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> is in line with the swing path, and the ball impacts the centre or [...] "sweet spot" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>clubface.</b> The ability to do this consistently, across a complete set of clubs {{with a wide range of}} shaft lengths and clubface areas, is a key skill for any golfer, and takes a significant effort to achieve.|$|E
2500|$|Golfers {{start with}} the non-dominant {{side of the body}} facing the target (for a right-hander, the target is to their left). At address, the player's body and the {{centerline}} of the club face are positioned parallel to the desired line of travel, with the feet either perpendicular to that line or slightly splayed outward. The feet are commonly shoulder-width apart for middle irons and putters, narrower for short irons and wider for long irons and woods. The ball is typically positioned more to the [...] "front" [...] of the player's stance (closer to the leading foot) for lower-lofted clubs, with the usual ball position for a drive being just behind the arch of the leading foot. The ball is placed further [...] "back" [...] in the player's stance (toward the trailing foot) as the loft of the club to be used increases. Most iron shots and putts are made with the ball roughly centered in the stance, while a few mid- and short-iron shots are made with the ball slightly behind the centre of the stance to ensure consistent contact between <b>the</b> ball and <b>clubface,</b> so <b>the</b> ball is on its way before the club continues down into the turf.|$|R
5000|$|A slice {{occurs when}} <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> is open {{relative}} to the swingpath or with an outside-in swingpath and thus flies severely {{from left to right}} for a right-handed player, or vice versa for a left-handed player. Skilled players can slice the ball at will, but most commonly it is a misplayed shot that often has negative consequences.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{consideration}} is [...] "spin", affected by compression {{and by the}} cover material; a [...] "high-spin" [...] ball allows more of the ball's surface to contact <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> at impact, allowing the grooves of <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> to [...] "grip" [...] the ball and induce more backspin at launch. Backspin creates lift that can increase carry distance, and also provides [...] "bite" [...] which allows a ball to arrest its forward motion at the initial point of impact, bouncing straight up or even backwards, allowing for precision placement of {{the ball on the}} green with an approach shot. However, high-spin cover materials, typically being softer, are less durable which shortens the useful life of the ball, and backspin is not desirable on most long-distance shots, such as with the driver, as it causes the shot to [...] "balloon" [...] and then to bite on the fairway, when additional rolling distance is usually desired.|$|E
5000|$|In Harvey Penick's Little Red Book, {{the word}} [...] "bounce" [...] is used only once. Penick {{mentioned}} it {{in relationship to}} an important wedge shot for tight lies. In addition to putting more weight on the front foot and striking the ball and ground at the same time, Penick said the golfer would play the ball off the back foot and square <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> to the target so that [...] "the bounce of the blade does not touch the ground." ...|$|E
5000|$|Newer {{designs of}} wedges, {{especially}} the sand wedge, {{have changed the}} shape of the sole slightly to reduce the bounce along the heel (hosel side) and provide a more curved leading edge. This newer shape allows for the golfer to [...] "open" [...] <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> for short, high-backspin chip shots that [...] "stick" [...] on the green or even roll backwards, without the wide heel lifting the bottom edge of the club at address or the additional angle providing too much bounce.|$|E
5000|$|Players with {{problems}} slicing their drive shots (for a right-hander, a slice starts straight and curves to the right) {{may benefit from}} an additional closed offset of 3-4°, which will help square <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> to the ball during the swing. This is typically {{referred to as a}} [...] "max game improvement" [...] driver, sometimes as a [...] "draw driver" [...] because a player with a correct swing using such a driver will draw their shots (for a right-hander, a [...] "draw" [...] starts straight but curves left).|$|E
5000|$|Lamb is {{reputed to}} be the {{inventor}} of the [...] "bulger" [...] golf club, a wood with a convex face, circa 1885. In his 1890 book Golf, Horace Hutchinson advises that the theory behind the convex face is that shots hit on the heel will have less of a tendency to go to the right and shots struck nearer the toe will have a lesser tendency of traveling to the left of your target. Meanwhile, a shot struck in the sweet spot (center of <b>the</b> <b>clubface)</b> will be unaffected. All woods and metal woods of the modern era incorporate Lamb's invention.|$|E
5000|$|A hybrid {{generally}} {{features a}} head {{very similar to}} a fairway wood; hollow steel or titanium with a shallow, slightly convex face. A hybrid head is usually marginally shallower and does not extend backwards from the face {{as far as a}} comparable fairway wood. The head must have an iron-like lie angle, and therefore also has a flatter sole than a fairway wood. The face incorporates the [...] "trampoline" [...] effect common to most modern woods, in which <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> deforms slightly, then returns to its previous shape, increasing the impulse applied to the ball at launch. The hybrid's lie, length and weight is comparable to an iron.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design of}} the putter's club head has {{undergone}} radical change in the last 20-30 years, as have many club types. The putter was originally a forged iron piece very similar in shape to the irons of the day. Through attempts to lower {{the center of gravity}} of the club head, it evolved into a shorter, thicker head slightly curved from front to rear (the so-called [...] "hot dog" [...] putter). The introduction of investment casting for club heads allowed drastically different shapes to be made far more easily and cheaply than with forging, resulting in several design improvements. First of all, the majority of mass behind <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> was placed as low as possible, resulting in an L-shaped side profile with a thin, flat club face and another thin block along the bottom of the club behind the face. Additionally, peripheral weighting, or the placing of mass as far away from the center of <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> as possible, increases the moment of inertia of the club head, reducing twisting if the club contacts the ball slightly off-center and thus giving the club a larger [...] "sweet spot" [...] with which to contact the ball. Newer innovations include replacing the metal at the [...] "sweet spot" [...] with a softer metal or polymer compound that will give and rebound at impact, which increases the peak impulse (force x time) imparted to the ball for better distance. Putters are subdivided into mallet, peripheral weighted and blade styles. Power instability and practice/play convertibility are features embodied in the latest putter design technology.|$|E
5000|$|Irons are {{the most}} common type of club; a {{standard}} set of 14 golf clubs will usually contain between 7 and 11 irons, including wedges. Irons are customarily differentiated by a number from 1 to 10 (most commonly 3 to 9) that indicates the relative angle of loft on <b>the</b> <b>clubface,</b> although a set of irons will also vary in clubhead size, shaft length, and hence lie angle as the loft (and number) increase. Irons with higher loft than the numbered irons are called wedges, which are typically marked with a letter indicating their name, and are used for a variety of [...] "utility" [...] shots requiring short distance and/or a high launch angle.|$|E
5000|$|With {{such high}} {{emphasis}} on drive distance and accuracy by players wanting to [...] "play like the pros", {{a large amount}} of customization is available in drivers in order to provide the club configuration that best matches the player's specific swing mechanics. Club-makers generally provide for selection and/or customization of five things: the shaft flex, which determines how energy is stored and released during the player's swing; the loft angle, which is a determinant of launch angle and backspin; the offset, which determines the angle <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> will have to the ball at impact; the clubhead mass, which can [...] "fine-tune" [...] the clubhead behaviour for a player's swing tempo; and the centre of mass, which is also a factor in launch angle and backspin.|$|E
5000|$|The {{relation}} between actual loft and bounce can change {{based on how}} the player addresses the ball; the more forward the ball, and the more open <b>the</b> <b>clubface,</b> the higher the effective loft and bounce angles. Some clubmakers will vary the amount of bounce that the sole has from toe to heel, allowing the player to fine-tune the club to the specific situation by opening it. When square at address, such a club behaves more like a lower-bounce pitching wedge, while when opened, the club behaves more like a sand wedge (without the bounce becoming too high and making a [...] "skulled" [...] shot more likely, as it would with a constant bounce angle from tow to heel). A few manufacturers call attention to this by labeling the wedge [...] "D" [...] for [...] "dual wedge", indicating {{it can be used}} as either a pitching or sand wedge (or anything in between).|$|E
5000|$|A {{player with}} a stronger-than-average swing (>100 mph at impact) will {{typically}} want a stiff-flex shaft {{and a lower}} loft, around 9.5°, which will respond better to the faster swing tempo and will launch the ball lower so the energy is spent sending the ball outward instead of keeping it in the air. The same player might also benefit from a [...] "Tour driver", which has a 1-2° offset to [...] "open" [...] <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> (angle {{it away from the}} player), and a higher, further-rearward centre of mass. These changes can correct certain problems with a strong swing, such as torquing in the clubhead [...] "closing" [...] it at impact causing draws, and the normally low and forward centre of gravity causing excessive backspin which can make drives [...] "balloon"; the shot will start low but curve upwards in flight, then [...] "stall" [...] and drop onto the turf, reducing total distance. Most stiff driver shafts are marked usually X-Stiff or even more. These are commonly professional-level stiffnesses due the rarity of amateur players capable of hitting swing speeds over 110 mph, although these also occur sometimes.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of golf driver mass and shaft length on initial golf ball launch conditions was investigated. A series of carefully selected player tests {{were used to}} isolate the coupled {{influence of}} club mass and shaft length on initial ball velocity, spin rates, launch angle, and dispersion of impacts across <b>the</b> <b>clubface.</b> The ranges of selected club masses and shaft lengths were typical of those found in currently available drivers. While longer, lighter clubs generally led to higher ball speeds for most test golfers, those combinations of club mass and club length that minimized spin rates resulted in the greatest estimated total shot distance. Not surprisingly, use of longer drivers led to a slightly larger dispersion of impacts over <b>the</b> <b>clubface.</b> Interestingly, individual golfers tended to miss in the same region of <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> irrespective of the club length, i. e., they compensated for changes in club mass and length when swinging. Employing the methodology outlined here, {{it may be possible}} to tailor golf club designs in order to obtain enhanced golf ball launch characteristics for a range of golfers. Such efforts may facilitate golf club design by establishing relationships between mass and configuration parameters that lead to improved driver performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to develop a}} {{reusable}} practice device that could help golfers analyze their shots. A Magic Pad, consisting of a translucent, plastic top layer and a statically charged thin layer of cardboard, was modified and placed on <b>the</b> <b>clubface.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> strikes the ball, the top plastic layer attaches itself to the bottom layer creating a noticeable impression. By peeling the top layer, the device could be reset and used again several times. A series of tests was conducted to prove the viability of this device. The device was effective in analyzing several aspects of a golf shot. The marks made on the device from impact with the ball were clear and dark. This device is most effective in determining the placement of the ball on <b>the</b> <b>clubface,</b> but it is also successful in identifying inaccurate shots. Slices occur when the club head does not hit the ball squarely, and this is translated unto the device. A few characteristic marks signal a slice. The most obvious is a mark with amorphous shape, favoring one side of the ball, instead of a circular indentation. Shear streaks, straight diagonal lines at the angle of impact, are also apparent and allow the golfer to adjust their swing to compensate. (cont.) The third aspect of the shot that the device could have measured was the power. A bigger indentation did not necessarily produce the greatest yardage, however. The most impressive indentations were produced by a combination of accuracy and power. In this way, the golfer can clearly identify a quality shot. This fact, coupled with the inexpensive materials, makes the device a viable product. by Severiano R. Canales. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Journal of Sports Sciences [© Taylor & Francis Ltd. ] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] influence of impact sound in putting on players' perceptions of “feel” is explored in this paper. Tests were conducted to investigate the impact sound characteristics of five different ball types using two different putter types. The first test studied the impact sound of purely the ball, while the second test investigated the influence of putter construction and impact location on impact sound for the different ball types. Trends were found between sound spectra peaks in the 2 – 4 kHz range and the compression values of the balls. In addition, frequency content was more dependent on putter type and impact location than on ball construction in the 0 – 2 kHz range. The final test employed a paired comparison technique to investigate players' perceptions of sharpness and loudness of impact sound, ball speed from <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> and ball hardness. Relationships between the subjective data and the sound characteristics of the balls were then examined. It was found that the ball the players' perceived to have the sharpest and loudest sound, to feel the hardest and to come off <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> the quickest also had the largest calculated values of loudness and sharpness and had a spectral peak at a higher frequency than the other balls...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{determine}} how shaft stiffness affects clubhead speed and how it alters clubhead orientation at impact. For the first time, a 3 D, six-segment forward dynamics model of a golfer and club was developed and optimized to answer these questions. A range of shaft stiffness levels from flexible to stiff were evaluated at three levels of swing speed (38, 45 and 53 m/s). At any level of swing speed, the difference in clubhead speed did not exceed 0. 1 m/s across levels of shaft stiffness. Therefore, {{it was concluded that}} customizing the stiffness of a golf club shaft to perfectly suit a particular swing will not increase clubhead speed sufficiently to have any meaningful effect on performance. The magnitude of lead deflection at impact increased as shaft stiffness decreased. The magnitude of lead deflection at impact also increased as swing speed increased. For an optimized swing that generated a clubhead speed of 45 m/s, with a shaft of regular stiffness, lead deflection of the shaft at impact was 6. 25 cm. The same simulation resulted in a toe-down shaft deflection of 2. 27 cm at impact. Using the model, it was estimated that for each centimeter of lead deflection of the shaft, dynamic loft increased by approximately 0. 8 degrees. Toe-down shaft deflection had relatively no influence on dynamic loft. For every centimeter increase in lead deflection of the shaft, dynamic closing of <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> increased by approximately 0. 7 degrees. For every centimeter increase in toe-down shaft deflection, dynamic closing of <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> decreased by approximately 0. 5 degrees. The results from this thesis indicate that improvements in driving distance brought about by altering shaft stiffness are the result of altered clubhead orientation at impact and not increased clubhead speed...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the swing}} plane {{has been a}} popular area of golf {{biomechanics}} research, {{the movement of the}} club relative to the swing plane has yet to be shown experimentally to have a relationship with performance. This study used principal component and subsequent multiple regression analysis to investigate the relationship between the movement of the club relative to the delivery plane and clubhead characteristics at ball impact. The principal components reflected deviations from an individual swing plane, and lower values of these components were associated with less variability in <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> impact location. In the event that a golf coach wants to improve the precision of ball striking, the results from this study suggest that both simplicity of the route and alignment of the club to the final trajectory before impact could be advantageous. However, this does not suggest that the technique should be based on a ‘model’ swing plane...|$|E
40|$|Swing {{planes in}} golf {{have become a}} popular area of research. Cochran and Stobbs (1968) {{examined}} {{the motion of the}} clubhead and hands qualitatively. Subsequent quantitative analyses have included investigations of the planarity of the whole club (Coleman & Anderson, 2007) and clubhead (Shin, Casebolt, Lambert, Kim, & Kwon, 2008). The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the motion of the clubhead and hands in the downswing quantitatively, and to compare these motions for the fade and draw (as suggested by Coleman and Anderson, 2007). In conclusion, both the clubhead and hand planes in the late downswing were found to differ significantly in relation to the target line between the draw and fade shots. Greater differences were found between golfers, rather than between shots, in the relationship between the clubhead and hand motion during the downswing. Nevertheless, further detailed analysis is warranted of how the motions around impact – especially <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> orientation – differ between the two types of shot...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the difference in the amount of spin that can be generated during a controlled golf shot, as a result of the 2010 rule change regarding restrictions applied to the design of the grooves on <b>the</b> <b>clubface</b> implemented by the United States Golf Association and the Royal & Ancient Golf Club. Ten experienced golfers (mean ± SD; age, 23. 0 ± 0. 67 yr; playing experience, 13. 2 ± 1. 6 yr; handicap, 1. 6 ± 1. 4) were required to play a total of 120 shots inside a state of the art golf simulator with 3 clubs consisting of ‘old’ pre 2010 U-groove design and ‘new’ post 2010 V-groove design. With the U and V grooved clubs, participants played 10 shots from a fairway mat and 10 shots from a rough mat using a 9 iron, PW and SW. Backspin (RPM) and, as a measure of accuracy, distance landed from the pin (yds) were recorded. Compared to the U-grooves, the newer V-groove design imparted significantly less backspin from both the fairway and rough surfaces (P < 0. 05), additionally, shots with all clubs were consistently further away from the pin (P < 0. 05). The newer groove design does not enable players to impart as much backspin on the ball as they previously could and our data suggest that the recent change in golf club design might therefore reward driving accuracy...|$|E
