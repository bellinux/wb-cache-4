5|$|In 1902, the Pittsburgh Bankers of the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League signed Stuart to a {{professional}} contract; this was disputed between <b>the</b> <b>Bankers</b> and the Pittsburgh Victorias, who also claimed him. Eventually <b>the</b> <b>Bankers</b> won the dispute and kept Stuart; the following year they would also sign Bruce. Stuart was offered a salary of US$15–20 per week, plus steady income from a day job in Pittsburgh. Stuart scored seven goals and had eight assists and was named the best cover-point {{in the league in}} 1903.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>Bankers</b> {{are seen}} as a part of North Carolina's coastal heritage, they have been allowed to remain on the barrier islands.

5|$|At 3 a.m. about 120 {{bank and}} trust company {{officials}} assembled {{to hear a}} full report {{on the status of}} the failing trust companies. While the Trust Company of America was barely solvent, the Lincoln Trust Company was probably $1 million short of what it needed to cover depositor accounts. As discussion ensued, <b>the</b> <b>bankers</b> realized that Morgan had locked them in the library and pocketed the key to force a solution, the sort of strong-arm tactic he had been known to use in the past. Morgan then entered the talks and advised the trust companies they must provide a loan of $25 million to save the weaker institutions. The trust presidents were still reluctant to act, but Morgan informed them that if they did not it would lead to a complete collapse of the banking system. Through his considerable influence, at about 4:45a.m. he persuaded the unofficial leader of the trust companies to sign the agreement, and the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>bankers</b> followed. Having received these commitments, Morgan allowed <b>the</b> <b>bankers</b> to go home.|$|E
50|$|If {{each of the}} player's now-separated hands beat <b>the</b> <b>banker's</b> {{corresponding}} hand then he {{wins the}} bet. If only one of his hands beats <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> then he pushes (ties) in which case neither he nor <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> wins <b>the</b> bet. If both of his hands lose to <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> then he loses.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>banker</b> had his astute doubts of Paolo's intelligence; <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> in Europe doubts all news not {{originating}} in his house; {{but after a}} day or two the advertisements in the newspapers carried conviction even to <b>the</b> <b>banker.</b>|$|R
5000|$|If <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> {{does not}} roll an {{automatic}} win or loss, {{they will have}} rolled a point of 2, 3, 4, or 5. Each player then rolls the dice to settle his individual bet against <b>the</b> <b>banker.</b> <b>The</b> player wins with a 4-5-6, triple, or any point higher than <b>the</b> <b>Banker's.</b> They lose with a 1-2-3, or any point lower than <b>the</b> <b>banker's.</b> If they tie <b>the</b> <b>banker's</b> point, then it's a [...] "push", no winner or loser, and the player pockets his stake. If they don't roll win, loss, or point, they continue to roll the dice until they do so.|$|R
5|$|In 1955, ten {{horses were}} taken from the Ocracoke herd as a project for Mounted Boy Scout Troop 290. After taming and {{branding}} the horses, the scouts trained them for public service activities. <b>The</b> <b>Bankers</b> were ridden in parades and used as mounts during programs to spray mosquito-ridden salt marshes.|$|E
5|$|A herd {{lives on}} the Rachel Carson {{component}} of the North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserve, a series of five small islands and several salt marshes. There were no horses at the Sanctuary until the 1940s. It is unclear whether <b>the</b> <b>Bankers</b> swam over from nearby Shackleford or were left by residents who had used the islands to graze livestock. They are owned and managed {{by the state of}} North Carolina and regarded as a cultural resource.|$|E
5|$|After Armstrong {{retired from}} NASA in 1971, he {{acted as a}} {{spokesman}} for several businesses. The first company to successfully approach him was Chrysler, for whom he appeared in advertising starting in January 1979. Armstrong thought they had a strong engineering division, plus they were in financial difficulty. He later acted as a spokesman for other companies, including General Time Corporation and <b>the</b> <b>Bankers</b> Association of America. He acted as a spokesman for U.S. businesses only.|$|E

50|$|Control of {{the bank}} can change under certain circumstances. If all the players beat <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> in one round, they break the bank, and control {{of the bank}} then passes to the next player to <b>the</b> <b>banker's</b> left, who {{establishes}} his own initial stake as above. Otherwise, the first player to beat <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> by rolling 4-5-6 or triples will become <b>the</b> new <b>banker</b> (after <b>the</b> existing <b>banker</b> settles <b>the</b> remaining bets and pockets whatever remains of his bank).|$|R

5|$|UBS France {{executive}} Patrick de Fayet {{was among}} three local branch executives being investigated. UBS wealth management bankers allegedly {{broke the law}} by enabling French taxpayers to hide their assets in UBS-controlled offshore assets to avoid paying taxes. <b>The</b> <b>bankers</b> undertook to direct their French clients' assets to UBS's Switzerland operation, rather than keep the money in France. UBS set aside approximately US$2 billion in expected liability for its currency rigging and French tax evasion cases.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{worked at}} Mohawk Valley Bank for six years. During {{this time he}} {{developed}} an interest in counterfeit money. He collected counterfeit bills and assembled a scrapbook of these for study. He then had another book of genuine bills; he then compared the two to learn the counterfeiters' techniques. He became an expert in detecting counterfeit bills. This became a valued interest to <b>the</b> <b>bankers</b> and Myers was given all the bank notes to pass through him for approval of genuineness. This ultimately became {{a basis for the}} present day method of detecting counterfeit bills.|$|E
5|$|Other {{articles}} {{dealt with}} punishing specific persons, foremost among these, Piers Gaveston. Article 20 describes at length the offenses committed by Gaveston; {{he was once}} more condemned to exile and was to abjure the realm by 1 November. <b>The</b> <b>bankers</b> of the Italian Frescobaldi company were arrested, and their goods seized. It was held that the king’s great financial dependence on the Italians was politically unfortunate. The last individuals to be singled out for punishment were Henry de Beaumont and his sister, Isabella de Vescy, two foreigners associated with the king’s household. Though {{it is difficult to}} say why these two received particular mention, it could be related to the central position of their possessions in the Scottish war.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Banker's</b> {{voice was}} heard {{properly}} {{for the first}} time on 22 September 2010. In a twist to how boxes are usually chosen, the contestant offered <b>the</b> <b>Banker</b> <b>the</b> opportunity of choosing his next three boxes. <b>The</b> <b>Banker</b> accepted <b>the</b> offer and rather than talking to Edmonds over the phone, his deep, gravelly voice was heard making his choices through the studio speakers.|$|R
50|$|On each hand, ties go to <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> (for example, if a player's five-card hand loses to <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> and his two-card hand ties <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> then <b>the</b> player loses); {{this gives}} <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> a small advantage. If the player fouls his hand, {{meaning that the}} low hand outranks his high hand, or that there are an {{incorrect}} number of cards in each hand, {{there will be a}} penalty: either re-arrangement of the hand according to house rules or forfeiture of the hand.|$|R

5|$|Public Law 105-229, {{commonly}} referred to as the Shackleford Banks Wild Horses Protection Act, states that <b>the</b> <b>Bankers</b> on Shackleford Island are to be jointly managed by the National Park Service and another qualified nonprofit entity (currently the Foundation for Shackleford Horses). The herd is limited to 120–130horses. Population management is achieved through adoption and by administering the contraceptive vaccine Porcine zona pellucida (PZP) to individual mares via dart. The island's horse population is monitored by freeze branding numbers onto each animal's left hindquarter. The identification of individuals allows the National Park Service to ensure correct gender ratios and to select which mares to inject with PZP.|$|E

5|$|In {{his major}} {{theoretical}} statement, 'Opera and Drama' (1852), Wagner {{objected to the}} music of Meyerbeer, asserting its superficiality and incoherence in dramatic terms; this work contains Wagner's well-known put-down of Meyerbeer's operas as 'effects without causes'. It also contains the sardonic crack that ' never could have dreamt that it would some day occur to <b>the</b> <b>Bankers,</b> for whom he had always made their music, to make it for themselves'. 'Jewishness in Music' was reissued in 1869, (after Meyerbeer's death) in an extended form, with a far more explicit attack on Meyerbeer. This version was under Wagner's own name – and as Wagner had by now a far greater reputation, his views obtained far wider publicity. These attacks on Meyerbeer (which also included swipes at Felix Mendelssohn) are regarded by Paul Lawrence Rose as a significant milestone in the growth of German anti-Semitism.|$|E

50|$|As {{the show}} progresses, <b>the</b> <b>Banker's</b> fictitious backstory {{has been built}} up through the character's conversations with Edmonds and the daily contestants. Edmonds {{describes}} <b>the</b> <b>Banker</b> as an older man, who is overweight and has little hair. In various episodes <b>the</b> <b>Banker</b> has been said to speak fluent French and Russian. <b>The</b> <b>Banker</b> has made several references to his six ex-wives, mother, two boxer dogs and also to his estranged son, to whom he never speaks {{on account of his}} being a charity worker.|$|R

Sometimes, during the beginning of the show and in between offers, random images appear in the said third monitor.|$|R
5|$|The {{role of the}} Combined Development Trust was to {{purchase}} or control the mineral resources needed by the Manhattan Project, and to avoid competition between the three. Britain had little need for uranium ores while the war continued, but was anxious to secure adequate supplies for its own nuclear weapons programme when it ended. Half the funding was {{to come from the}} United States and half from Britain and Canada. The initial $12.5 million was transferred to Groves from an account {{in the office of the}} United States Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr., that was not subject to the usual accounting auditing and oversight. By the time Groves resigned from the Trust at the end of 1947, he had deposited $37.5 million into an account he controlled at <b>the</b> <b>Bankers</b> Trust. Payments were then made from this account.|$|E
5|$|By then, Morgan {{was drawn}} into another situation. There was deep {{concern that the}} Trust Company of America and the Lincoln Trust might fail to open on Monday due to {{continuing}} runs by depositors. On Saturday evening 40–50 bankers had gathered at the library to discuss the crisis, with the clearing-house bank presidents in the East room and the trust company executives in the West room. Morgan and those dealing with the Moore & Schley situation {{had moved to the}} librarian’s office. There Morgan told his counselors that he would agree to help shore up Moore & Schley only if the trust companies would work together to bail out their weakest brethren. The discussion among <b>the</b> <b>bankers</b> continued late into Saturday night but without much progress. Around midnight, J.P. Morgan informed a leader of the trust company presidents that keeping Moore & Schley afloat would require $25 million, and he would not commit those funds unless the problems with the trust companies could also be resolved. The trust company executives understood they would not receive further help from Morgan; they would have to finance any bailout of the two struggling trust companies.|$|E
5|$|Edwards' next {{fraudulent}} scheme involved forging {{letters to}} cotton brokers in New Orleans, {{and using the}} signatures obtained from their replies to forge letters to brokers in New York City, saying that the fake John Caldwell– Edwards' alias– had {{a large amount of}} cotton on deposit with the New Orleans brokers. Edwards used those letters to secure fraudulent loans from brokers on the security of the non-existent cotton. Two New York brokers– Brown Bros. & Co. and Jacob Little– gave Edwards bank drafts for $25,000 each. Edwards then cashed the drafts pretending to be Caldwell, but without attempting to disguise his appearance. Unluckily for Edwards, in September 1841 Brown Brothers was informed by the New Orleans brokers that there was no cotton on account for Caldwell, and this prompted <b>the</b> <b>bankers</b> to offer a reward for information on the forger. The police began to search for the forger of the letters, but were unsuccessful until Edwards attempted to distract their attention to an acquaintance, Alexander Powell, who happened to look much like him. Edwards sent an anonymous letter to the New York police, stating that the forger they were hunting was sailing to England, as Powell was about to do. Edwards assumed that by the time the police acted, Powell's ship would already have sailed. The ship was delayed and the police were able to catch Powell, who told them that Edwards was their forger.|$|E
5000|$|Set Point: If <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> rolls a pair and {{a single}} (2, 3, 4, or 5), then the single becomes <b>the</b> <b>banker's</b> [...] "point." [...] E.g. a roll of 2-2-4 gives <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> a point of 4. Note {{that you can not}} set a point of 1 or 6, as those would result in an {{automatic}} loss or win, respectively (see above).|$|R
50|$|In normal times, <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> {{will be able}} to {{immediately}} redeem up to $100 for silver at the rate of 1 oz./$. If <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> expects a heavy demand for silver, they can sell the $500 worth of IOU's for 500 oz. of silver and be ready to redeem all $600 at 1 oz/$. Even if <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> faces a run, where customers suddenly and unexpectedly demand silver for their dollars, <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> could survive <b>the</b> run by selling the $500 worth of IOU's for $500 of his own paper dollars, and burning the paper dollars he receives. Then there would be only $100 of paper left {{in the hands of the}} public, which <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> could redeem with his 100 oz. of silver. At no point would the value of the dollar fall below 1 oz./$, but note that <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> could not survive the run if he did not have adequate assets backing the dollars he has issued.|$|R
50|$|Seating and <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> {{is decided}} through drawing the highest card, or by dice. <b>The</b> <b>banker</b> decides what <b>the</b> stakes {{are for the}} hand (it should be an even number {{so it can be}} split and within the margins agreed by consensus). The player to <b>the</b> <b>banker's</b> left shuffles then passes the deck to <b>the</b> <b>banker's</b> right who becomes the dealer. The dealer cuts and reveals a card. If the card is a 4 or 8, he deals first to himself. If it's a 3 or 7, <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> is dealt first. If it's a 2 or 6, the {{shuffler}} is dealt first. If it's a 1, 5, 9, Zero Cash, Half Cash, Hundred Myriad, Thousand Myriad, or Myriad Myriad, <b>the</b> <b>banker's</b> opposite gets dealt first. Each player is dealt 8 cards counter-clockwise, first as a batch of four cards then singles. The remaining eight cards form the stock which is flipped to reveal the bottom card.|$|R
5|$|Edwards' {{trial was}} in June 1842 {{and was a}} media sensation. He secured a defense team of six lawyers, {{including}} John J. Crittenden, a sitting U. S. Senator, and Thomas F. Marshall, a sitting U. S. Representative. Both Crittenden and Marshall absented themselves from their legislative duties during the trial. One of the junior lawyers was William M. Evarts, who presented the opening remarks for the defense. Another defense lawyer was John Worth Edmonds, who Edwards paid with a forged check. Edwards' handsome appearance worked against him, when one of <b>the</b> <b>bankers</b> who had cashed the drafts identified him in court and remarked that he remembered Edwards because of his striking good looks. Edwards had also neglected to dispose of a marked bank bag {{from one of the}} banks that cashed the fraudulently obtained draft. A final tie-in was the commonality of misspellings between letters from Edwards and the forged letters. The trial ended with Edwards being convicted and given a 10-year prison sentence. The trial's proceedings were published by a New York newspaper, The Herald, and ran to 50,000 copies. None of Edwards' lawyers were ever paid for their services. He was sent to Sing Sing prison, where he attempted to use forged letters to escape. Edwards died in prison on January 27, 1847, of consumption. He was insane {{at the time of his}} death.|$|E

5000|$|During October 1884 in Odessa at cafe [...] "Fanconi" [...] <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> Mr. Dogmarov noticed quite a {{beautiful}} lady who identified herself as Mrs. Sofia San Donato. After some pleasant conversation {{she asked him}} to change a thousand rubles bill. Soon <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> learned that she was leaving for Moscow by evening train, the same as he. <b>The</b> <b>banker</b> suggested that he accompany her. In the sleeping compartment they politely conversed, laughed, and ate chocolate candies. In the morning, after having a good sleep, <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> found neither his money nor securities for the sum of 43,000 rubles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{question}} of whether a bill is [...] "real" [...] or [...] "short-term" [...] would be irrelevant to <b>the</b> <b>banker.</b> <b>The</b> <b>banker</b> is concerned whether the loan will be repaid with interest, and <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> would view <b>the</b> farm as being at least as good collateral as the farmer's future production. <b>The</b> <b>banker</b> might reasonably prefer to lend $300 newly printed dollars to a gambler {{on his way to a}} casino (line (3)), as long as the gambler offers his house as collateral, and as long as the house is worth at least $300. In this case there is hardly any chance that the newly printed $300 will result in any forthcoming productions at all, but that is irrelevant to <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> who has received adequate collateral for his loan.|$|R
50|$|If the player's hand exceeds <b>the</b> <b>banker's</b> {{hand when}} they are compared, each wagering player {{receives}} back their wager and a matching amount from the bank, and <b>the</b> position of <b>banker</b> passes to <b>the</b> next player in order. If <b>the</b> <b>banker's</b> hand exceeds <b>the</b> player's hand, all wagers are forfeit and placed into the bank, and <b>the</b> <b>banker</b> position does not change. If there is a tie, wagers remain as they are for the next hand.|$|R
