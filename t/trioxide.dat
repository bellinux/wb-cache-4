The results of our calculations revealed a number of interesting features when moving along the 3 d-metal series. (1) Geometrical configurations of the lowest total energy states of neutral and charged <b>trioxides</b> and tetraoxides are composed of oxo and/or peroxo groups, except for CuO 3 − and ZnO 3 − which possess a superoxo group, CuO 4 + and ZnO 4 + which possess two superoxo groups, and CuO 3 +, ZnO 3 +, and ZnO 4 −which possess an ozonide group. While peroxo groups {{are found in the}} early and late transition metals, all oxygen atoms bind chemically to the metal atom {{in the middle of the}} series. (2) Attachment or detachment of an electron to/from an oxide often leads to a change in the geometry. In some cases, two dissociatively attached oxygen atoms combine and form a peroxo group or a peroxo group transforms into a superoxo group and vice versa. (3) The adiabatic electron affinity of as many as two <b>trioxides</b> (VO 3 and CoO 3) and four tetraoxides (TiO 4, CrO 4, MnO 4, and FeO 4) are larger than the electron affinity of halogen atoms.

The largest output came from the United Mining Company (Empresa Minera Unificada), which controlled the two largest antimony mines, located at Chilcobija and Caracota, both in Potosí Department. Medium and small miners generated an average of 9,500 tons of antimony a year in the mid-to late-1980s, all of which was exported. Antimony, a strategic mineral used in flameproofing compounds and semiconductors, was exported in concentrates, <b>trioxides,</b> and alloys to all regions of the world, with most sales going to Britain and Brazil. Antimony reserves in 1988 stood at 350,000 tons.|$|R
5|$|Boron trifluoride and trichloride {{are used}} as {{catalysts}} in organic synthesis and electronics; the tribromide {{is used in the}} manufacture of diborane. Non-toxic boron ligands could replace toxic phosphorus ligands in some transition metal catalysts. Silica sulfuric acid (SiO2OSO3H) is used in organic reactions. Germanium dioxide is sometimes used as a catalyst in the production of PET plastic for containers; cheaper antimony compounds, such as the <b>trioxide</b> or triacetate, are more commonly employed for the same purpose despite concerns about antimony contamination of food and drinks. Arsenic <b>trioxide</b> has been used in the production of natural gas, to boost the removal of carbon dioxide, as have selenous acid and tellurous acid.

40|$|Graphene {{has been}} {{identified}} as an emerging horizon for a nanoscale photonic platform because the Fermi level of intrinsic graphene can be engineered to support surface plasmons (SPs). The current solid back electrical gating and chemical doping methods cannot facilitate the demonstration of graphene SPs at the near-infrared (NIR) window because of the limited shift of the Fermi level. Here, we present the evidence for the existence of graphene SPs on a tapered graphene-silicon waveguide tip at a NIR wavelength, employing a surface carrier transfer method with molybdenum <b>trioxides.</b> The coupling between the graphene surface plasmons and the guiding mode in silicon waveguides allows for the observation of the concentrated field of the SPs in the tip by near-field scanning optical microscopy. Thus the hot spot from the concentrated SPs in the graphene layer {{can be used as a}} key experimental signature of graphene SPs.

5|$|Blue dinitrogen <b>trioxide</b> (N2O3) is only {{available}} as a solid because it rapidly dissociates above its melting point to give nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). The latter two compounds are somewhat difficult to study individually because of the equilibrium between them. although sometimes dinitrogen tetroxide can react by heterolytic fission to nitrosonium and nitrate in a medium with high dielectric constant. Nitrogen dioxide is an acrid, corrosive brown gas. Both compounds may be easily prepared by decomposing a dry metal nitrate. Both react with water to form nitric acid. Dinitrogen tetroxide is very useful for the preparation of anhydrous metal nitrates and nitrato complexes, and it became the storable oxidiser of choice for many rockets in both the United States and USSR by the late 1950s. This is {{because it is a}} hypergolic propellant in combination with a hydrazine-based rocket fuel and can be easily stored since it is liquid at room temperature.|$|E
40|$|The {{display of}} shaded polygons by line, cross-hatch, and dot {{patterns}} on vector devices {{is a task}} frequently used in computer graphics and computer cartography. In applications such as the production of shaded maps polygon shading {{turns out to be}} critical with respect to time requirements, and the development of efficient algorithms is of importance. Given an arbitrary polygon in the plane without self-crossing edges (simply-connected polygon), the task at hand is to shade this polygon with one or two sets of parallel lines where for each set a shading angle and a line distance are given. The basic concept of this new algorithm is to decompose the polygon into a set of mutually exclusive trapezoids (in special cases triangles) where the parallel edges of the <b>trioxides</b> are parallel to the desired shading lines. These trapezoids and triangles are then shaded in a fast procedure. In its present form the algorithm handles regions with up to 300 islands. Possible extensions include the construction of dash and cross patterns...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{intercalation}} via spillover {{reaction in}} various tungsten <b>trioxides</b> {{leads to the}} formation of blue hydrogen bronzes. These reversible reactions induce changes in the W - O bond system while maintaining the W - O skeleton. The effect of the intercalation process on the host crystalline structure has been studied with respect to the v(O - W - O) stretching vibration changes and lattice parameter variations by means of infrared and X-ray diffraction measurements. Among the main results, the intercalation process is shown to be strongly influenced by the structural type of the host compound as well as its amorphous versus crystalline nature. For instance, for the ReO 3 type oxides (monoclinic and cubic WO 3) and hexagonal WO 3, v(O - W - O) shifts to higher frequency are assigned to a shortening effect of W - O bonds. A W - O bond system arrangement is also measured for the crystallized and amorphous hydrates WO 3 ·H 2 O, but no detectable changes could be found in the pyrochlore WO 3 and in the hydrate WO 3 · 1 / 3 H 2 O...|$|R
40|$|The amido rhenium <b>trioxides</b> of {{composition}} (iPr 2 N) ReO 3, (iPrCyN) ReO 3 and (Cy 2 N) ReO 3 (Cy = cyclohexyl) were synthesized in a one pot reaction starting from Re 2 O 7, Me 3 SiCl {{and the corresponding}} amines (iPr) 2 NH, (iPr) (Cy) NH, and (Cy) 2 NH, respectively. In the solid state the amido ligands of all three complexes are asymmetrically coordinated to the ReO 3 core allowing for one short Re-H-C contact in each case which might indicate the presence of beta-agostic interaction. However, analysis of the charge density distribution provided us clear-cut criteria that beta-agostic interactions are suppressed by the trans-influence of the oxo-groups. Comparison with structurally related tetra-coordinated d 0 titanium amido complexes highlighted a systematic concept how the extent of beta-agostic interactions in these complexes can be controlled by reducing the trans-influence of the co-ligands. We therefore suggest to employ the expression "hindered agostic interactions" in cases where covalent M-H-C are in principle supported by vacant coordination sites at Lewis-acidic metal centers but are actually hindered for electronic reasons. We further point out that electronic hindrance originating from the transinfluence might be overruled by changing the s/p-donor characteristics of ligands. Comment: 38 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
