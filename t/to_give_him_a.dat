5|$|After some time, Kate speaks at an AA meeting, celebrating {{one year}} of sobriety, while Charlie gets in trouble for riding a bicycle while drunk. Kate visits Charlie and they play croquet. Charlie asks if she would move back in with him if he begins going to AA meetings. Kate says he must get sober for himself, not for her.

5|$|Bart stays up late on Christmas Eve to kill Santa Claus for not {{bringing}} him a dirt bike three Christmases ago. He eventually falls asleep and dreams that the Polar Express, driven by Otto Mann, lands {{in front of}} the house and flies him to the North Pole. Bart meets Santa (Krusty the Clown) only to find out that he has run out of money, since giving out presents in return for cookies every year is not a sustainable business model. Feeling pity, Bart decides that Santa no longer has <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> dirt bike and leaves with Santa throwing a party in his office after revealing how stupid kids are.|$|E
5|$|Benchley {{started at}} the Tribune as a reporter. He was a very poor one, unable to get {{statements}} from people quoted in other papers, and eventually had greater success covering lectures around the city. He was promised a position at the Tribunes Sunday magazine when it launched, and he {{was moved to the}} magazine's staff soon after he was hired, eventually becoming chief writer. He wrote two articles a week: the first a review of non-literary books, the other a feature-style article about whatever he wanted. The liberty gave his work new life, and the success of his pieces in the magazine convinced his editors <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> signed byline column in the Tribune proper.|$|E
5|$|By early 1960, James Kinne was contemplating divorce, {{partially}} {{because of his}} wife's spendthrift habits and {{partially because}} he strongly suspected she was being unfaithful to him. He spoke to his parents {{about the possibility of}} divorce on March 18, 1960, telling them that Sharon had agreed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> divorce if he allowed her to keep the house and the couple's daughter and paid her $1,000, but the elder Kinnes, devout Mormons, urged James to stay in his marriage. Sharon, too, was thinking about ways out of the marriage; according to John Boldizs, she once offered him $1,000 to kill her husband or find someone who would, although he later claimed that she may have been joking.|$|E

5|$|Chesbro {{met with}} Highlanders owner Frank J. Farrell and new manager Harry Wolverton in February 1912 about {{attempting}} a comeback. Wolverton {{agreed to give}} Chesbro a chance at pitching for the Highlanders. However, before leaving for camp he reconsidered and released Chesbro. Chesbro's request for reinstatement {{as a free agent}} was granted in March, while the Highlanders granted him his unconditional release. Chesbro decided to travel to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where teams participated in spring training, in an attempt to find a team willing <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> chance at a comeback. He worked out with Brooklyn and Pittsburgh, but both teams passed on him.|$|E
5|$|Damon hit a {{home run}} to right field in the first at-bat of the game on a 2-1 count to give the Red Sox the lead in the first inning for the fourth {{straight}} game; it proved to be the game-winning run. Ramírez singled in the third inning <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> hit in 17consecutive postseason games. Doubles by David Ortiz to right and Trot Nixon to center, who narrowly missed a grand slam after swinging on a 3-0 count, scored two more runs for the Red Sox to give them a three-run lead.|$|E
5|$|In 1385, Elizabeth {{received}} an official delegation from Grand Duke Jogaila of Lithuania, {{who wished to}} marry Hedwig. In the Act of Kreva, Jogaila promised to pay compensation to William of Austria on Elizabeth's behalf and requested that Elizabeth, as widow of King Louis and heiress of Poland herself as great-grandniece of King Władysław I (whose name Jogaila had purposely assumed on his baptism), legally adopt him as her son in order <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> claim to the Polish crown {{in the event of}} Hedwig's death.

5|$|In flashbacks, Jack is in Phuket, Thailand, {{where he}} meets a local woman named Achara (Bai Ling); the two soon {{enter into a}} relationship. After finding out that she works in a tattoo parlor and claims {{to be able to}} see who people really are, Jack demands that she give him a tattoo.

The next morning, he is beaten up by her brother and other locals and told to leave.|$|E
5|$|Leslie asks April (Aubrey Plaza) {{to check}} on a {{budgeting}} request while they are gone. What should be a simple chore, however, has April waiting on hold at the phone for hours. When she desperately has to use the restroom, Andy agrees to wait by the phone. When she returns, the two start to bond by making up their own lyrics to the hold music, playing a non-water game of Marco Polo around the office, and seeing who can make the best spit-take. When Andy says he is jealous that his ex-girlfriend Ann (Rashida Jones) {{is going to the}} hunting trip with Mark, April offers <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> hickey to make Ann jealous, which Andy accepts.|$|E
5|$|Poe's {{depiction}} of the African servant Jupiter is often considered stereotypical and racist from a modern perspective. Jupiter is depicted as superstitious and so lacking in intelligence that he cannot tell his left from his right. Poe probably included the character after being inspired by a similar character in Sheppard Lee (1836) by Robert Montgomery Bird, which he had reviewed. Black characters in fiction during this time period were not unusual, but Poe's choice <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> speaking role was. Critics and scholars, however, question if Jupiter's accent was authentic or merely comic relief, suggesting it was not similar to accents used by blacks in Charleston but possibly inspired by Gullah.|$|E

5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there was {{something}} wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took me a while to get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E
5|$|The main feud on the Raw brand {{was between}} John Cena and Randy Orton for the WWE Championship. Cena had {{retained}} the title against Orton at SummerSlam. The following night on Raw, Orton demanded a rematch for the title, but his request was declined by General Manager William Regal. Orton proceeded his demands to Mr. McMahon, who also refused <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> rematch unless he proved himself. That night, Orton interfered in Cena's match by assaulting Cena and kicking Cena's father, {{who was at}} ringside, in the head. The following week, Orton was granted a title rematch against Cena at Unforgiven.|$|E
5|$|When {{the council}} {{objects to the}} Duke's {{increasing}} usurpation of power and abrogation of the constitution, Süß suggests to him that this challenge to his authority can be suppressed by dismissing the council and restructuring the government so that the Duke can reign as an absolute monarch. Süß tells the Duke that he can accomplish this by hiring mercenaries and that, {{as a sign of}} their gratitude, the Jews of Württemberg will provide all the requisite funds. Süß argues that he would be most effective if the Duke were <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> letter granting him immunity from the laws of Württemberg. The Duke demurs at first but ultimately grants Süß's request.|$|E

5|$|After {{moving to}} the Montreal area, the LeDucs debuted in the International Wrestling Association with a scripted attack on local wrestler Johnny Rougeau. This led to a feud between the LeDucs and the Rougeaus (Johnny and his real-life brother Jacques). Jos LeDuc was booked to win the Montreal version of the International Heavyweight Championship by {{defeating}} Johnny Rougeau in 1971. The bookers also decided <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> run with the International Tag Team Championship that year, which LeDuc won while teaming with Tony Baillargeon. While in Montreal, the LeDucs also competed for Grand Prix Wrestling and were booked in a feud with the Vachon brothers (Mad Dog and Butcher) as well as Killer Kowalski. The LeDucs had two reigns as the Grand Prix Wrestling Tag Team Championship in 1972 and 1973.|$|E
5|$|After winning 15 {{games again}} in 1927, Aldridge {{expected}} a raise, but instead Pittsburgh owner Barney Dreyfuss traded {{him to the}} New York Giants on February 11, 1928, for Burleigh Grimes, citing Aldridge's 4.25 ERA in 1927 as a reason not <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> raise. He held out {{for much of the}} year; by the time he returned, he was out of shape and pitched poorly. During the time Aldridge refused to report, Giants manager John McGraw threatened Aldridge with less pay, and at one point tried to trade him to the Cincinnati Reds. After the season, in which Aldridge's record was four wins and seven losses with a 4.83 earned run average after 119 innings pitched, he was sent to the Brooklyn Dodgers. However, Aldridge refused to report and retired from baseball instead. His final game was on August 29, 1928.|$|E
5|$|Although the Whig Party was on {{its final}} decline nationally, it {{remained}} strong in Tennessee, and the outlook for Democrats there in 1855 was poor. Feeling that re-election as governor was necessary <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> chance at the higher offices he sought, Johnson agreed to make the run. Meredith P. Gentry received the Whig nomination. A series {{of more than a}} dozen vitriolic debates ensued. The issues in the campaign were slavery, the prohibition of alcohol, and the nativist positions of the Know Nothing Party. Johnson favored the first, but opposed the others. Gentry was more equivocal on the alcohol question, and had gained the support of the Know Nothings, a group Johnson portrayed as a secret society. Johnson was unexpectedly victorious, albeit with a narrower margin than in 1853.|$|E
