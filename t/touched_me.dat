But the one that <b>touched</b> <b>me</b> the most was one that I saw in Deshler, Ohio, {{at the end of a}} long day of whistle-stopping. A little town. I suppose five times the {{population}} was there in the dusk. It was almost impossible to see, but a teenager held up a sign, [...] "Bring Us Together."

[...] He states that the show's seeming weaknesses are part of the reason it succeeds, saying that it [...] "gets off to a choppy start, takes unnecessary musical detours and is staged in a rough-hewn style that sometimes seems more accidental than intentional" [...] but that it [...] "succeeds not despite these flaws but in large measure because of them. Bechdel's ironically self-aware and inwardly searching sensibility is honored by a musical that isn't afraid to reveal its awkward side." ...|$|E

Nevertheless, Lin played more relaxed on the road, where he felt less scrutiny and pressure to perform.|$|E
