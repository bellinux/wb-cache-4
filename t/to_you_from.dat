On April 22, 2012, two Australian newspapers, the Sunday Mail and the Sunday Herald Sun, quoted him as having said, [...] "They did such a faithful arrangement of the instrumentals but the vocals were that pop Glee style". The Mail's quote continued after a comma with [...] "ultra-dry, sounded pretty tuned and the rock has no real sense, like it's playing <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>from</b> a cardboard box." [...] The Herald Sun's continuation of the quote came after a period: [...] "It made it sound dinky and wrong." [...] Gotye said in an interview the next day that he had been referring to [...] "this xylophone hook in my song—it's kind of dinky not just in the cover version but the original song". He added, [...] "I thought it was really clever to transpose the song to two guys ... It was a great idea." [...] In an interview published ten days later, Glee executive music producer Adam Anders said that although the iTunes version of the song that the show released was [...] "very true" [...] to Gotye's, that in the episode itself, [...] "the reality is, it was drier".|$|E

The dissenting elder and the other members of the local court with whom the elder disputed went to the court at the entrance to the Temple Mount, and the elder stated what the elder and the elder's colleagues expounded. If the first court had heard a ruling on the matter, then the court stated it. If not, the litigants and the judges went to the second court, at the entrance of the Temple Court, and the elder once again declared what the elder and the elder's colleagues expounded.
