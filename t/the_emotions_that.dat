Mitsuda had previously released two albums of music from the game, both in 1998, the year the game was released—Xenogears Original Soundtrack, a soundtrack album for the game, and Creid, an album of arranged music inspired by Celtic folk music and Japanese rock. He {{has said that he}} decided to make the album due to <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>that</b> he and fans still felt about the game 13 years after its release, which led him to want to commemorate that. The music of Xenogears is particularly close to Mitsuda, as it was the last soundtrack that he worked on for Square Enix—the first video game company he worked for—and he knew that he would be leaving when he composed the soundtrack for the game. He has said that he had been considering the idea of a Xenogears orchestral album for six or seven years prior to starting on it, but until then did not have both the opportunity to work on the project and the confidence in his own abilities as an orchestrator to make the album sound as he wished.|$|E

[...] The Economist reviewed the book positively, writing [...] "After This is more than a book about an influential time in history and its effect on those living through it.

500|$|The fact is, I used to {{get very}} involved, {{six or seven years}} ago, and before that, in {{questions}} of taxonomy of genre, and in the idea—which is ultimately a political idea—that a given writer, perhaps me, could in some objective way alter or reorganize the boundaries between genres.... Nowadays, I've come to feel that talking about categories, about [...] "high" [...] and [...] "low", about genre and their boundaries and the blurring of those boundaries, all consists only of an elaborate way to avoid actually discussing what moves and interests me about books—my own, and others'. What I like are books in their homely actuality—the insides of the books, the mysterious movements of characters and situations and <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>that</b> accompany those movements.

Kelsey McKinney of New York magazine noted that the show had finally found its groove, writing [...] "For {{the first time since}} its first season, Quantico actually seems to know where it is headed. It’s quite a welcome development, and the newfound confidence ... makes Quantico a much more enjoyable show to watch."

500|$|Disney was {{concerned}} with Lasseter's position {{on the use of}} music. Unlike other Disney films of the time, Lasseter did not want the film to be a musical, saying it was a buddy film featuring [...] "real toys." [...] Joss Whedon agreed, saying, [...] "It would have been a really bad musical, because it's a buddy movie. It's about people who won't admit what they want, much less sing about it. ... Buddy movies are about sublimating, punching an arm, 'I hate you.' It's not about open emotion." [...] However, Disney favored the musical format, claiming [...] "Musicals are our orientation. Characters breaking into song is a great shorthand. It takes some of the onus off what they're asking for." [...] Disney and Pixar reached a compromise: the characters in Toy Story would not break into song, but the film would use non-diegetic songs over the action, as in The Graduate, to convey and amplify <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>that</b> Buzz and Woody were feeling. Disney and Lasseter tapped Randy Newman to compose the film. The edited Toy Story was due to Newman and Gary Rydstrom in late September 1995 for their final work on the score and sound design, respectively.|$|E

[...] "Shyness is one of <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>that</b> may serve as behavioral regulators of social relationships in collectivistic cultures.

Despite this repudiation of writing, Frances kept up her diaries and in them wrote an account of <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>that</b> led up to that dramatic act. She eventually recouped some of the effort that went into the first manuscript by using it as a foundation for her first novel, Evelina, which follows the life of the fictional Caroline Evelyn's daughter.|$|E

Rakoff argued that it is [...] "a defence of melancholy, pessimism, anxiety and all of <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>that</b> have been tarred with the brush of negativity and therefore stricken from the larger cultural conversation.

2500|$|Unreliability of the Narrative- From {{very early}} in the novel, Anna's grandiose voice leads the reader to {{question}} the way she presents her reality. Later, as she recounts her interactions with minor characters by whom she has been duped, it becomes clear that Anna's interpretation of events is not entirely trustworthy. In addition to feeling this distrust, the reader is further alienated and begins to outright dislike Anna when she harshly criticizes Alyona's diary, and even {{goes so far as to}} write [...] in Alyona's voice. However, because Anna is not fully emotionally present, especially with regards to her relationship with her daughter, the reader is forced to supply <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>that</b> Anna cannot bring to her narrative, therefore making the experience of reading the novel all the more powerful.|$|E

Julia related her process as [...] "The songs and the writing happens {{all over the place}} and from all different sources of inspiration. It can be a combination of a place, a person and then <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>that</b> you're going through in relation to those things.

2500|$|Social sharing {{behaviors}} incite a socio-affective dynamic {{between the}} involved persons {{and according to}} several studies, may produce interpersonal benefits, and this can result in further social integration. Humans have long been aware of such processes, and have been using and even exploiting {{them for a long}} time. [...] A particularly prominent example of such purposeful collective social sharing is the celebration or commemoration of collective events (such as war victories and defeats or natural disasters), ceremonies, symbols, symbolic characters or stories, etc. [...] According to Frijda, such collective instances of social sharing are created for similar reasons to those for individual instances; the event has not been fully integrated into the lives of the participants. For collective social sharing, this may mean that the emotions elicited by the event are reactivated in the people who actually experienced the event, or that the emotional event is being reproduced for successive generations who did not actually experience the event because the event represents an important memory of the group. Following this idea, the collective rituals and symbols are linkened to conventional social sharing situations, which both cause a reactivation of <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>that</b> were lived or relived.|$|E
