40|$|Abstract Accounting {{standards}} {{can have}} a significant impact on the liquidity of an entity: both management decisions and the control exercised by supervisory Authorities are influenced by accounting information. Nevertheless the objective of the IASB is to provide users of financial statements with “relevant and useful information […] for their assessment of the amounts, timing and uncertainty of the entity’s future cash flows”, there are some critical points associated with those requirements, in particular for the banking sector. Indeed, it lacks to define the concept of liquidity and to pay attention to the economic maturity of certain items, which is important as well as their amounts. Moreover, given that the information contained in the statement of financial position and the statement of cash flows serves some limitations for the assessment of <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> <b>profile</b> of an entity, it is expected that these gaps are filled by the disclosure. Nevertheless, even IFRS 7 presents some deficiencies that will be underlined in this paper. It is believed that current requirements could be profitably complemented...|$|E
40|$|Where an {{enterprise}} {{is able to}} anticipate its payments {{in such a manner}} as to precisely co-ordinate them with expected receipts, its treasury management is conducted in an optimal manner. In effect {{it will be possible to}} reduce costs to a minimum since the enterprise will neither need to hold near-cash assets in its treasury, with their low returns, nor retain an excessive cash balance in order to meet payments. However, the forecasts are of course, uncertain. By attaching to these treasury forecasts a probability, either relating to their timing or to their amount or both, the managers can estimate the risk of technical insolvency and from this deduce a margin of safety. This safety margin is made up of a combination of near-cash instruments and cash balances. The value of the cash balances and the level of receipts are interdependent. An enterprise that finances all of its working capital, after the deduction of operating costs, via long term capital will have less need of liquidity than one that uses short term borrowings, which are assumed to be intrinsically unstable. The choice of the means of financing working capital and the amount of near-cash assets retained are closely connected. According to classical theory the amount of long term funds used to finance working capital dictates <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> <b>profile</b> of the enterprise, its cash balances reflecting this. In this scenario, however, the greater the amount of long term funds the lower the profitability of the business, all other thing being equal. Similarly, to the extent that receipts are held in the cash balances the solvency of the enterprise is supported but the return on assets is reduced as a consequence. The objective of the manager is thus to define a compromise between liquidity and yield. Therefore, in order to enhance its safety margin {{an enterprise}} can only increase its net receipts or extend the maturity of its borrowings. These two strategies affect the profitability of the enterprise. This traditional rendition conducts the treasury manager to search for an optimal equilibrium that guarantees solvability. Financial equilibrium on the one hand, between inflows and outflows to the cash balances; monetary equilibrium on the other hand, between all the treasury's inflows and outflows, of which net receipts form the foundation. Actually, the issue in management of a treasury can be construed from a different perspective. Contrary to current opinion, an objective of maximising returns is not in conflict with that of maintaining a measure of liquidity. Optimisation consists of improving both the safety margin and the profitability, even within the context of a given treasury strategy. A treasury strategy reconciles the constraints of security and returns whilst minimising the allocation to cash assets. If an enterprise has net receipts that constantly fluctuate mildly around zero, all other things being equal, then the managers: are optimising liquidity movements, are efficiently allocating cash to profitable uses, understand exactly their financing needs, have optimised their banking relations. Without eradicating it completely, the uncertainty relating to receipts and expenditure can and must be considerably reduced and no longer justifies, in any circumstances, the retention of a “mattress” of liquidity. Awareness of the behaviour of cash flows that an enterprise is subject to, that is to say, fluctuations in the bank balances, is in the first instance, a problem of information. Every firm seeks this information. Emergency bank loans – advances and overdrafts – can be used for a relatively small amount and for a brief time to correct the forecasting errors relating to the synchronisation of the flow of funds. The rational use of such assistance requires specific attention to be paid to its adaptation to the need, taking account of the banking terms. The strategy of the treasury could in addition concern itself with the profitability of the various activities of the enterprise, which is the guarantee of long term liquidity. The activity of the enterprise raises the question of its solvability on a daily basis. Optimisation of the treasury function involves not only the coordination of the variations in the bank balances but also a surveillance of the events that generate the flow of funds: investment and its funding, the generation and application of liquidity, control of the fluctuations in the value of cash holdings. Economic literature accords a priority to the profitability criteria in financial strategy. Solvability appears only as a lower order problem that one attempts to resolve separately. Whereas in fact it is the quest to maintain the liquidity of the capital that is the primary objective and this subsumes that of profitability. This only becomes evident rarely, however, when credit is particularly expensive. Thus, all the financial concerns that derive from the operation of an enterprise are connected to importance of liquidity. The imperative of profitability is based upon the cost of holding capital. Every use implies a retention of funds, borrowed or not, for periods of different durations. However, the retention of funds involves costs: explicit costs every time the enterprise has to remunerate the providers of capital as well as opportunity costs corresponding to what the enterprise could have produced via an alternative usage. The operation of the enterprise is only justified if it extracts a sufficient amount from the employment of its resources in order to cover its costs. In other words, profitability is a prerequisite of the liquidity of the enterprise. Profitability and liquidity evolve in the same direction. Neither the retention of significant liquidity nor a collection of positive cash balances are a guarantee of security. Being solvable implies controlling every aspect of the evolution of the financial situation and involves a simultaneous maximisation of profitability and liquidity. Thus the optimal management of the treasury of an enterprise leads us to a consideration of all the financial problems faced by the firm. This comprehensive vision of the financial activity leads to a systematic approach of the treasury that consists of a dynamic response - to maintain the bank balances as close as possible to zero by optimising the funds flow, as well as a structural response – to control the replenishment of liquidity of the enterprise's capital by optimising liquidity flows. Lorsqu'une entreprise est capable de prévoir ses échéances de manière à les faire correspondre exactement à ses prévisions d'encaissements la gestion de la trésorerie est optimale. En effet, les coûts pourront être réduits au minimum puisqu'elle n'aura ni besoin de détenir des actifs liquides de faible rendement en trésorerie, ni de disposer d'un fonds de roulement pléthorique. Toutefois, les prévisions sont dans la réalité, incertaines. En associant aux prévisions de trésorerie une probabilité, soit en date, soit en montant, ou les deux, les responsables peuvent estimer le risque d'insolvabilité technique et en déduire une marge de sécurité. Cette marge de sécurité se compose d'un volant de liquidités et du fonds de roulement. La valeur du fonds de roulement et le niveau de l'encaisse sont interdépendants. Une entreprise qui finance en totalité ses actifs circulants nets des dettes d'exploitation par des capitaux à long terme aura moins besoin de liquidités que si elle les avait financés avec du crédit à court terme, supposé instable par nature. Le choix des moyens de financement des actifs circulants et la part des actifs liquides à maintenir sont étroitement liés. Selon la conception classique le volume des fonds permanents affectés au financement de l'actif circulant conditionne la liquidité de l'entreprise : le fonds de roulement est l'expression de cette liquidité. Or, plus l'immobilisation de fonds est importante et moins l'affaire est rentable, toutes choses égales par ailleurs. De même, plus l'encaisse détenue est forte plus la sécurité de l'entreprise est assurée, mais le rendement des actifs en est affaibli d'autant. L'objectif du responsable financier est donc de définir un équilibre entre liquidité et rentabilité. Ainsi, pour accroître sa marge de sécurité une entreprise ne peut qu'augmenter la proportion de son encaisse, ou allonger la durée de son endettement. Ces deux actions affectent la rentabilité de l'entreprise. Cette conception traditionnelle aboutit au niveau de la gestion de la trésorerie à rechercher un équilibre optimum gage de solvabilité. Equilibre financier, d'une part, entre les emplois et les ressources dont le fonds de roulement est le critère essentiel d'analyse. Equilibre monétaire, d'autre part, entre les flux d'entrée et de sortie de liquidités dont l'encaisse est la garantie. En fait, le problème de la gestion de la trésorerie se pose en d'autres termes. Contrairement à l'opinion courante l'objectif de rentabilité ne s'oppose pas au maintien de la liquidité. L'optimum réside dans l'amélioration conjointe de la sécurité et du profit, contenu même d'une politique de trésorerie. La politique de trésorerie concilie les contraintes de sécurité et de rentabilité en minimisant le volume de l'actif monétaire. Une entreprise dont l'encaisse fluctue en permanence légèrement autour de zéro indique, toutes choses égales par ailleurs, que les responsables : maîtrisent les flux de liquidités, réaffectent efficacement le cash-flow dans des emplois rentables, apprécient au plus juste leurs besoins de financement, négocient au mieux leurs conditions de banque. Sans disparaître totalement l'incertitude relative aux encaissements et aux décaissements peut et doit être sérieusement réduite et ne justifie plus, en tout état de cause, la détention d'un « matelas » de liquidités. La connaissance du comportement des flux monétaires qui transitent par l'entreprise, c'est-à-dire des variations du solde bancaire, est avant tout un problème d'information. La recherche de cette information est à la portée de toutes les firmes. Les crédits bancaires de « dépannage » - escompte et découverts - viennent éventuellement pour une faible part et un temps très court, corriger les erreurs de prévision relatives à la synchronisation des entrées et des sorties de fonds. L'utilisation rationnelle de ces concours nécessite une attention toute particulière de façon à les adapter aux besoins, compte tenu des conditions de banque. La politique de trésorerie doit en outre se préoccuper de la rentabilité des activités, gage de la liquidité à terme. L'activité de l'entreprise remet quotidiennement en question sa solvabilité. La maîtrise de la trésorerie passe non seulement par le contrôle des variations du solde bancaire mais aussi par la surveillance des faits générateurs des flux monétaires : l'investissement et son financement, la formation et l'affectation des flux de liquidités, le contrôle de la variation de la valeur de la monnaie. La littérature économique donne la place essentielle au critère de rentabilité dans la politique financière. La solvabilité n'apparaît que comme un « sous-problème » que l'on tente de résoudre séparément. Or, la recherche et le maintien de la liquidité du patrimoine est en réalité l'objectif prioritaire qui englobe celui de rentabilité. Cette évidence ne devient véritable contrainte que dans les périodes de rareté et de cherté de l'argent. Ainsi, toutes les préoccupations financières qui découlent elles-mêmes du fonctionnement de l'entreprise se rattachent à la nécessaire « liquidité ». L'impératif de rentabilité a pour origine le coût de détention des capitaux. Tout emploi implique une immobilisation de fonds, propres ou empruntés, pour une durée plus ou moins longue. Or toute immobilisation de fonds entraîne des coûts : coûts explicites chaque fois que l'entreprise doit assurer la rémunération des apporteurs de capitaux et coûts d'opportunité correspondants au produit que l'entreprise aurait pu tirer de l'emploi alternatif. L'activité d'entreprise ne se justifie que si elle dégage de ses emplois des ressources suffisantes pour couvrir ses coûts. Autrement dit, la rentabilité est la condition de la liquidité de l'entreprise. Rentabilité et liquidité varient dans le même sens. Ni la détention de liquidités importantes, ni un fonds de roulement positif ne sont une garantie de sécurité. Etre solvable signifie contrôler dans tous ses aspects l'évolution de la situation financière et se traduit par une maximisation simultanée de la rentabilité et de la liquidité. Ainsi la gestion optimale de la trésorerie des entreprises nous conduit à une synthèse de tous les problèmes financiers qui se posent à la firme. Cette vision globale de l'activité financière conduit à une approche système de la trésorerie qui se décline en une action conjoncturelle, dont l'objectif est de maintenir le solde bancaire le plus proche de zéro par la maîtrise des flux d'entrée et de sortie de fonds et une action structurelle, dont l'objectif est de contrôler le potentiel de reconstitution des liquidités du patrimoine de l'entreprise par la maîtrise de la formation et de l'affectation du flux de liquidité...|$|E
40|$|At {{the end of}} 2009, {{countries}} in the Eurozone began to experience a sudden divergence of bond yields as the perceived prospect of sovereign default risk increased. This paper examines the potential spillovers between <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> of <b>the</b> sovereign credit default swap (CDS) market and <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> of <b>the</b> sovereign bond market {{for a group of}} Eurozone countries. Empirically, we consider the differential spread on various Eurozone members sovereign bonds over the equivalent German benchmark.

40|$|Recent {{economic}} turmoil {{has forced}} institutional investment firms to place {{more emphasis on}} liquidity. Firms such as banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, endowments, and pension funds all face {{a unique set of}} liquidity risk factors. There are several methods for measuring liquidity risk available to firms. However, these measures are subject to interpretation errors as well as errors in definition. Institutional investment firms need to understand liquidity risk measures as well as the factors that are involved in determining these measures. Firms can only manage their liquidity risk if they understand the risks that they are subject to and how to measure that risk. Liquidity risk management techniques that are viable for certain firms may not pertain to others. Regulatory requirements as well as firm-specific <b>liquidity</b> <b>profiles</b> are also important factors in determining the appropriate methods of quantifying and managing liquidity risk. This paper analyzes <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk <b>profile</b> of banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, endowments, and pension funds and offers several liquidity measures that can be utilized by firms. I suggest measures that may be more applicable to certain firms. There is also a discussion of the immunization technique for liquidity risk management.

40|$|A strong <b>liquidity</b> <b>profile</b> is {{important}} for all companies.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{large-scale}} study of commonality in liquidity and resilience across assets in an ultra high-frequency (millisecond-timestamped) Limit Order Book (LOB) dataset from a pan-European electronic equity trading facility.

We employ Independent Component Analysis, which both decorrelates <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> measures in <b>the</b> asset cross-section, but also reduces higher-order statistical dependencies. To measure commonality in liquidity resilience, we utilise a novel characterisation as the time required for return to a threshold liquidity level.

40|$|Purpose – The aim is {{to study}} jump {{liquidity}} risk {{and its impact on}} risk measures: value at risk (VaR) and conditional VaR (CVaR). Design/methodology/approach – <b>The</b> <b>liquidity</b> discount factor is modelled with mean revision jump diffusion processes and <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk is integrated in the framework of VaR and CVaR. Findings – The standard VaR, CVaR, and <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> adjusted VaR can seriously underestimate the potential loss over a short holding period for rare jump liquidity events.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic portfolio choice model to analyze <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> premium necessary to compensate an investor for the adverse price impact of trading. By calibrating {{the model to}} empirically reasonable parameter values, we generate a plausible <b>liquidity</b> premium. Specifically, <b>the</b> premium is an increasing, concave function of price impact. It increases with the investor’s initial wealth and decreases with the investor’s risk aversion and investment horizon. The optimal equity proportion depends on the investment horizon and initial wealth — even for an investor with constant relative risk aversion. We also find that it is <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> level, rather than <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> variability, that has the largest effect on <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> premium.

The study relies on an exogenous change in <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> of underlying stocks, namely, the tick size reduction implemented by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEx), which significantly reduces the bid-ask spreads of underlying stocks. The bid-ask spreads of derivative securities are also significantly reduced, especially those less liquid and with a greater inventory risk. The results of the paper are consistent with the derivative hedging theory of Cho and Engle (1999) and shed light on the sources of <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> of derivative securities.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find out how <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> of a stock limit order book evolves around earnings announcements. The study also addressed the question of how traders behave around earnings announcements. Third aim was to shed light on what are the effects of earnings announcements on information asymmetries. Liquidity has been recognized as an important factor in the stock markets. However, the shift from dealer markets to limit order markets has changed <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> supply: in dealer markets <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> is supplied by a market maker and traders only take liquidity, whereas in limit order markets the traders themselves may choose whether to supply or take liquidity. Hence, by studying <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> in a limit order market it may be possible to provide information on behaviour of traders and information asymmetries between the traders affecting their trading behaviour. This study used high frequency limit order book data of 75 liquid stocks traded in exchanges belonging to NASDAQ OMX Nordic and earnings announcements released between 2006 - 2009. <b>The</b> <b>liquidity</b> measure used represents <b>the</b> overall <b>liquidity</b> of a limit order book. <b>The</b> <b>liquidity</b> was studied during 40 minute time window around the releases and compared to <b>the</b> average <b>liquidity</b> during 27 previous trading days. The study found that <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> for large trades is at rather low level before the earnings announcements and the announcements are immediately followed by a peak in illiquidity. However, 20 minutes after <b>the</b> announcements <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> for large trades has returned to a normal level. In contrast to this, <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> for small trades was found to be at rather normal level before the announcement, but after the announcement it remained at higher level. Based on earlier literature, it was proposed that institutional investors supply <b>liquidity</b> before <b>the</b> announcements while many individual investors have canceled their limit orders, and the peak in illiquidity was interpreted to be due to institutional investors changing the behaviour from supplying liquidity to taking it by executing against individuals’ stale limit orders. The peak in illiquidity after the announcement indicated that earnings announcements are followed by momentary increase in information asymmetry. But as <b>the</b> overall <b>liquidity</b> returned to <b>the</b> normal level in 20 minutes after the announcement, using this time period the announcements did seem to decrease information asymmetries...|$|R
