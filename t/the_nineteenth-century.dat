5|$|There were {{experimental}} test operations {{set up to}} see if {{the idea}} was feasible; however, the technology of electrical systems and power grid infrastructures were inadequate in <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> to operate such a system. Another disadvantage was the possibility of power loss caused by wire breaks or electrical equipment failures – which often happened during storms. <b>The</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> idea to replace the existing steam fire engines with electric ones was ahead of its time and never moved forward.|$|E
5|$|The Act 3 ballet is {{regarded}} {{by some as}} {{the first of the}} ballets blancs (whereby the principal ballerina and the corps de ballet are all clothed in white) which became a favourite of <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> repertoire. Later examples include La Sylphide (1832) (also choreographed by Filippo Taglioni and danced by his daughter), Giselle (1841), Pas de Quatre (1845) and Les Sylphides (1909).|$|E
5|$|Generalizing this problem, one can ask {{how many}} lines {{can be drawn}} on a quintic Calabi–Yau manifold, {{such as the one}} {{illustrated}} above, which is defined by a polynomial of degree five. This problem was solved by <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> German mathematician Hermann Schubert, who found that there are exactly 2,875 such lines. In 1986, geometer Sheldon Katz proved that the number of curves, such as circles, that are defined by polynomials of degree two and lie entirely in the quintic is 609,250.|$|E

5|$|The {{group of}} artists {{connected}} with Edinburgh, {{most of whom}} had studied at Edinburgh College of Art during or soon after the First World War, {{became known as the}} Edinburgh School. They were influenced by French painters and the St. Ives School and their art was characterised by use of vivid and often non-naturalistic colour and the use of bold technique above form. Members included William Gillies (1898–1973), who worked in both watercolours and oils around Ardnamurchan and Morar in the 1930s, John Maxwell (1905–62) whose landscapes were influenced by mythological themes, William Crozier (1893–1930), whose landscapes were created with glowing colours and William MacTaggart (1903–81), grandson of <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> artist, noted for his landscapes of East Lothian, France and Norway. His Celebration of Earth, Air, Fire and Water (1978) utilised the Borders' landscape in abstract form.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{considers}} {{three key}} terms in <b>the</b> historiography of <b>nineteenth-century</b> British art, discussing their changing uses and meanings from their usage in the biographies of artists written from the 1880 s onwards, through exhibitions, dealer galleries and sale {{rooms of the}} fin-de-siecle, and through the twentieth century. It provides {{an analysis of the}} 1984 Tate exhibition, The Pre-Raphaelites, as well as more recent displays and shows, to reflect on art history's attention to the individual artist's biographical trajectory and preoccupations with groups and movements which it is argued continue to repeat <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth-century's</b> fascination with <b>the</b> achievements of 'great men'...|$|R
