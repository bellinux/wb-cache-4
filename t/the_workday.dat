5|$|The Lowell female textile workers {{continued}} to petition the Massachusetts Legislature and legislative committee hearings became an annual event. Although the initial {{push for a}} ten-hour workday was unsuccessful, the LFLRA {{continued to}} grow, affiliating with the New England Workingmen's Association and publishing articles in that organization's Voice of Industry, a pro-labor newspaper. This direct pressure forced the Board of Directors of Lowell's textile mills to reduce <b>the</b> <b>workday</b> by 30 minutes in 1847. The FLRA's organizing efforts spilled over into other nearby towns. In 1847, New Hampshire became {{the first state to}} pass a law for a ten-hour workday, although there was no enforcement and workers were often requested to work longer days. By 1848, the LFLRA dissolved as a labor reform organization. Lowell textile workers continued to petition and pressure for improved working conditions, and in 1853, the Lowell corporations reduced <b>the</b> <b>workday</b> to eleven hours.|$|E

5|$|After Game2 {{ended on}} October 3, the Yankees and Cardinals boarded trains to St. Louis, Missouri. The mayor of St. Louis, Victor J. Miller, ordered that <b>the</b> <b>workday</b> end by three the next {{afternoon}} so that the city could welcome the Cardinals at Union Station. The Cardinals players were treated like champions by fans and citizens alike. Just outside the station, Mayor Miller stood at a podium and presented club manager and player Rogers Hornsby with a brand new Lincoln sedan priced at US$4,000 and {{paid for by the}} city's top businessmen. Each member of the Cardinals' team received a new hat, a new pair of shoes, and an engraved white-gold watch valued at a manufacturer's price of $100. As the Cardinals were receiving special treatment from the people of St. Louis, fans were lining up outside Sportsman's Park with the hope of being able to purchase tickets to Game3 for a price of $3.30.|$|E

5|$|By 1994, Copeland's {{mother had}} {{separated}} from Robert. After living with various friends and boyfriends, DelaCerna moved {{with all of}} her children into two small rooms at the Sunset Inn in Gardena, California. In early 1996, Cantine convinced Copeland to attend a ballet class at her local Boys & Girls Club. Cynthia Bradley, a friend of Cantine's, taught a free ballet class at the club once a week. Copeland attended several classes as a spectator before participating. DelaCerna allowed Copeland {{to go to the}} club after school until <b>the</b> <b>workday</b> ended. Bradley invited Copeland to attend class at her small local ballet school, San Pedro Dance Center. Copeland initially declined the offer, however, because her mother did not have a car, was working 12–14 hours a day, and her oldest sister Erica was working two jobs. Copeland began her ballet studies at the age of 13 at the San Pedro Dance Center when Cynthia Bradley began picking her up from school. After three months of study, Copeland was en pointe.|$|E

When lighting was practically the only use of electricity, demand was high during the first hours before <b>the</b> <b>workday</b> and the evening hours when demand peaked. As a consequence, most early electric companies did not provide daytime service, with two-thirds providing no daytime service in 1897.|$|E

25|$|The rising {{standard}} of living under socialism led to a steady decrease in <b>the</b> <b>workday</b> {{and an increase in}} leisure.

25|$|The Federation {{made some}} efforts to obtain {{favorable}} legislation, but had little success in organizing or chartering new unions.

25|$|In January 1894, mine owners {{tried to}} {{lengthen}} <b>the</b> <b>workday</b> for Cripple Creek miners from {{eight to ten}} hours without raising pay. This action provoked a strike by the miners. In response, mine owners brought in strike breakers. The miners intimidated the strike breakers, so the mine owners raised a private army of an estimated 1,200 armed men. The gunmen were deputized by El Paso County Sheriff F. M. Bowers.p.19 The miners were also armed, and were prepared for a confrontation.|$|E
25|$|WFM members {{walked out}} of the ore {{processing}} mills at Telluride on 1 September 1903, for a reduction in <b>the</b> <b>workday</b> from 12 hours to 8. The mill shutdowns caused a shutdown of most of the mines which had no place to send their ore to be processed. The ore mill for the Tom Boy mine tried to reopen with a nonunion workforce, but the WFM struck the Tom Boy mine, and posted picketers armed with pistols and rifles around the Tom Boy, preventing strikebreakers from entering.|$|E
25|$|Peabody was {{a fierce}} {{opponent}} of unions and of any social legislation that limited businesses' right {{to run their}} own affairs as they saw fit. The crucial issue in Colorado was the eight-hour day. When the Legislature had enacted a statute limiting <b>the</b> <b>workday</b> in hazardous industries, such as mining and smelting, to eight hours, the Colorado Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional. The voters of Colorado then passed a referendum authorizing the eight-hour day, but the smelter owners and Republican Party fought any efforts to pass a new statute implementing the amendment.|$|E

A 2002 study reported that urban women averaged 2.1 children per woman, with women living in rural areas having more children, at 2.9. As of the 1990s, both urban and rural women were averaging fewer children than previously. For those women who do have children, after former president Michelle Bachelet's childcare mandates, childcare centers that provide free services are four times more numerous.

25|$|Bagley and the LFLRA {{continued}} sending petitions to {{the state}} legislature for a ten-hour day; they gathered over 10,000 names from throughout Massachusetts, more than 2,000 of which were from working women and men of Lowell. Again hearings were held to investigate working conditions, and again the Massachusetts Legislature refused to take action. However, labor and political pressure on the Lowell textile corporations {{was so great that}} in 1847 the mills shortened <b>the</b> <b>workday</b> by 30 minutes. As the labor reform movement persisted the corporations again reduced the hours of labor to eleven in 1853 and ten in 1874.|$|E
25|$|Several reasons can {{be cited}} {{as to why}} the {{professional}} middle class is so influential. One is that journalists, commentators, writers, professors, economists, and political scientists, who are essential in shaping public opinion, are almost exclusively members of the professional middle class. Considering the overwhelming presence of professional middle-class persons in post secondary education, another essential instrument in regards to shaping public opinion, {{it should come as no}} surprise that the lifestyle exclusive to this quasi-elite has become indicative of the American mainstream itself. In addition to setting trends, the professional middle class also holds occupations which include managerial duties, meaning that middle-class professionals spend much of their work-life directing others and conceptualizing <b>the</b> <b>workday</b> for the average worker.|$|E

500|$|The {{mortar and}} {{aggregate}} of Roman concrete was {{built up in}} horizontal layers laid by hand against wooden form-work with {{the thickness of the}} layers determined by the length of <b>the</b> <b>workday,</b> rather than being poured into a mold as concrete is today. Roman concrete domes were thus built similarly to the earlier corbel domes of the Mediterranean region, although they have different structural characteristics. The aggregate used by the Romans was often rubble, but lightweight aggregate in the upper levels served to reduce stresses. Empty [...] "vases and jugs" [...] could be hidden inside to reduce weight. [...] The dry concrete mixtures used by the Romans were compacted with rams to eliminate voids, and added animal blood acted as a water reducer. Because Roman concrete was weak in tension, it did not provide any structural advantage over the use of brick or stone. But, because it could be constructed with unskilled slave labor, it provided a constructional advantage and facilitated the building of large-scale domes.|$|E

30|$|The {{fact that}} most of the tweets are neutral can be {{explained}} by the fact that they mostly occur during <b>the</b> <b>workdays</b> and that they are mainly aimed at sharing information and pointing to relevant resources.
