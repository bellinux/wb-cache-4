DCPS has one of the highest-cost yet lowest-performing school systems in the country, both in terms of infrastructure and student achievement.

5|$|SR 50, the Paradise Parkway, {{was part}} of Proposition 300 in 1985, but {{was removed from the}} system in December 1994, when then Arizona {{governor}} Fife Symington made some funding cuts that included removal of the Paradise Parkway and Estrella Freeway from the system entirely.

Both codes have adopted innovations parallel to the American game; the rugby union scoring system is almost identical to the American game, while rugby league uses a gridiron-style field and a six-tackle rule similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> of downs in American Football.|$|E
5|$|An upper-level {{anticyclone}} {{north of}} the system provided a more favorable environment for organization, allowing the convection to organize into banding features. The system also developed good outflow, though initially the surface circulation was too elongated {{for it to be}} considered a tropical cyclone. Early on June3, the nearby anticyclone moved northeastward, which increased wind shear over the system and caused it briefly to become less-organized. However, convection increased over the center, and at 1500UTC on June3 the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Two-E about 140mi (240km) southwest of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero; the upgrade was due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> developing sufficiently organized convection, as well as a closed surface circulation.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the system}} was not {{believed}} to have been subtropical. However, there were several post-season findings that confirmed that {{the system was}} indeed a subtropical storm. The first was the cloud pattern, in which it had deep convection around the center and was better organized with a well-defined center of circulation. In addition, the system had a warm core more typical of tropical cyclones as opposed to the cold core of extratropical cyclones. The warm-core nature also meant that there were no warm or cold fronts attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>system,</b> as temperatures did not change ahead of and behind the system until the unrelated cold front passed the Azores. Satellite imagery suggested that the system was briefly a tropical storm as the warm core was found; however, the widespread wind field and the presence of an upper-level trough confirmed that it was merely subtropical.|$|E
