25|$|As {{its title}} suggests, Cvetkovich's book is “organized as ‘an archive of feelings,'” and is “an {{exploration}} of cultural texts as repositories of feelings and emotions, which are encoded {{not only in}} the content of the texts themselves but in the practices that surround their production and reception.” According to Cvetkovich, archives of trauma resemble the archives of gay and lesbian cultures. Not only are ephemera, ephemerality, and memory fundamental to both of these archives, but both also challenge <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> the archive. Cvetkovich's sources – her archive – include oral interviews, performances, fiction, poetry, memoirs, photographs, and films. Theoretically, she engages with feminist, critical race, Marxist, and queer theory.|$|E
25|$|According to Zbigniew Dumienski, <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> human {{trafficking}} is murky and misleading. It {{has been argued}} that while {{human trafficking}} is commonly seen as a monolithic crime, in reality it is an act of illegal migration that involves various different actions: some of them may be criminal or abusive, but others often involve consent and are legal. Laura Agustin argues that not everything that might seem abusive or coercive is considered as such by the migrant. For instance, she states that: 'would-be travellers commonly seek help from intermediaries who sell information, services and documents. When travellers cannot afford to buy these outright, they go into debt'. Dumienski says that while these debts might indeed be on very harsh conditions, they are usually incurred on a voluntary basis.|$|E

Baudrillard argues that in the postmodern epoch, the territory ceases to exist, {{and there is nothing}} left but the map; or indeed, <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> map and the territory have become indistinguishable, the distinction which once existed between them having been erased.|$|R

In particular, van Herk has rooted and uprooted conceptions of the Canadian west and the far north. In 1990, she initiated a new genre she called geografictione, with Places Far From Ellesmere. As a travel narrative that analyzes <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> both travel and narrative, Places Far From Ellesmere questions the mapping of works of fiction, {{as well as the}} journeys that take place within fiction itself, most notably Tolstoy's Anna Karenina.

Ford was always eager to sell to farmers, who looked on the vehicle as a commercial device to help their business.

40|$|We take up {{questions}} of passing/outing as they arise {{for those with}} queer femme identities. We argue that for persons with female-identified bodies and queer, feminine (‘femme’) gender identities, the possibilities above may not exist as distinct options: for example, {{what it means to}} ‘pass’ or ‘cover’ is not always distinguishable – conceptually or in practice – from living authentically and resisting heteronormative identification: i. e. the conditions of being ‘out’. In some ways, these conflations privilege queer femmes; in others, femmes find themselves implicated in a political double bind. We contend that this example problematizes <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> passing and outing, and the political and ethical demands that are taken to arise from them. We conclude by exploring what it means to live queer femme identity responsibly and what this means for the ethics of sexual identity more generally...|$|R

This forum responds to, as well as questions, the current saliency of migration by examining how categories of migration hold geopolitical significance—not only in how they are constructed and by whom, but also in how they are challenged and subverted. Furthermore, by examining how <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> ‘migrant’ and ‘refugee’ are used in different contexts, and {{for a variety of}} purposes, it opens up critical questions for geopolitical research about mobility, citizenship, and the nation state. Collectively, these contributions aim to demonstrate how problematising migration and its categorisation can be a tool of enquiry into other phenomena and processes...|$|R
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the story Tomiko describes Osden's relationship with the planet, saying [...] "He had taken the fear into himself, and, accepting, had transcended it. He had given up his self to the alien, and unreserved surrender, that left no place for evil. He had learned the love of the Other and thereby had been given his whole self." [...] Osden achieves a completely empathetic relationship with the planet, [...] "both literally and figuratively in touch with the forest;" [...] which also grants him temporary goodwill towards humans, as he says [...] "Listen, I will you well" [...] before leaving his colleagues. Le Guin makes another reference to Marvell's poetry at {{the conclusion}} of the story, which refers to the notion of a planetary consciousness. Marvell's poem [...] "The Garden" [...] speaks of [...] "a green thought in a green shade"; Le Guin describes World 4470 as [...] "one big green thought." [...] Le Guin's depiction of the planetary vegetative intelligence is of something that is [...] "whole, undifferentiated and unconscious." [...] Thus, it finds <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> other beings terrifying, and it is qualitatively different from animal intelligences.|$|E

40|$|Prisons are {{exploding}} {{all over}} the world. The number of inmates increases despite a substantial stability {{in the number of}} offences. Simultaneously, we witness a growing sense of insecurity among citizens as shown, inter alia, by the boom in the purchase of weapons for personal defence. In this context, to rethink the nature, function and philosophy of punishment is not a mere academic endeavour, but a necessary exercise in realism. This is the sense of the volume written by Vincenzo Ruggiero who, starting from the classics, critically examines the origin of contemporary justice systems and <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> crime and punishment. He analyses the central tenets of the school of thought known as 'abolitionism', its theoretical origin and philosophy. Abolitionism, here, is not understood as an immediate programme for action, but as approach, a perspective, a methodology, a specific angle of observation which may offer an alternative to repressive practices and lead to the identification of something better than the current penal systems...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary {{social science}} is {{acutely aware of}} what happens when we mark or police boundaries. Cross-cultural {{research}} highlights such issues. Face-to-face interviews and e-mail exchanges with Asian businessmen appeared to suggest clear boundaries between Tanzanian African and Asian “culture. ” However, such ready understanding raises two further issues. First, boundary marking might fit with a colonial methodology used by the early anthropologists to fix a boundary around “native ” populations. Second, <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> “culture ” and “identity ” need deconstruction. Using Sacks’s insistence on the inescapably local and self-constituting character of social interaction, the authors examine what is involved when ethnographers (and laypersons) use categories to describe the world. They conclude with an assessment of what remains of anthropology’s and sociology’s <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> culture given their tendency to fudge the boundary between the descriptive abilities of lay and sociological members. When we arrived at the office of our interviewee, he was talking with another Asian businessman. “What makes two well-dressed women come to this region? ” said the visitor.
