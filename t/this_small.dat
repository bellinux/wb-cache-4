5|$|Dnieper delta: <b>This</b> <b>small</b> area of {{distribution}} in southern Ukraine {{was reported in}} 2005.

This range may also extend to the lower basins of the Dniester and Bug rivers.|$|E

5|$|Einsteinium has a {{high rate}} of nuclear fission that results in a low {{critical}} mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This mass is 9.89 kilograms for a bare sphere of 254Es isotope, and can be lowered to 2.9 by adding a 30 centimeter thick steel neutron reflector, or even to 2.26 kilograms with a 20cm thick reflector made of water. However, even <b>this</b> <b>small</b> critical mass greatly exceeds the total amount of einsteinium isolated thus far, especially of the rare 254Es isotope.|$|E

5|$|Haas {{suggests}} that the labour mobilization patterns revealed by the archaeological evidence point to a unique emergence of human government, one of two alongside Sumer (or three, if Mesoamerica is included as a separate case).

5|$|K–Pg {{boundary}} mammalian {{species were}} generally small, comparable {{in size to}} rats; <b>this</b> <b>small</b> size would have helped them find shelter in protected environments. In addition, it is postulated that some early monotremes, marsupials, and placentals were semiaquatic or burrowing, as there are multiple mammalian lineages with such habits today. Any burrowing or semiaquatic mammal would have had additional protection from K–Pg boundary environmental stresses.|$|E

5|$|Parasites of Theodoxus fluviatilis {{include several}} species of trematodes.

Asymphylodora demeli {{is also found in}} <b>this</b> <b>small</b> snail, as is Notocotylus zduni. <b>This</b> <b>small</b> snail is also parasitized by {{several species of}} ciliates. It is the main host for the ciliate Trichodina baltica; the snails are usually 100% infected in the mantle cavity Another ciliate found in the mantle cavity is a species of Scyphidia. Two other parasitic ciliate species found in this snail are Protospira mazurica, and Hypocomella quatuor. Predators of Theodoxus fluviatilis include the common roach (a freshwater fish), Rutilus rutilus. Theodoxus fluviatilis is also the prey of some birds.|$|E
