5|$|After the ISIS agents reunite and Drake's mutinous crew {{agrees to}} {{surrender}} {{in order to}} prevent his death, Drake has a mental breakdown, declaring humanity to be doomed and killing himself with Pam's rifle. Cyril, startled by the sudden gunfire, opens fire himself, killing three people (one of whom was the only capable pilot of the shuttle other than Drake). To worsen the situation, Barry Dylan (Dave Willis) challenges Archer to fight him in space. Despite the rigorous taunting and demeaning from Barry, Archer ultimately declines his offer. After Archer makes an act of humility, Cyril aims the launches at Barry's jet, subsequently stranding him on Horizon. As the group nears the airstrip, Archer, who wishes <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the landing, messes with the steering shift, causing the spacecraft to crash. Afterwards, every ISIS agent except for Archer is shown to be injured as a result, especially Ray, who is now paralyzed from the waist down (which he ironically had pretended to be earlier in the season).|$|E
5|$|Coolidge {{has often}} been criticized for his actions during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the worst natural {{disaster}} to hit the Gulf Coast until Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Although he did eventually name Secretary Hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief, scholars argue that Coolidge overall showed {{a lack of interest}} in federal flood control. Coolidge did not believe that personally visiting the region after the floods would accomplish anything, {{and that it would be}} seen as mere political grandstanding. He also did not want to incur the federal spending that flood control would require; he believed property owners should bear much of the cost. On the other hand, Congress wanted a bill that would place the federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation. When Congress passed a compromise measure in 1928, Coolidge declined <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> it and signed the bill in private on May 15.|$|E

The group felt that mass demonstrations and electoral {{politics}} were not effective {{as a means of}} influencing national policy. But when the demonstrations proved popular and provoked a heavy-handed police response (as SDS predicted), the organization moved quickly <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the protests.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{political}} {{figures in the}} ancient Near East liked <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> public works. Temples, buildings and statues built by a ruler {{are likely to have}} some sort of inscription mentioning his name. The kings also were sure to record major deeds like battles won, titles acquired, or gods appeased in some form of public inscription. These are very useful in tracking the reign of a ruler.|$|E

After Carnage sacrifices himself to contain the blast, Alex attempts <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> it, but Janet sees through the deception. Although the inversion is undone, the two separate for good when Alex {{is one of three}} characters (the other two being Iron Man and Sabretooth) to remain in their new state.|$|E

25|$|Independent TD Maureen O'Sullivan accused Ahern of {{attempting}} {{in his autobiography}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the Gregory deal by claiming he was present in negotiations between Charles Haughey and Tony Gregory {{and that he had}} provided Haughey with estimates from Dublin City Council. The Gregory deal was an agreement negotiated between the independent socialist TD Tony Gregory and Fianna Fáil leader Charles Haughey {{in the aftermath of the}} February 1982 general election, which resulted in a hung Dáil. In return for supporting Haughey, Gregory was promised a deal worth 100 million pounds at the time, which was to be used to redevelop North Inner City Dublin and to provide a greater number of houses and employment in an area which was considered Ireland's poorest and most disadvantaged. Ahern had gone with Haughey to the negotiations with Gregory; he was immediately asked to leave by Gregory and was forced to wait publicly in his car outside for three and a half hours. Although both had been elected to the same constituency, they were fierce rivals and the relationship between them was often sour. O'Sullivan was Tony Gregory's director of elections and successor as a TD.|$|E
500|$|In the {{following}} years, the name [...] "Boulder Dam" [...] failed to fully take hold, with many Americans using both names interchangeably and mapmakers divided {{as to which}} name should be printed. Memories of the Great Depression faded, and Hoover to some extent rehabilitated himself through good works during and after World War II. In 1947, a bill passed both Houses of Congress unanimously restoring the name [...] "Hoover Dam." [...] Ickes, who was by then a private citizen, opposed the change, stating, [...] "I didn't know Hoover was that small a man <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> something {{he had nothing to}} do with." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{demand more}} for his legal {{expertise}} than his military training, {{he was named}} as assistant counsel for Gideon Johnson Pillow during a court of inquiry initiated against him by Winfield Scott. Seeking to derail Scott's presidential ambitions, Pillow and his supporters composed and published letters that lauded Pillow, not Scott, for the American victories at Contreras and Churubusco. To hide his involvement, Pillow convinced a subordinate <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the letter he wrote. Breckinridge biographer William C. Davis writes that it was [...] "most unlikely" [...] that Breckinridge knew the details of Pillow's intrigue. His role in the proceedings was limited to questioning a few witnesses; records show that Pillow represented himself during the court's proceedings.|$|E

500|$|Karen is more {{competent}} than Plankton in formulating plots {{to steal the}} Krabby Patty recipe. Most of his effective plans have come from Karen, including [...] "Plan Z"—the only scheme to result in Plankton successfully stealing the formula and using it to his advantage—in The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. Nonetheless, he tends <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> them, much to her dismay. Karen has effortlessly stolen Krabs' formula without Plankton's help on many occasions, but her husband always inadvertently gets in the way. Because of their contrasting behaviors, Plankton and Karen {{have a tendency to}} argue. Tom Kenny, SpongeBob's voice actor, has called their marriage [...] "Honeymooners-like," [...] comparing them to the bickering couple from the sitcom The Honeymooners.|$|E
500|$|Lindsay Lohan's Indian Journey {{received}} extensive negative {{media coverage}} since its inception. The BBC were heavily criticized for hiring Lohan despite her then recent widely publicized drink-driving conviction and [...] "party lifestyle". BBC said they chose Lohan to attract {{an audience that}} might otherwise not watch. Indian non-governmental organization, Bachpan Bachao Andolan, criticized Lohan for a Twitter post where she appeared <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> one of their raids, something BBC said was a misinterpretation. The media coverage did not translate to high ratings. In its original broadcast on BBC Three on 1 April 2010, it was viewed by 224,000 households, a 0.9% share of the audience. Critics complimented the documentary for being well researched and compelling, but found Lohan's presence to be odd and distracting.|$|E
500|$|In a {{continuing}} attempt by Universal Interactive <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> Crash Bandicoot, Naughty Dog {{was told that}} it was not [...] "allowed" [...] to go to the first Electronic Entertainment Expo. In addition, there were leaked copies of the temporary box cover and press materials for the Electronic Entertainment Expo, upon which the Naughty Dog logo, in violation of the contract between Naughty Dog and Universal Interactive, was omitted. In response, Jason Rubin drafted and printed 1,000 copies of a document entitled [...] "Naughty Dog, creator and developer of Crash Bandicoot" [...] to hand {{out in front of the}} Crash Bandicoot display at the Electronic Entertainment Expo. Beforehand, Rubin passed out the flyers [...] "for review" [...] to Universal Interactive, angering its president. Crash Bandicoot was first shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo on May 1996 and was met with enthusiastic reactions. The game was released on September 9, 1996. This was followed by its European release on November 8, 1996.|$|E

500|$|On July 16, 1945, with {{numerous}} other Manhattan Project personnel, von Neumann was an eyewitness {{to the first}} atomic bomb blast, code named Trinity, conducted {{as a test of}} the implosion method device, at the bombing range near Alamogordo Army Airfield, [...] southeast of Socorro, New Mexico. Based on his observation alone, von Neumann estimated the test had resulted in a blast equivalent to [...] but Enrico Fermi produced a more accurate estimate of 10 kilotons by dropping scraps of torn-up paper as the shock wave passed his location and watching how far they scattered. The actual power of the explosion had been between 20 and 22 kilotons. It was in von Neumann's 1944 papers that the expression [...] "kilotons" [...] appeared for the first time. After the war, Robert Oppenheimer remarked that the physicists involved in the Manhattan project had [...] "known sin". Von Neumann's response was that [...] "sometimes someone confesses a sin in order <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|The Nova Scotia {{legislature}} {{recognized the}} growing power of industrial unions in the 1930s by passing what historian Stephen Henderson calls [...] "Canada's {{first piece of}} modern labour legislation". Although Macdonald's governing Liberals and the opposition Conservatives agreed {{on the need to}} protect union rights, the parties vied with each other <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the Trade Union Act. In January 1937, Premier Macdonald carried a bottle of bootleg rum to a meeting with union officials in Sydney, Cape Breton where they gave him a draft bill based on the American National Labor Relations Act. Before the Macdonald government could introduce the bill in the legislature, the Conservatives presented a similar one of their own. The legislation faced opposition from the Canadian Manufacturers' Association during public hearings, but Liberals and Conservatives combined to pass it unanimously. The new Trade Union Act required employers to bargain with any union chosen by a majority of their employees. It also prohibited employers from firing workers for organizing a union.|$|E
500|$|Goodrem's manager, Glenn Wheatley, {{suggested}} making Nina into {{an aspiring}} singer. He said: [...] "We didn't want that soap star-turned-singer vibe but how cool {{would it be}} if she already was a singer? Neighbours developed a character to suit her {{rather than the other}} way around." [...] Goodrem worked with the writers to incorporate her music into the show, and Wheatley used the exposure that Neighbours gave Goodrem to relaunch her singing career. Nina had a powerful voice and wrote her own songs, but she was too shy to sing them in public. Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) discovered Nina's singing talent one day, and Connor entered one of her songs, [...] "Born To Try", in a talent contest at UniFM, where it won. As Nina was too shy to go and receive the prize, Tahnee Coppin (Anna Jennings-Edquist) tried <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the song instead. Connor stopped her and Nina overcame her shyness to sing her song. Within weeks of it being performed, [...] "Born to Try" [...] became the number one single in Australia.|$|E
50|$|While some Italian prints {{reportedly}} give second unit director Antonio Margheriti credit {{as director}} of the film, Kier has stated that Margheriti {{had nothing to do with}} directing the film. Kier stated that he and the other cast members received direction only from Morrissey, and noted that he never saw Margheriti on the set. As a favor for producer Carlo Ponti -whose name was in the Italian poster, but didn't actually took part in the making of Blood for Dracula- Margheriti agreed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credits</b> <b>for</b> free as the director for the Italian release, in order to help the film get funds from the government.

Ace threatens the boys with a knife, but Petey pulls out a gun to intimidate Ace, who swears he will come back for revenge and could get a gun tomorrow. However, since their next meeting will be inevitable, as they live in the same neighborhood, Petey lets Ace have the body to avoid further consequences. Upon returning home, the boys go their separate ways; Joey comes to terms with being crippled and creates a new wheelchair rugby game called [...] "Don't-Feel-Sorry-For-Us-Ball", Cleve grows up to marry Rebecca Romijn (who is the real-life wife of Jerry O'Connell, who played the character of [...] "the fat kid" [...] in the actual film), and Quag grows up to become a famous Hollywood actor who eventually dies of a drug overdose (a reference to the fact River Phoenix, who played Chris Chambers in the actual film, went the same way and the unseen adult version of Chris dies, but in a different manner), while Petey's fate becomes a mystery.|$|E
500|$|A pun, the character's name [...] "Kim Possible" [...] {{alludes to}} the word [...] "impossible". Kim is {{referred}} to by several nicknames by various characters throughout the series, including K.P. (Ron); Kimmy Cub (James); K, Miss Perfect, Tin Teeth (Bonnie); Princess, Pumpkin, Cupcake, Miss Snooty, Miss Priss (Shego); and Kimmie by miscellaneous. Unlike traditional superheroes and secret agents, Kim lacks a secret identity; the character is known simply as [...] "Kim Possible, and everyone who knows her knows what she does." [...] Kadeen Griffiths of Bustle observed that Kim [...] "never put on spandex or acquired a secret identity; instead, {{she had her own}} website where people could book her for jobs with a tagline that promised that she could do anything", a claim reinforced by {{the fact that she is}} capable of fighting crime while continuing to perform well in high school and remaining captain of her school's cheerleading squad. Writing for Women Write About Comics, Jamie Kingston observed that Middleton High School [...] "ignores her as a heroine unless something happens on school grounds where she has to do her thing." [...] Thus, Kim rarely receives attention for her work from her family and peers, although her customers remain grateful. However, while describing Kim as a [...] "power fantasy", Stealing Commas believes that Kim is simply [...] "preventing regime change" [...] and [...] "Preserving the status quo rather than doing any real world saving." [...] According to Metacritic, Kim [...] "is stubborn, strong-willed, and has a fuse shorter than a grenade with a three second delay" [...] but remains [...] "extremely humble, refusing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> her truly amazing actions." [...] Meanwhile, David Horiuchi of Amazon.com wrote that the character is [...] "tough, witty, and refreshingly free of any saucy teen attitude." ...|$|E
