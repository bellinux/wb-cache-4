5|$|Also in 1957, Florida's {{response}} was mixed. Its legislature passed an Interposition Resolution denouncing {{the decision and}} declaring it null and void.

5|$|As {{an effect}} of Waddington's intervention, Romania also agreed {{to resolve the issue}} of Jewish Emancipation. The {{government}} pledged itself to naturalize all of its non-Christian residents (see History of the Jews in Romania). Kogălniceanu himself made efforts <b>to</b> <b>overturn</b> this decision, and was bitter when the Germans refused to compromise. The resolution was debated inside Romania over the following year, and such a measure in respect to Jews was not introduced until 1922–1923.|$|E

5|$|Charing Cross was {{a central}} staging post for coaches, but the {{congested}} narrow road was a frequent scene of accidents; here, a bonfire has caused the Salisbury Flying Coach <b>to</b> <b>overturn.</b> Festive bonfires were usual but risky: a house fire lights the sky in the distance. A link-boy blows on the flame of his torch, street-urchins are playing with the fire, and one of their fireworks is falling in at the coach window.|$|E

5|$|Given the {{willingness}} of the players to cross the picket lines and networks to broadcast the replacement games, despite a 20% drop in television viewership and even steeper drops in attendance, the union failed to achieve their demands. The strike ended on October 15, 1987, without a collective bargaining agreement in place.

5|$|The team's never-say-die attitude, {{instilled in}} {{previous}} seasons, was {{key to their}} success as the players often thrived in difficult situations. The highlight was United's dramatic comeback in the Champions League final, when Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær each scored in injury time <b>to</b> <b>overturn</b> Bayern Munich's first-half lead. David Beckham was runner up to Rivaldo for 1999's European Footballer of the Year and FIFA World Player of the Year awards.|$|E
5|$|This was {{a blow to}} the {{short-range}} committee, who {{had made}} good progress on the specification. Despite being technically superior, FACT had not been created with portability in mind or through manufacturer and user consensus. It also lacked a demonstrable implementation, allowing supporters of a FLOW-MATIC-based COBOL <b>to</b> <b>overturn</b> the resolution. RCA representative Howard Bromberg also blocked FACT, so that RCA's work on a COBOL implementation would not go to waste.|$|E

Prior to 1914, the free speech movement focused on politics, and rarely addressed contraception.|$|E

In 1810, Robert Brown transferred it into Rhagodia as Rhagodia billardierei, but this name was illegal, as there were no grounds for the specific epithet <b>to</b> be <b>to</b> <b>overturned.</b> In 1849, Alfred Moquin-Tandon transferred the species into Rhagodia as R. baccata, and this name remained current until 2012. After phylogenetic research, Fuentes-Bazan et al. (2012) included Rhagodia again in genus Chenopodium.|$|R

In March 2012, Pitt was featured in a performance of Dustin Lance Black's play, '8'— a staged reenactment of the federal trial that overturned California's Prop 8 ban on same-sex marriage— as Judge Vaughn Walker.|$|E
5|$|Proponents of the Act, {{including}} Trumbull and Wilson, {{argued that}} Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment authorized {{the federal government}} to legislate civil rights for the States.
