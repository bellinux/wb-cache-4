500|$|... {{stopping}} {{to play as}} they went". Logg was often asked when he would be leaving by employees eager to play the prototype, so he created a second prototype specifically for staff to play. Atari went to Sacramento, California for testing, setting up prototypes {{of the game in}} local arcades to measure its potential success. The company also observed veteran players and younger players during focus group sessions at Atari itself. A group of old players familiar with Spacewar! struggled to maintain grip on the <b>thrust</b> <b>button</b> and requested a joystick, whereas younger players accustomed to Space Invaders noted they get no break in the game. Logg and other Atari engineers observed proceedings and documented comments in four pages.|$|E
5000|$|The {{standard}} {{punch and}} kick buttons are complemented by a shoot button (for firing beam rifles or machine guns), a weapon button (beam sabers, heat hawks, etc.), and a <b>thrust</b> <b>button</b> {{that allows the}} mobile suit to fly indefinitely. This is similar to Endless Duel, as well as games such as Capcom's Cyberbots.|$|E
5000|$|A mobile suit can {{no longer}} fly indefinitely. Instead, each press of the <b>thrust</b> <b>button</b> costs one boost bar. When the gauge is empty, the mobile suit must {{wait for it to}} {{recharge}} before boosting again. The mobile suit can also activate a free flight mode that allows it to fly in any direction and not get fazed by any attack as long as it doesn't overheat or the boost gauge runs out. The only exception is the mobile armor Neue Ziel, which is always in flight mode.|$|E
60|$|Ugi {{had dropped}} astern, and the ARLA was sliding along through a summer sea toward the wooded ranges of Malaita. The {{helmsman}} who so attracted Bertie's eyes sported a ten penny nail, stuck skewerwise through his nose. About his neck was {{a string of}} pants <b>buttons.</b> <b>Thrust</b> through holes in his ears were a can opener, the broken handle of a toothbrush, a clay pipe, the brass wheel of an alarm clock, and several Winchester rifle cartridges.|$|R
5|$|Sonic and the Secret Rings is a {{three-dimensional}} platform and action game featuring an on-rails style of movement. Sonic the Hedgehog, the series' main character, is the game's only player character. He is controlled exclusively with the Wii Remote, which is held horizontally like a traditional gamepad. Players adjust his forward movement by tilting the controller. He runs along a predesignated path; players jump and brake using corresponding face <b>buttons.</b> <b>Thrusting</b> the Wii Remote forwards allows Sonic {{to perform a}} homing attack, a mid-air move that targets and damages enemies in his path.|$|R
50|$|Set in {{the year}} 2003, the game {{involves}} using a spaceship to destroy enemy droid ships. The player's ship is controlled with a spinner to rotate the ship, a <b>button</b> for <b>thrusting,</b> and a <b>button</b> for firing lasers. The enemies that the player must destroy or avoid are drone ships, commander ships, two types of space mines, and shooting star ships. The ship bounces off an invisible barrier {{on the edges of}} the screen that briefly appears when hit. By default, Extra ships are awarded at 40,000 and 100,000 points, but this can be changed by the machine's owner.|$|R
50|$|The {{asteroid}} belt now changes into {{a swarm of}} flying saucers, some of which drop bombs. The player must now guide the spacecraft {{back up to the}} mothership (the craft ascends without using up fuel), avoiding the flying saucers. The <b>thrust</b> <b>button</b> is now a fire button which can be used to shoot at enemies above (as in Space Invaders). Finally, the craft must be docked with the mothership using the bay opening. If the side of the mothership or any part of the ship outside of the opening is hit, the rescued astronaut falls to the surface and dies. If the mothership is missed altogether, the craft explodes. After all six people have been rescued (or killed providing the player still has lives remaining), the game starts again at a higher level.|$|E
5000|$|A {{prototype}} of Asteroids was well received by several Atari staff and engineers, who would [...] "wander between labs, passing comment and stopping {{to play as}} they went". Logg was often asked when he would be leaving by employees eager to play the prototype, so he created a second prototype specifically for staff to play. Atari went to Sacramento, California for testing, setting up prototypes {{of the game in}} local arcades to measure its potential success. The company also observed veteran players and younger players during focus group sessions at Atari itself. A group of old players familiar with Spacewar! struggled to maintain grip on the <b>thrust</b> <b>button</b> and requested a joystick, whereas younger players accustomed to Space Invaders noted they get no break in the game. Logg and other Atari engineers observed proceedings and documented comments in four pages.|$|E
50|$|The game {{starts with}} the player's {{spacecraft}} docked inside the mothership {{at the top of}} the screen. Below the mothership is an asteroid field and below that, the surface of the moon. There are three platforms which can be landed on and six stranded astronauts that need rescuing. You control a small spacecraft. The player must press the button to release their spacecraft from the mothership and manoeuvre through the asteroid field. The craft can only move left or right or use up a finite amount of fuel by engaging the <b>thrust</b> (the same <b>button</b> again) to slow its descent. If the craft is landed successfully on one of the available platforms, one of the astronauts will run towards and board the craft.|$|R
60|$|Caleb was a {{powerful}} man and knew little of any fear except the fear of hurting others {{and the fear of}} having to speechify. But he felt it his duty at this moment to try and give a little harangue. There was a striking mixture in him--which came from his having always been a hard-working man himself--of rigorous notions about workmen and practical indulgence towards them. To do a good day's work and to do it well, he held to be part of their welfare, as it was the chief part of his own happiness; but he had a strong sense of fellowship with them. When he advanced towards the laborers they had not gone to work again, but were standing in that form of rural grouping which consists in each turning a shoulder towards the other, at a distance of two or three yards. They looked rather sulkily at Caleb, who walked quickly with one hand in his pocket and the other <b>thrust</b> between the <b>buttons</b> of his waistcoat, and had his every-day mild air when he paused among them.|$|R
50|$|Smythe is a scientist, {{and takes}} {{the seat of the}} {{co-pilot}} on Commander Drax reconnaissance mission about the Christopher-Floyd impact.He is described as being annoying, uncaring and selfish from the beginning. After the impact he <b>thrusts</b> the emergency <b>button</b> of his seat and is thatfor partially responsible for the crash landing of Drax’s jet.Smythe is found later by a group of Nosfera, artificially evolved humans, who feed from blood. He manages to become their leader by electrocuting them until they become obedient.Smythe takes the name Jacobo. He plans to breed a Herrenrasse from the Nosfera. Maddrax and Aruula discover Jacobo and his followers in the ruins of former northern Italy. Jacobo captures them and decides to use Aruulas body to breed his new race. After fighting the local Nosfera, Aruula and Maddrax leave to visit Rome, thinking that Jacobo died.The scientist survived and from now on his attitude is revenge. He later succeeds in capturing Aruula and implants an electrocuting device inside her leg. He thinks this will force her to obey like his Nosfera do. Aruula claims that Maddrax {{can be found on the}} ‘dreizehn Inseln’, the remains of today’s Denmark and the home of Aruulas people. Back at her home, she secretly manages that the electrocuter is implanted inside a highly dangerous mutated ice-bear. Because the device serves also as a tracking tool, Jacobo is drawn to the predator. Instead of being killed, the former scientist manages to gain control about the bear. Jacobo continues to thread Maddrax and his companions.|$|R
60|$|This is the house, 22 Little Owlet Street, Marylebone, {{but which}} were his rooms {{it is less}} easy to determine, for he was a lodger who flitted placidly from floor to floor {{according}} to the state of his finances, carrying his apparel and other belongings in one great armful, and spilling by the way. On this particular evening he was on the second floor front, which had a fireplace in the corner, furniture all his landlady's and mostly horsehair, little to suggest his calling save a noble saucerful of ink, and nothing to draw attention from Pym, who lolled, gross and massive, on a sofa, one leg over the back of it, the other drooping, his arms extended, and his pipe, which he could find nowhere, <b>thrust</b> between the <b>buttons</b> of his waistcoat, an agreeable pipe-rack. He wore a yellow dressing-gown, or could scarcely be said to wear it, for such of it as was not round his neck he had converted into a cushion for his head, which is perhaps the part of him we should have turned to first It was a big round head, the plentiful gray hair in tangles, possibly because in Pym's last flitting the comb had dropped over the banisters; the features were ugly and beyond life-size, yet the forehead had altered little except in colour since the day when he was near being made a fellow of his college; there was sensitiveness left in the thick nose, humour in the eyes, though they so often watered; the face had gone to flabbiness at last, but not without some lines and dents, as if the head had resisted the body for a space before the whole man rolled contentedly downhill.|$|R
60|$|Chad Cranage {{looks like}} quite a new {{acquaintance}} to-day, for {{he has got}} his clean Sunday face, which always makes his little granddaughter cry at him as a stranger. But an experienced eye would have fixed on him at once as the village blacksmith, after seeing the humble deference with which the big saucy fellow {{took off his hat}} and stroked his hair to the farmers; for Chad was accustomed to say that a working-man must hold a candle to a personage understood to be as black as he was himself on weekdays; by which evil-sounding rule of conduct he meant what was, after all, rather virtuous than otherwise, namely, that men who had horses to be shod must be treated with respect. Chad and the rougher sort of workmen kept aloof from the grave under the white thorn, where the burial was going forward; but Sandy Jim, and several of the farm-labourers, made a group round it, and stood with their hats off, as fellow-mourners with the mother and sons. Others held a midway position, sometimes watching the group at the grave, sometimes listening to the conversation of the farmers, who stood in a knot near the church door, and were now joined by Martin Poyser, while his family passed into the church. On the outside of this knot stood Mr. Casson, the landlord of the Donnithorne Arms, in his most striking attitude--that is to say, with the forefinger of his right hand <b>thrust</b> between the <b>buttons</b> of his waistcoat, his left hand in his breeches pocket, and his head very much on one side; looking, on the whole, like an actor who has only a mono-syllabic part entrusted to him, but feels sure that the audience discern his fitness for the leading business; curiously in contrast with old Jonathan Burge, who held his hands behind him and leaned forward, coughing asthmatically, with an inward scorn of all knowingness that could not be turned into cash. The talk was in rather a lower tone than usual to-day, hushed a little by the sound of Mr. Irwine's voice reading the final prayers of the burial-service. They had all had their word of pity for poor Thias, but now they had got upon the nearer subject of their own grievances against Satchell, the Squire's bailiff, who played the part of steward so far as it was not performed by old Mr. Donnithorne himself, for that gentleman had the meanness to receive his own rents and make bargains about his own timber. This subject of conversation was an additional reason for not being loud, since Satchell himself might presently be walking up the paved road to the church door. And soon they became suddenly silent; for Mr. Irwine's voice had ceased, and the group round the white thorn was dispersing itself towards the church.|$|R
