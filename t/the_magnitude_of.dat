5|$|The {{accuracy}} of the measured value of the Avogadro constant is currently limited by the uncertainty {{in the value of}} the Planck constant—a measure relating the energy of photons to their frequency. That relative standard uncertainty has been 50parts per billion (ppb) since 2006. By fixing the Avogadro constant, the practical effect of this proposal would be that the uncertainty in the mass of a 12C atom—and <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> the kilogram—could be no better than the current 50ppb uncertainty in the Planck constant. Under this proposal, <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> the kilogram would be subject to future refinement as improved measurements of the value of the Planck constant become available; electronic realizations of the kilogram would be recalibrated as required. Conversely, an electronic definition of the kilogram (see Electronic approaches, below), which would precisely fix the Planck constant, would continue to allow 83⅓ moles of 12C to have a mass of precisely one kilogram but the number of atoms comprising a mole (the Avogadro constant) would continue to be subject to future refinement.|$|E

Further, the world's national metrology laboratories must wait for the fourth periodic verification to confirm whether the historical trendspersisted.|$|E
