The journalist Giampaolo Pansa [...] visited the old boss that year and described the decline in an article entitled The sunset of the mafia (in Italian: Il tramonto del mafioso) in which he depicted the old boss in rather squalid and degenerating circumstances {{after the death of}} his wife Rosalia. He did not answer the many questions and denied the existence of the Mafia: [...] "Mafia? Mafia in Sicily?

2500|$|As to the radula of this species, it is a {{very small}} and rather obscure object, and only by teasing it to pieces, I could get an idea of the shape of the teeth. The uncini quite cover the median rows, and cross even the uncini of the {{opposite}} side. The rhachidian or median tooth has a subquadrate basal part, with rounded, convex posterior and less convex lateral margins. It has a broad, triangular cusp, with one small median denticle and about 6 smaller ones on each side. The laterals one on each side, have a transversely triangular shape, with an unarmed, arched upper and concave proximal and basal margin, with blunt points at the proximal and distal extremities of the basal margin. On each side I see at least 3, but I suppose there are 4 uncini which are long, slender and strongly curved. Though this radula has some resemblance with that of Aporrhais, like Verrill (Mollusca of the New England coast. Transact. Connecticut Acad, of arts and sciences, Vol. VI, May 1884, p. 1S6 and 188) has stated, and like his figure (I.e. pi. 31, fig. 14b) affirms, I cannot agree without doubt with his view that it should be taenioglossate, as the [...] "Siboga"-specimen has a radula with at least 9 rows of teeth and probably 11. The nacreous character of the shell agrees with the Rhipidoglossa, and so does the larger number of uncini. I should think the genus will belong to the Rhipidoglossa with a restricted number of teeth, such as Basilissa. As however only a knowledge of other anatomical particulars, the position and structure of the gills, of the heart etc. can decide <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> left the family near Trichotropis in accordance with the newest systematic arrangement of Paul Pelseneer (A treatise on Zoology, edited by Ray Lankester, Part V, Mollusca, 1906, p.156) ...|$|E

6000|$|For my own part, I was bewildered. All <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{not asked}} before came {{crowding}} {{to my mind}} how. Whose child was this? Whence had he come? What was the meaning of it all? ...|$|R
60|$|I retired early {{so as to}} be on {{hand the}} next day. Sleep was out of <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never been a hundred miles away from Darbyville, and the {{prospect}} of leaving filled me with excitement.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bruff {{proved to}} be too busy to give me {{more than a minute}} of his {{valuable}} time. In that minute, however, he contrived to dispose--in the most discouraging manner--of all <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to put to him.|$|R

60|$|His {{anxiety was}} an answer, a {{sufficient}} answer, to <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> put to him. An answer containing all {{the difficulty of}} that situation. I closed the port-hole quietly, to make sure. A louder word might have been overheard.|$|R

60|$|I {{soon came}} to know that <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> asked of <b>the</b> {{sergeant}} was being discussed by all the garrison, {{many of the men}} declaring that Reuben Cox deserved to be treated as any other deserter, while a large number claimed that the sufferings he had endured should be considered as having atoned for the crime.|$|R

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> spoken both of [...] "sound" [...] and of [...] "voice."

6000|$|Miss Barrington smiled. [...] "I almost believe so, too, {{but others}} {{of his family}} have done such things {{somewhat}} frequently.

But I must be more in want of a friend, or an agreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take the trouble of conquering any body's reserve to procure one. Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{no reason to think}} ill of her--not the least--except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner, such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body, is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{while on}} this digression, let me repeat <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{repeated}} to myself ten thousand times. WHY DID I DRINK? What need {{was there for}} it? I was happy. Was it because I was too happy? I was strong. Was it because I was too strong? Did I possess too much vitality? I don't know why I drank. I cannot answer, though I can voice the suspicion that ever grows in me. I had been in too-familiar contact with John Barleycorn through too many years. A left-handed man, by long practice, can become a right-handed man. Had I, a non-alcoholic, by long practice become an alcoholic? ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was at the}} hotel, in Gordon's apartment, late in the afternoon.

At last the deluge abated, the clouds began to break--there was a promise of a fine evening. Gordon Wright, while the storm was at its climax, sat down to write letters, and wrote half a dozen. It was after he had sealed, directed and affixed a postage-stamp to the last of the series that he addressed to his companion <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> just quoted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor his family; nor {{anything}} of their antecedents? He {{is a man}} fallen out of the moon. All that is nothing to us as passing acquaintances.

He seems to be a friend of yours. You had better make him understand that it is quite out of <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> told him so, and you had better repeat it."
