5|$|According to his biographer, John M. Taylor, Seward {{picked a}} good time to absent himself from electoral politics, as the Whig Party was in turmoil. President Tyler, a former Democrat, and Senator Clay each claimed {{leadership}} of the Whig Party and, as the two men differed over such issues as whether to re-establish the Bank of the United States, party support was divided. The abolitionist movement attracted those {{who did not want to}} be part of a party led by slavery-supporting southerners. In 1844, Seward was asked to run for president by members of the Liberty Party; he declined and reluctantly supported the Whig nominee, Clay. The Kentuckian was defeated by Democrat James K. Polk. The major event of Polk's administration was the Mexican–American War; Seward did not support <b>this,</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> the price in blood was not worth the increase in territory, especially as southerners were promoting this acquisition to expand territory for slavery.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the day, Srebrenica {{had fallen}} to Bosnian Serb forces, who began a brutal {{campaign}} of ethnic cleansing that left roughly 7,000 men dead. In the wake of this tragedy, many observers blamed NATO for failing to use its airpower more forcefully. David Rohde, a journalist, later wrote that [...] "if NATO close air support had been used earlier... the 7,079 missing might still be alive today". <b>This</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> NATO could have prevented thousands of deaths by acting more strongly led to increased planning for Operation Deliberate Force.|$|E
500|$|Bryan's announcement, after {{gaining the}} Democratic nomination, {{that he would}} {{undertake}} a nationwide tour by rail, something then unusual for presidential candidates, put pressure on McKinley to match him. Hanna especially urged his candidate to hit the road. McKinley decided against <b>this,</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> he could not outdo Bryan, who was a brilliant stump speaker, {{and that he would}} be foolish to try. [...] "I might as well put up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete against some professional athlete as go out speaking against Bryan. I have to think when I speak." [...] Furthermore, no matter how McKinley traveled, Bryan would upstage him by choosing a less comfortable manner. McKinley was unwilling to compete with Bryan on the Democrat's terms, and sought to find his own way to reach the people.|$|E

500|$|In an {{overview}} of the fourth season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Herrenvolk" [...] was rated an A-. It was noted that the episode [...] "makes good use of locations", and the ambiguous resolution to Jeremiah Smith's plot arc was seen as a positive, as it [...] "opens the door to all sorts of provocative potentialities". Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode a B+, though he felt it suffered from [...] "treading-water plotting". Handlen also described the episode as being tense on its own, but suffering from [...] "stagnation" [...] when held as part of the series' ongoing mythology. He cited the death of X as an example of <b>this,</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> the scene was [...] "appropriately shocking" [...] and perhaps [...] "one of the most memorable deaths in the series"—however, the almost immediate introduction of a successor character, Marita Covarrubias, was seen as [...] "deflat the importance" [...] of the events.|$|E
500|$|Obsidian drew {{on older}} {{computer}} RPGs for inspiration on the storyline and gameplay, like Fallout and the Ultima series. Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart said [...] "We've {{been thinking about}} a lot of older RPGs, and we have <b>this</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> something has been lost with recent RPGs." [...] He compared Neverwinter Nights 2 to Baldur's Gate II, stating that he wanted to expand upon the city of Neverwinter as Baldur's Gate II had done with its setting, Athkatla. [...] "We're looking at how to make Neverwinter a really intriguing place to be, and make it a place where you go and come back to and go and come back to and have it really be a center for the game," [...] Urquhart said. The game's story, while still revolving around the city of Neverwinter, would be unrelated to Neverwinter Nights. Instead of starting the game as a powerful, important character, players would begin Neverwinter Nights 2 as nobodies. Obsidian wanted realism in the game and concrete consequences for the player's actions. The story would be centered on the player character, who would have to gradually earn the respect of Lord Nasher and the city of Neverwinter.|$|E
500|$|Duerr {{provides}} additional ethnographic examples {{showing how}} societal rules were reversed at special {{times of the}} year. In shamanic terms, societies which espouse an [...] "archaic mentality" [...] understand who they are by understanding who they are not; according to Duerr, modern societies fail to understand this concept. [...] Datura, a plant that contains toxic hallucinogens is discussed. [...] The plant was introduced to Europe in the early modern period. [...] Among the Huichol people of central Mexico, shamans have told anthropologists that Datura is used by malevolent witches. Duerr makes note of the anthropologists who have undertaken shamanic experiences with the people they are studying, such as Barbara Myerhoff and Carlos Castenada, but argues that such ethnographers have failed to truly understand what shamans mean when they describe their experiences as [...] "flying". In Duerr's view, shamans learn to evaporate their [...] "ego boundaries", thereby experiencing themselves in a different way; it is <b>this</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> {{can be described as}} shamanic flying. Duerr ties these shamanic practices into the werewolves of early modern Europe, arguing that these werewolves did not physically transform into wolves, but that they embraced their [...] "wolf nature" [...] by crossing over the boundary from [...] "civilisation" [...] to [...] "wilderness".|$|E

500|$|CDJournal online reviewers {{gave the}} album their star of recommendation, praised {{the variety of}} sounds and tempos on the album, {{as well as the}} [...] "peculiar musical world" [...] created by Yamaguchi's [...] "dry" [...] vocals layered on top of a [...] "floating-feeling" [...] techno and [...] "funky" [...] sound. They further noted Sakanaction's intense usage of {{surround}} sound during the album. Reviewer Yuji Tayama praised the album for its multi-faceted nature, and focused his praise on Emi Okazaki's keyboard work, the band's [...] "funky rhythms" [...] and vocalist Ichiro Yamaguchi's [...] "nostalgic, youthful vocals". He felt the album had a [...] "dazzling" [...] and [...] "refined" [...] pop sense echoed in their [...] "clear 'vocal post-rock' sound", and described the album as being [...] "at times colorful like the pattern of a tropical fish, and at times gloomy like the mood of a deep sea fish". Mayumi Tsuchida of Bounce felt the album's strength was the harmony between the [...] " [...] band sound smeared with techno and electronica" [...] and Yamaguchi's sorrowful, literary lyrics. She singled out [...] "Shiranami Top Water" [...] as the best example of <b>this,</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> its [...] "bouncy synths and elegant guitar" [...] worked together to [...] "paint a spiral" [...] and soared together, to create [...] "breathtaking beauty". Retrospectively, Entertainment Media Kulture felt that the album showed Sakanaction {{still in the process of}} finding their sound, with many aspects feeling avant-garde.|$|E

"At one death ceremony…I had <b>this</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> – {{it was so}} dark, {{about an}} hour before dawn – in that sky there, so clearly lit by the stars – I had this feeling of seeing all the spirits at once of all the animals and all the people that had run in that {{particular}} bit of country and …was it dense! everywhere, thousands of them.

'Beautiful filly, beautiful filly...' She never stops, you never feel uncomfortable with her, {{she knows how to}} talk to everybody. And I got <b>this</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> she was like, 'Oh, don't worry, I'll work the Christmas holidays, I can do that show, I'll work Boxing Day as well, nothing like the holidays.'

50|$|Birkin {{wrote the}} script for Boxes in 1995, shortly after her father's death. The film was shot in Birkin's own family home in Landéda. Birkin offered the main role of Anna to Chaplin, but Chaplin turned <b>this</b> down, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> as the role was written for a 45-year-old woman, she would be better suited {{to the role of}} Anna's mother.|$|R
2500|$|In November 2016, Feige {{confirmed}} that Keaton would play the Vulture, the Adrian Toomes {{incarnation of the}} character, while Woodbine was revealed as Herman Schultz / Shocker. In March 2017, Harrier said the film was undergoing reshoots, and Evans was set to appear as Steve Rogers / Captain America in an instructional fitness video. Watts was inspired by The President's Fitness Challenge for <b>this,</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> Captain America would be the obvious version of that for the MCU. He then started brainstorming other public service announcements (PSA) starring Captain America, [...] "about just everything, [...] brushing your teeth. Just anything you could think of, we had poor Captain America do it." [...] Watts said {{that many of the}} additional PSA videos would be featured on the home media of the film. Watts {{confirmed that}} the company Stark creates that leads Toomes on his villainous path in the film is Damage Control, which Watts felt [...] "just fit in with our overall philosophy with the kind of story we wanted to tell" [...] and created a lot of practical questions Watts wanted to use [...] "to drive the story".|$|E
2500|$|Both sides accuse {{each other}} of using underhanded tactics {{to pack the}} {{commission}} with countries sympathetic to their position. Edwin Snagg, the IWC commissioner for St Vincent and the Grenadines stated, [...] "It's a question of respect,....Because you are small and because you are underdeveloped there is this view and there is <b>this</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> you can easily be bought and you can easily be sold. We in the Caribbean feel highly offended." [...] Moreover, there are no developing countries who support an anti-whaling stance. The BBC reported that [...] "Some countries recently admitted to the European Union have been advised by a [...] "word in the ear" [...] {{that it would be}} [...] "a good idea" [...] for them to join the IWC. Some activists believe that Britain and its fellow EU old-timers such as France and Germany should recruit all member states into the Commission." [...] In Australia, National Nine News reported that [...] "New Zealand is questioning pro-whaling support among Pacific Island states with the opposition calling for a rethink of foreign aid." [...] It is expected that more countries in the future will join IWC including some landlocked countries. Currently, there are 8 landlocked IWC members. Mali and Mongolia voted with other pro-whaling countries. Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Switzerland and San Marino voted with other anti-whaling countries.|$|E

50|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} intended to be the third Conan film, Conan the Conqueror. The protagonist was changed due to Arnold Schwarzenegger's refusal to reprise his role as Conan and Kevin Sorbo's reluctance to redo a character already played.

The amount of conscientious work then done was most praiseworthy. But it was done almost without hope of success, and done chiefly as a matter of conscience. There was a feeling, which was not often expressed but which seemed to prevail everywhere, that ginger would not again be hot in the mouth, and that in very truth the time for cakes and ale in this world was all over.
