Following his divorce from his first wife, Anderson married Thamm in November 1960, while {{he was working on}} Four Feather Falls.|$|E
25|$|Anderson's first {{television}} production was the 1957 Roberta Leigh children's series The Adventures of <b>Twizzle.</b> Supercar (1961–62) and Fireball XL5 (1962) followed later, both series {{breaking into the}} US television market in the early 1960s. In the mid-1960s Anderson produced his most successful series, Thunderbirds. Other television productions of the 1960s include Stingray and Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons.|$|E
25|$|The Adventures of <b>Twizzle</b> was {{followed}} by another low-budget puppet series with Leigh, Torchy the Battery Boy (1958–1959). Although the APF puppet productions made the Andersons world-famous, Gerry Anderson was always unhappy about working with puppets. He used them primarily to get attention from and a good reputation with TV networks, hoping to have them serve as a stepping stone to his goal of making live-action film and TV drama.|$|E

25|$|AP Films' first {{television}} venture was produced for Granada Television. Created by Roberta Leigh, The Adventures of <b>Twizzle</b> (1957–1958) {{was a series}} for young children about a doll {{with the ability to}} 'twizzle' his arms and legs to greater lengths. It was Anderson's first work with puppets, and the start of his long and successful collaborations with puppeteer Christine Glanville, special effects technician Derek Meddings and composer/arranger Barry Gray. It was Anderson's desire to move into live-action television.|$|E
500|$|La Rivière also cites {{external}} influences that, in his view, {{did not work}} in favour of The Secret Service. He expounds on the continuing popularity of earlier Anderson puppet productions {{as far back as}} the pre-Supermarionation series The Adventures of <b>Twizzle</b> (1959), and the frequent repeat runs that they had on ATV throughout the 1960s: [...] "... as with anything that is phenomenally popular, the time must come when the audience is satiated and drifts away to something else." [...] Fryer suggests that the espionage theme may not have been attractive to potential foreign buyers, noting that the American spy series The Man from U.N.C.L.E. had been cancelled in 1968 and that the last episode of The Avengers had aired in the UK the following year. Fryer considers the production of [...] "a spy series just when the fad for the genre was waning" [...] was the biggest problem that faced The Secret Service in finding an audience. On the other hand, it is argued that, in light of the release of Century 21's Doppelgänger (1969), a live-action film that preceded UFO, the Supermarionation format had become outdated. Archer and Hearn express similar concerns about expectations for a new Supermarionation series in 1969, writing that Anderson and his colleagues had become [...] "a bit too successful" [...] in producing a winning format.|$|E
6000|$|But {{his love}} did not on that account wax cool, {{and so in}} his misery he had {{recourse}} to their mutual friend, Miss <b>Twizzle.</b> [...] "The truth is this," [...] said Miss <b>Twizzle,</b> [...] "I believe she'd take him, because he's respectable and got a business." ...|$|E

6000|$|It {{was some}} {{week or two}} after the deed of {{partnership}} had been signed, and when the house at No. 81 had been just taken, that Miss <b>Twizzle</b> came to Robinson. He was, at the moment, engaged in composition for an illustrious house in the Minories that shall be nameless; but he immediately gave his attention to Miss <b>Twizzle,</b> though {{at the moment he}} was combating the difficulties of a rhyme which it had been his duty to repeat nineteen times in the same poem.

6000|$|... "Oh, bother!" [...] said Miss <b>Twizzle.</b> [...] "I {{know nothing}} about that. He's got a business, and whoever marries Brisket won't {{have to look for}} a bed to sleep on. But there's a hitch about the money." ...|$|E

60|$|And he was there. When {{he entered}} Mr. Brown's sitting-room he found Maryanne and Miss <b>Twizzle,</b> but Miss Twizzle's future lord {{had not yet}} come. He did not wait for Mr. Brown to go to sleep, but at once {{declared}} the purpose of his visit.|$|E
60|$|But Brisket, {{even though}} he did not see his way, was open to female seduction. Why was it, that at this eventful period of Robinson's {{existence}} Mrs. Poppins should have turned against him? Why his old friend, Polly <b>Twizzle,</b> should have gone over to his rival, Robinson never knew. It may have been because, in his humble way, Poppins himself stood firmly by his friend; for such often is the nature of women. Be that as it may, Mrs. Poppins, who is now again his fast friend, was then his enemy.|$|E

60|$|There was at {{that time}} a music class held at a certain elegant room near Osnaburgh Church in the New Road, at which Maryanne and her friend Miss <b>Twizzle</b> were {{accustomed}} to attend. Those lessons were sometimes prosecuted in the evening, and those evening studies sometimes resulted in a little dance. We may say that after a while that was their habitual tendency, and that the lady pupils were permitted to introduce their male friends on condition that the gentlemen paid a shilling each for the privilege. It was in that room that George Robinson passed the happiest hours of his chequered existence. He was soon expert in all the figures of the mazy dance, and was excelled by no one in the agility of his step or the endurance of his performances. It was by degrees rumoured about that he was something higher than he seemed to be, and those best accustomed to the place used to call him the Poet. It must be remembered that at this time Mrs. McCockerell was still alive, and that as Sarah Jane had then become Mrs. Jones, Maryanne was her mother's favourite, and destined to receive all her mother's gifts. Of the name and person of William Brisket, George Robinson was then in happy ignorance, and the first introduction between them took place in the Hall of Harmony.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>twizzle</b> is a multirotational one-foot turn {{in figure}} skating. The <b>twizzle</b> is most {{commonly}} seen in ice dancing, where {{it appears in}} a number of Pattern Dances (originally called Compulsory Dance) and is a required element of step sequences in the short dance, original dance and free dance. [...] A <b>twizzle</b> is also common in synchronized skating where it is also a required element of step sequences.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>twizzle</b> {{differs from}} a figure skating spin {{in that it}} travels across the ice instead of being {{centered}} in one spot. Skaters can turn several revolutions on a <b>twizzle,</b> the number of which depends on {{the level at which}} they are skating or what is set in the specified steps of a Pattern Dance; as defined by the ISU Technical Committee of the relevant discipline.|$|E

5000|$|Step {{sequences}} may feature {{many different}} steps and turns, rotations in either direction, {{use of the}} upper body, and changes of rotational direction {{through the use of}} turns like rocker turns, counter turns, bracket turns, and <b>twizzles.</b> The steps may include mohawk turns and choctaw turns. There must be variety and complexity in the sequence to achieve a high level of difficulty.|$|R
25|$|The short dance merges the set {{pattern of}} a {{compulsory}} dance (renamed {{at the same}} time of this ruling to the pattern dance), and the previous rules of the original dance, i.e. requiring a set rhythm but allowing choreographic freedom within the constraints of required elements. In addition to skating two patterns, dancers also must include a step sequence, a set of <b>twizzles,</b> and a lift. Competitors are allowed to choose their own music, so long as it fits the required rhythm/theme.|$|R
