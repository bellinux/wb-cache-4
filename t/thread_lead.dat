In {{order to}} enhance design {{reliability}} of a co-rotating twin screw pulping extruder (TSPE), optimum design on screw {{parameters of the}} TSPE was studied based on the extrusion model. The maximum shear flux or the minimum power consumption, or the two synchronous optimizations were taken as objective functions, and constraint conditions, such as <b>thread</b> <b>lead,</b> depth of thread, screw rotational speed, number of reverse <b>thread</b> <b>lead,</b> actual top width of the flight, torsional strength and stiffness of the screw mandrel, and so on were confirmed base on actual requirements of the TSPE manufacture and application. The optimizing results show that two-objective optimum design results split the difference of the two single-objective optimum design, {{and it is the}} most economical in reducing manufacture cost of the equipment and pulping expenses...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} design {{trapezoidal}} thread parameters of co-rotating twin screw extruder {{that is used}} in non-fused materials processing, based on geometry of fully wiped co-rotating twin screw extruder by M.

Experiments show that a co-rotating twin screw pulping extruder of trapezoidal thread designed by the method is easier to machine and measure, and pulp processed by the twin screw pulping extruder can meet the quality requirements. Thus, twin screw designed by the method reserves the main strongpoint of the fully wiped co-rotating twin screw extruder...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study the loosening tendency of a threaded fastener. To achieve the objective, the threaded fastener looseness model is constructed through the following procedures. Firstly, static and dynamic threaded fastener models are derived to find the static and dynamic interior forces respectively. Secondly, for investigating the bolt loosening behaviour, the effects of <b>thread</b> <b>lead</b> angle, initial preload, vibration frequency, and the nature of material on the bolt looseness, the threaded fastener looseness model is constructed by combining the above models with a Karnopp frictional model. The proposed approach not only analyses both the static and the dynamic behaviours of the bolt as well as the bolt loosening but also detects whether the bolt is within the elastic range or not. The approach can serve as a guide for designing a thread fastening procedure to avoid the failure of threaded fasteners due to vibration...|$|E

40|$|Real-time upcalls (rtus) are an {{operating}} systems mechanism to provide quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees to network applications, and to efficiently implement protocols in user space with (QoS) guarantees. Traditionally, threads (and real-time extensions to threads) {{have been used}} to structure concurrent activities in user space protocol implementations. However, preemptive scheduling required for real-time <b>threads</b> <b>leads</b> to excessive context switching, and introduces the need for expensive concurrency control mechanisms such as locking. The rtu mechanism exploits the iterative nature of protocol processing to eliminate the need for locking, and reduce asynchronous preemption, while ensuring real-time operation.

At long times, {{the evolution of the}} viscoelastic thread deviates from self-similar exponential decay and competition of elastic, capillary and inertial forces leads to the formation of a periodic array of beads connected by axially-uniform ligaments.

According to one estimate, patients with ICDs have a 20 percent chance of lead failure within 10 years, and replacing the leads carries a risk of death of between two and five percent. Some device manufacturers have had to replace defective leads which exposed implanted individuals to unnecessary shocks or other malfunctions, in some cases possibly resulting in fatalities.|$|R

We show that this task is not nearly as simple as previously thought, at least if one is concerned about space safety. Programming with threads is common in domains such as networking, operating systems, and user interfaces.

40|$|The {{transient}} extensional rheology and {{the dynamics}} of elastocapillary thinning in aqueous solutions of polyethylene oxide (PEO) are studied with high-speed digital video microscopy. At long times, {{the evolution of the}} thread radius deviates from self-similar exponential decay and competition between elastic, capillary and inertial forces leads to the formation of a periodic array of beads connected by axially uniform ligaments. This configuration is unstable and successive instabilities propagate from the necks connecting the beads and ligaments. This iterated process results in multiple generations of beads developing along the string in general agreement with predictions of Chang et al. [Phys. Fluids, 11 (1999) 1717] although the experiments yield a different recursion relation between the successive generations of beads. At long times, finite extensibility truncates the iterated instability, and slow axial translation of the bead arrays along the interconnecting <b>threads</b> <b>leads</b> to progressive coalescence before the ultimate rupture of the fluid column. Despite these dynamical complexities it is still possible to measure the steady growth in the transient extensional viscosity by monitoring the slow capillary-driven thinning in the cylindrical ligaments between beads...|$|R

However, the pinch-off dynamics leading to blood-drop-breakup is elusively more complex than what may be portrayed by any unique model depicting the underlying morpho-dynamics, as our study reveals.

One mode corresponds to incessant collapsing of a liquid-neck, while in other mode formation and thinning of an extended long <b>thread</b> <b>leads</b> to the breakup and drop formation.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2017 Sourdough is a {{fermented}} {{mixture of}} flour and water used {{around the world}} to leaven dough. In this doughy world wide web of sourdough, one <b>thread</b> <b>leads</b> to Alaska and the Yukon Territory. Commonly associated with the gold rush era, sourdough is known both as a pioneer food and as a title for a long-time resident. Less well known is the live culture of microbes, yeasts and bacteria that were responsible for creating the ferment for nutritious bread, pancakes, and biscuits on the trail. Through the lens of sourdough, this study investigates the intersection of microbes and human culture: how microbes contribute taste and texture to baked goods; why sourdough, made from imported ingredients, became a traditional food in the North; and how "Sourdough" grew to signify an experienced northerner. A review of research about sourdough microflora, coupled with excerpts from archival sources, illuminates how human and microbial cultures intertwined to make sourdough an everyday food in isolated communities and mining camps. Mastery of sourdough starter in primitive kitchens with fluctuating temperatures became a mark of accomplishment. Meanwhile, as transient fortune seekers ushered in the gold rush era, experienced Sourdoughs continued to take pride in a common identity based on shared experiences unique to northern living...|$|R

40|$|The {{role of the}} Holy Spirit is {{much more}} in the centre of spirituality of the Eastern Church than {{is the case in}} the Western Church. Nevertheless, to say that Orthodox thought has finally and fully {{developed}} systematic theology of the Holy Spirit, would be excessive.
