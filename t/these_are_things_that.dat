500|$|Webb felt a {{responsibility}} to reinvent Spider-Man. One departure from the preceding trilogy was to have Spider-Man build artificial web-shooters, as the character does in the comics. In February 2011, with {{the launch of the}} official website, the title and first official image of Garfield as Spider-Man depicting both his costume and web-shooters for the first time were revealed. Writer Geoff Boucher of the Los Angeles Times was skeptical of the change, feeling that it was too hard to believe that a financially strapped young man could conceive a wrist-worn device that can instantly produce a strand of synthetic webbing and [...] noted [...] "the suit lives up to the challenge of being different from the Sam Raimi films but not too different from the classic suit that stands {{as one of the great}} comic-book costumes ever." [...] Matt Goldberg of Collider admitted that he was not crazy about the costume, explaining that the bug-yellow eyes felt weird to him and the mesh-pattern felt too busy. He explained that the design of the gloves caused flashbacks to the Spider-Man 2099 costume which he did not like, although he felt that the web-shooters looked fine. Webb explained that he felt that [...] "the web-shooters were able to dramatize Peter's intellect". Webb paid attention to the question of [...] "How would a kid make it?" [...] and then took some license with it. About the new costume, Webb explained that he and the crew [...] "wanted a design that would make the body longer and more lithe, more of an acrobat, someone incredibly agile and the legs of the spider [...] were something we used to emphasize that." [...] He revealed that the film used varying suits for different lighting conditions. They made the webbing on the costume a little darker. Webb stated that [...] "With the costume and the web-shooters we wanted to emphasize that <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> Peter Parker made". Webb also looked at the Mark Bagley art in Ultimate Spider-Man for the hero's body.|$|E
2500|$|Del Toro {{has said}} the film has strong {{connections}} in theme to The Devil's Backbone and {{should be seen as}} an informal sequel dealing with some of the issues raised there. Fernando Tielve and Íñigo Garcés, who played the protagonists of The Devil's Backbone, make cameo appearances as unnamed guerrilla soldiers in Pan's Labyrinth. Some of the other works he drew on for inspiration include Lewis Carroll's Alice books, Jorge Luis Borges' Ficciones, Arthur Machen's The Great God Pan and The White People, Lord Dunsany's The Blessing of Pan, Algernon Blackwood's Pan's Garden and Francisco Goya's works. In 2004, del Toro said: [...] "Pan is an original story. Some of my favourite writers (Borges, Blackwood, Machen, Dunsany) have explored the figure of the god Pan and the symbol of the labyrinth. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I find very compelling and I am trying to mix them and play with them."

60|$|But I {{do want to}} {{tell you}} certain things. I {{want to tell you}} them because they are things that affect you closely. There was almost from the first a {{difference}} between Mary and myself in this, that I wanted to be public about our love, I wanted to be open and defiant, and she--hesitated. She wanted to be secret. She wanted to keep me; I sometimes think that she was moved to become my mistress because she wanted to keep me. But she also wanted to keep everything else in her life,--her position, her ample freedoms and wealth and dignity. Our love was to be a secret cavern, Endymion's cave. I was ready enough to do what I could to please her, and for a time I served that secrecy, lied, pretended, agreed to false addresses, assumed names, and tangled myself in a net-work of furtive proceedings. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> poison and consume honest love.|$|E
60|$|It is {{practically}} impossible for two equally valid sets of reasons. The {{first is that}} under existing conditions, saving and investment constitute {{the only way to}} rest and security in old age, to leisure, study and intellectual independence, to the safe upbringing of a family and the happiness of one's weaker dependents. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> should not be left for the individual to provide; in the civilized state, the state itself will insure every citizen against these anxieties that now make the study of the City Article almost a duty. To abandon saving and investment to-day, and to do so is of course to abandon all insurance, is to become a driven and uncertain worker, to risk one's personal freedom and culture and the upbringing and efficiency of one's children. It is to lower the standard of one's personal civilization, to think with less deliberation and less detachment, to fall away from that work of accumulating fine habits and beautiful and pleasant ways of living contributory to the coming State. And in the second place there is not only no return for such a sacrifice in anything won for Socialism, but for fine-thinking and living people to give up property is merely to let it pass into the hands of more egoistic possessors. Since at present things must be privately owned, it is better that they should be owned by people consciously working for social development and willing to use them to that end.|$|E

Equally criticised were the prince's sleep-walking and the trick played by the Elector. This <b>was</b> because although <b>these</b> <b>were</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> acceptable in comedy, they offended the rules governing the portrayed behaviour of the aristocratic figures of tragedy.

60|$|Two cigars {{a day at}} ninepence apiece come to £27 7s. 6d. yearly, {{and four}} ounces of tobacco a week at nine shillings a pound come to £5 17s. yearly. That makes £33 4s. 6d. When we {{calculate}} the yearly expense of tobacco in this way, we are naturally taken aback, and our extravagance shocks us more after we have considered how much more satisfactorily the money might have been spent. With £33 4s. 6d. you can buy new Oriental rugs for the drawing-room, {{as well as a}} spring bonnet and a nice dress. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> give permanent pleasure, whereas you have no interest in a cigar after flinging away the stump. Judging by myself, I should say that it was want of thought rather than selfishness that makes heavy smokers of so many bachelors. Once a man marries, his eyes are opened to many things that he was quite unaware of previously, among them being the delight of adding an article of furniture to the drawing-room every month, and having a bedroom in pink and gold, the door of which is always kept locked. If men would only consider that every cigar they smoke would buy part of a new piano-stool in terra-cotta plush, and that for every pound tin of tobacco purchased away goes a vase for growing dead geraniums in, they would surely hesitate. They do not consider, however, until they marry, and then they are forced to it. For my own part, I fail to see why bachelors should be allowed to smoke as much as they like, when we are debarred from it.|$|E

60|$|Some may say, Will God {{see that}} which is not? and will he judge a man just that is a sinner? But I will answer, The man that had the rainbow about his head, was to look on, or be looked upon, while he shone like a jasper and a sardix-stone (Rev 4:3). The blood of the paschal lamb was to be looked upon by him that came to destroy the land of Egypt in their firstborn (Exo 12:13). I add, The rainbow that God gave to Noah for a token that he would no more destroy the earth with {{the waters of the}} flood, was to be looked upon, that God might {{remember}} to show mercy to his people (Gen 9:8-17). Now all these meet in the man Christ Jesus, who is the only one, for the sake of whom the sinner that believeth in him stands acquitted in the sight of God. His is the blood, he is the prince, that is more than the token of the covenant: nor do all the colours in the rainbow appear so beautiful in the eyes of man, as does the garment of Christ; which is from his loins, even upward, and from his loins, even downward, {{in the eyes of the}} God of heaven (Eze 1:27,28). And wilt thou say <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are not? Also, he can legally judge a man just, that is a sinner. Do but admit of a diverse consideration, and God will so consider of that sinner which he justifieth, in despite of all the teeth in thy proud mouth! 'He justifieth the ungodly' (Rom 4:5). Not that were, but that are such now, in the judgment and verdict of the law, might deal with them in their own persons as men (Rom 5:5-10). He will then consider them in his Son; in, and under the skirt of his Son. He will consider them as washed in the blood of his Son, and will also consider 'that in him is no sin,' and so he will deal with them. 'We know that he was manifested to take away our sins, and in him is no sin' (1 John 3:5).|$|E
