5|$|In this context, the League of Nations {{was also}} the {{institution}} where the first international debate on terrorism took place following the 1934 assassination of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia in Marseille, showing its conspiratorial features, {{many of which are}} detectable in <b>the</b> <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> terrorism among states after 9/11.|$|E
5|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also {{critique}} <b>the</b> <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> sensibility, a {{moral philosophy}} and aesthetic {{that had become}} popular {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century. Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.|$|E
5|$|In her {{treatment}} of the novel, María Regina Ruiz claims that power gives its wielder {{the ability to make}} prohibitions; prohibitions that are reflected in history, the study of which reveals what is and what is not told. The government's actions in The Feast of the Goat demonstrate <b>the</b> <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> prohibition: foreign newspapers and magazines were prohibited from entering Trujillo's country as they were seen {{as a threat to the}} government's ideas. Mario Vargas Llosa takes part in this discourse by recounting what was prohibited.|$|E

5|$|The {{movement}} for indigenous {{cultural and political}} resurgence in Taiwan traces its roots to the ideals outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948). Although the Republic of China was a UN member and signatory to the original UN Charter, four decades of martial law controlled <b>the</b> <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> culture and politics on Taiwan. The political liberalization Taiwan experienced {{leading up to the}} official end of martial law on July 15, 1987, opened a new public arena for dissenting voices and political movements against the centralized policy of the KMT.|$|E
5|$|Sensibility in {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century was {{considered}} both a physical and a moral phenomenon. Physicians and anatomists believed that the more sensitive people's nerves, the more emotionally affected they would be by their surroundings. Since women were thought to have keener nerves than men, it was also believed that women were more emotional than men. The emotional excess associated with sensibility also theoretically produced an ethic of compassion: those with sensibility could easily sympathize with people in pain. Thus historians have credited <b>the</b> <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> sensibility and those who promoted it with the increased humanitarian efforts, such as the movement to abolish the slave trade, of the eighteenth century. But sensibility was also thought to paralyze those who had too much of it; they were weakened by constant vicarious suffering.|$|E

25|$|Lastly, {{the sexual}} {{education}} perspective of <b>the</b> <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> desire {{is very rare}} in U.S. high schools.

25|$|In 1847, the American Medical Association adopted {{its first}} code of ethics, with this being based {{in large part}} upon Percival's work. While the secularized field {{borrowed}} largely from Catholic medical ethics, in the 20th century a distinctively liberal Protestant approach was articulated by thinkers such as Joseph Fletcher. In the 1960s and 1970s, building upon liberal theory and procedural justice, much of <b>the</b> <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> medical ethics went through a dramatic shift and largely reconfigured itself into bioethics.|$|E

25|$|Status Planning {{suggests}} that a particular language or variety may be chosen for specific purposes and given official status. This {{may result in a}} language policy which is a product of language planning, and can be comprehended within <b>the</b> <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> language politics and society, or the more informal but powerful political and social aspects of language planning. In this view, one can argue that language status planning issues are related to political issues as status planning focuses on legislative decisions that affect the reallocation of language functions. Language status can also mean the position or standing of a language vis-à-vis other languages.|$|E
25|$|The {{aftermath}} of the uprising established the leading role of the ANC in the anti-apartheid struggle, {{as it was the}} body best able to channel and organise students seeking the end of apartheid. So, although the BCM's ideas had been important in creating the climate that gave the students the confidence to strike out, it was the ANC's non-racialism which came to dominate <b>the</b> <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> the anti-apartheid movement amongst blacks. The perspectives set out in Joe Slovo's essay No Middle Road – written at just this time and predicting the apartheid government had only the choice between more repression and overthrow by the revolutionaries – were highly influential.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{being able}} to {{function}} within a Discourse may carry advantages in different situations. For example, {{if a person is}} raised in a family of lawyers, the Discourses of politics or business may come very easily to that person. In the United States, those are all Discourses of power and they are closely related. Another person raised in a very different Discourse community might find himself or herself at a disadvantage when trying to move within <b>the</b> <b>Discourse</b> <b>of</b> business, trying to get a loan, for instance. One Discourse community is not inherently better than another; however, power within a society may be unequally represented within different Discourses.|$|E

40|$|There {{is a broad}} {{literature}} on Turkey's Kurdish Question and its European Union (EU) accession process. However, these studies mostly do not {{speak to each other}} nor do they link international actors with those of the domestic. To fill this gap, in particular, this study focuses on the impact of the European Union accession process on Turkey's Kurdish Conflict during the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government and <b>the</b> <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domestic political actors to <b>the</b> requests and <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> an international actor, namely the EU. Building on the effects of EU reforms on the Kurdish Question, this study argues that in addition to the actual progress that is reflected through the EU reforms in Turkey, the impact of the accession process is visible in <b>the</b> <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> political party leaders. Through analyzing <b>the</b> political <b>discourses</b> in Turkey between 2002 and 2010, this study demonstrates how the EU reforms that affect the Kurdish Question are reflected in <b>the</b> political <b>discourses</b> in Turkey and what affects the changes in <b>the</b> <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> actors along with the variation over time...|$|R
