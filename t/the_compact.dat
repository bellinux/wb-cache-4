In this study, two {{different}} starting compositions were prepared {{according to two}} cation values, and then <b>the</b> mixture was <b>compacted</b> uniaxially in a die and <b>the</b> green <b>compacts</b> were subjected to cold isostatic pressing. They were sintered at 1700 ºC and 1750 ºC for 30 and 120 min under nitrogen atmosphere. <b>The</b> sintered <b>compacts</b> were analyzed for hardness, densification phase and microstructure. <b>The</b> <b>compacts</b> were analyzed using X-Ray, SEM-EDS techniques.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Subsoiling {{is often}} {{required}} to alleviate soil compaction; however, deep tillage {{can be expensive}} and time-consuming. If this tillage operation is conducted deeper than <b>the</b> <b>compacted</b> soil layer, energy is wasted. However, if this tillage operation is conducted shallower than <b>the</b> <b>compacted</b> soil layer, energy is again wasted, and plant roots may be prevented from penetrating <b>the</b> <b>compacted</b> layer. Technologies are now available that allow subsoiling to be conducted at the specific depth of <b>the</b> <b>compacted</b> layer, which would conserve natural resources without sacrificing crop yields. An experiment was conducted over four years in a field located in southern Alabama to evaluate whether the concept of site-specific subsoiling (tilling just deep enough to eliminate the hardpan layer) would reduce tillage draft and energy requirements and/or reduce crop yields. Average corn (Zea mays L.) yields over this four-year period showed that site-specific subsoiling produced yields equivalent to those produced by the uniform deep subsoiling treatment while reducing draft forces, drawbar power, and fuel use...|$|R

5|$|A few {{hydroxyl}} megamasers, including Arp 220, {{have been}} observed with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), which allows sources to be studied at higher angular resolution. VLBI observations indicate that hydroxyl megamaser emission is composed of two components, one diffuse and one compact. The diffuse component displays gains of less than a factor of one and linewidths of order hundreds of kilometers per second. These characteristics {{are similar to those}} seen with single dish observations of hydroxyl megamasers that are unable to resolve individual masing components. <b>The</b> <b>compact</b> components have high gains, ranging from tens to hundreds,high ratios of flux at 1667MHz to flux at 1665MHz, and linewidths are of order a few kilometers per second. These general features have been explained by a narrow circumnuclear ring of material from which the diffuse emission arises, and individual masing clouds with sizes of order one parsec that give rise to <b>the</b> <b>compact</b> emission. The hydroxyl masers observed in the Milky Way more closely resemble <b>the</b> <b>compact</b> hydroxyl megamaser components.

Either formulation would help the Democratic-Republican cause by refuting the finality of any constitutional interpretation advanced by the Congress and federal judiciary, both of which were dominated by Federalists.|$|E

40|$|Imperial Users onlyThis Thesis {{describes}} {{a study of}} the compaction and the sintering of ceramic powders within the context of their "near net shape forming" into dense bodies. The operation of near net shape forming is the manufacture of ceramic parts with a required external dimensional tolerance combined with a defect free internal microstructure. The current study considers these requirements by focusing upon the fundamental facets of near net shape forming operations. The effects of the processing and material parameters on the compaction behaviour of agglomerated alumina powders have been investigated experimentally. It has been shown that <b>the</b> green <b>compacts,</b> formed from <b>the</b> agglomerated alumina powders by the uniaxial die pressing technique, possess certain density distribution patterns due to the frictional forces during the compaction process, and these density distributions depend primarily upon the properties of the agglomerates and the lubrication state of the die wall. The density distributions in <b>the</b> green <b>compacts</b> have been determined experimentally using the coloured layer technique and predicted using a first order model. Due to the inhomogeneous density distributions in <b>the</b> green <b>compacts,</b> <b>the</b> shrinkage of <b>the</b> <b>compacts</b> was not homogeneous. As a result, the shapes of <b>the</b> sintered <b>compacts</b> were not geometrically linear scaled replicas of <b>the</b> green <b>compacts</b> and <b>the</b> shape distortions in <b>the</b> sintered <b>compacts</b> have been characterised. It has been shown that there is a relationship between the extent of the shape distortions and the density distributions in the green compacts; that is, the more inhomogeneous green <b>compacts</b> <b>the</b> more is the shape distortions in <b>the</b> resulting sintered <b>compacts.</b> Sintering and grain growth equations, modified from established relationships, have been used for the sintering simulations in order to predict both the progression of the density and grain size of <b>the</b> sintered <b>compacts.</b> In order to predict the overall shape of <b>the</b> sintered <b>compacts,</b> a first order model has been developed by combining the predicted density distributions in <b>the</b> green <b>compacts</b> and <b>the</b> predicted density of <b>the</b> sintered <b>compacts.</b> <b>The</b> extent of the shape distortions have been reduced by optimising the properties of the agglomerates and the state of the die wall lubrication condition...|$|R

Copper powder particles were compressed inside a cylindrical die cavity with 2 mm diameter to form compacts with about 3 mm height.

However, by increasing the forming temperature to 400 °C, ductile deformations have been observed on <b>the</b> <b>compacts</b> of dendritic particles. Furthermore, the sintering treatment resulted in increases in dimensions, decreases in relative density and hardness, and an increase in ductility.
