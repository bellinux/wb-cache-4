5|$|The {{transmission}} of the T-26 consisted of single-disc main dry clutch, a gearbox with five gears in the front part of the vehicle, steering clutches, final drives and band brakes. <b>The</b> <b>gearbox</b> {{was connected to the}} engine by a drive shaft passing through the vehicle. A gear change lever was mounted directly on <b>the</b> <b>gearbox.</b>|$|E
5|$|The car used {{a revised}} and lighter {{version of the}} 6-speed gearbox {{designed}} for the BT45B. Brabham designed <b>the</b> <b>gearbox</b> casing, which was cast by Alfa Romeo and used Hewland gears.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge for}} this series was achieving ground clearance for the wing-mounted engine. This {{was overcome by}} reducing the intake fan diameter and relocating <b>the</b> <b>gearbox</b> and other accessories from beneath the engine to the sides. The resulting flattened nacelle bottom and intake lip yielded the distinctive appearance of the Boeing737 with CFM56 engines.|$|E
50|$|The name Self-Changing Gears is {{sometimes}} confusing: <b>the</b> <b>gearboxes</b> {{are not fully}} automatic, selection of gear ratio remains a manual choice, but the gear-changing and any clutch control needed is automated. <b>The</b> <b>gearboxes</b> were {{used in conjunction with}} a fluid coupling so no clutch pedal was needed.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> FS5W71C <b>gearboxes</b> had {{different}} ratios {{to all other}} S13/S14. A key change was the layshaft gear which changed from 22/31 to 21/32, thus running the layshaft slower and at higher torque. This gearbox is considered weaker than other S13/S14 <b>gearboxes.</b> <b>The</b> front of <b>the</b> SR20DET <b>gearbox</b> with bell housing can be removed and a CA18DET bell housing fitted to allow <b>the</b> <b>gearboxes</b> to be swapped.|$|R
50|$|The yacht {{can achieve}} {{a speed of}} 13 kn on just one engine. A cooling pump {{integrated}} into <b>the</b> <b>gearboxes</b> assures safe operation on one engine by pumping oil through <b>the</b> idle <b>gearbox.</b> <b>The</b> shaft of the idle engine can be disengaged, leaving the idle propeller and shaft to freewheel.|$|R
5|$|The rebuilt Lamborghini of JLOC Isao Noritake was {{the first}} {{retirement}} of the race when <b>the</b> <b>gearbox</b> failed on the Mulsanne during its second lap of the race. Shortly after the first hour of the race had been completed, heavy rain resulted in the safety car being brought out again.|$|E
5|$|FF Developments, in {{addition}} to their design work on <b>the</b> <b>gearbox</b> and rear axle assembly were given responsibility for their manufacture. The aluminium chassis components and body panels were manufactured and assembled at Abbey Panels factory in Coventry, before the body in white was delivered to the assembly plant at Bloxham. The car, including chassis and body components, consists of approximately 3000 unique parts.|$|E
5|$|A BT49B {{specification}} appeared {{early in}} the 1980 season; it was conceived around a new transverse gearbox designed by American gearbox specialist Pete Weismann. The new unit could be fitted with five or six gears and was tall and narrow, allowing a clearer airflow from under {{the car to the}} rear, with the intent of improving the ground effect. An alternative rear suspension layout was designed to go with this gearbox. It replaced the standard pullrods with rocker arms that activated vertical coil springs mounted behind <b>the</b> <b>gearbox.</b> The Weismann unit proved difficult to make reliable and was used alongside the original gearbox, mainly on a spare chassis, until the Dutch Grand Prix, after which it was put to one side.|$|E
50|$|At <b>the</b> {{beginning}} <b>the</b> <b>gearboxes</b> {{were produced}} by ZF, after this by a domestic producer Rosenlew. Later gearboxes were produced in Valmet Rautpohja factory; this type was copied from <b>the</b> American Fuller <b>gearboxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> manual <b>gearbox,</b> <b>the</b> {{first of}} the type used by Daimler since they started using the {{pre-selector}} type across their range in the 1930s, was reverse-engineered from <b>the</b> Standard <b>gearbox</b> used in <b>the</b> Triumph TR3A.|$|R
50|$|The 6HP32 is a {{variation}} of the 6HP26 for high-output applications. <b>The</b> <b>gearbox's</b> maximum input torque is 750 Nm.|$|R
5|$|In 2006, Lexus {{incorporated}} the first production eight-speed automatic transmission {{in an automobile}} with the LS 460, and <b>the</b> <b>gearbox</b> was later adapted for the GS 460 and IS F models. Continuously variable transmissions, regenerative brakes, and electric motors have been used on all Lexus hybrid models. In 2007, Lexus executives signaled intentions to equip further models with hybrid powertrains, catering to demands for a decrease in both carbon pollution and oil reliance. Hybrid models have been differentiated by separate badging and lighting technology; in 2008, the LS 600h L became the first production vehicle to use LED headlamps.|$|E
5|$|On 15 May 2003, AgustaWestland {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with Bell Helicopter to undertake final assembly of the US101 in the U.S. Under the pact, AgustaWestland would produce the main rotor blades and main fuselage sections at its Yeovil, UK, facility. The company would also manufacture other components, including <b>the</b> <b>gearbox,</b> at its Cascina Costa, Italy facility; this represents a work share of 36 per cent. The remaining 64 per cent work share was split between Lockheed Martin (31 per cent) and Bell Helicopter (27 per cent) and other firms (6 per cent).|$|E
5|$|Some teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the Grand Prix. Williams, Jaguar, Ferrari, Sauber and Prost all brought updated front wings. Ferrari also introduced a new underfloor and brought more powerful versions of their V10 engines for qualifying and the race. Williams installed extra cooling on their cars to combat high temperatures in qualifying. Minardi planned to introduce a new revision to their cars aerodynamic package which included a new engine cover, a titanium gearbox and rear suspension geometry. The team decided to only test <b>the</b> <b>gearbox</b> during the first free practice session.|$|E
50|$|Future work {{includes}} {{overhaul of}} the two traction motors, some attention to one of <b>the</b> <b>gearboxes</b> and re-cabling prior to reassembly.|$|R

5|$|The BT19 was {{initially}} {{fitted with a}} Hewland HD (Heavy Duty) gearbox, originally designed for use with less powerful 2-litre engines. The greater power of the 3-litre Repco engine was more than <b>the</b> <b>gearbox</b> could reliably transmit when accelerating at full power from rest, {{with the result that}} Brabham normally made very gentle starts to avoid gearbox breakages. The HD was later replaced with the sturdier DG (Different Gearbox) design, produced at the request of both Brabham and Dan Gurney's Anglo American Racers team. It later became a popular choice for other constructors.|$|E
5|$|The work {{split between}} the two {{companies}} gave GE responsibility for the high-pressure compressor (HPC), the combustor, and the high-pressure turbine (HPT); SNECMA {{was responsible for the}} fan, the low-pressure compressor (LPC), and the low-pressure turbine (LPT). SNECMA was also responsible for the initial airframe integration engineering, mostly involving the nacelle design, and was initially responsible for <b>the</b> <b>gearbox,</b> but shifted that work to GE when it became apparent that it would be more efficient for GE to assemble that component along with their other parts.|$|E
5|$|While {{performing}} a test run prior to the park opening on July 9, 2013, one of the roller coaster trains became stuck {{near the top of}} the lift hill. The train was eventually brought down a week later, and the ride remained closed for more than two months. Kings Dominion later explained the closure through a statement released on their official Facebook page on August 28, 2013, which stated that a problem with the weight distribution on <b>the</b> <b>gearbox</b> caused a part to warp and fail. The replacement part had to be custom-built in another country, causing the extended closure. The ride eventually reopened on September 14, 2013.|$|E

40|$|The {{preliminary}} design of advanced technology (1992) turboprop engines for single-rotation prop-fans and conceptual designs of pitch change mechanisms for single- and counter-rotation prop-fan application are discussed. <b>The</b> single-rotation <b>gearbox</b> is a split path, in-line configuration. <b>The</b> counter-rotation <b>gearbox</b> is an in-line, differential planetary design. The pitch change mechanisms {{for both the}} single- and counter-rotation arrangements are rotary/hydraulic. The advanced technology single-rotation gearbox yields a 2. 4 percent improvement in aircraft fuel burn and a one percent improvement in operating cost relative to a current technology <b>gearbox.</b> <b>The</b> 1992 counter-rotation <b>gearbox</b> is 15 percent lighter, 15 percent more reliable, 5 percent lower in cost, and 45 percent lower in maintenance cost than <b>the</b> 1992 single-rotation <b>gearbox.</b> <b>The</b> pitch controls are modular, accessible, and external...|$|R
5|$|In {{the third}} session on Saturday, Sebastian Vettel set the fastest time, at 1:07.098, {{a little over}} a tenth of a second ahead of his {{teammate}} Räikkönen. Rosberg had the slowest time of the session, as he crashed out when his suspension broke after going over the kerbs at turn 2. His accident caused a ten-minute red flag period. His teammate Hamilton was third fastest, albeit running wide at turn 8 on one of his laps. Ricciardo was fourth fastest, half a second down on Vettel and one tenth of a second ahead of teammate Verstappen in fifth. Fernando Alonso, who lost parts of his bodywork when running over the kerbs late in the session, was tenth fastest, 1.2 seconds behind Vettel. Due to his crash, Mercedes had to change <b>the</b> <b>gearbox</b> on Rosberg's car, handing him a five-place grid penalty.|$|E
5|$|In third {{practice}} on Saturday morning, Hamilton narrowly beat Rosberg to the fastest time, lapping just 0.068 seconds faster than his teammate. All drivers used the super-soft tyre compound {{to set their}} fastest lap times, with the two Ferrari cars of Vettel and Räikkönen third and fourth ahead of the Williams pair of Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas. Vettel {{had spent most of}} the session testing his car with a heavier fuel load in preparation for the race that would see him start with a five-place grid penalty for a change of <b>the</b> <b>gearbox.</b> He completed the highest number of laps with 28, ahead of Daniel Ricciardo, who was 11th fastest. At the back end, the Sauber drivers of Ericsson and Nasr were slowest, behind both Manor cars.|$|E
5|$|The chassis of the C5 {{consists}} of two identical metal pressings which are joined at top and bottom with a closing plate at the rear. It lacks a separate suspension system, instead relying on the chassis structure having enough torsional flex. Its motor was produced in Italy by Polymotor, {{a subsidiary of the}} Dutch company Philips. Although it was later famously said that the C5 was powered by a washing machine motor, the motor was in fact developed from a design produced to drive a truck cooling fan. Lotus provided <b>the</b> <b>gearbox</b> and a rear axle based on a design for car steering columns. The C5's electronics were produced by MetaLab, a Sinclair spin-off. The wheels were assembled from tyres made in Taiwan and wheels from Italy. Oldham Batteries provided a lead-acid battery developed for Sinclair that could manage more than the 300 charge-discharge cycles that had originally been specified.|$|E
50|$|M90 is {{the model}} {{designation}} for an automotive rear-wheel drive gearbox that was introduced in mid-1994 Volvo 940/960.The M90 RWD <b>gearbox</b> and <b>the</b> M56 FWD <b>gearbox</b> {{are considered to be}} brother and sister because they are built on <b>the</b> same <b>gearbox</b> platform and have many parts in common. All turbocars have <b>the</b> M90 <b>gearbox</b> as standard from 1995.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{standard}} <b>gearbox</b> {{was also}} available {{with an additional}} intermediate <b>gearbox.</b> <b>The</b> intermediate <b>gearbox</b> simply doubles <b>the</b> amount of gears, resulting in 2 × 6 forward and 2 × 2 reverse gears. Its gear lever has the three positions ″main gearbox″, ″intermediate gearbox″ and neutral. In addition to <b>the</b> additional intermediate <b>gearbox,</b> Daimler-Benz also offered a crawler-gearbox. The crawler-gearbox {{can be used with}} the first and second gear of every group of <b>the</b> main <b>gearbox,</b> it has two crawler gears, ″crawler″ and ″super crawler″, a neutral position and a ″main gearbox″ position. When in main gearbox position, all main gearbox gears can be used. This results in 2 × 6 + 2 × 4 forward and 2 × 2 + 2 × 2 reverse gears.|$|R

5|$|For 1966 the Formula One engine {{capacity}} limit was increased to 3.0 litres from the 1.5 litres {{of the previous}} five seasons. McLaren considered and discounted British Racing Motors (BRM), Maserati, Coventry Climax and Oldsmobile engines before opting for a Ford V8 engine. This engine was originally designed for the Indianapolis 500, the premier single-seater oval track race in the United States, {{and had to be}} reduced in capacity from 4.2 litres to the 3.0 litre limit. This choice was partly motivated by the belief that it might bring financial support from Ford, although this never materialised. Ex BMW and Daimler-Benz engineer Klaus von Rucker was initially appointed to carry out the conversion of the engine in England. However, progress was slow so the project was transferred to Traco Engineering in California, United States, where extensive modifications were made to the internals under the oversight of McLaren's Gary Knutson. In its 4.2 litre form the Ford engine produced 470bhp and McLaren expected the reduced capacity version to produce about 335bhp. In fact, it produced 300bhp in a narrow power band and was further handicapped by its large size and weight; combined with <b>the</b> <b>gearbox</b> it weighed nearly as much as rival team Brabham's entire car. In order to allow time to further develop the Ford, McLaren also used a Serenissima M166 3.0 litre V8 engine for some of the races. This engine produced about 260bhp and required modifications to be made to the monocoque but was at least relatively light and compact. Four- and five-speed ZF transaxle gearboxes and a Borg & Beck clutch were employed.|$|E
5|$|The No. 9 Audi {{began to}} fall off the race pace after {{multiple}} visits to the garage for repairs to its hybrid system, but the No. 7 Audi kept fighting as Lotterer reset the fastest lap of the race with a three minutes and 17.476 seconds time. KCMG had an anxious moment when Lapierre missed the Indianapolis corner, but recovered with marshal assistance without losing the LMP2 class lead. The No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari slowed on course {{and came to the}} garage with gearbox issues, handing the LMGTE Pro lead back to Corvette and allowing the No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari to climb to second place after recovering from its earlier issues. Vanthoor drove his car into his pitbox with gearbox problems but his team were unable to repair it before the race's conclusion and retired. Jann Mardenborough's Nissan came to a halt at the Porsche Curves after smoke bellowed out of {{the front of the car}} as <b>the</b> <b>gearbox</b> failed, leaving Nissan with a single car left circulating. Light rain {{began to fall}} on portions of the circuit in the final hour, but it was not heavy enough to affect the race. Dalla Lana, having led the previous 125 laps in LMGTE Am and within forty five minutes of the race finish, went straight on at the Ford Chicane and crashed heavily into an outside tyre barrier, ending the car's run and promoting the SMP Ferrari to the class lead which it held to the finish. Dalla Lana was unhurt.|$|E
5|$|Schumacher was {{the fastest}} driver not {{to advance to}} the final session, {{qualifying}} eleventh; his best time of 1:15.026 was nearly two seconds slower than Alonso's fastest time in the second session. He had been one tenth of a second quicker than his teammate Rosberg in the first session; Rosberg's lap caused Schumacher to be eliminated from qualifying and the latter stated he had brake problems. Kamui Kobayashi qualified in 12th after he encountered slower cars which forced him to reduce his speed, and his tyre temperatures dropped which resulted in a loss of grip. He was followed by Petrov in the 13th position. Sutil was afflicted with a lack of grip in his Force India which caused him to slide sideways. However Sutil was penalised five positions because this team changed his gearbox following his driveshaft failure in the final practice session. As a result, de la Rosa inherited 14th, and was ahead of the Toro Rosso drivers (Jaime Alguersuari in front of Buemi). Jarno Trulli was the quickest driver who was unable to advance beyond the first part of qualifying, and was followed by his Lotus teammate Heikki Kovalainen. Timo Glock was penalised five positions on the grid twice because his team changed his gearbox and fitted a seventh-gear ratio that went undeclared on Friday. Senna took over the 20th place. Liuzzi exited turn 15 to complete his second timed lap, ran over a wet patch of astroturf causing him to lose control of the back-end of his Force India, sending him across the track to make heavy contact with the front of his car. He veered back towards the track and some grass and narrowly avoided collecting Glock. Sakon Yamamoto had a shifting issue on his fastest lap time and took 23rd. Lucas di Grassi had a gearbox problem in his car that was unable to be rectified and completed the field. He was later given a five-place grid penalty for <b>the</b> <b>gearbox</b> change but it had no effect on his starting position.|$|E
