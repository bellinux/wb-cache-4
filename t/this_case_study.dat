25|$|Comprehension is {{severely}} affected {{in patients with}} Wernicke’s aphasia. Wernicke’s area has been {{thought to be the}} center of language processing, specifically processing of meaning. While patients are still left with some comprehension, they are not able to repeat a sentence spoken to them or participate in an action requested by another speaker. A case study done by Ellis et al. discussed a patient who underwent several types of testing, one of which was a word-picture test. The conclusion of the test showed that while the patient understood what the image was, he had trouble retrieving the word and understanding the instructions. <b>This</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> suggests that it is language comprehension that is affected in Wernicke's aphasia and not a drop in intelligence.|$|E
25|$|Patient R.B. was a {{normally}} functioning man {{until the}} age of 52. At age 50, he had been diagnosed with angina and had surgery for heart problems on two occasions. After an ischemic episode (reduction of blood to the brain) that was caused from a heart bypass surgery, R.B. demonstrated a loss of anterograde memory, but almost no loss of retrograde memory, {{with the exception of a}} couple of years before his surgery, and presented no sign of any other cognitive impairment. It wasn't until after his death that researchers had the chance to examine his brain, when they found his lesions were restricted to the CA1 portion of the hippocampus. <b>This</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> led to important research involving the role of the hippocampus and the function of memory.|$|E
25|$|The species {{within the}} {{hymenopteran}} order commonly sting or bite others {{with which they}} interact. After a man was stung by a European hornet, he experienced tingling {{at the site of}} contact, as well as headaches and shortness of breath. In the hospital, he was found to have a fast, irregular heartbeat with a blood pressure of 111/63. His subsequent ECG demonstrated atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. V. crabro toxin contains neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenalineneurotoxin apamin, as well as enzymes phospholipase A and hyaluronidase, the compound histamine, and proteins melittin and bradykinin. These compounds have been shown to cause tachycardia episodes in smaller animals. The mechanism of this attack is still undetermined, but this man possibly was just more susceptible to vespine stings than other humans. Currently, the two most effective treatments are electrical cardioversion or propafenone. The man in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> was given an oral dose of propafenone (150mg) and his atrial fibrillation resolved.|$|E

2500|$|Studies were {{completed}} consistently throughout Molaison's lifetime to discover more about amnesia. Researchers did a 14-year follow-up study on Molaison. [...] They studied {{him for a}} period of two weeks to learn more about his amnesia. After 14 years, Molaison still could not recall things that had happened since his surgery. However, he could still remember things that had happened prior to the operation. Researchers also found that, when asked, Molaison could answer questions about national or international events, but he could not remember his own personal memories. [...] After his death Molaison donated his brain to science, where they were able to discover the areas of the brain that had the lesions which caused his amnesia. <b>This</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> provided important insight to the areas of the brain that are affected in anterograde amnesia, as well as how amnesia works.|$|E

50|$|In <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>study,</b> Hinskens (1998) {{researches}} dialect levelling in the Dutch {{province of}} Limburg. Based on his findings, {{he argues that}} dialect levelling does not necessarily lead to convergence towards the standard language. The research for <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> takes place in Rimburg, a small village on the southeast of Limburg, where Ripuarian dialects are spoken. The southeast area of Limburg experienced rapid industrialisation {{at the turn of}} the 20th century with the largescale development of coal mining. That created several job opportunities, which led to considerable immigration to the area (Hinskens pp: 38), which, in turn, led to language contact and a diversification of language varieties. It is the area that most of the dialect levelling occurred.|$|E

50|$|<b>This</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> began {{a public}} {{conversation}} among both {{urban and rural}} people about intellectual property and cultural heritage in Kyrgyzstan, a post-Soviet nation where ties to the past have been attenuated and even severed.
