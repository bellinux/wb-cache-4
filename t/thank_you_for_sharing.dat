[...] The two-part show featured appearances by Aretha Franklin, Tom Cruise, Stevie Wonder, Patti LaBelle, Beyoncé, Tom Hanks, Maria Shriver, Will Smith, and Madonna. [...] The final episode was a smaller affair, recorded in the usual recording studio. Several hundred graduates of Morehouse College who were the recipients of Oprah's Oprah Winfrey Scholarship also attended to thank Oprah and pledge their future support of the scholarship program. Winfrey spent most of the finale thanking the show's staff and her fans. I've been asked many times during this farewell season, 'Is ending the show bittersweet?' Well, I say all sweet. No bitter. And here is why: Many of us have been together for 25 years. We have hooted and hollered together, had our aha! moments, we ugly-cried together and we did our gratitude journals.

Though I am usually a pretty rational guy, if I have something on my mind and I see an 11 somewhere, I know I’m on the right path. It’s one of my last remaining superstitions. 2011 has a nice ring to it if you’re so inclined, it may be the last year ever! So why not say YES? Why not say YES to Coachella? Why not say YES to playing the music we designed to be an undeniable source of power? Why not say YES to stirring up a writhing pit of sweaty humans? YES to riots! YES to heavy music! YES instead of maybe, and YES to make death your adviser and remind yourself always, {{that this is not a}} dress rehearsal. This is the big show.Jesse and I have decided that what we can do together should not be denied. Together again, as was always the intention, as a collaboration. The collision of two different worlds. As this all takes shape, we will reveal it to you. All of it happening, as it always has, in our own way. <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> all <b>for</b> <b>sharing</b> in our excitement!The band performed a new song while performing at EdgeFest on July 14, 2012 at Downsview Park in Toronto.

On October 28, 2012, the band's blog was updated in lieu of excitement for their string of shows around Canada. In the post, Grainger cited that they were [...] "coming to share new material, and to work out the kinks". The band was originally scheduled to perform at Governors Ball Music Festival in June 2013, but later announced that they were having unexpected trouble while working on new music and cancelled their appearance.

40|$|Ah, [...] {{the eternal}} {{question}} for every honors student: What will I do for my thesis? An analysis of bioethics? A biographical {{study of the}} heroes of the French Revolution? Nah. Instead, we opted for the "creative project" alternative, which we took to mean, "put on a concert {{with a bunch of}} your friends". Little did we know what this would entail. "Closer to Fine" began as a "wouldn't it-be- cool if…" idea last fall, which developed out of our <b>shared</b> love <b>for</b> music and literature.

Ever the environmentalists, we decided to recycle the concept that wed come up with in November, and hence, "Closer to Fine" became a reality, and a quickly approaching reality at that. So we immediately began the process of putting together a recital that would prove to be a "capstone" of our education. This involved not only a great deal of commitment on our part, but also drawing upon the various resources and connections that each of us had made throughout our years at Bait State [...] friends, faculty, and performers [...] and convincing all of them that we could really put this off by March. It is with their help and a lot of hard work that we were able to present such a celebration. And a celebration it is, for we have always believed that women have a special style of communication through their words and music. Not necessarily a "better" style, but one that is unique and powerful, and therefore worthy of sharing with all of you. We hope that through this performance you. may catch a glimpse of what we find so amazing, so thrilling about the contributions of each of these women, and of all women. It is only through sharing the "spark of divinity" that is ours alone that we daily become "Closer to Fine.
