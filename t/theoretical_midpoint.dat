In that case, the production price is a <b>theoretical</b> <b>midpoint</b> which fluctuating actual prices would match exactly only by exception.|$|E
40|$|The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) was {{translated}} into 28 languages and administered to 16, 998 participants across 53 nations. The RSES factor structure was largely invariant across nations. RSES scores correlated with neuroticism, extraversion, and romantic attachment styles within nearly all nations, providing additional support for cross-cultural equivalence of the RSES. All nations scored above the <b>theoretical</b> <b>midpoint</b> of the RSES, indicating generally positive self-evaluation may be culturally universal. Individual differences in self-esteem were variable across cultures, with a neutral response bias prevalent in more collectivist cultures. Self-competence and self-liking subscales of the RSES varied with cultural individualism. Although positively and negatively worded items of the RSES were correlated within cultures and were uniformly related to external personality variables, differences between aggregates {{of positive and negative}} items were smaller in developed nations. Because negatively worded items were interpreted differently across nations, direct cross-cultural comparisons using the RSES may have limited value...|$|E
40|$|Interviewers {{administered}} the Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale (RSES) to five groups of Black (formal township and informal settlement), White, Indian, and mixed race adult residents of Greater Pretoria. The results {{demonstrated that the}} RSES was psychometrically sound for the five groups. The minimal effects of sociodemographic characteristics on global self-esteem showed that the RSES and its two dimensions, self-competence (SC) and self-liking (SL), were suitable in this setting. All five groups scored above the <b>theoretical</b> <b>midpoint</b> of the RSES, indicating that generally positive selfevaluations appear to be universal. The relationships between positively and negatively worded items, SC, and SL attested to the following: internal structure reliability, congruence between positive and negative items, no negative biases in response, and concordance between SC and SL dimensions. The significant differences between informal settlement residents and the other four groups on global self-esteem, positively and negatively worded items, and SC and SL were possibly due to physiological needs taking precedence over higher order needs.

40|$|The {{photosynthetic}} reaction {{center of}} Rhodopseudomonas viridis has four hemes in a linear arrangement with alternating high- and low-potential sites. Their midpoints are - 60, 20, 310, and 380 mV [Dracheva, S. M., Drachev, L. A., Konstantinov, A. A., Semenov, A. Y., Skulachev, V. P., Arutjunjan, A. M., Shuvalov, V. A. & Zaberezhnaya, S. M. (1988) Eur. J. Biochem. 171, 253 - 264]. Electrostatic calculations reproduce the 440 -mV midpoint spread and assignments of high- and low-potential hemes. When calculations on model compounds {{to connect the}} <b>theoretical</b> <b>midpoints</b> to the standard hydrogen electrode are used, the absolute electrochemical midpoints for the reaction center hemes are also in good agreement with experiment. The free energy of oxidation {{is found to be}} dependent on pairwise interactions with charged amino acids, heme propionic acids, previously oxidized hemes, and axial ligands and on the reaction field induced by heme oxidation...|$|R
40|$|Among Likert scale {{research}} spanning {{a number}} of disciplines are studies reaching conflicting conclusions about the theoretical and psychometric necessity of the midpoint. Typically, midpoint responders have been classified as 2 ̆ 2 ambivalent, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 indifferent, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 uncertain. 2 ̆ 2 Theoretically, a midpoint response should represent ambivalent attitudes [...] those {{who are familiar with}} what they are rating and have equal feelings of agreement and disagreement. Item Response Theory (IRT) research has not supported the utility of the midpoint. The theory underlying this dissertation is that by providing a second nondirectional category (Don 2 ̆ 7 t Know), the midpoint (Undecided) would function more like a <b>theoretical</b> true <b>midpoint,</b> thereby improving scale properties. Hypotheses were studied using Bock 2 ̆ 7 s (1972) Nominal Response and Samejima 2 ̆ 7 s (1969) Graded Response IRT models. Comparisons of option characteristic curves, discrimination parameters, information functions, relative efficiency, and model fit were made between Scale A (5 alternatives with additional sixth Don 2 ̆ 7 t Know alternative) and Scale B (5 alternatives) across 18 items in two demographically similar independent samples. ^ Findings generally supported the hypothesis that providing a sixth Don 2 ̆ 7 t Know alternative improves the operating characteristics of the middle category, as well as other categories. Scale A items tended to have discrimination parameters and scale information exceeding that of Scale B, particularly on items measuring general attitudes as opposed to specific behavioral outcomes. ^ The Undecided category had highest probabilities at low negative to middle levels of theta in both scales, and Undecided category Option Characteristic Curves tended to peak above that of other categories, more so on Scale A. Both nondirectional categories appeared to be scale dependent. The Don 2 ̆ 7 t Know response option consistently peaked {{to the left of the}} scale. Implications are that by using IRT to understand the properties of different options, psychometricians can develop more efficient measures of attitude and practitioners can gain a more precise understanding of the meaning attached to different options. Limitations and future research are discussed. ...|$|R
