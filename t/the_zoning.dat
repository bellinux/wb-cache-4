5|$|The O-Bahn {{has caused}} a {{clustering}} of commercial and community development near the Tea Tree Plaza Interchange, as service-providing organisations and businesses have sought to exploit the area's easy accessibility to public transport and the city centre. Market imperatives have also been aided by <b>the</b> <b>zoning</b> of the land around the area as commercial rather than residential. The area around Tea Tree Plaza {{is one of five}} designated regional centres within the Adelaide metropolis.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>zoning</b> {{plan for}} the station was passed in 1998 and demands for {{accessibility}} were laid down in 2003, causing a contrast between these goals and the curved platforms. This would particularly be a challenge for the Class 70 trains, which would have a wide gap. Part of the dispute centered on the Vollsveien Bridge, {{whether or not it}} had a heritage status and whether or not its demolition would allow for a straight station. Minister of Transport and Communication Torild Skogsholm stated that she laid the blame on director of the National Rail Administration, Steinar Killi. Her successor, Liv Signe Navarsete, announced in July 2006 that the construction would continue following the curved design, though minor functional changes would be made.|$|E

25|$|There {{is also a}} legal hurdle to {{the various}} {{construction}} plans because of the existing zoning restrictions in the proposed location for the new buildings.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>zoning</b> {{plan was}} {{slightly}} changed in August. The W-1 area expanded a block {{and a half}} north of K Street NW and a block and a half west of 31st Street NW. The W-2 area expanded north to M Street NW as well as east to include a section bounded by the Potomac River, 30th Street NW, M Street NW, Pennsylvania Avenue NW, and 29th Street NW. The W-3 area above the C Canal was converted into W-1 zoned space. Public hearings on the revised plan began on August 6. The NCPC opposed the proposed regulations, arguing that it permitted buildings that were too high, did not regulate rooftop structures (such as penthouses or towers), provided too many exceptions for industrial use, and did not adequately protect historic structures. A group of local citizens and consultants known as the Georgetown Planning Group argued that the proposed rules permitted development that was too dense and too tall, and which would draw too much automobile and pedestrian traffic to the area. On November 15, <b>the</b> <b>zoning</b> board postponed action on the rezoning plan until the NCPC finished its regional planning exercise for the same area.|$|E
