Records in partnership with pianist/arranger/producer Seth Farber and record producer Mark Carpentieri. These included Blues Everywhere I Go, a 2000 Grammy-nominated blues/jazz band tribute album to the great lady blues singers of the 1920s and 1930s; Looking for a Home, a 2002 W.C. Handy Award-nominated band tribute to Lead Belly; and the 2007 Grammy-nominated Gonna Let It Shine, a live album of gospel and spiritual songs supported by Seth Farber and The Holmes Brothers. These recordings and active touring led to guest appearance on fourteen new albums by other artists between 1999 and 2006 and the re-release of 45 old Odetta albums and compilation appearances.|$|E

DiCola is the only person, other than Bill Conti, to act as composer on a Rocky film and his work was used extensively on the 1991 compilation CD The Rocky Story: Songs from the Rocky Movies.

500|$|The {{finishing}} touches to the album {{were done in}} September 2007, but the European release of the album was delayed until March 2008.

500|$|After collaborating on {{her great}} successes The Woman in Me (1995) and Come on Over (1997), Twain and her then-husband Robert John [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange {{decided to take}} a musical hiatus. The two {{relocated}} to Switzerland, settled down, and had a child, Eja, in August 2001. Twain felt content and was in a very positive state of mind, which inspired Up! (2002). She and Lange conceptualized the album to be very positive, optimistic, and uplifting; they desired to evade dark subject matters, yet still be profound through optimism. In doing so, they co-wrote every track on Up!, in which few tracks were ballads, something Twain considered a small ratio compared to the nineteen songs on the album. She explained it was not done deliberately, but influenced by her and Lange's state of mind at the time, adding, [...] "There just didn't seem to be enough room for [...] ". One of the ballads was [...] "It Only Hurts when I'm Breathing", which Twain deemed necessary to come down in tempo. She said the song was very powerful and, as with each track on Up!, was significant to her. Twain said of the track, [...] "This is the only heartbreak song on <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>CD.</b> [...] a chance {{for all of us to}} catch our breath here." [...] "It Only Hurts when I'm Breathing" [...] was later selected as the eighth and final single from Up!, fifth to impact the North American music market. It was released to country radio on February 9, 2004 and to adult contemporary radio on March 22, 2004. A live CD single and digital download were taken from Up! Live in Chicago, and released on March 9, 2004 with the same cover as the video album. CD singles and 7" [...] singles were later issued by Mercury Nashville Records on March 30, 2004.|$|E
