5|$|Like other bleeding-hearts, the Sulu bleeding-heart is {{primarily}} a sedentary bird, feeding on <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> and flying only for short distances. It only perches in trees in order to roost or mate. When alarmed, bleeding-hearts run quickly into nearby undergrowth. It is very elusive in its forested habitat, and nothing else is known about its behavior.|$|E
5|$|The {{animals that}} eat the figs {{disperse}} the seeds, which then germinate and grow on other plants (epiphytes) or on rocks (lithophytes). As the new plants develop, they send roots to <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor.</b> Figs growing on other plants grow {{larger and larger}} until they strangle their hosts. Ficus obliqua is long-lived, and trees are thought to live in excess of 500 years.|$|E

5000|$|Hepatica nobilis, {{a synonym}} for Anemone hepatica, the kidneywort, liverwort, pennywort or common hepatica, an {{herbaceous}} plant species native to <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floors</b> of temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere ...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} silvicultural methods on <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> C, N and elements stocks an experiment {{was carried out by}} sampling <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floors</b> of a 100 - 120 years old species including beech, Norway spruce and mixed beech-spruce at <b>the</b> Solling <b>forest,</b> Germany. While <b>the</b> stocks of carbon and nitrogen in <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floors</b> of pure beech and spruce were significantly influenced by species specific differences of litter quality (p< 0. 001), no significant differences were detected between pure and mixed species stands. <b>Forest</b> <b>floor</b> mass, some elements concentrations and C/nutrient ratios were significantly affected by tree species differences, while no clear dependency between pH and site specific effects was found among pure stands. Acid element concentrations in <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floors</b> of pure spruce were remarkably higher than the values obtained at beech stand, while the stocks were to some extent modified in mixed silviculture. The base-pump effect of beech significantly controlled variation between mono cultures on calcium stocks, while the acidifying effect of spruce in mixtures resulted in modification of Ca stocks of <b>forest</b> <b>floors.</b> <b>The</b> status of other nutrient elements at mixed species cultures due to variation in nutritional properties and composition of litter compared to pure species were between the range of values observed in mono cultures...|$|R
5|$|The {{avifauna}} {{consists of}} various types of laughing thrushes, which live in shrubs and on <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor.</b> The blue whistling-thrush, redstarts, and forktails are found near waterfalls and hill-streams. The mixed hunting species present in the region include warblers, tit-babblers, treecreepers, white-eyes, wrens, and rose finches. Raptors such as black eagle, black-winged kite and kestrels; and pheasants such as monals and blood pheasant are also found.|$|E
5|$|The {{silver birch}} has an open canopy which allows plenty {{of light to}} reach the ground. This allows a variety of mosses, grasses and {{flowering}} plants to grow beneath which in turn attract insects. Flowering plants often found in birch woods include primrose (Primula vulgaris), violet (Viola riviniana), bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) and wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella). Small shrubs that grow on <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> include blaeberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea).|$|E
5|$|Although fishers are {{competent}} tree climbers, {{they spend}} most of their time on <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> and prefer continuous forest to other habitats. Fishers have been found in extensive conifer forests typical of the boreal forest but are also common in mixed hardwood and conifer forests. Fishers prefer areas with continuous overhead cover with greater than 80% coverage and will avoid areas with less than 50% coverage. Fishers are more likely to be found in old-growth forests. Since female fishers require moderately large trees for denning, forests that have been heavily logged and have extensive second growth appears to be unsuitable for their needs.|$|E
50|$|Mineral soil seedbeds {{are more}} {{receptive}} than <b>the</b> undisturbed <b>forest</b> <b>floor,</b> and are generally moister and more readily rewetted than <b>the</b> organic <b>forest</b> <b>floor.</b> However, exposed mineral soil, {{much more so}} than organic-surfaced soil, is subject to frost heaving and shrinkage during drought. The forces generated in soil by frost or drought are quite enough to break roots.|$|R
50|$|Warming {{spring and}} summer {{temperatures}} increase flammability of materials that make up <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floors.</b> Warmer temperatures cause dehydration of these materials, which prevents rain from soaking up and dampening fires. Furthermore, pollution from wildfires can exacerbate climate change by releasing atmospheric aerosols, which modify cloud and precipitation patterns.|$|R
50|$|They are {{burrowing}} animals, {{which lay}} eggs that hatch into free-living larvae. Their habitat is primarily {{the soil of}} <b>the</b> tropical <b>forest</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|R
5|$|At Paramount, {{the crew}} filmed all the scenes {{that would take}} place on soundstages, {{including}} the Enterprise and Bird-of-Prey sets, the Paradise City interiors, and the campfire location. Production was smoother on set, and the crew shot scenes ahead of schedule. The crew fabricated a stand-in set for the God planet location, where additional scenes were filmed to combine with the location footage. Spock's catching of Kirk as the captain falls off El Capitan was filmed against a set that replicated <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> and was rotated ninety degrees.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{occupy a}} wide range of {{ecological}} positions. While some birds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements. Even within a single habitat, such as a forest, the niches occupied by different species of birds vary, with some species feeding in the forest canopy, others beneath the canopy, and still others on <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor.</b> Forest birds may be insectivores, frugivores, and nectarivores. Aquatic birds generally feed by fishing, plant eating, and piracy or kleptoparasitism. Birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds, while vultures are specialised scavengers. Avivores are animals that are specialised at preying on birds.|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus piperatus (synonym Lactarius piperatus), {{commonly}} known as the peppery milk-cap, is a semi-edible basidiomycete fungus of the genus Lactifluus. Despite being edible, it is not recommended by some because of its poor taste, though can be used as seasoning when dried. The fruiting body is a creamy-white mushroom which is funnel-shaped when mature, with exceptionally crowded gills. It bleeds a whitish peppery-tasting milk when cut. Widely distributed across Europe and eastern North America, Lactifluus piperatus has been accidentally introduced to Australia. Mycorrhizal, it forms a symbiotic relationship with various species of deciduous tree, including beech, and hazel, and fruiting bodies are found on <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> in deciduous woodland.|$|E

50|$|This slow-growing plant forms {{clusters}} of dark green leaves on <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floors</b> where it grows. It produces white or yellow flowers {{in spring and}} then {{clusters of}} fleshy black fruits. A tough and adaptable plant that easily survives seasonal fires, Brandblaar grows in shady spots in Cape Fynbos, along the coast, in afro-montane forest and just about anywhere else - throughout the Cape Floristic Region, from Cape Town eastwards as far as Grahamstown.|$|R
50|$|Positive {{advantages}} of this practical method of forest management {{was that the}} ash left behind fertilized <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> trees and plants and bark beetles which are ravishing so much of <b>the</b> Western <b>Forests</b> were killed before boring into trees. Pinecones were also liberated by the heat to release their seeds into the soil. In the spring natural grasses provided extensive grazing opportunities for livestock and wildlife inhabiting <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> regions and also provided critical anti-erosion during heavy rains. To return <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> to such pristine grandness will require extensive planning to remove the more dense fuel loads and careful prescribed burns to liquidate remaining pockets of heavy fuels left on <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floors</b> by 70 years of neglect.|$|R
5|$|The {{branches}} of the silver birch often have tangled masses of twigs known as witch's brooms growing among them, caused by the fungus Taphrina betulina. Old trees are often killed by the decay fungus Piptoporus betulinus and fallen branches rot rapidly on <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor.</b> This tree commonly grows with the mycorrhizal fungus Amanita muscaria in a mutualistic relationship. This applies particularly to acidic or nutrient-poor soils. Other mycorrhizal associates include Leccinum scabrum and Cantharellus cibarius. It has been shown that, as well as mycorrhiza, the presence of microfauna in the soil assists {{the growth of the}} tree, as it enhances the mobilization of nutrients.|$|E
5|$|The {{seeds of}} conifers, {{the largest group}} of gymnosperms, are {{enclosed}} in a cone and most species have seeds that are light and papery that can be blown considerable distances once free from the cone. Sometimes the seed remains in the cone for years waiting for a trigger event to liberate it. Fire stimulates release and germination of seeds of the jack pine, and also enriches <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> with wood ash and removes competing vegetation. Similarly, a number of angiosperms including Acacia cyclops and Acacia mangium have seeds that germinate better after exposure to high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Xeromphalina setulipes is {{only known}} from the type {{locality}} {{in the province of}} Ciudad Real, Spain. Members of the Mycenaceae are saprotrophic, and X.setulipes was found in woodland made up of cork oak (Quercus suber) and Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea), with undergrowth consisting of gum rockrose (Cistus ladanifer), prickly juniper (Juniperus oxycedrus), and various heathers (Erica species). The mushrooms were growing in clusters on <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> from acid soil, surrounded by dead plant matter. The species's ecological patterns may be useful identifying characteristics, distinct from other, similar species. The mushrooms were found in autumn, and collected in November.|$|E
60|$|Soon {{they were}} riding into <b>the</b> <b>forest,</b> Creech leading, Lucy in the center, and Joel coming {{behind on the}} King. Two unsaddled mustangs {{carrying}} the packs were driven in front. Creech limited the gait to the best that the pack-horses could do.

25|$|The {{vegetation}} is heterogeneous and storeyed due to {{the prevalence}} of hilly and mountainous relief. In Cluj County can be met {{a wide range of}} plant formations. Sub-alpine floor, present in Vlădeasa Massif and Muntele Mare, is characterized by lawns with midget grasses and juniper bushes. <b>The</b> spruce <b>forests</b> <b>floor,</b> expanded on mountain slopes between 1,000–1,600 m, consists predominantly of spruce mixed with fir, and <b>the</b> deciduous <b>forests</b> <b>floor</b> develops on all forms of relief, ranging from 400–1,000 m, and consists of sessile forests mixed with beech, hornbeam or elm. On slopes with northern exposure of Luna and Lujerdiu valleys develop compact clusters of sessile, hornbeam, ash and elm <b>forests.</b> In <b>the</b> Hilly Plain of Transylvania appear islands of steppe, alternating with patches of forests.|$|R
50|$|Severe {{uprooting}} opens {{bare patches}} of mineral soil that {{can act as}} seed sinks. These patches have been shown, in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, to have higher biodiversity than <b>the</b> surrounding <b>forest</b> <b>floor.</b> Additionally, <b>the</b> gap created in <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> canopy when windthrow occurs yields an increase in light, moisture, and nutrient availability in near proximity to the disturbance.|$|R
5|$|Birds roam from <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> to the canopy, but {{particularly}} favour the middle story. They mostly operate alone, in pairs {{or groups of}} three, and {{can also be found}} mixing with long-billed bernierias. Larger flocks do not occur. The nelicourvi weaver is an agile, active species that generally makes a lot of noise. It searches for insects on leaves, and branches, while hanging from vines and twigs. It looks for animals in rolled leaves such as wild ginger Aframomum and along leaf litter, probing crevices, and opening dead stems. It also dismembers flowers to reach the nectar. Mostly, arthropods (beetles, bugs, butterflies, caterpillars, dragonflies, flies, grasshoppers, leafhoppers, stick insects, millipedes and spiders) are consumed, sometimes small vertebrates (lizards and chameleons), next to some nectar, fruit and probably seeds.|$|E
5|$|In cool {{temperate}} regions, conifers often predominate; {{a widely}} distributed climax {{community in the}} far north of the northern hemisphere is moist taiga or northern coniferous forest (also called boreal forest). Taiga is the world's largest land biome, forming 29% of the world's forest cover. The long cold winter of the far north is unsuitable for plant growth and trees must grow rapidly in the short summer season when the temperature rises and the days are long. Light is very limited under their dense cover {{and there may be}} little plant life on <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor,</b> although fungi may abound. Similar woodland is found on mountains where the altitude causes the average temperature to be lower thus reducing the length of the growing season.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius vietus (commonly {{known as}} the grey milkcap) is a species of fungus in the family Russulaceae, first {{described}} by Elias Magnus Fries. It produces moderately sized and brittle mushrooms, which grow on <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> or on rotting wood. The flattened-convex cap can vary in shape, sometimes forming {{the shape of a}} wide funnel. It is typically grey, but the colour varies. The species has crowded, light-coloured gills, which produce white milk. The spore print is typically whitish, but also varies considerably. The mushrooms typically have a strong, acrid taste and have been described as inedible, but other authors have described them as consumable after boiling. L.vietus feeds by forming an ectomycorrhizal relationship with surrounding trees, and it favours birch. It grows in autumn months and is fairly common in Europe, North America and eastern Asia.|$|E
50|$|The Ariau Towers is a {{boutique}} hotel northwest of Manaus, Brazil, on the Rio Negro, a major {{tributary of the}} Amazon River. It consists of 6 towers, with all 288 rooms elevated from <b>the</b> rain <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> by approximately 10-20m and connected by approximates 5 mi of catwalks.|$|R
40|$|<b>Forest</b> <b>floor</b> {{organic matter}} and {{nutrient}} contents were quantified in 41 first-rotation and seven second-rotation stands of Pinus radiata D. Don (radiata pine) {{growing in the}} North Island. Most of the stands were between 18 and 21 years of age. <b>The</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floors</b> contained an average 20. 7 tonnes of organic matter/ha and 258, 18, 32, and 33 kg/ha of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium, respectively, but there was considerable variation both between and within forests. Ridge and stepwise multiple regression techniques were used to construct models which explained 70, 58, 62, 79, and 82 % of this variation. Stocking levels, rainfall, minimum temperature, and foliage calcium levels {{were the most important}} variables. The second-rotation sites contained on average twice as much organic matter and nutrients as the first-rotation sites. This was attributed to the fact that no slash burning or clearance had been carried {{out at the end of}} the previous rotation. <b>The</b> <b>forest</b> manager can thus make significant changes to <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> dynamics through policies on thinning and slash treatment...|$|R
50|$|Monterey pine is {{a species}} adapted {{to cope with}} stand-killing fire disturbance. Its cones are serotinous, i.e. they remain closed until opened by {{the heat of a}} <b>forest</b> fire; <b>the</b> {{abundant}} seeds are then discharged to regenerate on <b>the</b> burned <b>forest</b> <b>floor.</b> <b>The</b> cones may also burst open in hot weather.|$|R
5|$|Like other bleeding-hearts, the Sulu bleeding-heart is {{primarily}} a sedentary bird, feeding on <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> and flying only for short distances. Little is known about its behavior due to the paucity of sightings. Searches of Tawi-Tawi in 1971 and 1991 did not discover any evidence of the species' continued existence. Most of the bird's habitat was logged on Tawi-Tawi by 1994. However, an ethnobiological survey in 1995 revealed that the bleeding-heart was common until the 1970s and still survives on small islets near Tawi-Tawi. While another survey in 2009 failed to find the species, there is some hope that it may still persist. For this reason, it is currently listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. Any surviving population would be very small, likely numbering fewer than 50 individuals, and would be threatened by habitat destruction and uncontrolled hunting.|$|E
5|$|Over 40 {{species of}} mammals have been documented, {{including}} the black bear, coyote, cougar, bobcat, beaver, river otter, black-tailed deer, and elk. Along the coastline, California sea lions, Steller sea lions and harbor seals {{live near the}} shore and on seastacks, rocky outcroppings forming small islands just off the coast. Dolphins and Pacific gray whales are occasionally seen offshore. Roosevelt elk are the most readily observed of the large mammals in the park. Successful herds, brought back from the verge of extinction in the region, are now a common site in park areas south of the Klamath River. Many smaller mammals live in the high forest canopy. Different species of bats, such as the big brown bat, and other smaller mammals including the red squirrel and northern flying squirrel {{spend most of their}} lives well above <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5|$|The huia's {{movements}} are little known, {{but it was}} most likely sedentary. The huia {{is thought to have}} undertaken seasonal movements, living in montane forests in the summer and moving down into lowland forests in the winter to avoid the harsher weather and cold temperatures of higher altitudes. Like the surviving New Zealand wattlebirds, the saddleback and the kōkako, the huia was a weak flier and could only fly for short distances, and seldom above tree height. More often it would use its powerful legs to propel it in long leaps and bounds through the canopy or across <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor,</b> or it would cling vertically to tree trunks with its tail spread for balance.|$|E
50|$|It is a shy and {{difficult}} tinamou {{to be seen}} on <b>the</b> dark <b>forest</b> <b>floors.</b> Its call is a three-note call and lower than other tinamous. Its calls can be in long bouts, up to five hours at a time. This tinamou and the thicket tinamou will produce hybrids on occasion.|$|R
