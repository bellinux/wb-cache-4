5|$|As {{originally}} {{proposed in}} 1925, the line's junction with the IND Crosstown Line in Long Island City {{would have been}} a <b>T-junction,</b> allowing trains from Manhattan to travel south to Brooklyn via the Crosstown line. A map from June of that year shows a proposed alternate routing for the Queens Boulevard Line, that would have had the line turn via Kew Gardens Road after the Union Turnpike station instead of continuing via Queens Boulevard. After proceeding via Kew Gardens Road the line would have turned via Hillside Avenue. The map also shows a two-track line continuing from the Van Wyck Boulevard station to 94th Avenue (Atlantic Avenue) in Richmond Hill via Van Wyck Boulevard (today's Van Wyck Expressway). During construction only bellmouths were built for the line, however they were eventually used for the IND Archer Avenue Line. As documented by the map, the Queens Boulevard Line, as originally planned, would have had the express trains travel on a more direct route, via Broadway and Queens Boulevard, while the local trains would take a less direct route hitting larger population centers. There were to be two such instances, however only one was actually completed. The first one, which was not constructed, would have gone through Winfield (now Woodside), west of the existing Elmhurst Avenue station, and the local tracks would have diverged, continuing via Queens Broadway before turning onto 69th Street (Fisk Avenue), rejoining the express tracks at Broadway in Woodside. The second instance, the one that was built, was planned to have the local tracks continue via Broadway west of the 65th Street station, and then it would turn south via Steinway Street before rejoining the express tracks at the 36th Street station. The express tracks here would take the more direct route, via Northern Boulevard.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{well-known}} reading pitfall in {{computed tomography}} (CT) colonography is posed by artifacts at <b>T-junctions,</b> i. e., locations where air–fluid levels interface with the colon wall. This paper presents a scale-invariant method to determine material fractions in voxels near such <b>T-junctions.</b> The proposed electronic cleansing method particularly improves the segmentation at those locations. The algorithm takes a vector of Gaussian derivatives as input features. The measured features are made invariant to the orientation-dependent apparent {{scale of the}} data and normalized {{in a way to}} obtain equal noise variance. A so-called parachute model is introduced that maps Gaussian derivatives onto material fractions near <b>T-junctions.</b> Projection of the noisy derivatives onto the model yields improved estimates of the true, underlying feature values. The method is shown to render an accurate representation of the object boundary without artifacts near junctions. Therefore, it enhances the reading of CT colonography in a 3 -D display mode.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a new way}} to create smooth piecewise polynomial free-form spline surfaces from quad- meshes that include <b>T-junctions,</b> where surface strips start or terminate. All mesh nodes can be interpreted as control points of geometrically-smooth, piecewise polynomials that we call GT-splines. GT-splines are B-spline-like and cover <b>T-junctions</b> by two or four patches of degree bi- 4. They complement multi-sided surface constructions in generating free-form surfaces with adaptive layout. Since GT-splines do not require a global coordination of knot intervals, GT-constructions are easy to deploy and can provide smooth surfaces with <b>T-junctions</b> where T-splines can not have a smooth parameterization. GT-constructions display a uniform highlight line distribution on input meshes where alternatives, such as Catmull-Clark subdivision, exhibit oscillations.

40|$|We {{report a}} new {{illusion}} of elasticity in a rigid surface. A square frame is presented behind a concentric occluding cross. When the two surfaces are rotated rigidly, the square frame appears "rubbery", that is, {{it appears to}} contract or expand during the rotation. The rubber square illusion is related {{to a number of}} other illusory phenomena involving motion and surface stratification. It is generally believed that these phenomena are due to suppression of potentially veridical motion signals at <b>t-junctions</b> signalling occlusions. However, in all previously reported phenomena the effect of <b>t-junctions</b> was confounded with effects due to surface relative motion, spatial integration, or relative contrast. Given that none of these potential confounds applies to our demonstration, the rubber square illusion provides critical evidence that <b>t-junctions</b> are sufficient to cause suppression of the corresponding motion signals...|$|R

Previous experiments manipulated element trajectories to prevent intersections of element boundaries, evidently {{in the belief that}} transient overlaps among homogeneous elements make the task too hard. We examine whether depth cues such as occlusion (<b>T-junctions)</b> and disparity affect performance in a tracking task when element boundaries, as projected onto the two-dimensional plane of the monitor screen, are allowed to intersect. Elements move smoothly in depth, as well as in horizontal and vertical position, throughout a 7 -second tracking period.

Overlapping circular objects form <b>T-junctions</b> when shaded to appear like spheres or figure eight regions when rendered as disks. Two factors, disparity and <b>T-junctions,</b> are considered.
