50|$|The <b>time</b> <b>alignment</b> of an amplified music {{signal and}} its {{distortion}} components has {{a profound effect}} on perceived sound quality. Nakamichi researchers discovered that the human ear is much more tolerant of harmonic distortion if the distortion components are time-aligned with respect to the primary signal. Nakamichi Harmonic <b>Time</b> <b>Alignment</b> (HTA) amplifiers adopt a wideband, low open-loop gain design. A minimal amount of negative feedback is used, but, more important, it is kept constant over the entire audio spectrum. This assures the proper timing between the primary signal and any amplifier distortion components. The sonic benefits of this design include powerful, high-resolution bass, a natural, richly detailed midrange, and smooth, clear highs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Spoken {{responses}} {{produced by}} subjects during neuropsychological exams can provide diagnostic markers beyond exam performance. In particular, {{characteristics of the}} spoken language itself can discriminate between subject groups. We present results on the utility of such markers in discriminating between healthy elderly subjects and subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Given the audio and transcript of a spoken narrative recall task, a range of markers are automatically derived. These markers include speech features such as pause frequency and duration, and many linguistic complexity measures. We examine measures calculated from manually annotated <b>time</b> <b>alignments</b> (of the transcript with the audio) and syntactic parse trees, {{as well as the}} same measures calculated from automatic (forced) <b>time</b> <b>alignments</b> and automatic parses. We show statistically significant differences between clinical subject groups for a number of measures. These differences are largely preserved with automation. We then present classification results, and demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in the area under the ROC curve (AUC) when using automatic spoken language derived features in addition to the neuropsychological test scores. Our results indicate that using multiple, complementary measures can aid in automatic detection of MCI. Index Terms—Forced alignment, linguistic complexity, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), parsing, spoken language understanding. I...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Bill Putnam of Universal Audio worked with Ed Long and his {{patented}} <b>Time</b> <b>Alignment</b> crossover design {{to fix the}} long-standing problem of the two bandpasses not being aligned in time at their crossover point. The Altec 604 was given this elaborate new crossover feature and incorporated into the UREI 813 studio monitor, which also had a second woofer physically separate from the coaxial pair. This design dominated recording studios of the 1980s, and <b>time</b> <b>alignment</b> became a feature of competing manufacturers. In the 2000s, digital signal processing (DSP) was used by Fulcrum Acoustic to reduce some of the coaxial drawbacks such the diffraction of the woofer's upper range around the central horn, by filling in this [...] "shadow" [...] with low frequency sound from the compression driver, and by countering the out-of-time reflections bouncing off of the woofer.|$|E
50|$|In this {{technique}} the drivers are physically offset such that their acoustic centres {{lie in the}} same physical plane. This technique is used when no other means of <b>time</b> <b>alignment</b> are available or meant to be used. It simplifies setup for the end user in {{that they do not}} need any special electronics to align the drivers. However, {{this technique}} requires that the exact depths of the acoustic centres be known at design time, so that the physical offset may be introduced in the front panel of the speaker where the drivers mount.|$|E
50|$|Coaxial {{loudspeakers}} {{have been}} used in concerts for on-stage foldback duties, giving musicians a more even sound field because of the single-source characteristic. As well, the enclosure may be made more compact. McCune Sound in San Francisco used Altec 604s in a large proprietary stage wedge in the 1980s, {{and at the same time}} Professional Audio Systems (PAS), using <b>Time</b> <b>Alignment</b> technology from Ed Long, sold the popular SW series of compact stage wedges; offered with a 12- or 15-inch woofer, and having a projecting high-frequency horn as in the 604. Other stage monitors using coaxial designs are made by Clair Brothers, L-Acoustics, Radian Audio Engineering, RCF, Beyma, dB Technologies, Fulcrum Acoustic, and Rat Sound in partnership with Eastern Acoustic Works.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We have {{recently}} {{found that the}} computation time of homology-based subcellular localization can be substantially reduced by aligning profiles up to the cleavage site positions of signal peptides, mitochondrial targeting peptides, and chloroplast transit peptides [1]. While the method can reduce the profile <b>alignment</b> <b>time</b> {{by as much as}} 20 folds, it cannot reduce the computation time spent on creating the profiles. In this paper, we propose a new approach that can reduce both the profile creation <b>time</b> and profile <b>alignment</b> <b>time.</b> In the new approach, instead of cutting the profiles, we shorten the sequences by cutting them at the cleavage site locations. The shortened sequences are then presented to PSI-BLAST to compute the profiles. Experimental results and analysis of profile-alignment score matrices suggest that both profile creation <b>time</b> and profile <b>alignment</b> <b>time</b> can be reduced without sacrificing subcellular localization accuracy. Once a pairwise profile-alignment score matrix has been obtained, a one-vs-rest SVM classifier can be trained. To further reduce the training and recognition time of the classifier, we propose a perturbation discriminant analysis (PDA) technique. It was found that PDA enjoys a short training time as compared to the conventional SVM.

50|$|Chester {{focused on}} {{teaching}} skills like creativity, improvisation, four-limb independence and ambidexterity, cross-dominance, playing solid <b>time,</b> <b>alignment</b> of limbs, and making an independent {{contribution to the}} song while playing to match the song rather than playing to show off. For example, his instructional techniques included learning to overcome their natural handedness (or laterality) by playing both right-handed and left-handed. This offered the studio pro greater flexibility, smoother groove transition, and a more complex, unbroken riff or fill. This ambidexterity also permitted the drummer to switch the ostinato from right-to-left or vice versa, thereby letting the free hand (or foot) develop a richer drum melody. One additional benefit was more open handed drumming which increases hand mobility around the set as the drummer {{does not need to}} cross and uncross his or her arms as often.|$|E
5000|$|Transient {{response}} : A {{system may}} have low distortion for a steady-state signal, {{but not on}} sudden transients. In amplifiers, this problem {{can be traced to}} power supplies in some instances, to insufficient high frequency performance or to excessive negative feedback. Related measurements are slew rate and rise time. Distortion in transient response can be hard to measure. Many otherwise good power amplifier designs have been found to have inadequate slew rates, by modern standards. In loudspeakers, transient response performance is affected by the mass and resonances of drivers and enclosures and by group delay and phase delay introduced by crossover filtering or inadequate <b>time</b> <b>alignment</b> of the loudspeaker's drivers. Most loudspeakers generate significant amounts of transient distortion, though some designs are less prone to this (e.g. electrostatic loudspeakers, plasma arc tweeters, ribbon tweeters and horn enclosures with multiple entry points).|$|E
5000|$|In 1975 Ed Long in {{cooperation}} with Ronald J. Wickersham invented the first technique to Time-Align a loudspeaker systems. In 1976 Long presented [...] "A Time-Align Technique for Loudspeakers System Design" [...] at the 54th AES convention demonstrating {{the use of the}} Time-Align generator to design improved crossover networks for multi-way loudspeakers systems. This technique relied on subjective evaluation of various square pulses swept through the crossover frequencies. The Time-Align Generator locked the pulse on an oscilloscope so that it could be viewed. The Time-Align technique was employed by Long on the UREI 813 Studio monitor introduced in 1977. Long also manufactured near field studio monitors from the late 1970s through the 90's utilizing the Time-Align technique. In 1977 Long trademarked Time-Align and later trademarked its derivatives, Time Aligned and <b>Time</b> <b>Alignment.</b> Long Licensed the Time-Align trademark to UREI, Bag End Loudspeakers and others.|$|E

From the phonetic <b>time</b> <b>alignments</b> generated by SRI’s Decipher ™ HMM-based speech recognition system, we use various probabilistic models to produce pronunciation scores for the phone utterance. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms by measuring how well the machine-produced scores correlate with human judgments on a large database. Of the various algorithms considered, the one based on phone log-posterior-probability produced the highest correlation (r xy = 0. 72) with the human ratings, which was comparable with correlations between human raters. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Time series occur {{throughout}} {{nature and}} within almost every discipline of science. Producing accurate <b>alignments</b> of <b>time</b> series data was made feasible with the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm. Through stretching and compressing of individual {{points in time}} series data, this algorithm produces accurate and intuitive global <b>time</b> series <b>alignments.</b> In this paper, we extend the DTW algorithm to perform pseudo-local alignments with the Local Dynamic Time Warping (LDTW) algorithm. We apply the LDTW algorithm to simple time series data to demonstrate its ability to find local areas of high similarity. Finally, we present the use of LDTW as an initial step for extending a recent and more robust HMM <b>times</b> series <b>alignment</b> algorithm to also allow it to perform local alignments. I...|$|R
50|$|For most {{purposes}} the tilted lobe poses {{no problems}} and indeed many speaker {{systems that are}} made/sold do not use <b>time</b> <b>alignment.</b> However, there {{is a type of}} crossover called the LR4 or LR2 crossover, which has certain unique features that make time-alignment worthwhile for speakers that use it. This particular crossover has the property that at the crossover frequency the electrical summing is flat (i.e., there is no peak or dip) and the signals being sent to the woofer and tweeter are always in phase (180° out of phase in the LR2 case, which is corrected by simply inverting the tweeter's signal). When used with a loudspeaker that is time-aligned, the loudspeaker's main lobe now points exactly forward (i.e., straight) and does not have a 3dB peak in response. This makes the LR2 or LR4 crossovers ideal for audio as compared to the Butterworth type. Even without a LR crossover, it is worthwhile to have the main lobe point forward so that the speakers will illuminate the listening position evenly, resulting in better overall system performance (such as imaging or audibility).|$|E
5000|$|In 1989 Nakamichi, {{along with}} Pioneer, teamed with Toyota Corp. {{to produce a}} premium sound system in its Lexus line of automobiles. In 1990, Nakamichi {{introduced}} the music bank in its CD players {{which was based on}} a single loading tray concept with a total capacity of 7 CDs. This differed {{from the rest of the}} industry which typically offered a self-loading magazine or a carousel. Nakamichi further enhanced the music bank system in its 1992 offering (MB line) touting the quickest changer in the market. However, the quick changer concept experienced frequent jamming in its machines and as a result, required the company to redesign the mechanism in 1994 with a slight delay during the loading process. While this was corrected, Nakamichi's footing in the digital age was not concrete. In fact, its presence in the rapidly growing audio/video arena was modest at best with its Sansui sourced [...] AV-1 and AV-2 receivers (introduced in 1991). Further impacting its audio reputation was the ending of the licensing agreement with Nelson Pass for the use of the Stasis technology. Without it, its line of preamplifiers and power amplifiers were compromised; its technological advantage, more important in the high end audio market, was lost. Nakamichi attempted to counter the loss with its receivers touting Harmonic <b>Time</b> <b>Alignment</b> (HTA).|$|E
