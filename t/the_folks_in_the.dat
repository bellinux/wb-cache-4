2500|$|The {{tendency}} to incorporate place names known to <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> idiom {{of the poems}} is another characteristic feature of Tevaram. [...] The poems also involved glorifying the feat of Shiva in the particular location - the usage of locale continuously occurring in the verses is a testament. [...] According to Prentiss, the poems do not represent social space as a contested space, the hymns represent the hymnists were free to wander and to offer their praise of Shiva. The emotional intensity of the hymns represent spontaneous expression of thought as an emotional responses to God.|$|E

60|$|In {{the first}} place his plan was working beautifully. You {{know what he was}} after was to get Reddy Fox over to that farm where Bowser was. He hoped that if Reddy should catch one of those fat hens, the farmer would put Bowser on Reddy's trail.

Of course, it all depended on whether Reddy would catch one of those fat hens and whether Bowser would be allowed to hunt him.

6000|$|... "A sure thing," [...] Carroll agreed. [...] "The only {{drawback}} {{is that when}} you've got your fox or otter, it isn't worth anything. A good many of <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> newer lands have {{to make something of}} the kind of effort you described every day. In their case, the results are waggon-trails, valleys cleared for orchards, new branch railroads. I suppose it's a matter of opinion, but if I'd put in a season's risky work I'd sooner have a piece of land to grow fruit on, or a share in a mineral claim--you get plenty of excitement in prospecting--than a fox's tail.

The news was brought to Fairoaks, and received by the ladies there, and by Mr. Pen, with some excitement. [...] "Mrs. Pybus says there is a very pretty girl in the family, Arthur," [...] Laura said, who was as kind and thoughtful upon this point as women generally are: [...] "a Miss Amory, Lady Clavering's daughter by her first marriage.

6000|$|The Doctor's first rhyme {{would make}} any Jew sick: I know it has made a fine lady in blue sick, For which she is gone in a coach to Killbrew sick, Like a hen I once had, from a fox when she flew sick: Last Monday a lady at St. Patrick's did spew sick: And made {{all the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pew sick, The surgeon who bled her his lancet out drew sick, And stopp'd the distemper, as being but new sick.

6000|$|The {{streets are}} {{generally}} about {{wide enough for}} one wagon, and how they do swarm with people! It is Broadway repeated in every street, in every court, in every alley! Such masses, such throngs, such multitudes of hurrying, bustling, struggling humanity! We never saw the like of it, hardly even in New York, I think. There are seldom any sidewalks, and when there are, they are not often wide enough to pass a man on without caroming on him. So everybody walks in the street--and where the street is wide enough, carriages are forever dashing along. Why a thousand people are not run over and crippled {{every day is a}} mystery that no man can solve. But if there is an eighth wonder in the world, it must be the dwelling-houses of Naples. I honestly believe a good majority of them are a hundred feet high! And the solid brick walls are seven feet through. You go up nine flights of stairs before you get to the [...] "first" [...] floor. No, not nine, but there or thereabouts. There is a little bird-cage of an iron railing in front of every window clear away up, up, up, among the eternal clouds, where the roof is, and there is always somebody looking out of every window--people of ordinary size looking out from the first floor, people a shade smaller from the second, people that look a little smaller yet from the third--and from thence upward they grow smaller and smaller by a regularly graduated diminution, till <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> topmost windows seem more like birds in an uncommonly tall martin-box than any thing else. The perspective of one of these narrow cracks of streets, with its rows of tall houses stretching away till they come together in the distance like railway tracks; its clothes-lines crossing over at all altitudes and waving their bannered raggedness over the swarms of people below; and the white-dressed women perched in balcony railings {{all the way from the}} pavement up to the heavens--a perspective like that is really worth going into Neapolitan details to see.|$|E
6000|$|Holding the purse-strings {{in her own}} control, to which, indeed, {{she liked}} to bring most persons who came near her, Lady Castlewood could command her husband's obedience, and so broke up her {{establishment}} at London; she had removed from Lincoln's-Inn-Fields to Chelsey, to a pretty new house she bought there; and brought her establishment, her maids, lap-dogs, and gentlewomen, her priest, and his lordship her husband, to Castlewood Hall, {{that she had never}} seen since she quitted it as a child with her father during the troubles of King Charles the First's reign. The walls were still open in the old house as they had been left by the shot of the Commonwealthmen. A part of the mansion was restored and furbished up with the plate, hangings, and furniture brought from the house in London. My lady meant to have a triumphal entry into Castlewood village, and expected the people to cheer as she drove over the Green in her great coach, my lord beside her, her gentlewomen, lap-dogs, and cockatoos on the opposite seat, six horses to her carriage, and servants armed and mounted following it and preceding it. But 'twas in the height of the No-Popery cry; <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> village and the neighboring town were scared by the sight of her ladyship's painted face and eyelids, as she bobbed her head out of the coach window, meaning, no doubt, to be very gracious; and one old woman said, [...] "Lady Isabel! lord-a-mercy, it's Lady Jezebel!" [...] a name by which the enemies of the right honorable Viscountess were afterwards in the habit of designating her. The country was then in a great No-Popery fervor; her ladyship's known conversion, and her husband's, the priest in her train, and the service performed at the chapel of Castlewood (though the chapel had been built for that worship before any other was heard of in the country, and though the service was performed in the most quiet manner), got her no favor at first in the county or village. By far the greater part of the estate of Castlewood had been confiscated, and been parcelled out to Commonwealthmen. One or two of these old Cromwellian soldiers were still alive in the village, and looked grimly at first upon my Lady Viscountess, when she came to dwell there.|$|E
