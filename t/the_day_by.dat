5|$|June 12, 1899, {{was the day}} of the Gollmar Brothers Circus, {{which drew}} {{hundreds}} of visitors in addition to the town's 1,800 inhabitants. Around 3:00p.m., clouds began to build, and the sky became quite dark. As the circus ended for the day around 4:30 PM, a heavy rain, with some hail, began to fall. The rain let up around 5:00 PM, and people began to head home for <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> <b>By</b> 6:00 PM, the streets of New Richmond were full of tourists, travelers and residents.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Panzer Division, {{advancing}} on {{the left}} flank of Großdeutschland, made good progress {{and by the end}} of the day had captured Gertsovka and reached Mikhailovka. The 167th Infantry Division, on the right flank of the 11th Panzer Division, also made sufficient progress, reaching Tirechnoe by the end of <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> <b>By</b> the end of 5 July, a wedge had been created in the first belt of the Soviet defences.|$|E
5|$|The four {{remaining}} North Korean pilots immediately {{retreated to}} the north. The aircraft likely staged at Pyongyang Air Base, and informed their superiors.

5|$|The tidal {{acceleration}} of the Moon slows the rotation rate of the Earth and increases the Earth-Moon distance. Friction effects—between the core and mantle and between the atmosphere and surface—can dissipate the Earth's rotational energy. These combined effects are expected to increase the length of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>by</b> more than 1.5hours over the next 250 million years, and to increase the obliquity by about a half degree. The distance to the Moon will increase by about 1.5 Earth radii during the same period.|$|E

5|$|Although the 25th Division {{generally}} {{was under}} less pressure from North Korean units after September 5, {{there were still}} severe local attacks. On September 6, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry, moved north from the Haman area to join 2nd Battalion in the cleanup of North Korean troops behind the 35th Infantry and below the Nam River. Caught between the 35th Infantry on its hill positions along {{the river and the}} attacking 27th Infantry units, large numbers of North Koreans were killed. Sixteen different groups reportedly were dispersed with heavy casualties during <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> <b>By</b> morning of September 7 there was clear evidence that survivors of the NK 7th Division were trying to escape across the Nam River. However the North Koreans launched another attack against the 35th Infantry, which it quickly repulsed. The 25th Infantry Division buried more than 2,000 North Korean dead, killed between September 1 and 7 behind its lines. This number did not include those killed in front of its positions.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of 16 January, the seas were still rough, whilst hunger and panic had taken over on the wreck. When a large raft {{carrying}} the wounded, two women and six children was launched during a lull in the weather, over 120 unwounded men scrambled to board it. This severely overloaded the craft and within minutes a large wave struck the heavy raft and capsized it, drowning all aboard. By the evening, the remaining survivors, without food or fresh water, began to succumb to exposure, {{and at least one}} officer drowned {{in a desperate attempt to}} swim to shore. Throughout the night, the survivors gathered on the less exposed parts of the hull, and, in the hope of staving off death by dehydration, drank sea water, urine, or vinegar from a small barrel that had floated up from the hold. The morning of 17January finally saw a reduction in the storm and the arrival of a small French naval brig, the Arrogante. This ship could not come close without the risk of grounding but sent her boats to the wreck in the hope of rescuing survivors. The brig was joined later in <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>by</b> the cutter Aiguille.|$|E
5|$|Delhi's {{association}} and geographic {{proximity to the}} capital, New Delhi, has amplified the importance of national events and holidays like Republic Day, Independence Day (15 August) and Gandhi Jayanti. On Independence Day, the Prime Minister addresses the nation from the Red Fort. Most Delhiites celebrate <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>by</b> flying kites, which are considered a symbol of freedom. The Republic Day Parade is a large cultural and military parade showcasing India's cultural diversity and military strength. Over the centuries, Delhi has become known for its composite culture, and a festival that symbolises this is the Phool Walon Ki Sair, which takes place in September. Flowers and pankhefans embroidered with flowersare offered to the shrine of 13th century Sufi saint Khwaja Bakhtiyar Kaki and the Yogmaya temple, both situated in Mehrauli.|$|E

5|$|In September 1958, Tintin {{magazine}} {{moved its}} headquarters to a newly constructed building near the Gare du Midi. Hergé continued to feud with Leblanc over {{the direction of}} the magazine; his constant absences had led to him being replaced as artistic director, and he demanded that he be reinstated. Leblanc relented in early 1965, although Hergé soon departed to Sardinia for six weeks. In October 1965 Leblanc appointed the cartoonist Greg to be editor-in-chief of the magazine, believing him capable of reforming the paper to remain relevant to the youth of <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> <b>By</b> this point, Tintin magazine was at its commercial peak, with sales of 600,000 a week, although Hergé had lost much of his interest in it.|$|E

5|$|On February 12, {{most of the}} Union troops {{departed}} Fort Henry, {{where they}} were waiting for the return of Union gunboats and the arrival of additional troops that would increase the Union forces to about 25,000 men. The Union forces proceeded about 5 miles (8km) on the two main roads leading between the two forts. They were delayed most of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>by</b> a cavalry screen commanded by Nathan Bedford Forrest. Forrest's troops, sent out by Buckner, spotted a detachment from McClernand's division and opened fire against them. A brief skirmish ensued until orders from Buckner arrived to fall back within the entrenchments. After this withdrawal of Forrest's cavalry, the Union troops moved closer to the Confederate defense line while trying to cover any possible Confederate escape routes. McClernand's division made up the right of Grant's army with C.F. Smith's division forming the left. USS Carondelet was the first gunboat to arrive up the river, and she promptly fired numerous shells into the fort, testing its defenses before retiring. Grant arrived on February 12 and established his headquarters near {{the left side of the}} front of the line, at the Widow Crisp's house.|$|E

5|$|The loss of {{the ability}} to raise funds through the sale of land {{hampered}} the Company's ability to pay dividends to its shareholders, and caused its development of Southern Rhodesia to slow. Believing that membership in the union could help solve both problems, the Company now backed Southern Rhodesia's incorporation as South Africa's fifth province. However, this prospect proved largely unpopular among Southern Rhodesian settlers, most of whom wanted self-government, and came to vote for the RGA in large numbers. In the 1920 Legislative Council election, the RGA won ten of the 13 seats contested. A referendum on the colony's future was held on 27 October 1922—at the suggestion of Winston Churchill, then Britain's Colonial Secretary, continuing the initiative of his preprocessor Viscount Milner—and responsible government won <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>by</b> 59%. Southern Rhodesia was duly annexed by the Empire on 12 September 1923, and granted full self-government on 1 October the same year. The new Southern Rhodesian government immediately purchased the land from the British Treasury for £2million, and ten years later paid the same sum to the British South Africa Company for the country's mineral rights.|$|E
5|$|The ship's {{assignment}} at {{the beginning}} of the Pacific War was to support the invasion of the Philippines, initially by attacking the American naval base at Davao, Mindanao on the morning of 8 December. Her air group had not changed, but four of each type of aircraft were spares. Ryūjōs initial airstrike consisted of 13 B5Ns escorted by nine A5Ms with a smaller, follow-on airstrike later in <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>by</b> two B5Ns and three A5Ms. They accomplished little, destroying two Consolidated PBY seaplanes on the ground for the loss of one B5N and A5M. The ship covered the landing at Davao on 20 December and her B5Ns attacked a British oil tanker south of Davao. In January 1942 her aircraft supported Japanese operations in the Malay Peninsula.|$|E

On the first day, Edrich gloved a rising Lindwall {{delivery}} and was caught by Tallon for 32, leaving England at 5/119. Compton returned at the fall of Edrich's wicket after previously leaving the ground after being bloodied {{in the head by}} a Lindwall bouncer. He batted to stumps, after being dropped one-handed on 50 by Tallon, before again being dropped on 64 late in <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>by</b> the gloveman from the bowling of Johnston. England closed at 7/231 with Compton on 64.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Cyclone Kate was a {{short-lived}} Category 2 cyclone that remained nearly stationary for its entire {{existence in the}} northwestern Coral Sea in February 2006. Forming out of a monsoonal trough on 22 February, Kate rapidly intensified throughout <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> <b>By</b> 23 February, the system attained its peak intensity with winds of 95km/h (60mph 10-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 985hPa (mbar). Shortly thereafter, increasing wind shear caused the storm to quickly weaken. By 24 February, the system dissipated over open waters near Queensland, Australia. Although Kate did not directly affect land, large swells produced by the storm impaced beaches in Papua New Guinea and Queensland. The waves injured six people in Australia, although no property damage was reported.|$|E
5|$|A {{high level}} of {{insulation}} was used to keep the building warm during the winter months. This approach, however, brings with it the potential problem of overheating during the summer due to solar heat gains through the glazing, body heat {{and the use of}} computers and electric lighting. Standard solutions to the problem usually involve using energy intensive HVAC systems. The Scottish Parliament Building, however, reduces the requirements for such systems to only 20% of the accommodation by a variety of strategies. Natural ventilation is used wherever possible. A computerised management system senses the temperature {{in different parts of the}} Parliament and automatically opens windows to keep the building cool. During summer months, the building opens the windows during the night time when it is unoccupied and permits the heavy concrete floors and structure to cool and rid themselves of heat absorbed during the day. This then helps to keep the building temperature down during <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>by</b> absorbing the excess heat from the glazing, occupants and electrical equipment. Some of the concrete floors are further cooled by water from 25metres (80ft) deep bore holes beneath the parliamentary campus which also provide water for the toilet facilities. The building achieves the highest rating in the Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM).|$|E
