A {{subject with}} most of these planets in <b>this</b> <b>hemisphere</b> {{will need to be}} very diplomatic in order to keep those around him on their side. They may be looked after in some way by others, or else spend their lives supporting and motivating others. When the majority of planets are in the 6th, 7th and 8th houses he or she will use their energy to fulfil the needs to others. The subject may bring about a situation of being needed by bringing a number of children into the world to love and care for.|$|E
25|$|Eastern {{hemisphere}} The 10th, 11th, 12th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd houses. A subject who {{has most}} {{of his or her}} planets in <b>this</b> <b>hemisphere</b> will be a self-starter who chooses their own path through life and sets their own boundaries. They are not happy being a burden to other people, or being kept by someone else. They also have the burden themselves of being an initiator at work and in their personal life, as little is likely to be done for them by others. When the planets are in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd houses, the subject is likely to be very self-absorbed and convinced that his or her own opinions are the only ones that matter.|$|E
25|$|The {{atmosphere}} of Uranus is calm {{compared to those}} of other giant planets. Only a limited number of small bright clouds at middle latitudes in both hemispheres and one Uranus Dark Spot have been observed since 1986. One of those bright cloud features, located at −34° of latitude and called Berg, probably existed continuously since at least 1986. Nevertheless, the Uranian atmosphere has rather strong zonal winds blowing in the retrograde (counter to the rotation) direction near the equator, but switching to the prograde direction poleward of ±20° latitude. The wind speeds are from −50 to −100m/s at the equator increasing up to 240m/s near 50° latitude. The wind profile measured before the equinox of 2007 was slightly asymmetric with winds stronger in the southern hemisphere, although {{it turned out to be}} a seasonal effect as <b>this</b> <b>hemisphere</b> was continuously illuminated by the Sun before 2007. After 2007 winds in the northern hemisphere accelerated while those in the southern one slowed down.|$|E

25|$|The {{uncertainty}} in COROT-7b mass {{does not allow}} precise modelling of the planet structure. Nevertheless, educated guesses could still be put forth. Assuming a 5-Earth-masses planet, the planet was modeled to have convection in the mantle with a small core {{with no more than}} 15% the mass of the planet, or 0.7 M⊕. The lower mantle above the core-mantle boundary has more sluggish convection than the upper mantle because the greater pressure causes fluids to become more viscous. The temperature of the upper convecting mantle is different {{from one side of the}} planet to the other with lateral temperature differences for downwellings up to several hundred kelvins. However, the temperature of the upwelling is unaffected by downwelling and surface temperature variations. On the permanent dayside of the tidally locked planet where the surface temperature is hot from continuously facing its sun, the surface takes part in convection, which is the evidence that all the surface of <b>this</b> <b>hemisphere</b> being covered in oceans of lava. On the permanent nightside, the surface is cool enough for the formation of the crust with pools of lava above the convective mantle with intense volcanism. The dayside of the planet has larger convection cells than the nightside. Researchers also investigated the physical state of the interior of CoRoT-7b, indicating as likely a solid iron core, thus a self-generated magnetic field should be absent on the planet.|$|E
2500|$|Because carbon uptake in the {{terrestrial}} biosphere {{is dependent on}} biotic factors, it follows a diurnal and seasonal cycle. In [...] measurements, this feature is apparent in the Keeling curve. It is strongest in the northern hemisphere, because <b>this</b> <b>hemisphere</b> has more land mass than the southern hemisphere and thus more room for ecosystems to absorb and emit carbon.|$|E

50|$|Many {{universities}} have a fiscal year which ends during the summer, both to align {{the fiscal year}} with the academic year (and, in some cases involving public universities, with the state government's fiscal year), and because the school is normally less busy during the summer months. In the northern <b>hemisphere</b> <b>this</b> is July to the next June. In the southern <b>hemisphere</b> <b>this</b> is calendar year, January to December. Some media/communication-based organizations use a broadcast calendar {{as the basis for}} their fiscal year.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIt {{is still}} unclear whether infants become {{right-handed}} because of their left-hemisphere specialization for language (through gestural communication for instance), whether they speak predominantly with their left <b>hemisphere</b> because of <b>this</b> <b>hemisphere's</b> superiority in controlling sequential actions which first results in right-handedness, or whether the two lateralization processes develop independently. To tackle this question, we followed 26 human infants from 8 to 20 months to evaluate the temporal relationship between the emergence of hand preference for grasping objects and for declarative pointing (communicative gesture). Our results show that when grasping and pointing are compared in similar conditions, with objects presented in several spatial positions, the tendency to use the right hand is significantly larger for pointing than for grasping, and both hand preferences are loosely correlated. This suggests that, {{at least at the}} age studied here, hand preferences for grasping and for declarative pointing develop relatively independently...|$|R

A {{subject with}} most {{of his or her}} planets in <b>this</b> <b>hemisphere</b> will not be too deeply affected by the actions of other people. He or she will be able to distance themselves from those around them and from public events and movements, focusing firmly on their own needs and feelings, or the general cause of humanity that is important to them. If the planets are grouped in the 8th, 9th or 12th houses, the subject will have strong spiritual needs and values. Planets grouped in the 10th house will make the subject ambitious and politically astute; while if they are in the 11th house he or she will be interested in humanitarian causes and education.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{multiple}} theories that explain {{the outcome of}} allochiria. [...] The current and most widely accepted explanation of allochiria is Hammond's Theory. [...] This theory assumes {{that there is an}} almost complete decussation of sensory fibers within the grey matter. [...] He concludes that with a lesion on one posterior side, this would reach center in the corresponding hemisphere, and thus, the sensation is then referred by <b>this</b> <b>hemisphere</b> to {{the opposite side of the}} body. Hammond goes on to say that if another unilateral lesion supervened at a different level from the first, the sensation that was previously deflected to the wrong hemisphere was now redirected by meeting with another obstacle and so arrived at its proper hemisphere. [...] Allochiria occurs equally with [...] and [...] lesions as long as they are asymmetrical. Another theory is Huber's theory which assumes that an appearance of a new lesion on the opposite side from that of the block redirecting the impulse towards its original destination. Disappearance of symptoms due to retrogression of the lesion and track are cleared.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{the legends}} above the two hemispheres (in the edition {{preserved}} at the Bibliothèque Nationale) {{which would have}} been of great interest to Carondelet: Hoc orbis Hemisphaerium cedit regi Hispaniae and Hoc orbis Hemisphaerium cedit regi Lusitaniae (<b>This</b> <b>hemisphere</b> of the globe is granted to the King of Spain/Portugal). Carondelet was the principal advisor of Charles at a time when Spain and Portugal were again debating the division of the world into two hemispheres. The 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas (and its amendments) had agreed a demarcation line that divided the Atlantic and cut through South America. Everything to the east, from Brazil to India, was Portuguese; everything to the west was Spanish. Twenty or so years later the discovery of the riches of the Moluccas (Spice Islands), {{at a time when the}} mineral wealth of South America was untapped, gave rise to a great debate as to who should possess those Islands. In 1528 Monachus presented Carondelet [...] a geographical globe which implied that the anti-meridian of the Tordesillas dividing line would clearly put the Moluccas in the [...] Spanish hemisphere. In his accompanying tract, De Orbis Situ, he said: [...] "Maximilian Transylvanus recently published a letter concerning the Moluccas islands, which exist in the sea called variously [...] the Mar del Sur, or of the Sinae, or of Syn , finally revealed to the men of our age excellently, and clearly all in the portion and dominion of the King of Spain, except for Java and Porne or Borneo, of which a part toward the west is subject to the King of Portugal, the part which faces the east being subject to the King of Spain". It is therefore no surprise that Carandolet published as widely as he could. One year later the Treaty of Zaragoza was concluded whereby Spain lost the Moluccas despite the globe of Monachus.|$|E
