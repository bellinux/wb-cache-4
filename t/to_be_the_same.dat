The 2% percent of S.grandis that overlapped with S.convallis were determined by density of the punctation in colour of the first tergum against the second.

5|$|Daspletosaurus {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be closely related to Tyrannosaurus rex, or even a direct ancestor through anagenesis. Gregory Paul reassigned D. torosus to the genus Tyrannosaurus, creating the new combination Tyrannosaurus torosus, but {{this has not been}} generally accepted. Many researchers believe Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus to be sister taxa or even <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> genus, with Daspletosaurus a more basal relative. On the other hand, Phil Currie and colleagues find Daspletosaurus to be more closely related to Tarbosaurus and other Asian tyrannosaurids like Alioramus than to the North American Tyrannosaurus. The systematics (evolutionary relationships) of Daspletosaurus may become clearer once all the species have been described.|$|E

5|$|On September27, a {{tropical}} wave entered the eastern Caribbean Sea, believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> that spawned Hurricane Isaac. It moved generally westward, and remained weak with sporadic thunderstorm activity. The wave traversed around {{the periphery of}} Hurricane Keith, and by October2, the system produced a mid-level circulation just south of western Cuba. It continued to organize, prompting a reconnaissance aircraft to investigate the area. The system lacked a surface circulation center and remained an elongated trough of low pressure. The tropical wave interacted with an approaching frontal trough, while its mid-level center turned to the northeast and made landfall near Sarasota, Florida on October4.|$|E

Analysis of a silicon wafer exposed to the solar wind in space and returned by the crashed Genesis spacecraft has shown that the Sun has a higher proportion of oxygen-16 than does the Earth. The measurement implies that an unknown process depleted oxygen-16 from the Sun's disk of protoplanetary material prior to the coalescence of dust grains that formed the Earth.|$|E

5|$|The {{southern}} boobook (Ninox boobook) is {{a species}} of owl native to mainland Australia, southern New Guinea, Timor and the Sunda Islands. Described by John Latham in 1801, it was for many years considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> species (conspecific) as the morepork of New Zealand until 1999. Its name is derived from its two-tone boo-book call. Eleven subspecies of the southern boobook are recognized, although {{there is evidence that}} four have calls and genetics distinctive enough to warrant separate species status.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically by Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis in 1853.

Joseph Ammirati and Howard Bigelow considered Cortinarius heliotropicus, described by Charles Horton Peck 1914, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> species as C.iodes after examining the holotype specimens of both. According to the nomenclatural databases MycoBank and Index Fungorum, however, Cortinarius iodes {{does not have any}} synonyms. If they are indeed the same species, the name C.iodes has priority. C.iodes is classified in the subgenus Myxacium, along with other Cortinarius species that have a slimy cap and stem.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1 {{found that}} about {{seven percent of}} the volume of Saturn's upper {{atmosphere}} is helium (compared with 11 percent of Jupiter's atmosphere), while almost all the rest is hydrogen. Since Saturn's internal helium abundance was expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as Jupiter's and the Sun's, the lower abundance of helium in the upper atmosphere may imply that the heavier helium may be slowly sinking through Saturn's hydrogen; that might explain the excess heat that Saturn radiates over energy it receives from the Sun. Winds blow at high speeds in Saturn. Near the equator, the Voyagers measured winds about 500m/s (1,100mph). The wind blows mostly in an easterly direction.|$|E

5|$|A theory, {{proposed}} by Germanist F. A.

Braun notes that the stones were raised at a Husby, a royal residence, and the names Eiríkr (Eric) and Hákon were rather rare in Sweden, but known from the royal dynasty. Önundr would be Anund Gårdske, who was raised in Russia, while Eiríkr {{would be one of the}} two pretenders named Eric, and Hákon would be Håkan the Red. These identifications of the three men Eiríkr, Hákon and Ingvarr also appear in the reference work Nordiskt runnamnslexikon (2002), where it adds that Eiríkr is also considered to appear on the Hillersjö stone and runestone U 20. It also identifies Hákon with the one who commissioned the runestones Ög 162 and Ög Fv1970;310.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone was first observed on September 1 off the southeast {{coast of the}} United States. Initially, it was believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> storm that struck Guadeloupe on the same day, though subsequent research indicated there were two separate storms. The hurricane tracked by the Bahamas while tracking generally northward, and it attained major hurricane status over the western Atlantic Ocean. As it approached the United States coastline, the hurricane was very intense, with winds estimated at over 135 mph (215 km/h) and potentially as strong as 160 mph (260 km/h), or a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Late on September 2, the hurricane made landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina and later turned to the northeast to cross the Pamlico Sound.|$|E
5|$|After an interregnum {{prompted}} by Eorpwald's assassination, Sigeberht returned from Gaul to become {{ruler of the}} East Angles. It is likely that he gained the kingdom by military means, because his prowess as a commander was later remembered. During his reign, part of the kingdom was governed by Ecgric his 'kinsman', a relationship described by the Latin term cognatus. This may mean that Ecgric was a son of Rædwald. However, the historian Steven Plunkett is amongst those that consider Ecgric <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> person as Æthelric, named in the East Anglian tally (in the Anglian collection) as a son of Eni, Rædwald's brother. Whoever the pagan Ecgric was, Sigeberht had equal or senior power while he ruled, because the influence of his religious patronage was felt throughout his kingdom.|$|E
