40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to determine the}} feasibility of using loop heat pipes to dissipate waste heat from power electronics to the skin of a fighter aircraft and examine the performance characteristics of a titanium-water loop heat pipe under stationary and elevated acceleration fields. In the past, it has been found that the boundary condition at the condenser can be a controlling factor in the overall performance of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>management</b> scheme. Therefore, the heat transfer removed from the aircraft skin has been determined by modeling the wing as a flat plate at zero-incidence {{as a function of the}} following parameters: airspeed: 0. 8 ≤ Ma∞ ≤ 1. 4; altitude: 0 ≤ H ≤ 22 km; wall temperature: 105 ≤ Tw ≤ 135 °C. In addition, the effects of the variable properties of air have been taken into account. Heat transfer due to thermal radiation has been neglected in this analysis due to the low skin temperatures and high airspeeds up to Ma∞ = 1. 4. It was observed that flight speed and altitude have a significant effect on the heat transfer abilities from the skin to ambient, with heat rejection becoming more difficult with increasing Mach number or decreasing altitude. An experiment has been developed to examine operating characteristics of a titanium-water loop heat pipe (LHP) under stationary and elevated acceleration fields. The LHP was mounted on a 2. 44 m diameter centrifuge table on edge with heat applied to the evaporator via a mica heater and heat rejected using a high-temperature polyalphaolefin coolant loop. The LHP was tested under the following parametric ranges: heat load at the evaporator: 100 ≤ Qin ≤ 600 W; heat load at the compensation chamber: 0 ≤ Qcc ≤ 50 W; radial acceleration: 0 ≤ ar ≤ 10 g. For stationary operation (az = 1. 0 g, ar = 0 g), the LHP evaporative heat transfer coefficient decreased monotonically, thermal resistance decreased to a minimum then increased, and wall superheat increased monotonically. Heat input to the compensation chamber was found to increase the evaporative heat transfer coefficient and decrease thermal resistance for Qin = 500 W. Flow reversal in the LHP was found for some cases, which was likely due to vapor bubble formation in the primary wick. Operating the LHP in an elevated acceleration environment (az = 1. 0 g, ar 3 ̆e 0 g) revealed dry-out conditions from Qin = 100 to 400 W and varying accelerations and the ability for the LHP to reprime after an acceleration event that induced dry-out. Evaporative heat transfer coefficient and thermal resistance was found not to be significantly dependent on radial acceleration. However, wall superheat was found to increase slightly with radial acceleration...|$|E

To efficiently allocate resources to research and development efforts, a tool was developed {{that can be used to}} investigate the impact <b>of</b> new <b>thermal</b> technologies on spacecraft mass. The thermal tool is presented here as part of a mass study <b>of</b> three different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>management</b> technologies. The heat pipe radiator is recommended for a thermal load below 700 W if the radiator is able to radiate to space from both sides. A heat pipe radiator radiating to space from a single side should be considered for loads at or less than 100 W given the linear data trend. Loop heat pipe and single phase pumped looped radiators should be considered for loads exceeding 700 W as their configuration allows for deployable radiators. The results indicate that for assumptions used in the paper, technologies associated with the radiator such as alternate materials are desirable above 700 W whereas improvements should focus on the pipe and face sheet materials to reduce radiator mass...|$|R
40|$|Reducing Inadvertent Perioperative Hypothermia Through Education and Protocol Provision Capstone Leader: Ashley Arrington, SRNA Baptist Health Murray State University Program of Anesthesia, Madisonville, KY Keywords: Inadvertent, Perioperative, Hypothermia, Normothermia, <b>Thermal</b> <b>Management</b> Background: Inadvertent {{perioperative}} hypothermia {{occurs as}} a result of the body’s inability to effectively regulate temperature following the induction of general anesthesia. Other factors contributing to the body’s ability to maintain normothermia include exposure to cold ambient temperatures in the operating room, infusion of cold intravenous fluids, as well as open body cavities. A consensus exists that there is a correlation between perioperative hypothermia and adverse outcomes including impaired coagulation, altered drug metabolism, post-operative wound infection as well as cardiovascular complications. Objectives: The purpose of this capstone project was to reduce the incidence of inadvertent perioperative hypothermia through education and provision of a perioperative protocol to guide clinicians in avoidance of inadvertent perioperative hypothermia. Process: CRNAs and anesthesiologists from a rural hospital in the Midwestern United States (n= 7) participated in a pretestto determine their current knowledge of inadvertent perioperative hypothermia. Education regarding inadvertent perioperative hypothermia, its adverse effects as well as <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>management</b> then followed. The participants then completed a post-test to determine the effectiveness of the educational session. The capstone leader developed a protocol and materials for use in a retrospective chart review by the hospital’s OR and anesthesia staff, to guide practice in avoidance of hypothermia in surgical patients. Outcomes: Following completion of the educational session, the CRNAs stated on the post-test that their current <b>thermal</b> <b>management</b> practice would change and the educational session was very beneficial and applicable to practice. A post-test also revealed that their knowledge of inadvertent perioperative hypothermia and <b>thermal</b> <b>management</b> <b>of</b> a surgical patient had significantly improved. The formal protocol was not implemented at the conclusion of the project, in lieu of surgical services management priority initiatives. However, the anesthesia team has retained copies of the protocol and chart review materials to prepare for planned implementation in the future...|$|R

40|$|Efficient {{lightweight}} {{power generation}} and <b>thermal</b> <b>management</b> are two important aspects for space applications. Weight {{is added to}} the space platforms due to the inherent weight of the onboard power generation equipment and the additional weight <b>of</b> the required <b>thermal</b> <b>management</b> systems. <b>Thermal</b> <b>management</b> <b>of</b> spacecraft relies on rejection of heat via radiation, a process that can result in large radiator mass, depending upon the heat rejection temperature. For some missions, it is advantageous to incorporate an active <b>thermal</b> <b>management</b> system, allowing the heat rejection temperature to be greater than the load temperature.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} and power output of a SOFC stack strongly depend on fuel composition, <b>type</b> <b>of</b> reforming process, <b>thermal</b> <b>management</b> and operating {{conditions of the}} SOFC system. To investigate the influence of these parameters and system options on stack output, a flexible SOFC test system for biogas as well as methane operation was built. The test system has a rated power output between 1 and 2 kWel and is equipped with extensive instrumentation in order to investigate heat and power balances. All system components were designed in accordance with a focused system modeling and simulation strategy. For the verification of simulation results and the analysis of operational parameters separate tests on the system's main components (stack, flexible fuel reformer, porous media afterburner) were performed in particular test rigs. The results in the final system prototype show that small SOFC systems can successfully be operated using flexible fuel processing from partial oxidation to autothermal reforming in a single setup. It {{was found that the}} power output of stack and the ability of the reformer to run in autothermal mode is a function of water content and methane concentration in the biogas. Using 30 -cell stacks based on Ducrolloy bipolar plates (Plansee S.

While this property is attractive for many applications, it also creates more stringent design bottlenecks in the areas <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>management</b> and power delivery.

As the functions of ECU in systems have increased in recent times, the number of components per unit area on its board has also risen. High board density boosts internal heat generated per unit time in ECU ambient. The generated heat induces stress and strain at the chip interconnects due to variation in the Coefficient <b>of</b> <b>Thermal</b> Expansion (CTE) and <b>thermal</b> conductivity <b>of</b> different bonded materials in the assembly. Thermal degradation impacts device’s efficiency and could become critical. The life expectancy of electronic components reduces exponentially as the operating temperature rises, thus making <b>thermal</b> <b>management</b> pivotal in electronic system reliability. Since materials’ properties vary with operating condition, material performance has become a major consideration in the design of heat dissipation mechanism in ECU.
