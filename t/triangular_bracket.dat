40|$|Objectives] This paper aims {{to solve}} the {{problems}} of the high subjectivity and low accuracy and efficiency of draft surveying relying on human visual inspection. [Methods] Radar-level oil and liquid measurement technology products are widely used in the petrochemical industry. A device is developed that uses radar to survey the draft of a boat, designed with data series optimization formulae to ensure that the data results are true and correct. At the same time, a test is designed to prove the accuracy of the results. [Results] According to the conditions of the ship,the device is composed of a radar sensor, <b>triangular</b> <b>bracket</b> and display,and is put to use in the test. [Conclusions] With 15 vessels as the research objects,the comparison experiment shows a difference in range between 0. 001 - 0. 022 meters, with an average difference rate of 0. 028 %, which meets the requirements for ship draft survey accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Non-linear large-displacement elasto-plastic {{finite element}} {{analyses}} {{are used to}} propose design recommendations for the eaves bracket of a cold-formed steel portal frame. Owing to the thinness of the sheet steel used for the brackets, such a structural design problem is not trivial as the brackets need to be designed against failure through buckling; without availability of the finite element method, expensive laboratory testing would therefore be required. In this paper, the finite element method is firstly used to predict the plastic moment capacity of the eaves bracket. Parametric studies are then used to propose design recommendations for the eaves bracket against two potential buckling modes of failure: (1) buckling of the stiffened free-edge into one-half sine wave, (2) local plate buckling of the exposed <b>triangular</b> <b>bracket</b> area. The results of full-scale laboratory tests on selected geometries of eaves bracket demonstrate that the proposed design recommendations are conservative. The use of the finite element method in this way exploits modern computational techniques for an otherwise difficult structural design problem...|$|E
