50|$|<b>Tiludronic</b> <b>acid</b> (INN; {{also known}} as tiludronate) is a bisphosphonate used for {{treatment}} of Paget's disease of bone (osteitis deformans) in human medicine. It has the tradename Skelid. In veterinary medicine, <b>tiludronic</b> <b>acid</b> is used to treat navicular disease and bone spavin in horses. Its tradenames are Tildren and Equidronate. It is approved for treatment of navicular disease and distal tarsal osteoarthritis in Europe, and was approved for treatment of navicular disease in the United States in 2014.|$|E

40|$|Introduction <b>Tiludronic</b> <b>acid</b> as a bisphosphonate has {{a strong}} {{affinity}} for bone, making difficult the assessment of its PK profile in this deep compartment on living animals. The invasive nature of sample collection remains a limiting factor. This study {{was carried out in}} order to assess a bone biopsy technique allowing the repetition of sampling {{over a long period of}} time to dose <b>tiludronic</b> <b>acid</b> in equine bone. Material and Methods Six healthy 4 - to 8 -year-old Standardbred geldings were treated with <b>tiludronic</b> <b>acid</b> 1 mg/kg in a saline infusion over 30 minutes. The horses were subjected to euthanasia on days 1, 43, 57, 92, 182 and 222 post-treatment, respectively. Bone samples (test samples and larger reference samples) were taken at 4 sites per side and per horse: the lateral aspect of the metacarpal bone III (MCIII) of the forelimb, the 13 th rib, the tuber coxae and the cuboïd bone. Test samples were taken with a 5 -mm diameter dental drill (Implanteo™, Anthogyr), while larger reference samples were taken around the drill sample sites with an osteotome. All samples were taken immediately after euthanasia. <b>Tiludronic</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations were measured by HPLC with UV detection. Results The tuber coxae was the easiest site to sample. The sample site of the MCIII was easily accessible but due to the extreme hardness of the bone, the drill sampling was technically difficult to perform. Drill samples obtained from the 13 th rib were very small, and the access more limited. Finally, the access to the cuboïd bone required considerable dissection, not performable in vivo. Extraction and dosage of <b>tiludronic</b> <b>acid</b> from the MCIII was difficult for technical reasons in most cases, in drill samples as well as in reference samples, and most (96 %) of the values obtained were considered unreliable. This was also true for some samples from the 13 th rib and from the cuboïd bone, to a lesser extent (42 % of unreliable values for both sites). Moreover, for these two sample sites, less technical problems were encountered for the extraction and dosage of <b>tiludronic</b> <b>acid</b> in drill samples than in reference samples. No extraction or dosage problem was encountered with the tuber coxae samples. The ratio of <b>tiludronic</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations in drill versus reference samples ranged from 73 % to 185 % (mean: 124 %), 65 % to 208 % (mean: 118 %), and 26 % to 110 % (mean: 62 %) respectively in the tuber coxae, 13 th rib and cuboïd bone. In all but one horse, the highest concentrations in <b>tiludronic</b> <b>acid</b> were found in the tuber coxae, while the lowest values tended to be in the cuboïd bone at any time post-treatment. <b>Tiludronic</b> <b>acid</b> was still found in all bone samples 7 months after treatment. Discussion As previously reported with other tools, the drill tested in this study should permit to conveniently perform bone biopsies in the equine tuber coxae. This biopsy site would be the most appropriate for repeated sampling to dose <b>tiludronic</b> <b>acid</b> over time. This would help to design appropriate PK/PD studies with <b>tiludronic</b> <b>acid</b> in horses. This study also further confirms the long persistence of <b>tiludronic</b> <b>acid</b> in equine bone. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Plasma {{and urine}} {{pharmacokinetics}} of tiludronate administered once daily as an intravenous bolus of 0. 1 mg/kg for ten consecutive days (group 1, n= 6) {{was compared to}} a single slow infusion of 1 mg/kg (group 2, n= 6) in healthy adult horses. Plasma samples were collected at regular intervals {{for a period of}} 16 and 7 days in groups 1 and 2 respectively. Continuous urine collection for determination of cumulative urinary excretion of tiludronate was performed during 16 and 7 days in groups 1 and 2 respectively, and over 24 -hour periods every 10 days until 60 days after the last tiludronate administration in both groups. Tiludronate concentrations were obtained in all plasma and urine samples using HPLC with UV detection. Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using a noncompartmental approach. Group 1 mean (± SD) AUCss was 3. 76 (± 0. 698) mg. h. L- 1 and group 2 mean (± SD) AUCtot was 39. 07 (± 3. 699) mg. h. L- 1. Mean (± SD) clearance (Cl) was 0. 027 (± 0. 0042) and 0. 026 (± 0. 0022) L. h- 1. kg- 1 in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Neither the dose corrected AUC (p= 0. 724) nor the Cl (p= 0. 528) were statistically different between groups. Relative plasma bioavailability (infusion versus bolus) was 103 %. Cumulative urine <b>tiludronic</b> <b>acid</b> excretion could not be compared between groups due to analytical limitations (LOQ of 0. 025 mg. L- 1), which led to numerous missing data particularly in group 1, and an inability to conduct appropriate statistical and pharmacokinetic analyses. In conclusion, both dosage rates of tiludronate were considered bioequivalent with regards to plasma pharmacokinetics. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The bisphosphonate <b>tiludronic</b> <b>acid</b> (TIL) {{presents}} anti-resorptive and anti-inflammatory {{properties and}} it has not been evaluated in the association periodontitis-diabetes mellitus (DM) to date. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of local administration of TIL on experimental periodontitis (EP) in rats with streptozotocin (STZ) -induced DM. On day 1, thirty two rats received STZ injection. The animals were divided into groups (n= 8) : DM/C (Control), DM/EP, DM/EP/TIL 1 and DM/EP/TIL 3. In groups EP, a ligature was placed around the cervical area of mandibular first molars at day 8. In groups DM/EP/TIL 1 and DM/EP/TIL 3, TIL solutions of 1 and 3 mg/kg body weight, respectively, were injected into the buccal gingival margin of mandibular first molars every other day. Animals were euthanized at day 18. Histomorphometric analyses were performed. Data were statistically analyzed (p< 0. 05). Group DM/EP/TIL 3 presented reduced alveolar bone loss and attachment loss when compared with group DM/EP (p< 0. 05). Within the limits of this study, it can be concluded that i) the local administration of TIL solutions presented a protective effect on tissue destruction in EP in diabetic rats and ii) the dosage of TIL may influence its effects. O bisfosfonato Ãcido tiludrÃnico (TIL) apresenta propriedades antirreabsortivas e anti-inflamatÃrias e ainda nÃo foi estudado na associaÃÃo periodontite-diabetes mellitus (DM). O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar os efeitos da administraÃÃo local do TIL na periodontite experimental (PE) em ratos com DM induzido por streptozotocina (STZ). No 1 Â dia, trinta e dois ratos receberam injeÃÃo de STZ. Os animais foram divididos nos grupos (n = 8) : DM/C (Controle), DM/PE, DM/PE/TIL 1 e DM/PE/TIL 3. Nos grupos PE, uma ligadura foi colocada na Ãrea cervical dos primeiros molares inferiores no 8 Â dia. Nos grupos DM/PE/TIL 1 e DM/PE/TIL 3, soluÃÃes de TIL (1 e 3 mg/kg de peso corporal, respectivamente) foram injetadas na margem gengival vestibular dos primeiros molares inferiores em dias alternados. Os animais foram submetidos Ã eutanÃsia no 18 Â dia. AnÃlises histomorfomÃtricas foram realizadas. Os dados foram estatisticamente analisados (p< 0, 05). O grupo DM/PE/TIL 3 apresentou perda Ãssea alveolar e perda de inserÃÃo reduzidas quando comparado com o grupo DM/PE (p< 0, 05). Dentro dos limites deste estudo, pode-se concluir que i) a administraÃÃo local de soluÃÃes de TIL apresentou um efeito protetor na destruiÃÃo tecidual na PE em ratos diabÃticos e ii) a dosagem de TIL pode influenciar seus efeitos...|$|E
