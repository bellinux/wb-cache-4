5|$|After the {{reshuffling}} {{process of}} the Politburo ended in the mid-to-late 1970, the Soviet leadership evolved into a gerontocracy, a form of rule in which the rulers are significantly older <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adult population.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{production}} difficulty and high price, lutetium has very few commercial uses, especially {{since it is}} rarer <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other lanthanides but is chemically not very different. However, stable lutetium {{can be used as}} catalysts in petroleum cracking in refineries and can also be used in alkylation, hydrogenation, and polymerization applications.|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot {{as the center of}} a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain, falling with distance from the hotspot, particularly at the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely explanation is that the region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chain. Another possible explanation is that the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E
50|$|Although, as {{contemporary}} critics repeatedly remarked, <b>the</b> libretti <b>of</b> Gilberts burlesques {{were more}} literate and intelligent <b>than</b> those <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genre, he nonetheless followed <b>the</b> conventional formula <b>of</b> rhyming couplets and tortuous puns, together {{with plenty of}} young actresses in tights or short dresses, which were <b>the</b> mainstays <b>of</b> Victorian burlesque.|$|R
50|$|Alasht is {{isolated}} by surrounding mountains, {{which gives}} it a cooler climate <b>than</b> <b>most</b> regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> province. It is most known for being <b>the</b> birthplace <b>of</b> Reza Shah Pahlavi, <b>the</b> founder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pahlavi dynasty.|$|R
50|$|El-Baz was {{considered}} an éminence grise, and was more influential <b>than</b> <b>most</b> members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cabinet, especially in foreign-policy matters. He was sent on sensitive missions which would be inappropriate for the Foreign Minister to undertake.|$|R
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{socio-economic}} stagnation Brezhnev {{left to the}} nation, {{there was also a}} heritage of political and personal values. When Brezhnev died he left behind a gerontocracy, a group of leaders who were significantly older <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adult population. Historians have largely agreed that Brezhnev's reign was one primarily of stagnation. However, in a poll taken in 2006, 61 percent of the people polled viewed the Brezhnev era as good for Russia.|$|E
5|$|Bryan {{believed}} that he could, if nominated, unite the disaffected behind a strong silver campaign. However, part of his strategy was to remain inconspicuous until the last possible moment at the convention. He sent letters to national convention delegates, urging them to support silver, and enclosing copies of his photograph, writings, and speeches. Jones points out that though Bryan's speaking engagements were not deemed political {{by the standards of}} 1896, by modern measurements he was far more active in campaigning for the nomination <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> better-known candidates.|$|E
5|$|Completed in 1916, the Trans-Siberian connects Moscow with Russian Pacific {{seaports}} such as Vladivostok. From the 1960s {{until the}} early 1990s the railway served as the primary land bridge between Asia and Europe, until several factors caused {{the use of the}} railway for transcontinental freight to dwindle. One factor is that the railways of the former Soviet Union use a wider rail gauge <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest of Europe as well as China. Recently, however, the Trans-Siberian has regained ground as a viable land route between the two continents.|$|E
50|$|Although he was {{an admirer}} of Édouard Manet and owned {{paintings}} by Manet, Claude Monet, Edgar Degas and Berthe Morisot, his palette was more subdued <b>than</b> that <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Impressionists, and his technique more controlled. His style, between that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conservative Paris Salon and Impressionism, has been called juste milieu, {{and he has been}} compared to Alfred Stevens, Giuseppe De Nittis, and James Tissot.|$|R
50|$|At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> each branch {{there is}} an {{inflorescence}} of {{one or a few}} flower heads. The heads are larger <b>than</b> for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species in the genus. The head contains 8-17 disc florets with 4-9 yellow ray florets around the edge.|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, <b>the</b> {{population}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper Esopus valley has more <b>than</b> doubled. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> increase comes from residential land use, which has also {{more than doubled}} as agricultural use has decreased 80%. Newer residents are primarily using the area for second homes.|$|R
5|$|It {{was freed}} of Kotte control in 1467; its {{subsequent}} rulers directed their energies towards consolidating its economic potential by maximising revenue from pearls and elephant exports and land revenue. It was less feudal <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other regional kingdoms {{on the island}} of Sri Lanka of the same period. During this period, important local Tamil literature was produced and Hindu temples were built including an academy for language advancement.|$|E
5|$|Marcinkus and {{the three}} prisoners in his group posing as Lithuanians– Tim Walenn, Henri Picard and Gordon Brettell– managed to reach a train heading towards Danzig (now Gdansk, Poland). Most likely, they {{intended}} to travel to East Prussia, cross the Lithuanian border, and somehow cross the Baltic Sea to neutral Sweden. However, officials at the Stalag had discovered the escape and began manhunts. Marcinkus and his group travelled further <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> escapees, but were captured by the Gestapo near Schneidemühl on 26 March. Marcinkus and his associates were brought to Stalag XXB and spent the night there. On the following day they were {{handed over to the}} Danzig Gestapo.|$|E
5|$|Smalls Paradise had {{no cover}} charge and stayed open longer <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> others, {{including}} the Cotton Club. At Smalls Paradise, patrons could also reserve {{a seat at the}} club by paying a yearly fee. Many regular visitors of Harlem's night clubs also found the food better at Smalls Paradise than at either The Cotton Club or Connie's Inn. While most of the night spots shut their doors between 3 and 4 am, Smalls Paradise began breakfast dances at 6 am with a floor show of up to 30 dancers and a full jazz band.|$|E
30|$|These {{are just}} two of ozone-formation’s complexities, which are greater <b>than</b> those <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other {{criteria}} pollutants. This complexity is only partially incorporated in existing impact assessment methods. Work to incorporate them further is recommended. An initial step would be to map the speciated hydrocarbon emissions as defined by [36] against the factors and units used in TRACI or ReCiPe endpoint, and to introduce more differentiated factors into ReCiPe.|$|R
40|$|Extracts of bovine dermis and {{cartilage}} inhibit <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> bovine endothelial cells more <b>than</b> that <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fibroblast types tested. Extracts of cartilage, {{a tissue}} rather resistant to invasion, inhibit <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> endothelial cells more than extracts of dermis do. Since such extracts contain antiproteolytic activity, {{it is suggested}} that <b>the</b> inhibition <b>of</b> cell growth they induce is effected by protease inhibitors native to connective tissues...|$|R

5|$|The Catlins—and {{especially}} its {{central and southern}} areas—experiences considerably higher precipitation <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South Island's east coast; heavy rain occurs infrequently, but drizzle is common and the region averages around 150days of rain per year. Rain days are spread fairly evenly throughout the year; there is no particularly rainy season in the northern Catlins, and only a slight tendency towards more autumn rain in the southwest. The average annual rainfall recorded at the Tautuku Outdoor Education Centre is about , with little variation from year to year.|$|E
5|$|The four hymns Bach {{inserted}} in the Magnificat for the Christmas vespers had a tradition in Leipzig. A setting by Bach's predecessor Kuhnau in a Christmas cantata is extant. They can be connected to scenic display of the Christmas story, representing the annunciation to the shepherds, first by one angel (A, B), then by the multitude (C), finally a cradle song (Kindleinwiegen, D). In Bach's autograph, the four movements are grouped {{at the back of}} the volume. They are written in older musical styles <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Magnificat movements.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} facade, built {{during the}} 16thcentury in the Renaissance Herrera style, is oldest {{part of the}} cathedral and was named after Juan de Herrera, architect of the El Escorial monastery in Spain. While the eastern and western facades are older <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest of the building, their third level has Solomonic columns which {{are associated with the}} Baroque period.|$|E
50|$|Angola {{is ranked}} 47 out of 55 {{countries}} on the 2010 Revenue Watch Institute’s Transparency Index, scoring 34 points on a 100 point scale. Angola scored 26 points <b>of</b> 100 on <b>the</b> 2010 Open Budget Index, a large improvement over its 2004 score of 3%, but a far lower score <b>than</b> those <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other surveyed countries, reflecting {{the fact that the}} government provides very little information to the public.|$|R

5|$|Vandersteen, liberated of {{the work}} on the daily comic, started on a comic series based on one of the novels he had read as a youth: Robert en Bertrand, the story of two Flemish tramps at the fin de siècle. The series debuted in De Standaard in 1972. The series was the first in a long time to renew the enthusiasm of Vandersteen, and the {{graphical}} quality and the stories were a lot better <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Studio production of the time.|$|E
5|$|Written by Marc Platt, this {{unsolicited}} {{story was}} submitted to script editor Robert Holmes in late 1975 {{and dealt with}} a sentient star using the Time Lord libraries {{as a means of}} invading Gallifrey. Holmes felt that it lacked action and drama, and was in need of a proper antagonist. Even so, Robert Holmes thought that Fires of the Starmind had more potential <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other amateur submissions and he encouraged Marc Platt to continue writing. Fires of the Starmind was rejected on 15 December.|$|E
5|$|Although Loder {{lost the}} Juno Award to downhere, an {{alternative}} rock band, {{she said she}} enjoyed walking down the red carpet and would never forget meeting major Canadian musicians such as Blue Rodeo and Sam Roberts; Loder {{had an opportunity to}} sing and play guitar with Blue Rodeo's Jim Cuddy at the Junos. She competed in the Juno Cup hockey game, in which, at , she was considerably shorter <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other players. Playing for the Rockers team of Juno nominees against the Greats team of former National Hockey League players, she was awarded a penalty shot after a fight with Troy Crowder. The Greats threw their sticks in her way as she took the shot, which was stopped with ease by goaltender David Francey, a Juno nominee who had been traded to the Greats.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the German, Austrian and Ottoman {{force was}} now spread from Hill 110 almost to Bir en Nuss, but with their left flank unprotected. They {{could not have}} been in good shape after {{fighting}} all the previous day in intense midsummer heat and having to remain in position overnight, far from water and harassed by British infantry. Their situation was now precarious, as their main attacking force was well past the right of the main British infantry positions; infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division was closer to the nearest enemy-controlled water source at Katia <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attacking force. Had the British infantry left their trenches promptly and attacked in a south easterly direction, von Kressenstein's force would have had great difficulty escaping.|$|E
5|$|West Creek is less {{affected}} by episodic acidification <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{rest of the}} upper Fishing Creek watershed, {{with the exception of}} Coles Creek. The pH of West Creek is at its lowest in late winter and spring, when it is typically around 6.3. During the rest of the year, it is above 7.0. The entire pH range of the creek ranges from just over 6.0 to 7.2 or 7.3. The concentration of dissolved aluminum in West Creek is under 70 micrograms per liter, considerably less than the concentration needed to kill fish. The aluminum concentration is, in fact, usually approximately zero and is often under 40 micrograms per liter. However, early in 2011, the concentration was observed twice to be nearly 60 micrograms per liter.|$|E
