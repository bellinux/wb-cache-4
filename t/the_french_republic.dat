5|$|Despite the longed-for peace, {{tensions}} grew between France {{and most}} of the First Coalition allies, either separately or jointly. Ferdinand IV of Naples refused to pay agreed-upon tribute to France, and his subjects followed this refusal with a rebellion. The French invaded Naples and established the Parthenopaean Republic. A republican uprising in the Swiss cantons, encouraged by <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Republic</b> which offered military support, led to the overthrow of the Swiss Confederation and the establishment of the Helvetic Republic. On his way to Egypt in Spring 1798, Napoleon had stopped on the Island of Malta and removed the Hospitallers from their possessions. This angered Paul, Tsar of Russia, who was the honorary head of the Order. The ongoing French occupation of Malta angered the British, who dedicated themselves to ejecting the French garrison at Valletta. The French Directory was convinced that the Austrians were conniving to start another war. Indeed, the weaker <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Republic</b> seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians, and the British actually discussed this possibility.|$|E

5|$|As {{the capital}} of France, Paris is the seat of France's {{national}} government. For the executive, the two chief officers each have their own official residences, which also serve as their offices.

5|$|Candolle's {{initiation}} to botany {{happened in}} 1794 thanks to Pierre Etienne Vaucher in Geneva. He spent then {{four years at}} the Geneva Academy, studying science and law according to his father's wishes. In 1798, he moved to Paris after Geneva had been annexed to <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Republic.</b> His botanical career began {{with the help of}} René Louiche Desfontaines, who recommended de Candolle for work in the herbarium of Charles Louis L'Héritier de Brutelle during the summer of 1798. The position elevated de Candolle's reputation and also led to valuable instruction from Desfontaines himself. de Candolle established his first genus, Senebiera, in 1799.|$|E

5|$|Europe {{had been}} in turmoil {{since the start of}} the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792. In 1797, after five years of war, <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Republic</b> subdued the First Coalition, an {{alliance}} of Austria, Prussia, Great Britain, Spain, and various Italian states. A Second Coalition, led by Britain, Austria and Russia, and including the Ottoman Empire, Portugal and Naples, was formed in 1798, but by 1801, this too had been defeated, leaving Britain the only opponent of the new French Consulate. In March 1802, France and Britain agreed to end hostilities under the Treaty of Amiens. For the first time in ten years, all of Europe was at peace.|$|E
5|$|Forster was {{not present}} in Mainz during the siege. As representatives of the Mainz National Convention, he and Adam Lux {{had been sent to}} Paris to apply for Mainz – which was unable to exist as an {{independent}} state – {{to become a part of}} <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Republic.</b> The application was accepted, but had no effect, since Mainz was conquered by Prussian and Austrian troops, and the old order was restored. Forster lost his library and collections and decided to remain in Paris.|$|E
5|$|France, {{together}} with her sister ship , was ordered on 1 August 1911 {{as part of the}} 1911 Naval Programme. She was built by the Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire in Saint-Nazaire. Her keel was laid down on 30 November 1911 and she was launched on 7 November 1912. She was commissioned as part of the Bastille Day celebrations in 1914. Almost immediately after being commissioned, she, escorted by Jean Bart, carried the President of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Republic,</b> Raymond Poincaré, on a state visit to Saint Petersburg, Russia in July 1914. They returned from Russia shortly before World War I began.|$|E

25|$|In March 1793, France also {{declared}} war on Spain, the Vendée rebels won some victories against Paris, and <b>the</b> <b>French</b> army was defeated in Belgium by Austria with <b>the</b> <b>French</b> general Dumouriez defecting to <b>the</b> Austrians: <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Republic's</b> survival was now in real danger.|$|R
50|$|The Council of the Republic (Conseil de la République) was {{the name}} of the upper house of the {{legislature}} of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> Fourth <b>Republic</b> (1946-1958).

5|$|In February 1793, amid rising {{political}} tension, <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Republic</b> {{declared war}} on Great Britain, drawing Britain into the French Revolutionary Wars. At sea, the Bay of Biscay, the Western Approaches and the English Channel all became areas of significant naval activity as French privateers sailed on raiding cruises against British merchant shipping. To augment these attacks, the French naval authorities dispatched squadrons of frigates to attack British trade routes. To counter these operations, the Royal Navy sent their own frigates to sea, sometimes in squadrons and sometimes on single patrols.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1794 the army of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Republic</b> overran the Dutch Republic. The French National Convention {{reformed}} the Dutch Republic into a revolutionary client state named the Batavian Republic. This event alarmed the government of Great Britain, erstwhile allies of the Dutch, as the Dutch Empire controlled a number of strategically important colonies in the East Indies. The key to controlling European access to the region was the Dutch Cape Colony {{on the tip of}} Southern Africa; a naval force based there could dominate the trade routes between Europe and the East Indies, in particular the economically vital links between Britain and British India.|$|E
5|$|Jean Bart {{was built}} by the Arsenal de Brest at Brest. Her keel was laid down on 15 October 1910 and was {{launched}} on 22 September 1911. She was completed on 19 November 1913 and finished her trials before World War I began the following year. Jean Bart escorted France, which was carrying the President of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Republic,</b> Raymond Poincaré, on a state visit to Saint Petersburg, Russia in July 1914. They were returning from Russia when World War I began, but made it to France without encountering German ships.|$|E

5|$|Other factors {{contributed to}} the rising {{tensions}} as well. On his way to Egypt in 1798, Napoleon had stopped on the Island of Malta and forcibly removed the Hospitallers from their possessions.

5|$|The Childers Incident of 2 January 1793 {{marked the}} opening shots between British and French forces during the French Revolutionary Wars, {{the first phase}} of a 23-year-long war between the two countries. Following the French Revolution of 1789, {{diplomatic}} relations between the Kingdom of Great Britain and <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Republic</b> had steadily deteriorated and France was in political and social turmoil. One of the strongest hotbeds of republican activity was the principal Atlantic naval base of the French Navy at Brest in Brittany, the scene of a significant mutiny in 1790.|$|E
5|$|The French Revolution of 1789, {{in which}} the French monarchy had been overthrown, worried many British landowners. France {{declared}} war on Great Britain in 1793; in the war attempt, George allowed Pitt to increase taxes, raise armies, and suspend the right of habeas corpus. The First Coalition to oppose revolutionary France, which included Austria, Prussia, and Spain, broke up in 1795 when Prussia and Spain made separate peace with France. The Second Coalition, which included Austria, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire, was defeated in 1800. Only Great Britain was left fighting Napoleon Bonaparte, the First Consul of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Republic.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1798, the War of the First Coalition {{had come to an}} end with French control of Northern Italy, much of the Low Countries and the Rhineland confirmed by the Treaty of Campo Formio. Of all the major European powers that had at one time allied against <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Republic,</b> only the Kingdom of Great Britain remained hostile, and the French Directory determined to end the French Revolutionary Wars by eliminating Britain. A series of invasions of the British Isles were planned, and the 28-year-old General Napoleon Bonaparte, who had defeated the Austrians in Italy the previous year, was assigned to lead the Armée d'Angleterre (Army of England) that had been assembled at Boulogne. However, the English Channel was firmly controlled by the Royal Navy and French invasion supplies, particularly of viable landing craft, were totally inadequate for the purpose.|$|E
