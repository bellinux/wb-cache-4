5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the Battle of Plataea, Herodotus tells us that rumour of <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> victory reached <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> navy, at that time off the coast of Mount Mycale in Ionia. Their morale boosted, <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> marines fought and won a decisive victory at the Battle of Mycale that same day, destroying the remnants of the Persian fleet. As soon as the Peloponnesians had marched north of the isthmus, the Athenian fleet under Xanthippus had joined up with the rest of <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> fleet. The fleet, now able to match the Persians, had first sailed to Samos, where the Persian fleet was based. The Persians, whose ships were in a poor state of repair, had decided not to risk fighting, and instead drew their ships up on the beach under Mycale. An army of 60,000 men had been left there by Xerxes, and the fleet joined with them, building a palisade around the camp to protect the ships. However, Leotychides decided to attack the camp with <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> fleet's marines. Seeing the small size of <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> force, the Persians emerged from the camp, but the hoplites again proved superior, and destroyed much of the Persian force. The ships were abandoned to the Allies, who burnt them, crippling Xerxes' sea power, and marking the ascendancy of <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> fleet.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of the}} {{offensive}} was to completely destroy <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> beachhead, with the Japanese wrongly believing that their forces were approximately {{as large as the}} combat units deployed to defend <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> positions. The Allies detected the Japanese preparations for the attack shortly after they began in early 1944, and strengthened the perimeter's defenses. None of the three Japanese forces which conducted the attack was able to penetrate far into <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> perimeter, though there was intense fighting for several positions.|$|E
5|$|Academic Andrew Price-Smith {{has made}} the {{argument}} that the virus helped tip {{the balance of power in}} the later days of the war towards <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> cause.

5000|$|In modern times, Jack {{has found}} himself chosen, against his {{knowledge}} and will, to represent <b>the</b> <b>Ally.</b> <b>The</b> phrase, [...] "a spear has no branches" [...] {{is applied to}} him often, as <b>the</b> <b>Ally</b> attempts to hone him into a lone, hardened warrior by killing those he has emotional attachments to. He later finds out <b>the</b> <b>Ally</b> has specified him as the second in line of <b>the</b> <b>Ally's</b> forces. <b>The</b> Twins have been destroyed by the Otherness and <b>the</b> <b>Ally's</b> original champion Glaeken, nicknamed the Sentinel, is old and failing. At this point, Jack {{is known as the}} Heir, because should Glaeken die, Jack will become <b>the</b> <b>Ally's</b> new champion - or leave Earth defenseless. The Nightworld series, parent to the Repairman Jack series, already names Jack as a main fighter in the cosmic war.|$|R
50|$|While <b>the</b> <b>allies</b> held <b>the</b> {{field of}} battle, both sides {{suffered}} significant casualties. The Austrians lost three generals (include Prince Frederick), <b>the</b> <b>allies</b> four. Austrian killed and wounded amounted to 4,800, {{and more than}} 1,600 horses were killed. <b>The</b> <b>allies</b> lost 1,600 killed and about 4,000 wounded.|$|R
25|$|Ironically, {{the battle}} that ended Germany's paratrooper {{operations}} had {{the opposite effect}} on <b>the</b> <b>Allies,</b> seeing <b>the</b> effectiveness of the Fallshirmjagers despite <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> having many advantages over the Germans. Convinced {{of the effectiveness of}} airborne assaults, <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> hurried to train and organize their own airborne units. The British established No.1 Parachute Training School at RAF Ringway near Manchester, which trained all 60,000 European paratroopers recruited by <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> during World War II.|$|R
5|$|After {{several months}} of stalemate, Philip finally {{advanced}} into Boeotia {{in an attempt to}} march on Thebes and Athens. Opposing him, and blocking the road near Chaeronea, was <b>the</b> <b>allied</b> Greek army, similar in size and occupying a strong position. Details of the ensuing battle are scarce, but after a long fight the Macedonians crushed both flanks of <b>the</b> <b>allied</b> line, which then dissolved into a rout.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> {{invasion}} of Sicily (July 1943) and the strategic Soviet {{victory in the}} Battle of Kursk (July–August 1943), Goebbels began {{to recognize that the}} war could no longer be won. Following <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> {{invasion of}} Italy and the fall of Mussolini in September, he raised with Hitler the possibility of a separate peace, either with the Soviets or with Britain. Hitler rejected both of these proposals.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Tsar Alexander I laid all {{the blame}} on M. I. Kutuzov, Commander-in-chief of <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> Army. However, {{it is clear that}} Kutuzov's plan was to retreat farther to the rear where <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> Army had a sharp {{advantage}} in logistics. Had <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> Army retreated further, they might have been reinforced by Archduke Charles's troops from Italy, and the Prussians might have joined the coalition against Napoleon. A French army {{at the end of her}} supply lines, in a place which had no food supplies, might have faced a very different ending from the one they achieved at the real battle of Austerlitz. This essentially was Kutuzov's successful strategy in 1812, after the Battle of Borodino.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Allies</b> {{had much}} more {{potential}} wealth they could spend on the war. One estimate (using 1913 U.S. dollars) is that <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> spent $58 billion on {{the war and the}} Central Powers only $25 billion. Among <b>the</b> <b>Allies,</b> <b>the</b> UK spent $21 billion and the U.S. $17 billion; among the Central Powers Germany spent $20 billion.|$|R

5|$|As Mikawa's force {{neared the}} Guadalcanal area, the Japanese ships {{launched}} three floatplanes for one final reconnaissance of <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> ships, {{and to provide}} illumination by dropping flares during the upcoming battle. Although several of <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> ships heard and/or observed {{one or more of}} these floatplanes, starting at 23:45 on August 8, none of them interpreted the presence of unknown aircraft in the area as an actionable threat, and no one reported the sightings to Crutchley or Turner.|$|E
5|$|At 01:44, as Mikawa's ships headed towards <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> {{northern}} force, Tenryū and Yūbari {{split from}} the rest of the Japanese column and took a more westward course. Furutaka, either because of a steering problem, or to avoid a possible collision with Canberra, followed Yūbari and Tenryū. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> northern force was about to be enveloped and attacked from two sides.|$|E

5|$|By 26 December, strong German defences had stalled Canadian {{forces in}} Ortona and British and New Zealand forces in Orsogna. Although both Ortona and Villa Grande were {{captured}} {{by the end of}} December, general exhaustion among <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> forces prevented the capture of Orsogna and an advance to Pescara. When harsh winter weather set in, it became clear to <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> commanders that no further progress would be made and General Alexander called off the offensive.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1918, the Greeks, with over 300,000 soldiers, were the single largest {{component}} of <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> army on the Macedonian front. The Greek army gave the much needed advantage to the Allies that altered the balance {{between the two sides}} on the Macedonian front. On 14 September 1918, under the command of French General Franchet d'Esperey, a combined Greek, Serbian, French and British force launched a major offensive against the Bulgarian and German army. After the first serious battle (see battle of Skra) the Bulgarian army gave up their defensive positions and began retreating towards their country. On 29 September, the armistice with Bulgaria was signed by <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> command. <b>The</b> <b>Allied</b> army pushed north and defeated the remaining German and Austrian forces. By October 1918 <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> armies had recaptured all of Serbia and were preparing to invade Hungary. The offensive was halted because the Hungarian leadership offered to surrender in November 1918, marking the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian empire. This ended the First World War since Germany lacked forces to stop the Allies from invading Germany from the south. The participation of the Greek army at the Macedonian front was one of the decisive event of the war, earning Greece a seat at the Paris Peace Conference under Venizelos.|$|E

50|$|Many Germans {{raised the}} {{practical}} objection that the Declaration would be interpreted by <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> {{as an expression}} of collective guilt, which would in turn justify harsh treatment by <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> in <b>the</b> postwar world. Most Protestants were willing to admit some degree of responsibility, provided that <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> reciprocated and admitted their own wrongdoing.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Allies</b> {{had much}} more {{potential}} wealth they could spend on the war. One estimate (using 1913 US dollars) is that <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> spent $147 billion on {{the war and the}} Central Powers only $61 billion. Among <b>the</b> <b>Allies,</b> Britain and its Empire spent $47 billion and the U.S. $27 billion; among the Central Powers, Germany spent $45 billion.|$|R
5|$|For the Germans, {{the battle}} was the final {{strategic}} offensive {{that they were able}} to launch on the Eastern Front. As <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> invasion of Sicily began Adolf Hitler was forced to divert troops training in France to meet <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> threats in the Mediterranean, rather than use them as a strategic reserve for the Eastern Front. Germany's extensive loss of men and tanks ensured that the victorious Soviet Red Army enjoyed the strategic initiative for the remainder of the war.|$|E
5|$|French {{sabotage}} by the FFI, {{together with}} <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> bombing, severed German communication lines, causing initial confusion among the troops. German field commanders {{were not able}} to communicate with Army GroupG's headquarters. Despite the hampered communications, German commanders acted independently to put measures in effect to counter <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> invasion. Directly facing the brunt of <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> landings was the German LXII Corps at Draguignan, commanded by Ferdinand Neuling. Allied paratroopers interrupted his communication lines and trapped his headquarters in the city. He therefore ordered the nearby 148th Infantry Division to counterattack against the beaches at LeMuy, just before <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> paratroopers cut him off completely. Wiese, as commander of the 19th Army, was also unable to contact Blaskowitz's Army GroupG headquarters, but implemented a plan to push <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> forces in the LeMuySaint-Raphaël region back into the sea unilaterally. With almost no mobile reserves to react against the beach landings, he ordered the commander of the 189th Infantry Division, Richard von Schwerin, to establish an ad-hoc battle group (Kampfgruppe) from all nearby units to counterattack <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> bridgeheads in this area. While vonSchwerin assembled all the men he could find, the 148th Infantry Division near Draguignan encountered heavy resistance from the FFI, which had been reinforced by British paratroopers, upsetting the plan for a swift counterattack toward the beaches.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{suggests}} that <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> ships were heavier and, by implication, less maneuverable. Their weight would further {{reduce the likelihood}} of <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> ships employing the diekplous. The source of this heaviness is uncertain; possibly <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> ships were bulkier in construction. Another suggestion is that the heaviness was caused by the weight of fully armoured hoplite marines. The Allies may have had extra marines on board if their ships were less maneuverable, since boarding would then be the main tactic available to them (at the cost of making the ships even heavier). Indeed, Herodotus refers to the Greeks capturing ships, rather than sinking them.|$|E
50|$|In the Siege of Sevastopol (1854-1855) {{underground}} fighting became immense. At first <b>the</b> <b>allies</b> began digging saps {{without any}} precautions. After {{a series of}} explosions caused by counter mine action <b>the</b> <b>allies</b> increased <b>the</b> depth of the tunnels but began to meet rocky ground and the underground war {{had to return to}} higher levels. During the siege Russian sappers dug 6.8 kilometres of saps and counter mines. During the same period <b>the</b> <b>allies</b> dug 1.3 kilometres. The Russians expended 12 tons of gunpowder in the underground war while <b>the</b> <b>allies</b> used 64 tons. These figures show that the Russians tried to create a more extensive network of tunnels and carried out better targeted attacks with only minimal use of gunpowder. <b>The</b> <b>allies</b> used outdated fuses so that many charges failed to go off. Conditions in the tunnels were severe: wax candles often went out, sappers fainted due to stale air, ground water flooded tunnels and counter mines. The Russians repulsed the siege and started to dig tunnels under <b>the</b> <b>allies</b> fortifications. <b>The</b> Russian success in the underground war was recognised by <b>the</b> <b>allies.</b> <b>The</b> Times noted that the laurels for this kind of warfare must go to the Russians.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Caxias had {{organized}} {{an assault on}} the new Paraguayan defenses which López had thrown up along the Pikysyry, south of Asunción (Paraguay's capital). This stream afforded a strong defensive position which was anchored by the Paraguay River and by the swampy jungle of the Chaco region. Caxias had a road cut through the supposedly impenetrable Chaco, located {{on the other side of}} the Paraguayan River where <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> army was camped. The Brazilian ships carried <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> troops across the river, where they moved over the road which had been finished in December. <b>The</b> <b>Allied</b> forces outflanked the Paraguayan lines and attacked from the rear.
