5|$|An eclipse is {{a natural}} phenomenon. However, in some ancient and modern cultures, solar eclipses were {{attributed}} to supernatural causes or regarded as bad omens. A total solar eclipse can be frightening {{to people who are}} unaware of its astronomical explanation, as the Sun seems to disappear during <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sky darkens in a matter of minutes.|$|E
5|$|The Vangshylla–Kjerringvik Ferry {{connected}} {{the municipalities of}} Inderøy and Mosvik across the sound Skarnsund, at the narrowest point of the Trondheimsfjord. The route operated from 1 June 1964 to 19 December 1991, when it {{was replaced by the}} Skarnsund Bridge. It was part of Norwegian National Road 755. The ferry had hourly services in each direction through most of <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> crossing took seven minutes.|$|E

5|$|Convection {{began to}} {{increase}} on July 6, {{supported on the}} basis that many showers were observed {{to the north of the}} depression. An anticyclone—a large mass of air rotating clockwise—intensified within the depression's vicinity, resulting in a tighter pressure gradient and increasing winds to the north of the center of the depression. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Cindy early on July 7, and a reconnaissance flight into the storm late during the afternoon observed maximum sustained winds of 60–65mph (95–100km/h) and a minimum pressure of 997mbar (hPa; 29.44inHg). Cindy began to curve westward late on July 7 as it reached peak intensity, with a minimum central pressure of 996mbar (hPa; 29.41inHg), and drifted due west early on July 8 as a result of a maturing surface high to its north. Steady intensification continued throughout <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> storm attained hurricane status during the morning of July 8.|$|E
5|$|Hannah {{commanded}} RAAF Station Amberley, Queensland, in 1949–50, and saw service {{during the}} Malayan Emergency as senior air staff officer at , Singapore, from 1956 to 1959. His other post-war appointments included Deputy Chief of the Air Staff from 1961 to 1965, Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Operational Command from 1965 to 1967, and AOC Support Command from 1968 to 1969. In January 1970, {{he was promoted}} to air marshal and became Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), the RAAF's senior position. Knighted in 1971, Hannah concluded his three-year appointment as CAS a year early, in March 1972, to become Governor of Queensland. He attracted controversy in this role after making comments critical of the Federal government of <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> British government refused to agree to his term being extended. Hannah retired in March 1977, and died the following year.|$|E
5|$|Leading all Tech {{receivers}} was Josh Morgan, {{who caught}} eight passes for 55yards and a touchdown. Eddie Royal {{also had an}} excellent game for the Hokies, catching twolong passes of 18yards and 11yards on subsequent plays in the second quarter. Royal's 2catches drove the Hokies deep into Boston College territory, setting up a 13-yard touchdown pass to Josh Hyman that tied the game at halftime. Royal's biggest play, however, came halfway through the fourth quarter when he caught the go-ahead touchdown pass from Sean Glennon. The 24-yard reception was Royal's longest catch of <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> touchdown gave the Hokies a lead they would not relinquish {{for the rest of}} the game.|$|E

5|$|The 10th SS Panzer Division {{launched}} its attack behind schedule at 1430. Following clashes {{earlier in the}} day the British were waiting but after five hours of battle, the Scottish infantry defending Gavrus had been pushed back into a pocket around the bridge, north of the village. An artillery bombardment caused the Germans to withdraw but the British did not reoccupy the village. Moving towards Hill 113, the 2nd Grenadier Battalion, Panzergrenadier Regiment 21 and 2nd Battalion, Panzer Regiment 10 of 10th SS Panzer ran into the 44th Battalion The Royal Tank Regiment and 2nd Battalion (The King's Royal Rifle Corps) in Évrecy, who thwarted their attempt to occupy the hill. Dealing with this obstacle took the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> attack on Hill 112 was postponed. The Germans claimed the destruction of 28 tanks while the British recorded the loss of 12.|$|E
5|$|The captain {{ordered the}} ship {{abandoned}} later in <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> carrier was still afloat in the evening, albeit {{with a slight}} list to port and down by the bow. Over {{the next couple of}} days, more compartments in the ship flooded and she settled {{on the bottom of the}} harbor. Another attack on 28 July hit her several more times and the resulting damage from those hits and more near-misses to port caused the ship to list further to port. This gradually increased through the next day until Amagi capsized at 10:00 on the morning of 29 July with part of her flight deck falling overboard. The losses among the ship's crew are unknown, but were supposedly light.|$|E

5|$|The new Serjeants {{would give}} a feast to celebrate, and gave out rings to their close friends and family to mark the occasion.

Serjeant's Inn and the Inns of Court were not big enough for such an occasion, and Ely Place or Lambeth Palace would instead be used. The feasts gradually declined in importance, and by the 17th century they were small enough {{to be held in}} the Inns. The last recorded feast was in 1736 in Middle Temple, when fourteen new Serjeants were raised to the Coif.|$|E

5|$|The system {{weakened}} into {{a tropical}} storm by October 14 but restrengthened into a Category 1 hurricane by October 16. As the hurricane began to turn northeastward, it continued to intensify, attaining Category 3 status by October 17. The hurricane continued to approach Havana during <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hurricane's center passed east of Havana during the evening. The following morning, the hurricane was located over southern Florida moving northeastward, and passed east of the coast of South Carolina. The hurricane began to weaken as it was forced to curve south-southwestward, striking Florida again {{as the result of}} a high-pressure area. The system eventually weakened to a tropical depression over Florida, and traced southwestward into the Gulf of Mexico. On October 23, the remnants of the hurricane struck Central America and dissipated on October 23.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Cyclone Emma {{originated}} {{from an area}} of low pressure that formed to the southeast of Java on 22 February 2006. Over the following few days, a monsoonal trough developed over the Timor Sea, leading to an increased likelihood of tropical cyclone formation from the initial low within several days. On 25 February, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology began monitoring the system as a tropical low. The low tracked slowly towards the south throughout <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> centre of circulation relocated farther south late on 26 February. By this time, the Bureau of Meteorology anticipated the low to develop into a tropical cyclone and attain winds of 95km/h (60mph 10-minute sustained) before moving over land in Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|The first {{attack on}} Île de la Passe was {{launched}} {{on the evening}} of 10 August, with Staunch towing boats carrying over 400 soldiers, Royal Marines and volunteer sailors to the island under cover of darkness, guided by Nereides pilot. During the night however, the pilot became lost and the boats were scattered in high winds and had not reassembled by dawn. To distract French attention from the drifting boats, Pym directed Captain Henry Lambert in Iphigenia to sail conspicuously off Port Napoleon, where {{the main body of the}} French squadron, led by Hamelin in Vénus, was based. Pym joined Lambert later in <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> frigates subsequently returned to the waters of Grand Port by different routes, confusing French observers from the shore as to British intentions. By 13 August, the boats originally intended for the attack had still not been assembled and Pym decided that he could not risk waiting any longer without the French launching a counterattack. Launching his own boats at 8:00 pm, guided by the pilot and commanded by Pym's second in command, Lieutenant Norman, Pym's marines and sailors landed on the island in darkness under heavy fire from the defenders. Norman was killed in the initial exchange of fire, but his deputy, Lieutenant Watling, seized the island by storming the fortifications surrounding the battery. Seven British personnel were killed and 18 wounded in the battle, in which the storming party managed to seize intact French naval code books and took 80 prisoners. Willoughby was furious that Pym had assumed command of the operation without his permission and the officers exchanged angry letters, part of an ongoing disagreement between them that engendered mutual distrust.|$|E

5|$|The match {{began in}} similar fashion to the earlier contest; the Non-Smokers won the toss, and their captain Arthur Shrewsbury chose to bat first. The Smokers, led by the Australian Harry Boyle, walked onto the pitch smoking cigars. Despite the strong bowling attack boasted by the Smokers, which {{included}} Johnny Briggs and George Lohmann, the Non-Smokers took advantage of a good batting wicket and accrued 196 runs before the first wicket fell, that of William Bruce for 131. Billy Bates was dismissed shortly thereafter for four, bringing in Billy Gunn. Shrewsbury and Gunn batted together {{for the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> following morning, building a partnership of 310 runs; Shrewsbury was eventually caught off the bowling of Briggs for 236, while Gunn was bowled by Boyle for 150. Fifties from Richard Houston, Harry Musgrove and Jack Worrall in the middle-order boosted the score to 803, a new record for the highest innings total in first-class cricket. The previous record, 775 runs, had also been set in Australia, by New South Wales. The score fell some way short of the highest innings score in any cricket, which was believed to have been the 920 scored by Orleans Club against Rickling Green in 1882. The score has since been surpassed over twenty times.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, England's bowlers {{continued}} to make regular inroads. Ward fell in the third over of <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> debutant Lindsay Hassett was dismissed soon after, leaving Australia at 5/150. McCabe, who had hit two boundaries thus far in the morning, was joined by Jack Badcock. The former {{continued to}} score boundaries regularly, and hit Sinfield for four and three from a leg glance and late cut to reach his 50 in 90 minutes. He then hit Hammond for consecutive on-driven fours before Badcock fell at 6/194, having made only 9 of the 43 runs in their partnership. McCabe had struck 62 of the 83 runs added since {{he had come to}} the crease. With all the other specialist batsmen dismissed, McCabe was now batting with wicket-keeper Ben Barnett and began to attack the English bowlers with powerful drives and hook shots. Hammond brought back Farnes to try and finish off the tail, but McCabe responded by hitting three fours in one over, forcing the English captain to remove his fast bowler after McCabe had hooked him for six.|$|E
5|$|This new sail {{was much}} larger than the others sighted earlier in <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{detached}} squadron abandoned their former pursuit and turned towards the new arrival, Hercule. By 17:45, L'Héritier was in full flight with the British force strung out behind him, the rest of Bridport's fleet far to the west. Jason had the lead with Mars shortly behind, although Inman on Ramillies had lost his fore topmast and had dropped back. Hood, an experienced officer and a nephew of both Bridport and the veteran Admiral Lord Hood, pressed his ship forwards and gradually gained on both Jason and Hercule. L'Héritier knew that in open water he would be caught and overwhelmed, and sought instead to escape through the narrow and dangerous channel of the Raz de Sein, a rocky passage between the Île de Sein and the Pointe du Raz: during the Expédition d'Irlande the French ship of the line Séduisant had been wrecked in the Raz de Sein with 680 lives.|$|E
