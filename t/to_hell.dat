5|$|Final Damnation: Finally, {{those who}} persist in {{living in a}} state of mortal sin and do not repent before death subject {{themselves}} <b>to</b> <b>hell,</b> an everlasting separation from God. The Church teaches that no one is condemned <b>to</b> <b>hell</b> without having freely decided to reject God. No one is predestined <b>to</b> <b>hell</b> and no one can determine with absolute certainty who has been condemned <b>to</b> <b>hell.</b> Catholicism teaches that through God's mercy a person can repent at any point before death, be illuminated with the truth of the Catholic faith, and thus obtain salvation. Some Catholic theologians have speculated that the souls of unbaptised infants and non-Christians without mortal sin but who die in original sin are assigned to limbo, although this is not an official dogma of the Church.|$|E

La Resistance forms a human shield while Kyle tries to persuade the army and his mother against killing the two.

Satan then grants Kenny a wish; Kenny asks for everything to return to how {{it was before the}} war, even though it means he will have to go back <b>to</b> <b>Hell.</b> He takes off his hood to say goodbye to his friends, but instead of returning <b>to</b> <b>Hell,</b> Kenny ascends to Heaven due to his act of sacrifice. Everything returns to normal in South Park.|$|E

5|$|Audie Murphy (20 June 1925 – 28 May 1971) was {{a highly}} {{decorated}} American soldier and Medal of Honor recipient who turned actor. He portrayed himself in the film <b>To</b> <b>Hell</b> and Back, the account of his World War II experiences. During the 1950s and 1960s he was cast primarily in westerns. While often the hero, he proved his ability to portray a cold-blooded hired gun in No Name on the Bullet. A notable exception to the westerns was The Quiet American in which he co-starred with Michael Redgrave. Murphy made over 40 feature films and often worked with directors more than once. Jesse Hibbs who directed <b>To</b> <b>Hell</b> and Back worked with the star on six films, only half of which were westerns. When promoting his 1949 book <b>To</b> <b>Hell</b> and Back he appeared on the radio version of This Is Your Life. To promote the 1955 film of the same name, he appeared on Ed Sullivan's Toast of the Town. He was a celebrity guest on television shows such as What's My Line? and appeared {{in a handful of}} television dramas. Murphy's only television series Whispering Smith had a brief run in 1961. For his cooperation in appearing in the United States Army's Broken Bridge episode of The Big Picture television series he was awarded the Outstanding Civilian Service Medal.|$|E

McFarlane Toys released two toy lines, one in 1998 {{and the other in}} 2002. The first was a figure of Jason from Jason Goes <b>to</b> <b>Hell,</b> and the other was of Über-Jason from Jason X. Since McFarlane's last toy line in 2002, there has been a steady production of action figures, dolls, and statuettes. These include tie-ins with the film Freddy vs. Jason (2003).
