In total, Lynx helicopters flew nearly 600sorties during <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>War,</b> while their crews and engineers maintained flying rates three times their norm.|$|E

A-10s also shot down two Iraqi helicopters with the GAU-8 cannon. The first of these was shot down by Captain Robert Swain over Kuwait on 6 February 1991 for the A-10's first air-to-air victory. Four A-10s were shot down during the war, all by surface-to-air missiles. Another two battle-damaged A-10s and OA-10As returned to base but were written off, some sustaining additional damage in crash landings.
