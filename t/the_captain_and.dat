5|$|A naval {{board of}} inquiry was {{appointed}} shortly afterwards that determined {{the cause of}} the collision was of a lack of seamanship by <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>and</b> watch officers of the ship. The Justice Minister, Kobie Coetsee, subsequently introduced a retrospective change in law to allow him to hold an inquest into the death of the only crewman whose body was found. The inquest lasted a year and apportioned blame on <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>and</b> PWO.|$|E
5|$|A {{wrongful}} death lawsuit was {{filed by the}} families {{of three of the}} victims in Los Angeles. After a jury found <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>and</b> Avjet Corporation negligent, an out-of-court settlement was reached, where Avjet agreed to pay the plaintiffs a total of US$11.7M in damages. There were reportedly also other settlements for other victims.|$|E
5|$|Loading and {{unloading}} a bulker is {{time-consuming and}} dangerous. The process is planned by the ship's chief mate under {{the direct and}} continued supervision of ship's captain. International regulations require that <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>and</b> terminal master agree on a detailed plan before operations begin. Deck officers and stevedores oversee the operations. Occasionally loading errors are made that cause a ship to capsize or break in half at the pier.|$|E

5|$|The captain {{asked for}} the descent {{checklist}} at 20:24:24. The fasten seat belt sign was switched on and the flight attendant started the process of preparing the cabin for landing. At 20:24:46 the captain, {{as part of the}} checklist, informed the first officer that they would go down to 1,500 ft at Torghatten and then down to 550ft. This was followed first by a partially unreadable conversation between <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>and</b> the first officers, which included if they were to fill fuel, and then an unreadable conversation between <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>and</b> the jump seat passenger.

Luke's struggle for supremacy peaks when he leads a work crew in a seemingly impossible but successful effort to complete a road-paving job in less than one day. The other prisoners start to idolize him after he makes and wins a spur-of-the moment bet that he can eat fifty hard-boiled eggs in one hour.|$|E
5|$|After {{the slave}} ship reached port at Black River, Jamaica, Zongs owners made {{a claim to}} their {{insurers}} {{for the loss of}} the slaves. When the insurers refused to pay, the resulting court cases (Gregson v Gilbert (1783) 3 Doug. KB 232) held that in some circumstances, the deliberate killing of slaves was legal and that insurers could be required to pay for the slaves' deaths. The judge, Lord Chief Justice, the Earl of Mansfield, ruled against the syndicate owners in this case, due to new evidence being introduced suggesting <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>and</b> crew were at fault.|$|E

5|$|At this point, the {{remainder}} of the series was under threat. Jardine was shaken by the events and by the hostile reactions to his team. Stories appeared in the press, possibly leaked by the disenchanted Nawab of Pataudi, about fights and arguments between the England players. Jardine offered to stop using bodyline if the team did not support him, but after a private meeting (not attended by Jardine or either of the team managers) the players released a statement fully supporting <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>and</b> his tactics. Even so, Jardine would not have played in the fourth Test without the withdrawal of the unsportsmanlike accusation.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{minutes into}} the flight, the hijackers injured at least three people (possibly killing one), {{forcibly}} breached the cockpit, and overpowered <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>and</b> first officer. Atta, an al-Qaeda member and licensed commercial pilot, took over the controls. Air-traffic controllers noticed the flight was in distress when the crew was no longer responding. They realized the flight had been hijacked when Mohamed Atta's announcements for passengers were transmitted to air traffic control. On board, flight attendants Amy Sweeney and Betty Ong contacted American Airlines, and provided information about the hijackers and injuries to passengers and crew.|$|E
5|$|For ease of {{training}} and fleet conversion, de Havilland designed the Comet's flight deck layout {{with a degree of}} similarity to the Lockheed Constellation, an aircraft that was popular at the time with key customers such as BOAC. The cockpit included full dual-controls for <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>and</b> first officer, while a flight engineer controlled various key systems, including fuel, air conditioning, and electrical systems.

5|$|In {{addition}} to her passengers and cargo, De Soto also acted as a conduit for news between Cuba and the United States. Most of the news conveyed by De Soto was of a mundane characterfor example, reports of activity on the Havana sugar marketbut sometimes it was of more interest. In October 1860 for instance, De Soto reported the interception at Sierra Morena, Cuba of an illegal slave ship carrying 800 African slaves. <b>The</b> <b>captain</b> <b>and</b> crew of the slave ship were detained by local authorities, but about 400 of the slaves had already been dispersed ashore {{and could not be}} retrieved.|$|E
5|$|In {{the centre}} of the castle is the keep, which has an {{external}} diameter of , an octagonal lower storey and circular walls on the upper levels. Originally this held accommodation for <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>and</b> the garrison, but it was heavily redeveloped in the 19th and 20th centuries. Its exterior walls have eight recesses at ground level, originally used to store ammunition for the castle's guns. The basement of the keep was redesigned in the 1890s, when electrical generators were installed, protected by a new, thicker, concrete ceiling. It may originally have been vaulted in stone in a similar style to nearby Hurst Castle.|$|E

5|$|The NZRFU named Gallaher captain for the tour, with Billy Stead as vice-captain. A week {{into the}} voyage to Britain aboard the SS Rumutaka, rumours {{circulated}} {{that some of}} the southern players were unhappy with the appointment of Gallaher, and with what they perceived as an Auckland bias in the squad. The dissidents contended that <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>and</b> vice-captain should have been elected by the players, as they had been on the 1897 and 1903 tours to Australia. Gallaher recognised the damage factionalism might do to the team and offered to resign, as did the vice-captain Stead. Although the teams' manager refused to accept the resignations, the players still took a vote—17 out of 29 endorsed the NZRFU's selections.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} made a stop-over at Namsos, where sixteen of {{the passengers}} disembarked. This {{reduced the number of}} passengers on board to thirty-three, but the passenger occupying the jump seat continued to sit there on the next leg. The captain was the flying pilot for the segment. The aircraft departed Namsos at 20:07 and contacted Trondheim Air Traffic Control Center (ATCC) at 20:13 to receive permission to ascend to flight level 90 (FL 90), which was received. During the flight, the passenger in the jump seat held a conversation with <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>and</b> asked several questions regarding the operations. The first officer did not participate in this discussions, and it was he who conducted radio contact with air traffic control and the airline's operations' center.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>captain</b> <b>and</b> most of {{the crew}} of the shipall {{nationals}} of the Philippineshad to face a U.S. Coast Guard Board of Inquiry, which required them to remain in the United States for several weeks after the wreck. In addition, a federal grand jury investigated the incident for criminal wrongdoing. Captain Morgado refused to answer many of the questions posed at the inquiry, citing his Fifth Amendment rights. The crew was released after their testimony and returned to the Philippines. On September 16, the Coast Guard issued its findings that captain's error was the primary cause of the wreck, with the first and third officers of the ship also partly responsible. The investigation found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing, and no charges were filed against any member of the New Carissa crew.|$|E
