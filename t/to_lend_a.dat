5|$|The Adenhart family {{created the}} Nick Adenhart Memorial Fund, which is {{designed}} to provide financial support to youth baseball organizations. The goal is <b>to</b> <b>lend</b> <b>a</b> helping hand to struggling leagues around the country to buy equipment and cover expenses to keep youth baseball functioning. The first presentation from the fund was for $5000 to the Halfway Little League in Halfway, Maryland. Two annual events, the Nick Adenhart 5K Run and Walk and the Nick Adenhart Baseball Camp, have been established to benefit the foundation.|$|E
5|$|Arrington and {{his assistants}} were {{supported}} {{by a team of}} editors, administrative assistants, research historians, oral history experts, and student interns. It was common for many individuals to work on a project; generally the principle author was listed in the article's byline, but sometimes Arrington's name was used <b>to</b> <b>lend</b> <b>a</b> publication authority. As a supervisor, Arrington was not a skillful bureaucrat, and junior staffers complained about their exclusion from decision-making and a lack of communication, which Arrington tried to ameliorate. Richard Bushman, a prominent Mormon historian, suggested that Arrington commission a multivolume history of the church, written mostly by scholars outside the history division staff. William Hartley, Gordon Irving, and Gary Shumway began an oral history program, funded {{by a grant from the}} descendants of James Moyle, a Utah politician. A summer research fellowship offered $1000 for outside scholars to use the LDS Church Archives for projects on Mormon history. Eugene England Sr. also donated money to support projects that Arrington deemed especially important. Additionally, a special Mormon History Trust Fund was formed from individual donations, including royalties donated by staff members.|$|E
5|$|The canal company {{exhausted}} {{its capital}} of £8 million in 4 years, when {{only half the}} construction work was completed. To avoid bankruptcy they appealed for funds to Manchester Corporation, which set up a Ship Canal Committee. On 9 March 1891 the corporation decided, on the committee's recommendation, to lend the necessary £3 million, to preserve the city's prestige. In return the corporation was allowed to appoint five of the fifteen {{members of the board}} of directors. The company subsequently raised its estimates of the cost of completion in September 1891 and again in June 1892. An executive committee was appointed as an emergency measure in December 1891, and on 14 October 1892 the Ship Canal Committee resolved <b>to</b> <b>lend</b> <b>a</b> further £1.5million on condition that Manchester Corporation had an absolute majority on the canal company's board of directors and its various sub-committees. The corporation subsequently appointed 11 of the 21 seats, nominated Alderman Sir John Harwood as deputy director of the company, and secured majorities on five of the board's six sub-committees. The cost to Manchester Corporation of financing the Ship Canal Company {{had a significant impact on}} local taxpayers. Manchester's municipal debt rose by 67 per cent, resulting in a 26 per cent increase in rates between 1892 and 1895.|$|E

25|$|<b>To</b> <b>lend</b> <b>a</b> {{quantitative}} {{basis to}} {{discussions of the}} risks of transmitting deliberate messages from Earth, the SETI Permanent Study Group of the International Academy of Astronautics adopted in 2007 a new analytical tool, the San Marino Scale. Developed by Prof. Ivan Almar and Prof. H. Paul Shuch, the scale evaluates the significance of transmissions from Earth {{as a function of}} signal intensity and information content. Its adoption suggests that not all such transmissions are equal, and each must be evaluated separately before establishing blanket international policy regarding active SETI.|$|E

Queen closers appear as the second brick, and the penultimate brick in heading courses. A muted colour scheme for occasional headers is sometimes used in English bond <b>to</b> <b>lend</b> <b>a</b> subtle texture to the brickwork.

Kilichundan Mampazham, promoted as a comeback vehicle for the actor, received good reviews and a decent box-office collection. Balettan, directed by V. M. Vinu, was also a commercial success. Mohanlal {{played the role of}} Athanipparambil Balachandran, a bank employee always willing <b>to</b> <b>lend</b> <b>a</b> helping hand to others, who is forced to hide many secrets after his father's death leading to his family's mistrust. In 2004, Natturajavu was his only commercial success and Mambazhakkalam became a hit.|$|E

Foodstuffs were collected by a nationwide campaign of Kızılay (Turkish Red Crescent) and the operation was mainly funded by the American Greek War Relief Association and the Hellenic Union of Constantinopolitans. Food supplies were sent to the port of Istanbul to be shipped to Greece. SS Kurtuluş was prepared for her voyage with big symbols of the Red Crescent painted on both sides.|$|E

25|$|The board {{insisted that}} Thomson join the 1858 cable-laying expedition, without any {{financial}} compensation, and {{take an active}} part in the project. In return, Thomson secured a trial for his mirror galvanometer, about which the board had been unenthusiastic, alongside Whitehouse's equipment. However, Thomson found the access he was given unsatisfactory and the Agamemnon had to return home following the disastrous storm of June 1858. Back in London, the board was on the point of abandoning the project and mitigating their losses by selling the cable. Thomson, Cyrus West Field and Curtis M. Lampson argued for another attempt and prevailed, Thomson insisting that the technical problems were tractable. Though employed in an advisory capacity, Thomson had, during the voyages, developed a real engineer's instincts and skill at practical problem-solving under pressure, often taking the lead in dealing with emergencies and being unafraid <b>to</b> <b>lend</b> <b>a</b> hand in manual work. A cable was finally completed on 5 August.|$|E
25|$|Her first work A View of Religion, was {{published}} in 1784, and a second and enlarged edition in 1791. The emolument she derived from this not only placed her in a comfortable situation, but enabled her to pay the debts she had contracted during her and her sister's illness, and <b>to</b> <b>lend</b> <b>a</b> small sum at interest. In 1799, she published A Summary History of New England, from the settlement at Plymouth {{to the adoption of}} the Federal Constitution. In gathering materials for this work, among old manuscripts, she seriously impaired her eyesight, and had to employ an amanuensis to prepare the copy for the printers. Her most elaborate work, The History of the Jews since the destruction of Jerusalem, was in 1818 reprinted in London, at the expense and {{for the benefit of the}} London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews. She started an autobiography, which {{was published}} after her death by Hannah Farnham Sawyer Lee. During the later years of her life, she enjoyed a comfortable annuity, raised by her friends.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the film, the {{cinematography}} made {{extensive use}} of shadows and close up shots to emphasise the moods of the characters. Jump cuts were frequently used as well. Overall, 8,230 metres of film negative was {{used to make the}} film, and the team incurred a cost of [...] 20,000 for exterior shooting equipment. The scenes where Arun interviewed women for his documentary were real scenes, improvised with women they would meet at colleges and bus stops, and shot using the live-recording method. The film uses a sharp contrast of black and white colours <b>to</b> <b>lend</b> <b>a</b> surreal atmosphere to it, and no makeup was used for the lead actors.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, {{reflecting}} the transformation from script to screen, Dana Stevens of Slate disagrees with Gleiberman's {{suggestion that the}} [...] "film makes you think" [...] and argues that the film's [...] "eagerness" [...] to [...] "drag" [...] the audience [...] "through the lower depths of human experience" [...] leaves little space for independent [...] "conclusions". Stevens noted that while the film is about improvement and self-actualization, [...] "it wields an awfully large cudgel" [...] in contrast to Scott's view of balance: [...] "unsparing force (though not in overly graphic detail)". Perhaps sharing Mathews' view regarding the daunting challenge of adapting the harsh story of Push, Stevens' observes that [...] "Daniels and Fletcher no doubt intended for their film <b>to</b> <b>lend</b> <b>a</b> voice {{to the kind of}} protagonist too often excluded from American movie screens: a poor, black, overweight single mother from the inner city." ...|$|E

500|$|Concept artist Tully Summers {{commented on}} Nolan's style of {{cinematography}} {{when asked about}} the difference between his designs for this film and fantasy-based designs for Men in Black 3: [...] "The difference for me was Christopher Nolan's visual style. One {{of the things that makes}} his Batman movies so compelling is their tone of plausibility. He will often prefer a raw, grittier design over one that is very sleek and product design pretty. It's sort of a practical military aesthetic. This stuff is made to work, not impress shoppers. The Dark Knight Rises is a war film." [...] Producer Emma Thomas stated this Batman film has a different visual aesthetic from the first two Nolan-directed features, explaining that [...] "it's meant to be winter in Gotham, so that right there is going <b>to</b> <b>lend</b> <b>a</b> whole different look to the film." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2003, Warner Bros. hired Memento {{director}} Christopher Nolan {{to direct}} an untitled Batman film, and David S. Goyer {{signed on to}} write the script two months later. Nolan stated his intention to reinvent the film franchise of Batman by [...] "doing the origins story of the character, which is a story that's never been told before". Nolan said that humanity and realism would {{be the basis of}} the origin film, and that [...] "the world of Batman is that of grounded reality. [...] will be a recognizable, contemporary reality against which an extraordinary heroic figure arises." [...] Goyer said that the goal of the film was to get the audience to care for both Batman and Bruce Wayne. Nolan felt the previous films were exercises in style rather than drama, and described his inspiration as being Richard Donner's 1978 film Superman, in its focus on depicting the character's growth. Also similar to Superman, Nolan wanted an all-star supporting cast for Batman Begins <b>to</b> <b>lend</b> <b>a</b> more epic feel and credibility to the story.|$|E

[...] Mozart was temporarily exiled from the Whiskers group several times for having pups. [...] Her first eviction came part way through the first series and lasted only one episode. [...] Her second eviction in the next series was ended by her miscarrying. Near {{the end of the second}} series, Mozart again became pregnant, and then made the unusual move of evicting her sister Daisy from the Whiskers. Flower led the Whiskers to a new home and left Mozart alone at the burrows with her newborn pups, effectively evicting her.
