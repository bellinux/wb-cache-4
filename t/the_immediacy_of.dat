5|$|Following {{a largely}} organic and uncalculated impulse, {{many of these}} new bands infused classic heavy metal with <b>the</b> <b>immediacy</b> <b>of</b> pub rock and the {{intensity}} of punk rock, implementing to various degrees the crossover of genres started by Motörhead; in general they shunned ballads, de-emphasised harmonies and produced shorter songs with fast tempos and a very aggressive sound based on riffs and power chords, featuring vocals ranging from high pitched wails to gruff and low growls. Iron Maiden, Angel Witch, Saxon, Holocaust, Tygers of Pan Tang, Girlschool, Tank and More are notable performers of this style, which bands such as Atomkraft, Jaguar, Raven and Venom stretched to produce even more extreme results. Critics consider this new approach to heavy metal the greatest musical accomplishment of the NWOBHM and an important evolutionary step for the genre.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{sought to}} erect a new {{building}} to address the increasingly cramped conditions of the original Boylston Street campus located near Copley Square, in the increasingly fashionable and crowded Back Bay neighborhood of Boston. Because the stipulations of the original land grant prevented MIT from covering more than two-ninths of its current lot, Walker announced his intention to build the industrial expansion on a lot directly across from the Trinity Church fully intending that expected opposition would lead to favorable terms for selling the proposed land and funding construction elsewhere. With the financial health of the Institute only beginning to recover, Walker began construction on the partially-funded expansion, fully expecting <b>the</b> <b>immediacy</b> <b>of</b> the project to be a persuasive tool for raising its funds. The strategy was only partially successful, as the 1883 building had laboratory facilities that were second-to-none but also lacked the outward architectural grandeur of its sister building and was generally considered an eyesore on its surroundings. Mechanical shops were {{moved out of the}} original Rogers Building in the mid-1880s to accommodate other programs, and in 1892 the Institute began construction on another Copley Square building.|$|E

40|$|We model a trader’s {{decision}} {{to supply liquidity}} by submitting limit orders or demand liquidity by submitting market orders in a limit order market. The best quotes and the execution probabilities and picking off risks of limit orders determine <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> <b>immediacy.</b> <b>The</b> price <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> and <b>the</b> trader’s willingness to pay for <b>immediacy</b> determine <b>the</b> trader’s optimal order submission, with the trader’s willingness to pay for <b>immediacy</b> depending on <b>the</b> trader’s valuation for the stock. We estimate the execution probabilities and the picking off risks using a sample from the Vancouver Stock Exchange to compute <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> <b>immediacy.</b> <b>The</b> price <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> changes with market conditions — a trader’s optimal order submission changes with market conditions. We combine <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> with <b>the</b> actual order submissions to estimate the unobserved arrival rates of traders {{and the distribution of}} the traders’ valuations. High realized stock volatility increases the arrival rate of traders and increases the number of value traders arriving — liquidity supply is more competitive after periods of high volatility. An increase in the spread decreases the arrival rate of traders and decreases the number of value traders arriving — liquidity supply is less competitive when the spread widens. discrete choice; high frequency data; limit orders; liquidity; market orders...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{contribution}} is to inform for the first time, about bats that are trapped for blazingstar plants (Mentzelia hispida: Loasaceae). These plants are covered totally with hispid trichomes. The tip of the trichomes finishes in four recurved thorns, capable of embeding and fastening in the nude bat skin and impede to be freed of them, adhering it tightly. The observations were carried out while we studied the population dynamics of Leptonycteris yerbabuenae in the cave of Guano, located in <b>the</b> <b>immediacies</b> <b>of</b> San Pablo Tetlapayac, Municipality of Metztitlan, Hidalgo, Mexico, at the Biosphere Reservation of Barranca de Metztitlán (Metztitlan Canyon). During two consecutive years we found bats of the species Pteronotus personatus, Natalus stramineus, and Leptonycteris yerbabuenae trapped by blazingstar plants, without apparent possibilities to be freed, for which this circumstance was considered fatal for bats. Other bats of the species Mormoops megalophylla, Pteronotus parnelli, Pteronotus davyi, Leptonycteris nivalis, and Glossophaga soricina would be running the same danger, due to plant grows in <b>the</b> <b>immediacies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entrance of the cave where they take refuge...|$|R

25|$|Several {{experiments}} varied <b>the</b> <b>immediacy</b> <b>of</b> {{the teacher}} and learner. Generally, when the victim's physical immediacy was increased, the participant's compliance decreased. The participant's compliance also decreased when the authority's physical immediacy decreased (Experiments 1–4). For example, in Experiment 2, where participants received telephonic instructions from the experimenter, compliance decreased to 21 percent. Interestingly, some participants deceived the experimenter by pretending to continue the experiment. In the variation where the learner's physical immediacy was closest, where participants had to hold the learner's arm physically onto a shock plate, compliance decreased. Under that condition, 30 percent of participants completed the experiment.|$|E
25|$|Before 2005, donor lungs {{within the}} United States were {{allocated}} by the United Network for Organ Sharing on a first-come, first-served basis to patients on the transplant list. This {{was replaced by}} the current system, in which prospective lung recipients of age of 12 and older are assigned a lung allocation score or LAS, which takes into account various measures of the patient's health. The new system allocates donated lungs according to <b>the</b> <b>immediacy</b> <b>of</b> need rather than how long a patient has been on the transplant list. Patients who are under the age of 12 are still given priority based on how long they have been on the transplant waitlist. The length of time spent on the list is also the deciding factor when multiple patients have the same lung allocation score.|$|E

25|$|Azusa {{participants}} {{returned to}} their homes carrying their new experience with them. In many cases, whole churches were converted to the Pentecostal faith, but many times Pentecostals were forced to establish new religious communities when their experience {{was rejected by the}} established churches. One of the first areas of involvement was the African continent, where, by 1907, American missionaries were established in Liberia, as well as in South Africa by 1908. Because speaking in tongues was initially believed to always be actual foreign languages, it was believed that missionaries would no longer have to learn the languages of the peoples they evangelized because the Holy Spirit would provide whatever foreign language was required. (When the majority of missionaries, to their disappointment, learned that tongues speech was unintelligible on the mission field, Pentecostal leaders were forced to modify their understanding of tongues.) Thus, as the experience of speaking in tongues spread, a sense of <b>the</b> <b>immediacy</b> <b>of</b> Christ's return took hold and that energy would be directed into missionary and evangelistic activity. Early Pentecostals saw themselves as outsiders from mainstream society, dedicated solely to preparing the way for Christ's return.|$|E
25|$|Telugu words end in vowels {{which many}} {{consider}} a mellifluous quality and thus suitable for musical expression. Of the trinity of Carnatic music composers, Tyagaraja's and Syama Sastri's compositions were largely in Telugu, while Muttuswami Dikshitar is noted for his Sanskrit texts. Tyagaraja is remembered both for his devotion and the bhava of his krithi, a song form consisting of pallavi, (the {{first section of}} a song) anupallavi (a rhyming section that follows the pallavi) and charanam (a sung stanza {{which serves as a}} refrain for several passages in the composition). The texts of his kritis are almost all in Sanskrit, in Telugu (the contemporary language of the court). This use of a living language, as opposed to Sanskrit, the language of ritual, is in keeping with the bhakti ideal of <b>the</b> <b>immediacy</b> <b>of</b> devotion. Sri Syama Sastri, the oldest of the trinity, was taught Telugu and Sanskrit by his father, who was the pujari (Hindu priest) at the Meenakshi temple in Madurai. Syama Sastri's texts were largely composed in Telugu, widening their popular appeal. Some of his most famous compositions include the nine krithis, Navaratnamaalikā, in praise of the goddess Meenakshi at Madurai, and his eighteen krithi in praise of Kamakshi. As well as composing krithi, he is credited with turning the svarajati, originally used for dance, into a purely musical form.|$|E
25|$|As Joey {{tentatively}} {{enters the}} stage space, he is {{met with a}} spontaneous ovation sparked by <b>the</b> <b>immediacy</b> <b>of</b> the live moment, in turn aided {{by the fact that}} Kohler and Jones never stray from the game that dictates they treat him as a live horse. This playful notion helps Joey’s creators invite the audience to believe in his aliveness, and the audience succumbs, not only for his lifelike movement, but also for the way he is activated by those around him. As both creators and performers, Jones and Kohler soothe Joey’s “nervousness,” and a planned moment when Joey “notices” the audience elicits a generous laugh. Joey shies, nervously clops his hooves, and nickers gently to demonstrate alarm. He sniffs Kohler’s jacket pocket, as he “knows” there is a snack in there. Later, when Jones crosses the stage to demonstrate a feature, he is careful not to walk behind Joey, lest he is kicked. The audience must believe he will not be kicked – only a spiteful puppeteer could activate such a trick – but Jones’s conviction that he should respect the animal’s space foregrounds the moment’s liveness and heightens the audience’s engagement. Finally, a jockey is introduced, and Joey patiently holds still while he is mounted. Joey accepts the rider’s weight without complaint, comfortably parades around the stage, and swiftly exits before the effect is mundane. For the entire time that Joey inhabits the stage, the audience is noticeably spellbound.|$|E

25|$|All that exists, {{throughout}} all time and beyond, is one infinite divine Consciousness, free and blissful, which projects {{within the field}} of its awareness a vast multiplicity of apparently differentiated subjects and objects: each object an actualization of a timeless potentiality inherent in the Light of Consciousness, and each subject the same plus a contracted locus of self-awareness. This creation, a divine play, {{is the result of the}} natural impulse within Consciousness to express the totality of its self-knowledge in action, an impulse arising from love. The unbounded Light of Consciousness contracts into finite embodied loci of awareness out of its own free will. When those finite subjects then identify with the limited and circumscribed cognitions and circumstances that make up this phase of their existence, instead of identifying with the transindividual overarching pulsation of pure Awareness that is their true nature, they experience what they call “suffering.” To rectify this, some feel an inner urge to take up the path of spiritual gnosis and yogic practice, the purpose of which is to undermine their misidentification and directly reveal within <b>the</b> <b>immediacy</b> <b>of</b> awareness the fact that the divine powers of Consciousness, Bliss, Willing, Knowing, and Acting comprise the totality of individual experience as well—thereby triggering a recognition that one’s real identity is that of the highest Divinity, the Whole in every part. This experiential gnosis is repeated and reinforced through various means until it becomes the nonconceptual ground of every moment of experience, and one’s contracted sense of self and separation from the Whole is finally annihilated in the incandescent radiance of the complete expansion into perfect wholeness. Then one’s perception fully encompasses the reality of a universe dancing ecstatically in the animation of its completely perfect divinity.|$|E

He argues that the book's hallmarks are its restraint, brevity and readability, which downplays the extravagant and mythical aspects of the disaster and instead puts in the foreground the stories of the people on the ship. The narrative builds suspense, making the reader care about the characters and revisit the disaster from their perspective.

This 'graphic' kind of clarity can be most sharp when it is most jagged." [...] <b>The</b> <b>immediacy</b> <b>of</b> the approach suited his desire to convey the primitive side of man's nature.
