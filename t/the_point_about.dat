25|$|The {{center of}} mass plays an {{important}} role in astronomy and astrophysics, where it is commonly referred to as the barycenter. The barycenter is the point between two objects where they balance each other; it is the {{center of mass}} where two or more celestial bodies orbit each other. When a moon orbits a planet, or a planet orbits a star, both bodies are actually orbiting around a point that lies away from the center of the primary (larger) body. For example, the Moon does not orbit the exact center of the Earth, but a point on a line between the center of the Earth and the Moon, approximately 1,710km (1,062miles) below the surface of the Earth, where their respective masses balance. This is <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>about</b> which the Earth and Moon orbit as they travel around the Sun. If the masses are more similar, e.g., Pluto and Charon, the barycenter will fall outside both bodies.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>about</b> {{remoteness}} of damages under s 2(1) {{was treated}} in the controversial case of Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson. Here Mr Rogerson bought a car on hire purchase, from a Honda dealer, financed by Royscot Trust Ltd. When Mr Rogerson fell behind in his repayments and sold away the car, Royscot Trust Ltd sued the Honda dealer, because they found it had misrepresented {{the proportion of the}} deposit Mr Rogerson had put down for the car. On this basis they argued that Honda was liable for them not being able to recover the cost of the loan (Mr Rogerson had no money). Royscot Ltd argued that the loss was too remote, or that Mr Rogerson's wrongful sale was a break in the causal chain. But the Court of Appeal held that in any event the test under s 2(1) was the same as in the tort of deceit, that one should be liable for all consequences. Balcombe LJ said this followed from the clear wording of the Act.|$|E

Like [...] "The Tale of the Three Little Pigs", the story uses repetitive formulas to engage the child's attention and to reinforce <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>about</b> safety and shelter. Tatar {{points out that the}} tale is typically framed today as a discovery of what is [...] "just right", but for earlier generations, it was a tale about an intruder who could not control herself when encountering the possessions of others.|$|E

Okereke has described him as a [...] "cousin" [...] due to their Nigerian mothers' close friendship. The track castigates right-wing newspapers for perpetuating a hysterical fear of black youths in hoodies, an action which often leads to opportunities being denied to the Black British community at large. Populist media is also the target of [...] "Hunting for Witches" [...] (with the right-wing tabloid Daily Mail being singled out for criticism), whose subject matter is terrorism, namely the 7 July 2005 London bombings.

500|$|The Tagora´s {{handling}} {{was deemed}} [...] "on the good side", wrote Autocar, and performance {{was described as}} [...] "good but not outstanding". As such the car lay [...] "uneasily close to being listed as under-engined" [...] though the authors conceded that generally the Tagora did not feel under-engined when in use. LJK Setright dissented saying the Tagora was as [...] "refined in its ride as should be expected of it" [...] and that [...] "the car also has {{a good deal more}} road-holding and cornering than might be expected". However, in December 1981 Car magazine judged the car (2.2 GLS model) to be prone to [...] "untidy" [...] handling, tending to under-steer first followed by excessive over-steer. The magazine made a particular note of the advantage in handling and grip enjoyed by the older live-axled Volvo 244, underlining <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>about</b> the Tagora's lack of advantage in terms of road manners.|$|E
500|$|Douglas Murray of The Daily Telegraph {{said of the}} episode, [...] "I can't {{recommend}} it enough", and particularly complimented the episode scenes with Buddha snorting cocaine and the South Park townspeople hiding Muhammad. Murray said, [...] "They make <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>about</b> the absurd self-censorship and thuggish intimidation surrounding the Islamic faith better than anything else I've seen." [...] Amy Duncan of Metro said it [...] "certainly was an episode to remember". Duncan praised the story, which she said [...] "develops with [...] usual rude inferences and below-the-belt remarks". Ryan Broderick of The Hofstra Chronicle said the episode [...] "came together so simply, so smoothly, and so hilariously that it forgives the last couple lame duck episodes of the season". Broderick said it avoided the pitfalls of most landmark episodes by providing an original story {{in addition to the}} throwback references. Nick Zaino of TV Squad said the episode did not offer much new, but also offer good throwbacks and celebrity spoofs, and didn't [...] "pull any punches". Zaino said the episode has [...] "a wonderful sense of the absurd", particularly through the use of Mecha-Streisand and Cartman's hand-puppet.|$|E

2500|$|The Codex Alimentarius Code of Hygienic Practice for Milk {{notes that}} milk {{pasteurization}} {{is designed to}} achieve at least a 5 log10 reduction of Coxiella burnetii. [...] The Code also notes that: “The minimum pasteurization conditions are those having bactericidal effects equivalent to heating every particle of the milk to 72°C for 15 seconds (continuous flow pasteurization) or 63°C for 30 minutes (batch pasteurization)” and that “To ensure that each particle is sufficiently heated, the milk flow in heat exchangers should be turbulent, i.e. the Reynolds number should be sufficiently high.” [...] <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>about</b> turbulent flow is important because simplistic laboratory studies of heat inactivation that use test tubes, without flow, will have less bacterial inactivation than larger scale experiments that seek to replicate conditions of commercial pasteurization.|$|E

2500|$|The plot of Mass Effect: Andromeda was {{met with}} a mixed reception. Destructoid {{described}} it as [...] "dull" [...] and observed that it [...] "struggles to find a foothold because it spends far too long without an easily-identifiable conflict." [...] Andy Hartup of GamesRadar felt that the game lacked the nuance of previous installments, writing, [...] "There’s {{a general lack of}} subtlety and finesse to this game’s storytelling, and much of it feels like it missed <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>about</b> what made the original trilogy such a success." [...] IGN remarked that the plot was sometimes derivative of prior games in the series, using the Remnant as an example, which they felt was simply another [...] "long-dead civilization that’s left advanced technology lying around". By contrast, VideoGamer.com listed the game's plot as a positive, likening it to a Hollywood hero story. Reflecting on his experience with the game, Polygons Arthur Gies wrote, [...] "The story in Andromeda is pretty good, with a number of mysteries on the critical path and some really interesting optional content." ...|$|E
