5|$|In February 1907, {{with nearly}} 300 new stockholders, Harvey began {{construction}} {{on his next}} hotel, Oklahoma Row, also designed by A. O. Clarke. It was built {{to the west of}} Missouri Row with a wide lawn. It had a similar log, concrete stone, and tile construction. The dining room was on the north end. Each of the 40 rooms had fireplaces, as did the dining room and center hall. Every room featured electric lights, sewerage, and running spring water. The hotel also boasted a three-story concrete tower, one of the earliest multistory concrete constructions in the country. Oklahoma Row and other construction projects drained Harvey's funds. Harvey managed to raise enough money to finish Oklahoma Row, but due to his lack of funds, when <b>that</b> <b>hotel</b> finally opened there was no gala event, as there had been when Missouri Row was finished.|$|E

25|$|On 3 April 1987, the City of Beverly Hills, California, {{initiated}} {{an ordinance}} to restrict smoking in most restaurants, in retail stores and at public meetings.

25|$|It {{was located}} {{at the corner of}} Balderas and Avenida Juárez in the {{historic}} center and completely collapsed within moments of the quake. Shortly after its collapse, it began to burn due to a gas leak, which made it extremely difficult to rescue survivors. Nothing survived of the hotel. The space is now the Plaza de la Solidaridad park.

Other restaurants located in <b>that</b> <b>hotel,</b> as well as a DSW store and a New York Sports Club branch, were closed in 2009 after the takeover of the property by Goldman Sachs. Former undeveloped lots in the area have been developed into high-rise buildings; for example, Goldman Sachs built a new headquarters at 200 West Street.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This study {{provides}} {{insights into the}} relationship between data mining activities and the customization of the packages offered to tourists by hotels. Data mining provides a method of understanding the needs and habits of the tourists so <b>that</b> <b>hotels</b> can provide targeted value propositions to tourists from different geographies. For the study, ten prominent hotels around the country were selected and three employees from each hotel with information were interviewed to collect information about the data mining activities they perform. The study identifies <b>that</b> <b>hotels</b> give {{a high level of}} attention to data mining. Many of the hotels have suitable systems to capture the data of the guests, and have suitable staff to operate them. This indicates that data mining capabilities are either being built or are already in place in many of the hotels. It is also seen <b>that</b> <b>hotels</b> actively seek to customize the packages they offer to customers. All these eventually result in increased levels of long term customer loyalty. The regression analysis indicated a very strong relationship between data mining and the customization of service packages. The also study indicates that there is a significant correlation between the data mining activities of the hotels and the customized value and service offerings. This indicates <b>that</b> the <b>hotels</b> of the country are using data mining to develop customized service offerings. This is likely to benefit the hotels as well as Sri Lanka as a whole due to increased repeat visits by the tourists...|$|R

25|$|The ongoing protests were {{estimated}} to cost the Lebanese economy approximately $70 million a day, or $560 million thus far, according to Lebanon's Economy Minister, Jihad Azour. Stores and restaurants in Beirut were forced to keep their doors closed, and the pedestrian streets were deserted. With the holiday season coming up, including Christmas for the large Christian community, and Eid ul-Adha on December 27 for the Muslim community, businesses fear losing even more income due to the political crisis. Tourism, {{one of the largest}} sectors of the economy, which had still not fully recovered from the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah conflict, was also adversely impacted from the mounting tensions after the November 21, 2006 assassination of Cabinet Minister Pierre Gemayel. With Lebanon being a popular holiday destination, businesses also fear that the drop in tourism will further impact their business, with Paul Achkar, head of the Lebanese hotel association, stating <b>that</b> <b>hotel</b> occupancy is currently 25% of normal.|$|E
25|$|During {{his stay}} in Britain, the Sunday Times {{initially}} put Vanunu up {{in a hotel}} in London close to the newspaper's premises, but shortly afterward, he was moved to what was considered a safer location: a lodge near Welwyn, in rural Hertfordshire, which was in an obscure location and accessed by a narrow road. Hounam considered it an excellent hiding place. During one foray into London together with a Sunday Times journalist, Vanunu encountered an Israeli friend, Yoram Bazak, and his girlfriend Dorit on Regent Street. They agreed to meet later. When they met, Bazak intensely questioned Vanunu on his views towards Israel's defense policy, and during the conversation, Vanunu told Bazak {{about the possibility of}} him publicly revealing secrets from Dimona to the British press, Bazak responded with a menacing threat. Hounam speculated that Vanunu's meeting with Bazak was no mere coincidence, and that Bazak had been recruited by Mossad in an attempt to discover Vanunu's motives and try to dissaude him. Vanunu later grew bored of rural Hertfordshire and asked for a new location in London, and he was booked in the first hotel he had stayed in under a false name. Hounam speculated that as Oscar Guerrero, who had followed him and Vanunu to London, had already stayed there, Mossad likely had <b>that</b> <b>hotel</b> under surveillance.|$|E

2500|$|The {{business}} climate for the Marriott Marquis Washington, DC improved dramatically after ground was broken. On May 3, 2011, the hotel received its first convention-related business when the Association of the United States Army {{agreed to take}} space in the hotel for 2014, 2015, and 2016. By August 2012, the hotel secured 15 contracts for about 210,000 room nights through 2021. In September 2011, Marriott announced it and Capstone Development would build a Courtyard by Marriott and a Residence Inn by Marriott on Marriott-owned land north of the Marriott Marquis. Together, the hotels would provide 500 rooms. Marriott asked for $35 million in TIF funds from {{the city for the}} $172 million project, but the city (which was near its borrowing cap) said it was [...] "not entertaining new TIF applications right now." [...] In June 2012, Marriott signed a $210 million contract to operate four hotels owned by Gaylord Entertainment.

2500|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{viability}} of the convention center headquarters hotel occurred again in 2007. Convention hotel room bookings in Washington, D.C., fell 13 percent in 2006 and were estimated to fall another 24 percent in 2007 and 29 percent in 2008, bringing into question the need for a headquarters hotel. In Baltimore, Maryland, a convention center headquarters hotel approved in 2006 failed to boost convention bookings. Furthermore, Gaylord Entertainment Company was constructing a 2,000-room hotel and meeting complex at its Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in Prince George's County, Maryland, just across the city line. The Gaylord complex, the Washington Post said, was likely to draw business away from the proposed D.C. convention headquarters hotel. Reviewing these developments, Heywood Sanders, a professor of public administration at the University of Texas at San Antonio concluded that [...] "Putting in a hotel is no guarantee that it will improve the [...] performance." [...] But others defended the need for a convention headquarters hotel. Convention center officials and William Hanbury, {{president and chief executive officer}} of Washington Convention & Tourism Corp. (a nonprofit group promoting conventions and tourism in the city), blamed the bookings drop on the lack of a headquarters hotel. Hanbury estimated the loss of convention business at $200 million. Additionally, the Washington Post reported <b>that</b> <b>hotel</b> occupancy in the city was still so high that few hotels were willing to give conventions the significant rate discounts they usually received. This, too, was hurting convention center bookings.|$|E

O, yes, he replied, I could eat more, but I thought the twenty-five cents you paid for my dinner was for just what was placed before me. No, I said, the twenty-five cents pays for all you can eat. Hereafter, if one plate is not enough, ask for more, and drink all the coffee you want. All right, he replied, I will. And he did. I also told him to tell his friends this, and suggested that if any white men sitting at his table left anything to eat on their plates before them, {{that it would be}} all right for him to gather it up and take it home for his wife and children.
