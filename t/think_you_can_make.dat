It doesn't take a great {{stretch of the imagination}} that some Falun Gong [...] are going to be among those {{who are going to be}} killed for parts. It just follows, because remember you can't take very old people as sources of organs and you can't take people who are very sick. They, Falun Gong, are in part younger, and by lifestyle, healthier. I would be astounded if they weren't using some of those prisoners as sources of organs." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Parliament, {{he became}} {{associated}} with a faction of the Conservative Party led by Lord Hugh Cecil; the Hughligans. During his first parliamentary session, he opposed the government's military expenditure and Joseph Chamberlain's proposal of extensive tariffs, which were intended to protect Britain's economic dominance. His own constituency effectively deselected him, although he continued to sit for Oldham until the next general election. In {{the months leading up}} to his ultimate change of party from the Conservatives to the Liberals, Churchill made a number of evocative speeches against the principles of Protectionism; 'to <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> a man richer by putting on a tax is like a man thinking that he can stand in a bucket and lift himself up by the handle.' [...] As a result of his disagreement with leading members of the Conservative Party over tariff reform, he made the decision to cross the floor. After the Whitsun recess in 1904, he crossed the floor to sit as a member of the Liberal Party.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Candyman" [...] was filmed on January 28, 2007, {{in an airport}} hangar in Southern California. It was {{directed}} by Matthew Rolston and co-directed by Aguilera. The video {{is based on the}} 1940s World War II theme. In most of the music video, she dances and sings in three different hair colors: red, blonde and brown, as if she were in a singing trio, a tribute to The Andrews Sisters. In other shots she appears as the famous biceps-flexing factory worker from Westinghouse's [...] "We Can Do It!" [...] poster and as pin-up girls Judy Garland, Betty Grable and Rita Hayworth. The video also features product placement for Campari. Benji Schwimmer, 2006 winner of the American dancing competition So <b>You</b> <b>Think</b> <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> Dance, <b>makes</b> a cameo appearance as Aguilera's GI dance partner. Benji's sister Lacey Schwimmer also appears in the video as a jitterbugger. Aguilera asked Rolston to co-direct the video with her after he worked with her for a photo shoot for the cover of Rolling Stone. Shooting the sequences of Aguilera as a singing trio took the longest since they had to be shot for each hair color and camera angle, which was computer-controlled for precision. Choreography was carefully arranged so that none of the versions overlapped and the takes could be spliced together. The clip's color scheme is based on Technicolor films, focusing on primary colors and bright secondary colors.|$|R
