40|$|Many {{harvested}} timber {{species of}} tropical forests {{have not been}} regenerating sufficiently for future cutting cycles, which can demand the application of post-harvesting silvicultural treatments. This study analyzed the profitability of sawnwood produced through four treatments applied on seedlings and saplings naturally present or planted in logging gaps as follows: (1) the standard procedures of reduced-impact logging or control; (2) the tending of the naturally established regeneration; (3) enrichment planting 1 (EP- 1); and (4) enrichment planting 2 (EP- 2). In EP- 1 commercial species were planted in 2 -year-old gaps with no logging residuals removal from the gap while in EP- 2 seedlings were planted in 1 -year-old gaps with logging residuals removal from the gap. The planted timber species in EP- 2 had higher financial value and higher growth rates than the timber species planted in EP- 1. The experiment {{was carried out in}} a certified managed forest in the Eastern Amazon, Brazil. The growth rates of the treated seedlings and saplings were projected in 30 and 60 years from the <b>treatment</b> <b>establishment</b> to simulate sawnwood production. The simulations indicated that, increases of 25 and 50 % in growth rates and increases up to 500 % in timber prices under annual interest rates of 4 and 6 %, the treatments of tending and enrichment planting can be profitable at year 60.

For the first time, {{the laws of}} {{variations}} of the phenotypic structure of the pathogenes populations of mixed infections, conditioned by the mutual influence of the associants {{and the state of}} the organism immune protection, have been established. The most important (in theoretical aspect) are the data about the increase of appearance of the factors of virulence and antibioticoresistance under the conditions of the immune deficiency, which can facilitate the heaviness of the disease and the formation of the "hospital" variants of the pathogenes. The possibility of reducing the heaviness of the disease course and lethality of the burn infection has been justified by applying the immunomodulators, which ensures the elimination of pathogenes of the virulent and antibioticoresistant individuals from the population.

The greatest sediment load was observed in 2008 due to the initial soil disturbance and gradually decreased thereafter. The mean annual sediment yield through 2010 was 0. 36 and 8. 30 Mg ha for the watersheds with and without PFS, respectively, a 96 % sediment trapping efficiency for the 4 -yr study period. The amount and distribution of PFS had no significant impact on runoff and sediment yield, probably due to the relatively large width (37 - 78 m) of footslope PFS. The findings suggest that incorporation of PFS at the footslope position of annual rowcrop systems provides an effective approach to reducing sediment loss in runoff from agricultural watersheds under a no-till system...|$|E

Ninety, twin bearing Romney ewes were treated before lambing with a long-acting injectable formulation of moxidectin, a 100 -day controlled release capsule (CRC) containing abamectin and albendazole, or remained untreated. After lambing, seven ewes from each treatment group were selected for uniformity of lambing date and, along with their twin lambs, relocated indoors.

This study tested the effectiveness of three habitat treatments in increasing invertebrates and seeds in London parks, and their usage by house sparrows. Treatments were: annually sown ‘wildlife seed’ plots; sown perennial wildflower meadows; and existing grass grown taller. <b>Treatment</b> <b>establishment</b> and seed abundance were assessed by vegetation measurements, and practicality qualitatively assessed through questionnaires. Invertebrate abundance and variety were measured using sweep netting and vacuum sampling, and relationships tested with treatment type and modelled air pollution levels. Bird usage, and local house sparrow populations and productivity, were monitored over three years and relationships tested with treatments and air pollution. All treatments provided more invertebrates and seed than short grass. Wildlife seed plots contained the most seed during both autumn and winter. Wildflower meadows supported the most invertebrates, while each treatment benefited particular groups. Invertebrate variety at family level was highest in wildflower meadows and wildlife seed plots, probably through increased plant diversity. Abundance for numerous groups related positively to sward height. Varied vegetation structure should benefit the most invertebrate groups. Wildlife seed plots were most used by house sparrows, largely in the breeding season for invertebrates, while wildflower meadows were not used. Open vegetation structure probably permitted birds access. Wildlife seed plots may have buffered colonies against breeding season food shortages in one year. No strong relationships were found between invertebrate abundance and air pollution. Relationships between house sparrow population parameters and air pollution were mixed. Heterogeneous vegetation structure is important for invertebrates, and for bird access to food. Habitat homogenisation at various scales, combined with other pressures, may contribute to limiting urban house sparrow populations. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|Cryopreservation {{of ovarian}} tissue is a {{promising}} technique to rescue animal species and breeds from extinction and to restore fertility of women after cancer <b>treatment.</b> <b>Establishment</b> of cryopreservation protocols starts by choosing {{the most efficient}} cryoprotective agents, the dimension of ovarian fragments, {{the volume of the}} cryoprotectant solution, the addition of extra-cellular cryoprotectant, and efficient methods to evaluate follicular quality. Based on these parameters, caprine ovarian tissue was successfully cryopreserved when cortical fragmented in pieces (~ 1 mm 3) exposed to a low volume (frozen in 1 ml or vitrified in 0. 5 ml) of a combination of ethylene glycol and sucrose, according to analysis based on viability markers to assure follicular viability. However, cellular viability after cryopreservation does not guarantee follicular development. It was observed that cryopreserved early-staged follicles show a significant decline in quality after having them in vitro cultured for 24 h. One of the damage effects caused by cryoprotectants is called osmotic stress, because of the high osmolality of the cryoprotective agents. It has been demonstrated that high concentrations of cryoprotectants, e. g. 4. 0 M EG (5242 mOsm), are not responsible for osmotic damage. On the other hand, when early-staged follicles were exposed to an ionic solution of 9 % NaCl (2800 mOsm), most of the cells (92 %) had lost their viability, showing that ions are the cause the cellular damage and not the cryoprotectants (non-ionic solutes). The aim of cryopreservation of early-staged follicles is storage for an undetermined time without viability impairment, followed by further complete development after thawing/warming. Despite the success obtained with the complete in vitro development of cryopreserved early-staged murine follicles, including development of frozen-thawed follicles followed by successful fertilization, embryo development and healthy offspring, similar success is difficult to achieve with large mammals in vitro. There is no protocol for complete in vitro development of early-staged follicles from large mammals. Thus, the importance of transplantation to obtain complete follicular development after cryopreservation. Success of the cryopresevation procedure was demonstrated by the complete follicular development (from primordial to pre-ovulatory stages) after freezing-thawing of ovarian tissue fragments and their re-implantation in ovariectomised donor goats. Thereby, ovarian cortical fragments re-modulated into a new ovarian-like organ, from which blood supply and endocrine function (oestradiol and progesterone production) were restored. The next step before clinical application, consist in evaluate some remaining points related to cryopreservation and transplantation. For example, absence of DNA damage and high survival rate of early-staged follicles after cryopreservation, does not mean that cooling cannot affect DNA by activating genes related to diseases and malformations. Thus, more experiments should be performed in adequate animal models, such as the goat, until data can be satisfactorily repeated and normal offspring can be guaranteed. Finally, although cryopreservation of ovarian tissue should not be promoted to postpone childbearing in healthy women, such a technique may be used in the future for safeguarding maternity for women requiring chemo- or radiotherapy. In addition, it may in the near future be an important technique for the preservation of endangered breeds and species...|$|E

40|$|Proliferation of weed {{seeds and}} {{pathogenic}} organisms {{in the soil}} can cause a decline of yield of strawberry grown continuously on the same site. Rotations with cover crops or tillage {{have been found to}} mitigate this problem, but data are needed on the relative effectiveness of various potential rotations. Conventional management of weeds and soil pathogens in strawberry can cause detrimental effects to the chemical, physical, and biological components of the soil and subsequently reduces plant vigor. Previous research suggests that rotating cover crops with strawberry reduces weeds and soil pathogens and maintains the chemical, physical and biological components of the soil. We evaluated soil characteristics of seven monoculture cover crops (Panicum virgatum L., Andropogon gerardii Vitman, Lolium perenne L., Sorghastrum nutans (L.) Nash, Rudbeckia hirta L., Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, and Tagetes erecta L.), continuous tillage, and continuous `Honeoye 2 ̆ 7 strawberry during <b>treatment</b> <b>establishment</b> and after the rotation of the treatments with strawberry by the chemical, physical, and biological components of the soil. A second objective was to evaluate type and biomass of weeds, density of lesion nematodes, and plant density and yield of strawberry among the rotation of those seven monoculture cover crops, continuous tillage, and continuous `Honeoye 2 ̆ 7 strawberry plots. Plots were established in 1996 and maintained through 2005. In 2005, treatments were tilled and `Honeoye 2 ̆ 7 strawberry plants were planted into the plots and were maintained until 2008. Chemical analyses of the soil showed minimum effects by treatments. During treatment (1996 - 2005), plots of continuous tillage decreased water infiltration time and bulk density; however soil macro aggregate mass was lowest in plots of continuous tillage. Physical components of the soil were further reduced in the continuous tillage plots during strawberry production (2005 - 2007). Plots rotated with L. perenne showed high carbon utilization and mineralized nitrogen. Plots rotated with T. erecta reduced overall biological activity in the first year after treatment, but effects were less after the second year of strawberry growth. Plots of continuous tillage showed high microbial richness in the second year of strawberry production; however effects were not different after the third year of production. Monocot weed biomass was lowest in plots of continuous tillage or rotated with A. gerardii, P. virgatum, S. bicolor, and S. nutans. Dicot weed biomass was lowest in plots of continuous tillage or rotated with S. bicolor. Dicot weed biomass was greatest in plots of continuous strawberry and plots rotated with L. perenne. Lesion nematode counts were below the threshold level for all treatments. Strawberry plant density and yield of strawberry were greatest in plots tilled or rotated with A. gerardii, P. virgatum, S. bicolor, S. nutans, or T. erecta. Continuous tillage reduced organic carbon and nitrogen in the soil, broke down soil aggregate particles and reduced water infiltration, and showed biological variability in the soil. Plots rotated with A. gerardii, L. perenne, P. virgatum, R. hirta, and S. nutans increased organic carbon and nitrogen, increased macro aggregate mass and water infiltration, and showed maintainable biological activity during strawberry production. In addition, strawberry production areas tilled or rotated with A. gerardii, P. virgatum, S. bicolor, S. nutans, or T. erecta had lower weed biomass and greater plant establishment and yield of strawberry...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} of the dermatoglyphics of hands of 3759 men (987 men, 2773 women) - {{the representatives of the}} different national, regional, professional, social and nosological groups has been performed. The work is aimed at studying the intra- and integroup variation of the dermatoglyphic signs on the territory of the Tyumen region, at the analysis of the degree of influence of the different factors on the variation of these signs. The obtained information about the laws of distribution of the dermatoglyphic signs of the native and coming population of the Tyumen region, depending on the climatic characteristics of the region and the terms of living are the theoretical base for the developement of the prophylactic medicine of the North and organization of the professional selection for the work in these regions. The information about the presence of the selective accumulation in the North regions and in the professional groups of persons with the resistance to the most spread diseases in them can serve as the theoretical and practical premises for the performance of the identical prophylactic measures, facilitating the increase of the population health level.
