5|$|At first Catherine {{kept the}} nine-year-old king, who cried at his coronation, close <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> slept in his chamber.

In many parts of France the rule of nobles held sway rather than that of the crown. The challenges Catherine faced were complex and in some ways difficult for her to comprehend as a foreigner.|$|E
