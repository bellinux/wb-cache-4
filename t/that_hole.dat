But {{toward the end of}} the 1980s, a combination of exploration successes and innovative thinking led to development of a field which most of the industry had seen as uneconomic. In December 1985, Petro-Canada spudded the Cohasset A-52 step-out well to explore the Cohasset structure southwest of Mobil's 1973 discovery well.

Green then participated during the battles of the 1864 Red River Campaign in the Trans-Mississippi Theater. He fought in the Camden Expedition and the Battle of Poison Spring around Lee Plantation, about 10 miles from Camden, Arkansas, on April 18, 1864. His command was in reserve in the action and entered {{a hole in the}} Confederate line that was caused by Union {{artillery}} fire. Greene plugged <b>that</b> <b>hole</b> and sealed the victory, routing the remaining Union defensive line. This fight is noted for accusations of the murdering of wounded Federal United States Colored Troops as they surrendered, left behind when the Union forces retreated.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} points awarded on each hole is {{determined}} based on comparison {{of the number of}} strokes taken to a fixed score, usually par. This fixed score is then adjusted in relation to the player's handicap. Once players have taken two strokes more than the adjusted fixed score, they may abandon the hole and move on to the next, as it is then not possible to score any points on <b>that</b> <b>hole.</b> Because of this, it is still possible to be competitive even allowing for a few bad holes. At the end of the round, the {{number of points}} scored on each hole is totaled to give a final score. The winner of a Stableford competition is the player with the highest point total. Final scores may be modified for all players using the Competition Stableford Adjustment system.|$|E

It resembled a system of hollow concentric wheels, filled with fire, with the rims pierced by holes like those of a flute. Consequently, the Sun was the fire that one could see through a hole {{the same size as the}} Earth on the farthest wheel, and an eclipse corresponded with the occlusion of <b>that</b> <b>hole.</b> The diameter of the solar wheel was twenty-seven times that of the Earth (or twenty-eight, depending on the sources) and the lunar wheel, whose fire was less intense, eighteen (or nineteen) times. Its hole could change shape, thus explaining lunar phases. The stars and the planets, located closer, followed the same model.|$|E

500|$|Musically, Love's {{work with}} Hole and her solo {{efforts have been}} {{characterized}} as alternative rock; Hole's early material, however, was described by critics as being stylistically closer to grindcore and aggressive punk rock. Spins October 1991 review of Hole's first album noted Love's layering of harsh and abrasive riffs buried more sophisticated musical arrangements. In 1998, Love stated <b>that</b> <b>Hole</b> had [...] "always been a pop band. We always had a subtext of pop.

500|$|Otosclerosis is a {{congenital}} or spontaneous-onset disease {{characterized by}} abnormal bone remodeling {{in the inner}} ear. Often this causes the stapes {{to adhere to the}} oval window, which impedes its ability to conduct sound, and is a cause of conductive hearing loss. Clinical otosclerosis is found in about 1% of people, although it is more common in forms that do not cause noticeable hearing loss. Otosclerosis is more likely in young age groups, and females. Two common treatments are stapedectomy, the surgical removal of the stapes and replacement with an artificial prosthesis, and stapedotomy, the creation of a small hole in the base of the stapes followed by the insertion of an artificial prosthesis into <b>that</b> <b>hole.</b> [...] Surgery may be complicated by a persistent stapedial artery, fibrosis-related damage {{to the base of the}} bone, or obliterative otosclerosis, resulting in obliteration of the base.|$|E

Oh Land herself stated that the song is about [...] "always going for the win, always focusing on the result and sometimes missing the process because you're such a perfectionist". According to Paul MacInnes from The Guardian, the lyrics serve as a [...] "plea to a lover about the pitfalls of excess"; the song opens with Oh Land singing, [...] "Small boy, big dreams / Going in for a bite", which is [...] "sublimely literal".

Hole resumed touring with Imperial Teen. Love would later make claims that an additional reason the band left the tour was due to Manson and Korn's (whom they also toured with in Australia) sexualized treatment of teenage female audience members. Love told interviewers at 99X.FM in Atlanta: [...] "What I really don't like—there are certain girls that like us, or like me, who are really messed up... and they {{do not need to be}}—they're very young—and they do not need to be taken and raped, or filmed having enema contests... going out into the audience and picking up fourteen and fifteen-year-old girls who obviously cut themselves, and then having to see them in the morning... it's just uncool." ...|$|E

Despite this, she considers Elastica, along with the Sex Pistols and the Buzzcocks, as the only UK bands among her favorites. The band cited the Sex Pistols, the New York Dolls, and The Stooges as their musical influences. They also preferred the Sex Pistols over the Clash.

500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{widespread}} rejection of his Gogmagog claims, Lethbridge became increasingly critical of the academic and professional archaeological community, believing that an attitude of what he called [...] "trade unionism" [...] had caused most archaeologists to reject independent thought. As a result, he decided to resign and move away from Cambridge in late 1957. Relocating to Branscombe in southern Devon, he and Mina set up home in Hole House, a fortified building that dated to the Early Modern period, and angered some of the locals by banning fox hunters from crossing his land. Lethbridge came to believe <b>that</b> <b>Hole</b> House was haunted, describing unexplained noises and smells there; this increased his interest in the paranormal, and he decided to devote much of his time to investigating such phenomena in what he deemed to be a scientific manner. Lethbridge believed that ghosts were projections stored in rock and other material substances and which echoed particularly emotional or traumatic events that either happened in the past or will happen in the future. He focused many of his experiments on dowsing using a pendulum, coming to believe that the length of string used and the number of oscillations could be used to determine the type of object being detected.|$|E

500|$|After various failed relationships, Lex finally {{believes}} he has what he wants when he begins a romantic relationship with Lana Lang. In [...] "Hypnotic", {{in an effort to}} stop hurting Lana emotionally, Clark told her that he no longer loved her. This drives Lana into Lex's arms. Writer Darren Swimmer explains that this was not something that just happened in the series, but something that had been hinted at for many seasons. Rosenbaum admits that Lex had a crush on Lana for many years, but contends that he tried to help Clark win Lana early on—he succeeded. When Clark and Lana's relationship crumbled, because of Clark's deceit, Lex was waiting. Rosenbaum believes that Lana was [...] "tired of the boy and wanted a man around". By contrast, Swimmer believes that Lana started dating Lex as a way of making Clark mad, but the relationship [...] "turned into much more". Kreuk contends that Lana went to Lex because [...] "she knows she will never really love him." [...] Kreuk believes that Lana's relationship with the men in her life was originally motivated by a desire to fill a void in her life that was left after her parents were killed. This need to fill that emptiness was fulfilled in [...] "Void", when Lana took a drug to induce death so that she could see her parents in the afterlife. Upon meeting her parents, Kreuk believes that Lana realized that she no longer needed someone else to fill <b>that</b> <b>hole</b> in her.
