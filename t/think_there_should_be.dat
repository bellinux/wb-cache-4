For example, actor Michael Caine once said: [...] "I don't want to sound like Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells, but I do <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> some sort of national service for young men". People writing them have been claimed by commentators to be readers of the Daily Mail, despite the original letters not originating in that publication.|$|E

She has expressed her opinion of the comparison in the lyrics to [...] "God Given Name": [...] "I'm not her and never will be" [...] – which was purposely set as the album's opening track to show their differences. In his review for the album, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone magazine referred to the lyrics as a declaration of independence. In {{an interview with the}} Daily Mail, Knowles commented: [...] "People <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> this great rivalry between us, but there's never been any competition. There's a big age gap and we are two very different characters." [...] Beyoncé was unwilling to bring her sister into the recording industry, reasoning that it [...] "involves a lot of pressure". Knowles countered by saying, [...] "It's good to have her advice, but we really have different goals".|$|E

However, he said Labour would still campaign in favour of the union in such an event. He later told the BBC that he had simply been arguing that it would be wrong for Westminster to prevent a vote if the Scottish parliament had agreed one. He stressed that he did not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> another referendum, adding that [...] "independence would be catastrophic for many people in Scotland" [...] as it would lead to [...] "turbo-charged austerity".|$|E

[...] Bündchen later posted a statement on her blog saying, [...] "My intention in making a comment about the importance of breastfeeding {{has nothing to do with}} the law. It comes from my passionate beliefs about children. Being a new mom has brought a lot of questions. I feel like I am in a constant search for answers on what might be the best for my child.

The prime minister explained in January 2012 [...] "I always thought the hunting ban was a pretty bizarre piece of legislation ... I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> a free vote in the House of Commons. I think the Commons should make its mind up about this.

[...] However, in December 2012 Owen Paterson, the Environment Secretary, said that there was no immediate likelihood of winning a Commons vote to make hunting legal again and that supporters of hunting would need to do [...] "more work" [...] to win over sceptical MPs.|$|E
2500|$|Todd Akin, {{a long-time}} anti-abortion activist, {{served as a}} Republican member of the House of Representatives for Missouri's 2nd congressional {{district}} from 2001 until 2013. On August 7, 2012, Akin won the Republican primary to become his party's nominee for the U.S. Senate election in Missouri. On August 19, Akin said that victims of what he termed [...] "legitimate rape" [...] rarely become pregnant. He said this during an interview aired on the St. Louis television station KTVI-TV when asked whether women who are raped and become pregnant should {{have the option of}} abortion. He replied:Well you know, people always want to try to make that as one of those things, well how do you, how do you slice this particularly tough sort of ethical question. First of all, from what I understand from doctors, that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. But let's assume that maybe that didn't work or something. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist and not attacking the child.|$|E
2500|$|Westbrook's {{struggle}} with cocaine addiction {{has been widely}} documented in the British press and media. She has confessed that she first tried the drug {{at the age of}} 14, in a nightclub. After winning her role in EastEnders at the age of 16, Westbrook was a regular on the London club scene, and her cocaine usage escalated. She has commented [...] "I was always in clubs and everyone was doing coke and it was glamorous – except obviously, it wasn't at all. I was just very young, very stupid and very easily led...I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> someone at EastEnders to say to young people when they come in, 'Look, your life is about to change, you're going to be invited to things, and you'll be offered drugs.' Someone who can tell them what sort of people are about, and what sort of papers, and how quickly what you've worked for all those years can be gone." [...] It is estimated that she has spent over £250,000 on drugs, used 5g of cocaine every single day throughout her first pregnancy, and has admitted that during her lowest ebb she attempted suicide several times.|$|E

5000|$|He {{believes}} that {{their ability to}} declare what {{the powers of the}} legislature are will lead to extension of legislative power, especially because the Supreme Court can interpret the Constitution according to its [...] "spirit and reason" [...] and will not be bound by its words alone. Like in Britain, this will allow them to [...] "mold the government into almost any shape they please." [...] Also, their ability to deem the validity of state legislation overrides the state judiciaries and will eventually make them so [...] "trifling and unimportant, as not to be worth having.” [...] He also <b>thinks</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> more checks on the branch and judges <b>should</b> not only <b>be</b> removed on the basis of crime.

The remaining species were in a low percentage. He verified in Minas Gerais the relative rarity of Trichophyton violaceum, the culture and pathogenic power of which he studied, showing that, contrary to what has been verified in other countries (12 to 50 %) and even in Brasil (S.

6000|$|... 289. I had intended, in conclusion, gentlemen, {{to incur}} such blame of {{presumption}} {{as might be}} involved in offering some hints for present practical methods in architectural schools, but here again I am checked, as I have been throughout, {{by a sense of}} the uselessness of all minor means, and helps, without the establishment of a true and broad educational system. My wish would be to see the profession of the architect united, not with that of the engineer, but of the sculptor. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> a separate school and university course for engineers, in which the principal branches of study connected with that of practical building should be the physical and exact sciences, and honors should be taken in mathematics; but I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> another school and university course for the sculptor and architect, in which literature and philosophy should be the associated branches of study, and honors should be taken in literis humanioribus; and I think a young architect's examination for his degree (for mere pass), should be much stricter than that of youths intending to enter other professions. The quantity of scholarship necessary for the efficiency of a country clergyman is not great. So that he be modest and kindly, the main truths he has to teach may be learned better in his heart than in books, and taught in very simple English. The best physicians I have known spent very little time in their libraries; and though my lawyer sometimes chats with me over a Greek coin, I think he regards the time so spent in the light rather of concession to my idleness than as helpful to his professional labors.|$|E
