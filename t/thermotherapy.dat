He has also made research contributions in the diagnosis and treatment of other benign and malignant tumors, such as tumors of the ciliary body epithelium, pigment epithelium, and leiomyomas.|$|E
50|$|Laser {{ablation}} {{can be used}} on {{benign and}} malignant lesions in various organs, which is called laser-induced interstitial <b>thermotherapy.</b> The main applications currently involve the reduction of benign thyroid nodules and destruction of primary and secondary malignant liver lesions.|$|E
50|$|Microwave <b>thermotherapy,</b> {{also called}} {{microwave}} therapy, {{is a type}} of treatment in which body tissue is heated by microwave irradiation to damage and kill cancer cells or to make cancer cells more sensitive to the effects of radiation and certain anticancer drugs.|$|E
5000|$|This kind {{of therapy}} is offered as [...] "Fiebertherapie" [...] (fever therapy) or better [...] "Aktive Fiebertherapie" [...] (active fever therapy). This term was {{introduced}} by E.

5000|$|<b>Thermotherapy</b> {{increase}} the extensibility of collagen tissues. Using heat, it can relieve the stiffness in joints in different cases. Shortwave and Microwave heat application may reduce muscle spasms, and selective heating with microwaves can accelerate absorption of hematomas. This will, in turn, allow the stiff muscle to stretch. Ultrasounds are not absorbed significantly in homogenous muscle. Heat therapy using hyperthermia {{has been used}} to treat cancer in combination with ionizing radiation.|$|E
50|$|Heat (<b>thermotherapy)</b> {{is usually}} applied at least 48-72 {{hours after the}} initial injury. It is used to improve blood flow and {{subsequently}} healing, and to increase extensibility of tissues. Improved blood flow can also encourage fluid reabsorption, which reduces swelling, and encourages phagocytic cells to enter {{the site of the}} injury. Liniments are sometimes used to increase heat to an area. Both heat and cold have been shown to decrease muscle spasm and pain.|$|E
5000|$|Kellogg {{described}} the Sanitarium system as [...] "a composite physiologic method comprising hydrotherapy, phototherapy, <b>thermotherapy,</b> electrotherapy, mechanotherapy, dietetics, physical culture, cold-air cure, and health training". To assist with diagnostics {{and evaluation of}} therapeutic efficacy, various measures of physiological integrity were utilised to obtain numerous vital coefficients, [...] "especially {{in relation to the}} integrity and efficiency of the blood, the heart, the lungs, the liver, the kidneys, stomach, intestines, brain, nerves and muscles".|$|E
5000|$|This {{department}} employed both {{solar and}} electric light, {{with the latter}} used chiefly during winter. Phototherapy held a prominent place at Battle Creek, where the first electric light bath was constructed. Regarding the application of electricity, Kellogg noted that [...] "electricity is not capable of accomplishing half the marvels that are claimed for it by many enthusiastic electrotherapists". Nevertheless, he considered it valuable when {{used in conjunction with}} hydrotherapy, <b>thermotherapy,</b> and other methods.|$|E
50|$|RBDV can be {{eradicated}} from infected {{plants by}} {{a procedure that}} first applies <b>thermotherapy</b> then cryotherapy to infected shoots. Applying heat to infected plants causes vacuoles in infected cells to enlarge, with these cells later being killed during cryotherapy. Adding either Fe-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or Fe-ethylenediaminedi(o)hydroxyphenylacetic acid after cryotherapy stimulates regrowth and prevents chlorosis from developing in plant shoots. Using this method, about 80% of shoots survive the initial heat therapy, with 33% surviving the cryotherapy and successfully regrowing.|$|E
50|$|Heat therapy, {{also called}} <b>thermotherapy,</b> {{is the use}} of heat in therapy, such as for pain relief and health. It can {{take the form of a}} hot cloth, hot water bottle, ultrasound, heating pad, hydrocollator packs, {{whirlpool}} baths, cordless FIR heat therapy wraps, and others. It can be beneficial to those with arthritis and stiff muscles and injuries to the deep tissue of the skin. Heat may be an effective self-care treatment for conditions like rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
50|$|Transurethral {{microwave}} <b>thermotherapy</b> (TUMT) {{is one of}} {{a number}} of effective and safe procedures used in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). TUMT provides a one-time efficacious treatment of LUTS due to BPH. It is an alternative treatment to pharmacotherapy such as Alpha blockers, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), transurethral needle ablation of the prostate (TUNA), photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP) and prostatic removal or prostatectomy.|$|E
50|$|A prostatic stent is a stent {{used to keep}} {{open the}} male urethra and allow the passing of urine in cases of prostatic {{obstruction}} and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Prostatic obstruction is a common condition {{with a variety of}} causes. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common cause, but obstruction may also occur acutely after treatment for BPH such as transurethral needle ablation of the prostate (TUNA), transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), transurethral microwave <b>thermotherapy</b> (TUMT), prostate cancer or after radiation therapy.|$|E
50|$|She {{resigned}} from teaching {{to work at}} the Battle Creek Sanitarium in Michigan where she learned about hydrotherapy, phototherapy, <b>thermotherapy,</b> electrotherapy and mechanotherapy—the strategies and health principles advocated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. She attended classes there with the American Medical Missionary College and took classes in Chicago, graduating in 1903. She returned home and became the first African-American woman licensed to practice medicine in Lexington, Kentucky. After about a year, she built an office on North Limestone Street (fronting Rand Avenue) where she practiced for over twenty years.|$|E
