5|$|Modifications to {{the house}} include the {{addition}} of a large pediment-shaped dormer that projects {{from the center of the}} main roof and is lighted by a rectangular double window. Part of <b>the</b> <b>veranda</b> was enclosed and the stairs that lead to a formal garden were removed. Above the center of <b>the</b> <b>veranda</b> is a second-story projection that was described as visually compromising the elegance of the rear facade.|$|E
5|$|Cave 13 on a {{slightly}} higher level than cave 12, is a small dwelling with an open court and from 2 steps lead to a veranda. To {{the right of the}} court is a cistern. <b>The</b> <b>veranda</b> has a bench along its right wall.

5|$|At 16, {{the aging}} Lad befriends Sonya, a seven-year-old girl whose father {{works at the}} Place. Her father forces her to assist him with his work, then brutally mistreats her if she is slow. The Master and the Place's {{superintendent}} try to quell the behavior, with no success. During a walk with the girl, Lad protects her from her father. The next day, while the Master and Mistress are at a show and the other workers are off on holiday, Sonya's father starts to beat her for accidentally dropping a heavy basket. Lad comes to her rescue and they retreat to <b>the</b> <b>veranda</b> where she pets him while he sleeps. When Sonya goes to the barn, her father is waiting for her and closes the door. Somehow she senses Lad beside her, which gives her the courage {{to stand up to}} her father. The man imagines he sees Lad beside her and runs away in fear. Unknown to both, Lad had died in his sleep and the Master and Mistress were crying over his body on <b>the</b> <b>veranda.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cave 1 {{is divided}} into four parts: a veranda, a middle room, a cell, and a half cell. <b>The</b> <b>veranda</b> has a bench along the right wall. Its front {{possibly}} had two quadrangular pillars, traces of one are seen around the ceiling. A rock beam was present over the pillars, above the beam ribs and a rail pattern could have existed. In a recess below <b>the</b> <b>veranda</b> is an earth-filled cistern. A door with a small window to the left leads into the middle room. The middle room has a bench along the right wall. Towards {{the back of the}} middle room, to the left, is the half cell and to the right the cell.

5000|$|The Donoho Hotel is {{a two-story}} {{weatherboard}} frame structure {{resting on a}} brick foundation. The hotel is an elaborate [...] "T" [...] shape, with {{the north and south}} wings hanging from the ends of the T's crossbar, and the rear kitchen wing (added in the 1930s) being <b>the</b> T's base. <b>Verandas</b> span <b>the</b> length of the facade and both sides of both stories. <b>The</b> <b>verandas</b> are supported by four large columns (flanking the hotel's entrance) and twenty-two smaller columns, and contain oak tongue and groove floors. All but one of the hotel's rooms are accessible only from <b>the</b> <b>verandas.</b>|$|R
5|$|Cave 3 has an open veranda and a cell. <b>The</b> <b>veranda</b> has a bench {{along the}} back wall. A door leads to a cell, which has a seat in a left recess. In front of the recess, below the seat, are {{vertical}} bands. Between caves 2 and 3 there is {{a seat in the}} front, in a recess.|$|E

5|$|Cave 9 located to {{the right}} of Cave 8, can be entered via the latter's veranda. Cave 9 has its own veranda and a hall. <b>The</b> <b>veranda</b> has four Satakarni-period, broken pillars. The hall has a larger central door - with windows on either side - and a side door, both having grooves for wooden frames. The purpose of this hall is unknown and speculated to be a school or study.|$|E
50|$|The {{house was}} {{inspired}} by Fowler's book, and {{is a good example}} of his theories put into practice. Features which are directly linked to his ideas, apart from the octagonal plan, are the central spiral staircase, symmetrical arrangement of rooms with interconnecting doors, <b>the</b> <b>verandas</b> running all round the building, and the flat roof surmounted by a cupola. In accordance with Fowler's theories, the detailing is relatively plain for the period. Openings are simply framed by moldings. <b>The</b> covered <b>verandas</b> lack excess detail, having modest turned balustrade spindles and supporting posts. The decorative effect of the house comes from the basic design features: the octagonal shape and <b>the</b> external <b>verandas.</b>|$|R
50|$|As the {{settlers}} during the Ottoman rule were mostly wealthy people, {{many of the}} houses have two storeys, the first {{being used as a}} cattle-shed and the second being inhabited by the owners. Characteristic features of the Bozhentsi architecture are <b>the</b> <b>verandas,</b> <b>the</b> stone-plate roofs, the corner fireplaces and the ceiling woodcarvings. The pavement of the streets in the village is only cobblestone.|$|R
50|$|Changes {{have been}} minor. The most {{noticeable}} exterior {{change has been}} the removal of <b>the</b> timber <b>veranda</b> deck to <b>the</b> Reynolds Street side and the installation of low steps {{to provide access to}} the bar and <b>the</b> side <b>verandas.</b> <b>The</b> timber rail balustrade was replaced on the ground floor by horizontal weatherboards. In appearance the hotel is both typical of its era and an increasing rarity.|$|R
5|$|Cave 10 {{is located}} {{at a higher level}} than cave 9 and is {{difficult}} to reach as its front is broken. An open veranda with a broken ceiling and floor leads to a middle room through a grooved broken door, which has windows on either side. The right wall of the hall has a recess with a seat. A cell {{to the left of the}} room has a seat in a recess. A door from the cell leads to a half-cell which has a recess and seat. Traces of painting are seen on the ceiling. Outside <b>the</b> <b>veranda</b> to the left is a cistern.|$|E
5|$|Cave 12 {{is a small}} {{dwelling}} {{entered by}} a door from <b>the</b> <b>veranda</b> of cave 11. It has its own open veranda, which has a partly broken floor and ceiling and recessed benches {{on the left and}} right of the door to the middle room. The middle room has a small window {{to the left of the}} door and a seat recess in its right wall. In the back wall of the middle room to the left is a half cell - which has a seat recess - and a cell with a grooved door. The floor of the cave has a coating of cement, while the ceiling of the middle room bears painted concentric circles.|$|E
5|$|Cave 2 {{is similar}} to cave 1 in design. <b>The</b> <b>veranda</b> has two pillars and two {{pilaster}}s, a bench between each pillar and pilaster with curtains in the back, which have a rail pattern. Over the pillars rests the rail-patterned rock beam, above which is the ceiling. Parts of the pillars and pilasters are broken. In front over the beam project rock imitations of rafters. A doorway with grooves for a wooden frame, leads into a middle room, with a bench along the left wall. The position of the hall-cell and cell are exchanged with respect to cave 1 design. Each has a bench.|$|E
50|$|Verandas with {{cast iron}} {{railings}} and supports {{run around the}} upper stories. The wide roof eaves, both on the main house and the cupola, have scroll brackets. The ornate ironwork of <b>the</b> <b>verandas</b> contrasts with <b>the</b> simple wooden door and window surrounds.|$|R
50|$|Below are {{drawings}} of the Watertown Octagon House dated March 28, 1935, prepared by the Historic American Buildings Survey.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{the effects of}} the passive solar heating of the individual housing unit located in Nis, which are brought about by use of passive solar system made up of glass veranda and thermo accumulative cross brick wall having thickness of d = 20 cm and d = 45 cm. The object is not heated additionally by means of conventional energy sources. On the thermo accumulative wall there are windows for direct absorption of the sun radiation. This paper also analyzes the inner temperatures in the room and in <b>the</b> glass <b>veranda,</b> in <b>the</b> thermally isolated object with cross thermo accumulative concrete and brick wall having thickness of 20 and 40 cm. There have been given diagrams of the inner temperatures in <b>the</b> glass <b>veranda</b> and <b>the</b> room of the object for its different orientations: ψ = 0 ° (orientation of <b>the</b> glass <b>veranda</b> towards <b>the</b> south, ψ = + 80 ° (orientation of <b>the</b> glass <b>veranda</b> towards <b>the</b> east), ψ = − 80 ° (orientation of <b>the</b> glass <b>veranda</b> towards <b>the</b> west) ...|$|R
5|$|Citrus was {{distributed}} primarily in a regional market {{and was a}} luxury in northern cities; oranges in New York sold for about 50 cents per fruit. The acreage attached to the house Stowe purchased could produce an income of $2,000 a month ($ in 2009). Stowe wrote to author George Eliot to update her {{on the progress of}} improvements to the house in Mandarin, putting up wallpaper, improving plaster, and building a veranda that wrapped around the structure. She took pains not to disturb a giant oak and instead built <b>the</b> <b>veranda</b> around the tree. The house could accommodate as many as 17 family members and friends.|$|E
5|$|Built in 1837, the Acors Barns House is a two-and-one half story Greek Revival {{house with}} a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade {{of the house is}} five bays wide with 6-over-6 sash and the main {{entrance}} has a Greek Revival portico supported by fluted Doric columns from top step. The simple single-panel door is surrounded by sidelights. The corners of the building have simple pilasters and four chimneys rising from the top. The rear of the house has a one-story veranda with a shallow hipped roof that is supported by square columns with a simple balustrade. <b>The</b> <b>veranda</b> has large 6-over-9 sash windows that extend almost a full story. In 1975, the area surrounding the property has undergone significant change, but the house is surrounded by trees and shrubs and a wrought iron fence that helps set it apart from the neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Ellwood's 1898-1899 renovations were superficial, {{especially}} {{when compared to}} the alterations his son made to the original design a decade later. He had the bracketed cornice replaced with a Classical cornice with dentils and a projecting molding. The window lintels were altered in a style similar to the new cornice. On the tower, the two windows on the first floor were replaced with one larger window while the projecting bay over the east portico was removed and made flush {{with the rest of the}} house. The windows over that portico were replaced with a heavy double door that opened onto the roof over <b>the</b> <b>veranda,</b> which had been built over the entire front of the house. It was during this time that the first porte-cochere was built on the south side of the home.|$|E

5|$|The only area {{in which}} Keela and Eddie gave alerts was {{apartment}} 5A. Both dogs alerted behind the sofa in the living room, and on and under <b>the</b> <b>veranda</b> in the bedroom Madeleine's parents had used. The Polícia Judiciária obtained search warrants to search the house the McCanns had rented on Rua das Flores, and the silver Renault Scénic the couple had hired 24 days after Madeleine went missing. The house and grounds were searched on 2 August. The only alert was from Eddie when he encountered Cuddle Cat, which was lying in the living room; Keela did not give an alert. The police left with boxes of the McCanns' clothes, Cuddle Cat, a pair of latex gloves, suitcases, a notepad, two diaries, including one that Kate had started after the disappearance, and a friend's Bible she had borrowed. A passage the Bible's owner had marked from 2 Samuel, {{about the death of}} a child, was copied into the police case file along with a Portuguese translation. The items were taken to another location, where Eddie alerted to one of the boxes of clothes.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of the inter-island ferries, and at the instigation of the Harbour Board, the District Engineer requested authorisation from the Chief Civil Engineer {{for the removal of}} the redundant veranda on 30 September 1976 and was granted such permission on 26 October. On 17 May 1979 it was reported that part of <b>the</b> <b>veranda</b> had been removed but some of it remained as the area beneath it was being used as a car park. It was suggested that the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>veranda</b> be offered for sale to the Harbour Board or removed by the Department. The Harbour Board agreed to purchase <b>the</b> <b>veranda</b> and informed the Department of its intention to eventually demolish it as part of wharf reconstruction works. The Department later agreed on 14 August to transfer responsibility for <b>the</b> <b>veranda</b> to the Harbour Board at no cost.|$|E
25|$|The Stockmen's Bar and Grill is a brick {{structure}} with a saw-tooth roof in three bays which run {{at right angles}} to the street. The facade has been painted and the roof is concealed at the front by a very plain stepped brick parapet. In the centre of the front elevation is a large roller door flanked by two similar smaller doors on the left hand side and a standard sized door and a pair of triple projecting windows on the right hand side. These are supported on small brackets and are shaded by sun hoods. A timber veranda has been added {{to the rear of the}} building on the upper section and has a wheelchair access ramp. <b>The</b> <b>veranda</b> roof is supported on timber posts and has a timber handrail and dowel balustrade. The wall to the rear of <b>the</b> <b>veranda</b> is clad with weatherboards.|$|E
60|$|It {{was when}} all the equipages of the {{neighborhood}} had arrived that she climbed to her place; the ladder was taken away; the landlord spoke to his horses, and the Middlemount coach led the parade, amid the renewed slogans, and the cries and fluttered handkerchiefs of the guests crowding <b>the</b> <b>verandas.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For shophouses in Shanghai Street, {{necessary}} {{building services}} such as lifts, fire escapes and disabled access for the shophouses would be built in the 1960s buildings. The exact usage of the revamped shophouses has not been determined and is open to any options. One of the tentative suggestions is to house low-priced restaurant so that the public will have opportunities to use <b>the</b> <b>verandas.</b> <b>The</b> proposed aim is transforming Shanghai Street into a popular food street, or directly translated from the Chinese as [...] "Food Paradise".|$|R
