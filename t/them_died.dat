5|$|The fort {{was also}} used as a {{temporary}} naval hospital in the late 1820s and early 1830s, before Bighi Hospital was opened. During the cholera epidemic of 1837, patients who had contracted the disease at the Ospizio in Floriana were transferred to Ricasoli. Most of <b>them</b> <b>died</b> within a few days, and they were buried within the nearby Wied Għammieq cemetery. Another cholera epidemic broke out at Ricasoli in 1865.|$|E
5|$|As {{the road}} {{condition}} required extremely good driving skills, the China Relief Fund decided to test drivers {{and established a}} driving institute on a vacant piece of accessible land behind the Siong Lim Temple. Venerable Pu Liang, the monastery's 10th abbot, supported the China Relief Fund. Qualified volunteers from Nanyang converged in Singapore to form a batch. In 1939, about 3,200volunteers left in nine batches that included not only Chinese men, but also Indians, Malays, and four Chinese women. About 1,000 of <b>them</b> <b>died</b> in service, 1,000 settled in China and others returned to Nanyang after the war. The Venerable {{and two of his}} disciples were later arrested and executed during the Sook Ching Massacre in 1942.|$|E
5000|$|Make <b>Them</b> <b>Die</b> Slowly is {{the second}} studio album by White Zombie, {{released}} on March 22, 1989 by Caroline Records. It is named after the 1981 cannibal movie Cannibal Ferox, which was originally released in the US as Make <b>Them</b> <b>Die</b> Slowly. There is a printing error on the CD's side saying [...] "Let <b>Them</b> <b>Die</b> Slowly" [...] instead of the album's correct title. Produced by composer Bill Laswell and featuring John Ricci on guitar, the album represented a transition from the noise rock influenced sound of the White Zombie's previous albums to heavy metal, which informed much of their later work.|$|R

5|$|Before Æthelberht's {{death in}} 616 {{a number of}} other bishoprics had been {{established}} but after that date, a pagan backlash set in and the see, or bishopric, of London was abandoned. Æthelberht's daughter, Æthelburg, married Edwin, the king of the Northumbrians, and by 627 Paulinus, the bishop who accompanied her north, had converted Edwin and {{a number of other}} Northumbrians. When Edwin died, in about 633, his widow and Paulinus were forced to flee to Kent. Although the missionaries could not remain in all of the places they had evangelised, by the time the last of <b>them</b> <b>died</b> in 653, they had established Christianity in Kent and the surrounding countryside and contributed a Roman tradition to the practice of Christianity in Britain.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Osborn helped secure Beebe a new {{research}} station in Guiana to replace Kalacoon: Beebe was offered Kartabo Point, an outpost of a New York-based mining corporation. Beebe was {{enthusiastic about the}} new station, and it proved very successful for conducting the same detailed analyses of wildlife within small areas that had been performed at Kalacoon. At Kartabo Beebe discovered the phenomenon known as an ant mill, a column of ants following itself in an endless loop until nearly all of <b>them</b> <b>died</b> of exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Madagascar, the cyclone produced {{high winds}} and heavy rainfall.

Many fishermen in the area {{were not aware of}} the storm's approach, and several of <b>them</b> <b>died</b> as a result. About five days after Cyclone Ernest struck Madagascar, Tropical Storm Felapi struck the same general area, causing additional flooding. The combined effects of Ernest and Felapi killed 39people, injured 104, and left 214people missing as of February25, 2005. Later, the death toll was finalized at 78 in the International Disaster Database. The storms damaged 5,792buildings, and there were 32,191people left homeless. The floods damaged about 4,483hectares (11,078acres) of crop fields in southern Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|In the south, {{conditions}} {{conducive to}} the spread of malaria existed throughout Petén and Belize. At the time of the fall of Nojpetén in 1697, there are estimated to have been 60,000 Maya living around Lake Petén Itzá, including a large number of refugees from other areas. It is estimated that 88% of <b>them</b> <b>died</b> during the first ten years of colonial rule owing to a combination of disease and war. Likewise, in Tabasco the population of approximately 30,000 was reduced by an estimated 90%, with measles, smallpox, catarrhs, dysentery and fevers being the main culprits.|$|E
5|$|Only twelve {{men were}} picked up before the ship capsized and sank at 19:26, and five of <b>them</b> <b>died</b> after being rescued. Among the dead was one of Spee's sons, Otto von Spee. In total, 327 {{officers}} and men {{were killed in the}} battle. In the course of the engagement, Nürnberg had hit Kent thirty-eight times, but did not cause significant damage. One shell struck one of Kents casemate guns and ignited the propellant charges inside, but the magazine was flooded before the fire could destroy the ship. The sinking was commemorated in a painting entitled The Last Man by Hans Bohrdt, which depicted a German sailor waving the Imperial ensign as Nürnberg slipped beneath the waves.|$|E
5|$|Polish music, {{including}} orchestras, {{also went}} underground. Top Polish musicians and directors (Adam Didur, Zbigniew Drzewiecki, Jan Ekier, Barbara Kostrzewska, Zygmunt Latoszewski, Jerzy Lefeld, Witold Lutosławski, Andrzej Panufnik, Piotr Perkowski, Edmund Rudnicki, Eugenia Umińska, Jerzy Waldorff, Kazimierz Wiłkomirski, Maria Wiłkomirska, Bolesław Woytowicz, Mira Zimińska) performed in restaurants, cafes, and private homes, {{with the most}} daring singing patriotic ballads on the streets while evading German patrols. Patriotic songs were written, such as Siekiera, motyka, the most popular song of occupied Warsaw. Patriotic puppet shows were staged. Jewish musicians (e.g. Władysław Szpilman) and artists likewise performed in ghettos and even in concentration camps. Although many of <b>them</b> <b>died,</b> some survived abroad, like Alexandre Tansman in the United States, and Eddie Rosner and Henryk Wars in the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Raised by {{a family}} of Southerners in Kansas, Anderson began {{supporting}} himself by stealing and selling horses in 1862. After his father {{was killed by a}} Union loyalist judge, Anderson fled Kansas for Missouri. There he robbed travelers and killed several Union soldiers. In early 1863 he joined Quantrill's Raiders, a pro-Confederate group of guerrillas that operated in Missouri. He became a skilled bushwhacker, earning the trust of the group's leaders, William Quantrill and George M. Todd. Anderson's acts as a guerrilla led the Union to imprison his sisters; after one of <b>them</b> <b>died</b> in custody, Anderson devoted himself to revenge. He took {{a leading role in the}} Lawrence Massacre, and later participated in the Battle of Baxter Springs, both of which occurred in 1863.|$|E
5|$|Rather {{than going}} to war, Helmichis, Rosamund and their {{followers}} escaped to Ravenna, the capital of Byzantine Italy, where they were received with full honours by the authorities. Once in Ravenna, Rosamund was persuaded by the Byzantine prefect Longinus to kill Helmichis {{in order to be}} free to marry him. Rosamund proceeded to poison Helmichis, but the latter, having understood what his wife had done to him, forced her to drink the cup too, so both of <b>them</b> <b>died.</b> After their deaths, Longinus dispatched Helmichis' forces to Constantinople, while the remaining Lombards had already found a new king in Cleph.|$|E
5|$|The British cavalry {{became aware}} of the ponies in 1804, during the Peninsular War, and used them as pack animals during the conflict; most did not return to Ireland. The famine of 1845–1852 furthered their decline, as farmers who {{previously}} utilised <b>them</b> <b>died</b> or emigrated. In addition, Spanish donkeys were brought to the island to replace the ponies, and when peat declined as a fuel source, pack animals were no longer needed. In the 1850s, farms began to be consolidated, and more machinery and large draft horses were employed, further reducing the number of ponies needed. Consequently, the ponies were left to run feral, mostly ignored and sometimes shot at by locals.|$|E

5|$|Additional Waffen-SS {{units were}} added from the Ukrainians, Albanians from Kosovo, Serbians, Croatians, Turkic, Caucasians, Cossack, and Tatars. The Ukrainians and Tatars, who had {{suffered}} persecution under Stalin, were likely motivated primarily by opposition to the Soviet government rather than ideological agreement with the SS. The exiled Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Amin al-Husseini was made an SS-Gruppenführer by Himmler in May 1943. He subsequently used antisemitism and anti-Serb racism to recruit a Waffen-SS division of Bosnian Muslims, the SS-Handschar. The year-long Soviet occupation of the Baltic states {{at the beginning of}} World War II resulted in volunteers for Latvian and Estonian Waffen-SS units. The Estonian Legion had 1,280 volunteers under training by the end of 1942. Approximately 25,000 men served in the Estonian SS division, with thousands more conscripted into Police Front battalions and border guard units. Most of the Estonians were fighting primarily to regain their independence and as many as 15,000 of <b>them</b> <b>died</b> fighting alongside the Germans. In early 1944, Himmler even contacted Pohl to suggest releasing Muslim prisoners from concentration camps to supplement his SS troops.|$|E
5|$|Encounter {{was badly}} damaged while {{refitting}} at Malta {{a few weeks}} after arriving in the Mediterranean and was briefly reassigned to Force H after her repairs were completed before rejoining the Mediterranean Fleet later in the year. Late in the year, the ship was transferred to the Eastern Fleet at Singapore and spent several months in early 1942 on convoy escort duties under the control of American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM). She was one of the Allied ships retasked to intercept Japanese invasion convoys during the Dutch East Indies Campaign in February 1942 and participated in the Battle of the Java Sea. Encounter was sunk a few days later in the Second Battle of the Java Sea on 1 March and most of her crew was rescued by a Japanese ship the next day. About a quarter of <b>them</b> <b>died</b> in captivity {{before the end of the}} war in 1945. The ship's wreck was discovered in 2007 and had been almost totally destroyed by illegal salvagers by 2016.|$|E
5|$|Fearing the Greeks might {{attack the}} bridges across the Hellespont and trap his army in Europe, Xerxes now retreated {{with much of}} the Persian army back to Asia, though nearly all of <b>them</b> <b>died</b> of {{starvation}} and disease on the return voyage. He left a handpicked force, under Mardonius, to complete the conquest the following year. However, under pressure from the Athenians, the Peloponnesians eventually agreed to try to force Mardonius to battle, and they marched on Attica. Mardonius retreated to Boeotia to lure the Greeks into open terrain, and the two sides eventually met near the city of Plataea. At the Battle of Plataea, the Greek army won a decisive victory, destroying much of the Persian army and ending the invasion of Greece. Meanwhile, at the near-simultaneous naval Battle of Mycale, they also destroyed much of the remaining Persian fleet, thereby reducing the threat of further invasions.|$|E
