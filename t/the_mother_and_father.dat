25|$|Another {{evolutionary}} hypothesis for {{vulnerability to}} pre-eclampsia {{is the idea}} of ensuring pair-bonding between <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> and paternal investment in the fetus. Researchers posit that pre-eclampsia is an adaptation for the mother to terminate investment in a fetus that might have an unavailable paternal donor, as determined by repeated semen exposure of the paternal donor to the mother. Various studies have shown that women who frequently had exposure to partners’ semen before conception had a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia. Also, subsequent pregnancies by the same paternal donor had a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia while subsequent pregnancies by a different paternal donor had a higher risk of developing pre-eclampsia.|$|E
25|$|An IVF {{technique}} {{known as}} mitochondrial donation or mitochondrial replacement therapy (MRT) results in offspring containing mtDNA from a donor female, and nuclear DNA from <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father.</b> In the spindle transfer procedure, {{the nucleus of}} an egg is inserted into the cytoplasm of an egg from a donor female which has had its nucleus removed, but still contains the donor female's mtDNA. The composite egg is then fertilized with the male's sperm. The procedure is used when a woman with genetically defective mitochondria wishes to procreate and produce offspring with healthy mitochondria. The first known child to be born {{as a result of}} mitochondrial donation was a boy born to a Jordanian couple in Mexico on 6 April 2016.|$|E

All the kalfas in Esma Sultan's villa behaved toward this child as though she were a daughter of an Ottoman imperial princess, and indeed her disposition and manners were so lovely that they became devoted to her. In the mean time Princess Esma Sultan carefully arranged the training and education of Perestu. She had three brothers, Mustafa, Hüseyn and Hasan Bey, and two sisters, Fatma Gülcemal Hanım and Mihrifidan Hanım.|$|E

25|$|The {{interaction}} of overlapping citizens rights and laws {{has led to}} some cases of exploitation of loopholes to avoid {{the intention of the}} law. For example, the Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland was required to amend the potential for abuse of the rights of Irish citizenship to the right to abode in the United Kingdom. Before then, Irish citizenship was granted on the basis of jus soli (i.e. being born on the island of Ireland was reason in itself to be considered an Irish citizen). In one case, a Chinese migrant to the UK, living in Wales on Great Britain, chose to give birth to a child in Northern Ireland, on the island of Ireland, to take advantage of Irish citizenship laws. Consequently, her child was born an Irish citizen by virtue of jus soli and so was entitled to permanent abode in the UK even though the mother did {{not have the right to}} visit the Republic of Ireland. <b>The</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> then claimed the right to stay in the United Kingdom by virtue of being the guardians of a citizen of the European Union who would be unable to look after itself should they be deported.|$|E
25|$|Eagle Scout hat pins were {{produced}} from 1921 through 1958 with several variations. Eagle Scouts who earned additional merit badges were recognized using Eagle Palms, introduced in 1927. Adults who had earned Eagle Scout {{began to be}} recognized in 1934 with a red, white and blue ribbon bar. In 1940, a small eagle pin {{was added to the}} bar. Ribbon bars were replaced by embroidered square knot patches in 1947. Over the years, the knot was produced with various background colors to match the different uniforms. Although the Venturing and Sea Scout programs use different uniform shirts, the current knot is available only with a tan background that matches the Boy Scout uniform. When the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award (DESA) was created in 1969, a gold-colored eagle device was introduced for wear on the Eagle Scout square knot. The Eagle Scout Mentor pin was introduced in early 2004 in a gold-colored version. In early 2006 it was changed to a silver-colored antique finish to match <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> pins but in 2007 was changed back to gold-colored. In 2008, the National Eagle Scout Association (NESA) introduced a knot recognizing those Eagle Scouts who are life members of NESA; it uses the standard knot emblem with a silver border.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} ritual {{practices}} and beliefs {{are associated with}} birth among the Tanala. In the past, after delivery of a baby the mother would wash {{her hands in the}} blood of a freshly sacrificed chicken, bathe herself in hot water, and then rest upright beside a fire to make her sweat out impurities. The period that she needed to stay beside the fire varied; noblewomen might stay beside the fire for as long as several months, but more commonly the duration was eight days. Immediately after this period beside the fire was concluded, a party was held, which the mother had to attend regardless of her condition; the event was marked by the slaughter of zebu. Immediately after birth, the baby would be bathed in cold water, and a sorcerer would declare certain days to be lifelong fady (taboo days); if a baby was born on a day that was fady for both <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father,</b> the child would be abandoned to die. In addition, there are eight fady days per month for all Tanala, and historically if a child was born on one of these days, it would be drowned by holding its head in a water-filled winnowing pan.|$|E

In Part II, once Gaara begins to reveal his dreams and motivations to Kankuro, Kankuro becomes very protective of Gaara; he lashes out at anyone who speaks poorly of Gaara and when Gaara is kidnapped, he readily risks his life to save him. Kankuro is a talented puppeteer, normally using his bladed attack puppet [...] and trapping puppet [...] in combination attacks. He also possesses the large puppet [...] that provides him with combination defense and offense. After his puppets were destroyed by their creator, Kankuro gains a new puppet in Sasori's lifeless body [...] and modifies it for his use as a normal puppet.

[...] The BBC goes on to state, [...] "In practice, however, abortion is practiced in Hindu culture in India, because the religious ban on abortion is sometimes overruled by the cultural preference for sons. This can lead to abortion to prevent the birth of girl babies, which is called 'female foeticide'." [...] Hindu scholars and women's rights advocates have supported bans on sex-selective abortions.

2500|$|Since CAH is a {{recessive}} gene, both <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> must be recessive {{carriers of}} CAH {{for a child}} to have CAH. Due to advances in modern medicine, those couples with the recessive CAH genes have an option to prevent CAH in their offspring through preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). In PGD, the egg is fertilized outside the women's body in a petri dish (IVF). On the 3rd day, when the embryo has developed from one cell to about 4 to 6 cells, one of those cells is removed from the embryo without harming the embryo. [...] The embryo continues to grow until day 5 when it is either frozen or implanted into the mother. Meanwhile, the removed cell is analyzed to determine if the embryo has CAH. If the embryo is determined to have CAH, the parents may make a decision as to whether they wish to have it implanted in the mother or not.|$|E

However, in teaching children about sexual morals and birth control, Mormons parents have ranked among the lowest in comfort discussing these topics with their children among US parents of all religious affiliations. In discussing another method of family planning the church [...] "strongly discourages" [...] surgical sterilization like vasectomies and tubal ligation and only allows it for serious medical conditions after discussing it with a bishop. The LDS Church opposes elective abortion [...] "for personal or social convenience" [...] but states that abortion could be an acceptable option in cases of rape, incest, danger to the health or life of the mother, or where the fetus has been diagnosed with [...] "severe defects that will not allow the baby to survive beyond birth." ...|$|E
