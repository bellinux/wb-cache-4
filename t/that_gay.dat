5|$|In July 2013, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Gay</b> had tested positive for a banned substance, following which he withdrew from consideration for the World Championships in Moscow. The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) suspended him until June 23, 2014, and stripped him of his silver medal from the 2012 Summer Olympics as a result.|$|E

5|$|A Washington Post {{editorial}} {{asked why}} an apparently unstable Army private {{had been able}} to access and transfer sensitive material in the first place. According to her biographer, Manning's sexuality came into play by illustrating for the far right <b>that</b> <b>gay</b> people were unfit for military service, while the American mainstream thought of Manning as a gay soldier driven mad by bullying.|$|E

5000|$|Scruton argued further <b>that</b> <b>gays</b> have no {{children}} and consequently {{no interest in}} creating a socially stable future. He therefore considered it justified to [...] "instil in our children feelings of revulsion" [...] towards homosexuality, and in 2007 he challenged the idea <b>that</b> <b>gays</b> {{should have the right}} to adopt. Scruton told The Guardian in 2010 that he would no longer defend the view that revulsion against homosexuality can be justified.|$|R
5|$|A {{research}} paper published {{ten years after}} the storm suggested <b>that</b> <b>Gay</b> could have been stronger than Typhoon Tip, which attained the lowest barometric pressure ever recorded. While at its peak intensity, Gay registered a rating of 8.0 for nine consecutive hours using the Dvorak technique, indicating sustained wind speeds of at least (315km/h) 195mph. In addition, the cyclone had a significantly colder band of clouds around the eye. Typhoon Angela in 1995 presented similar features and could have been stronger than Gay. Neither of the two had direct observations into their eyes, however, making it impossible to confirm such intensity.|$|E
5|$|Despite the new {{leadership}} in the city, there were still conservative strongholds. One of Moscone's first acts as mayor was appointing a police chief to the embattled San Francisco Police Department (SFPD). He chose Charles Gain, against {{the wishes of the}} SFPD. Most of the force disliked Gain for criticizing the police in the press for racial insensitivity and alcohol abuse on the job, instead of working within the command structure to change attitudes. By request of the mayor, Gain made it clear <b>that</b> <b>gay</b> police officers would be welcomed in the department; this became national news. Police under Gain expressed their hatred of him, and of the mayor for betraying them.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} year of his life, Milk {{emphasized}} <b>that</b> <b>gay</b> people should be more visible to help to end the discrimination and violence against them. Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so: I cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. I can only hope that they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.|$|E

5000|$|A 1929 text called “The Love of The Third Sex” by Johanna Elberskirchen was {{shortened}} and {{featured in}} Die Freundin {{under the title}} “What Is Homosexuality?” It featured the idea that homosexuality is an innate, natural predisposition; and <b>that</b> <b>gays</b> formed a [...] "third sex.” This indicates that the philosophy of Die Freundin was {{in tandem with the}} current sexual-scientific theories of the time. This recognition of the “naturalness” of homosexuality lead to the conclusion <b>that</b> <b>gays,</b> including lesbian women, were entitled to full social recognition.|$|R
5|$|LGBT rights activists, {{human rights}} activists, {{and other critics}} stated that the broad and vague wording of the law, which was {{characterized}} as a ban on gay propaganda by the media, made {{it a crime to}} publicly make statements or distribute materials in support of LGBT rights, hold pride parades or similar demonstrations, state <b>that</b> <b>gay</b> relationships are equal to heterosexual relationships, or according to Human Rights Campaign (HRC) president Chad Griffin, even display LGBT symbols such as the rainbow flag or kiss a same-sex partner in public. The first arrest made under the law involved a person who publicly protested with a sign containing a pro-LGBT message.|$|E
5|$|Although Gay {{tended to}} be a slow starter on the track, he worked hard to improve and broke the Lafayette High School stadium record for the 200 meters. Under the tutelage of Ken Northington, a former 100-yard dash state champion, Gay began working on his {{technique}} and rhythm. By his senior year he was a more composed athlete and he focused on the 100 meters, winning the state championship in the event and setting a new championship record of 10.60s. In spite of this, his mother noted {{that he was not}} fully applying himself and was taking his abilities for granted. Gay was also not a studious child and he failed to achieve the grades needed to enter a Division I sports college. However, the Kentucky High School State Championships in June 2001 demonstrated his abilities: he won gold in the 100m, setting a new personal best and state record with 10.46s, a record which stands to this day. In the 200m he took silver with another new personal best of 21.23s. At a 2001 track event, Gay met trainer Lance Brauman and the college coach convinced him to attend Barton County Community College. It was here <b>that</b> <b>Gay</b> first met Jamaican sprinter Veronica Campbell-Brown, and the two formed a close bond, becoming training partners.|$|E
5|$|Lois {{hears about}} Brian on TV, and then discovers {{that her parents}} do not love each other, and even raised her {{to believe that a}} {{heterosexual}} couple who hate each other have every right to marry while a homosexual couple who love each other don't. Horrified, Lois changes her mind on same-sex marriage, deciding <b>that</b> <b>gay</b> couples who love each other {{have the right to be}} together. She returns to Quahog to convince Brian to free the mayor, saying that if he pursues this any further, he will be hurting his own cause. Brian agrees, and ends the hostage situation. Since it has distracted the town from the Dig 'Em scandal, Mayor West agrees to drop the ban on gay marriage. Brian gives him a key for a Volkswagen Scirocco, and West drops the hostage charges. Jasper and Ricardo get married in the backyard of the Griffin house.|$|E

25|$|Some sources state <b>that</b> <b>gay</b> {{and lesbian}} couples {{experience}} domestic violence {{at the same}} frequency as heterosexual couples, while other sources state domestic violence among gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals might be higher than among heterosexual individuals, <b>that</b> <b>gay,</b> lesbian, and bisexual individuals {{are less likely to}} report domestic violence that has occurred in their intimate relationships than heterosexual couples are, or that lesbian couples experience domestic violence less than heterosexual couples do. One study focusing on Hispanic men indicated <b>that</b> <b>gay</b> men are less likely to have been perpetrators or victims of domestic violence than heterosexual men but that bisexual men {{are more likely to have}} been both. By contrast, some researchers commonly assume that lesbian couples experience domestic violence at the same rate as heterosexual couples, and have been more cautious when reporting domestic violence among gay male couples.|$|E

25|$|However, some gay {{men such as}} Andrea Dworkin's husband John Stoltenberg {{are also}} {{critical}} of sadomasochism and pornography and agree with the radical feminist and lesbian feminist criticisms of these practices. Stoltenberg wrote that sadomasochism eroticizes both violence and powerlessness. The gay pro-feminist author Christopher N. Kendall wrote the book Gay Male Pornography: An Issue Of Sex Discrimination, advancing the idea <b>that</b> <b>gay</b> male pornography involved sex discrimination and should be banned under Canada's equality laws. He uses radical feminist theory {{to make the case}} <b>that</b> <b>gay</b> male pornography reinforces misogyny and homophobia.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{research}} consistently shows <b>that</b> <b>gay</b> {{and lesbian}} parents are as fit and capable as heterosexual parents, {{and their children}} are as psychologically healthy and well-adjusted as those reared by heterosexual parents.|$|E
25|$|Emerging {{research}} suggests <b>that</b> <b>gay</b> men from religious backgrounds {{are likely to}} come out online via Facebook and Blogs as it offers a protective interpersonal distance. This largely contradicts the growing movement in social media research indicating that online use, particularly Facebook, can lead to negative mental health outcomes such as increased levels of anxiety. While {{further research is needed}} to assess whether these results generalize to a larger sample, these recent findings open the door to the possibility <b>that</b> <b>gay</b> men's online experiences may differ from heterosexuals' in that it may be more likely to provide mental health benefits than consequences.|$|E

25|$|Some state <b>that</b> <b>gay</b> male porn {{generally}} pays men {{much more}} than heterosexual porn. Men who identify themselves as heterosexual but perform in gay pornography are said to do gay-for-pay. This means they perform in gay movies only for the paycheck.|$|E
25|$|December – Hinckley gave an {{interview}} in {{which he did not}} support same-sex civil unions and spoke against same-sex marriage.
