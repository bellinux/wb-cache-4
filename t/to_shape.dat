5|$|At a {{rehearsal}} {{for one of}} these entertainments, Ages Ago (1869), the composer Frederic Clay introduced Gilbert to his friend, the young composer Arthur Sullivan. Two years later, Gilbert and Sullivan would write their first work together. Those two intervening years continued <b>to</b> <b>shape</b> Gilbert's theatrical style. He continued to write humorous verse, stories and plays, including the comic operas Our Island Home (1870) and A Sensation Novel (1871), and the blank verse comedies The Princess (1870), The Palace of Truth (1870), and Pygmalion and Galatea (1871).|$|E

5|$|Chetro Ketl's {{walls were}} {{constructed}} using three bulk materials: stone, clay-sand, and water. Two types of stone were used: a hard gray-brown tabular sandstone {{that forms the}} bench above Chaco Canyon's cliffs, and a softer, tan, massively bedded sandstone that forms the cliffs themselves. Chacoans preferred the harder, tabular stone as it was easier <b>to</b> <b>shape,</b> but much of {{it had to be}} dug up and levered out of the ground with wooden poles. Because the massive tan stone of the cliff faces was easier to procure, but much more difficult to work, the Chacoans probably used it only after the more easily quarried gray-brown stone beds had been depleted.|$|E

He later attended the University of Wyoming, where he earned both a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Arts in political science. He subsequently started, but did not finish, doctoral studies at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.|$|E
5|$|If it {{is unclear}} what counts as science, how the process of {{confirming}} theories works, and what the purpose of science is, there is considerable scope for values and other social influences <b>to</b> <b>shape</b> science. Indeed, values can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus. For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on evolution, and values concerning social class influenced debates on phrenology (considered scientific at the time). Feminist philosophers of science, sociologists of science, and others explore how social values affect science.|$|E

However, Lassie was consistently depicted as caring, nurturing, and responsible with a commitment to family and community, often rescuing those in peril and righting wrongs. She was the perfect 'mother' within the American ideology of the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Replacement of the ship's -tall, -wide lower masts in {{wood was}} not feasible, {{so they were}} made of steel tube cut and welded <b>to</b> <b>shape,</b> with a ladder inside each mast to allow access to the {{platforms}} on the masts. The three masts and the bowsprit were stepped in place between September 1984 and February 1985. Warriors engines, boilers and auxiliary machinery were considered too expensive to rebuild, so replicas were built from sheet steel with a few components made from cast iron to duplicate the look of the real equipment. The replica engines can rotate slowly, using electrical power, to allow visitors to imagine how they might have looked in operation.|$|E
5|$|Six years later, the Court {{reviewed}} another restriction, {{this time}} concerning funding restrictions imposed {{by a public}} university. In the 1997 case Rosenberger v.

While the Court said the government could seek <b>to</b> <b>shape</b> funding to support a government message, such restrictive steps could not be imposed {{to the exclusion of}} a particular viewpoint.|$|E
