40|$|Rib waveguides are {{investigated}} as {{an alternative}} to strip waveguides for planar <b>trapping</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> of microparticles. Microparticles are successfully propelled along the surface of rib waveguides <b>and</b> <b>trapped</b> in the gap between opposing rib waveguides. The trapping capabilities of waveguide end facets formed by a single and opposing waveguide geometries are investigated. The slab beneath a rib waveguide continues to guide light after the end facet of a rib waveguide. Thus particles can be trapped in wider gaps formed by opposing rib waveguides than with strip waveguides. Rib waveguides were found more efficient in trapping a collection of particles in the gap and particles could be moved to different locations in the gap by changing the relative power in the two opposing rib waveguides. Numerical simulations are used to show that the trapping efficiency on the surface of rib and strip waveguides is comparable. The simulations also confirm the advantage of opposing rib waveguides for trapping particles in wide gaps. The low sidewalls of rib waveguides give low propagation losses and make it easy to integrate rib waveguides with other functions in a lab-on-a-chip where particle <b>trapping</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> is required...|$|R

50|$|Research on the Euplectella aspergillum (Venus' Flower Basket) {{demonstrated}} that the spicules of certain deep-sea sponges have similar traits to Optical fibre. In addition {{to being able to}} <b>trap</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> light, these spicules have a number of advantages over commercial fibre optic wire. They are stronger, resist stress easier, and form their own support elements. Also, the low-temperature formation of the spicules, as compared to the high temperature stretching process of commercial fibre optics, allows for the addition of impurities which improve the refractive index. In addition, these spicules have built-in lenses in the ends which gather and focus light in dark conditions. It has been theorized that this ability may function as a light source for symbiotic algae (as with Rosella racovitzae) or as an attractor for shrimp which live inside the Venus' Flower Basket. However, a conclusive decision has not been reached; {{it may be that the}} light capabilities are simply a coincidental trait from a purely structural element. Spicules funnel light deep inside sea sponges.|$|E

The {{first step is to}} control the position and speed of a single object precisely using the {{rotational flow}} by only one end effector. The next step is 3 D manipulation of multiple objects simultaneously as a group by transporting the end effector.

A working turnstile {{has yet to}} be built, despite the numerous technological applications available for such a device. The key difficulty in manufacturing a chemical turnstile is finding a medium which will <b>trap</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> atoms. Here we propose that ferroelastic twin walls are suitable for this role. Previous work shows that twin walls can act as two-dimensional trapping planes within which atomic transport is fast.

40|$|Lake {{sturgeon}} {{have been}} identified as a species of concern in the Great Lakes and their tributaries. As a result, the need for upstream and downstream fish passage at existing hydroelectric facilities has been identified as a measure to reduce habitat fragmentation and restore access to spawning and rearing habitat. The Menominee River has been identified as a key river in restoring lake sturgeon habitat. The Menominee River forms the border between northeaster Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The Menominee River is formed at the confluence of the Brule and Michigamme rivers and flows in the southerly direction for 118 miles before joining the waters of Green Bay. The Menominee/Park Mill Hydroelectric Complex consists of the Park Mill Dam and the Menominee Dam which are the first two barriers to upstream passage on the Menominee River. Design of the fish passage facilities at these projects is underway and Kleinschmidt Associates has been retained to perform the final design of Phase II of the project, a new state-of-the-art fish elevator with a <b>trap</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> facility. The new lift will be located in an unused turbine bay and will lift fish from the tailrace of the Menominee project into a sorting tank located {{on the first floor of}} the powerhouse. Fish will be sorted by biologists from the state and federal fishery resource agencies to remove invasive species such as sea lamprey, or held for screening and collection of sturgeon gametes. The desired fish will then be transported upstream of the Park Mill project. This presentation will focus on the conceptual design process, agency negotiations, the final design of the new fish elevator, and will discuss the layout of the new <b>trap</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> facility...|$|E

A 633 -nm He-Ne laser focused by a 40 x objective lens is used to transport the particles. Negative dielectrophoretic trapping is demonstrated in this paper. Our experiment results show that optical beam with power as low as 1 µW is sufficient to transport 25 -µmdiameter latex particles at a speed of 4. 5 µm/sec.

30|$|Using {{proposed}} equations, {{we could}} control {{the speed and}} position of a target object precisely by controlling an end effector motion. The rotational flow could control the speed of an object around the end effector by changing the frequency and the amplitude of the circular motion and then determine the final position by managing the performance time of the motion. In addition, we will extend flow control to the manipulation of multiple objects. The manipulation procedure is descried in Fig.  10. In order to <b>trap</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> multiple objects at the same time, first, an end-effector generates a rotational flow around the target objects (Fig.  10 b) and subsequently the end effector is transported to the desired location by the stage while maintaining the circular motion (Fig.  10 c). Finally, the end effector stops the circular motion when the targets reach the desired position (Fig.  10 d).|$|E
40|$|A new optical {{trapping}} design to transport gold nanoparticles using a PANDA ring resonator system is proposed. Intense optical {{fields in the}} form of dark solitons controlled by Gaussian pulses are used to <b>trap</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> nanoscopic volumes of matter to the desired destination via an optical waveguide. Theoretically, the gradient and scattering forces are responsible for this trapping phenomenon, where in practice such systems can be fabricated and a thin-film device formed on the specific artificial medical materials, for instance, an artificial bone. The dynamic behavior of the tweezers can be tuned by controlling the optical pulse input power and parameters of the ring resonator system. Different trap sizes can be generated to trap different gold nanoparticles sizes, which is useful for gold nanoparticle therapy.

40|$|Optical waveguides {{can be used}} to <b>trap</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> micro-{{particles}}. The {{particles are}} held close to the waveguide surface by the evanescent field and propelled forward. We propose a new technique to lift and trap particles above the surface of the waveguides. This is made possible by a gap between two opposing, planar waveguides. The field emitted from each of the waveguide ends diverge fast, away from the substrate and into the cover-medium. By combining two fields propagating at an angle upwards and coming from opposite sides of a gap, particles can be stably lifted and trapped at the crossing of the two fields. Thus, particles are transported by waveguides leading to a gap, where they are lifted away from the substrate and trapped. The experiments are supported by numerical simulations of the forces on the micro-particles. Fluorescence imaging is used to track the particles in 3 D with a precision of 50 nm...|$|E

It is shown that a nanoparticle can go along different paths before it gets trapped, strongly depending on its initial position relative to the integrated waveguide. Due to localized optical field enhancement on waveguide sidewalls, there are multiple trapping positions, with a critical area where particle <b>trapping</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> are unstable. As the water velocity increases, the effective trapping range shrinks, but with a rate that is smaller than the increasing of water velocity.
