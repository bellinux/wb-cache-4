2500|$|In November 2003 during {{testimony}} to the Saville Inquiry on the events of Bloody Sunday alleged former Chief of Staff of the IRA, Martin McGuinness, denied that he had ever read such a book before {{he claims to have}} left the IRA in the 1970s. McGuinness reportedly said: [...] "When I was in the IRA there was no such book, I don't know when it came into existence." [...] When asked what the phrase [...] "green book" [...] meant, he stated: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> the book was green." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rihanna {{began working}} on the new sound for her seventh studio album in March 2012, {{even though she had}} not yet begun recording. During the {{production}} of the album, several musicians and producers were recruited including American singer Mikky Ekko and producer Justin Parker. According to Ekko, the production of the album was massive, [...] "Their pace is insane. They had the studios we were working in booked out for three months, on a cycle. It was like nothing I had ever experienced before." [...] "Stay" [...] was written and produced by Parker, Ekko and Elof Loelv. Initially, when they wrote the song, Ekko didn't like it because of its vulnerability; however, collaborators convinced him to listen to [...] "Stay" [...] again. After another listen, he understood that the song is very important to him, [...] "The track had become so special to me as well, and knowing what the track means to me and what I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> to her too." ...|$|E
2500|$|Earnhardt is a {{longtime}} opponent of the modern display of the Confederate flag at NASCAR events. He wrote in his 2001 autobiography Driver #8 about his experience being asked about the flag in a Q at Richmond International Raceway the previous year. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> something different to me {{than it does to}} y'all..." [...] he responded. He has distanced himself from race fans who display the flag, telling Mike Wallace in 2004 [...] "It never really was me." [...] In 2006, Earnhardt told Dan Wetzel of Yahoo! Sports: [...] "We live in a country where you can speak freely and do as you may. I don't know (if) what that flag stands for is the same for me as it is the guy who might have it flying out there. I am not going to agree with everything everybody does all my life. So I don't have any control over it." [...] Following the Charleston church shooting in 2015, Earnhardt told reporters: [...] "I think it's offensive to an entire race. It does nothing for anybody to be there flying, so I don't see any reason. It belongs in the history books and that's about it." ...|$|E

They all know it is a hook and that if they bite the bait upon it they will be pulled out of the water. But they are curious to know what will happen to them afterward, and <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> happiness instead of death. So finally one takes the hook and disappears, and the others never know what becomes of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile Henchard {{was sitting}} up, {{thinking}} over his jealous folly in forbidding Farfrae {{to pay his}} addresses to this girl who {{did not belong to}} him, when if he had allowed them to go on he might not have been encumbered with her. At last he said to himself with satisfaction as he jumped {{up and went to the}} writing-table: [...] "Ah! he'll <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> peace, and a marriage portion--not that I don't want my house to be troubled with her, and no portion at all!" [...] He wrote as follows:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, do {{you think}} so? When I say [...] "The kingdom of God is {{salvation}}," [...] {{do you think}} it is? Have you even any clear notion of what I mean when I say it? Some of you have not, I am afraid; you cannot see at first sight what salvation and the kingdom of God have to do with each other. And why? You think salvation means being saved from hell, and going to heaven, when you die. And so it does: but I trust in God and in God's holy scripture, that it means a great deal more; for I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> being unfit for hell, and fit for heaven, before we die. At least, so says the Church Catechism, which teaches every little child to thank his Heavenly Father for having brought him into such a state of salvation in this life, even while he is young. Thanks be to The Spirit of God which taught our fore-fathers to put these precious words into the Church Catechism, to guard us against falling into the very same mistake as the Pharisees of old fell into, when they asked our Lord when the kingdom of God was to come. And, believe me, it is easy enough and common enough to fall into the same mistake.|$|E
5000|$|It is Lizzie, a [...] "full-blooded" [...] woman, who mediates {{the young}} girl's {{relationship}} to the traditional past. Lizzie not only represents an alternative to Gracie's dissolute lifestyle, but she also helps preserve the history and meaning {{of the lives of}} the women in the family by telling and retelling stories imbued with what she <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> to be an Indian woman. Years later, when Gracie is hospitalized, Lucie returns to Oklahoma, and with her return come the memories of childhood.|$|R

I love you better than all the world besides. Whom else have I to love at all? If you choose to <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> of me, now that I am so poor, I cannot help it.

6000|$|She was {{not able}} to think of a [...] "financial equivalent"--meaning a pecuniary equivalent--for her [...] "instruction in Christian Science Mind-healing." [...] In this {{emergency}} she was [...] "led" [...] to charge three hundred dollars for a term of [...] "twelve half-days." [...] She does not say who led her, she only says that the amount greatly troubled her. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> that the price was suggested from above, [...] "led" [...] being a theological term identical with our commercial phrase [...] "personally conducted." [...] She [...] "shrank from asking it, but was finally led, by a strange providence, to accept this fee." [...] "Providence" [...] is another theological term. Two leds and a providence, taken together, make a pretty strong argument for inspiration. I think that these statistics make it clear that the price was arranged above. This view is constructively supported by the fact, already quoted, that God afterwards approved, [...] "in multitudinous ways," [...] her wisdom in accepting the mentioned fee. [...] "Multitudinous ways"--multitudinous encoring--suggests enthusiasm. Business enthusiasm. And it suggests nearness. God's nearness to his [...] "little one." [...] Nearness, and a watchful personal interest. A warm, palpitating, Standard-Oil interest, so to speak. All this indicates inspiration. We may assume, then, two inspirations: one for the book, the other for the business.|$|E
6000|$|But again, page 12. thou seemest offended, because I say, [...] "They are deceived, {{who think}} to obtain {{salvation}} {{by following the}} law, which they call Christ, though falsely." [...] Why shouldst thou be offended at this, when the scripture saith plainly, [...] "That by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin" [...] (Rom 3:20). But this is thy frothy argument, [...] "The law convinceth, and is our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ; therefore the law is not taken away," [...] sayest thou. Friend, what is this to the purpose? must we seek for justification by {{the works of the}} law, because the law convinceth? you may as well say, we must seek for justification from our consciences, because they do convince: Now where the scripture saith, the law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ; do you <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>means,</b> we must be first fitted by purification of ourselves by, or according to the law, before we can be saved by Christ from the curse of the law? If you say, yea; then doth not this follow, that Christ Jesus did not come to save sinners, but to save the righteous; and if so, then you must say, that Christ, Peter, Paul, and all the servants of the Lord are liars, who have testified that Christ died not for the godly, but for the ungodly and sinners.|$|E
