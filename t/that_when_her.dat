Lee revealed <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>her</b> character took off her wedding ring in a 1982 episode, she was taking off her real wedding band.|$|E

[...] Her father in particular had great difficulty accepting his child as a daughter, but her family have since accepted this and show great pride in her career.|$|E
500|$|Alyssa then {{travels to}} the 1960s, where she enters the house of Dorothy Rand, a blind elderly woman and her son, Albert, and sees them murdered by a man known as Corroder, who throws them into a vat of acid. Alyssa destroys Corroder, and returns a lost shawl to Dorothy's spirit, freeing both herself and Albert. She then returns to the present, where The Dark Gentleman congratulates her on killing two Subordinates.

500|$|Lloyd and {{the troupe}} made their début at a mission in Nile Street, Hoxton, in 1880 and {{followed}} this with an {{appearance at the}} Blue Ribbon Gospel Temperance Mission later the same year. [...] Costumed by Matilda, they toured local doss-houses in East London, where they performed temperance songs, teaching people the dangers of alcohol abuse. [...] Eager {{to show off his}} daughter's talent, John secured her unpaid employment as a table singer at the Eagle Tavern in Hoxton, where he worked as a waiter. Among the songs she performed there was [...] "My Soldier Laddie". Together with her performances at the Eagle, Lloyd briefly contributed to the family income by making babies' boots, and, later, curled feathers for hat making. [...] She was unsuccessful at both and was sacked from the latter after being caught dancing on the tables by the foreman. She returned home that evening and declared that she wanted a permanent career on the stage. [...] Although happy to have her performing in her spare time, her parents initially opposed the idea of her appearing on the stage full-time. She recalled <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>her</b> parents [...] "saw that they couldn't kick their objections as high as [...] could kick [...] legs, they very sensibly came to the conclusion to let things take their course and said 'Bless you my child, do what you like'." ...|$|E
500|$|Magnus [...] "adores her {{daughter}} Ashley, respecting her independence and self-reliance – but that doesn't preclude some occasional mother-daughter friction". Tapping {{has said that}} there is a [...] "huge amount of respect" [...] between the two characters, adding [...] "Ashley knows <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>her</b> mother says she needs to do something then she says it for a reason. And Magnus has a huge amount of respect for Ashley because Ashley can do things that she can't." [...] Magnus made a hard choice of having Ashley even though she does not have her mother's longevity, and Magnus would outlive {{her daughter}}. In the first season Magnus recruits Will as her protégé. When asked what Magnus thinks of Will, Tapping stated [...] "I think Helen finds him fascinating. He's so idealistic, she sees in him all the qualities that she admires, but all the qualities that she knows will probably get beaten out of him over the course of time. His idealism and purity of thought and the way he analyses things... she absolutely respects that, but I think she also realises that there's going to come a time when he's going to become a bit jaded... There are a couple of episodes where there's been this bizarre sexual tension between the two of them... but generally there's just a huge healthy respect." [...] During a Blastr interview in 2011, Tapping further explains Magnus' relationship with Will; [...] "I love how this relationship has developed. [...] "It's been a really organic transformation of Will's character and Magnus. To actually bring somebody on board who, initially, it's all about teaching him the ropes. And then as the seasons have gone on he's come into his own. He's come into his own as a scientist. He's come into his own in terms of his relationship with the people in the Sanctuary." [...] Dunne meanwhile stated [...] "there's a nice synchronicity that has formed between the two characters. And really, they're two people that depend on each other for survival. And therefore, that's where the respect comes out of." ...|$|E

Tatiana Shram, a sister of victim Elena Shram, also stated in {{an interview}} that she saw Kozlov's name mentioned in court documents, and that Kozlov was reportedly aware of the murders, and was with the suspects just before her sister was murdered. Shram further stated that the investigators told her that Kozlov remains free because he [...] "did not murder anyone," [...] and <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>her</b> attorney attempted to bring up the matter in court, the judge [...] "asked him to sit down." ...|$|E

2500|$|A show insider {{said that}} Lynsey's {{departure}} [...] "has {{got to be}} soap's best kept secret" [...] as people were unaware Hassan was due to leave. To prevent details of her exit surfacing, Hassan postponed her leaving party with the cast until her last episodes had aired. Hassan {{said that she was}} often asked if she planned to stay with the serial and although she already knew she was leaving she had to [...] "play along with things" [...] and keep her exit a secret to maintain the [...] "big shock factor" [...] she wanted. The actress had previously misled the press, telling a reporter from What's on TV that she was happy to stay at Hollyoaks for the foreseeable future. In May, when questioned by an OK! columnist whether she planned to stay with the serial, Hassan had replied <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>her</b> contract ran out in August she would have to see what happens.|$|E
2500|$|The Senator explosion, as {{with the}} Gazelle 21 years before, was blamed on her engineer's having allowed low water in her boilers, so <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>her</b> engines were shut off, steam {{pressure}} built up too quickly, causing boiler failure. [...] Low water in the boiler was a situation where flames and hot gases from the firebox were allowed to have {{direct contact with the}} metal boiler tubes and other critical components when there should have been a barrier of water preventing this. [...] The result would be either weakening of the metal over time or too quick a buildup in steam pressure, either one causing failure of the boiler jacket, that is, an explosion. [...] Hunter, in his thorough survey on the subject, cautions however that low boiler water, while often a cause of an explosion, was not always a good enough explanation, and that it had been shown by experiments as early as 1836 that a well-filled boiler could still explode, and that overheating caused by low water in the boiler frequently but not always led to an explosion.|$|E
2500|$|The {{play was}} adapted {{into a movie}} {{of the same name}} in 1943, {{directed}} by Michael Curtiz, co-starring Joan Leslie and Ronald Reagan, who was then an army lieutenant. Kate Smith also sang [...] "God Bless America" [...] in the film with a backdrop showing families anxious over the coming war. The show became a hit movie and a morale-boosting road show that toured the battlefronts of Europe. The shows and movie combined raised more than $10 million for the Army, and in recognition of his contributions to troop morale, Berlin was awarded the Medal of Merit by President Harry S. Truman. [...] His daughter, Mary Ellin Barrett, who was 15 when she was at the opening-night performance of [...] "This is the Army" [...] on Broadway, remembered <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>her</b> father, who normally shunned the spotlight, appeared in the second act in soldier's garb to sing [...] "Oh, How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning," [...] he was greeted with a standing ovation that lasted 10 minutes. She adds that he was in his mid-50's at the time, and later declared those years with the show were the [...] "most thrilling time of his life." ...|$|E
