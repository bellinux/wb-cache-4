However, the use of protease inhibitor monotherapy could prevent or reverse adverse events related to long-term use of nucleoside analogues, such as lipoatrophy, renal adverse events, osteopenia, and anemia. A detailed MEDLINE search was conducted to identify randomized clinical trials of triple- combination treatment versus protease inhibitor monotherapy with detailed analyses of safety. Summary results from analysis of changes in body composition, changes in lipids, renal adverse events, and anemia were evaluated for patients taking either protease inhibitor monotherapy or triple therapy. In six trials with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry data available, the percentage of patients with lipoatrophy was significantly lower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> protease inhibitor monotherapy arms than the triple therapy arms (p = 0. 03). In these trials there was also no significant difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> risk of lipohypertrophy between protease inhibitor monotherapy and triple therapy arms. In one trial there was a higher risk of renal adverse events for patients taking <b>tenofovir</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> triple therapy arm.

In conclusion, there is a mixed pattern of changes in nucleoside analogue-related adverse events after switching from triple therapy to protease inhibitor therapy. The potential for safety benefits of stopping nucleoside analogues needs to be set against a higher risk of HIV RNA elevations during protease inhibitor monotherapy.

40|$|Experiments were {{undertaken}} {{to determine whether}} the site of the hypoglycaemic action of 5 -hydroxytryptophan (5 -HTP), a direct precursor of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT), was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central nervous system or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver.</b> <b>The</b> fall <b>in</b> blood glucose followed <b>the</b> rapid increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amount of 5 -HT both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain and <b>liver</b> after 5 -HTP injection into pargyline-treated and non-treated mice. Carbidopa, an inhibitor of peripheral aromatic amino acid decarboxylase, prevented the elevation of 5 -HT levels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver</b> of both pargyline-treated and non-treated mice. In contrast, carbidopa did not prevent but rather enhanced the elevation of 5 -HT levels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain of both groups of mice. Corresponding to the prevention of 5 -HT elevation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver,</b> <b>the</b> fall <b>in</b> blood glucose was prevented by carbidopa. These results support the idea that the accumulation of 5 -HT <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver</b> but not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain causes the hypoglycaemia induced by 5 -HTP...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> zinc {{concentration}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver</b> {{was significantly}} higher in mice at 12  h after the onset of restraint stress than that without stress. The IL- 6 protein level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> serum was transiently elevated at 3  h after the onset of restraint stress, and the IL- 6 -responsive zinc transporter Zip 14 mRNA <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver</b> was expressed markedly at 6  h. These results suggest that Zip 14 {{plays a major role}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mechanism responsible for accumulation of zinc <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver</b> under restraint stress...|$|R
40|$|Kupffer {{cells were}} {{selectively}} eliminated <b>in</b> mice by <b>the</b> intravenous administration of liposome-entrapped dichloromethylene diphosphonate. At 5 days, small peroxidase-negative and acid-phosphatase-weakly-positive macrophages appeared, increased in number, and differentiated into peroxidase- and acid-phosphatase-positive Kupffer cells. Repopulating small macrophages actively proliferated, {{and the number}} of Kupffer cells returned to the normal level by day 14. The numbers of macrophage precursors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver</b> as detected by the monoclonal antibodies ER-MP 20 and ER-MP 58 increased after liposome-entrapped dichloromethylene diphosphonate injection. ER-MP 58 -positive cells proliferated and differentiated into ER-MP 20 -positive cells and eventually into BM 8 -positive Kupffer cells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver.</b> Bone-marrow-derived ER-MP 58 -positive cells were also detectable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver</b> and differentiated into ER-MP 20 -positive cells, but they did not become BM 8 -positive macrophages. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA expression was enhanced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver</b> 1 day after injection. The administration of macrophage colony-stimulating factor did not shorten the period of Kupffer cell depletion but increased the number and the proliferative capacity of repopulating Kupffer cells. These findings implied that repopulating Kupffer cells are derived from a macrophage precursor pool <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver</b> rather than from bone-marrow-derived monocytes. Local production of macrophage colony-stimulating factor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver</b> plays a crucial role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> differentiation, maturation, and proliferation of Kupffer cells...|$|R
