5|$|Just beyond East Norwood, the Pennsylvania built McCullough Yard in 1927, {{improving}} switching {{operations for}} the growing industrial base in Norwood. A connection was included to the Pennsylvania's Chicago-bound Richmond Branch, which the CL crossed over north of the yard. In Butler County, north of Brecon, the CL curved abruptly northeast onto the original line, partially graded in the 1850s between Sharonville and Lebanon. Just beyond, it began to descend slowly through Mason to Hageman, where it crossed the Middletown Branch, and then rose slightly, alongside Turtle Creek, to Lebanon. The Pennsylvania <b>tore</b> <b>down</b> the original Lebanon passenger station in 1960, replacing it (for freight purposes) with a smaller building from Kings Mills on the Little Miami Railroad. The Lebanon Council of Garden Clubs acquired the land in 1972, <b>tore</b> <b>down</b> the freight depot, and erected {{a replica of the}} old passenger depot in its place, with a gift shop inside.|$|E
5|$|Governor Dinwiddie sent Captain William Trent {{to build}} a fort at the Forks of the Ohio. On February 17, 1754, Trent began {{construction}} of the fort, the first European habitation {{at the site of}} present-day Pittsburgh. The fort, named Fort Prince George, was only half-built by April 1754, when over 500 French forces arrived and ordered the 40-some colonials back to Virginia. The French <b>tore</b> <b>down</b> the British fortification and built Fort Duquesne.|$|E
5|$|The city of Bari, {{which had}} been {{the capital of the}} Byzantine Catapanate of Southern Italy for centuries before the arrival of the Normans, opened its gates to the Emperor's army, and the overjoyed {{citizens}} <b>tore</b> <b>down</b> the Norman citadel. After the fall of Bari, the cities of Trani, Giovinazzo, Andria, Taranto, and Brindisi were also captured. William arrived with his army, including 2,000 knights, but was heavily defeated.|$|E

5|$|The first Philippine provinces to be {{impacted}} by the typhoon were Albay and Catanduanes, which suffered power outages after strong winds <b>tore</b> <b>down</b> power lines. One person was killed in Virac, Catanduanes after being electrocuted by a felled power line. In order to prevent more widespread outages, electrical service in some locations was deliberately shut down. Landslides triggered by Nanmadol in Aurora killed 25people. On the Bicol Peninsula, eight fatalities occurred due to drowning, electrocution, or hypothermia.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Vlasic played college {{football}} at the University of Iowa. For four years, {{he served as a}} backup to Chuck Long, now a member of the College Football Hall of Fame. During his junior year, as the backup quarterback, he also served as the holder for field goal kicks. After placekicker Rob Houghtlin won a 12-10 game against the University of Michigan thanks to a last second field goal, a mob <b>tore</b> <b>down</b> the goalpost, which injured four fans including Vlasic, who was {{at the bottom of a}} pile of fans.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{this period of}} {{unanimous}} passion for Bashō's poems came to an end. Masaoka Shiki, arguably Bashō's most famous critic, <b>tore</b> <b>down</b> the long-standing orthodoxy with his bold and candid objections to Bashō's style. However, Shiki was also instrumental in making Bashō's poetry accessible in English, and to leading intellectuals and the Japanese public at large. He invented the term haiku (replacing hokku) {{to refer to the}} freestanding 5-7-5 form which he considered the most artistic and desirable part of the haikai no renga.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, {{the station}} was finally closed when Conrail and the newly formed Metro-North Railroad {{announced}} that the new stations along the Erie's former high speed freight line, the Graham Line, would take over freight and passenger service. Trains to Harriman would stop at a new park-and-ride built to the south. The former 1911 station depot, however, remained standing until 2006, when the Harriman village building inspector forced the new owners of the right-of-way for the old main line, Norfolk Southern, to either revamp or demolish the former station depot. The railway chose the latter, and in May 2006, a excavator <b>tore</b> <b>down</b> the 1911 depot, with the remains taken to a dump in nearby Hillburn.|$|E
5|$|On July 6, news reached New York that Congress {{had voted}} for {{independence}} four days earlier. On Tuesday, July 9, at 18:00, Washington had several brigades march onto the commons {{of the city}} to hear the Declaration of Independence read. After the end of the reading, a mob ran down to Bowling Green with ropes and bars, where they <b>tore</b> <b>down</b> the gilded lead equestrian statue of George III of Great Britain. In their fury, the crowd cut off the statue's head, severed the nose, and mounted what remained of the head on a spike outside a tavern, {{and the rest of the}} statue was dragged to Connecticut and melted down into musket balls.|$|E
5|$|In July 1978, amid a {{financial}} crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented the group with two original ideas for their next album. The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall, and the other would later become Waters' first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former to be their next album. Bob Ezrin co-produced, and he wrote a forty-page script for the new album. Ezrin based {{the story on the}} central figure of Pink—a gestalt character inspired by Waters' childhood experiences, the most notable of which was {{the death of his father}} in World War II. This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett. At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink <b>tore</b> <b>down</b> the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person.|$|E

5|$|In Constantinople, Justinian also <b>tore</b> <b>down</b> {{the aging}} Church of the Holy Apostles and rebuilt it on a grander scale between 536 and 550. The {{original}} building was a cruciform basilica {{with a central}} domed mausoleum. Justinian's replacement was apparently likewise cruciform but with a central dome and four flanking domes. The central dome over the crossing had pendentives and windows in its base, while the four domes over {{the arms of the}} cross had pendentives but no windows. The domes appear to have been radically altered between 944 and 985 by the addition of windowed drums beneath all five domes and by raising the central dome higher than the others. The second most important church in the city after the Hagia Sophia, it fell into disrepair after the Latin occupation of Constantinople between 1204 and 1261 and it was razed to the ground by Mehmed the Conqueror in 1461 to build his Fatih Mosque on the site. Justinian's Basilica of St. John at Ephesus and Venice's St Mark's Basilica are derivative of Holy Apostles. More loosely, the Cathedral of St. Front and the Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua are also derived from this church.|$|E
