To test for the putative implication of liver bile acids modifications in the selection effect of 2 -acetylaminofluorene, diethyl-nitrosamine-pretreated rats were fed a diet containing 1 % lithocholic acid, a treatment that induces essentially the same qualitative changes in liver bile acids, as 2 -acetylaminofluorene does: no selection effect of lithocholic acid could be demonstrated.

PKU diet has to be carefully planned, providing the best ingredient combinations, so that patients can achieve good metabolic control and an adequate nutritional status. Hereupon, it is mandatory to know the detailed composition of natural and/or cooked foodstuffs prepared specifically for these patients. We intended to evaluate sixteen dishes specifically prepared for PKU patients, regarding the nutritional composition, Phe and tyrosine (Tyr) contents, fatty acids profile, and vitamins E and B 12 amounts.

Although the formation of G-quadruplexes was demonstrated in vitro many years ago, it has not been definitively demonstrated in living human cells. We therefore investigated the chromosomal binding of a tritiated G-quadruplex ligand, 3 H- 360 A (2, 6 -N,N 0 -methyl-quinolinio- 3 -yl) -pyridine dicarbox-amide [methyl- 3 H]. We verified the in vitro selectivity of 3 H- 360 A for G-quadruplex structures by equilib-rium dialysis. We then showed by binding experi-ments with human genomic DNA that 3 H- 360 A has a very potent selectivity toward G-quadruplex struc-tures of the telomeric 30 -overhang. Finally, we per-formed autoradiography of metaphase spreads from cells cultured with 3 H- 360 A. We found that 3 H- 360 A was preferentially bound to chromosome terminal regions of both human normal (peripheral blood lymphocytes) and tumor cells (T 98 G and CEM 1301). In conclusion, our results provide evid-ence that a specific G-quadruplex ligand interacts with the terminal ends of human chromosomes. They support the hypothesis that G-quadruplex ligands induce and/or stabilize G-quadruplex structures at telomeres of human cells...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Phytothermotherapy (PTT) is a {{singular}} <b>treatment</b> <b>consisting</b> <b>in</b> immersing oneself in pools of fermenting alpine grass, to exploit its heat and rich aromatic components. The efficacy of PTT in rheumatic diseases (RD) is bolstered by ancient tradition. However, {{there is a}} marked lack of clinical validation of its efficacy and tolerability in current literature. The objective of this review was to summarize the actually available knowledges on possible effects of PTT in RD. Methodology: We conducted {{a search of the}} literature in May 2012. Medline was searched using the term "phytothermotherapy" and "hay baths" in combination with "rheumatic diseases", "fibromyalgia syndrome", "osteoarthritis". Results: We identified one article reporting the clinical effects of PTT in 56 patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and 3 trials describing the results of PTT in osteoarthritis (OA). The available data demonstrate that PTT is efficacy in decreasing pain and disability and improving function in patients with FMS and OA. Furthermore, the tolerability of PTT is excellent. The actual mechanism of action of PTT is yet not completely known, although it's probably due to different combined mechanical, physical and chemical effects. Discussion: PTT could represent a useful aid in the treatment of FMS and OA. However, further studies on a larger number of patients are needed to provide more precise therapeutic guidelines on the modalities of use of PTT. Additionally, {{there is a need for}} further botanical investigations and researches on the mechanisms of actions of PTT. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH...|$|E

In this work, we have at first demonstrated that polyetherimide/palladium acetate membranes of different porous microstructures could be successfully prepared from a cononsolvent process.

Background. -One of the main features of LEPs in migraineurs is a lower habituation to repetitive noxious stimuli during the interictal phase. Methods. -LEPs were recorded to stimulation of both the right hand and the right perioral region in 14 patients and in 14 healthy subjects. The habituation of both the N 1 and the vertex N 2 /P 2 components was assessed by measuring the LEP amplitude changes across 3 consecutive repetitions of 30 trials each. Results. -In the 8 patients who had clinically improved after treatment, the N 2 /P 2 amplitude habituation was significantly higher after treatment than before treatment following both hand (F = 43. 2, P <. 0001) and face stimulation (F = 6. 9, P =. 01). In these patients, the N 2 /P 2 amplitude habituation after treatment was not different from that obtained in healthy controls (P =. 18 and P =. 73 for hand and face stimulation, respectively). On the contrary, in the patients who did not improve, the N 2 /P 2 amplitude still showed reduced habituation after both hand (F = 3. 1, P =. 08) and face (F = 0. 7, P =. 4) stimulation.

40|$|Economic {{evaluation}} of therapeutic sequences {{in the treatment}} of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and coexisting conditionsIntroductionChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a chronic lymphoproliferative syndrome and it is the most common hematological malignancy in Western countries. It has a tendency to develop subsequent relapses, so affected patients are likely to undergo more than one line of treatment. MethodsRather than evaluating the cost-effectiveness of individual therapeutic agents, it becomes therefore recommendable for decision-makers to identify an optimal sequencing of such agents. A four-year cost-consequence analysis was conducted, comparing three alternative strategies for the first-line treatment of patients with previously untreated CLL and coexisting conditions: i) obinutuzumab with chlorambucil (Obi-Clb), ii) rituximab with chlorambucil (Rtx-Clb), and iii) ofatumumab with chlorambucil (Ofa-Clb). Only drug costs were considered in the analysis. ResultsIn two trials, median time to next treatment (TTNT) was longer in Obi-Clb (51. 1 months) as compared to Rtx-Clb (38. 2 months) or to Ofa-Clb (39. 8 months). Therefore, during a 48 -month time horizon, patients treated with Obi-Clb would maintain on average the first line treatment; on the contrary, patients treated with Rtx-Clb or with Ofa-Clb would receive on average a second line <b>treatment</b> <b>consisting</b> <b>in</b> the majority of cases of ibrutinib monotherapy, or rituximab with idelalisib or rituximab with bendamustine.

Sensitivity analyses on a couple of scenarios provided similar conclusions in terms of overall costs.
