5|$|Following a {{domestic}} violence case between Rihanna {{and her boyfriend}} American entertainer Chris Brown, media speculated as to whether any song featured on her fourth upcoming album would be about him. In an interview with MTV News, Ne-Yo clarified {{that he would not}} write a song for Rihanna about Brown, because he considered the idea unnecessary. Harmony said <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> song Rihanna released as a lead single from the album, it would be looked at as a song about Brown.|$|E
5|$|That wasn't just a {{faith in}} {{herself and her}} talent, but also the ability to let herself go, to pray to God, and to trust in what would happen. These were, by far, her most inspiring words to date, letting others know <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> they were doing, no matter how {{difficult}} things were, with help they would win through. Musically, the piece had a restrained dance beat, very Mowtownish, that owed {{a little more to}} gospel, with a chorus - sung by Mariah, Trey and Patrique - that rose gloriously from the verse to repeat and drive and its very positive message home.|$|E
5|$|The case {{attracted}} commentary by two contemporary writers. John of Salisbury, who was {{a secretary}} for Theobald, added information about Osbert {{in a letter to}} Alexander III on unrelated business. In the section of the letter, John pointed out to the pope <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> others might say about Osbert, he had failed to secure other clergy willing to swear that he was innocent. Another contemporary, Gilbert Foliot, who was Bishop of Hereford, wrote to the pope to remind him that although Osbert's accuser had offered to prove his accusations by undergoing a trial by ordeal, this was essentially meaningless since canon law forbade the clergy from the ordeal.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song, {{in a similar}} theme to many other tracks written by Ray Davies, say <b>that,</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what's</b> {{happening}} in the world, you must pick yourself up (since {{no one else is}} going to help you). The track also makes references to [...] "the fascists and the left wing militants", [...] "crooked politicians and the unemployment queues", and the Irish Republican Army, who, at the time, used illegal methods to attempt breaking away from Britain.|$|R

5|$|As {{part of the}} Nixon Doctrine {{that the}} U.S. would avoid direct combat {{assistance}} to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East—particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia—during the Nixon administration. The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage it. The president believed that—except during the Suez Crisis—the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge {{the parties to the}} negotiating table. The Arab-Israeli conflict was not a major focus of Nixon's attention during his first term—for one thing, he felt <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> he did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.|$|E
5|$|As George tells Jerry {{that his}} girlfriend no longer {{wants to see}} him, Jerry tells George that he gave away his ticket to Horneck. Although Jerry offers George his own ticket, George does {{not go to the}} game with Horneck because he does not know Horneck. Jerry decides to give Horneck both tickets, {{claiming}} that he cannot make the game because he is tutoring his nephew. Later, the night of the Knicks game,Jerry is in his apartment talking to his ex-girlfriend Elaine. She jokingly tries to add to Jerry's list of excuses with which he avoids Horneck. He later discovers that Horneck took Kramer to the game and that Horneck is in the building. When Horneck meets Jerry and Elaine, Horneck invites them out to another Knicks game. They come up with more unusual excuses in an attempt to avoid going out. However, Horneck then gets out a newspaper and tries to organize a time when they can all meet, weeks in advance. Jerry realizes <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> excuses he comes up with, he cannot avoid Horneck.|$|E

25|$|Even {{the very}} date {{of his death}} is uncertain, as some records say this took place in summer, while another dates it at October 8 (that is after middle of Japanese autumn). Before he died, Goemon wrote a famous {{farewell}} poem, saying <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what,</b> there always shall be thieves. A tombstone dedicated to him is located in Daiunin temple in Kyoto. A large iron kettle-shaped bathtub is now called a goemonburo ("Goemon bath").|$|E

Heisenberg did not care to formulate the uncertainty principle as an exact limit (which is elaborated below), and preferred to use it instead, as a heuristic quantitative statement, correct up to small numerical factors, which makes the radically new noncommutativity of quantum mechanics inevitable.|$|E

25|$|Some historians {{emphasize}} that Civil War soldiers were driven by political ideology, holding firm {{beliefs about the}} importance of liberty, Union, or state rights, or about the need to protect or to destroy slavery. Others point to less overtly political reasons to fight, such as the defense of one's home and family, or the honor and brotherhood to be preserved when fighting alongside other men. Most historians agree <b>that,</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> he thought about when he went into the war, the experience of combat affected him profoundly and sometimes affected his reasons for continuing to fight.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle {{held more}} {{accurate}} theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day. The second oldest written {{evidence of a}} camera obscura (after Mozi c. 400 BC) {{can be found in}} Aristotle's documentation of such a device in 350BC in Problemata. Aristotle's apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole, or aperture, to allow for sunlight to enter. Aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> shape the hole was, the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object. In modern cameras, this is analogous to the diaphragm. Aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased, the image was magnified.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem is}} to {{estimate}} separately the number of numbers ≤ x with no prime divisors ≤ x1/2, that have an even (or an odd) number of prime factors. It can be shown <b>that,</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> the choice of weights in a Brun- or Selberg-type sieve, the upper bound obtained {{will be at least}} (2 + o(1)) x / ln x for both problems. But in fact the set with an even number of factors is empty and so has size 0. The set with an odd number of factors is just the primes between x1/2 and x, so by the prime number theorem its size is (1 + o(1)) x / ln x. Thus these sieve methods are unable to give a useful upper bound for the first set, and overestimate the upper bound on the second set by a factor of 2.|$|E

25|$|In the 1964 presidential campaign, Johnson restated his {{determination}} to provide measured support for Vietnam while avoiding another Korea; but privately he {{had a sense of}} foreboding about Vietnam—a feeling <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> he did things would end badly. Indeed, his heart was on his Great Society agenda, and he even felt that his political opponents favored greater intervention in Vietnam in order to divert attention and resources away from his War on Poverty. The situation on the ground was aggravated in the fall by additional Viet Minh attacks on US ships in the Tonkin Gulf, as well as an attack on Bien Hoa Air Base in South Vietnam. Johnson decided against retaliatory action at the time after consultation with the Joint Chiefs and also after public pollster Lou Harris confirmed that his decision would not detrimentally affect him at the polls. By the end of 1964, there were approximately 23,000 military personnel in South Vietnam. U.S. casualties for 1964 totaled 1,278.|$|E
25|$|Edge colorings of {{complete}} graphs {{may be used}} to schedule a round-robin tournament into as few rounds as possible so that each pair of competitors plays each other in one of the rounds; in this application, the vertices of the graph correspond to the competitors in the tournament, the edges correspond to games, and the edge colors correspond to the rounds in which the games are played. Similar coloring techniques may also be used to schedule other sports pairings that are not all-play-all; for instance, in the National Football League, the pairs of teams that will play each other in a given year are determined, based on the teams' records from the previous year, and then an edge coloring algorithm is applied to the graph formed by the set of pairings in order to assign games to the weekends on which they are played. For this application, Vizing's theorem implies <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> set of pairings is chosen (as long as no teams play each other twice in the same season), it is always possible to find a schedule that uses at most one more weekend than there are games per team.|$|E

25|$|With Anna in chains, Ingrid asks Anna {{to recall}} {{the tale of a}} king who lost his only daughter, and as a result, used a mirror to cast a spell on his whole kingdom, making them see only the worst qualities in those around them, leading them to kill each other. Ingrid uses a small shard of the mirror to cast the same spell, the Spell of Shattered Sight, on Anna, {{resulting}} in Anna becoming negative and resentful against Elsa for deserting her during their childhood. Elsa suspects a spell has been cast on her sister when Anna comes to the dining room carrying the urn and saying only negative things about her. Ingrid demands that Elsa freeze Anna to prevent her from trapping Elsa inside of the urn; however, Elsa refuses to hurt her sister, crossing her arms to hold in her magic. Still under the spell, Anna traps Elsa inside the urn, even as Elsa tells her <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> she does, she will always love her. Anna realizes too late what she has done when Ingrid takes the urn from her, and Kristoff arrives to stop Ingrid. Unfortunately, Elsa's entrapment was not Ingrid's original plan, and in her anger, she uses her powers to freeze Anna, Kristoff, and the entire Kingdom of Arendelle. Rumplestiltskin appears in the dining room, finding Ingrid practicing her Rock Troll magic, pulling memories from Elsa, still inside the urn, over to a rock in her other hand. Rumplestiltskin asks her to give him the Sorcerer's Hat box; when she refuses, he magically takes and hides the urn and Anna's necklace, saying he will return them only in exchange for the box.|$|E
