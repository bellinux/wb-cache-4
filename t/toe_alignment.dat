For instance, a scan may be loaded into the system in a prone position rather than supine, and PET correspondence of the anatomical image may be aligned in opposite direction (head to <b>toe</b> <b>alignment),</b> considering all these issues in a fully automated way requires an extensive search and individualized event detection algorithms. It may take longer for a fully automated computer algorithm to identify these problems first and take the appropriate actions due {{to the difficulty of}} ‘recognizing’ an unexpected problem. On the other hand, a human observer can easily handle these issues by visual inspection and take the necessary action within seconds. This {{is one of the main}} reasons that many research tools, including our proposed computational framework, are being developed in a way to allow users to efficiently interact with the tools [...]...|$|E
25|$|Injuries due to toe {{misalignment}} {{are often}} avoided by adjusting <b>toe</b> <b>alignments</b> with gel <b>toe</b> spacers. Toenail bruising {{can be caused}} by heavy pressure {{on the surface of the}} nail; this is typically prevented by keeping toenails clipped short, by wrapping tape around the toes, by using padding, or combinations of these. Bruising can also occur on the tips of the toes, especially when no padding is used. It is highly unadvised to dance en pointe without any padding at all.|$|R
25|$|Gel toe spacers {{of various}} {{shapes and sizes}} are {{inserted}} between toes; these serve to adjust <b>toe</b> spacing and <b>alignment</b> so as to alleviate pain at the bunion joint between the big toe and first toe.|$|R
50|$|A. J. Foyt's day ended {{just short}} of the midway point. A failed {{transmission}} linkage prevented him from pulling out of the pits. Foyt famously climbed from the cockpit, grabbed a hammer and a screwdriver, and started pounding away at the rear mechanics of the car. His attempts were futile, and the car was wheeled back to the garage area. Foyt revealed, during an interview immediately thereafter, that the Cogan crash had damaged the car's <b>toe</b> in <b>alignment,</b> and that it had been handling poorly all race up to that point. The 1982 race would be the final Indy 500 Foyt would lead during his driving career.|$|R
50|$|Anatomically, the {{evolution}} of bipedalism {{has been accompanied by}} a large number of skeletal changes, not just to the legs and pelvis, but also to the vertebral column, feet and ankles, and skull. The femur evolved into a slightly more angular position to move the center of gravity toward the geometric center of the body. The knee and ankle joints became increasingly robust to better support increased weight. To support the increased weight on each vertebra in the upright position, the human vertebral column became S-shaped and the lumbar vertebrae became shorter and wider. In the feet the big <b>toe</b> moved into <b>alignment</b> with the other toes to help in forward locomotion. The arms and forearms shortened relative to the legs making it easier to run. The foramen magnum migrated under the skull and more anterior.|$|R
