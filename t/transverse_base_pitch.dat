It is a dimension measured along a line or curve in the transverse, normal, or axial directions.

40|$|As {{the energy}} demand and {{greenhouse}} gases emission is increasing day by day the popularity of renewable energy systems is also being raised. One {{of the most popular}} renewable energy systems over the past decade has been the wind energy or wind turbines. Wind turbine extracts kinetic energy from the wind. Currently much research has concentrated on improving the aerodynamic performance of wind turbine. Variable speed horizontal axis wind turbines use blade pitch control to meet specified objectives for three regions of operation named low wind, medium wind and high wind conditions. In this paper a control strategy is being developed for variable speed horizontal axis wind turbine which will allow the turbine to run at its maximum efficiency. For this purpose the PID controller <b>based</b> <b>pitch</b> actuator system is used to control the aerodynamic power of wind turbine. MATLAB Simulink power system tool is used to develop the model of PID controller. In this paper a model for the simulation of the PID controller <b>based</b> <b>pitch</b> actuator system is constructed using properly selected sub blocks. Step response of this PID controller <b>based</b> <b>pitch</b> actuator system will be analyzed. The above presented model can be a useful tool for wind power industry to study the behavior of wind turbines...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHarmony search (HS), as an {{emerging}} metaheuristic technique mimicking the improvisation behavior of musicians, has demonstrated strong efficacy in solving various numerical and real-world optimization problems. This work presents a harmony search with differential mutation <b>based</b> <b>pitch</b> adjustment (HSDM) algorithm, which improves the original pitch adjustment operator of HS using the self-referential differential mutation scheme that features differential evolution - another celebrated metaheuristic algorithm. In HSDM, the differential mutation <b>based</b> <b>pitch</b> adjustment can dynamically adapt {{the properties of}} the landscapes being explored at different searching stages. Meanwhile, the pitch adjustment operator's execution probability is allowed to vary randomly between 0 and 1, which can maintain both wild and fine exploitation throughout the searching course. HSDM has been evaluated and compared to the original HS and two recent HS variants using 16 numerical test problems of various searching landscape complexities at 10 and 30 dimensions. HSDM almost always demonstrates superiority on all test problems...|$|R

40|$|Much {{research}} has shown that the voice source has strong influence on the quality of speech processing [4][5][6]. But in most of the existing speech modification algorithms, the effect of the voice source variation is neglected. This work explains why the existing modification scheme can't truly reflect the voice source variation during pitch modification. We use synthesized voiced speech sound to compare an existing pitch modification scheme with our proposed voice source scaling based modification scheme. Results show that voice source scaling <b>based</b> <b>pitch</b> modification can be used for wider range pitch modification...|$|R

40|$|This talk {{reports on}} recent work where we studied the {{connection}} between the description of semi-inclusive DIS at high <b>transverse</b> momentum (<b>based</b> on collinear factorization) and low <b>transverse</b> momentum (<b>based</b> on transversemomentum-dependent factorization). We used power counting to determine the leading behavior of the structure functions at intermediate transverse momentum in the two descriptions. When the power behaviors are different, two distinct mechanisms are present and there can be no matching between them. When the power behavior is the same, the two descriptions must match. An explicit calculation however shows that for some observables this is not the case, suggesting that the transverse-momentum-dependent-factorization description beyond leading twist is incomplete. 1...|$|R

It {{was found}} that laminar composites could be fabricated using either pristine or intercalated graphite fibers using standard fabrication techniques. The intercalated graphite fiber composites had electrical properties which were markedly improved over both the corresponding <b>pitch</b> <b>based</b> and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based composites. Despite composites resistivities more than {{an order of magnitude}} lower for <b>pitch</b> <b>based</b> fiber composites, the lightning strike resistance was poorer than that of the Pan based fiber composites.
