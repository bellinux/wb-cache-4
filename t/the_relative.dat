40|$|A {{positive}} {{family history}} {{is associated with}} increased risk for dementia. It is not known whether a negative family history with long-lived relatives predicts a reduced risk for dementia. We studied the survival rate and the occurrence of dementia in 232 parents and siblings of 43 optimally healthy individuals > or = 84 {{years of age and}} compared them with 233 parents and siblings of 51 random controls and 499 parents and siblings of 88 Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. Prevalence of dementia after age 60 years was. 031 for <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> of healthy elderly,. 066 for <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> of random controls, and. 217 for <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> of AD patients. The cumulative incidence of dementia by age 85 years was estimated as. 041 (+/-. 019) for <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> of healthy elderly individuals,. 102 (+/-. 038) for <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> of random controls, and. 360 (+/-. 037) for <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> of AD patients. Hazard-ratio estimates suggest that the risk of dementia for <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> of healthy elderly is 3 times lower than the risk for <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> of random controls (P <. 03) and is 11 times lower than the risk for <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> of AD patients (P <. 00005).

Method: This is a descriptive study with a qualitative approach. Data were collected from relatives of patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit of a university hospital, through a semi-structured interview. The findings were analyzed according to the Content Analysis theoretical framework. Results: Data show that <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> experience contradictory feelings {{with regard to the}} intensive care unit. Although <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> perceive it as a sector where fear of death prevails, they also see it as the sector where one finds the best quality of care. <b>The</b> <b>relatives</b> show, particularly, a need for interaction with the multiprofessional team, through an effective communication with the professionals. Conclusion: One concludes that there’s a need for establishing an effective dialogic process along with <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> of patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit, in order to enable them to experience this period in a smoother manner...|$|R

5|$|A full {{data set}} may consist of {{hundreds}} of separate images taken at different orientations of the crystal. The {{first step is to}} merge and scale these various images, that is, to identify which peaks appear in two or more images (merging) and to scale <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> images so that they have a consistent intensity scale. Optimizing the intensity scale is critical because <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> intensity of the peaks is the key information from which the structure is determined. The repetitive technique of crystallographic data collection and the often high symmetry of crystalline materials cause the diffractometer to record many symmetry-equivalent reflections multiple times. This allows calculating the symmetry-related R-factor, a reliability index based upon how similar are the measured intensities of symmetry-equivalent reflections, thus assessing the quality of the data.|$|E

40|$|The overall aim of {{the study}} was to explore and {{describe}} the views and experiences that <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> of <b>the</b> elderly living in nursing homes and the home's staff had about each other. A qualitative approach guided the methods used in the five studies. Tape-recorded, faceto-face interviews were conducted in four studies: studies I and III focused on the relatives' views of the staff-, studies IV and V focused on the staff's, RNs and LPNs views of <b>the</b> <b>relatives.</b> A non- participant observation was used in study II, which was based on group discussions between <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> of nursing home residents and the home's staff. Data from the interviews and notes from the observations were transcribed verbatim. The text was subjected to a qualitative content analysis. Findings. Almost all of <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> said in <b>the</b> beginning of the interviews that the staff was nice. But usually they gave examples of situations that could be understood as questioning, disappointing and sometimes frustrating. Narratives that included negative views of the staff and their activities were often explained in a way that reduced personal criticism. Many <b>relatives</b> expressed that <b>the</b> staff seldom received credit for their difficult jobs. <b>The</b> <b>relatives</b> were generally satisfied with the physical care of the resident, but had many comments about the staff s abilities to attend to the resident's psychosocial care. Some relatives deliberately invested efforts to develop a positive relationship with the staff to advocate and monitor the resident's care. <b>The</b> <b>relatives</b> were uncertain about if and how the staff took advantage of their information about the resident, or if the information was passed on to other staff members. <b>The</b> <b>relatives</b> found it difficult to get adequate information, which contributed to feelings of uncertainty - a common theme in <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> narrative (I-III). In general the staff (registered nurses, RNs and licensed practical nurses, LPNs) had positive attitudes about <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> but also described them as rather demanding, taking up their time and sometimes trying their patience. The RNs recognised that <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> were a part of their work; low- priority work that was not often rewarded by their peers and managers (IV). <b>The</b> staff viewed <b>relatives</b> differently regarding age and gender. <b>The</b> younger <b>relatives</b> were more knowledgeable and knew what they could ask for. They did not tolerate shortcomings like <b>the</b> older <b>relatives.</b> <b>The</b> women paid more attention to the practical matters than <b>the</b> men. <b>Relatives</b> were regarded as a resource for both the residents' psychosocial wellbeing and contributing to hands-on care, provided that the RNs were aware that <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> knew what they were doing and did not risk harming themselves or the resident (IV). The LPNs restricted the relatives' involvement to care that did not hinder their work (V). There were doubts about whether or not relatives knew what kind of care could be expected in a nursing home setting. The relatives' wishes for the resident were sometimes interpreted as an expression of their own needs (IV). The staff thought that they knew some of the residents' needs and preferences better than <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> did at <b>the</b> moment. The staff understood that <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> could sense and take into consideration that they were under stress. <b>The</b> <b>relatives</b> were described as vague in their requests and questions. The staff explained that the relatives' awkward behaviour was understandable because they were going through a hard time. Conclusions. The interactions and relationships between <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> and staff are heavily dependent on how the communication between them develops. The findings in this thesis directly attend to the importance that the staff bears this in mind. Thereby measures should be taken to facilitate communication that has concordance between content and behaviour, leaving little room for uncertainty...|$|R

40|$|This is a {{qualitative}} study that explores {{the involvement of}} <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> in <b>the</b> special housing based on the perspective of fourteen interviewees working in elderly care, at special housing. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze the nursing staff's view of the involvement of <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> and <b>the</b> presence of care provision at special housing. The study is to find out what can constitute support or obstacles to <b>the</b> <b>relatives.</b> Three questions have been presented as the structural basis upon which the objective finds its conclusion. These questions try to explore and identify the forms of support that can help relatives in their involvement in elderly care. There are opportunities and obstacles for the involvement of <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> in <b>the</b> care of the elderly as well as expectations of nursing staff on the role of <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> in <b>the</b> care of the elderly which the following study focuses on. The research reflected in this study involves the care staff and their experiences and views on <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> who have their older live permanently in residential care. In conclusion, the study identifies similar reasoning among respondents regarding to key aspects of <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> at <b>the</b> special housing. They emphasizes that relatives are needed there and they are important resource for both the residents and the staff. The results indicate that there may be both opportunities and obstacles for the involvement of <b>the</b> <b>relatives.</b> On one side, factors that prevent relatives from their involvement are lack of communication, poor attitude, different views of relatives and staff about care and conflicts between them. On the other side, there are opportunities that can facilitate relatives' involvement, namely the fact that they need support from the staff. The interviewees pointed out that <b>the</b> relationship between <b>relatives</b> and <b>the</b> elderly is the basis of the relatives' involvement...|$|R
