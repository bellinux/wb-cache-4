5|$|Alessandro Farnese, as Paul III, was {{the last}} of the popes {{appointed}} by the ruling Medici family of Florence. He was socially ambitious, a careerist and not particularly pious. He kept a concubine, fathered four children out of wedlock and viewed the throne as an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>his</b> coffers while he placed his relatives in high positions. A talented and cunning political operator, Paul was precisely the sort of man the Florentines needed to assist them in their defence against French and Spanish threats.|$|E
5|$|Chief Justice Morrison Waite died a {{few months}} later, and Cleveland {{nominated}} Melville Fuller <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>his</b> seat on April 30, 1888. Fuller accepted. He had previously declined Cleveland's nomination to the Civil Service Commission, preferring his Chicago law practice. The Senate Judiciary Committee spent several months examining the little-known nominee, before the Senate confirmed the nomination 41 to 20.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Crawford became {{involved}} with the Pepsi-Cola Company through her marriage to company Chairman Alfred Steele. After his death in 1959, Crawford was elected <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>his</b> vacancy {{on the board of}} directors but she was forcibly retired in 1973. After the release of the British horror film Trog in 1970, Crawford retired from the screen. Following a public appearance in 1974, after which unflattering photographs were published, Crawford withdrew from public life and became increasingly reclusive until her death in 1977.|$|E

6000|$|... "That'll do now," [...] said Larry in {{a decided}} tone, as {{he rose and}} {{stretched}} himself, preparatory <b>to</b> <b>filling</b> <b>his</b> beloved pipe--"not a dhrop nor a bite more on any account." ...|$|R

5|$|On November 6, 2008, Emanuel {{accepted}} {{the position of}} White House Chief of Staff for US President Barack Obama. He resigned his congressional seat effective January 2, 2009. A special primary <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>his</b> vacated congressional seat was held on March 3, 2009, and the special general election on April 7. John Fritchey, a candidate for that seat, said at a forum that Emanuel had told him he {{may be interested in}} running for the seat again in the future.|$|E
5|$|When Flem D. Sampson {{was elected}} {{governor}} in 1927, he appointed Willis <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>his</b> {{seat on the}} Kentucky Court of Appeals. In 1928, Willis was elected to a full four-year term representing the Court's Seventh Appellate District. Holding a state-level office increased his political stature, as did revising Thornton on the Law of Oil and Gas, a six-volume law reference, during his time on the bench. His political image was not badly tarnished when he lost his seat on the court to Alex Ratliff during the Democratic surge that swept Franklin D. Roosevelt into the presidency in 1932. Following this defeat, {{he returned to his}} private practice.|$|E
5|$|When Ohno {{was very}} young, his father meticulously {{researched}} childcare providers {{to care for}} his son during his long work hours. As he grew older, his father became concerned his son would become a latchkey kid, so he got his son involved with competitive swimming and quad-speed roller skating at age 6. He later switched from the instruction of Benton Redford, a National Champion, to a team in Federal Way, WA called Pattisons Team Extreme and became a national inline speedskating champion and record holder himself. His father used Inline Speedskating <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>his</b> spare time. Ohno's days were spent with morning swimming practices, followed by schooling, and finally skating practices in the afternoon.|$|E
60|$|Seth Jepson {{was not as}} averse <b>to</b> <b>filling</b> <b>his</b> stomach as were we, and ate greedily when Harvey fed him, while Master Lord {{positively}} {{refused to}} accept a mouthful of anything save water, of which he drank eagerly at short intervals, thus telling me that there was, despite all his brave words, a fear in his heart which parched his tongue.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Scutts, in {{a feeble}} voice, thanked him, and lay with a twisted {{smile on his}} face {{listening}} to his wife's vivid narrative to the little crowd which had collected at the front door. She came back, followed by the next-door neighbour, Mr. James Flynn, whose offers of assistance ranged from carrying Mr. Scutts out pick-a-back when he wanted to take the air, <b>to</b> <b>filling</b> <b>his</b> pipe for him and fetching his beer.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you don't}} {{feel as if}} it was kind of meechin', our takin' up with his offer, after what's--" [...] Whitwell delicately forbore <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> out <b>his</b> sentence.|$|R
5|$|A {{week after}} the election, Clay resigned, but Crittenden now {{declined}} the appointment <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>his</b> unexpired term. Instead, the legislature elected Dixon to the remainder of Clay's term, set to expire in March 1855. Three weeks before Clay's death in 1852, he sent for Crittenden, and the two were reconciled; Critteden delivered a eulogy for Clay in September 1852, publicly dispelling the feud. After Clay's death, Crittenden became the most prominent Whig leader in Kentucky. He encouraged the party to support the nomination of Millard Fillmore for the presidency in 1852, but the nomination ultimately went to Winfield Scott. Crittenden was proposed as the nominee for vice-president, but he declined. Democrat Franklin Pierce carried the state by 2,700 votes {{in the general election}} and Democrats also captured the governorship that year; both were harbingers of the demise of the Whig Party in Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|LMP2 {{consisted}} of ten cars with 30 drivers. With Tandy driving for Porsche, KCMG employed Toyota's test and reserve driver Nicolas Lapierre <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>his</b> {{position for the}} Spa-Francorchamps race and the 24 Hours of Le Mans. GP2 Series driver Mitch Evans made his first appearance in sports car racing alongside European Le Mans Series competitor Simon Dolan, and Nissan factory driver Harry Tincknell for Jota Sport. Despite a failed buyout of the team by Kairos, a data encryption company, Team SARD Morand confirmed {{their commitment to the}} World Endurance Championship and opted to bring one car which was driven by Oliver Webb, Pierre Ragues and Zoël Amberg. Johannes van Overbeek returned to co-drive for Extreme Speed Motorsports after missing the season's opening round because of a rib injury.|$|E
5|$|Only {{weeks after}} the Darlington affair, the South Carolina Supreme Court {{declared}} the act creating the dispensary system {{in violation of the}} state constitution {{on the grounds that the}} government had no right to run a profit-making business. The vote was 2–1, with Justice Samuel McGowan in the majority. McGowan was a lame duck in office; Lieutenant Governor Gary had been elected <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>his</b> seat effective August 1, 1894. Tillman closed the dispensaries temporarily, resulting in prohibition in South Carolina, and fired the constables. He had taken the precaution, once the court agreed to take the dispensary case, of having the 1893 legislature pass a revised dispensary law. When Gary took the bench, the Tillmanites would have a majority on the state Supreme Court, and Tillman instructed trial justices not to hear challenges to the 1893 law until after August 1. Tillman kept the law suspended until then, afterwards reopening the dispensaries under that statute. The high court declared the 1893 act constitutional on October 8, 1894, 2–1, with Gary voting in the majority.|$|E

5|$|Upon the {{retirement}} of Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. in 1987, President Ronald Reagan considered appointing Senator Orrin Hatch <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>his</b> seat. But Congress had, during the term which he was still serving, enacted a salary increase for the judiciary. In July 1987, Bork was nominated instead, {{although it is not}} clear how important a role the Ineligibility Clause issue played in the selection. Two months later, Assistant Attorney General Charles J. Cooper rejected the Saxbe fix in a written opinion, concluding that it did not resolve the Ineligibility Clause issue. (The Bork nomination was rejected by the Senate, and the seat ultimately went to Anthony Kennedy.) According to Jan Crawford Greenberg, the Justice Department had previously done the same to Senator Hatch the year prior when Hatch put forth his name as a replacement for retiring Chief Justice Warren Burger. According to Greenburg, Michael Carvin used the Ineligibility Clause as a pretext to allow the White House to quietly say no to Hatch.|$|E

25|$|Thomas' {{death was}} a serious blow to Andrew Carnegie's {{financial}} interests. Thomas had run most of Andrew's enterprises, and <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>his</b> role Andrew Carnegie turned to Henry Clay Frick as his replacement.
