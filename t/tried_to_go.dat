5|$|Darcus Allen, {{a convicted}} murderer who {{previously}} served in an Arkansas prison with Clemmons, was allegedly {{present for the}} conversation. Also on Thanksgiving, Clemmons cut off a GPS monitor which Jail Sucks Bail Bonds had secured onto his ankle. On November 28, Clemmons showed two handguns to friends Eddie and Douglas Davis and told them he planned to shoot police officers with them; the exchange was witnessed by Clemmons' half-brother Rickey Hinton, with whom he shared a house. During the exchange, Clemmons danced around with the guns in his hands, claiming to be Lucifer. He told the men he had twice <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to a Tacoma police station, where he planned to walk in and start shooting. The first time the station was closed, and {{the second time he}} got a flat tire on the way there, Clemmons claimed. He talked about stopping at a crowded intersection or a school and shooting people there.|$|E
5|$|On June 30, 1959, Musial was {{the batter}} {{in one of}} the oddest plays in {{baseball}} history. In a game between the Cardinals and Chicago Cubs, he was at the plate with a count of 3–1. Bob Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading catcher Sammy Taylor and rolling {{all the way to the}} backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called ball four, even as Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial had foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play and Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial kept running in attempt to make second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Tony Taylor. Anderson's throw flew over Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial did not see Dark's throw and only noticed Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head, so he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out.|$|E

25|$|Nothing {{improved}} {{when the}} government then <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into reverse with contractionary macroeconomic policies and renewed depreciation. Output plunged, but inflation once more went up instead of down, to 163 percent by 1985. By this time, pessimism about the government's capacity to solve anything, inflationary expectations turning into understandable convictions, and the price-increasing effect of devaluation all combined to give Peru a seemingly unstoppable inflation despite the elimination of anything that might be considered excess demand. The government apparently lost its sense of direction, retreated from its attempt to reopen the economy by returning to higher tariff levels, and otherwise did little except wait for its own end in 1985.|$|E

25|$|On 22 January 1972, a {{week before}} Bloody Sunday, an anti-{{internment}} march was held at Magilligan strand, near Derry. The protesters marched to a new internment camp there, but were stopped by soldiers of the Parachute Regiment. When some protesters threw stones and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> around the barbed wire, paratroopers drove them back by firing rubber bullets at close range and making baton charges. The paratroopers badly beat a number of protesters {{and had to be}} physically restrained by their own officers. These allegations of brutality by paratroopers were reported widely on television and in the press. Some in the Army also thought there had been undue violence by the paratroopers.|$|E
25|$|Miami {{continued}} to whittle away the Bills {{lead in the}} third quarter with an 8-play, 62-yard scoring drive, featuring a 17-yard run by Sammie Smith on third and 2. Stoyanovich finished the drive with a 22-yard field goal that cut their deficit down to one score, 27-20. Buffalo responded with a drive to the Dolphins 27, but this time their defense was up to the task and Kelly was intercepted by safety Jarvis Williams on the 2. However, Miami could not pick up a first down pinned deep in their own territory. Marino <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> deep on third down, but Bills safety Mark Kelso picked him off at the Dolphins 48, leading to a 28-yard Norwood field goal that gave the Bills a 30-20 lead.|$|E

25|$|President Aquino envisioned agrarian {{and land}} reform as the {{centerpiece}} of her administration's social legislative agenda. However, her family background and social class as a privileged daughter of a wealthy and landed clan became a lightning rod of criticisms against her land reform agenda. On February 22, 1987, three weeks after the resounding ratification of the 1987 Constitution, agrarian workers and farmers marched to the historic Mendiola Street near the Malacañan Palace to demand genuine land reform from Aquino's administration. However, the march turned violent when Marine forces fired at farmers who <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> beyond the designated demarcation line set by the police. As a result, at least 12 were killed and 51 protesters were injured in this incident now known as the Mendiola Massacre. This incident led some prominent members of the Aquino Cabinet to resign their government posts.|$|E
25|$|On 27 May, Joseph sent Clausel {{an order}} asking {{for him to}} return the {{divisions}} of Barbot, Foy and Taupin, if he was finished using them. At this time it might take eight to ten days to get a courier through to Clausel's 15,000-man column. On 15 June, Clausel marched from Pamplona, heading for Logroño, hoping to join Joseph. From Logroño he turned northwest and reached Treviño on 22 June, completely unaware of the Battle of Vitoria the day before. At last, Clausel heard about the French defeat and his column marched south to Viana on 23 June. The next day he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> north to Salvatierra but turned around when he received reports {{of the magnitude of}} the Vitoria disaster. On 25 June Clausel picked up the garrison of Logroño and marched northeast toward Pamplona. But reports that the British were trying to intercept his column caused him to swerve south and cross the Ebro River at Lodosa on 26 June.|$|E
25|$|In April 1599 the Spanish army {{stationed}} in Gelderland which {{was led by}} Francesco de Mendoza, the Admiral of Aragon was ordered by the Archduke of Austria to mount an offensive into the Bommelerwaard. Once this has been taken the Spanish would {{then be able to}} cut Holland off. On April 17 the Archduke left a section of troops to cover the Rhine and two days later Mendoza's force marched to Schenkenschans with 12,000 infantry and cavalry along with a siege train. Mendoza <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through to Zaltbommel by taking Schenkenschanz on April 28, but the English garrison there were able to repel the Spanish with heavy loss and were subsequently relieved. At the same time the main bulk of the Anglo-Dutch army under Maurice marched from the Overijssel to counter the Spanish moves. Maurice's force numbered 10,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry with numerous artillery and a large supply train. They arrived in quick time since the army was transported mostly by boat, via the in land waters and the sea.|$|E

25|$|From his {{writings}} and {{the testimony of}} all who knew him, Ryelandt appears first and foremost as {{a man with a}} great sense of duty. Duty towards God above all: he was a deeply religious man, who <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to mass every day, who was knowledgeable about his religion, and who conceived of his music making as a religious duty. Duty towards his music: he was privileged in being able to devote himself exclusively to music, but he was highly conscious this was a privilege and worked very hard, both as a student of Tinel (who drove him hard) and as a composer. Towards his family: he was always extremely solicitous of his wife, but especially during her illness, when he would organize serenades for her as she could no longer attend concerts; he made time for his children, considering their education extremely important, and encouraging them; and he was “Bon-Papa Musique” for his grandchildren, for whom he played his Scènes Enfantines. Towards his students, whose work he corrected with respect instead of denigrating it, and who greatly appreciated his teaching qualities: “Even though he followed the classical method of teaching harmony and counterpoint …, you never had the impression that you were learning something boring,” wrote one of them.|$|E
25|$|This event {{consolidated}} {{the pact}} between Maurice and Zenebishi, which was further confirmed by another marriage alliance between Maurice's daughter and Zenebishi's son Simon. The two Albanian lords {{were willing to}} negotiate with Tocco, but the latter, buoyed by his success, launched raids against both their territories. As a result, Maurice and Zenebishi sent appeals to their clansmen, and a large Albanian army met and almost annihilated the Tocco army at a battle fought at Kranea {{in the district of}} Mesopotamon, in spring or summer 1412. The victorious Albanians marched to the walls of Ioannina, but were again unable to take the city. In late 1412 or early 1413, Carlo Tocco was forced to turn to the Turks for support, arranging for the marriage of one of his natural daughters with Musa Çelebi, one of the Ottoman princes contending for the sultanate during the Ottoman Interregnum. The alliance eased Tocco's position, but Musa was defeated and killed later in the year by his brother, Mehmed I. At the same time, Maurice concluded an alliance to Tocco's Italian rival in the Morea, the Prince of Achaea Centurione II Zaccaria. Maurice's half-brother Charles, who had been appointed governor of Rhiniasa, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> over to Tocco, but was apprehended by the local magnates and handed over to Maurice. A scandal involving Zenebishi's son and a son-in-law of Maurice led to a quarrel between the two Albanian rulers and the collapse of their alliance. Tocco moved quickly to win over Zenebishi and conclude peace with him. Maurice died in 1414 or 1415, and was succeeded by his full brother, Yaqub Spata, in Arta, while Charles Marchesano was given the governorship of Rogoi. Maurice's successors proved unable to withstand Tocco's assaults, however, and in October 1416, Yaqub was captured and killed in an ambush. Arta surrendered, ending the era of Albanian rule in the area.|$|E
