He focused his early {{work on the}} Bermudian genus Poecilozonites, while his later work concentrated on the West Indian genus Cerion. According to Gould [...] "Cerion is the land snail of maximal diversity in form throughout the entire world. There are 600 described species of this single genus. In fact, they're not really species, they all interbreed, but the names exist to express a real phenomenon which is this incredible morphological diversity. Some are shaped like golf balls, some are shaped like pencils. ... Now my main subject is the evolution of form, {{and the problem of}} how it is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> this diversity amid so little genetic difference, so far as we can tell, is a very interesting one. And if we could solve this we'd learn something general about the evolution of form." ...|$|E

Christian Donlan of Eurogamer stated that Perfect Dark is [...] "not afraid to throw dead ends at you seemingly {{for the hell of}} it, or repeat textures so much in its huge maps <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> a little dizzy." [...] GameSpot's Tom Mc Shea noted that the campaign was [...] "oddly paced", and that [...] "locked doors, unused rooms, and dead ends... can be disheartening to stumble around in a circle until you finally happen upon the correct door you just couldn't locate." [...] Nevertheless, he admitted that [...] "it's {{a lot of fun to}} replay them to try for high scores and figure out the many unique objectives." [...] He also remarked that that online play can periodically suffer from a significant amount of lag, but praised the amount of content and features.|$|E
500|$|Rihanna {{shot the}} music video for [...] "What Now" [...] inside a {{warehouse}} in Phuket, Thailand on September 17, 2013, during a tour stop of the Diamonds World Tour. It {{was directed by}} Jeff Nicholas, Jonathan Craven, and Darren Craig from Uprising Creativity. Nicholas and Craven previously worked on the video for Justin Timberlake's single [...] "Tunnel Vision" [...] from his third studio album The 20/20 Experience. According to Steven Gottlieb of VideoStatic the double-exposure body shots are a visible common similarity of the two videos. On November 13, Rihanna unveiled a behind-the-scenes video via her official Vevo account. During it she explained {{the concept of the}} video, [...] "It's gonna be kind of eerie, very creepy because 'What Now' is one of those songs <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> really boring with the visual. You can get really almost expected. Everybody's probably expecting narrative type of video, a love story of some sorts or something really soft and pretty" [...] and then says, [...] "It is pretty and kind of soft, but it's really a little demented." [...] Prior to the video's release, Rihanna posted a sneak peek of the video on YouTube. The official music video was released to VEVO on November 15, 2013.|$|E

500|$|Spence D. of IGN said, [...] "If Britney Spears' Greatest Hits: My Prerogative {{illuminates}} anything it's that Spears is {{a fairly}} proficient sonic chameleon, able to mimic and adopt the stylings {{of those who have}} come before her with enough panache and verve to convince younger generations that she's a bona fide pop revelation. [...] This is the kind of kitschy album <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> away with having because Spears is such a prevalent component of pop culture." [...] James Gashinski of The Gazette said that [...] "As a time capsule, My Prerogative does its job well," [...] but [...] "Added together, the pop hits on this album are somewhat less than the sum of their parts". He explained, [...] "Even if it isn't as great a listen as a cohesive album, My Prerogative does work as a portrait of the time when Britney Spears was the defining figure of American pop culture". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic agreed with Gashinski, but added [...] "if you compare it to The Immaculate Collection, which captured the time when Madonna was the defining figure of American pop culture and does work as an album, it's clear that a cultural artifact isn't necessarily the same thing as great music".|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "Sun of a Gun", {{directed}} by ThirtyTwo, was first released onto Vevo on 19 October 2010. It was filmed in 2010 in Brooklyn, and displays Oh Land {{in two different}} themes: dark and light. According to Oh Land herself, she [...] "wanted the video to show the two different states <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> in {{when you are in}} love with someone". The dark side reflects her [...] "desire to protect oneself from being hurt and celebrating independence", while the light side reflects her [...] "desire to be loved and the joys of being in love". The video opens with the dark side of Oh Land, wearing a black dress and extensive eye makeup. She performs the song's choreography atop a cloud-like stage, surrounded by blinking lights. As the track's chorus begins, the light side of Oh Land appears, in a skin-colored dress and longer hair, in front of a screen displaying the sun. The second verse finds her wearing a different black dress, and singing the song by many mirrors; simultaneously, visuals of Oh Land on the ground dancing appear. The following chorus shows the same scenario, but in the same skin-colored dress from earlier. In the song's bridge, both versions of the singer pull a shawl over their head, allowing it to move with the wind. The video concludes with Oh Land closing her eyes as the screen cuts to black.|$|E

The laboratory found that the card contained only a standard radio frequency security tag of the type used in stores to prevent shoplifting. According to the laboratory's Dr. Markus Kuhn, it was [...] "impossible" [...] for the card to detect anything and it had [...] "absolutely {{nothing to do with}} the detection of TNT". The card could not be programmed, had no memory, no microprocessor and no form of information could be stored on it. Despite the high cost of the devices, the cards were worth only about two to three pence (3–5¢) each. Kuhn commented: [...] "These are the cheapest bit of electronics <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> that look vaguely electronic and are sufficiently flat to fit inside a card." [...] The [...] "card reader" [...] was found to be an empty plastic box.

2500|$|Vol. 2 was {{the first}} film to be shot with an 8K {{resolution}} camera, the Red Weapon 8K. Gunn had wanted to use a different camera than the Alexa 65 {{that had been used}} for several other Marvel films, because he found it to be a [...] "very big and heavy camera". He wanted a camera that could deliver equivalent image quality to the Alexa 65, and tested multiple options. He eventually met with Red, whom he had a positive experience with working on The Legend of Tarzan, and they introduced him to an early prototype for the Weapon 8K. He, Gunn, and Marvel decided to use the camera in September 2015, when only that single prototype existed, and spent months working with Red to get the camera ready for filming. For the sequence where Rocket and Yondu escape from the Ravagers, a Phantom Camera was used to film scenes up to 2000 frames per second, with the footage able to be moved from slow-motion to high-speed within a single shot. Each shot using the camera had to be carefully set up and choreographed. Additional scenes were also shot in IMAX and its aspect ratio. Braham filmed almost 85 percent of the film using a stabilizing technology he had contributed to called Stabileye, which he called [...] "a handheld dolly" [...] which allowed [...] "a spontaneity to the way the camera moves that is different and that felt appropriate for this movie." [...] For filming the cockpits of spaceships, Braham surrounded the practical sets with video panels and other light sources that he could use to create realistic lighting no matter the environment outside the ship. Exteriors of the ships were filmed with the camera on a technocrane, but any shots inside the cockpits again used the Stabileye which is [...] "so small <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> it in there next to the actors".|$|E

And then he came up with a line he really liked and he jumped out of his seat and he said, 'Uh oh! Get out of that seat, Hov.' And I just thought it was so funny. It made me laugh. I was standing right beside him when he did it and so I just put it on the record, more or less as a joke to him." [...] Timberlake added that the song harkens back to the glory years of the Rat Pack. [...] "Not to compare ourselves to those guys, but just the fun that they had," [...] he said. [...] "I was picturing like, being at the Sands in Vegas and saying, 'Oh, JAY-Z's in the house tonight. Uh, let's have him come up and do a number.
