5|$|Various {{bird species}} have been {{observed}} {{in the vicinity of}} Harveys Lake. These include surf scoters and black scoters, which have been observed there in the winter. Although greater scaups are rare in Pennsylvania away from Lake Erie, one was observed at <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>in</b> July 1992. Franklin's gulls have also been observed near the lake, as have snow buntings and black-legged kittiwakes, and ruddy ducks. Nine brant geese were observed on <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>in</b> May 1997.|$|E
5|$|M-22 is an {{original}} trunkline, {{dating to the}} July 1, 1919 designation of the system. In 1929, the highway was rerouted along {{the west side of}} Little Glen Lake, using the modern M-109 around the lake. M-22 would be rerouted back around to the present routing the next year, and M-109 was designated {{on the west side of}} <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>in</b> its place.|$|E

5|$|Some anomalously old {{radiocarbon}} {{dates of}} Lake Cahuilla deposits {{may be the}} consequence of the Colorado River transporting ancient carbonates into <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> <b>In</b> addition, discrepancies between shell and other organic material ages can reach 400–800 years owing to old carbon; shells can also absorb carbon-14 from the air. Other research has documented no substantial old carbon effects.|$|E
5|$|A lake {{restoration}} plan {{based on a}} decentralised bioreactor system to eliminate the organic load that enters <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>in</b> the form of non-point and point source pollutants has also been mooted. Phumdis could be harvested in a sustainable manner by conversion into fuel and compost by installing ‘Plug Flow Bioreactors’ in a modular manner around the lake perimeter. Laboratory tests of key species of phumdis have proved its potential to produce biogas. The bioreactors {{could also be used}} to treat sewage and thus arrest flow of organic matter into the lake.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} , the route passes by open fields as it overlooks {{the lake to}} the east. The route {{gradually}} descends back into the valley as it heads further northward into the town of Fleming. Once in Fleming, NY38 runs along the lakeshore and serves {{a long line of}} lakeside homes as it passes by a series of fields to the west. The amount of development along the route begins to increase at the northern end of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>in</b> the hamlet of Melrose Park, where NY38 meets NY437 by way of a traffic circle. At this point, NY437 becomes the primary lakeside highway while NY38 becomes a four-lane divided highway and heads northwest as Lake Avenue toward the city of Auburn.|$|E

5|$|Harveys Lake {{has been}} the subject of {{scientific}} studies since the late 1940s, when C. B. Reif conducted limnological studies on it. By the 1960s, Harveys Lake began to develop environmental problems. It was the subject of a number of studies in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These studies indicated that the lake was eutrophic. Algae blooms caused it to be closed to swimming in 1981 and 1990. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection completed a phosphorus TMDL for <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>in</b> 2002.|$|E
5|$|Harveys Lake {{is named}} after Benjamin Harvey, {{a member of the}} Sons of Liberty and among the first {{settlers}} of the Wyoming Valley. Harvey inadvertently discovered <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>in</b> 1781, while returning home after being held as a prisoner of war in Fort Niagara. The first resident {{in the vicinity of the}} lake was Matthew Scouten, who arrived in the early 1790s, but the first settlers were the Worthingtons, who arrived in 1806. The lake was first surveyed by Christopher Hurlbert in 1794, and the first person of European descent to explore the lake by canoe was Andrew Bennett, in 1800.|$|E
5|$|Harveys Lake was accidentally {{discovered}} by Benjamin Harvey in 1781. The first settlers arrived at <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>in</b> the 1790s and 1800s. Early {{industries in the}} area included lumbering and farming, but it became well known as a summer resort {{in the latter part}} of the 1800s and into the 1900s. It was also used as a water supply in the early 1900s. However, the lake began to develop significant environmental problems in the 1960s and a total maximum daily load was created for it in 1994. Since 1968, the lake has been located in the borough of Harveys Lake.|$|E

Tundra swans are absent in summer as they migrate to the arctic and subarctic to nest, however, the non-native, Eurasian mute swans compete for habitat with the non-migrating trumpeter swan population and is an impediment to restoration of the native trumpeters around the Great Lakes. Additional native birds hosted by the lake include cardinals, blue jays, finches, orioles, woodpeckers, teal, mallards, resident and migratory Canada geese, and an occasional bald eagle.|$|E
5|$|Ramirez's {{portrayal}} of the original Lady of <b>the</b> <b>Lake</b> <b>in</b> the 2005 Broadway musical Spamalot, won her acclaim and the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical. She gained wider recognition {{for her role as}} Dr. Callie Torres, in ABC's long-running medical drama Grey's Anatomy. The character's popularity soared as the series progressed, and Ramirez garnered multiple nominations for Best Actress at the ALMA Awards, and a Favorite Dramatic TV Actress nomination at the People's Choice Awards. She made her debut as a voice artist with the 1999 video game entitled UmJammer Lammy, and has voiced Queen Miranda in the animated series Sofia the First (2012–present).|$|E
5|$|Salinity {{differences}} between the sections of the lake separated by the railroad causeway result in significantly different biota. A phytoplankton community dominated by green algae or cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) tint the water south of the causeway a greenish color. North of the causeway, the lake is dominated by Dunaliella salina, a species of algae which releases beta-carotene, and the bacteria-like haloarchaea, which together give the water an unusual reddish or purplish color, and the bacteria converts non-toxic mercury into toxic methyl mercury, which then flows into the Southern portion of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>in</b> a heavy brine layer through the causeway.|$|E

5|$|The Algodones Dunes {{were formed}} from sand {{deposited}} by Lake Cahuilla, which was transported by wind toward the area. During its existence, the lake supported a rich biota with fish, bivalves and vegetation on its shorelines. These resources supported human populations on its shores, {{as evidenced by}} a number of archeological sites and mythological references to <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>in</b> the traditions of the Cahuilla. The lake may have had profound effects on population genetics and language history of the surrounding regions.|$|E

5|$|Toxic {{blue-green algae}} blooms are a {{reasonably}} common occurrence in the lake. Warnings about coming {{into contact with}} the water are released when an algal bloom is detected. Attempts are being made to limit the amount of phosphates entering <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>in</b> the hope of improving its water quality. Blue-green algae (more correctly cyanobacteria) produce toxins, which can be harmful for humans and any other animals that come in contact with the contaminated water. There have been several cases of dogs being affected after playing in and drinking the lake water.|$|E
5|$|Harveys Lake {{has been}} popular for {{recreational}} purposes {{since the late}} 1800s. Places such as Warden Place and Sandy Beach were popular recreational areas near <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>in</b> the early 1900s. Around this time period, there were four steamboats on Harveys Lake. They were used for carrying passengers and freight. Recreational steamboat rides on the lake were popular between 1900 and 1920. A 60-foot (18-meter) high Shoot the Chute {{was built in the}} area by Charles Shelley in 1910. It was one of the largest attractions in the lake's vicinity. A casino near the lake was opened by Frank Devlin in May 1924, but was demolished in 1980. Devlin also opened the largest bowling alley in northeast Pennsylvania near the lake. Throughout the 20th century, prior to and after World War II, the lake attracted thousands of visitors yearly.|$|E
