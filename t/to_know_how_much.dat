5|$|Never before have I {{written to}} {{a player to}} express my regret at his {{omission}} from the Australian XI. In your case I am making an exception because I want you <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> my colleagues and I disliked having to make this move. Captain one match {{and out of the}} side the next looks like ingratitude, but you understand the circumstances and {{will be the first to}} admit that your form has not been good.|$|E
25|$|To {{know whether}} it is ethical {{to turn off the}} {{respirator}} for a quadriplegic patient requires conceptions of personal identity, a worthy human life, murder and suicide; <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> information a doctor must provide a cancer patient to obtain proper informed consent for an experimental therapy requires conceptions of autonomy, coercion and the public good and how to balance these values; to know whether to break the AIDS patient’s confidentiality and inform his wife requires a framework for weighing the relative importance of competing individual rights as well as the public good.|$|E
25|$|The defense {{tried to}} get {{surviving}} members of the crew to admit they were in Kentucky only to photograph poor people, asking if they intended to photograph more prosperous parts of the state. The defense also wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> money they had been paid from the filming. Ison's lawyer used his closing statement to speak more about the intrusiveness of reporters than his client's actions. Nevertheless, the only legal issue was Ison's sanity. A psychiatrist testifying for the defense identified Ison as a paranoid schizophrenic, but a prosecution psychiatrist contradicted this.|$|E

25|$|It is {{frequently}} important <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> {{of a particular}} resource (such as time or storage) is theoretically required for a given algorithm. Methods {{have been developed for}} the analysis of algorithms to obtain such quantitative answers (estimates); for example, the sorting algorithm above has a time requirement of O(n), using the big O notation with n as the length of the list. At all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values: the largest number found so far, and its current position in the input list. Therefore, it is said to have a space requirement of O(1), if the space required to store the input numbers is not counted, or O(n) if it is counted.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{problems}} associated with water-logged and wet soils, it is important for viticulturist <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> water is currently in the soil before deciding if and how much to irrigate. There are several methods of evaluating soil moisture. The most basic is simple observation and feeling of the soil, however this has its limitations since the subsoil may be moist while the surface soil appears dry. More specific measurements can be attained by using tensiometers which evaluates surface tension of water extracted from the soil. The presence of water in the soil can be measured by neutron moisture meters that utilize an aluminium tube with an internal neutron source that detect the subtle change between the water in the soil. Similarly, gypsum block placed throughout the vineyard contain an electrode {{that can be used to}} detect the electrical resistance that occurs as the soil dries and water is released by evaporation. Since the 1990s there has been greater research into tools utilizing time-domain reflectometry and capacitance probes. In addition to monitoring for excessive moisture, viticulturists also keep an eye for signs of water stress (discussed below) due to severe lack of water.|$|E

The song is a bolero-pop ballad with ranchera influences and portrays the singer yearning for his lover <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> she means to him. A music video was made for the track and {{was used as the}} main theme for the Mexican telenovela María Isabel.|$|E
500|$|Hay was {{disgusted by}} Bryan's speeches, writing in {{language}} that Taliaferro compares to The Bread-Winners that the Democrat [...] "simply reiterates the unquestioned truths that every {{man with a}} clean shirt is a thief {{and ought to be}} hanged: that there is no goodness and wisdom except among the illiterate & criminal classes". Despite Bryan's strenuous efforts, McKinley won the election easily, with a campaign run by himself and Hanna, and well-financed by supporters like Hay. Henry Adams later wondered, [...] "I would give sixpence <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> Hay paid for McKinley. His politics must have cost." ...|$|E
500|$|Aubrey {{received}} {{a salary of}} $4,000 a week, but had no contract. He said in 1986, [...] "I wanted Kirk {{to be able to}} say, 'Get lost, Jim,' without obligation if it didn't work." [...] Like most of the big studios in the 1960s, MGM was struggling and Kerkorian said his new president would bring the company roaring back to its former glory. Instead, Aubrey largely liquidated the company as Kerkorian transformed it into a hospitality company with the MGM Grand Hotel he was building. [...] "We've been using old-fashioned methods here," [...] Aubrey said at the time. In 1986, he said the company was [...] "total disarray. Until you were in a position to lift up the rug, there was no way <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> disarray. The crown jewel of studios had become a shambles." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} was negatively received by Ruth Deller of television website Lowculture and Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail. In May 2009, Deller placed Charlie at number five on her list of worst soap opera characters segment. Deller said, [...] "The Summer Bay cop may {{have lots of}} storylines, but the LC community don't really approve – mainly due to Esther Anderson's apparent lack of acting chops. It's like our hatred for Michelle Connor (Coronation Street) all over again, only this time with added scandalous-headline-grabbing-faux-lesbianity!" [...] In July 2009, Deller said, [...] "It {{would be easy to}} spend every month slagging off Charlie, because there's so much to dislike". Deller also added that Charlie's daughter is [...] "everything Charlie isn't". Stephen wondered if Charlie is going through an early menopause as she always appears [...] "to be in a sweat onscreen." [...] During a storyline, which saw Charlie decide she needs a counsellor to find her self-identity, Stephen complained that it was all she seemed to mention since her [...] "foray into lesbianism." [...] Stephen did, however, agree that Charlie needed a counsellor. She also stated she could help by telling her; [...] "Charlie: you're a mess." [...] Stephen was critical of Charlie's relationship with Angelo, which she described as a [...] "rocky road". She wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the show could [...] "wring out of their on/off romance" [...] and asked if somebody could send them out to sea in a sinking boat. Following Charlie and Angelo's 2011 break up, Stephen stated that the show needs to [...] "change the record!" ...|$|E

50|$|Elizabeth Keckley {{continued}} {{to attempt to}} earn money by sewing and teaching young women her techniques, and much of her white clientele stopped calling. Eventually, she was in great need of money. In 1890, at 72, she made a drastic decision: to sell the Lincoln articles, which she kept for thirty-five years. She sold twenty-six articles for $250, but it remains <b>to</b> be <b>known</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> she received from the transactions.|$|R
2500|$|The couple {{continued}} to live separately after the civil marriage. In October 1956, Davidman was walking across her kitchen when she tripped over the telephone wire {{and fell to the}} floor, thereby breaking her left upper leg. At the Churchill Hospital, Oxford, she was diagnosed with incurable cancer, with bone metastases from breast carcinoma. It was at this time that Lewis recognized that he {{had fallen in love with}} her, realizing how despondent he would feel to lose her. He wrote to a friend: [...] "new beauty and new tragedy have entered my life. You would be surprised (or perhaps you would not?) <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of a strange sort of happiness and even gaiety there is between us." [...] Davidman underwent several operations and radiation treatment for the cancer. In March 1957, Warren Lewis wrote in his diary: [...] "One of the most painful days of my life. Sentence of death has been passed on Joy, and the end is only a matter of time." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Australia's biggest {{defeat at}} home in 50 years the Australian press were in uproar and the {{selectors}} Ewart Macmillan, Jack Ryder and Don Bradman took drastic action, dropping the captain Brian Booth, batsman Bob Cowper and the bowlers Garth McKenzie, Peter Philpott and David Sincock. Booth {{received a letter from}} Bradman on behalf of the selectors explaining [...] "Never before have I written to a player to express my regret at his omission from the Australian XI. In your case I am making an exception because I want you <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> my colleagues and I disliked having to make this move.

[...] Booth had made only 84 runs (16.80) in the series and never played for Australia again. Cowper was blamed for slow scoring even though he had made 99 and 60 in the Second and Third Tests. Peter Allan of Queensland was brought back into the side after he had taken the third best bowling figures in Australia – 10/61 in the first innings against Victoria, but was injured and McKenzie was restored to the team. The off-spinner Tom Veivers and young batsmen Ian Chappell were called up and Keith Stackpole made his Test debut, so Australia went to Adelaide with only three specialist bowlers – McKenzie, Hawke and Veivers. England simply kept the same XI from Sydney, even though this meant that Geoff Boycott was their third place bowler after Jeff Jones and Dave Brown. Mike Smith won the toss and decided to bat.|$|E
