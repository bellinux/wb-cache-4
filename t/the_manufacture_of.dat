5|$|Only about 6% of {{the salt}} {{manufactured}} {{in the world is}} used in food. Of the remainder, 12% is used in water conditioning processes, 8% goes for de-icing highways and 6% is used in agriculture. The rest (68%) is used for manufacturing and other industrial processes, and sodium chloride {{is one of the largest}} inorganic raw materials used by volume. Its major chemical products are caustic soda and chlorine, which are separated by the electrolysis of a pure brine solution. These are used in <b>the</b> <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> PVC, plastics, paper pulp and many other inorganic and organic compounds. Salt is also used as a flux in the production of aluminium. For this purpose, a layer of melted salt floats on top of the molten metal and removes iron and other metal contaminants. It is also used in <b>the</b> <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> soaps and glycerine, where it is added to the vat to precipitate out the saponified products. As an emulsifier, salt is used in <b>the</b> <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> synthetic rubber, and another use is in the firing of pottery, when salt added to the furnace vaporises before condensing onto the surface of the ceramic material, forming a strong glaze.|$|E
