5|$|Continuing <b>the</b> <b>stylistic</b> {{blueprint}} of Debut, Post {{is considered}} an important exponent of art pop and {{is known for its}} eclecticism, mainly incorporating electronic and dance styles—such as techno, trip hop, IDM and house—but also ambient, jazz, industrial and experimental music. A reflection of Björk's new life in London, Post features songs she wrote after moving to England and was intended to convey the fast pace and urban culture of the city, deviating from the themes of its predecessor, which focused on the compositions the singer had written in Iceland. It also centres on the contemporary styles of British underground club culture, with which the singer had established close ties.|$|E
5|$|The main hall in each {{of these}} {{underground}} tombs leads to two four-sided brick-laden burial chambers connected by a short corridor; these chambers feature domed ceilings. The tomb of Li Xian features real fully stone doors, a tomb trend apparent in the Han and Western Jin dynasties that became more common {{by the time of the}} Northern Qi dynasty. <b>The</b> <b>stylistic</b> stone door of Lou Rui's tomb of 570 closely resembles that of Tang stone doors, such as the one in Li Xian's tomb.|$|E
5|$|The modern Regent Street is {{the result}} of this redevelopment. No {{original}} structures survive except south of Oxford Circus for some Nash-designed sewers. The current design {{is an example of the}} Beaux Arts approach to urban design: an assembly of separate buildings on a grand scale, designed to harmonise and produce an impressive overall effect. Strict rules governed the reconstruction. Each block had to be designed with a continuous unifying street façade and finished in Portland stone. The first redevelopment was Regent House, just south of Oxford Circus. <b>The</b> <b>stylistic</b> tone for the rebuilding was set by Sir Reginald Blomfield's Quadrant.|$|E

5|$|Work on the {{new house}} began in 1685. The {{architect}} {{thought to have been}} responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, {{that it could have been}} the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on <b>the</b> <b>stylistic</b> similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>stylistic</b> {{innovations}} Radama adopted for {{the construction}} of several of the compound's buildings, the Rova largely retained its traditional features during his reign. The basic layout of the compound remained largely unaltered from its original design with the sole exception of an expansion of the Rova along its north-south axis. Stone walls topped with sharpened wooden stakes were built around the new perimeter during this period. Venerable buildings such as Besakana, Nanjakana, Mahitsy and Manjakamiadana were retained, as were the houses of several of Andrianampoinimerina's wives, many of whom were still living at the time of Radama's death in 1828. During his reign, Radama undertook the restoration of Marivolanitra to serve chiefly as housing for visiting foreigners, and briefly inhabited it himself in addition to his main residence at Besakana. He also had a house called Kelisoa ("Petite Beauty") built as a lodging for his concubines.|$|E
5|$|Scholar William Luis observes {{a strong}} {{resemblance}} between {{the structure of}} Julia Alvarez’s How the García Girls Lost Their Accents and Alejo Carpentier's Viaje a la Semilla as both employ the tactic of backwards narration and consequently lay claim to two beginnings and two endings. Alvarez has also been said to follow <b>the</b> <b>stylistic</b> traditions established by novels such as Pedro Juan Labarthe's The Son of Two Nations: The Private Life of a Columbia Student (1931), Marcio Veloz Maggiolo's El prófugo (1962), Humberto Cintrón's Frankie Cristo (1972), and Richard Ruiz's The Hungry American (1978). Despite the overtly North American stylistic qualities the book appears to boast at first glance, each of the aforementioned authors are of Hispanic descent.|$|E

5|$|That month, Lovato also {{announced}} her departure from Sonny with a Chance, putting her acting career on hiatus and ending the series; she later {{said that she}} would return to acting when she felt confident doing so. Her departure led to the spin-off series So Random! with the Sonny cast, featuring sketches from the former show-within-a-show. The series was cancelled after one season. Lovato released her third album, Unbroken, on September 20, 2011. Begun in July 2010, the album experimented with R and featured less pop rock. The album and <b>the</b> <b>stylistic</b> change received mixed reviews from critics, who saw a growth in musicianship because of her struggles and have praised Lovato's vocals but found the music more generic than her previous efforts. The record was a commercial success, peaking at number four on the Billboard 200, with sales exceeding 97,000 copies in its first week of release, and going on to sell over 500,000 copies in the United States, being certified Gold.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural {{season of}} Homicide {{established}} a realistic visual style that would remain largely intact throughout {{the duration of}} the series. Among <b>the</b> <b>stylistic</b> elements were the near-constant movement with hand-held Super 16 cameras to give the show a naturalistic documentary look and an editing style involving jump cuts that was unusual for television at the time. Wayne Ewing had used Super 16 cameras while filming promotional material for Toys, and that format allowed Homicide producers to film cheaply and with a smaller crew, giving them more time to focus on the actor's performances. While filming, Levinson said he would simply allow the actors to perform while he switched back and forth between them with the hand-held camera instead of filming carefully planned shots and individual scenes from multiple angles. Levinson said the camera and editing style was partially inspired by the Jean-Luc Godard film Breathless (1960), which he would often ask his directors to watch before filming Homicide episodes.|$|E
5|$|Prone to {{downtime}} due to Keenan's other musical commitments, {{among other}} things, the band has featured {{a variety of}} musicians in the other roles throughout its alternating periods of activity and inactivity. The original incarnation of the band included Paz Lenchantin on bass, Troy Van Leeuwen on guitar, and Josh Freese on drums; though Primus drummer Tim Alexander had briefly stood in as a drummer prior to Freese in the band's initial live shows prior to releasing any material. Band collaborator and producer Danny Lohner and Marilyn Manson bassist Jeordie White were also members {{for a short period}} in the early 2000s. The band's current lineup features former Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha, bassist Matt McJunkins, and drummer Jeff Friedl, the latter two also being contributors to the related Puscifer and Ashes Divide projects. Despite the varied cast and numerous lineup changes, <b>the</b> <b>stylistic</b> content of the songs has remained consistent with Howerdel as music composer, and Keenan penning the lyrics and vocal melodies. The band's studio albums have been generally well received critically and commercially, with their three studio albums selling 4 million copies collectively as of 2005.|$|E

5|$|West made a {{conscious}} decision to abstain from the widespread recording practice of excessive rap albums saturated with skits and filler and instead comprised Graduation with significantly fewer tracks. He also chose to scale back on the guest appearances, limiting himself to just one single guest rap verse on the entire studio album. <b>The</b> <b>stylistic</b> divergence and desire for a leaner, more economical studio album was a creative reaction that was brought on by the alternative rock and indie-rock that West had been listening to {{around the time of the}} recording of his third studio album. West cites the rock bands The Killers, Keane, Modest Mouse, and indie-pop singer-songwriter Feist, whom he also looked towards for songwriting inspiration, for being among his favorite musicians and having considerably profound influence on the sound of Graduation. Largely due to all this and the inclusion of the layered electronic synthesizers, West believed that his record took hip-hop in a different direction. But he also acknowledged the fact that the differences did not right away and without a doubt make Graduation a good album. However, he felt it was a representation of the music he was listening to at that time.|$|E

25|$|Gilbert's two {{buildings}} on the University of Texas at Austin campus, Sutton Hall (1918) and Battle Hall (1911), are widely recognized by architectural historians as among the finest works of architecture in the state.
