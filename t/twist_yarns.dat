50|$|Handspinners use {{the number}} of twists per inch often. Because the amount of twist defines {{a lot about a}} yarn, {{the number of}} twists per inch is an {{important}} measure to recreate a yarn. As a spinner spins, they will often stop every few minutes to check to see that the number of twists per inch is the same throughout the yarn, as well as that the number of wraps per inch (the thickness of the yarn) is the same. Measuring the number of twists per inch while spinning singles also helps the spinner create a balanced yarn when plying. Yarns that have relatively few twists per inch tend to have a softer hand but are not as strong as yarns with more twists per inch, such as medium twist or hard <b>twist</b> <b>yarns.</b> Yarns that have a very hard twist, enough so that the yarn will double back onto itself when released from tension, are called crepe-twist yarns.|$|E

40|$|Dr. Donald King has {{examined}} {{a portion of}} cloth housed in the Victoria & Albert Museum [ref. no. No. 7027 - 1860], and concluded it bore similarities to {{the fabric of the}} Turin Shroud. The age of this sample is reputed to be circa {{the second half of the}} fourteenth century. I found this cloth to be a herringbone or reverse twill fabric, woven from 'Z ' <b>twist</b> <b>yarns</b> and described as linen. It had a design of foliage and birds. An examination of the printed areas, under low power magnification, indicated that the edge of the design, particularly on the warp yarn floats, is not as crisp and clear as is sometimes achieved with textile prints. This, and the fact that the cloth had been dyed, suggested that the material had been printed with a substance that had resisted the dye penetration in those appropriate parts of the design. This means of design production known as the resist (French 'réserve') is referred to by Agnes Geijer 1, and was employed in the mediaeval period in Europe for the production of cheap imitations of the woven designs found in Persian silk cloths. The cloth was found to contain approximately 22 threads per centimetre in the warp, and 12 per cm. weftway. This differed considerably from the Turin Shroud which, according to Prof...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, natural fibre-reinforced polymer {{composites}} {{have been}} attracting {{attention from the}} viewpoint of reducing the impact on the natural environment. Currently, the use of thermoplastic resins in composites is clearly of higher potential than the use of thermoset. There are many thermoplastic polymers derived from renewable raw materials, which are also biodegradable. Polylactic acid (PLA) is one such candidate, and it shows rather good properties that are suitable for applications that do not require long-term durability or elevated mechanical performance at higher temperatures. In order to make their possible use in many technical applications more attractive, the mechanical properties of the PLA can be enhanced by using reinforcements. Hemp fibres can be considered to be a good choice for reinforcing polymer composites, due to their high stiffness, strength, and aspect ratio. Highly ordered textile reinforcements, such as interlaced woven fabrics and unidirectional fabrics made from natural-fibre yarns, perform considerably better than random non-woven mats in natural-fibre composites. At present, the commercially available plant-fibre yarns are not intended for structural composites, but for textiles, which have entirely different demands on the yarns. Thus, work is needed to tailor-make the best plant-fibre yarn for reinforcement of composites. This also includes investigation of the possibility of combining plant-fibre yarns with the matrix polymer in fibre form into one hybrid yarn (a composite preform), and how to do it (twisting or blending). It is well known that fibres provide the highest strength and stiffness when they are continuous and aligned {{in the direction of the}} applied load. Natural fibres are naturally discontinuous and conventional spun staple yarns tend to be highly twisted, which leads to fibre misalignment and poor resin wet-out. The structured natural-fibre composites reported so far are based on twisted yarns produced by long-established conventional spinning methods, mainly ring spinning. In this paper, we report our work on improving the orientation of hemp fibres in composites by using our recent development of co-wrapped yarn structures. This novel co-wrapped yarn consists of low twist and very fine hemp yarns next to PLA filaments in the core part, which are wrapped by PLA filaments. By varying the composition of hybrid yarn, it is possible to vary the hemp fibre content from 10 to 45 wt %. An exciting recent advancement has been a new family of aligned natural-fibre reinforcements, which has overcome these issues by using low <b>twist</b> <b>yarns.</b> We also report the influence of fibre content and wrap density (number of wraps per unit length) on the properties of composites. Before compression moulding, multilayer 0 / 90 bidirectional hybrid yarn prepregs were prepared by winding the hybrid yarn around a steel rectangular frame. We investigated the mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties of hemp-reinforced PLA composites. Compared to neat PLA, the tensile and flexural modulus and the strength of the PLA-hemp composites were significantly higher as a result of the increased fibre content. Impact strength of the composites decreased initially up to 10 wt % fibre loading, but even higher fibre loading caused an improvement in impact strength. From the DMTA results, it is evident that incorporation of the fibres gives a considerable increase in storage modulus and a decrease in tan δ values. These results show the reinforcing effect of hemp on PLA matrix. From the general trend in the results obtained, it can be affirmed that co-wrapped hybrid yarn with lower wrapping density leads to lower mechanical properties in the composite. The study performed with DSC revealed that the glass transition temperature and the crystalline melting point of PLA were not affected significantly after reinforcement with hemp. The crystallisation temperature of the hemp-reinforced PLA composites decreased compared to pure PLA, which indicates that the hemp fibres hinder the migration and diffusion of PLA molecular chains to the surface of the nucleus in the composites. No noteworthy differences in calorimetric data from DSC for composites were observed between the hybrid yarn preforms with different wrapping density. Future work will concentrate on efforts to evaluate the biodegradability of these developing and promising composites...|$|E

40|$|During yarn {{formation}} by ring spinning, fibres {{are bent}} into approximately helical shapes and an unbalanced torque or twist-liveliness is created. Generally, the torque depends on yarn geometric {{factors such as}} the <b>yarn</b> <b>twist</b> and linear density and the fibre properties. In order to prevent the instability of yarn (e. g., snarling), twist-liveliness must be controlled. A practical {{solution to the problem of}} twist-liveliness is the formation of a two-fold <b>yarn.</b> This <b>twisting</b> or plying process produces a yarn structure where the energy of the system is determined by purely geometrical constraints of the plied structure and consequently when an energy minimum is reached the plied yarn obtained from the process is torsionally balanced and torque-free.
