5|$|So {{direction}} 0 indicates <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> {{continues to}} travel straight ahead, direction 1 indicates <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> {{will make a}} right turn of 60° and similarly for the other directions. <b>The</b> <b>worm</b> cannot travel in direction 3 {{because that is the}} gridline it has just traversed. Thus a worm with rule {1,0,5,1} decides to travel in direction 1 the first time it has to make a choice, in direction 0 the next time it has to make a choice and so on. If there is only one available gridline, <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> {{has no choice but to}} take it and this is usually not explicitly listed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>worm</b> {{starts at}} some point of an {{infinite}} triangular grid. It starts moving along {{one of the six}} gridlines that meet at each point and, once it has travelled one unit of distance, it arrives at a new point. <b>The</b> <b>worm</b> then decides, based on the distribution of traversed and untraversed gridlines, what direction it will take. The directions are relative to the worm's point of view. If <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> has not encountered this exact distribution before it may leave along any untraversed gridline. From then on, if it encounters that distribution again, it must move in the same way. If there are no untraversed gridlines available, <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> dies and the simulation ends.|$|E

50|$|The game {{plays like}} a fixed shooter, with the player {{controlling}} a tank firing at large <b>worms.</b> <b>The</b> screen auto scrolls up as <b>the</b> <b>worms</b> and blocks move down.

5|$|Scully is {{eventually}} {{captured by the}} townspeople and <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> is inserted into her body. Eventually, Doggett finds Scully, cuts <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> out of her, and shoots the creature dead. Later, Scully is packing her things in the hospital when Doggett comes in to inform her about {{the trial of the}} cult members; they are offering little defense except that they claim that they are being persecuted for their religious beliefs. Scully muses that they thought <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> was the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. She apologizes to Doggett for going out on the mission alone and promises to never do it again.|$|E
5|$|A worm whose ruleset {{begins with}} 0 {{continues}} {{in a straight line}} forever. This is a trivial case, so it is usually stipulated that <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> must turn when it encounters a point with only uneaten gridlines. Furthermore, to avoid mirror-image symmetrical duplicates, the worm's first turn must be a right hand turn. A worm dies if it returns to its origin a third time, because there are then no untraversed edges available. Only the origin can be lethal to <b>the</b> <b>worm.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{games in}} <b>the</b> <b>Worms</b> series had an almost {{realistic}} look for <b>the</b> <b>worms</b> in <b>the</b> cover, although in gameplay, {{it is hard}} to point out the details due to the limitations of screen resolution.

5|$|At 6.8 to 9.2 (7.7) mm, {{males are}} only about half as long as females. Their maximum width is 34 to 42 (37) μm. The length of the {{esophagus}} is 2.3 to 3.0 (2.6) mm, of which the muscular pharynx makes up 260 to 315 (273) μm, and is lined by 35 to 42 (37) stichocytes. The back region of <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> is 4.5 to 6.2 (5.1) mm long. The back, or rectal, opening of the digestive tube is located {{near the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>worm,</b> and the length of the cloaca is 530 to 576 (550) μm. Near the back end, there are two alae (ridges) at the sides (laterally), which are 40 to 55 (46) μm long; these are located at 10 to 15 μm from another, small ala at the tip. In A.putorii, the lateral alae are much longer and reach the ala at the tip. The spicule, a spikelike structure that functions in reproduction, is curved at the tip and hardened and has a length of 380 to 426 (406) μm. It is smaller than that of the similar A.tamiasstriati from North American chipmunks and larger than that of A.murissylvatici from various North American and European small rodents, but about as long as that of A.putorii, which however lacks the curved tip.|$|E
5|$|Each worm {{begins the}} round with a {{specific}} amount of health, which is predefined by the chosen game options or by scripting in campaign levels. When hit with a weapon, <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> will lose health depending upon {{the power of the}} weapon and the directness of the hit. A worm can be killed either by exploding after having its health reduced to zero or by being knocked into the water around and below the level.|$|E

Invertebrates identified in the area include two species endemic to the hydrothermal vents, a bresiliid shrimp (Opaepele loihi) of the family Alvinocarididae (described in 1995), and a tube or pogonophoran worm.

5|$|Paterson's worms are {{a family}} of {{cellular}} automata devised in 1971 by Mike Paterson and John Horton Conway to model the behaviour and feeding patterns of certain prehistoric worms. In the model, a worm moves between points on a triangular grid along line segments, representing food. Its turnings {{are determined by the}} configuration of eaten and uneaten line segments adjacent to the point at which <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> currently is. Despite being governed by simple rules the behaviour of the worms can be extremely complex, and the ultimate fate of one variant is still unknown.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} toxicological risks from sodium accumulation in a vermifiltration wastewater treatment system to <b>the</b> key <b>worm</b> species, Eisenia fetida. The study found that sodium chloride (NaCl) is the more toxic of the common sodium salts found in wastewater to <b>the</b> <b>worms.</b> <b>The</b> research further found that <b>the</b> <b>worms</b> have an ability to detoxify NaCl although reproduction will be impaired if <b>the</b> <b>worms</b> are exposed to moderate concentrations of NaCl {{for a long period}} of time. The actual risk from NaCl toxicity in the vermifiltration process was low however. The low risk was due to the low solid-water partitioning constant of NaCl, which led to a very low predicted environmental concentration (PEC) for NaCl...|$|R

50|$|Infection {{symptoms}} {{are similar to}} infection by other Toxacara species (T. canis, T. cati). It is a common cause of diarrhea in young animals and can cause vomiting as well. Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>worms</b> themselves are vomited up, which can be alarming {{as they can be}} quite large with females reaching lengths of up to seven inches. <b>The</b> <b>worms</b> consume <b>the</b> host's food and can lead to lethargy and a classical pot-bellied appearance.

5|$|Aonchotheca forresteri is a {{parasitic}} nematode that infects {{the marsh}} rice rat (Oryzomys palustris) in Florida. Occurring mainly in adults, it inhabits the stomach. It {{is much more}} common during the wet season, perhaps because its unknown intermediate host is an earthworm that only emerges when it rains. <b>The</b> <b>worm</b> was discovered in 1970 and formally described in 1987. Originally classified in the genus Capillaria, it was reclassified in Aonchotheca in 1999. A.forresteri is small and narrow-bodied, with a length of 13.8 to 19.4mm in females and 6.8 to 9.2mm in males. Similar species such as A.putorii differ in features of the alae and spicule (organs in the male), {{the size of the}} female, and the texture of the eggs.|$|E
5|$|Aonchotheca forresteri is a small, narrow-bodied worm. It is narrowest at {{the front}} and {{increases}} in width to about three fourths of its length. The cuticle, the surface layer, is smooth. Females are 13.8 to 19.4mm long, averaging 16.9mm, which makes them substantially longer than female A.putorii, and 55 to 70 (average 62) μm wide. The eggs are smooth, lacking the elaborate pattern on the surface seen in A.putorii, and are 53 to 58 (54) μm long and 21 to 24 (21) μm broad. The esophagus, the frontmost part of the digestive system, is 2.9 to 3.9 (3.6) mm long and is lined by 36 to 45 (40) cells known as stichocytes. The vulva is located 66 to 105 (83) μm behind {{the end of the}} esophagus and the anus is near the end of <b>the</b> <b>worm,</b> which is rounded.|$|E
5|$|Chinese Nü Yr is an electronica album using {{elements}} of bass, grime and 2-step garage.

Xiāngjiāo is forced to go through portals in colorful and nonsensical lands, having to dodge things such as peanuts, floating fruit, pink-colored fog, and mountains growing out of the ground.
