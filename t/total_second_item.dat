A <b>second</b> data <b>item</b> VERS-BYTES is defined as a two-character alphanumeric variable. Since the <b>second</b> <b>item</b> is redefined over the first item, the two items share the same address in memory, and therefore share the same underlying data bytes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{validate}} the Proactive Coping Scale in a Chinese population sample. A total of 313 college students participated in Taiwan in the study. They completed the Chinese version of the Proactive Coping Scale (PCS), Self Esteem Scale (SES), Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R) and depression and anxiety subscale of Symptom Checklist 90 -Revised (SCL 90 -R). The results demonstrated that items of the PCS had good internal reliability, factorial validity and construct validity except for the <b>second</b> <b>item</b> (i. e., I try to let things work out on their own). The <b>second</b> <b>item</b> implies the meaning of “let-it-happen in a natural way”, which might have a different interpretation in Western culture from the prevalent proactive coping style that was observed in Chinese culture. Therefore, the study suggested the <b>second</b> <b>item</b> of PCS should be deleted while measuring the Chinese proactive coping style...|$|R
