5|$|Homer signs {{his family}} {{up for the}} show. Marge is traded to a nice, easygoing man named Charles Heathbar and his perfect son, while Homer gets Charles' strict wife Verity. Charles {{seems to be a}} husband who dislikes his wife and is {{constantly}} told by her what to do, so he is surprised to see that Marge is understanding and kind. As Marge enjoys her time with Charles, he begins to develop an infatuation for her. Meanwhile, Homer, Bart, and Lisa are having major troubles with Verity, who disciplines them and objects <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> they do.|$|E
5|$|I {{feel that}} {{talking about it}} trivializes it. I've been {{studying}} the Cabala , which is the mystical interpretation of the Torah. I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga and obviously I {{know a lot about}} Catholicism. There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, and I find that very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is to be open <b>to</b> <b>everything.</b> Pay attention to what makes sense, be absorbed. For me, yoga is the closest thing to our real nature.|$|E
5|$|Hunters {{primarily}} {{attack the}} player by bracing themselves and firing bursts from their flechette cannon. Four flechettes can vaporize an ordinary human soldier. If {{they do not}} strike a living target, the flechette charge up for several seconds and then explode, dealing minor damage <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> nearby. Hunters may also conduct a charging attack or strike with their legs if the player gets too close. Hunters are vulnerable to all weapons, but to compensate, are still quite resilient, making explosives and the pulse rifle's charged energy ball the most attractive options. Objects thrown with the gravity gun are also effective, especially if the player catches some of their flechettes with the object before hurling it (one of the in-game Achievements). In outdoor environments, they can be run over with a vehicle.|$|E

5|$|Mulder goes {{to see the}} Shooter, despite Spender's objections. Mulder {{wants to}} give the Shooter {{immunity}} in exchange for testimony, which the Shooter refuses. Gibson proves his abilities {{to a group of}} clinicians while Scully and Fowley watch. The guard at the prison hands the Shooter a flattened Morley cigarette box that says he's a dead man. Scully visits the Lone Gunmen, wanting them to analyze the data from Gibson. She asks them who Diana is, and they tell her she worked closely with Mulder when he discovered the X-Files. The Smoking Man meets with Jeffrey in the FBI parking lot, but disappears when Mulder spots them talking. Scully and Mulder present to Skinner on Gibson, who displays extraordinary brain activities. Mulder believes that Gibson is the key <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> in the X-Files, and wants to make a deal with the Shooter. Diana and Skinner think this may result in adverse attention from the attorney general, and that the X-Files could be closed down if things go wrong, but Mulder dismisses that risk.|$|E
5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides <b>to</b> <b>{{everything}}.</b> For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} episodes of Carnivàle, Ben's {{parentage}} {{is one of}} the big puzzles. As a man named Henry Scudder seems connected <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> and everyone, it is Ben's job to piece together the mystery of his own past. The progressing series indicates many characters are more closely interrelated than what both the characters and the audience would imagine at first. Although these links rarely receive plot attention, the immediate genealogy of the main characters is cleared up {{by the end of the}} second season. Other character links that were largely unanswered after Carnivàles cancellation concern the trench war and the Hyde&Teller Company in relation to the emergence of the Carnivàle. Show creator Daniel Knauf, character biographies on the HBO website and the Pitch Document later provided detail for what was originally envisioned. Although the nature of these sources does not qualify them for canon status, they provide a framework for hints dropped in the series.|$|E

5|$|Before season 20, {{little was}} shown {{concerning}} Cartman's romantic interests, {{as for the}} most part, his attitude towards females had been sexist. However, at least in one episode ("Chef Goes Nanners"), Cartman develops an attraction to Wendy, which is apparent {{from the end of}} episode when Wendy describes her temporary infatuation towards Cartman as 'sexual tension' and even though Cartman agrees in front of Wendy, he sighs with sorrow at being alone again. During a period when he was physically unable to control his speech and he repeatedly blurted hidden feelings, he expressed a romantic interest in classmate Patty Nelson, a side character who has not been seen before or since. In Season 20, after Cartman is wrongfully accused of being a persistent and highly aggressive internet troll (actually Gerald Broflovski) leaving foul posts primarily targeting women and girls on South Park Elementary's school message boards, the other boys destroy most of Cartman's electronics, and by extension, his social media presence, causing him to become despondent <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> around him. That is until Heidi Turner, who had quit social media in response to the trolling, offers to show him life outside of social media. The two quickly become friends, and later, an official and shockingly very happy couple.|$|E
5|$|Halotus, as the Emperor's {{official}} taster, {{would probably}} have {{had a role in}} the plot, deceiving Claudius into believing the food was safe to consume. He is a prime suspect because he would have had access <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> eaten by the Emperor on the night of his death. It has been suggested that Halotus may have been the murderer but was working under orders of Agrippina. While it is uncertain whether Halotus would have had anything to gain from the death of the Emperor, Agrippina's political and personal advantage gained by the death of her husband was evident; with Claudius dead, Nero, Agrippina's biological son, would be able to claim the throne. It was also known that the animosity between Agrippina and Claudius had grown during the months preceding the homicide. Other notable suspects included Locusta, a professional poisoner, and Xenophon, Claudius' royal physician, who, in line with the suggestion that the poison was not immediately fatal, is said to have carried an ailing Claudius out of the banquet, taken him to his room and forced a poisoned feather into his mouth on the pretence of encouraging him to regurgitate. Others say Xenophon used poisoned gruel.|$|E
5|$|Stewie rams a toy {{spaceship}} into Peter's ear, annoying him, so Peter throws Rupert {{into the}} basement. Stewie follows the bear, discovering an old television script that Brian wrote entitled What I Learned on Jefferson Street. Stewie tosses the script onto the kitchen table, prompting Lois to question {{what it is}} about. Brian suggests she read it and tell him what she thinks. Lois {{falls in love with}} it, and suggests he meet with network executives about producing the show. When Brian pitches it to CBS, the executives respond positively. While the initial casting session goes well, with Elijah Wood auditioning for the lead, the producers assigned by the executives also bring in James Woods, who performs the role in a more comedic fashion, winning over the executives. Brian's serious drama is turned into a sitcom, bringing in a live studio audience as well as a chimpanzee, and renaming it Class Holes. When Brian objects to the changes, the producers remind him of what he had tried to achieve for many years—his own television show—and threaten him with unemployment if he objects to those changes. Disappointed that Brian allowed the executives to change his show so dramatically, Lois demands that he stand up for himself and object <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> James Woods changed about the show. The producers, however, do not take kindly to Brian's desire to start over, so Brian quits in frustration. Brian reveals his disappointment that he no longer has his own television show, but Lois convinces him that it is his integrity that matters. Peter interrupts, with his own show appearing on the screen, entitled Bigger Jaws.|$|E

25|$|The Rado graph {{satisfies}} the following extension property: for any finite disjoint sets of vertices U and V, {{there exists a}} vertex x connected <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> in U, and to nothing in V.|$|E
25|$|If a graph G {{is formed}} from the Rado graph by {{deleting}} any finite number of edges or vertices, or adding {{a finite number}} of edges, the change does not affect the extension property of the graph: for any pair of sets U and V it is still possible to find a vertex in the modified graph that is adjacent <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> in U and nonadjacent <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> in V, by adding the modified parts of G to V and applying the extension property in the unmodified Rado graph. Therefore, any finite modification of this type results in a graph that is isomorphic to the Rado graph.|$|E
