5|$|During <b>that</b> <b>spring,</b> several white couple/black couple {{tests of}} real estate offices {{uncovered}} racial steering: discriminatory processing of housing requests by couples who were exact matches in income, background, number of children, and other attributes. Several larger marches were planned and executed: in Bogan, Belmont Cragin, Jefferson Park, Evergreen Park (a suburb southwest of Chicago), Gage Park, Marquette Park, and others.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the draft}} treaty of January 1916, apprehensions grew in Delhi of trouble from tribes in the North-West Frontier Province. <b>That</b> <b>spring,</b> Indian {{intelligence}} received rumours {{of letters from}} Habibullah to his tribal chiefs exhorting holy jihad. Alarmed, Hardinge called 3,000 tribal chiefs to a grand Jirga in Peshawar, where aerial bombing displays were held; Hardinge demonstrated the Empire's goodwill by increasing British subsidies to the chiefs. These measures helped convince the frontier tribes that Britain's wartime position remained strong and that Indian defences were impregnable.|$|E

5|$|Grimaldi and Dubois {{appeared}} {{together again}} later <b>that</b> <b>spring</b> at Sadler's Wells in Dibdin's Harlequin Alchemist, which {{set up a}} mock duel between the two Clowns, with the audience deciding who could pull the most hideous face. Grimaldi consistently won. In the next piece, Harlequin Benedick; or, The Ghost of Mother Shipton. Dubois was relegated {{to the role of}} Pierrot, while Grimaldi played Clown. Grimaldi's mother was in the cast, appearing as the Butcher's Wife. He then appeared in another Dibdin play, The Great Devil. During the run, he accidentally injured himself on stage by shooting himself in the foot and was confined to bed for five weeks. His mother became so concerned at her son's fragile and still grief-stricken state that she employed a dancer at Drury Lane, Mary Bristow, to care for him full-time during those weeks. They formed a close friendship, which resulted in a loving relationship, and they married on 24 December 1801.|$|E

5|$|In 1913 to 1914 Jolin {{started to}} paint {{in his own}} naïve {{interpretation}} of Expressionism. By {{the end of the}} 1910s his works became more expressed and the shapes more plastic, but in 1916, Jolin's paintings were still inspired by the years he spent in France. <b>That</b> <b>spring,</b> members of the Konstnärsförbundet (The Artists Association) and their young pupils, were invited to present the new style, Expressionism, to the Swedish audience as exhibition number two (number one being Anders Zorn, Bruno Liljefors and Carl Larsson) at the new art venue, the Liljevalchs konsthall, in Djurgården. Participating in the second exhibition were a number of noted Swedish artists at that time, including Leander Engström, Isaac Grünewald, Gösta Sandels, Birger Simonsson and Jolin who exhibited thirteen paintings.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, the Nazis {{decided to}} {{increase}} greatly the gassing capacity of Birkenau. Crematorium II, {{which had been}} designed as a mortuary with morgues {{in the basement and}} ground-level incinerators, was converted into a killing factory by installing gas-tight doors, vents for the Zyklon B (a highly lethal cyanide-based pesticide) to be dropped into the chamber, and ventilation equipment to remove the gas thereafter. It went into operation in March. Crematorium III was built using the same design. Crematoria IV and V, designed from the start as gassing centers, were also constructed <b>that</b> <b>spring.</b> By June 1943, all four crematoria were operational. Most of the victims were killed using these four structures.|$|E
5|$|Later <b>that</b> <b>spring</b> Bryant and Reed heeded Vorse's call {{to spend}} the warm season in Provincetown, Massachusetts, {{at the tip of}} Cape Cod, and {{to take part in the}} {{communal}} theater productions of the Provincetown Players. Others from the Village went as well and joined the group, organized in 1915 by George Cram Cook and his wife, Susan Glaspell, who hoped to produce plays that were both political and artistic. Among the works the group staged in 1916 were Bryant's The Game, in which characters named Life and Death play dice for the lives of Youth (a poet) and Girl (a dancer). It appeared on the same bill as Not Smart by Wilbur Steele and Bound East for Cardiff by O'Neill.|$|E

5|$|Mary Phagan {{was born}} on June 1, 1899, into an {{established}} Georgia family of tenant farmers. Her father died before she was born. Shortly after Mary's birth, her mother, Frances Phagan, moved the family back to their hometown of Marietta, Georgia. During or after 1907, they again relocated to East Point, Georgia, in southwest Atlanta, where Frances opened a boarding house. Mary Phagan left school at age 10 to work part-time in a textile mill. In 1912, after her mother married John William Coleman, the family moved into the city of Atlanta. <b>That</b> <b>spring,</b> Phagan took {{a job with the}} National Pencil Company, where she earned ten cents an hour operating a knurling machine that inserted rubber erasers into the metal tips of pencils, and worked 55 hours per week. She worked {{on the second floor of}} the factory in the metal room in a section called the tipping department, which was across the hallway from Leo Frank's office.|$|E
5|$|The neutral trading {{powers were}} {{still trying to}} arrange a peace. At Elateia, Philip had met with the same would-be peacemakers from Egypt and Rhodes who {{had been at the}} meeting in Heraclea, and again in the spring of 207 BC, but to no avail. Representatives of Egypt, Rhodes, Byzantium, Chios, Mytilene and perhaps Athens also met again with the Aetolians <b>that</b> <b>spring.</b> The war was going Philip's way, but the Aetolians, {{although}} now abandoned by both Pergamon and Rome, were not yet ready to make peace on Philip's terms. However, after another season's fighting, they finally relented. In 206 BC, the Aetolians, without Rome's consent, sued for a separate peace on conditions imposed by Philip.|$|E
5|$|The next year, 1894, saw {{pay cuts}} and labor disturbances, {{including}} a massive strike by the {{workers at the}} Pullman Company. A group of unemployed workers, known as Coxey's Army, marched on Washington <b>that</b> <b>spring.</b> Weaver met with them in Iowa and expressed sympathy with the movement, {{so long as they}} refrained from lawbreaking. He then returned to the campaign trail, stumping for Populist candidates in the 1894 midterm elections. The election proved disastrous for the Democrats, but most of the gains went to the Republicans rather than to the Populists, who gained a few seats in the South but lost ground in the West. During the election, Weaver became friendly with William Jennings Bryan, a Democratic Congressman from Nebraska and a charismatic supporter of free silver. Bryan had lost his bid for the Senate in the election, but his reputation as an exciting speaker made him a presidential possibility in 1896.|$|E

Thompson was knighted in January 1799 and given a pension of £200 per annum, returning to service <b>that</b> <b>spring</b> as captain of HMS Bellona attached to the Channel Fleet under Lord Bridport.|$|E
5|$|Wilkins Peak is not gated, {{and it can}} {{be reached}} via an unpaved road known as Wilkins Peak Road that starts on U.S. Route 191 {{southwest}} of Rock Springs, Wyoming. The mountain can also be accessed via another unpaved road that begins in the Scott's Bottom Nature Area in Green River, Wyoming. The peak is accessible year-round, weather permitting. The Green River access road is in worse shape than the Rock Springs side, and it has several road hazards such as steep grades, poor grading, and off-road vehicle traffic. Along with serving radio needs, the peak also is a popular hiking and mountain biking location in the area. There are many smaller roads and trails <b>that</b> <b>spring</b> from the peak that offer varied degrees of challenge.|$|E
5|$|After a {{month of}} training, McKinley and the 23rd Ohio, now led by Colonel Eliakim P. Scammon, set out for western Virginia (today part of West Virginia) in July 1861 {{as a part of}} the Kanawha Division. McKinley {{initially}} thought Scammon was a martinet, but when the regiment finally saw battle, he came to appreciate the value of their relentless drilling. Their first contact with the enemy came in September when they drove back Confederate troops at Carnifex Ferry in present-day West Virginia. Three days after the battle, McKinley was assigned to duty in the brigade quartermaster office, where he worked both to supply his regiment, and as a clerk. In November, the regiment established winter quarters near Fayetteville (today in West Virginia). McKinley spent the winter substituting for a commissary sergeant who was ill, and in April 1862 he was promoted to that rank. The regiment resumed its advance <b>that</b> <b>spring</b> with Hayes in command (Scammon by then led the brigade) and fought several minor engagements against the rebel forces.|$|E
