50|$|Since 2005, {{the video}} game {{industry}} grew quickly, with projections that it will reach a $100 billion global industry by 2018. As early as 2008, there was discussion and arguments from the actors' unions that {{the video game}} industry should pay residuals on sales to actors, seeking equality with other entertainment industries, {{with the potential for}} a strike action if the industry did not agree. Michael Hollick stated that he had only been paid about $100,000 for his voice work as the principle character in Grand Theft Auto IV, which went on to bring in more than $600 million in sales within its first three weeks of release. Despite this discussion, SAG-AFTRA and the industry negotiated continuations on the Interactive Media Agreement without inclusion of residuals; in the most recent successful negotiation, to extend the Interactive Media Agreement through 2014, the two sides <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>account</b> for additional session fees for actors in games designed for cloud gaming.|$|R
40|$|As both {{a private}} U. S. {{investor}} and a current accounting student, I {{am grateful for}} the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule.

Having benefited from a university course specific to international accounting and having worked with international accountants to some extent, I believe that getting the US <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> on harmonized <b>accounting</b> practices {{with the rest of the}} world would result in several advantages to both U. S. investors and the international community: a) Investors in the U. S. will be able to broaden their equity universe because more foreign financials will be comparable enough to US GAAP to be understandable; b) Foreign investors will be able to raise more capital and gain U. S. investors for the same reasons, and spend less money in the process; c) Companies maintaining operations in many countries should find it easier to prepare their consolidated financials and manage global finances since so many of their subsidiaries would already be using the parent accounting system or on...|$|R

40|$|With the {{publication}} of The Divided Self in 1960, R. D. Laing initiated the British ‘anti-psychiatry’ movement which was to challenge the hegemony of conventional medical and psychoanalytical models of madness during that decade and beyond. Anti-psychiatric thinking coincided {{with the beginning of}} the second wave of feminism and the two movements coalesced within a number of literary texts, most notably Doris Lessing’s The Golden Notebook. However, whilst Lessing appears <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> with Laing’s <b>account</b> of schizophrenia and, indeed, largely bases her own representations of madness on his understanding of that experience, her texts nevertheless struggle to fully realise the potential of his theories for women. With reference to The Golden Notebook and her later novels The Four-Gated City and Briefing for a Descent into Hell, I argue that Lessing’s fiction complicates Laing’s theories by demonstrating the significance of the sex/gender system, so conspicuously absent in his works, to women’s experiences of schizophrenia. Lessing’s ‘madness novels’ suggest that Laing’s ultimate aim to deconstruct the sanity/madness binary remains unrealised for the madwoman because of his inattention to that binary’s associative opposition: male/female. This thesis examines Lessing’s engagement with Laing and argues that any straightforward relationship between his theory and her fiction is complicated by the discourses of gendered embodiment he fails to account for but which continues to define and bind Lessing’s female characters. Using contemporary feminist body theory, I read the female body as a site of contention in and between Lessing’s and Laing’s texts and, finally, as (an) irresolvable ‘matter’ in anti-psychiatry’s understanding of the experience of madness.
