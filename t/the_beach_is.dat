5|$|The visitor centre {{and shop}} are open daily except Christmas Day and Boxing Day. Most {{of the reserve}} and its {{facilities}} are wheelchair accessible, but {{the last part of}} the path to <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> rough, and accessed via a steep bank.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> {{popular with}} summer tourists, {{and has a}} {{campsite}} on the nearby fields. The beach has a snack bar and restaurant and associated amenities to cater for the increased public demand in recent years. There is an expansive rocky beach at low tide, with a stretch of sand towards the far west, and views of the Bristol Channel and the coastline of Somerset, with the landmark white roof of Butlins, Minehead.|$|E
5|$|The {{panorama}} on the Library punchbowl {{begins with}} a view of the eastern shore of Sydney Cove. In the foreground is an octagonal two-storey, yellow, sandstone house ①, built by Governor Macquarie in 1812 for his favourite boatman and former water bailiff, Billy or William Blue. The drawing of this little house – now the site of the Sydney Opera House — is out of all proportion to its actual modest size. To the left of the house is a sandy beach where the Circular Quay ferry wharves now stand. Facing <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> First Government House ② where the Museum of Sydney is now situated.|$|E
5000|$|... "Admiral, <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>are</b> narrow... {{but there}} are no mines, no coral heads, no boulders, no wire, no boat {{obstacles}} and no offshore reefs. <b>The</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>are</b> as flat as a billiard table!" ...|$|R
50|$|When Lefkada {{was hit by}} an {{earthquake}} in 2015, <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>was</b> badly damaged. Geologists estimated that <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> will <b>be</b> restored naturally over time.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>was</b> {{opened to}} <b>the</b> public on 22 June 1975. The resort at <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} operated by Taiwan Railways Administration. It was then later {{transferred to the}} Northeast and Yilan Coast National Scenic Area Administration of Tourism Bureau.|$|R
5|$|The {{town has}} sandy beaches at both St Mildred's Bay and West Bay. The larger of the beaches is at St Mildred's Bay, {{where it is}} {{possible}} to hire beach huts, deck chairs and jet-skis. <b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> a short distance from tennis courts and a golf putting course. At West Bay, there are many small rock pools, which are popular with children. Each beach has nearby cafés, restaurants and public houses, and a European Blue Flag Award is shared between them due to their cleanliness and safety.|$|E
5|$|At Kilve are {{the remains}} of a red brick retort, built in 1924, when it was {{discovered}} that the shale found in the cliffs was rich in oil. <b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> part of the Blue Anchor to Lilstock Coast SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest). Along this coast the cliffs are layered with compressed strata of oil-bearing shale and blue, yellow and brown lias embedded with fossils. In 1924 Forbes-Leslie founded the Shaline Company to exploit them. This retort house is thought to be the first structure erected here for the conversion of shale to oil but the company was unable to raise sufficient capital and this is now all that remains of the anticipated Somerset oil boom.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eastern}} side of Exmouth, the coast path climbs up onto the High Land of Orcombe. This is the start of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site. The next town is Budleigh Salterton, beyond which lies the River Otter. The path then skirts Chiselbury Bay and Ladram Bay towards Sidmouth which sits {{at the mouth of the}} River Sid. Access to <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> via a wooden {{staircase}} known as Jacob's ladder. Sidmouth is surrounded by the East Devon AONB. Erosion remains a serious concern east of the mouth of the River Sid. The cliffs have been heavily eroded, threatening cliff top homes and the footpath, which passes along the tops of the cliff, around Lyme Bay, avoiding The Undercliff towards Branscombe. The path then follows Seaton Bay past Beer, with Beer Quarry Caves a man-made cave complex, resulting from the quarrying of Beer stone and Seaton before going through The Undercliff SSSI and NNR and crossing the border into Dorset shortly before reaching Lyme Regis.|$|E
50|$|At <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> there <b>is</b> a small snack stand, {{and chairs}} and {{umbrellas}} for rent. Four-wheel drive cars, for driving around <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> <b>are</b> also available to rent.|$|R
50|$|Historically, <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>was</b> {{known as}} Yung Lung <b>Beach</b> and <b>was</b> a very {{attractive}} place for swimming. It was closed for swimming in 1981 due to poor water quality. In September 1983 <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>was</b> badly damaged by a typhoon that caused the loss of sand and trees.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>was</b> {{featured}} in <b>the</b> film Atonement (2007): a postcard of the coastguard cottage overlooking <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>was</b> a central {{element of the}} plot, with Robbie Turner focusing on it as the idyll where he and Cecilia Tallis would retire after World War II.|$|R
5|$|Tanjung Aru, {{located about}} 6kilometres {{from the city}} centre, {{is one of the}} beaches along the West Coast. Its name was derived from the casuarina trees (locally called Aru trees) that grow on the shoreline. <b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> 3kilometres in length. The {{entrance}} car parking area to Tanjung Aru has increase in size as the previous building that were on the site have been demolished in 2017. In the vicinity of Tanjung Aru lies the Kinabalu Golf Club, Prince Philip Botanical Park, KK Yacht Club, and Shangri-La's Tanjung Aru Beach Resort. Prince Phillip Park is freely accessible to the public, while the others need a permission. This beach is famous for its sunset.|$|E
5|$|The beach of Weston Bay lies on {{the western}} edge of the town. The upper part is sandy, but the sea retreats a long way at low tide, exposing large areas of mud flats (hence the colloquial name of Weston-super-Mud). The tidal range in this part of the Bristol Channel is great, and since beach and mud flats are on a gentle slope, it is inadvisable to try to reach the sea at low tide, as the sand gives way to deep mud which has often {{resulted}} in loss of life over the years. Driving on <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> permitted in certain areas, but occasionally the drivers are caught unawares as they drive too close to the sea and break through the sand into the underlying mud, and are then stuck.|$|E
5|$|The {{rest of the}} SSSI {{is close}} to the A149 coast road, and can be {{accessed}} at many points by footpaths or roads. The main nature-orientated facilities are on the major reserves. Holme Dunes NNR is accessed from Holme-next-the-Sea. It has a visitor centre, three bird hides, one of which has disabled access, and a 4km (2.5mi) nature trail. The other reserves are all adjacent to the A149. Titchwell Marsh RSPB is just west of Titchwell village and has a visitor centre, café and hides. Most of the reserve and its facilities are wheelchair accessible, but {{the last part of the}} footpath to <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> rough, and crosses a steep bank. The two bird hides at Holkham NNR can be reached from the end of Lady Anne's Drive in Holkham village; there is also a car park further east on Beach Road, Wells-next-the-Sea. Cley Marshes visitor centre and car park are to the south of the A149, opposite the main reserve. The centre and four of the five bird hides are accessible to people with limited mobility.|$|E
50|$|The Pelabuhan Ratu's {{white sands}} <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> a popular {{vacation}} destination for visitors from Sukabumi, Bogor, Bandung and Jakarta. However, {{because of high}} rolling waves, some spots on <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>are</b> considered too dangerous for swimming. Together with Pangandaran, <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>are</b> popular in West Java, both facing south towards the Indian Ocean.|$|R
50|$|The Biloxi wade-ins {{were three}} protests that {{occurred}} on <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> of Biloxi, Mississippi, between 1959 and 1963. The demonstrations {{were led by}} Dr. Gilbert R. Mason, Sr. {{in an effort to}} desegregate <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> of <b>the</b> Mississippi Gulf Coast. Before <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>were</b> desegregated homeowners claimed <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> as private property, and although <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>were</b> built by <b>the</b> Army Corps of Engineers using taxpayer funds, African Americans were restricted to designated areas of the beachfront. The effort to keep <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> segregated <b>was</b> supported by the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> public <b>beaches</b> <b>are</b> groomed on {{a regular}} basis by the city. Because sand no longer {{naturally}} deposits on <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> it <b>is</b> replenished in regular beach nourishment projects using dredged sand. <b>The</b> south facing <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> without significant obstructions and is in sunlight all day. <b>The</b> public <b>beaches</b> <b>are</b> open to all without restriction, and there is no charge for use. <b>The</b> <b>beach</b> area <b>is</b> divided into [...] "bays", areas of beach delineated by rock groynes, which moderate erosion and the force of ocean waves.|$|R
5|$|The zone where land meets sea {{is known}} as the coast and the part between the lowest spring tides and the upper limit reached by {{splashing}} waves is the shore. A beach is the accumulation of sand or shingle on the shore. A headland is a point of land jutting out into the sea and a larger promontory {{is known as}} a cape. The indentation of a coastline—especially between two headlands—is a bay; a small bay with a narrow inlet is a cove and a large bay or bay-shaped sea may be referred to as a gulf. Coastlines are influenced by a number of factors including the strength of the waves arriving on the shore, the gradient of the land margin, the composition and hardness of the coastal rock, the inclination of the off-shore slope, and the changes of the level of the land due to local uplift or submergence. Normally, waves roll towards the shore at the rate of six to eight per minute. These are known as constructive waves as they tend to move material up the beach and have little erosive effect. Storm waves arrive on shore in rapid succession and are known as destructive waves, as their swash moves beach material seawards. Under their influence, the sand and shingle on <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> ground together and abraded. Around high tide, the power of a storm wave impacting on the foot of a cliff has a shattering effect as air in cracks and crevices is compressed and then expands rapidly with release of pressure. At the same time, sand and pebbles have an erosive effect as they are thrown against the rocks. Along with other weathering processes such as frost, this tends to undercut the cliff. Gradually, a wave-cut platform develops {{at the foot of the}} cliff and this has a protective effect, reducing further wave-erosion.|$|E
25|$|Swimming is {{open from}} late May to mid-September, from 8 am to sunset each day. <b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> sand, with a lawn beside it. No {{lifeguard}} is on duty.|$|E
25|$|Situated at {{the north}} end of Sunny Bay, on <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> <b>is</b> a large granite rock on which a {{concrete}} platform has been constructed. Recessed edges on the platform indicate that it once supported walls.|$|E
50|$|Diano Marina {{is one of}} the few {{municipalities}} {{along the}} Ligurian coast with long sandy <b>beaches.</b> <b>The</b> <b>beach</b> season <b>is</b> from May 15 until September 15. Outside of <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> season most of <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>are</b> accessible to <b>the</b> public.|$|R
5000|$|The various {{rides and}} attractions {{that began to}} spring up along <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>were</b> {{separately}} owned by various concessionaires. For example, John Friedle owned a [...] and baseball-throwing concession. All of the rides at Chutes at <b>the</b> <b>Beach</b> <b>were</b> purchased new or built there, including the Shoot-the-Chutes, which inspired the first official name for the amusement area—Chutes at <b>the</b> <b>Beach.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} in 1974 by surfers who started to explore <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> north beyond Guarujá.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> a {{combination}} of sand and shingle. In 2005/6 it was further protected by a coastal management scheme which includes beach nourishment, new groynes {{on the south side}} of the pier and riprap to the north.|$|E
25|$|Construction of {{any kind}} on <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> {{prohibited}} without a vote of the people, allowing Huntington Beach to retain its natural connection to the ocean rather than having the view obstructed by residential and commercial developments.|$|E
25|$|Thirumullavaram {{beach is}} one among the twin {{beautiful}} beaches in the Cashew Capital of the World. It is {{at a distance}} of 6km away from the heart of the city. The secluded beach soothe your mind and body with its natural beauty. The beach will give an estuary feel for the tourists as the area is full of coconut palms which makes the place a shady paradise and it is a very silent place. <b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> ideal for early morning walks <b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> ideal for swimming and sun bathing and no danger zones are identified. <b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> connected with all the major roads around the state and it can be easily accessed to reach the place. The taste of local cuisine that is mostly flavoured with coconut and spices like cardamom, black pepper, cloves, cinnamon and ginger also attract a good number of visitors. A water hillock named Njarazhcha Para which means Sunday Rock, is another allurement for the tourists visiting here. During low tides, this hillock can be seen clearly from the shore about one and a half km into the sea.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>was</b> used in 2012 to {{test the}} Olympic torch.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>was</b> for whites only.|$|R
50|$|It {{has a large}} coastline; <b>the</b> main <b>beaches</b> <b>are</b> located to <b>the</b> south.The main {{rivers in}} the Playas Canton are: Arena River, Moñones and Tambiche.The weather is hot and dry. <b>The</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>are</b> freshened by <b>the</b> ocean wind.|$|R
25|$|Cactus Bay – Considered by many Waihekeans as {{the most}} perfect beach and, with nearby Garden Cove, a romantic place for picnicking. <b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> {{accessible}} only by boat or kayak, as its land access was blocked off by a private landowner.|$|E
25|$|The {{flat and}} scenic route {{alongside}} <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> {{very popular with}} cyclists, and {{is the start of}} the Trans Pennine Trail, a cycle route running across the north of the country to Selby in North Yorkshire, through Hull and on to Hornsea on the east coast.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> {{covered with}} shells and {{suitable}} for swimming at high tide. The water is shallow, and sand lies under the shells {{for the children}} to enjoy. At low tide many shallow pools become exposed on the almost level rock foreshore which children find fascinating to explore.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to its {{renaming}} in 1988, Buono <b>Beach</b> <b>was</b> called Penny <b>Beach.</b> Although <b>the</b> {{origin of}} that name is unknown, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation surmises that <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>was</b> named for either the original name of Hylan Boulevard (Pennsylvania Avenue), or because <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>was</b> once a [...] "lovers' lane" [...] where couples would toss coins into the harbor while making wishes.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>was</b> awarded Keep Britain Tidy's Quality Coast Award in 2011.|$|R
50|$|During the 1970s, the park, {{specifically}} <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> <b>was</b> {{suffering from}} {{large amounts of}} erosion from storms. State and Federal funding <b>was</b> provided and <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>were</b> rebuilt and jetties were added to help prevent further damage. Development on the Yanty Creek Nature trail began as well. It is now a mile-long trail with educational markers along the way.|$|R
