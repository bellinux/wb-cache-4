To simultaneously determine diethylene glycol (DEG) along with ethylene glycol, methanol, isopropanol, acetone, and ethanol, we modified a previously developed gas chromatographic (<b>GC)</b> method. <b>The</b> system used a Hewlett-Packard 6890 GC with EPC, a Gooseneck splitless liner, and an Rtx- 200 capillary column (30 m x 0. 53 -ram i. d., 3 ram). After serum samples were deproteinized using ultrafiltration (MUlipore Ultrafree | 1 mL of the protein-free filtrate was manually injected into <b>the</b> <b>GC.</b> <b>Internal</b> <b>standards</b> for alcohols (and acetone) and glycols were n-propanol and 1, 3 -butanediol, respectively.

Limit of detection and linear ange for all compounds were 1 or 2. 5 mg/dt and 0 - 500 mg/dL, respectively. In addition, there was no interference from propionic acid, propylene glycol, and 2, 3 -butanediol.

40|$|Inductively-Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) is {{evaluated}} as {{a method}} for the selective determination of several non-metals which emit light in the Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV) region of the spectrum. In this study, {{emphasis is placed on}} those elements which are totally unobservable with standard techniques or have very weak lines in the UV-VIS region of the spectrum. The sensitivity and accuracy of the apparatus and methods devised allows the determination of empirical formulas of gas chromatographic effluents. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the background emission of the ICP in the VUV is low level and nearly constant over the entire spectral region investigated (125 - 185 nm.). Promising analytical lines for oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine, bromine, and carbon are also observed in this region. A progression of four experimental configurations were constructed, employing a purged optical path and a unique coolant tube design. The last of these configurations has the capability of spatial resolution of individual portions of the discharge so that emission maps and profiles could be constructed. The results of the maps generated indicate that the region of highest emission intensity is always centered in the discharge. However, the vertical position of this region is found to be dependent upon r. f. power and argon flow rates. Detection limits in the low nanogram region are observed for each non-metal. The dynamic range for each element is in excess of 10 ⁴ and the selectivity ratio versus carbon is above 100 in each case. A method was developed for determining the elemental composition of the effluents of a <b>GC.</b> Using <b>internal</b> <b>standards,</b> <b>the</b> method is independent of the weight of each component eluted thus sampling errors are eliminated.

Of the variables studied, the temperature difference between <b>the</b> modulator and <b>GC</b> oven, <b>the</b> boiling point of the analyte, and <b>the</b> <b>GC</b> column <b>internal</b> diameter produced significant effects on modulator efficiency. ^ The thermal and chromatographic performance characteristics of the modulator were investigated. Direct measurements of the capillary column showed exponential temperature changes during modulator passage. Van 2 ̆ 7 t Hoff plots produced estimates of the free energy of interaction between the analyte and stationary phase on the modulator that were in good agreement with literature values. ^ GC x GC was applied to three separate analyses of petroleum fuels. A quantitative analysis of trace levels of oxygenates and aromatics in groundwater were performed using headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) sampling. The oxygenates studied were methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl butyl ether (EBE). The aromatics studied were the BTEX compounds, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes. Results yielded method detection limits of 360 - 630 parts-per-trillion (v/v). GC x GC resolved all oxygenate and BTEX components from all traditional one-dimensional GC coeluters present in standard gasoline samples. ^ Quantitation of BTEX and all heavier aromatic compounds in finished gasoline was performed. The target aromatic species were resolved from other compound classes. Structurally related aromatics were grouped in a manner that facilitated identification and integration. Quantitation produced results directly comparable with more complicated standard methods. ^ An oil spill source identification case from the U. S. Coast Guard 2 ̆ 7 s Marine Safety Laboratories (MSL) was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by GC x GC and compared with standard methods employed by MSL.

30|$|In Figure  2, the {{presence}} of diacylglycerol (DG) with higher retention times, 40 to 60 min, can also be seen, which do not allow its integration into <b>the</b> <b>GC</b> chromatogram, {{so that it is}} necessary to determine DG together and TG by using an <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> such as cetane here employed. It should be noted that the differences in RT values between MG and DG are much higher than those existing between MG and FAME or FAEE, such as it is expected by the differences between their corresponding molecular weights. At the same time, it is clear that the FAMEs, FAEEs, and MGs display somewhat higher RT values than cetane, but within the molecular weight range, which allows considering similar chemical-physical properties between the FAE and the hydrocarbons that constitute diesel.|$|R
30|$|The polysaccharides were {{calculated}} {{based on the}} amount of the neutral sugar monomers released by total hydrolysis, after derivatisation as alditol acetates and separation by gas chromatography with a method adapted from Tappi 249  cm- 00. The hydrolysed carbohydrates were derivatized as alditol acetates and separated by GC (HP 7820 A gas chromatograph) equipped with a FID detector, using helium as carrier gas (1  ml/min) and a fused silica capillary column BPX 70 (30  m ×  0.32  mm, i.d. ×  0.20  μm film thickness). The column program temperature was 225 – 250  °C, with 5  °C/min heating gradient, and the temperature of injector and detector was 250  °C. For quantitative analysis <b>the</b> <b>GC</b> was calibrated with pure reference compounds and inositol was used as an <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> in each run.|$|R
40|$|Growing {{interest}} {{in the ability to}} conduct quantitative assays for small molecules by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) has been the driving force for several recent studies. This present work includes the investigation of <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> for these analyses using a high-repetition rate MALDI triple quadrupole instrument. Certain physicochemical properties are assessed for predicting possible matches for <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> for different small molecules. The importance of similar molecular weight of an <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> to its analyte is seen through experiments with a series of acylcarnitines, having a fixed charge site and growing alkyl chain length. Both acetyl- and hexanoyl-carnitine were systematically assessed with several other acylcarnitine compounds as <b>internal</b> <b>standards.</b> The results clearly demonstrate that closely matched molecular weights between analyte and <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> are essential for acceptable quantitation results. Using -cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid as the organic matrix, the similarities between analyte and <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> remain the most important parameter and not necessarily their even distribution within the solid sample spot. Several 4 -quinolone antibiotics as well as a diverse group of pharmaceutical drugs were tested as <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> for the 4 -quinolone, ciprofloxacin. Quantitative results were shown using the solution-phase properties, log D and pKa, of these molecules. Their distribution coefficients, log D, are demonstrated as a fundamental parameter for similar crystallization patterns of analyte and <b>internal</b> <b>standard.</b> In the end, it was also possible to quantify ciprofloxacin using a drug from a different compound class, namely quinidine, having a similar log D value as the analyte.
