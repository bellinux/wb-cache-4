40|$|Joint <b>tenancy</b> and <b>tenancy</b> <b>in</b> common are for {{all intents}} and {{purposes}} the only means of co-ownership of real or personal property in Western Australia. Joint tenants hold the whole property jointly and nothing separately. Tenants in common, on the other hand, have a distinct share in the property. There are two essential features that distinguish a joint tenancy from a <b>tenancy</b> <b>in</b> common. The first feature is the right of survivorship: upon the death of one joint tenant his interest in the property is extinguished and the interest of the surviving joint tenants is correspondingly enlarged. Upon the death of a tenant in common his interest in the property passes under his will or intestacy. The second feature is the presence of four unities: in order for there to be a joint tenancy there must be unity of title, interest, time and possession. Although the four unities may be present <b>in</b> a <b>tenancy</b> <b>in</b> common, the only unity which is essential is unity of possession...|$|R

50|$|A {{concurrent}} estate or co-tenancy {{is a concept}} in property law which describes the various ways in which property is owned {{by more than one}} person at a time. If more than one person owns the same property, they are referred to as co-owners. If more than one person leases the same property, they are called co-tenants or joint tenants. Most common law jurisdictions recognize <b>tenancies</b> <b>in</b> common and joint tenancies, and some also recognize tenancies by the entirety. Many jurisdictions refer to a joint tenancy as a joint tenancy with right of survivorship, and a few U.S. states treat the phrase joint tenancy as synonymous with a <b>tenancy</b> <b>in</b> common.|$|R

40|$|When {{a person}} dies without a will, the State {{effectively}} supplies a will by default via {{the laws of}} intestate succession. The laws of intestate succession may trigger a transfer of real property – “Land, and generally whatever is erected or growing upon or affixed to land ” (Black 1983, 636) – {{in the form of}} <b>tenancy</b> <b>in</b> common. <b>Tenancy</b> <b>in</b> common is a form of joint ownership in which cotenants have an undivided partial interest in property. If a cotenant dies intestate, any interest in property passes to his heirs (Black). An undivided partial interest allows a cotenant (subject to the rights of other cotenants) to use the entire property as if it were his own regardless of the size of his partial interest <b>in</b> the property. <b>Tenancy</b> <b>in</b> common that is the result of an inter-generational transfer of property through intestate succession {{is often referred to as}} heir property (Mitchell 2001). <b>Tenancy</b> <b>in</b> common is a legal form of real property and is not necessarily the result of the laws of intestate succession. Some people choose to hold property as tenants in common. Some purposefully will their property to their heirs as tenants in common. In this paper, I use the term heir property to refer to property that is held <b>in</b> <b>tenancy</b> <b>in</b> common as a result of the laws of intestate succession. My focus on intestate succession results in part from the fact that poor people are more likely than others to die without a valid will (AARP 2000). Hence, any economic consequences associated with the laws of intestate succession will be of greater significance to low income people and the regions where they live. The prevalence of poverty is not evenly distributed across rural America. Pockets of poverty persist. The Appalachian Region, Indian Reservations and the Ozarks are notable rural examples. Since intestate succession may be endemic to these areas, it is important to further examine its influence on property ownership and any subsequent economic consequences...|$|R
