The additional costs, which are modest, can be quantified.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal faced Manchester United at Old Trafford on 7 December 2002; {{the home}} team had beaten title challengers Liverpool the {{previous}} weekend. Manchester United opened the scoring in the 21st minute – a poor clearance by Cygan allowed Juan Sebastián Verón to score. Arsenal goalkeeper Rami Shaaban was substituted {{before the start of}} the second half, having pulled a thigh muscle. He was replaced by Stuart Taylor, who was helpless to prevent Paul Scholes from scoring a second goal, 15 minutes before the final whistle. A 1–1 draw at Tottenham Hotspur was followed by a win against Middlesbrough; a goal apiece from Campbell and Pirès meant Arsenal were top of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>on</b> Christmas. On Boxing Day, Arsenal came from a goal down to beat West Brom 2–1; in doing so, they extended their lead at the top to four points. Three days later, Arsenal's lead was increased to five points, having drawn with Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Dickov {{opted to}} build a {{youthful}} side and made controversial decisions {{at the start of}} the season to offload 2009–10 player of the year and club captain Sean Gregan as well as top scorer Paweł Abbott amongst other first team players. The team went into the New Year in ninth position, with games in hand on the teams above them, and being unbeaten at home in the league. Results in the second half of the season were less consistent and the team finished the season in the bottom half of <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>On</b> 6 May 2011 Dickov announced that he would make only his second appearance of the season for the first team in the final match of the season, and would then end his playing career to concentrate on management. He then came on as a 77th-minute substitute the following day against Milton Keynes Dons.|$|E

5|$|Mills' signings for 2012–13 {{proved to}} be less {{influential}} than his signings the previous summer, {{a number of new}} players being left out of the team with little playing time. York were in midtable for most {{of the first half of}} the season, and his signings in the winter transfer window had little impact on the team. Having been 14th in <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>on</b> 1 January 2013, York went on a run of 11 matches without a win, and this left the team four points above the relegation zone in 18th place. Mills was dismissed by York on 2 March 2013, an hour after the last of these matches, a 2–0 defeat at home to Bradford City.|$|E

Above this mask may very well be the raven of Apollo. On {{the left side of the}} table, a goat is seen resting on the ground, surrounded by the symbols of the cult. Finally, a wicker basket can be found to the right of the table, out of which a snake emerges; this basket motif is often found in Dionysian artwork, and seemingly was an object of great importance to the religion.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} from Raw was a Last Man Standing match, where {{the goal is}} to {{incapacitate}} the opponent long enough for a 10-count. In his third match of the night, Triple H defended his WWE Championship against Randy Orton. Both men fought extensively outside the ring, both taking advantage of the match stipulations, where there are no countouts or disqualifications. At one point, both men were positioned on top of one of the broadcast tables, where Orton attempted an RKO on Triple H, who countered the move and sent Orton through another of the broadcast tables. Triple H followed this by striking Orton with the steel steps. The men returned to the ring, and Orton performed a DDT and an RKO on Triple H, both onto a steel chair. The competitors returned to the outside of the ring again, and Triple H struck Orton with a chair. They returned {{to the top of the}} broadcast table, and Triple H attempted a Pedigree through <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>on</b> Orton, who countered into an RKO onto the table. The referee began a count and reached ten before Triple H could rise; in result, Orton won the match and subsequently regained the WWE Championship.|$|E

5|$|The TNA World Tag Team Championship was defended in a Four Way Tag Team Monster's Ball {{match with}} Steve McMichael as Special Guest Referee {{in the fifth}} contest. Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode) defended the title against the team of Abyss and Matt Morgan, The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide), and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). Jacqueline {{accompanied}} Beer Money, Inc. to the ring. The duration of the bout was 20 minutes and 20 seconds. This bout was contested under no count-outs and no disqualification rules with weapons legal {{and the only way}} to win was for a competitor to either pin or make another wrestler submit. The match started off with Hernandez jumping over the top rope onto Roode and Storm. Several competitors bled during the contest, such as Devon and Abyss, who was cut open by a cheese grater by Ray. McMichael was directly involved in the match several times. The first being an altercation with Beer Money, Inc., resulting in McMichael attacking Roode. Another time was near the end of the contest when Jacqueline interrupted a pin attempt by Homicide on Storm, with McMichael spanking her in retaliation. The last time was when he aided Hernandez in opening a tied bag of thumbtacks. Johnny Devine interfered in the encounter when Team 3D were assaulting Abyss with various weapons, such as a staple gun. Devine hit Abyss with a kendo stick from behind and helped Devon set up a table on the floor next to the stage. Ray and Devon then sprayed the table with lighter fluid. Devine lit <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>on</b> fire before Ray and Devon slammed Abyss through the flaming table off of the stage. The match ended when Team 3D forced Hernandez through a table covered in thumbtacks with their signature 3D tag team maneuver, before Storm spat beer in Devon's eyes and Roode covered Hernandez for the pinfall to retain the TNA World Tag Team Championship.|$|E
