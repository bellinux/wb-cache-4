50|$|The MBT-70 was {{designed}} {{with a low}} silhouette, unlike the M60, one of the tallest tanks ever built. The MBT-70 ended up very low, just over 6 ft from the floor to the turret-roof. This left no room in the hull for the driver, {{who had to be}} moved into the turret. He was located in a cupola which was geared to rotate so that he was always looking in the same direction even if the <b>turret</b> <b>turned.</b> He could also spin the cupola around, so the tank could be driven backwards at full speed.|$|R
50|$|It {{was assumed}} that the {{bearings}} upon which a usual <b>turret</b> <b>turned</b> would not survive {{the shock of the}} impact consequent upon the use of the ram against an enemy ship. Her single 12 in gun was therefore positioned in a fixed cupola perforated by four firing-ports through which the gun could be discharged. None of these ports allowed the gun to be fired straight ahead, where a potential ramming target would be situated. It was therefore only possible to engage these targets with the gun if the ramming attack missed.|$|R

5|$|Hulls of twin-turreted T-26s were {{assembled}} using armoured plates {{riveted to}} a frame from metal angles. Some tanks, produced in 1931, had sealing zinc shims at the hull bottom between armoured plates for fording water obstacles. After problems with rain entering the engine compartment, a special cover was installed over an air outlet window after March 1932. Some T-26s produced {{at the end}} of 1932–1933 had a riveted and welded hull. The T-26 mod. 1931 had two cylindrical turrets mounted on ball bearings; each <b>turret</b> <b>turned</b> independently through 240°. Both turrets could provide common fire in front and rear arcs of fire (100° each). The disadvantage of such a configuration was that not all of the tank's firepower could be used at once on the same side. Four turret modifications existed, and they were mounted on tanks in different combinations (for instance, a tank with a riveted hull could have riveted and welded turrets).|$|R

50|$|A {{military}} train {{coming from}} Reitzenhain suffered an accident on 30 May 1945 in Hüttengrund, a valley east of Marienberg. The train left Reitzenhain around 22:00 and was hauled by a Class 52 steam locomotive. It transported a tank unit of Red Army. Because of a too high load, the train crew and the station crew initially {{refused to let}} the train depart and requested a second locomotive for braking purposes. The Soviet commander, however, threatened the railway personnel and forced the departure. A safety stop in Gelobtland was intended, but proved impossible due to insufficient braking power. Instead, {{the speed of the}} train increased in the following steep section. One tank wedged in a cutting in Hüttengrund, after centrifugal forces had made its <b>turret</b> <b>turn,</b> and its gun had touched the rocky wall. Five flatcars detached from the train, and the load of all following cars was thrown off. The remainder of the train could only be stopped in Pockau. The number of victims is not exactly known; one source states 18 dead. The train crew, the Reitzenhain station master and another Reichsbahn official were made responsible for the accident and were detained. The station master was summarily shot one month later.

40|$|The {{present report}} {{presents}} a fatigue life prediction method for large roller bearings {{applied in the}} <b>turret</b> <b>turn</b> table for large loading buoy units. The contact points between wheel and rail in these bearings are subjected to a multi-axial fluctuating stress situation and both surface wear and fatigue cracking may occur. A methodology based on the Dang Van fatigue criterion is adopted. The criterion {{is based on an}} equivalent stress defined as a combination of the fluctuation of the shear stress from its mean value at a critical plane and the associated hydrostatic stress at the given time. The present work is supporting the theoretical model by extensive laboratory testing. Both full scale testing of wheel on rail and small scale testing for characterizing the steel material are carried out. An experimental program was carried out with the high strength stainless steel S 165 M. The Dang Van stress concept is applied in combination with the Random Fatigue Limit Method (RFLM) for life data analyses. This approach gives the opportunity to include both finite lives and the run-outs in a rational manner without any presumption of the existence of a fatigue limit in advance of the data. This gives a non-linear S-N curve for a log-log scale in the very high cycle regime close to the fatigue limit. It is demonstrated how the scatter in fatigue limit decreases when the Dang Van stress concept is applied and that the fatigue limit is occurring beyond 107 cycle...|$|R

5000|$|The turret {{was first}} used in naval combat on the USS Monitor in 1862, with a type of turret {{designed}} by the Swedish engineer John Ericsson. A competing turret design was proposed by the British inventor Cowper Coles with a prototype of this installed on HMS Trusty in 1861 for testing and evaluation purposes. Ericsson's <b>turret</b> <b>turned</b> on a central spindle, and Coles's turned on a ring of bearings. Turrets offered the maximum arc of fire from the guns, but there were significant problems with their use in the 1860s. The fire arc of a turret would be considerably limited by masts and rigging, so they were unsuited to use on the earlier ocean-going ironclads. The second problem was that turrets were extremely heavy. Ericsson was able to offer the heaviest possible turret (guns and armor protection) by deliberately designing a ship with very low freeboard. The weight thus saved from having a high broadside above the waterline was diverted to actual guns and armor. Low freeboard, however, also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity for coal storage—and therefore range of the vessel. In many respects, the turreted, low-freeboard Monitor and the broadside sailer HMS Warrior represented two opposite extremes in what an 'Ironclad' was all about. The most dramatic attempt to compromise these two extremes, or 'squaring this circle', was designed by Captain Cowper Phipps Coles: HMS Captain, a dangerously low freeboard turret ship which nevertheless carried a full rig of sail, and which subsequently capsized not long after her launch in 1870. Her half-sister [...] was restricted to firing from her turrets only on the port and starboard beams.

50|$|The {{games in}} the BioShock series are first-person shooter; {{considered}} the spiritual successor to System Shock 2, which many of the developers were previously involved with through Irrational Games. While specific mechanics differ between all three games, they share a common theme of having the player {{use a combination of}} physical weapons such as guns and melee weapons, superhuman powers and passive abilities granted by genetic alterations (plasmids in the first two games, vigors in Infinite), and features of the game environment to strategically work their way through enemy forces and tactical situations. These weapons and powers can be used in various combinations to aid in defeating foes; for example, electrocuting an enemy makes them prone to being knocked out from a subsequent melee attack. Scenarios in the game often feature multiple approaches that the player can take, such as opting to avoid enemies through stealth and deception, hacking a security <b>turret</b> to <b>turn</b> against enemy forces, or directly engaging in combat. The player is able to customize their weapons and genetic enhancements for the style of play they prefer. In addition to collecting new weapons and genetic modifications, the player gains ammunition, mana-like power required to engage the genetic modifications (EVE in the first two games, Salt in Infinite), restorative items, scrap items used to craft new materials, and in-game money to buy various improvements at vending machines throughout the game.|$|R

The relation between the cutting force ratio and the straightness is investigated under the various cutting conditions, which are the cutting speed, the feed rate, the depth of cut, the tool nose radius and the rake angle. The experimentally obtained results showed that the straightness can be improved with an increase in cutting speed, tool nose radius and rake angle. The relation between the dynamic cutting force and straightness profile can be proved by checking the frequency of the cutting force in frequency domain {{with the use of the}} Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is the same as the straightness profile. Hence, the cutting force ratio can be used to predict the straightness during the cutting regardless of the cutting conditions. The cutting force ratio is proposed to predict the straightness during turning process by employing the exponential function for the sake of straightness. The multiple regression analysis has been utilized to calculate the regression coefficients of the in-process prediction of straightness model by using the least square method at 95 % confident level. It has been proved by the cutting tests that the in-process straightness can be predicted during the cutting within ± 10 % measured straightness with the high accuracy of 91. 85 %...|$|R
