5|$|While {{his first}} tournament as yokozuna {{ended in a}} disappointing 10–5 record, he won a further twenty-three tournaments. Combined with his two yūshō as an ōzeki, he had twenty-five career championships in the top division. <b>This</b> <b>puts</b> him in fourth place on the all-time list, behind only Hakuhō, Taihō, and Chiyonofuji.|$|E
5|$|Ikata {{is a small}} town, with a {{population}} of 10,637 as of March 31, 2014. The total land area of the town is 94.37km2, making the population density 113 persons per km2. However, much of the land on the peninsula is quite mountainous and not suited for development; the population density of the individual settlements, which are squeezed into the small bay areas {{in the foothills of the}} mountains, is much higher. Extrapolating from data based on the most recent land survey, only 3.21% of the town's land is inhabited; <b>this</b> <b>puts</b> the population density at a much higher 3,510 persons/kilometer-squared.|$|E
5|$|On June 9, 2015, Posey caught rookie Chris Heston's no-hitter {{against the}} New York Mets at Citi Field, {{including}} the final out, a strikeout. It marks the seventeenth no-hitter in Giants franchise history. This {{was the third}} no-hitter during which Posey played catcher and the fourth overall, as he started at first base in Tim Lincecum's second career no-hitter. <b>This</b> <b>puts</b> him one behind the record for no-hitters caught, held by the Philadelphia Phillies' Carlos Ruiz and the Boston Red Sox' Jason Varitek.|$|E

5|$|On {{the train}} Sameer meets Suraj Prakash (Satish Shah), who makes him {{think that he}} is a thief by asking him where he keeps {{important}} things (like money) in his luggage. Sameer stays awake all night to avoid being robbed, while Suraj sleeps after conning Sameer into guarding his luggage. Suraj admits this to Sameer the next morning at the station. Sameer learns that Suraj is a security guard at his resort, and puts him on night guard duty for three months. <b>This</b> <b>puts</b> a crimp in Suraj's marriage and, although he apologises, Sameer is adamant.|$|E
5|$|Rowson cites as {{an example}} of the last {{phenomenon}} the well-regarded Zaitsev Variation of the Ruy Lopez. After 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 0-0 8.c3 d6 9.h3 Bb7 10.d4 Re8 (initiating the Zaitsev Variation), White can repeat moves once with 11.Ng5 Rf8 12.Nf3. <b>This</b> <b>puts</b> Black in an awkward situation, since he must either (a) insist on the Zaitsev with 12...Re8, which allows White to choose whether to draw by threefold repetition with 13.Ng5 Rf8 14.Nf3, or play on with a different move, or (b) play a different (and possibly inferior) variation by playing something other than 12...Re8.|$|E
5|$|GO {{has always}} owned its {{locomotives}} and coaches, but its trackage {{used to be}} owned entirely by Canada's two major commercial railways: the large majority by the Canadian National Railway (CN) and the remainder (the current Milton line) by Canadian Pacific Railway (CP). In 1988, as part of expanding service east of Pickering, GO built its first section of self-owned purpose-built trackage. From 1998 until 2009, GO owned only 6% of the railway trackage on which it operated. Starting in 2009, Metrolinx incrementally acquired further trackage from the two commercial railways {{in order to improve}} GO service. As of 2014, Metrolinx has complete ownership of the Barrie, Stouffville and Lakeshore East lines, and a majority of the Lakeshore West, Richmond Hill, and Kitchener lines. CP still owns most of the Milton line. <b>This</b> <b>puts</b> Metrolinx ownership at 80% of GO Transit's trackage.|$|E

5|$|Gliese 876 b is in a 1:2:4 Laplace {{resonance}} {{with the}} inner planet Gliese 876 c {{and the outer}} planet Gliese 876 e: {{in the time it}} takes planet e to complete one orbit, planet b completes two and planet c completes four. This is the second known example of a Laplace resonance, the first being Jupiter's moons Io, Europa and Ganymede. As a result, the orbital elements of the planets change fairly rapidly as they dynamically interact with one another. The planet's orbit has a low eccentricity, similar to the planets in the Solar System. The semimajor axis of the orbit is only 0.208 AU, less than that of Mercury in the Solar System. However Gliese 876 is such a faint star that <b>this</b> <b>puts</b> it in the outer part of the habitable zone.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, if {{the center of}} mass height is behind or below the line, such as on most tandem {{bicycles}} or long-wheel-base recumbent bicycles, as well as cars, it is less likely that the front wheel can generate enough braking force to flip the bike. This means they can decelerate up to nearly the limit of adhesion of the tires to the road, which could reach 0.8 g if the coefficient of friction is 0.8, which is 40% more than an upright bicycle under even the best conditions. Bicycling Science author David Gordon Wilson points out that <b>this</b> <b>puts</b> upright bicyclists at particular risk of causing a rear-end collision if they tailgate cars.|$|E
5|$|The Taken are {{protected}} by a shield of darkness, initially rendering them impervious to attack; they can only be injured with a firearm after exposure to light, which burns the darkness away. <b>This</b> <b>puts</b> significant emphasis on flashlights in conjunction with conventional weapons, such as a revolver or shotgun. Flashlight beams act as a reticle. The handheld lights Wake can carry can be boosted, which destroys the darkness faster, but also reduces the light's battery level. Besides the conventional shooter gameplay need for reloading ammunition, the player must also insert fresh batteries into the flashlight when they run out, or {{wait for it to}} recharge slowly. The strength of the darkness protecting an enemy can vary among the Taken. The amount of darkness remaining is represented by a corona of light that appears when aiming at an enemy, and a stronger darkness may recharge over time. When a Taken is finally destroyed, it disappears.|$|E

5|$|Posehn had a {{difficult}} time working within the Genesis's output resolution of 320×240. He wanted to show as much of the playing field as possible without losing the details of the sprites; he felt a lack of graphical detail would make them less interesting. Posehn developed a dynamic camera system to help maintain what he felt was the right balance between the size of the field in view {{and the size of the}} game objects. The camera travels on an elliptic curve as the helicopter rotates to change the direction it travels; <b>this</b> <b>puts</b> whatever is in front of the helicopter more in view on screen. Posehn also integrated momentum to the camera movements to smooth transitions. He spent several months working on the physics for the screen and helicopter to ensure realistic movement. Instead of using completely accurate physics, Posehn chose to model movement that he believed players would assume a helicopter would have. He believed players would be put off by physics that didn't match their perceived movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by show runner and {{executive}} producer Shonda Rhimes, while filmmaker Daniel Minahan directed it. Sara Ramirez began receiving star billing in the season premiere, after numerous appearances during the last episodes of the second season. Although the episode was fictionally set in Seattle, Washington, it was filmed in Los Angeles, California. Fisher Plaza, which is the headquarters building for Fisher Communications and Fisher's ABC affiliated Komo radio and television stations for Seattle, is used for some exterior shots of Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, such as air ambulances landing on the Komo Television newscopter's helipad. <b>This</b> <b>puts</b> Seattle Grace conveniently close to the Space Needle, which is {{directly across the street}} from Fisher Plaza, the Seattle Monorail, and other local landmarks. However, the hospital used for most other exterior and many interior shots is not in Seattle, are shot at the VA Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in North Hills, California. Most scenes are primarily filmed in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, at the Prospect Studios, and the set occupies two stages, including the hospital pieces, but some outside scenes are shot at the Warren G. Magnuson Park in Seattle.|$|E

25|$|A hybrid {{design of}} the sled-foot trestle and the post and rail styles can work well.
