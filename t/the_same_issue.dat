5|$|Senator Roberts {{proposed}} legislation {{at the start}} of session regarding the surety bond required for towing carriers in rural areas. SB12-049 would have lowered the surety bond from $50,000 to $10,000 for local entities. The bill was assigned to the Senate Transportation Committee, but was postponed indefinitely after it was introduced. However, after the bill was killed, public upheaval caused Roberts to introduce a new bill, this time in the House, which resolved <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>issue.</b> HB12-1347 passed the second time around with a resounding 98-1 vote.|$|E
5|$|The authors {{discuss the}} broader concept of denial using social science theory, noting its {{occurrence}} appears in society when individuals are frightened or ashamed of their actions. They write that these motivations, when expanded {{from an individual}} to wider society, present themselves {{as a form of}} disease. The book identifies climate change denial itself as a pathology afflicting the culture of the planet. The authors lament that an inverse relationship exists between an increasing scientific consensus regarding climate change, and a simultaneous increase in denial within the greater public about <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E
5|$|A smaller, single-panel oil {{painting}} by Lichtenstein {{around the same}} time, Tex!, has a similar composition, with a plane at the lower left shooting an air-to-air missile at a second plane that is exploding in the upper right, with a word bubble. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>issue</b> of All-American Men of War was the inspiration {{for at least three}} other Lichtenstein paintings, Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!, Brattata and Blam, in addition to Whaam! and Tex! The graphite pencil sketch, Jet Pilot was also from that issue. Several of Lichtenstein's other comics-based works are inspired by stories about Johnny Flying Cloud written by Robert Kanigher and illustrated by Novick, including Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!, Jet Pilot and Von Karp.|$|E

5|$|Experimental {{evidence}} supporting the Watson and Crick model {{was published in}} a series of five articles in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>issue</b> of Nature. Of these, Franklin and Gosling's paper was the first publication of their own X-ray diffraction data and original analysis method that partly supported the Watson and Crick model; this issue also contained an article on DNA structure by Maurice Wilkins and two of his colleagues, whose analysis and in vivo B-DNA X-ray patterns also supported the presence in vivo of the double-helical DNA configurations as proposed by Crick and Watson for their double-helix molecular model of DNA in the prior two pages of Nature. In 1962, after Franklin's death, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins jointly received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Nobel Prizes are awarded only to living recipients. A debate continues about who should receive credit for the discovery.|$|E
5|$|George {{was active}} in {{directing}} British foreign policy during his early reign. In 1717 he contributed {{to the creation of}} the Triple Alliance, an anti-Spanish league composed of Great Britain, France and the United Provinces. In 1718 the Holy Roman Empire was added to the body which became known as the Quadruple Alliance. The subsequent War of the Quadruple Alliance involved <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>issue</b> as the War of the Spanish Succession. The Treaty of Utrecht (1713) had recognised the grandson of King Louis XIV of France, Philip, as the King of Spain on the condition that he gave up his rights to succeed to the French throne. Upon the death of Louis XIV in 1715, however, Philip sought to overturn the treaty.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} discovery, {{separate}} teams, one led by David Charbonneau including Timothy Brown and others, {{and the other}} by Gregory W. Henry, were able to detect a transit of the planet {{across the surface of}} the star making it the first known transiting extrasolar planet. On September 9 and 16, 1999, Charbonneau's team measured a 1.7% drop in HD209458's brightness, which was attributed to the passage of the planet across the star. On November 8, Henry's team observed a partial transit, seeing only the ingress. Initially unsure of their results, the Henry group decided to rush their results to publication after overhearing rumors that Charbonneau had successfully seen an entire transit in September. Papers from both teams were published simultaneously in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>issue</b> of the Astrophysical Journal. Each transit lasts about three hours, during which the planet covers about 1.5% of the star's face.|$|E

5|$|Another of Dannatt's {{priorities}} was {{tackling the}} perception of the British operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as he was concerned the news media and the British public were unaware of the purpose or the intensity of the missions. Disgruntled by increasingly negative coverage, he interrupted a family holiday in Cornwall to fly to Afghanistan in an effort to change the coverage through a series of interviews. During the visit, he managed to meet with his son, Bertie, who was serving in the country with the Grenadier Guards. Later in 2007, Dannatt raised <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>issue</b> in a lecture to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Earlier that year, Dannatt had taken the decision not to allow Prince Harry to serve in Iraq. However, after Dannatt had brokered an understanding with the British press, Harry was able to serve in Afghanistan for three months in late 2007 and early 2008 until the story broke and he was ordered home.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, the District Court granted Apple's {{motion to}} dismiss for lack of Article III {{standing}} and failure to state a claim, but gave the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint, thereby not shutting out the claims permanently. The court ruled that without a showing of legal damages compensable under current law, the plaintiffs had not shown they sustained injury in fact by the defendants' actions. The problem facing the plaintiffs is {{the current state of}} electronic privacy law, the issue being that there is no national privacy law that provides for compensatory damages for breach of privacy, and this is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>issue</b> faced by victims of data breaches, as breaches, per se, sustain no legal damages without a showing of actual and measurable harm such as monetary loss. Under U.S. law as of July 2012, it is only when a data breach results in actual loss as defined by applicable law that compensable damages arise. The case remained on the California court's docket as of July 2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on May 3, 2006, The New York Times addressed the controversy. The paper acknowledged that the mainstream media—itself included—had been criticized for focusing on Bush's act with Bridges while ignoring Colbert's speech. The paper then quoted several passages of Colbert's more substantial criticism {{of the president and}} discussed various reactions to the event. On May 15, The New York Times public editor, Byron Calame, wrote on his blog that more than two hundred readers had written to complain about the exclusion of any mention of Colbert from the paper's initial lengthy article covering the dinner. Calame quoted his deputy bureau chief in Washington, who said that a mention of Colbert in the first article could not have been long enough to do his routine justice. But he also noted that the paper should have printed an in-depth article specifically covering Colbert's speech in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>issue,</b> rather than waiting until days after the fact.|$|E

5|$|The Consultative Committee (similar to the Economic and Social Committee) had between 30 and 50 members equally {{divided between}} producers, workers, {{consumers}} and dealers {{in the coal}} and steel sector. Again, there were no national quotas, and the treaty required representatives of European associations to organise their own democratic procedures. They were to establish rules to make their membership fully representative for democratic organised civil society. Membership were appointed {{for two years and}} were not bound by any mandate or instruction of the organisations which appointed them. The Committee had a plenary assembly, bureau and president. Again, the required democratic procedures were not introduced and nomination of these members remained in the hands of national ministers. The High Authority was obliged to consult the Committee in certain cases where it was appropriate and to keep it informed. The Consultative Committee remained separate (despite the merger of the other institutions) until 2002, when the Treaty expired and its duties were taken over by the Economic and Social Committee (ESC). Despite its independence, the Committee did cooperate with the ESC when they were consulted on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E
5|$|With ten laps of {{the race}} remaining, Rossi {{reported}} to his team over the radio that his front tyres were degrading, while Vandoorne was experiencing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>issue.</b> King quickly closed the gap to Yelloly and overtook him for ninth place on the 32nd lap. Vandoorne held the lead for the remainder {{of the race}} and crossed the start/finish line after 40 laps to secure his third consecutive GP2 feature race victory of the season, and his seventh in the series. He finished six seconds ahead of Rossi who reduced his speed, with Leal third on the road, but was issued with a ten-second time penalty upon being judged by the stewards to have been unsafely released from his pit stall. As a result, Canamasas inherited third-place, ahead of Pic and Sirotkin. Leal, Stanaway, Maricello, King and Yelloly rounded out the top-ten points-scoring finishers. Binder, de Jong, Lynn, Gasly and Vișoiu were the next five finishers, with Haryanto, Berthon, Nato, Stöckinger, Cecotto, Negrão and Amberg the last of the classified finishers.|$|E
