500|$|After {{their first}} couple of seasons in New York City, team {{ownership}} infrequently invested in new players. The ownership group of Farrell and Devery spent their money on personal pursuits such as gambling, leaving them with little to put into the team. New York's star player, Chase, consorted frequently with gamblers. Author Jim Reisler dubbed him [...] "the most crooked player to ever play the game" [...] because of reports that he took part in game fixing. The club also had difficulty drawing fans to Hilltop Park. Appel wrote that [...] "maybe the best <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say about the ballpark was that it never burned down."

[...] In June 2009, Silberling confirmed he still talked about the project with Handler, and suggested the sequel be a stop motion film because the lead actors have grown too old. [...] "In an odd way, the best <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do is actually have Lemony Snicket say to the audience, 'Okay, we pawned the first film off as a mere dramatization with actors.

500|$|Ice later {{developed}} {{a friendship with}} producer Ross Robinson, who had become known for producing music by Deftones, Korn, Limp Bizkit and Sepultura. Robinson and Ice shared an interest in motocross racing. Monte Lipman hoped that Robinson would produce a new Vanilla Ice album. According to Robinson, others had attempted to discourage him from working with Ice, saying it might hurt his reputation. Rather than being dissuaded, their fear encouraged Robinson who agreed to work with Ice. In an interview, Robinson stated [...] "It's the most punk-rock <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do." [...] Despite not being happy with his old image, Winkle stated that {{he never had a}} problem with his older music. Ice decided against changing his stage name to something else, as he felt no need to run from his past, despite being uneasy with some of it and started performing again, booking a hundred shows a year.|$|E

In his autobiography White Rat his first big league manager, future Baseball Hall of Famer [...] Whitey Herzog stated that he was often forced to leave Clyde in the game much longer than usual because fans {{wanted to see the}} 18-year-old [...] "phenom" [...] pitch. It led to Clyde's arm burning out at an early age, Herzog argued. In a 2003 interview with The New York Times, Herzog criticized Bob Short, stating that [...] "(Short) sure wasn't going to send him down without getting some people in the ballpark to see him.

The author wrote, [...] "There are times when the BLT just tastes right, primal and true, the best <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> ever eat. The play of the salt and acid, the silk of the tomato against the salt crunch of the bacon ... It is sheer delight."

Jordan writes that to make the best sandwich, one should select the finest ingredients. She recommends shopping at farmers' markets for fresh tomatoes, a butcher for choice bacon, and a bakery for fresh bread. The author recommends mayonnaise brands Hellmann's and Best Foods, and Niman bacon from California. Jordan writes, [...] "For lettuce, remove the first outer leaf and then use only the next three layers. Further in, iceberg lettuce gets a little cabbagey." ...|$|E
500|$|The group's {{solution}} was to fly {{back and forth between}} Dublin and their concert destinations for about ten days to finish recording and mixing at night and during their off-days. Clayton called the process [...] "about the craziest <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do to yourself", while Mullen said of it, [...] "It was mad, but it was mad good, as opposed to mad bad." [...] McGuinness later said the band had nearly wrecked themselves in the process. The group simultaneously used three separate rooms at Windmill Lane to mix, overdub, and edit. Adams said the hectic approach meant [...] "there was never anybody sitting around waiting or doing nothing". Flood called the period one of [...] "absolute lunacy". Eschewing console automation, the engineers adopted a [...] "live performance" [...] attitude to mixing, based on past experiences with Lanois. The band and production crew sat in on the mixing and offered encouragement, creating, as Adams put it, [...] "a kind of cheerleader thing. It all induces a nervous energy in you and creates a lot of pressure, and gives the whole thing a performance feel." [...] Recording concluded on 14 May 1993.|$|E
500|$|The stage play Being Sellers premiered in Australia in 1998, {{three years}} after the release of the {{biography}} by Roger Lewis, The Life and Death of Peter Sellers. [...] In 2004, the book was turned into an HBO film with the same title, starring Geoffrey Rush. The play later transferred to New York in December 2010. The Belfast Telegraph notes how the film captured Sellers's [...] "life of drugs, drink, fast cars and lots and lots of beautiful women". Although the film was widely praised by critics, both Lord Snowdon and Britt Ekland were highly critical of the film and the enactment of Sellers; Ekland believed that the film left the audiences with the wrong idea of her former husband, saying [...] "the film leaves you with the impression that Peter Sellers was essentially a likeable man when in reality he was a monster. He may have been a brilliant actor, but as a human being he had no saving graces at all". Snowdon disagreed with Ekland's verdict, and with the film, and stated that Sellers [...] "had a light touch, a sense of humour, I can't bear to see him portrayed as somebody who was apparently without either... The man on the screen is charmless, humourless and boring—the one <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> never say about Peter." ...|$|E

500|$|This simple tactic proved unstoppable. Soon, he had {{surpassed the}} 50-point barrier, causing arena speaker Dave Zinkoff {{to fire up}} the {{previously}} sleepy crowd. Chamberlain also kept his cool despite getting perpetually triple and quadruple-teamed by the Knicks, who did not shy away from hard fouls to distract the center. McGuire was irate and demanded that the referees call more fouls, but Chamberlain could not be stopped. He scored another 28 points to lift his Warriors to a commanding 125–106 lead {{by the end of}} the third quarter. His own total stood at 69, nine shy of his previous scoring record. The Knicks' third center, Dave Budd, who alternated with the foul-troubled Imhoff at pivot, later stated that resistance was futile: [...] "You couldn't play [...] conventionally because he was so big. The only <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> attempt to do was either front him, and in that case they'd try to lob it in to him, or beat him down the floor and set up where he wanted to get and force him out a couple of extra steps.

[...] Chamberlain now realized he could break his own 73-point scoring record (for a regulation 48-minute game) or his record 78 points, set in triple overtime.|$|E

Influenced by the tour's themes of technology and mass media, Zooropa was an even greater departure in style from their earlier recordings than Achtung Baby was, incorporating further dance music influences and electronic effects into their sound. A number of songs from the album were incorporated into the subsequent [...] "Zooropa" [...] and [...] "Zoomerang" [...] legs, most frequently [...] "Numb" [...] and [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)".
