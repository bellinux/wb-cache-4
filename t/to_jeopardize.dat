5|$|The Aid and Rescue Committee's {{first meeting}} with Eichmann was on 25 April 1944. At {{around the same time}} Kastner is {{believed}} to have received a copy of the Vrba–Wetzler report, possibly in German. Vrba alleged that Kastner failed to distribute the report in order not <b>to</b> <b>jeopardize</b> the Eichmann deal, but acted on it privately by arranging for 1,684 Hungarian Jews to escape to Switzerland on the Kastner train, which left Budapest on 30 June 1944.|$|E
5|$|By 1962, Congress {{had passed}} {{legislation}} to deny financial aid grants to Yugoslavia, {{to withdraw the}} sale of spare parts for Yugoslav warplanes, and to revoke the country's most favored nation status. Kennan strongly protested the legislation, arguing that it would only result in a straining of relations between Yugoslavia and the U.S. Kennan came to Washington {{during the summer of}} 1962 to lobby against the legislation but was unable to elicit a change from Congress. President Kennedy endorsed Kennan privately but remained noncommittal publicly, as he did not want <b>to</b> <b>jeopardize</b> his slim majority support in Congress on a potentially contentious issue. With U.S.–Yugoslav relations getting progressively worse, Kennan tendered his resignation as ambassador during late July 1963.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, civil {{engineer}} Virgil Bogue presented {{a comprehensive plan}} {{for the city of}} Seattle, including an elevated rapid transit line running southeast from King Street Station through Chinatown towards the Rainier Valley. The plan was, however, rejected by voters on March 5, 1912, leaving it unimplemented. In 1957, Seattle City Engineer M. O. Anderberg and the Seattle Transit Commission proposed a rapid transit system utilizing the right-of-way cleared for Interstate 5 between Everett and Tacoma. The rapid transit line would travel through downtown Seattle in a tunnel under 5th Avenue, with one of its two stations at South Jackson Street at the site of Union Station. The proposal included redevelopment of Union Station into a multi-level transportation hub, with a bus terminal for intercity and suburban buses, a public parking garage, and a rooftop heliport. The proposal was rejected by the federal government, not wanting <b>to</b> <b>jeopardize</b> freeway construction, and was ultimately shelved.|$|E

5|$|Kastner's {{reasons for}} not making the {{document}} public are unknown. Vrba believed {{until the end of}} his life that Kastner withheld it in order not <b>to</b> <b>jeopardize</b> negotiations between the Aid and Rescue Committee and Adolf Eichmann, the SS officer in charge of the transport of Jews out of Hungary. Shortly after Vrba arrived in Slovakia from Auschwitz in April 1944, Eichmann proposed to the Aid and Rescue Committee in Budapest (specifically to Kastner, Joel Brand and Hansi Brand) that the Nazis trade up to one million Hungarian Jews for 10,000 trucks and other goods from the Western Allies. The proposal came to nothing, but in exchange for money and other goods Kastner did obtain safe passage to Switzerland for 1,684 Jews on what became known as the Kastner train. Vrba believed that Kastner suppressed the Vrba–Wetzler report in order not to damage those negotiations with the SS.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian {{position}} on any offensive move {{was made clear}} by Leopold III. As {{far as he was}} concerned, the Belgian Army could not conduct offensive operations as it lacked tanks and aircraft; it existed solely for defence. The King also made clear that in the rapidly shrinking area of Belgium still free, there was only enough food for two weeks. Leopold did not expect the BEF <b>to</b> <b>jeopardize</b> its own position in order to keep contact with the Belgian Army, but he warned the British that if it persisted with the southern offensive the Belgians would be overstretched and their army would collapse. King Leopold suggested the best recourse was to establish a beach-head covering Dunkirk and the Belgian channel ports. The will of the CIGS won out. Gort committed just two infantry battalions and the only armoured battalion in the BEF to the attack, which despite some initial tactical success, failed to break the German defensive line at the Battle of Arras on 21 May.|$|E
5|$|The Finns {{had many}} reasons {{to turn down the}} Soviet proposals. Finland had started {{negotiations}} for a military co-operation with Sweden, and the Finns had great hopes for the joint Finnish–Swedish defense for the Ålands islands and did not want <b>to</b> <b>jeopardize</b> these negotiations. In addition, the violent collectivization, purges, show trials and executions in Stalin's Soviet Union had given the country a bad reputation. Furthermore, most of the Finnish Communist leadership in the Soviet Union was executed during the Great Purge. The Soviet Union did not therefore seem to be a reliable contracting party. The Soviet envoys sent to negotiate with Finns were officially of relatively low rank, but as Väinö Tanner put it later, the Finns assumed rightly that they represented of some higher organ of State, probably the Soviet secret police NKVD.|$|E

5|$|Kim Possible {{takes place}} {{primarily}} within the fictional United States town of Middleton, {{and focuses on}} the life and adventures of teenager Kim Possible. She is an accomplished high school student and cheerleader who fights crime on a regular basis, assisted by her best friend and sidekick, Ron Stoppable, and Rufus, his pet naked mole rat. Ron's personal fears, insecurities and clumsiness sometimes have a tendency <b>to</b> <b>jeopardize</b> {{the success of their}} own missions. Kim and Ron are aided remotely by Wade, a 10 year-old computer genius who seldom leaves his bedroom and communicates with the duo via device he invented himself known as a Kimmunicator. Together, the foursome is known as Team Possible. The majority of Kim's missions involve her traveling to various destinations around the world to rescue citizens from harm and battle a variety of enemies and villains, the most frequent of whom are Dr. Drakken, a mad scientist constantly plotting world domination, and his superpowered sidekick Shego, who possesses the ability to generate powerful energy blasts and emit them from her hands, making her the heroine's most dangerous opponent. Not yet of age to drive herself to most of her missions, Kim often relies on favors from various people and friends she has assisted in the past for transportation.|$|E

30|$|Although the {{damaging}} {{effect of}} SMFP compound has been substantiated to a varied extent {{but to the}} best of the authors’ knowledge the effect has not yet been individualised to concentration and purity of DNA profile. This therefore, appeals to matters related to law-suit through forensic DNA where concentration and purity is demanded at all time (Hedman et al. 2010; Khare et al. 2014; National Research Council 2011; Olson and Morrow 2012; Oxford Gene Technology 2011). This interrogated intactness of such analysed DNA sample results in ascertained profile due to absence, insufficiency, degraded or inhibited state (Leary 2012).

25|$|After a {{stopover}} {{of several}} weeks at the minor port of Nossi-Bé, Madagascar, {{that had been}} reluctantly allowed by neutral France in order not <b>to</b> <b>jeopardize</b> its relations with its Russian ally, the Russian Baltic fleet proceeded to Cam Ranh Bay in French Indochina passing on {{its way through the}} Singapore Strait between 7 and 10 April 1905. The fleet finally reached the Sea of Japan in May 1905. The logistics of such an undertaking in the age of coal power was astounding. The squadron required approximately 500,000tons of coal to complete the journey, yet by international law, it was not allowed to coal at neutral ports, forcing the Russian authorities to acquire a large fleet of colliers to supply the fleet at sea. The weight of the ships' stores needed for such a long journey was to be another major problem.|$|E

25|$|Back in Western Xia, Yinchuan lay besieged {{for about}} six months, and Genghis, himself busy {{directing}} a siege of Longde, sent Chagaan to negotiate terms. Chagaan reported that the emperor agreed to capitulate, but wanted a month to prepare suitable gifts. Genghis agreed, though secretly planned to kill the emperor. During the peace negotiations, Genghis continued his military operations around the Liupan mountains near Guyuan, rejected an offer of peace from the Jin, and prepared to invade them near their border with the Song. However, in August 1227, Genghis died of a historically uncertain cause, and, in order not <b>to</b> <b>jeopardize</b> the ongoing campaign, his death was kept a secret. In September 1227, Emperor Mozhu surrendered to the Mongols and was promptly executed. The Mongols then mercilessly pillaged Yinchuan, slaughtered the city's population, plundered the imperial tombs west of the city, and completed the effective annihilation of the Western Xia state.|$|E

The officer opened fire seconds after arriving on the scene, when Johnson was moving away from police. Johnson was allegedly a known gang member and also allegedly armed; a gun was recovered at the scene. The attorney for Johnson's family contends police planted the weapon. The city fought to keep the video of the incident secret so as not <b>to</b> <b>jeopardize</b> the officer's right to a fair trial should he be indicted. As in the McDonald case, the video lacks audio. The city released the video on December 7 due to pressure for transparency prompted by the McDonald case.

25|$|After the 1982 World Cup, in June, Maradona was {{transferred}} to Barcelona in Spain for a then world record fee of £5 million ($7.6 million). In 1983, under coach César Luis Menotti, Barcelona and Maradona won the Copa del Rey (Spain's annual national cup competition), beating Real Madrid, and the Spanish Super Cup, beating Athletic Bilbao. On 26 June 1983, Barcelona defeated Real Madrid {{on the road in}} one of the world's biggest club games, El Clásico, a match where Maradona scored and became the first Barcelona player to be applauded by archrival Real Madrid fans. Maradona dribbled past Madrid goalkeeper Agustín, and as he approached the empty goal, he stopped just as Madrid defender Juan José came sliding {{in a desperate attempt to}} block the shot and ended up crashing into the post, before Maradona slotted the ball into the net. The manner of the goal led to many inside the stadium start applauding; only Ronaldinho (in November 2005) and Andrés Iniesta (in November 2015) have since been granted such an ovation as Barcelona players from Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabéu. Due to illness and injury as well as controversial incidents on the field, Maradona had a difficult tenure in Barcelona. First a bout of hepatitis, then a broken ankle in a La Liga game at the Camp Nou in September 1983 caused by an ill-timed tackle by Athletic Bilbao's Andoni Goikoetxea, threatened <b>to</b> <b>jeopardize</b> Maradona's career, but with treatment and therapy, it was possible for him to return to the pitch after a three-month recovery period.|$|E
