5|$|Sarria {{was honored}} in 2005 with the San Francisco LGBT Pride Celebration Committee's Lifetime Achievement Grand Marshal Award. On May 25, 2006, Sarria's {{lifetime}} of activism was commemorated {{when the city}} of San Francisco renamed a section of 16th Street in the Castro to José Sarria Court. A plaque outlining Sarria's accomplishments is embedded in <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the Harvey Milk Memorial Branch of the San Francisco Public Library, which is located at 1 José Sarria Court.|$|E
5|$|When Milk's friends {{looked in}} his closet for a suit for his casket, they learned how much he had been {{affected}} by the recent decrease in his income as a supervisor. All of his clothes were coming apart; all of his socks had holes. He was cremated and his ashes were split, most of them scattered in San Francisco Bay by his closest friends. Some of them were encapsulated and buried beneath <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of 575 Castro Street, where Castro Camera had been located. There is a memorial to Milk also at Neptune Society Columbarium, ground floor, San Francisco, California. Harry Britt, one of four people Milk listed on his tape as an acceptable replacement should he be assassinated, was chosen to fill that position by the city's acting mayor, Dianne Feinstein.|$|E

50|$|Some laws {{prohibit}} bicycle {{riding in}} commercial areas, such as on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of stores. <b>In</b> other places a sign erected {{by a government}} must be followed, such as with no-riding zones in a college campus.|$|R
5000|$|The Beatles paid a {{visit to}} the Presidential Suite in August 1964 during their first U.S. tour. Due to the {{overwhelming}} number of fans crowding <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> hotel, the [...] "Fab Four" [...] were forced to access their room by landing atop the hotel in a helicopter.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of Second Street in Pomona, {{east from}} Gordon, ca. 1905. The center of street is bare, but <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> are crowded with {{pedestrians}} and bicyclers. Awnings shade <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> brick stores {{that line the}} street on either side. A particularly tall building with a dome room stands on the left...|$|R

25|$|A {{building}} at Sony Pictures Studios, formerly MGM Studios, in Culver City is named in her honor. A cast of her handprint and her signature are in <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of Theater 80, on St. Mark's Place in New York City.|$|E
25|$|On May 14, 2008 Markham-Cousins {{sent letters}} to {{students}} and family members explaining {{the reasons for the}} Fresh Start. She cited graduation rates and college preparation as two reasons why the program had to go forward. The same day, students staged a walk-out in protest of the program. Student drew with chalk on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the school in support of the teachers.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of Commercial Street looking North in Salem, Oregon, [s. d. ]. Two street cars {{ride the}} tracks that stripe the dirty road at center. Electrical poles line {{either side of}} the road while people roam <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks.</b> Businesses are packed along the sides of the streets with awnings that shade <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of them...|$|R
50|$|At first {{pedestrians}} climbed ladders to go between {{street level}} and <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> building entrances. Brick archways were constructed {{next to the}} road surface, above <b>the</b> submerged <b>sidewalks.</b> Skylights with small panes of clear glass (which later became amethyst-colored because of manganese in the glass) were installed, creating the area now called the Seattle Underground.|$|R
5000|$|By March 1908 {{the town}} had decreed that all streets in Aliceville should have ten foot {{sidewalks}} built on both sides. [...] Property owners were {{to be responsible for}} building <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of their parcels. [...] This work, along with the paving of the streets, was largely completed by June 1910 and the city began considering the installation of water and electricity.|$|R
25|$|Half of Flint's {{fourteen}} tallest {{buildings were}} built during the 1920s. The 19-story Genesee Towers, formerly the city's tallest building, {{was completed in}} 1968. The building became unused in later years and fell into severe disrepair: a cautionary sign warning of falling debris was put on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of it. An investment company purchased the building for $1, and it was demolished (by implosion) on December 22, 2013.|$|E
25|$|The narrow axis of {{the plan}} faces {{the street to the}} east, and the main {{entrance}} lies midway along the long side of the plan. The use of hip roofs includes a very large cantilevered hip roof over the living room terrace. The pitch of the main hip roof is shallow enough to give the passer-by on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the house the impression that it is a flat roof.|$|E
25|$|Through the {{combined}} efforts of two Phoenix philanthropists, Walter Bimson and Lewis Ruskin, Waddell received a commission in 1970 {{to create a}} major work for downtown Phoenix. When completed in 1974, Dance consisted of eleven life-sized figures in various dance positions and another figure playing the flute. Although the piece has been moved from its original location in the Phoenix Civic Plaza to <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the Herberger Theater, it remains Waddell’s tour de force in his adopted home of Arizona.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of {{a view of}} {{buildings}} on Ninth Street looking west from Spring Street in Los Angeles, June 25, 1930. Four large rectangular buildings {{can be seen on}} the far side of the street at right, while the edge of a fifth building can be seen in the foreground at left. Several pedestrians are visible on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> buildings, and an early-model automobile can be seen near the curb at right...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of Second Avenue in Upland, ca. 1905. The avenue lies {{at center}} with horse-drawn {{carriages}} driving {{on either side}} of it in the background. Electrical lines extend over the foreground while electrical poles line either side of the street.

A small building with a steep roof stands {{at the end of the}} road in the background...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{a view of}} Stewart and Mission Street, showing {{earthquake}} damage, San Francisco, 1906. The {{intersection of}} the Stewart and Mission Streets {{can be seen at}} center with tracks striping the cobblestone roads. "Stevedores Exchange" stands at the corner with the exterior walls of its second floor crumbled over <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of it. <b>The</b> debris has covered <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> all <b>the</b> way around the block, partially covering a sign on the right wall which reads "Gilt Edge Whiskeys"...|$|R
25|$|On March 6, 1978, {{during a}} legal battle related to {{obscenity}} in Gwinnett County, Georgia, Flynt and his local lawyer, Gene Reeves Jr., were returning to the courthouse when they were shot on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of 136 South Perry Street in Lawrenceville by a sniper standing near an alley across the street. The shooting left Flynt partially paralyzed with permanent spinal cord damage, {{and in need of}} a wheelchair. Flynt's injuries caused him constant, excruciating pain and he was addicted to painkillers until multiple surgeries deadened the affected nerves. He also suffered a stroke caused by one of several overdoses of his analgesic medications. He recovered but has had pronunciation difficulties since.|$|E
500|$|The {{names of}} the celebrities who {{performed}} at the club were written in cement on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of it, similar to Grauman's Chinese Theatre.|$|E
500|$|In July 1937, the Williams and McNeil {{families}} {{opened a}} boarding house on South Perry Street in downtown Montgomery. It {{was at this}} time that Williams decided to change his name informally from Hiram to Hank, a name he said was better suited to his desired career in country music. During the same year he participated in a talent show at the Empire Theater. He won the first prize of $15, singing his first original song [...] "WPA Blues". Williams wrote the lyrics and used the tune of Riley Puckett's [...] "Dissatisfied." [...] He never learned to read music and, {{for the rest of his}} career, based his compositions in storytelling. After school and on weekends Williams sang and played his Silvertone guitar on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the WSFA radio studios. His recent win at the Empire Theater and the street performances caught the attention of WSFA producers who occasionally invited him to perform on air. So many listeners contacted the radio station asking for more of [...] "the singing kid" [...] that the producers hired him to host his own 15-minute show twice a week for a weekly salary of US$15 (equivalent to US$0 in [...] ).|$|E
40|$|Photograph of a San Pedro street, showing {{automobiles}} {{on either}} side, ca. 1920 - 1929. Automobiles sit parked along {{either side of}} the street which reaches from the left foreground to the right distance.

The Mio Cafe and the OK Market stand in the foreground on the left with awnings shading <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of them. More shops crowd the street into the distance...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the {{exterior}} {{view of a}} two-story Greek-Revival-style building in Nevada's state capitol, Carson City, [s. d. ]. The building has a portico entry supported by four columns. Above the portico is a balcony where above it is a wide, plain pediment. On top of the inclined roof is a tower with arched openings (or windows). Tall trees, partially stripped of leaves (due to the season?), cover most of the yard and line <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> <b>front.</b> A metallic fence surrounds the building and its yard...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of Golden Gate {{refugees}} eating {{next to a}} sunk {{street on}} Sixteenth and Howard Street, San Francisco, 1906. The concrete squares of <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> foreground have shifted while the cobblestone street to the right has sunk into the ground. Several people walk along <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> further down <b>the</b> street while several others sit against the tall fence {{on the left and}} eat. Trees stand next to the wooden fences which line <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> buildings {{on either side of the}} street which extends from the right foreground to the center distance...|$|R
2500|$|When first {{opening the}} store, Stewart placed cases full of {{merchandise}} along <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> {{of the store}} {{as a way of}} advertising his establishment. Stewart claimed that [...] "the messy clutter in front of the store and pushing crowds advertised the business." ...|$|E
2500|$|Musician Jack Kelson {{recalled}} <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the Dunbar as {{the most}} desirable place to hang out on the city's coolest street. He said, [...] "That's my favorite spot on Central Avenue, that spot {{in the front of}} the Dunbar Hotel, because that to me was the hippest, most intimate, key spot of all the activity. [...] That's where all the night people hung out: the sportsmen, the businessmen, the dancers, everybody in show business, people who were somebody stayed at the hotel. … y far that block, that Dunbar Hotel, for me was it. [...] And it was it for, it seemed to me, everybody else. [...] Sooner or later you walked in front of that hotel, and that's where everybody congregated." ...|$|E
2500|$|From {{even its}} early days, {{students}} were {{no stranger to}} protest. [...] In May 1913, in retaliation for what students claimed were [...] "harsh methods", an effigy of the principal, J.E. Witmer, was hung from the telegraph wires {{in front of the}} school. [...] After the principal removed the effigy in the early evening, another was hung from the flagpole on top of the school. [...] When signs were found painted on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the school the next day, the local marshal took every male in the senior class into custody, ordering them to remove the signs under threat of arrest. [...] The next year, 110 students walked out on strike when the principal refused to grant a holiday for Columbus Day.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of an {{exterior}} {{view of the}} Bank of America building, ca. 1955. The twelve-story {{building is}} located {{on a street corner}} at center. It is a rectangular building with large arch-shaped openings on the bottom floor. The top floors can be identified by rows of identical windows. An American flag flies from the roof of the building at center. Many pedestrians are visible as they walk along <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> building, and automobiles {{can be seen in the}} street. At left, a police officer can be seen directing traffic...|$|R
50|$|While Evergreen {{is mostly}} {{composed}} of residential houses, it {{also features a}} neighborhood commercial area on the south boundary at Cold Spring Lane. The neighborhood streets are {{set up in a}} grid pattern with alleys. The driveways to the houses—that is, those few that have driveways—are accessible by the alleys. This allows <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> to be unbroken by curb cuts. The houses, which face the street, are surrounded by luscious greenery. Most houses have good-sized yards, well-tended gardens and a variety of trees, shrubs, and bushes. <b>The</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> houses promote communication between residents and allow for a close-knit community.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of an {{exterior}} {{view of the}} Sheraton Town House, {{across from}} Lafayette Park, corner of Wilshire and Commonwealth, as shown in an artist's rendering, October 20, 1928. The tall building stands at center with columns guarding its entrance and balconies outside many of its windows. Various trees stand against the walls while people walk through <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of them. Automobiles are parked along the street which lies <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the building {{as well as the}} intersecting street on the left. The corner of Lafayette Park {{can be seen in the}} right foreground...|$|R
2500|$|Many federal {{offices in}} {{downtown}} Washington had closed early {{that day in}} response to quickly developing blizzard conditions. Thus, there was a massive backup of traffic on {{almost all of the}} city's roads, making it very difficult for ambulances to reach the crash site. The Coast Guard's [...] harbor tugboat Capstan (WYTL 65601) [...] and its crew were based nearby; their duties include icebreaking and responding to water rescues. [...] The Capstan was considerably farther downriver on another search-and-rescue mission. Emergency ground response was greatly hampered by ice-covered roads and gridlocked traffic. Ambulances attempting to reach the scene were even driven down <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the White House. Rescuers who reached the site were unable to assist survivors in the water because they did not have adequate equipment to reach them. Below-freezing waters and heavy ice made swimming out to them impossible. [...] Multiple attempts to throw a makeshift lifeline (made out of belts and any other things available that could be tied together) out to the survivors proved ineffective. The rescue attempts by emergency officials and witnesses were recorded and broadcast live by area news reporters, and as the accident occurred in the nation's capital, there were large numbers of media personnel on hand to provide quick and extensive coverage.|$|E
60|$|As {{he stepped}} on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of Trinity Church, which stands at the {{beginning}} of Wall Street, he happened to glance up, and not far away saw Hardwick.|$|E
6000|$|... "Boys," [...] said Mr. Smith {{to the two}} hostlers, {{stepping}} out on to <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the hotel,--"hoist that there British Jack over the place and hoist her up good." ...|$|E
50|$|An {{investigation}} in 1903 noted that most {{public works projects}} had ceased {{because of lack of}} funds, but government crews repaved <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of his house. Another scandal involved the new treasurer William H. Wright, who was allowed to escape after he was found to have been pocketing government money with checks endorsed by Cooper.On February 23, 1903, he resigned as territorial secretary, and November 18 as superintendent of public works, after George R. Carter became governor. Carter expressed suspicion that public land deals were being rushed through, with possible conflict of interest by Cooper.|$|R
60|$|One of {{the strange}} cadets was driving the automobile, and hardly had it {{come to a stop}} when Merwell and Jasniff bounded out on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk,</b> {{directly}} <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of Dave and his friends.|$|R
25|$|The Aladdin was {{scheduled}} to reopen on August 17, 2000, at 6:00p.m., with fireworks at 10:00p.m. The opening was delayed while the Clark County building inspector completed its fire safety testing. Another delay was caused by last-minute repairs to the casino surveillance system. This left thousands of Aladdin visitors leaving in disappointment, as well as opening night hotel guests wondering where they'd spend the night. Many high-rollers waited out on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> Aladdin for hours. Most were unable to even get to their luggage, since the hotel had been locked down for testing. Aladdin employees tried to arrange alternate accommodations for the guests with Paris and Bellagio.|$|R
