50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Visitors</b> are {{composed}} largely of a dense form of cellulose, and they proceed to consume {{a quantity of}} trees and plant life in the US. Eventually, they start producing vehicles, superficially resembling human cars but capable of flying using the same unknown principles as <b>the</b> <b>Visitors</b> themselves, and apparently incorporating some element of intelligence, or at least instinct, since they do not crash into things as they move. The humans assume that <b>the</b> <b>Visitors</b> have created these vehicles as a gift {{in return for the}} plant matter which <b>the</b> <b>Visitors</b> are consuming, and the novel touches on the disruption such well-meaning gifts might incur on the Earth's economic systems. Toward the end of <b>the</b> book, <b>the</b> <b>Visitors</b> also start producing housing units for humans, and it is even implied that something living may be inside them — perhaps even a Visitor-produced version of humans themselves.|$|R

The miniseries' portrayal of human interaction with <b>the</b> <b>Visitors</b> bears resemblance to Occupied Europe during World War II, with some citizens choosing collaboration while others join underground resistance movements. Where the Nazis persecuted primarily Jews, <b>the</b> <b>Visitors</b> were depicted persecuting scientists, their families, and anyone associating with them. As <b>the</b> <b>Visitors</b> start eliminating scientists who could reveal their true nature, a Jewish family is shown hesitating helping their scientist neighbor and his family, until their grandfather suggests {{that to do}} otherwise would mean they hadn't learned anything from the past.|$|R
