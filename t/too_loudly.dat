At 11:10p.m. (PDT), while they were stopped at a red light at the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane in front of the Maxim Hotel, a vehicle occupied by two women pulled up on their left side. Shakur, who was standing up through the sunroof, exchanged words with the women and invited them to Club 662. At 11:15p.m. (PDT), a white, four-door, late-model Cadillac with an unknown number of occupants pulled up to the sedan's right side, rolled down a window, and rapidly fired gunshots at Shakur. He was hit four times, twice in the chest, once in the arm, and once in the thigh. One of the bullets went into Shakur's right lung. Knight was hit in the head by fragmentation. The bodyguard, Frank Alexander, stated that, when he was about to ride along with the rapper in Knight's car, Shakur asked him to drive the car of Shakur's fiancée, Kidada Jones, instead, in case they needed additional vehicles for the drive from Club 662 to the hotel. The bodyguard reported in his documentary, Before I Wake, that, shortly after the assault, one of the convoy's cars drove off after the assailant but that he never heard from the occupants.|$|E

Shostakovich was away on a concert tour in Arkhangelsk when he heard news of the first Pravda article. Two days before the article was published on the evening of 28 January, a friend had advised Shostakovich to attend the Bolshoi Theatre production of Lady Macbeth. When he arrived, he saw that Joseph Stalin and the Politburo were there. In letters written to his friend Ivan Sollertinsky, Shostakovich recounted the horror with which he watched as Stalin shuddered every time the brass and percussion played <b>too</b> <b>loudly.</b> Equally horrifying was the way Stalin and his companions laughed at the love-making scene between Sergei and Katerina.

40|$|The {{incendiary}} dynamic between {{race and}} welfare in the United States is well-known. An under explored {{aspect of this}} dynamic is how recipients of colour navigate the racial undercurrents that permeate welfare and which may result in differential treatment. Drawing from qualitative interviews with twenty-four recipients of colour, this study seeks to understand {{the ways in which}} they negotiate their relationships with workers. The study finds that to deflect racial stereotypes, participants monitor their behaviour for traces of anger that could be construed as ‘street’ rather than ‘decent’, and divorce themselves from those that don’t. Participants also rejected the discourse of citizenship, seeking to sooth and placate workers rather than asserting a right to benefits. This discourse replicates historical patterns of powerlessness in the United States, where the need to beseech rather than insist and avoid appearing <b>too</b> angry resonates <b>loudly</b> for people of colour. This serves to reinforce the dominant discourse of undeservingness and racial stereotyping within the welfare system...|$|R

2500|$|In 2003, Barbar {{was asked}} {{to return to a}} LARES {{installation}} he had just left, the Sunset Center in Carmel, California, as its new acoustic signature was perceived as being too long and too detailed. Bruno Weil, conductor of the Carmel Bach Festival, had requested Barbar to emulate within the Sunset Center the acoustics of a large church. Formerly characterized as having [...] "sponge-like acoustics", the Sunset Center's LARES-enhanced acoustics made coughs and rustlings from the audience be heard <b>too</b> <b>loudly</b> on stage, and reverberation in the audience area was likened to [...] "the Grand Canyon" [...] by one observer. The City of Carmel paid US$10,000 for Barbar's extra ten days of tuning the system. With the assistance of Carmel Bach Festival management, the system was re-tuned with favorable results. Music critic Scott MacClelland wrote: [...] "The search for the optimal acoustic in the Sunset auditorium continues. A controversial electronic enhancement system was built into the renovation – to compensate for some inherent shortcomings of the room — and was freshly tweaked by its designer before this year’s festival began. (It was even further adjusted between the opening Saturday night program and the Sunday matinee under review.) Most of the undesirable artifacts of the original tuning are now gone, and the sonic imagery today may be as good as it gets." ...|$|E
60|$|After {{the youngsters}} had {{finished}} dinner, the schoolroom was cleared by the guests; benches were ranged {{along the entire}} room, excepting the upper end, where a table, with two large candlesticks at either end, served as a stage for the young actors. When all was arranged, the elder Indians seated themselves on the benches, while {{the boys and girls}} ranged themselves along the wall behind the table. Mr Evans then began by causing a little boy about four years old to recite a long comical piece of prose in English. Having been well drilled for weeks beforehand, he did it in the most laughable style. Then came forward four little girls, who kept up an animated philosophical discussion as to the difference of the days in the moon and on the earth. Then a bigger boy made a long speech in the Seauteaux language, at which the Indians laughed immensely, and with which the white people present (who did not understand a word of it) appeared to be greatly delighted, and laughed <b>loudly</b> <b>too.</b> Then the whole of the little band, upon a sign being given by Mr Evans, burst at once into a really beautiful hymn, which was quite unexpected, and consequently all the more gratifying. This concluded the examination, if I may so call it; and after a short prayer the Indians departed to their homes, highly delighted with their entertainment. Such was the Christmas feast at Rossville, and many a laugh it afforded us that night as we returned home across the frozen lake by the pale moonlight.|$|R
