25|$|The modern {{convention}} {{of moving the}} Olympic flame via a relay system from Greece to the Olympic venue began in 1936 in Germany. Carl Diem devised {{the idea of the}} torch relay for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin that was organized by the Nazis under the guidance of Joseph Goebbels. The Krupp armaments company produced the torches in wood and metal, inspired by an olive leaf. The Olympic flame was lit by a concave mirror in Olympia, Greece and transported over 3,187 kilometres by 3,331 runners in twelve days and eleven nights from Greece to Berlin. Leni Riefenstahl later staged the torch relay for the 1938 film Olympia. Adolf Hitler saw the link with the ancient Games as <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> illustrate his belief that classical Greece was an Aryan forerunner of the modern German Reich. There were minor protests in Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia on the way, which were suppressed by the local security forces.|$|E

He personifies that bullheaded 'you listen to me because I’m always right' attitude in such a believable manner that you think he is that guy.

25|$|Since 206 BC, when Scipio Africanus finally {{expelled}} the Carthaginians from Iberia (see {{the battle}} of Ilipa), he was preoccupied {{with the idea that}} Africa should be the next target. To this end he concluded an alliance with Syphax – {{one of the most powerful}} Numidian rulers at the time and an old foe of Carthage – even before he got authority from Rome to lead the future invasion. Even though Scipio was elected consul for 205 BC, he had to endure hard political wrangling before the Senate approved his intentions. His main opponent was Quintus Fabius Maximus Cunctator (the Delayer), who argued that the expedition to Africa was too risky and that the primary objective was to fight Hannibal in Bruttium. Scipio managed to persuade the senators that his plan was <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> force the Carthaginians out of Italy. Nevertheless, he was not given enough resources and had to spend a whole year in preparations.|$|E
25|$|The film had {{its roots}} in an earlier concept for a new King Kong feature {{developed}} by Willis O'Brien, animator of the original stop-motion Kong. Around 1960, O'Brien {{came up with a}} proposed treatment, King Kong meets Frankenstein, where Kong would fight against a giant version of Frankenstein's monster in San Francisco. O'Brien took the project (which consisted of some concept art and a screenplay treatment) to RKO to secure permission to use the King Kong character. During this time the story was renamed King Kong vs. the Ginko when it was believed that Universal had the rights to the Frankenstein name (it actually only had the rights to the monster's makeup design). O'Brien was introduced to producer John Beck, who promised to find a studio to make the film (at this point in time, RKO was no longer a production company). Beck took the story treatment and had George Worthing Yates flesh it out into a screenplay. The story was slightly altered and the title changed to King Kong vs. Prometheus, returning the name to the original Frankenstein concept (The Modern Prometheus was the alternate name of Frankenstein in the original novel). Unfortunately, the cost of stop-motion animation discouraged potential studios from putting the film into production. After shopping the script around overseas, Beck eventually attracted the interest of the Japanese studio Toho, which had long wanted to make a King Kong film and was also planning for Godzilla to make a comeback around the same time. After purchasing the script, they decided to replace the Frankenstein creature with Godzilla to be King Kong's opponent and would have Shinichi Sekizawa rewrite Yates's script. The studio thought that it would be <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> celebrate its thirtieth year in production. It was one of 5 big banner releases for the company to celebrate the anniversary alongside Sanjuro, , Lonely Lane, and Born in Sin. John Beck's dealings with Willis O'Brien's project were done behind his back and O'Brien was never credited for his idea. In 1963, Merian C. Cooper attempted to file a lawsuit against John Beck claiming that he outright owned the King Kong character, but the lawsuit never went through as it turned out he was not Kong's sole legal owner as he had previously believed.|$|E

And insofar as this keeps working, it's managed to turn the TV equivalent of a fun B-movie into a superior television show." [...] Overall, Schwartz awarded the season an 8.8 out of 10, stating the season was [...] "the best [...] ever been, maturing as a show and learning the right lessons from what's come before." [...] She praised the pod format, saying it [...] "helped tighten the season {{and give it a}} stronger throughline" [...] and added that each new pod the season introduced was more successful than the previous, with the Agents of Hydra pod and Framework story arc possibly the strongest of the entire series. Schwartz also spoke fondly of the guest stars throughout the season, particularly Jansen, who she called [...] "the season's MVP" [...] and felt [...] "stole the show" [...] with Aida, who was [...] "the standout new character" [...] of the season. Some negatives on the season were the additional villains, Eli Morrow and the Superior (not [...] "a particularly standout villain", and never [...] "as imposing or terrifying as he should have been", respectively), and some of the early effects work, though she also praised [...] "the great CGI work" [...] with Ghost Rider. Den of Geeks Rob Leane also praised the pod format, saying it [...] "fixed the 22-episode problem". He felt the Ghost Rider pod had amazing visual effects, and was a [...] "natural" [...] length that other series may have stretched further. He also highlighted Wen's performance as LMD May in the LMD pod and the Agents of Hydra pod's Mack and Hope storyline, and praised the guest performances of Luna and Jansen (feeling that bringing the latter two together in the finale [...] "was <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> wrap things up"). Leane called the season [...] "a master class in how Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. can thrive going forward ... the writers keep throwing in more sci-fi concepts, the special effects team keep delivering, and the cast keep stepping up their game to keep up with it all." ...|$|E

Though Davies had intended the serial to end with the Tenth Doctor visiting his former companions, he struggled with how to include Rose. An initial idea was for Rose to appear with her part-human Doctor in the parallel universe, where both would sense the original Tenth Doctor regenerating. However, Davies felt this would raise too many questions about {{their lives in the}} parallel universe.

During the episode Piper's character has dialogue solely with John Hurt's War Doctor, and is unseen by the other characters, including the Tenth Doctor.

[...] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter said the screenplay by Simon Pegg and Doug Jung [...] "injects a welcome strain of humor that's true to the original Gene Roddenberry creation, delivering nostalgia without stiff veneration", and went on by saying, [...] "While Beyond won't unseat 1982's thrilling [...] as the gold standard for Star Trek movies, it's a highly entertaining entry guaranteed to give the franchise continuing life." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Variety, in an otherwise positive review, described the film being: [...] "a very familiar, old-fangled, no-mystery structure, and that’s because it’s basically the Star Trek version of an interplanetary action film, with a plot that doesn’t take you to many new frontiers." [...] Furthermore, he called Star Trek Beyond [...] "a somewhat diverting place holder, but one hopes that the next Star Trek movie will {{have what it takes to}} boldly go where no Star Trek movie has gone before." [...] Mark Hugues of Forbes said, [...] "Star Trek Beyond is the third-best Star Trek film of all time, creating the sort of emotional connection and familiar, powerful characterizations we loved in the original series while delivering top-notch action and the best Star Trek movie villain since First Contacts Borg Queen." ...|$|E
