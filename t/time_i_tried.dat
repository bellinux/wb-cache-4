500|$|In September 2014, Wirkola {{announced}} {{that he would not be}} returning to direct the sequel: “I have been lately attached to a few more things, it’s just a matter of time and priorities. I did Dead Snow, then Hansel & Gretel, and then [...] I want to do something a little bit different now and not just do sequels. I did write the script and I hope to be involved in it. But yeah, I won’t be directing it.” He said [...] "the first film was a learning curve for me working in the studio system and the script I wrote for the original was so different [...] We ended up taking a lot out and altering stuff that first <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> taking what I learned and still delivered a sequel script that’s an R-rated action film." [...] Cinema Blend reported Renner said that despite his busy schedule he agreed to reprise the role of Hansel because the first film [...] "was a lot of fun doing the movie," [...] but without Wirkola directing again he might be less likely to return for the sequel.|$|E
2500|$|Once in Amman, Arar {{claims he}} was blindfolded, {{shackled}} {{and put in a}} van. [...] "They made me bend my head down in the back seat," [...] Arar recalled. [...] "Then these men started beating me. Every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to talk, they beat me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The race {{restarted}} with 129 laps {{to go and}} a multi-car wreck {{brought out}} the seventh caution of the race. It started when Busch spun out and collected Brad Keselowski. Matt Kenseth, Paul Menard, Ryan Blaney, Jimmie Johnson and Elliott all suffered damage in the wreck. Busch said afterwards {{that he thought he}} [...] "just missed the bottom groove by a few inches, got loose and the wreck was on. The way that our car was restarting it felt comfortable, it felt good. That inside with the rosin and the VHT, if you don’t hit it exactly right you lose a lot of <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> {{to make up for it}} and got loose. I feel really bad for the Monster Energy guys. We had a win in our sights and I just drove the car at 101 percent instead of that 99 that I probably needed to be at." [...] Joey Logano assumed the race lead.|$|E

2500|$|The {{results of}} Vlašić's final {{year as a}} junior showed further {{development}} as a high jumper. She set a new indoor best of 1.92m at the 2002 European Indoor Championships and was the favourite to win the 2002 World Juniors. She won the competition {{by a margin of}} nine centimetres, setting a new personal best of 1.96m and attempting the symbolic two metres height. She failed to pass the bar but remained pleased with her achievements: [...] "This was the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> the 2-metre mark. That would have been a bonus. Today what matters is the gold. I am very happy I retained my world junior title". At the final major event of the season, the European Championships, she could not repeat her previous form and finished in fifth place. Nevertheless, {{at the end of the}} year she was ranked in the top ten high jumpers in the world for the season.|$|E
2500|$|I learned quite a {{lot from}} him, I must say. I learned that {{you have got to}} work at it. You have to rehearse. When I came back and I got the band (Earth) back together, I made sure that {{everybody}} was up {{early in the morning and}} rehearsing. I used to go and pick them up. I was the only one at the time that could drive. I used to have to drive the bloody van and get them up at quarter to nine every morning; which was, believe me, early for us then. I said to them, [...] "This is how we have got to do it because this is how Jethro Tull did it." [...] They had a schedule and they knew that they were going to work from this time till that <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> that with our band and we got into doing it. It worked. Instead of just strolling in at any hour, it made it more like we were saying, [...] "Let’s do it!" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Happy Anniversary" [...] {{is written}} {{from the point}} of view of a dying loved one, which Pierre based on his grandmother, who died several years prior of cancer. [...] " [...] is {{basically}} [...] from the person's point of view who is dying, and all of the things that they can't necessarily say to the person that they're leaving behind," [...] remarked Pierre. The event occurred in late 2009, shortly after the band had learned of a [...] "big break, this big opportunity," [...] which Pierre skipped out on to go see his ailing grandmother. [...] "It was a weird experience being with this shell of a woman that I used to know. She couldn't move or communicate," [...] he later said; she passed the next morning. He noted that had he not gone, he would not have had another experience with her, which factored into the song’s lyrics to live in the moment. The band considered it the darkest on the album. The song was so personal, it affected the group recording the song. [...] "The song gives me shivers. I couldn't sing the song [...] I kept breaking down every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to sing it. It was really weird," [...] said Pierre. Pierre interpreted the final song on the album, [...] "Floating Down the River", as a celebration of his newfound excitement for life.|$|E

A few <b>times,</b> <b>I</b> slipped and saw {{a couple of the}} rocks fall and God spared me many <b>times.</b> <b>I</b> just never could figure out why until this past year.” ...|$|R

60|$|After a <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to {{disengage}} her arms, but found {{this to be}} impossible without a degree of violence which I could not exert. Overcome by the strain, and probably by long want of rest, the poor child soon fell into a profound slumber.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! true, it is {{possible}} to exist on a pipe of tea-leaves for a time, but only for a <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> it myself once, in desperation, when I ran short of tobacco on a journey, and found it execrable, but better than nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|Instantly she remembered--as {{clearly as}} though she were {{actually}} listening to the voice and words--that her mother had burst out, [...] "Drat that bird, it does seem as if every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to take a nap he just tries to wake me up." [...] Una laughed grimly. Hastily she reproved herself, [...] "Oh, but mother didn't mean--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Horrible news, Walter! Let us {{go back to}} London--I don't want to stop here--I {{am sorry}} I ever came.

5000|$|Tian {{has said}} that, [...] "When I do have free <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to find random, new things and I am obsessed with {{learning}} new things and meeting new people.

60|$|Twice a day {{for many}} days this youth came to my cell with food, and ever the same {{greetings}} from Zat Arrras. For a long <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to engage him in conversation upon other matters, {{but he would not}} talk, and so, at length, I desisted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course not. Who'd {{expect me}} to see {{anything}} else when I'm beside her?" [...] retorted Bob. [...] "But what has made you change your mind?

I realize that when <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to control, <b>I</b> control less. I realize that every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to color inside the lines that the color leaks out. I realize that understanding begins by admitting I don‘t understand. In physics, the uncertainty principle embodies the resistance to precision. The art begins formalized, boundary-delimited and planar, and then begins to quickly escape and deform and seek other dimensions.“ ...|$|R

60|$|And now I had awakened, {{without any}} {{assignable}} cause, hours before my usual <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to compose myself to sleep again. The effort was useless.

5000|$|Paglia {{said of her}} {{objectives}} {{with the}} book, [...] "It was intended to please no one and to offend everyone. The entire process of the book was to discover the repressed elements of contemporary culture, whatever they are, and palpate them.

I want precision and historical knowledge, {{but at the same}} <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to zap it with pornographic intensity." ...|$|R
