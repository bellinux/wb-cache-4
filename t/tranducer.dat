We first proved that two equivalent Z-automata are related by a series of three conjugacies — we shall define conjugacy later in the paper — and then that every conjugacy relation can be decomposed into a sequence of three operations: state (out-) splitting (also known as covering), circulation of coefficients, and state (in-) merging (also known as co-covering). Altogether, we reached a decomposition of any equivalence between Z-automata as the one described at Figure 1 [Conjugacy is represented by double-line arrows, coverings by simple solid arrows, co-coverings by simple dashed arrows, and circulation by simple dotted arrows]...|$|R
