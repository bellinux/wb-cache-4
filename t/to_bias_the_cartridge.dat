50|$|Where {{the cost}} or {{impact of a}} Type I error {{is much greater than}} the cost of a Type II error (e.g. the water is safe to drink), it can be {{worthwhile}} <b>to</b> <b>bias</b> <b>the</b> decision-making system towards making fewer Type I errors, i.e. making it less likely to conclude that a particular situation exists. This by definition would also increase the number of Type II errors. Conversely, where a false positive is much less costly than a false negative (blood tests, smoke detectors), it makes sense <b>to</b> <b>bias</b> <b>the</b> system towards maximising the probability that a particular (very costly) situation will be recognised, even if this often leads to the (relatively un-costly) event of noticing something that is not actually there.

40|$|For the {{selection}} of relevant information out of a continuous stream of information, which is a common definition of attention, two core mechanisms are assumed: a competition-based comparison of the neuronal activity in sensory areas and the top-down modulation of this competition by frontal executive control functions. Those control functions are thought <b>to</b> <b>bias</b> <b>the</b> processing of information towards the intended goals. Acute stress is thought to impair these frontal functions through the release of cortisol. In the present study, subjects had to detect a luminance change of a stimulus and ignore more salient but task irrelevant orientation changes. Before the execution of this task, subjects underwent a socially evaluated cold pressor test (SECPT) or a non-stressful control situation. The SECPT revealed reliable stress response with a significant increase of cortisol and alpha-amylase. Stressed subjects showed higher error rates than controls, particularly in conditions which require top-down control processing <b>to</b> <b>bias</b> <b>the</b> less salient target feature against the more salient and spatially separated distracter. By means of the EEG, subjects who got stressed showed a reduced allocation to the relevant luminance change apparent in a modulation of the N 1 pc. The following N 2 pc, which reflects a re-allocation of attentional resources, supports the error pattern. There was only an N 2 pc in conditions, which required <b>to</b> <b>bias</b> <b>the</b> less salient luminance change. Moreover, this N 2 pc was decreased {{as a consequence of}} the induced stress. These results allow the conclusion that acute stress impairs the intention-based attentional allocation and enhances the stimulus-driven selection, leading to a strong distractibility during attentional information selection...|$|R
