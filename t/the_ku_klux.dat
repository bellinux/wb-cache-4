5|$|Social {{tensions}} were {{exacerbated by}} the revival of <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, $1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to {{be as high as}} 300 people. By the late 1920s, <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.|$|E

5|$|Although Haynes was a prohibitionist, he was {{a critic}} of the Indiana Branch of <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan, which was in the height of its power during the 1910s and 1920s. In letters to friends and fellow prohibitionists, he {{ridiculed}} the organization for using violent and illegal tactics to achieve prohibition, and accused them of hypocrisy for supporting many anti-prohibition Democratic politicians. Kokomo politics was dominated by the Klan during that period and it is unknown if Haynes spoke publicly against the organization.|$|E

Though he opposed ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, he used his influence as governor to effect passage of laws admitting the testimony of blacks in court and providing for an educational system for recently freed slaves. He also helped quell violence perpetrated by <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan {{in many areas of}} the state.|$|E
5|$|One of the lynchers {{may have}} been Charley Guthrie (died 1956), father of the folk singer Woody Guthrie, {{who was born in}} Okemah 14 months after the lynching. Charley was an Okemah {{real-estate}} agent, district court clerk, Democratic politician, Freemason and owner of the town's first automobile. According to Joe Klein, he was also a member of <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan in the 1920s. There is no documentary evidence that Charley was a Klansman.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} the full Senate {{considered}} Black's nomination. Rumors relating to Black's involvement in <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan surfaced among the senators, and two Democratic senators tried defeating the nomination. However, no conclusive evidence of Black's involvement was available at the time, so after six hours of debate, the Senate voted 63–16 to confirm Black. Ten Republicans and six Democrats voted against Black. Alabama Governor Bibb Graves appointed his own wife, Dixie B. Graves, to fill Black's vacated seat.|$|E

5|$|Tupper's role as {{the founder}} of the first {{university}} dedicated to educating freedmen attracted opposition.

In 1870 the trustees of the local Second Baptist Church of Raleigh sued Tupper on charges of defrauding its members in relation to his fundraising for Shaw College. The suit was settled in his favor in 1875.|$|E
5|$|From 1890 to 1910, poll {{taxes and}} {{literacy}} tests were instituted across the South, effectively disenfranchising {{the great majority}} of black men. White male-only primary elections also served to reduce the influence of black men in the political system. Along with increasing legal obstacles, blacks were excluded from the political system by threats of violent reprisals by whites in the form of lynch mobs and terrorist attacks by <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan. Some Democrats even advocated a repeal of the amendment, such as William Bourke Cockran of New York.|$|E
5|$|Hiram Wesley Evans (September 26, 1881– September 14, 1966) was Imperial Wizard of <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan, an American white {{supremacist}} group, from 1922 to 1939. A native of Alabama, Evans attended Vanderbilt University {{and became a}} dentist. He operated a small, moderately successful practice in Texas until 1920, {{when he joined the}} Klan's Dallas chapter. He quickly rose through the ranks and was part of a group that ousted William Joseph Simmons from the position of Imperial Wizard, the national leader, in November 1922. Evans succeeded him and sought to transform the group into a political power.|$|E

5|$|Mississippi Burning is a 1988 American crime thriller film {{directed}} by Alan Parker, and written by Chris Gerolmo.

The film stars Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe as two FBI agents assigned to investigate the disappearance of three civil rights workers in fictional Jessup County, Mississippi. The investigation is met with hostility and backlash by the town's residents, local police and <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan (KKK).|$|E
5|$|Morrow urged {{enforcement}} of state laws against carrying concealed weapons and restricted activities of <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan. During {{his first year}} in office, he granted only 100 pardons. This was a considerable decrease from the number granted by his immediate predecessors. During their first years in office, J. C. W. Beckham granted 350 pardons, James B. McCreary (during his second stint as governor) granted 139, and Augustus O. Stanley granted 257. He was also {{an active member of the}} Commission on Interracial Cooperation, a society for the elimination of racial violence in the South.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{social changes}} during this period, {{especially}} the 1920s, {{led to the}} reemergence of <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan in the urban centers of Texas, with their strongest presence in Dallas. As in other states, the new Klan was not outwardly focused on suppression of black civil rights, but instead supported traditional morality including opposition to bootlegging, gambling, and other vices that had grown during the period. Bigotry, though, was never far from the group's agenda. During the Depression, anti-New Deal sentiments among some leaders, such as John Kirby, led to their becoming loosely associated with the Klan and its ideals.|$|E

5|$|The {{society has}} been {{influential}} {{in the history of}} Georgia Tech.

The society also claims involvement in a number of civil rights projects, most notably in peacefully integrating Georgia Tech's first African American students and preventing <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan from setting up a student chapter at Georgia Tech. These claims have yet to be substantiated by independent sources.|$|E
5|$|Galveston's {{attitudes toward}} race were at times {{unique in the}} region. The strict segregationalist attitudes {{prevalent}} {{in many parts of}} the U.S. were not always as stark in Galveston's society as in some other parts of Texas. One of the most striking examples of this was the gradual establishment of biracial labor unions of waterfront workers beginning in the 19th century, although eventually this alliance fell victim to segregationist influence. Racist ideology was always an ever-present factor in the city, however, as evinced by the name of the group which ran the Mardi Gras, the Kotton Karnival Kids (KKK, the same initials as <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan).|$|E
5|$|In 1914 he had {{a highly}} publicized meeting with President Woodrow Wilson, in which he protested Wilson's {{introduction}} of segregation into the federal workplace. In Boston, Trotter succeeded in 1910 in shutting down productions of The Clansman but he was unsuccessful in 1915 with screenings of the movie The Birth of a Nation, which also portrayed <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan in favorable terms. He {{was not able to}} influence the peace talks at the end of World War I, and was in later years a marginalized voice of protest. In an alliance with Roman Catholics, in 1921 he did get a revival screening banned of The Birth of a Nation. He died on his 62nd birthday after a possibly suicidal fall from his Boston home.|$|E
