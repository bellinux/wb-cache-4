40|$|A {{selective}} {{membrane filtration}} medium is described {{for use in}} the rapid assessment of water quality in tropical countries where the incidence of faecal coliforms other than E. coli presents problems in the interpretation of results. The medium gives comparable results to MPN values obtained in the multiple tube dilution test using modified Gray's glutamate medium, and to membrane filtration counts obtained using M-FC broth and membrane-enriched <b>Teepol</b> <b>broth,</b> whilst differentiation of E. coli is enhanced...|$|E
40|$|Total {{coliform}} counts {{obtained by}} means of standard membrane filtration techniques, using MacConkey agar, m-Endo LES agar, Teepol agar, and pads saturated with <b>Teepol</b> <b>broth</b> as growth media, were compared. Various combinations of these media were used in tests on 490 samples of river water and city wastewater after different stages of conventional purification and reclamation processes including lime treatment, and filtration, active carbon treatment, ozonation, and chlorination. Endo agar yielded the highest average counts for all these samples. Teepol agar generally had higher counts then <b>Teepol</b> <b>broth,</b> whereas MacConkey agar had the lowest average counts. Identification of 871 positive isolates showed that Aeromonas hydrophila was the species most commonly detected. Species of Escherichia, Citrobacter, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter represented 55 % of isolates which conformed {{to the definition of}} total coliforms on Endo agar, 54 % on Teepol agar, and 45 % on MacConkey agar. Selection for species on the media differed considerably. Evaluation of these data and literature on alternative tests, including most probable number methods, indicated that the technique of choice for routine analysis of total coliform bacteria in drinking water is membrane filtration using m-Endo LES agar as growth medium without enrichment procedures or a cytochrome oxidase restriction...|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of Vibrio parahaemolyticus cells to refrigeration and frozen storage {{and the development}} of a method for detecting injured and uninjured V. parahaemolyticus cells were studied. Cell suspensions in different kinds of seafood homogenates were either regrigerated (4 °C) or frozen (− 20 °C), stored, and examined for cell survival during storage. V. parahaemolyticus cells were sensitive to both storage temperatures. Many cells died, and many survivors were sublethally injured. In general, refrigeration storage appeared to be more injurious than frozen storage. The initial recovery of the sublethally injured cells was highest in a nutritionally rich, nonselective liquid medium such as Trypticase soy broth, whereas maximum cell multiplication was observed in Trypticase soy broth containing 3 % NaCl. The sublethally injured V. parahaemolyticus cells demonstrated sensitivity to the selective enrichment medium, glucose salt <b>teepol</b> <b>broth.</b> From these findings, a new method (designated as the “repair-detection” method) was developed for the isolation and enumeration of V. parahaemolyticus. Comparative studies between the recommended and the repair-detection methods showed that injured V. parahaemolyticus cells were present in commercial seafoods and that the repair-detection method was definitely more effective for the detection of total numbers of V. parahaemolyticus cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{magnesium}} and iron salts on the recovery {{and growth of}} chill-stressed cells of Vibrio parahaemolyticus were studied. Supplementation of glucose salt <b>Teepol</b> (GST) <b>broth</b> with 20 to 100 mM of Mg 2 + significantly (P {{less than or equal}} to 0. 05) increased the number of cells recovered from oyster homogenate stored at 3 degrees C. Populations detected with supplemented GST were comparable to those obtained with Horie arabinose ethyl violet (HAE) broth, with or without Mg 2 +. Recovery of V. parahaemolyticus from homogenates stored at - 18 degrees C was also improved when enrichment broths supplemented with Mg 2 + were used. Ferric iron (added as FeCl 3) at 240 microM in GST and 240 or 960 microM in HAE significantly enhanced the extent of recovery of chilled cells. Ferrous iron was generally less effective. Teepol did not influence the growth of nonchilled cells, but significantly reduced the viable population in suspensions of chilled cells when used at a level of 0. 4 % in GST. The relatively high pH (9. 0) of HAE caused a significant reduction in the number of viable, chill-stressed cells of V. parahaemolyticus. The overall results indicated that HAE broth is superior to GST for recovering V. parahaemolyticus from refrigerated and frozen oyster homogenates...|$|R
40|$|MacConkey agar, {{standard}} M-FC agar, M-FC agar without rosolic acid, M-FC agar with a resuscitation top layer, Teepol agar, and pads {{saturated with}} <b>Teepol</b> <b>broth,</b> were evaluated as growth media for membrane filtration counting of fecal coliform bacteria in water. In comparative tests on 312 samples {{of water from}} a wide variety of sources, including chlorinated effluents, M-FC agar without rosolic acid proved the medium of choice because it generally yielded the highest counts, was readily obtainable, easy to prepare and handle, and yielded clearly recognizable fecal coliform colonies. Identification of 1, 139 fecal coliform isolates showed that fecal coliform tests cannot be used to enumerate Escherichia coli because the incidence of E. coli among fecal coliforms varied from an average of 51 % for river water to 93 % for an activated sludge effluent after chlorination. The incidence of Klebsiella pneumoniae among fecal coliforms varied from an average of 4 % for the activated sludge effluent after chlorination to 32 % for the river water. The advantages of a standard membrane filtration procedure for routine counting of fecal coliforms in water using M-FC agar without rosolic acid as growth medium, in the absence of preincubation or resuscitation steps, are outlined...|$|E
