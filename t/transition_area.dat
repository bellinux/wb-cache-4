25|$|The cycling stage {{proceeds}} {{around a}} marked course, typically on public roads. In many cases, especially smaller triathlons, roads are not closed to automobiles; however, traffic coordinators are often present to help control traffic. Typically, the cycling stage finishes {{back at the}} same <b>transition</b> <b>area.</b> Racers enter the <b>transition</b> <b>area,</b> rack their bicycles, and quickly change into running shoes before heading out for the final stage. The running stage usually ends at a separate finish line near the <b>transition</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E

25|$|The swim leg usually {{proceeds}} {{around a}} series of marked buoys before athletes exit the water near the <b>transition</b> <b>area.</b> Racers exit out of the water, enter the <b>transition</b> <b>area,</b> and change from their swim gear and into their cycling gear. Competition and pressure for faster times {{have led to the}} development of specialized triathlon clothing that is adequate for both swimming and cycling, allowing many racers to have a transition that consists of only removing their wetsuit, cap, and goggles and pulling on a helmet and cycling shoes. In some cases, racers leave their cycling shoes attached to their bicycle pedals and slip their feet into them while riding. Some triathletes don't wear socks, decreasing their time spent in transition even more.|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} whether patterns of avian species turnover reflect either biome or climate transitions at a regional scale, and whether anthropogenic landscape transformation affects those patterns. Location: South Africa and Lesotho. Methods: Biome and land transformation data {{were used to}} identify sets of <b>transition</b> <b>areas,</b> and avian species occurrence data were used to measure species turnover rates (β-diversity). Spatial congruence between <b>areas</b> of biome <b>transition,</b> <b>areas</b> of high vegetation heterogeneity, high climatic heterogeneity, and high β-diversity was assessed using random draw techniques. Spatial overlap in anthropogenically transformed areas, areas of high climatic heterogeneity and high β-diversity areas was also assessed. Results: Biome <b>transition</b> <b>areas</b> had greater vegetation heterogeneity, climatic heterogeneity, and β-diversity than expected by chance. For the land transformation <b>transition</b> <b>areas,</b> this was only true for land transformation heterogeneity values and {{for one of the}} β-diversity measures. Avian presence/ absence data clearly separated the biome types but not the land transformation types. Main conclusions: Biome edges have elevated climatic and vegetation heterogeneity. More importantly, elevated β-diversity in the avifauna is clearly reflected in the heterogeneous biome <b>transition</b> <b>areas.</b> Thus, there is spatial congruence in biome <b>transition</b> <b>areas</b> (identified on vegetation and climatic grounds) and avian turnover patterns. However, there is no congruence between avian turnover and land transformation <b>transition</b> <b>areas.</b> This suggests that biogeographical patterns can be recovered using modern data despite landscape transformation.

25|$|The Ohio River is a climatic <b>transition</b> <b>area,</b> as {{its water}} {{runs along the}} {{periphery}} of the humid subtropical and humid continental climate areas. It is inhabited by fauna and flora of both climates. In winter, it regularly freezes over at Pittsburgh but rarely further south toward Cincinnati and Louisville. At Paducah, Kentucky, in the south, near the Ohio's confluence with the Mississippi, it is ice-free year-round. Paducah was founded there because it is the northernmost ice-free reach of the Ohio.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{participation}} in a triathlon requires an athlete to register and sign up {{in advance of the}} actual race. After registration, racers are often provided a race number, colored swim cap, and, if the event is being electronically timed, a timing band. Athletes will either be provided or briefed on details of the course, rules, and any problems to look out for (road conditions, closures, traffic lights, aid stations). At a major event, such as an Ironman or a long course championship, triathletes may be required to set up and check-in their bike in the <b>transition</b> <b>area</b> a day or two before the race start, leaving it overnight and under guard.|$|E
25|$|A <b>transition</b> <b>area</b> is set {{up where}} the athletes change gear for {{different}} segments of the race. This is where the switches from swimming to cycling and cycling to running occur. These areas are used to store bicycles, performance apparel, and any other accessories needed for {{the next stage of}} the race. The transition from swim to bike is referred to as T1 and that between the bike and run is referred to as T2. The athlete's overall time for the race includes time spent in T1 and T2. Transition areas vary in size depending on the number of participants expected. In addition, these areas provide a social headquarters before the race.|$|E

500|$|Spokane {{lies in the}} Northern Rockies {{ecoregion}} {{near the}} eastern edge of the basaltic Channeled Scablands steppe, a plain that then eventually rises sharply to the east towards the rugged, timbered Rocky Mountain foothills, the Selkirk Mountains. It is in a <b>transition</b> <b>area</b> between the barren landscape of the Columbia Basin and the coniferous forests to the east; to the south are the lush prairies and rolling hills of the Palouse. The highest peak in Spokane County is Mount Spokane, at an elevation of , located on the eastern side of the Selkirk Mountains. The most prominent water feature in the area is the Spokane River, a [...] tributary of the Columbia River, originating from Lake Coeur d'Alene in northern Idaho. The river flows west across the Washington state line through downtown Spokane, meeting Latah Creek, then turns to the northwest, where it is joined by the Little Spokane River on its way to the Columbia River, north of Davenport. The Channeled Scablands and many of the area's numerous large lakes, such as Lake Coeur d'Alene and Lake Pend Oreille, were formed by the Missoula Floods after the ice-dammed Glacial Lake Missoula ruptured at the end of the last ice age. The Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge south of Cheney is the closest natural reserve, the closest National Forest is the Colville National Forest, the closest National Recreation Area is the Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area and the closest national park is Mount Rainier National Park, approximately a four-and-a-half hour drive away from Spokane.|$|E
