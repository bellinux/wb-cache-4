The noticeable <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> clock design is the length of the second hand. While the minute and hour hands never went outside the circle at the centre, the second hand went out as far as the bats wings themselves, making the second hand easily twice as long as the minute hand. The clock was occasionally accompanied by the BBC Pips when a programme started on the hour.|$|E

David Sims gave the episode an A, writing, [...] "George is really the most revolutionary character: he's often repulsive and pathetic, but here these are traits we heartily enjoy and sympathize with and want more of... The best <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> episode is that Jerry almost immediately getting with George's ex-girlfriend creates no drama in the group, though it would on almost any other sitcom." ...|$|E

[...] "....It was petrifying, but it put a stop to fantasies of being able to do anything. The oddest <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> job is the sense of superiority you get.

In the end, the 10-year peace treaty was finally completed, and the Byzantines also agreed to mention Adud al-Dawla's name in the Friday prayer in Constantinople.

David James Young, from Sputnikmusic, felt it was the best song on the album, [...] "the best <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> song is how damn {{infectious}} it is, thus making it an excellent pop song with top harmonies and a synth hook". Andrew Tijs from CitySearch Brisbane stated that it [...] "has the kind of breathless, carnivorous sexuality that Madonna still keeps trying to convince us she has", but it wasn't [...] "the sexual awakening that most have been waiting for [...] to have". For its lyrics, Evan Sawdey from PopMatters said [...] "Hook Me Up" [...] "sacrifice lyrical clarity {{for the sake of a}} good hook".|$|E
500|$|... "Badlaa" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban and {{inspired}} by stories of Indian fakirs. In fact, the episode's title means [...] "to retort" [...] or [...] "to revenge" [...] in Urdu. Further inspiration came [...] "from {{a little bit of}} desperation" [...] according to Shiban. He later recalled that he was walking through the Vancouver airport and suddenly had the thought, [...] "What if someone who {{came up to me and}} asked me for money was actually a bad guy." [...] Shiban later noted that his early drafts of the episode featured the antagonist with a different power. He explained, [...] "My original idea was a beggar with no legs who can actually shrink himself and climb inside your ear, and Chris Carter–and this is why he's Chris Carter–said 'No, no, no! I know what's even better.'" [...] Shiban later said that [...] "... one <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> episode that I'm sort of proud is that people often have told me that it is the most disgusting thought that they ever had, that this little man would actually enter your body and travel around inside you." ...|$|E

500|$|Steve Kandell of New York {{magazine}} {{said the}} episode felt like [...] "a {{bit of a}} place-holder" [...] compared to other episodes in the season, but that [...] "Woman of the Year" [...] included amusing scenes and introduced new ways to mock bureaucracy [...] "without every feeling like the sly satire it secretly is". Kandell also said he enjoyed the jokes at Leslie's and Jerry's expense. Kona Gallagher of TV Squad said every character was at their best, and that he particularly enjoyed Ron's taunting of Leslie once it was made clear he was only joking. Gallagher said the [...] "only <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> episode I didn't love" [...] {{was the way the}} subplot involving Tom's investment with the nightclub ended, because she felt it [...] "started off strong, but kind of went nowhere." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode was not a stand-out, but offered great character moments between Leslie and Ron. Fowler said Tom's desire to live like a hip hop mogul was funny [...] "but not always engaging", and that he enjoyed the [...] "little moments" [...] between Andy and April.|$|E
500|$|After {{seeing the}} {{portrayal}} of Yellowjacket in Ant-Man, the antagonist of the film, McMillian noted, It's hardly a secret that Marvel Studios {{has a bit of}} a problem when it comes to offering up exciting characters for their heroes to fight against ... villains generally fall into one of two camps. There's the Unstoppable Monster ... or there's the Professional White Guy In A Suit With An Ego ... No matter which of the groups the above villains fall into, they share one common purpose: evil. The motivations for evil likely differ—although, invariably, they fall under the umbrella of 'misguided belief in a greater good that doesn't exist'—but that really doesn't matter, because without fail, there will be so little time in the movie to actually properly explore those motivations, meaning that to all intents and purposes, the villain is being evil for reasons of plot necessity and little else ... The strange <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> is that Marvel's comic books offer a number of wonderful, colorful bad guys who could step outside the above parameters and offer an alternative to the formulaic villains audiences have gotten used to (and arguably bored with) ... In future movies, we can only hope [...] treated {{in such a way that}} their freak flags are allowed to fly free.|$|E
500|$|The book {{received}} mixed reviews. Caroline Foulkes {{wrote in}} The Birmingham Post: [...] "The <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> biography is the depths to which Taraborrelli has dug {{to get information}} on a famously controlling woman. He relates revealing anecdotes {{as if they were}} mere bagatelle, making News of the World style revelations look like kid's stuff. If Taraborrelli were to include in his list of acknowledgments 'thanks to the maid who let me into Madonna's bedroom to raid her underwear drawer', it wouldn't be any great surprise." [...] She also felt that [...] "despite the sensationalism, Taraborrelli's writing style lets him down. Too often it descends into the kind of mush you expect from an airport novel, with the singer coming across more like a character from Shirley Conran's Lace than a real woman." [...] Peter Sobczynski reviewed the book for the Post-Tribune and felt that [...] "the problem with writing an unauthorized tell-all biography is that, in this information-rich world that we live in, by the time a book gets written on somebody, most of the juicy stories are already common knowledge. To make up for that, the tell-all author needs to fill his or her pages with either a thoughtful analysis of the subject at hand, or, frankly, newer and better dirt. Unfortunately, celebrity biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli does neither with his latest concoction, Madonna: An Intimate Biography." ...|$|E

500|$|IGN's Eric Goldman {{felt that}} the episode's juggling of {{multiple}} storylines was [...] "satisfying", and that the scene in which Dexter prepares to kill Castillo was [...] "terrific". Though he praised Debra and Doakes' storyline with Tucci, he wrote that [...] "it was a bit disappointing to then see Deb be a bit too quickly vindicated at the end". Paula Paige, writing for TV Guide, said that the episode [...] "will go down in cable history as Dexters finest [...] to date". She was pleased with Debra's character development and the [...] "downright stylish" [...] cinematography, but thought that Jorge and Valerie's final, passionate words to each other were [...] "too much for me". Ray Ellis of Blogcritics believed that the episode [...] "takes the series into a more three-dimensional direction". He described the episode's subplots and themes as what [...] "make Dexter compelling", and wrote that Debra's character reached a more [...] "empathic level" [...] in the episode. TV Squad critic Keith McDuffee praised the increasing complexity of Dexter's relationship with his father through flashbacks, and thought that Dexter's voiceovers were [...] "the best <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> show". Jeff Lindsay, author of Darkly Dreaming Dexter upon which the show is based, was initially upset with the episode's plot.

The website's consensus reads, [...] "A move from New York to Hollywood gives Agent Carter new territory to explore, as the series continues {{to search for a}} storyline as dynamic as its heroine." [...] Mitchell Broussard at We Got This Covered graded the season premiere 4.5 out of 5 stars, calling it [...] "Fantastic" [...] and positively comparing it to Marvel's Ant-Man by saying [...] "Agent Carter finds a way to make the smaller stakes of Peggy's noir sandbox as tense, credible, and addictively watchable as any other addition to the MCU." [...] Broussard highlighted the performances of Atwell and D'Arcy as well as the new casting additions, and called the season's pacing, due to the small episode order, [...] "exciting". He noted that [...] "some may be disappointed in the more restrained adultness of the show releasing so soon after Jessica Jones, but I think that’s the greatest <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> world: each show feels different and its own thing, despite their close proximity." [...] Varietys Brian Lowry was less positive, praising the casting and performances but saying, [...] "Agent Carter feels too slavishly locked into the S.H.I.E.L.D. formula...it's sort of a shame Agent Carter isn’t more compelling, since the impeccable period trappings and costumes make the series a nice change of pace, at least visually." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of [...] "The Food Wife", HitFix's Alan Sepinwall commended it for [...] "stay true to the characters. Of course the kids would {{consider}} Homer to be the fun dad on those occasions when he's actually making an effort, and of course Marge would feel jealous of this. And if she goes too far in trying to keep this as her special thing, she also recognizes it immediately, feels guilty throughout the meal and then heads off to save the day, complete with a great homage to the climax of Ratatouille." [...] Sepinwall also praised the episode for being [...] "packed with great jokes", such as Heidecker and Wareheim's hip hop song and the scenes at the video game convention where the screen turns into a first-person shooter game. Similarly, Haydens Childs of The A.V. Club praised the episode as [...] "funny and well-observed", giving it a B+ grade, and cited the hip hop song as {{the highlight of the}} episode. He also praised Bourdain, Batali, and Ramsay, and stated that he wished Bourdain would have gotten a bigger part in the episode. Childs further wrote that [...] "The best <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> episode is that it doesn’t try to stuff any outlandish plot mechanics or out-of-character character moments down the viewers’ throats. It sticks to the basics: the family dynamic combined with gentle mocking of a still-current fad. I say 'still-current' because although it is probably true that food blogging is a bit past its expiration date in some cities, I don’t think that it has been overdone everywhere." ...|$|E
