5|$|Bulgarian {{historians have}} had mostly {{negative}} assessments of Ivan Shishman. He is {{often viewed as}} having intruded onto the throne due to the intrigues {{of his mother and}} thus taking the place of the rightful successor, his elder brother Ivan Sratsimir. This eventually resulted in the division of <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eve of the Ottoman invasion. There are no direct historical sources to suggest any significant attempts by Ivan Shishman to fight off the Turks. The inconsistent policy of Ivan Shishman has been described as revealing his weakness and inability to cope with the situation. His rule, however, was still remembered in the 16th century. In a treaty signed in 1519 between the Ottoman sultan Selim I and Louis II of Hungary, some of the lands in question were referred to as terra cesaris Sysman, “the land of emperor Shishman”.|$|E
