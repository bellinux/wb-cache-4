2500|$|Pomerol is {{well noted}} for the unassuming rural flavor {{that is a}} sharp {{contrast}} to the grand châteaux and ornate architecture that distinguishes many wine estates of the Médoc. Many of even the most distinguished estates are housed in what are often described as [...] "simple farm houses" [...] with very little exterior identification. As with much of Bordeaux, very few of the estates have tasting rooms and even fewer {{are open to the public}} without appointment. This is partly because the bulk of Pomerol wine is sold en primeur, allocated to exclusive distributors and clients shortly after harvest, leaving little to no wine to be sold through the <b>tasting</b> <b>room</b> door.|$|E
2500|$|In some of {{the better}} {{traditional}} markets, such as Coyoacán and San Juan in Mexico City, more handcrafted cheeses from small local farms can be found. [...] In Chihuahua, cheese is made with cattle descended from those the Spanish brought [...] and its production is still {{an important part of}} the culture. Most cheese-making there is most often carried out in the home or on ranches, where ranchers get up early to start the process by milking the cows and making queso ranchero, requesón, panela and others. Locally produced or handcrafted cheeses can be found in puestos de queseros or cheesemongers’ stalls, packed into baskets and wooden hoops, wrapped in corn husks, or pressed into flat, white, wide disks. Some specialty cheese producers have been invited to compete internationally. The Carlos Peraza family won a medal at the Cofradía de Quesos de Saint Maure in Touraine, France. In Baja California’s wine country, a notable cheese-making concern is La Cava de Marcelo. This business is named after owner Marcelo Castro Ramonetti, who is a fourth-generation cheese maker from a family who originally came to Mexico from Switzerland in 1911. The facility is located four meters below ground, measures 360 meters2 and is made of crystal and stone. It has been visited by food tourists from around the world, and featured on Internet sites such as chow.com.

2500|$|On New Years Day 2006, the Oakville winery {{experienced}} a major flood from the Napa River. The following month, on February 2, 2006, the Oakville winery was devastated by a fire which destroyed the dairy barn, the original structure on the property. At {{the time of}} the fire, the Duncan Family decided to rebuild the Oakville winery from the ground up. The rebuild began in 2007 and was completed in October 2008. President and CEO David Duncan said {{at the opening of the}} new Silver Oak Oakville winery, [...] "Though the fire was devastating, it presented us with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. We were able to take 35 years of experience in winemaking and hospitality and apply it to create an ideal space for making our Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon and entertaining our guests." [...] David Duncan said, [...] "The new winery is a winemaker's dream. We incorporated all the technological advancements of recent years into the winery's design but made sure we could accommodate changes down the line." [...] The rebuild included using some 550 tons of reclaimed stone from a 115-year-old dismantled mill in Coffeyville, Kansas, installing 1,464 solar panels to generate solar power for the facility, elevating the property 4.5 feet above the flood plain and moving their iconic water tower 12 feet. The Duncan Family was able to salvage the two stained glass windows in the original winery that had been created by local artist Diane Peterson in the theme of the Napa Valley. With the rebuild of the winery, they asked Diane Peterson to create two new stained glass windows. [...] Together, the windows represent the four seasons. In the <b>tasting</b> <b>room,</b> adjacent to the new tasting bar, built from white oak which had previously been a barn in Missouri, is a glass-house library displaying Silver Oak wines dating back to the 1970s.|$|E
