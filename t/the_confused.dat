It was arranged, composed, {{and produced}} by Kuti, who recorded the album after choosing to emphasize his African heritage and nationalism in his music.

Dean led the division for several weeks in unsuccessful delaying battles against the North Koreans, before he led his division in making a last stand at Taejon.

He remained in North Korean custody near P'yongyang {{for the remainder of the}} war. After the end of the conflict, Dean returned to the United States to a hero's welcome. He retired from the Army soon after and lived a quiet life until his death.|$|E
5|$|Despite Langdale's {{attempt to}} counter-charge, the Royalists were soon outflanked. With the Parliamentarian musketeers firing {{into the rear}} of Langdale's force, the Royalists broke, some {{escaping}} via Holt Bridge and others running towards Chester. On Hoole Heath these retreating soldiers met with part of Gerard's force and made an initially successful counter-attack before being forced back to the walls of Chester. There the retreating cavalry choked up the streets, allowing the Parliamentarian musketeers to fire into <b>the</b> <b>confused</b> mass of horsemen and leading to a rout.|$|E

5|$|Ship's {{regulations}} {{were designed to}} keep third class passengers confined to their area of the ship. The Titanic was fitted with grilles to prevent the classes from mingling and these gates were normally kept closed, although the stewards could open them {{in the event of}} an emergency.

5|$|With the {{commissioning}} of the Deutschland class, {{the fleet}} had enough battleships to form two full battle squadrons; the fleet was then reorganized into the High Seas Fleet, which saw combat during World War I. Despite their obsolescence, {{all five of}} these ships were present at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916. In <b>the</b> <b>confused</b> night actions, Pommern was torpedoed and sunk. After the battle, the four surviving ships {{were removed from the}} front-line fleet and employed in secondary tasks. The Treaty of Versailles permitted Germany to retain several old battleships for coastal defense, including the four Deutschland-class ships.|$|E
5|$|Of the British rear ships, {{only two}} made a {{determined}} effort {{to break the}} French line. Admiral Hood's flagship HMS Royal George pierced it between Républicain and Sans Pareil, engaging both closely, while HMS Glory came through the line behind Sans Pareil and threw herself into the melee as well. The rest of the British and French rearguard {{did not participate in}} this close combat; HMS Montagu fought a long range gunnery duel with Neptune which damaged neither ship severely, although the British captain James Montagu was killed in the opening exchanges, command devolving to Lieutenant Ross Donnelly. Next in line, HMS Ramillies ignored her opponent completely and sailed west, Captain Henry Harvey seeking Brunswick, his brother's ship, in <b>the</b> <b>confused</b> action around Queen Charlotte.|$|E

Mercer was trapped in a dugout and then stunned by a huge shell burst which wounded most of his staff and the officers of the battalion he was inspecting. The more badly wounded among the officers were transported to an underground field hospital but Mercer was left behind with wounded aide Captain Lynam Gooderham, and so was not present when the hospital was buried by the explosion of four mines which preceded a large-scale German attack. In <b>the</b> <b>confused</b> situation, Mercer and Gooderham attempted to escape the advancing enemy but inadvertently ran into crossfire, where Mercer's leg was broken by a bullet.|$|E

5|$|The Action of 3 February 1812 was {{an unusual}} minor naval {{engagement}} off the western coast of Haiti between a British frigate and a frigate manned by a loose coalition of Haitian rebels. The battle was fought {{against the background of}} the Napoleonic Wars and the collapse of government in Haiti {{in the aftermath of the}} Haitian Revolution eight years earlier. After the French had been expelled from Haiti in 1804, the newly independent nation was first ruled by Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who was murdered in 1806 and replaced by two of his advisors, Henri Christophe and Alexandre Pétion. These rulers divided the country between them and in <b>the</b> <b>confused</b> political situation that followed a number of minor fiefdoms appeared, including one led by Jérôme Maximilien Borgella in the south-west of the island called Sud.

5|$|The {{agreement}} {{to withdraw the}} special police and the JNA largely restored status quo ante bellum. 17 of the 32 arrested policemen returned to service by 5 March; charges were eventually filed against five, including Vezmar. The incident had a lasting significance {{because it was the}} first serious skirmish in what would become the Croatian War of Independencea full-scale war between Croatia and its rebel Serb population supported by Serbia and the JNA. The Serbian government used the Pakrac clash to strengthen nationalist propaganda claims that Croatia was committing genocide against its Serb population. Up to 40 deaths from the clash were reported by Serbian and Montenegrin media outlets. In an indication of <b>the</b> <b>confused</b> and highly inaccurate nature of the reporting, the Belgrade daily newspaper Večernje novosti reported on its front page that the town's Orthodox priest had been killed, on its second page that he had been wounded, and on its third page it printed a statement from him. The Yugoslav presidency finally issued a statement that nobody had been killed in Pakrac.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor and {{the rest}} of the {{excursion}} party attempt to reach the bridge but are repeatedly attacked by the ship's Angel Hosts, androids resembling angels who were programmed to supply information but are now eliminating all passengers and crew. Morvin falls off of a ledge into the ship's engine, {{and the rest}} of the group are surrounded by Angel Hosts. Bannakaffalatta reveals that he is a cyborg, and uses his internal EMP device to disable the Hosts. The EMP burst drains the Zocci's power cells and he dies. Mr. Copper takes the EMP device, saying that if they can manage to recharge it, they can use it against the Hosts again. A lone Angel Host attacks them again, and Foon ties herself to it and throws them both into the ship's engine. The Doctor separates from the rest and attempts to reach Deck 31, where he hopes to find the controls for the Heavenly Hosts. He convinces the Hosts that he is a stowaway - neither passenger nor crew and thus not in the Hosts' kill mandate - and <b>the</b> <b>confused</b> androids take him to see their operator, Max Capricorn. Max explains that he planned the Titanics inevitable collision with Earth to bankrupt the company that voted him out. To save the Doctor, Astrid uses a forklift to ram Max Capricorn and push him into the ship's engine. The forklift falls into the engine on top of him, seemingly killing Astrid as well.|$|E
