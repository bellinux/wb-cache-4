2500|$|Tallchief {{graduated}} from Beverly Hills High School in 1942. She {{had given up}} piano and {{wanted to go to}} college, but her father was against it.

2500|$|Baron Axel Carpelan, {{who gave}} Sibelius' {{well-known}} tone poem Finlandia its name, {{wrote to the}} composer shortly after its successful premiere: [...] "You have been sitting at home for quite a while, Mr. Sibelius, it is high <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> travel. You will spend the late autumn and the winter in Italy, a country where one learns cantabile, balance and harmony, plasticity and symmetry of lines, a country where everything is beautiful – even the ugly. You remember what Italy meant for Tchaikovsky’s development and for Richard Strauss." [...] Although Baron Carpelan was penniless, he raised sufficient funds for Sibelius {{to stay in a}} mountain villa near Rapallo, Italy. Here, Sibelius jotted down the first notes to his second symphony.|$|E
2500|$|By 1846 Bourget {{found that}} many of his plans for {{expansion}} and renovation of the Roman Catholic Church in Canada were being frustrated by Archbishop Signay, who disliked Bourget and was distrustful of Bourget's changes. [...] On September 25, 1846, Bourget wrote to Signay and said, “For a long time I have been thinking that Your Grace should give up the administration of your archdiocese, contenting yourself with retaining the title of metropolitan. I shall use the occasion of my journey to Rome to put before the Holy See the reasons leading me to believe that it might be <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> relieve yourself of this burden." [...] With this in mind, Bourget travelled to Rome in late 1846 to petition the Pope for Signay's resignation. [...] He was supported in this cause by Charles-Félix Cazeau, secretary to Archbishop Signay.|$|E
2500|$|The song is one out {{of three}} Elliott-produced records on After the Storm, {{commissioned}} by J Records head and executive producer Clive Davis after the release of Elliott's acclaimed studio album Under Construction (2002) and the delay of Monica's original third studio album All Eyez on Me the year before. It was conceived during a studio session week in Miami in early 2003, and was produced as a sequel to [...] "So Gone," [...] another Elliott track. In an interview with MTV News at the 2003 BET Awards, Monica stated that [...] "'Knock Knock' is [...] like a follow-up to 'So Gone,' just saying that, 'All right, we went through all that stuff, now it's <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> get lost. This {{is the end of the}} road for you.' So, it's kind of like a 'get back' record." [...] Commenting on the recording process, she added: [...] "She [...] doesn't have any fear [...] When she goes in the studio, her goal is to be creative and to give something new and she could care less what else is current. And she creates new trends by doing that." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 27 January 2011, Mohammed ElBaradei {{returned}} to Egypt amid ongoing turmoil. He declared himself ready {{to lead a}} transitional government {{if that was the}} will of the nation, saying that: [...] "If [...] want me to lead the transition, I will not let them down". He called for ousting the regime, as in Tunisia. Subsequently, [...] "when he joined protesters Friday after noon prayers, police fired water cannons at him and his supporters. They used batons to beat some of ElBaradei's supporters, who surrounded him to protect him." [...] ElBaradei said he was [...] "proud of the protesters" [...] and proud of the military, who by 29 January were the only state force on the streets of Cairo, with police nowhere to be seen. There were numerous individual public displays of affection and respect for soldiers manning positions on the streets. He urged the US to end the [...] "life support to the dictator" [...] and that [...] "It is better for President Obama not to appear that he is the last one to say to President Mubarak, 'It's <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> go.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Game Boy Advance {{version was}} {{generally}} considered the weakest {{version of the}} game. IGN's Marc Nix scored it 6 out of 10, and was especially critical of the combat; [...] "enemies get the jump on you with the first attack, and since there can be several enemies on screen, it can {{take a long time}} for your turn to come up. Then you have to watch every swipe of battle, which all begin and end with the characters taking a LONG walk across the screen to attack and then retreat - just the time that it takes for sprites to rotate back into the ready position is enough <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> lose interest." [...] He called the game [...] "a rough start for the journey." [...] GameSpy's Avi Fryman scored it 1.5 out of 5, criticizing the graphics, and finding the game buggy, writing [...] "I wonder if it was even tested prior to its clearly rushed release." [...] GameSpot's Frank Provo scored it 2.1 out of 10, writing, [...] "the range of interactivity is so low and the action is so infrequent that Frodo's quest to Mount Doom is reduced to nothing more than a trivial errand. What's more, the entire game is so unpolished and full of bugs that it's unfathomable how it ever passed quality assurance in the first place." ...|$|E
