However, in practice, the collateral would not protect fully against losses both because protection sellers would not be required <b>to</b> <b>post</b> <b>collateral</b> that covered the complete loss during a bankruptcy and because the value of the collateral would be highly uncertain following the repercussions of an AIG bankruptcy.

This paper models such a case in the framework of a hedge fund. Specifically, Long Term Capital Management is presented as a case study. In particular, we calculate the likelihood of hedge fund failure and survival given different statistical arbitrage opportunities and hedge fund risk management decisions. Dynamic relationships between a hedge fund, dealer, and market (investor) are modeled. The model explores phenomenon when a fund manager who engages in arbitrage and uses high leverage might lose all his money before realizing positions at a profit. As assets go down in value, the firm has <b>to</b> <b>post</b> more <b>collateral</b> or decrease position exposure. We observe if positions converge before all collateral has been exhausted, the most profitable strategy is <b>to</b> <b>post</b> more <b>collateral</b> and increase position exposure.

5000|$|Collateral {{management}} is {{the method of}} granting, verifying, and giving advice on collateral transactions {{in order to reduce}} credit risk in unsecured financial transactions. The fundamental idea of collateral {{management is}} very simple, that is cash or securities are passed from one counterparty to another as security for a credit exposure. [...] In a swap transaction between parties A and B, party A makes a mark-to-market (MtM) profit whilst party B makes a corresponding MtM loss. Party B then presents some form of collateral to party A to mitigate the credit exposure that arises due to positive MtM. The form of collateral is agreed before initiation of the contract. Collateral agreements are often bilateral. Collateral has to be returned or posted in the opposite direction when exposure decreases. In the case of a positive MtM, an institution calls for collateral {{and in the case of}} a negative MtM they have <b>to</b> <b>post</b> <b>collateral.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{study found}} that {{collateral}} requirements influence access to finance by SMEs in Mozambique.

This finding is in line with the findings of Mullei and Bokea (2000) that banks ask for collaterals in order to finance SMEs and to accept loan proposal and that the collateral must therefore be 100  % or more, equal to the amount of credit extension or finance product.|$|R

The informational advantage of informal lenders is portrayed as the ability to monitor borrowers. Monitoring reduces the incentive problem and allows for contracts with lower collateral. This enables informal lenders to serve two types of clients: 1) Those who cannot post the collateral required by the formal sector; and 2) Those who are able but do not want <b>to</b> <b>post</b> <b>collateral.</b> The model is thus consistent with the conventional view of the informal sector as recipient of spillover demand (quantity rationed) from the formal sector. It also demonstrates an additional role of the informal sector- namely as provider of insurance as the lower collateral requirement implies greater consumption smoothing across states of nature...|$|E

50|$|During 2008, {{three of}} the largest U.S. {{investment}} banks either went bankrupt (Lehman Brothers) or were sold at fire sale prices to other banks (Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch). The investment banks were {{not subject to the}} more stringent regulations applied to depository banks. These failures exacerbated the instability in the global financial system. The remaining two investment banks, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, potentially facing failure, opted to become commercial banks, thereby subjecting themselves to more stringent regulation but receiving access to credit via the Federal Reserve. Further, American International Group (AIG) had insured mortgage-backed and other securities but was not required to maintain sufficient reserves to pay its obligations when debtors defaulted on these securities. AIG was contractually required <b>to</b> <b>post</b> additional <b>collateral</b> with many creditors and counter-parties, touching off controversy when over $100 billion of U.S. taxpayer money was paid out to major global financial institutions on behalf of AIG.

However, the superimposition of both leverage and induced high correlation between assets can lead to a collapse. The paper explores these “flight to quality ” and “collateral collapse ” dynamics...|$|R
40|$|A {{large body}} of {{literature}} has shown that small firms experience difficulties in accessing the credit market due to informational asymmetries. Banks can overcome these asymmetries through relationship lending, or at least mitigate their effects by asking for collateral. Small firms, {{especially if they are}} young, have little collateral and short credit histories, and thus may find it difficult to raise funds from banks. In this paper, we show that even in this case, small firms may improve their borrowing capacity by joining Mutual Guarantee Institutions (MGI). Our empirical analysis shows that small firms affiliated to MGIs pay less for credit compared with similar firms. We obtain this result for interest rates charged on loan contracts which are not backed by mutual guarantees. We then argue that our findings are consistent with the view that MGIs are better at screening and monitoring opaque borrowers than banks are. Thus, banks benefit from the willingness of MGIs <b>to</b> <b>post</b> <b>collateral</b> since this implies that firms are better screened and monitored.

40|$|A {{large body}} of {{literature}} has shown that small firms, due to their opaqueness, may {{find it difficult to}} access the credit market. Informational asymmetries may be mitigated by posting collateral or by building relationships with lenders (relationship lending). However, in some cases, {{due to a lack of}} collateral or of a long credit history, small enterprises may still find it very difficult to raise external finance unless alternative contracting schemes emerge. In particular, group lending or similarly micro-finance are examples of such alternative lending contracts. In this paper, we investigate the effect of mutual guarantee institutions (MGI) on loan interest rates. We argue that, similarly to group lending and micro-finance, firms affiliated to a MGI are linked by a joint responsibility for the loan providing MGI affiliates with peer monitoring incentives. Indeed, each MGI member contributes to the guarantee fund that is then posted as collateral to loans granted to MGI members. As a consequence, MGI willingness <b>to</b> <b>post</b> <b>collateral</b> signals firms creditworthiness to banks. The econometric analysis supports the hypothesis that these consortia improve lending conditions for small firms. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{extent to}} which bank lending {{policies}} - and in particular their requirement for firms <b>to</b> <b>post</b> <b>collateral</b> - have imposed constraints {{on the ability of}} unincorporated businesses to meet their demand for debt finance has been examined. It was found that for the period from 1982 through {{to the end of the}} data sample, variations in the level of bank lending to unincorporated businesses can be explained in terms of a more or less conventional demand function for bank finance - albeit one with a zero interest elasticity - though there is some evidence of the importance of collateral constraints in the shape of a significant positive effect from the growth in the real value of housing wealth. Prior to 1982 there was a sharp increase in the level of bank lending to unincorporated businesses which is much harder to interpret in these terms. Instead, this is seen as having been driven largely by changes in bank lending policies; in particular, by a drive to develop new markets in response to unfavourable conditions in their traditional lending markets. ...|$|E

[...] The AIG Financial Products division, headed by Joseph Cassano, in London, had entered into credit default swaps to insure $441 billion worth of securities originally rated AAA. Of those securities, $57.8 billion were structured debt securities backed by subprime loans. As a result, AIG’s credit rating was downgraded and it was required <b>to</b> <b>post</b> additional <b>collateral</b> with its trading counter-parties, leading to a liquidity crisis that began on September 16, 2008, and essentially bankrupted all of AIG. The United States Federal Reserve Bank stepped in, announcing the creation of a secured credit facility of up to US$85 billion to prevent the company's collapse, enabling AIG to deliver additional collateral to its credit default swap trading partners. The credit facility was secured by the stock in AIG-owned subsidiaries {{in the form of}} warrants for a 79.9% equity stake in the company and the right to suspend dividends to previously issued common and preferred stock.
