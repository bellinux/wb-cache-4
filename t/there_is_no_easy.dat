25|$|In 2011 China was {{the largest}} {{producer}} of steel in the world producing 45% of the world's steel, 683milliontons, an increase of 9% from 2010. 6 of 10 of largest steel producers {{in the world are}} in China. Profits are low despite continued high demand due to high debt and overproduction of high end products produced with the equipment financed by the high debt. The central government is aware of this problem but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>easy</b> way to resolve it as local governments strongly support local steel production. Meanwhile, each firm aggressively increases production. Iron ore production kept pace with steel production in the early 1990s but was soon outpaced by imported iron ore and other metals in the early 2000s. Steel production, an estimated 140milliontons in 2000 increased to 419milliontons in 2006. Much of the country's steel output comes from a large number of small-scale producing centers, one of the largest being Anshan in Liaoning.|$|E

500|$|Measure for Measure has {{frequently}} {{been considered a}} [...] "problem play". It was a problem for Hazlitt in that it contains almost no character with whom one can feel complete sympathy. [...] "here is in general a want of passion; the affections are at a stand; our sympathies are reflected and defeated in all directions." [...] Angelo, the Deputy ruler of Vienna, is forgiven by the Duke but draws only Hazlitt's hatred, as [...] "he {{seems to have a}} much greater passion for hypocrisy than for his mistress." [...] "Neither are we enamoured of Isabella's rigid chastity, though she could not act otherwise than she did." [...] Isabella's brother Claudio [...] "is the only person who feels naturally", yet even he does not show well in his pleading for life at the sacrifice of his sister's virginity. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>easy</b> solution for his plight, and [...] "he is placed in circumstances of distress which almost preclude the wish for his deliverance." [...] Over a century later, commentator R.W. Chambers placed Hazlitt as the first of a long line of notable Shakespearean critics who felt the same way, and he quoted Characters of Shakespear's Plays in establishing his contention (as a basis for arguing his own different view of the play) that Hazlitt was among the first of dozens of distinguished critics who could not comprehend how Mariana could love and plead for someone like Angelo, and in general showed a distaste for much in Measure for Measure.|$|E
500|$|One {{measure of}} cable {{manufacturing}} and installation quality is how closely the characteristic impedance adheres to the nominal impedance along its length. [...] Impedance {{changes can be}} caused by variations in geometry along the cable length. [...] In turn, these {{can be caused by}} a faulty manufacturing process or by faulty installation (such as not observing limits on bend radii). [...] Unfortunately, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>easy,</b> non-destructive method of directly measuring impedance along a cable's length. [...] It can, however, be indicated indirectly by measuring reflections, that is, return loss. [...] Return loss by itself does not reveal much, since the cable design will have some intrinsic return loss anyway due to not having a purely resistive characteristic impedance. [...] The technique used is to carefully adjust the cable termination to obtain as close a match as possible and then to measure the variation of return loss with frequency. [...] The minimum return loss so measured is called the structural return loss (SRL). [...] SRL is a measure of a cables' adherence to its nominal impedance {{but it is not a}} direct correspondence, errors further from the generator have less effect on SRL than those close to it. [...] The measurement must also be carried out at all in-band frequencies to be significant. [...] The reason for this is that equally spaced errors introduced by the manufacturing process will cancel and be invisible, or at least much reduced, at certain frequencies due to quarter wave impedance transformer action.|$|E

2500|$|Links {{are created}} using a {{specific}} syntax, the so-called [...] "link pattern". Originally, most wikis used CamelCase to name pages and create links. These {{are produced by}} capitalizing words in a phrase and removing the spaces between them (the word [...] "CamelCase" [...] is itself an example). While CamelCase makes linking easy, it also leads to links {{in a form that}} deviates from the standard spelling. To link to a page with a single-word title, one must abnormally capitalize one of the letters in the word (e.g. [...] "WiKi" [...] instead of [...] "Wiki"). CamelCase-based wikis are instantly recognizable because they have many links with names such as [...] "TableOfContents" [...] and [...] "BeginnerQuestions." [...] It is possible for a wiki to render the visible anchor of such links [...] "pretty" [...] by reinserting spaces, and possibly also reverting to lower case. However, this reprocessing of the link to improve the readability of the anchor is limited by the loss of capitalization information caused by CamelCase reversal. For example, [...] "RichardWagner" [...] should be rendered as [...] "Richard Wagner", whereas [...] "PopularMusic" [...] should be rendered as [...] "popular music". <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>easy</b> way to determine which capital letters should remain capitalized. As a result, many wikis now have [...] "free linking" [...] using brackets, and some disable CamelCase by default.|$|E
