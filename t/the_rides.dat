5|$|A montage shows {{visitors}} on <b>the</b> <b>rides</b> at Walt Disney World Resort and {{the many}} visuals and animatronics that accompany <b>the</b> <b>rides.</b> It ends with a man losing his head while riding Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. On {{the last day of}} a family vacation at Walt Disney World, Jim White gets fired by his boss during a phone call on the balcony of the Contemporary Resort Hotel with his family. He keeps the news to himself to avoid spoiling their vacation. The family leaves their room and takes the monorail to the park, alongside two French teenagers, Isabelle and Sophie.|$|E
5|$|Under the Macdonalds, {{the park}} {{continued}} to expand. Kiddieland was constructed between 1954 and 1956, and featured many smaller version of rides meant for children. Some of <b>the</b> <b>rides</b> included miniature boats, a Ferris wheel, doodlebug, and pony rides.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, {{almost all}} <b>the</b> <b>rides</b> were renamed: Dragon Fyre, Wilde Beast, Quixote's Kettles, Wilde Night Mares, and Viking's Rage became Dragon Fire, Wild Beast, Spinovator, Nightmares, and The Rage. When {{the park was}} sold to Cedar Fair, Paramount-specific ride names {{disappeared}} with Cliffhanger, Drop Zone becoming Riptide, Drop Tower, respectively.|$|E
50|$|In 1871, Arthur Sturgis Hardy won <b>the</b> <b>riding.</b> He held {{it until}} his death in 1889. Thomas H. Preston held <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> from 1899 until 1908. Willoughby Staples Brewster held <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> from 1908 until 1914. Joseph Henry Ham held <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> from 1914 until 1919. Morrison Mann MacBride held <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> from 1919 until 1923, when <b>the</b> provincial <b>riding</b> became <b>the</b> Brantford <b>riding</b> in 1923.|$|R
50|$|During the {{duration}} of <b>the</b> <b>ride,</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> changes speeds. When <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> is fluctuating in its wavelike manner, the person will feel like <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> is not going that fast. However, when <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> is almost over, the person will feel forces on their body, and get pushed toward {{the outside of the}} cars. This happens when <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> starts lowering to the ground in a non-wavelike manner. When <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> moves in this way, it acts like a Himalaya / Musik Express ride.|$|R
25|$|On May 27, 2016, several {{passengers}} {{boarded the}} White Water Landing <b>ride.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> operator was {{not paying attention}} and started <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> without putting <b>the</b> restraint bars down. As the raft ascended the lift hill, the onboard guests started to panic and started yelling at <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> operators. One of the passengers stood up, trying to get <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> operator's attention. Soon after this, one of <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> operators realized what was going on, and stopped <b>the</b> <b>ride.</b> <b>The</b> same <b>ride</b> operator jumped onto the catwalk, and closed the restraints through a panel. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> went through <b>the</b> layout normally. No injuries were reported, but some guests were shaken up. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> operated normally {{for the rest of}} the day.|$|R
5|$|During the 2012 season, {{all of the}} WindSeekers except Kings Island's {{experienced}} {{incidents in}} which the ride stopped, stranding riders in the air. Two such incidents occurred in September at Knott's Berry Farm, in one case leaving riders stranded {{at the top of}} the ride for nearly four hours, prompting the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration to order the ride shut down indefinitely on September 19 pending investigation of both the length of time riders were stranded and the actual causes of the incidents. Two days later on September 21, Cedar Fair announced the closure of all other WindSeekers to conduct an internal review. The company said that until the review concludes, none of <b>the</b> <b>rides</b> would operate again. <b>The</b> <b>rides</b> remained closed through the remainder of the 2012 season at the five seasonal parks but reopened at all parks in 2013, excluding Knott's Berry Farm's version which has been relocated.|$|E
5|$|Chang {{was removed}} {{over the weekend}} of September 19, 2009 to expand Splashwater Kingdom, but the {{expansion}} was soon rejected, while Six Flags later announced plans to dispose of its Kentucky Kingdom property. The removal of Chang and the closure of Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom caused {{the owners of the}} park land (the Kentucky State Fair Board) to sue Six Flags for ownership of <b>the</b> <b>rides.</b> Kentucky Kingdom is now open under new operators as of May 24, 2014.|$|E
5|$|For safety, Canada's Wonderland uses a ride {{rating system}} that classifies the attractions {{based on the}} {{intensity}} of the ride. The ratings vary from 1, for rides that are calm and gentle, to 5, for rides that have high speeds, aggressive forces, and rapid elevation changes. A separate set of ride ratings criteria is used for attractions inside Splash Works, though <b>the</b> <b>rides</b> are still rated on a scale from 1 to 5.|$|E
50|$|Tidal Wave is a Shoot-the-Chutes water ride at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> {{is located}} in the Movie District portion of <b>the</b> park. <b>The</b> <b>ride's</b> theme is related to a {{tropical}} environment featuring several palms and trees. The entrance to <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> is next to The Riddler's Revenge which is near to JB's Smokehouse BBQ. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> is open from the spring season to late September. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> temporarily closes in early October for Magic Mountain's annual Fright Fest event; <b>the</b> <b>ride's</b> line is used for a maze. During the winter months, <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> is closed to drain the water and clean <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> along with <b>the</b> splash area. The entrance to the Flash Pass is located at the right side exit of <b>the</b> <b>ride.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> has two large boats which seat a maximum of 20 riders. Both of the boats are typically used every day.|$|R
50|$|Fire {{destroyed}} part of <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> in 1949 and {{the structure}} required major repairs. Replacement timber for <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> was bought from the dismantled pier at Lowestoft and <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> re-opened in 1950. Fire again destroyed parts of <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> in 1957.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>riding</b> {{was created}} for the 2004 {{election}} by merging 50% of <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> of York North with 24% of <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> of Vaughan—King—Aurora.|$|R
5|$|In August 2007, {{rumors of}} Dominator being {{relocated}} to Kings Dominion surfaced. On September 21, 2007, Cedar Fair announced that Geauga Lake {{would no longer}} operate as a traditional amusement park, and instead become solely a waterpark, Wildwater Kingdom. As a result, September 16, 2007 was the last day the ride would operate at Geauga Lake. With that announcement, <b>the</b> <b>rides</b> from the amusement park side began to be relocated to other Cedar Fair properties. The new location of Dominator, however, was not released.|$|E
5|$|John Henry Iles, {{who took}} over control of Belle Vue in 1925, {{believed}} that expansion of <b>the</b> <b>rides</b> and the fun aspect of the park was the way forward, and added attractions such as dodgems, the Caterpillar, the Ghost Train, Jack & Jill, and the Flying Sea Planes. The Scenic Railway, purchased in 1925 but not fully operational until two years later, proved {{to be one of}} Belle Vue's most popular rides, and remained in use until 1975.|$|E
5|$|The Morris {{family and}} their friend become lost, accidentally finding the HorrorLand theme park. Shortly after parking, their car explodes, but the ticket-taker reassures them {{that it will be}} taken care of. The children, Lizzy Morris, Luke Morris, and their friend Clay, explore the theme park and get on <b>the</b> <b>rides.</b> After a ride in which Lizzy is locked in a casket {{traveling}} down a river, the three of them attempt to convince the parents that they all should leave. The parents reveal that they experienced similar problems, so they all decide to confront the Horrors.|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> <b>ride,</b> guests proceed past an {{observation}} deck for <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> and past <b>the</b> <b>ride's</b> former gift shop where they arrive back in Chinatown.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ride</b> {{operator}} {{is located}} in the center of <b>the</b> <b>ride.</b> Part of <b>the</b> operator's duty is to control lighting and music in addition to <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> itself. Some variants include closed-circuit television cameras, allowing waiting riders and passersby to observe <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> in action.|$|R
5|$|On September 1, 2005, {{the park}} officially {{announced}} Goliath, a $20,000,000 steel Hyper Coaster. By {{the end of}} the 2005 season, <b>the</b> <b>rides</b> Great Gasp and Looping Starship were closed and removed from the park {{to make room for the}} new roller coaster. Foundations for Goliath's supports began to be poured in September 2005. In early October, track began to arrive at the park; erection of the supports and track began soon after. In November and December, construction on the lift hill was complete. In March 2006, Goliath's trains were delivered to the park. After construction on the track and testing was complete, the roller coaster opened to the public on April 1, 2006.|$|E
5|$|Brady and Hindley {{visited a}} {{fairground}} on 26 December 1964, {{in search of}} another victim, and noticed 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey standing beside one of <b>the</b> <b>rides.</b> When {{it became apparent that}} she was on her own, they approached her and deliberately dropped some of the shopping they were carrying close to her, before asking for the girl's help to carry some of the packages to their car, and then to their home. Once inside the house Downey was undressed, gagged and forced to pose for photographs before being raped and killed, perhaps strangled with a piece of string. Hindley maintained that she went to fill a bath for the child and found the girl dead (presumably killed by Brady) when she returned. In Chris Cowley's book Face to Face with Evil: Conversations with Ian Brady, Brady states that it was Hindley who killed Downey. The following morning Brady and Hindley drove with Downey's body to Saddleworth Moor, where she was buried, naked with her clothes at her feet, in a shallow grave.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with a free}} plot {{of land in the}} United Kingdom and {{few hundred}} {{thousand}} pounds, the player must build a profitable amusement park. Money is spent on building rides, shops, and staff, and earned through sale of entry tickets, merchandise, and refreshments. Shops available include those selling foodstuff (such as ice creams) or soft drinks, and games such as coconut shies and arcades. Their attributes can be customised, which may affect customers' behaviour: for example, affecting the flavour of foods (e.g. by altering the amount of sugar and ice cream contains) may affect customers' enticements to return. Facilities such as toilets, and items that enhance the park's scenery (such as trees and fountains) can be purchased. Over thirty attractions, ranging in complexity from the bouncy castle and tree house to more complicated and expensive rides such as the roller coaster and Ferris wheel are available. Also available as rides are shows (called 'acts') with themes such as clowns and mediaeval. Certain rides, such as roller coasters, require a track to be laid out. The ride complement varies between platforms: for example, the PlayStation version is missing the mediaeval and dolphin shows. Rides require regular maintenance: if neglected for too long they will explode. Depending on the platform, it is possible to tour the park or <b>the</b> <b>rides.</b>|$|E
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> {{was first}} opened during the 2003 season, <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> {{attracted}} lots of guest and {{had almost no}} problems. As of {{the last couple of}} years, <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> has been hampered with so many problems that it has been almost impossible to say when <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> would be open. Canada's Wonderland has not stated exactly what is causing all the problems with <b>the</b> <b>ride.</b>|$|R
50|$|Between 2012 and 2014, Slammer at Thorpe Park {{went through}} major downtime. All signage for <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> was removed {{at the end}} of 2012 which gave the {{impression}} that Thorpe Park weren't planning to open <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> anytime soon. For Fright Nights in 2013, <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> was completely removed from the actual park map which suggested <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> was going to close. However, {{at the start of the}} 2014 season, <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> could be seen testing with sand filled dummies which suggested <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> would open again.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>riding</b> {{was divided}} between the rural and urban parts.

50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>ride,</b> up to {{two people}} sit in one of 20 gondolas {{arranged}} in a circle, one in front of <b>the</b> other. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> moves clockwise, dispelling a slight amount of centrifugal force.

25|$|Starting at {{the main}} entry, the tour guide {{explained}} the general history of the attraction and some anecdotes regarding the large model ships and items in the museum. As the guests were guided to the corridor housing the ride queues, they went backstage for the first time. Throughout the tour guests were taken {{through a series of}} backstage areas such as wardrobe and makeup, and were also given the opportunity to explore the sets used for <b>the</b> <b>rides,</b> allowing them more time to more thoroughly examine the details than allowed during <b>the</b> <b>rides</b> and revealing some of the secrets of how the show was operated to allow guests to become lost {{in the world of the}} 24th century.|$|E
