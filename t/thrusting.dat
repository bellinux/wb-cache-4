Agonistic behaviour consists of <b>thrusting</b> and snapping at opponents with their bills, or lifting and waving their wings in a threatening manner. Adult pelicans grunt when at the colony, but are generally silent elsewhere or outside breeding season. Conversely, colonies are noisy as chicks vocalise extensively.|$|E

Unlike most murids, copulatory behavior lacks intravaginal <b>thrusting,</b> the intromission thrust is more intense than the dismount, there is no lock, and ejaculation occurs with every thrust.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} space-related {{application of}} americium is a fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion. It {{relies on the}} very high rate of nuclear fission of 242mAm, which can be maintained even in a micrometer-thick foil. Small thickness avoids the problem of self-absorption of emitted radiation. This problem is pertinent to uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles. The fission products of 242mAm can either directly propel the spaceship or they can heat up a <b>thrusting</b> gas; they can also transfer their energy to a fluid and generate electricity through a magnetohydrodynamic generator.|$|E

50|$|Focusing on the {{southern}} portion of the Sevier <b>thrust</b> belt many <b>thrust</b> faults can be found. One <b>thrust</b> system {{is known as the}} Garden Valley <b>thrust</b> system in the central Nevada <b>thrust</b> belt. <b>Thrusts</b> within this system include the Pahranagat, Mount Irish, and Golden Gate <b>thrusts.</b> These <b>thrusts</b> were correlated with the southward Gass Peak <b>thrust.</b> The Gass Peak <b>thrust</b> is located in the Las Vegas Range and is a Sevier age structure. This <b>thrust</b> may have been responsible for the largest slip of the major belt along that latitude. These <b>thrusts</b> were located all along the same strike. This region showed small scale extension in the Cenozoic due to reactivation of the <b>thrusts.</b> Such a correlation suggests that the Garden Valley <b>thrust</b> system has a direct link to the Sevier <b>thrust</b> belt. The interpretation of this data led to the central Nevada <b>thrust</b> belt as being an interior section of the Sevier. This correlation provides evidence that the Sevier <b>thrust</b> belt was a result of compression moving eastward through the North American plate.|$|R
5000|$|Fold and <b>thrust</b> belts {{are formed}} {{of a series}} of sub-parallel <b>thrust</b> sheets, {{separated}} by major <b>thrust</b> faults. As the total shortening increases in a fold and <b>thrust</b> belt, the belt propagates into its foreland.

5|$|Lobatus gigas has {{an unusual}} means of locomotion, first {{described}} in 1922 by George Howard Parker (1864–1955). The animal first fixes the posterior {{end of the}} foot by <b>thrusting</b> {{the point of the}} sickle-shaped operculum into the substrate, then it extends the foot in a forward direction, lifting and throwing the shell forward in a so-called leaping motion. This way of moving is considered to resemble that of pole vaulting, making L.gigas a good climber even of vertical concrete surfaces. This leaping locomotion may help prevent predators from following the snail's chemical traces, which would otherwise leave a continuous trail on the substrate.|$|E
5|$|Rome's forces used typical Roman {{equipment}} including pila (heavy javelins) and hastae (<b>thrusting</b> spears) {{as weapons}} {{as well as}} traditional helmets, shields and body armor. On the other hand, the Carthaginian army {{used a variety of}} equipment. The Iberians fought with swords suited for cutting and <b>thrusting,</b> as well as javelins and various types of spears. For defense, Iberian warriors carried large oval shields and the falcata. The Gauls were likely wearing no armor, and the typical Gallic weapon was usually a long, slashing sword. The heavy Carthaginian cavalry carried two javelins and a curved slashing sword, with a heavy shield for protection. The Numidian cavalry were very lightly equipped, lacking saddles and bridles for their horses, and used no armor but carried small shields, javelins and possibly a knife or longer blade. Skirmishers acting as light infantry carried either slings or spears. The Balearic slingers, who were famous for their accuracy, carried short, medium and long slings used to cast stones or bullets. They may have carried a small shield or simple leather pelt on their arms, but this is uncertain. Hannibal himself was wearing musculata armor and carried a falcata as well.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} test the {{feasibility}} of a new <b>thrust</b> stand system based on impulse <b>thrust</b> measurement method, a liquid-fueled pulse detonation engine (PDE) is designed and built. <b>Thrust</b> performance of the engine is obtained by direct <b>thrust</b> measurement with a force transducer and indirect <b>thrust</b> measurement with an eddy current displacement sensor (ECDS). These two sets of <b>thrust</b> data are compared {{with each other to}} verify the accuracy of the <b>thrust</b> performance. Then <b>thrust</b> data measured by the new <b>thrust</b> stand system are compared with the verified <b>thrust</b> data to test its feasibility. The results indicate that <b>thrust</b> data from the force transducer and ECDS system are consistent with each other within the range of measurement error. Though the <b>thrust</b> data from the impulse <b>thrust</b> measurement system is a litter lower than that from the force transducer due to the axial momentum losses of the detonation jet, the impulse <b>thrust</b> measurement method is valid when applied to measure the averaged <b>thrust</b> of PDE. Analytical models of PDE are also discussed in this paper. The analytical <b>thrust</b> performance is higher than the experimental data due to ignoring the losses during the deflagration to detonation transition process. Effect of equivalence ratio on the engine <b>thrust</b> performance is investigated by utilizing the modified analytical model. <b>Thrust</b> reaches maximum at the equivalence ratio of about 1. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Target-type <b>thrust</b> reversal, {{particularly}} this design, {{was invented}} in 1968. This invention is stated to be an improvement to previous design.

5|$|Each legion was {{normally}} {{partnered with}} an approximately {{equal number of}} allied (non-Roman) auxiliae troops. The addition of allied troops to the Roman army was a formalisation of the earlier arrangement of using light troops from the Socii and Latini, who had received Roman citizenship after the Social War. Auxiliary troops could be formed from either auxiliary light cavalry known as alae, auxiliary light infantry known as cohors auxiliae, or a flexible mixture of the two known as cohors equitata. Cavalry types included mounted archers (Latin: sagittarii) and heavy shock cavalry (Latin: cataphracti or clibanarii). Infantry could be armed with bows, slings, throwing spears, long swords, or <b>thrusting</b> spears. Auxiliary units were originally led by their own chiefs, and, in this period, their internal organisation was left to their commanders.|$|E
5|$|Many {{amphibians}} {{catch their}} prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with a sticky tip and drawing {{it back into}} the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws. Some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey, repeatedly <b>thrusting</b> their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by inertia. Most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs. The short oesophagus is lined with cilia that help to move the food to the stomach and mucus produced by glands in the mouth and pharynx eases its passage. The enzyme chitinase produced in the stomach helps digest the chitinous cuticle of arthropod prey.|$|E

The innovative <b>thrust</b> reverser configurations consisted of a cascade <b>thrust</b> reverser with porous fan-duct blocker, a blockerless <b>thrust</b> reverser, two core-mounted target <b>thrust</b> reversers, a multi-door crocodile <b>thrust</b> reverser, and a wing-mounted <b>thrust</b> reverser.

5|$|Phreatic {{eruption}}s (or steam-blast eruptions) are {{a type of}} eruption {{driven by}} the expansion of steam. When cold ground or surface water {{come into contact with}} hot rock or magma it superheats and explodes, fracturing the surrounding rock and <b>thrusting</b> out a mixture of steam, water, ash, volcanic bombs, and volcanic blocks. The distinguishing feature of phreatic explosions is that they only blast out fragments of pre-existing solid rock from the volcanic conduit; no new magma is erupted. Because they are driven by the cracking of rock strata under pressure, phreatic activity does not always result in an eruption; if the rock face is strong enough to withstand the explosive force, outright eruptions may not occur, although cracks in the rock will probably develop and weaken it, furthering future eruptions.|$|E
5|$|The German plan {{of attack}} was {{influenced}} by their army's experiences during the Battle of France. Their strategy {{was to create a}} diversion through the campaign in Albania, thus stripping the Hellenic Army of manpower for the defence of their Yugoslavian and Bulgarian borders. By driving armoured wedges through the weakest links of the defence chain, penetrating Allied territory would not require substantial armour behind an infantry advance. Once Southern Yugoslavia was overrun by German armour, the Metaxas Line could be outflanked by highly mobile forces <b>thrusting</b> southward from Yugoslavia.

5|$|The Javan rhino is {{much less}} vocal than the Sumatran; very few Javan rhino vocalizations have ever been recorded. Adults have no known predators other than humans. The species, {{particularly}} in Vietnam, is skittish and retreats into dense forests whenever humans are near.

Nevertheless, when humans approach too closely, the Javan rhino becomes aggressive and will attack, stabbing with the incisors of its lower jaw while <b>thrusting</b> upward with its head. Its comparatively antisocial behavior may be a recent adaptation to population stresses; historical evidence suggests they, like other rhinos, were once more gregarious.|$|E

5000|$|Naturally, as {{altitude}} increases, {{there is}} a decrease in air density and, therefore, the net <b>thrust</b> of an engine. There is also a flight speed effect, termed <b>thrust</b> lapse rate. Consider the approximate equation for net <b>thrust</b> again:With a high specific <b>thrust</b> (e.g., fighter) engine, the jet velocity is relatively high, so intuitively one can see that increases in flight velocity have less of an impact upon net <b>thrust</b> than a medium specific <b>thrust</b> (e.g., trainer) engine, where the jet velocity is lower. The impact of <b>thrust</b> lapse rate upon a low specific <b>thrust</b> (e.g., civil) engine is even more severe. At high flight speeds, high-specific-thrust engines can pick up net <b>thrust</b> through the ram rise in the intake, but this effect tends to diminish at supersonic speeds because of shock wave losses.|$|R
