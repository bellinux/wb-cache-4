500|$|In 2002, Sanz {{recorded}} MTV Unplugged at the Gusman Center for the Performing Arts in Miami, Florida. He was {{the first}} Spanish artist to record and release an MTV Unplugged album. For Sanz, the recording of the album [...] "changed <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> my music. It was a rediscovery of how to perform, and also how to record, music with live musicians. That was {{the spirit of the}} music in its pure form, though [...] that the more people who are playing, the more simple it is." [...] With the MTV Unplugged, he garnered three Latin Grammy Awards (Album of the Year, Recording of the Year and Song of the Year for [...] "Y Sólo Se Me Ocurre Amarte").|$|E
500|$|When Dewey Phillips first aired [...] "That's All Right" [...] on Memphis radio, many {{listeners}} who {{contacted the}} station by phone and telegram {{to ask for}} it again assumed that its singer was black. From {{the beginning of his}} national fame, Presley expressed respect for African American performers and their music, and disregard for the norms of segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician Arthur Crudup—the originator of [...] "That's All Right"—"bang his box <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> now, and I said if I ever got to the place where I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw." [...] The Memphis World, an African American newspaper, reported that Presley, [...] "the rock 'n' roll phenomenon", [...] "cracked Memphis's segregation laws" [...] by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its [...] "colored night". Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during the early days of his stardom. By contrast, many white adults, according to Billboards Arnold Shaw, [...] "did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ponting also {{responded to}} Lillee's {{comments}} that Shane Warne should be captain, {{and that he}} made more decisions than Ponting during the series: [...] "I {{like to talk to}} a lot of guys out on the field and use their ideas and thoughts. I'll go to Gilly (Adam Gilchrist) and even Matty Hayden, Justin Langer, Damien Martyn... The way I think {{is not going to be}} right 100 percent of the time, but that's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> it. Warne has got a cricket brain as good as anybody around. But I wouldn't agree [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|Essentially, the key {{components}} to Parker's pedal setup is a Holy Grail reverb into a Blues Driver into a Carbon Copy delay into a Dyna Comp into a Small Stone phaser into a Fuzz Face {{and then into}} a Diamond Vibrato (vibrato added during Lonerism-era). The reverb into a fuzz and phasers set to a slow rate are the hallmarks of Parker's guitar sound, which has influenced many modern psychedelic rock bands to have a similar setup, which Parker says [...] "it’s the most flattering {{thing in the world}} to hear a band ripping you off. I know some people get pissed off by it, but if I ever hear an artist and I can tell they’re using a phaser pedal <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> it’s a massive compliment. It makes you feel like you’re making an impression, having an impact on people, which is really humbling, flattering".|$|E
2500|$|Noted of Walker's proper swing {{balance by}} the authors of Lau's Laws on Hitting, [...] "don't be fooled into {{thinking}} that all of his glowing statistics {{are the result of}} playing at Coors Field. [...] He posted some superb numbers in Montreal, too." [...] Former AL batting champion George Brett offered on playing at Coors that [...] "you have to adjust to what the ballpark offers you. [...] The reason I hit <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> is [...] Stadium — the big outfield and the turf. [...] You play half your games there." [...] Mike Piazza, who finished second to Walker in the 1997 NL MVP voting, commented the same year that [...] "Walker is a great player having a great year. [...] He plays in a great hitter's park, and I think it's unfortunate that some of their players don't get the credit they deserve because of that." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the race, Michael Schumacher accused Coulthard of [...] "unsporting behaviour" [...] in {{the battle}} for the race lead. The {{accusation}} arose from Coulthard's minor collision with the Ferrari driver. Michael Schumacher believed that Coulthard was driving dangerously: [...] "He [...] ran in a way that he thought it [...] could happen, and he didn't try to avoid that, that's pretty simple. As he is not fighting for the championship.....I {{just want to make sure}} that we don't see teammates helping the drivers fighting for the championship in the way which is not appropriate." [...] Coulthard denied any wrongdoing: [...] "I could have easily pushed him off the circuit. But I didn't and I won't in the future because it is not sporting and it is not <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> things." [...] There was similar ill-feeling between Trulli and Button after their collision on lap two. Trulli called the Williams driver an [...] "idiot" [...] and accused him of [...] "driving like a crazy". Button defended his actions and suggested that Trulli had moved slightly towards him although he believed he took the right line. He also believed Trulli moved towards him under braking.|$|E

2500|$|On September 19, 1968, Foley {{appeared}} in two Opry performances in Fort Wayne, Indiana, {{sponsored by the}} local Sheriff's Posse that included Billy Walker and 19-year-old Hank Williams, Jr., son of his long-time friend Hank Williams. Before the second show, according to Walker, Foley came to his dressing room and Walker shared his faith in Christ: Foley said, [...] "Do you think God could ever forgive a sinner like me?" [...] He began to tell me all the rotten things he had done in his life, and I {{looked him in the}} face and said, [...] "Red, if God can forgive me, He can forgive you." [...] I prayed with Red. [...] He went out, and the last song he sang was [...] "Peace in the Valley." [...] He came over to side of the stage and said, 'Billy, I've never sung that song and feel <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> tonight.' Foley suffered respiratory failure that night and died in his sleep, prompting Hank Williams, Jr. to write and record (as Luke the Drifter, Jr.) I Was With Red Foley (The Night He Passed Away). [...] According to the song, which charted that November, his last words were, [...] "I'm awful tired now, Hank. [...] I've got to go to bed." [...] Foley had sung [...] "Peace in the Valley" [...] at Hank Sr.'s funeral. [...] Foley was interred in Woodlawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Nashville.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} the facts that Nat King Cole had the #7 song in 1959, and the #1 song in 1921, and Chuck Berry had a major hit with [...] "Maybellene" [...] in 1955, in the United States in the 1950s legal {{segregation}} and discrimination against African Americans was common, especially in the Deep South. Presley would nevertheless publicly cite his debt to African American music, pointing to artists such as B. B. King, Arthur [...] "Big Boy" [...] Crudup, Ivory Joe Hunter, and Fats Domino. The reporter who conducted Presley's first interview in New York City in 1956 noted that he named blues singers who [...] "obviously {{meant a lot to}} him. [...] was very surprised to hear him talk about the black performers down there and about how he tried to carry on their music." [...] Later that year in Charlotte, North Carolina, Presley was quoted as saying: [...] "The colored folks been singing it and playing it just like I’m doin' now, man, for more years than I know. They played it like that in their shanties and in their juke joints and nobody paid it no mind 'til I goosed it up. I got it from them. Down in Tupelo, Mississippi, I used to hear old Arthur Crudup bang his box <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> now and I said if I ever got to a place I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw." [...] Little Richard said of Presley: [...] "He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door for black music." [...] B. B. King said he began to respect Presley after he did Arthur [...] "Big Boy" [...] Crudup material and that after he met him, he thought the singer really was something else and was someone whose music was growing all the time right up to his death.|$|E
