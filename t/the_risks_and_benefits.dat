5|$|Guidelines {{for the use}} {{of drugs}} in the {{management}} of cancer pain have been published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and others. Healthcare professionals have an ethical obligation to ensure that, whenever possible, the patient or patient's guardian is well-informed about <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> associated with their pain management options. Adequate pain management may sometimes slightly shorten a dying person's life.|$|E
25|$|In the US, this {{doctrine}} places a legal obligation on {{a doctor to}} make a patient aware {{of the reason for}} treatment, <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> of a proposed treatment, <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> of alternative treatment, and <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> of receiving no treatment. The patient is then given the opportunity to accept or reject the treatment. The form states how many treatments are recommended and also makes the patient aware that consent may be revoked and treatment discontinued at any time during a course of ECT. The US Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health states that patients should be warned that the benefits of ECT are short-lived without active continuation treatment in the form of drugs or further ECT, and that there may be some risk of permanent, severe memory loss after ECT. The report advises psychiatrists to involve patients in discussion, possibly with the aid of leaflets or videos, both before and during a course of ECT.|$|E

In resolving the perceived ptosis {{of a woman with}} encapsulated breast implants, the surgeon determines her suitability for a breast lift procedure after explantation, which facilitates assessment of the true degree of ptosis present in the explanted breasts; likewise the assessment of the effects of a combined breast-lift and revision-augmentation procedure, featuring the removal and the replacement of breast implants. For the woman who is at high risk for developing breast cancer (primary or recurrent), the mastopexy might alter the histologic architecture of the breasts, which tissue change might interfere with the accurate MRI detection and subsequent treatment of cancer; <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> will be discussed in that setting.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to understand that <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> associated with oophorectomy in the BRCA1/2 mutation carrier population are different than those for the general population. Prophylactic risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is an important option for the high-risk population to consider. Women with BRCA1/2 mutations who undergo salpingo-oophorectomy have lower all-cause mortality rates than women in the same population who do not undergo this procedure. In addition, RRSO has been shown to decrease mortality specific to breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Women who undergo RRSO are also at a lower risk for developing ovarian cancer and first occurrence breast cancer. Specifically, RRSO provides BRCA1 mutation carriers with no prior breast cancer a 70% reduction of ovarian cancer risk. BRCA1 mutation carriers with prior breast cancer can benefit from an 85% reduction. High-risk women who have not had prior breast cancer can benefit from a 37% (BRCA1 mutation) and 64% (BRCA2 mutation) reduction of breast cancer risk. These benefits are important to highlight, as they are unique to this BRCA1/2 mutation carrier population.|$|E
