40|$|When young sterlet is {{suffering}} from <b>tympanism,</b> biochemical and pathophysiological disorders are observed; the activity of malate dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase lowers in the fish liver and muscles, while the activity of lactate dehydrogenase increases. Such disorders are accompanied by changes in the level and balance of - 3 and - 6 fatty acids towards decrease in - 3 fatty acids...|$|E
40|$|The {{processes}} of free radical oxidation are {{shown to be}} activated {{at the expense of}} antioxidants depletion if <b>tympanism</b> of young sterlet is developing. At the same time the level of phospholipids decreases, the content of mono- and diacylglycerols increases considerably, and the {{processes of}} lipolysis are activated with simultaneous rising of the lisophosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin levels and decreasing in phosphatidylserine. </span...|$|E

30|$|The {{choice of}} {{anaesthetic}} technique for laparoscopic surgery is predominantly general anaesthesia. However, {{penetration of the}} stomach may occur when the stomach is distended during the induction of anaesthesia. Some reports have implicated {{the use of a}} laryngeal mask as a cause for gastric distension, particularly if it is unknowingly malpositioned, and therefore an independent risk factor for gastric injury [7]. A laryngeal mask was used in our patient, and we believe that this may have been responsible for the hyperinflation of the stomach causing it to descend to a level below the umbilicus and {{in the path of the}} Veress needle and trocar. Care needs to be taken to avoid overinflating the stomach during ventilation. Where this is suspected to have occurred, due to upper abdominal distension or increased <b>tympanism,</b> a nasogastric tube should be inserted to evacuate the stomach prior to the creation of pneumoperitoneum in order to prevent injuries to the anterior surface of the stomach [4]. Should a complication occur, early recognition is essential.|$|E
40|$|Laryngocele {{is a rare}} pathology, {{but because}} of their {{clinical}} evolution and the symptoms they generate, they should always {{be considered as a}} differential diagnosis when investigating neck masses. A laryngocele is basically a herniation of the mucosa of the laryngeal ventricle (Morgagni's ventricle) arising usually from the saccular region. This herniation may remain confined to the larynx - in which case the laryngocele is internal- or expand through the thyro-hyoid membrane into the structures of the neck - thus being called an external laryngocele. Usually the laryngocele has both an internal and external component thus being a mixed laryngocele. Diagnosis of laryngoceles still relies heavily on clinical signs such as <b>tympanism,</b> easily depressible neck mass, indirect laryngoscopy, but is now simplified by imagistic investigations (ultrasound, CT and MRI). However, the treatment of this condition is exclusively surgical and consists of total excision of the laryngocele, as well as proper identification of the point of origin from the saccule and also the final suture of the breach in order to prevent recurrence. Investigation of possible causes of obstruction of the laryngeal ventricle should always be performed (because of the possibility of an underlying malignancy) as well as a follow-up protocol of the patient, given the risk of relapse. We present a recently diagnosed case of a 32 year old man with mixed laryngocele, which we have operated in our clinic...|$|E
40|$|Condensed tannins {{are formed}} by {{monomers}} of procyanidins and prodelfinidins, where the proportion and concentration of their monomers {{varies according to}} the plant species and environmental conditions. In Lotus spp., condensed tannins prevent <b>tympanism</b> in ruminants that feed on them. This study aimed to evaluate the concentration of procyanidins and their monomers, catechin and epicatechin in the genotypes of Lotus L. grown in soil with different saturations of aluminum. A two-factor (genotype × Al saturation) assay was performed, where the genotypes São Gabriel, Ganador, and UFRGS (Lotus corniculatus L.); Serrano (Lotus uliginosus); and El Rincón (Lotus subbiflorus) were cultivated in soil with an Al saturation of 0 - 20 %. The procyanidins were evaluated using high-performance liquid chromatography, which was previously validated for catechin and epicatechin. The concentration of procyanidins {{and the proportion of}} epicatechin:catechin were affected by the genotype × environment interaction. In L. corniculatus and L. subbiflorus, the concentration of procyanidin was significantly higher when they were grown in the soil with an Al saturation of 20 % compared to that when they were grown in the soil with 0 % Al saturation, but the opposite effect was observed in L. uliginosus. The proportion of epicatechin:catechin decreased in plants grown in soil without Al, and only the UFRGS genotype maintained a similar proportion under both the soil acidity conditions. The predominant monomer was epicatechin, which varied from 57 % to 75 % according to the soil in which the plants were grown. </p...|$|E
40|$|A 47 -year-old {{man came}} to the {{hospital}} because acute abdominal pain and vomits. The patient had suffered from epi-sodes of intestinal obstruction since adolescence, and has been studied by a gastroenterologist who found no abnormali-ties. These episodes have been solved spontaneously in nearly all occasions. However, {{he had come to}} the emergency room for the same reason twice last year. The exploration showed abdominal distension and <b>tympanism</b> in the epigas-trium. There were neither laparotomic scars nor hernia defects in the abdominal wall. Abdominal X-rays showed air-fluid levels at the small bowel, and marked distension in the proximal and medium jejunum. Gastrointestinal X-ray series with gastrographin showed no abnormal findings. After 48 - 72 hours the patient persisted with the same complaints, and we de-cided to operate. During the operation we found a congenital malformation: an intestinal hernia of jejunum inside a peri-toneal sac formed by a peritoneal flap of the left mesentery (Fig. 1), as well as an abnormal implantation of the mesentery above the rectum. We performed a resection of the peritoneal sac (Fig. 2) and the adherences inside it. The postoperative period was normal. DISCUSSION Paraduodenal hernias are rare congenital malformations, but they are the most frequent cause of internal hernias (50 % of them). They are caused by a failure in the intestinal rotation, and by an asynchronism in the future development of ad-hesion of the mesocolon. In right paraduodenal hernias, the small bowel is placed totally or partially behind the ascending mesocolon; in left paraduodenal hernias or mesocolic hernias, which are more frequent than the right ones, the small bo-wel is placed behind the descending mesocolon (1). We present a rare case of a paraduodenal sac formed by a peritoneal Atypical left paraduodenal herni...|$|E
40|$|From {{the years}} eighty, the viral encephalopathy-retinopathy (VER, OIE 2003), {{neuropathy}} {{caused by a}} virus belonging to genus Betanodavirus, family Nodaviridae (Ball et al., 2000), is responsible for severe losses in many species of marine farmed fish (more than 31 species distributed 16 different families) throughout the world (Munday et al., 2002). In the Mediterranean basin the VER has been quickly diffused from years ninety, affecting above all seabass (D. labrax) and, later on, shi drum (U. cirrosa). To the contrary, spontaneous infection reports of VER in gilthead seabream (S. aurata) have been very rarely documented (Comps and Raymond 1996; Castric et al., 2001). Although the gilthead can be experimentally infected (Novoa et al., 2001; Aranguren et al., 2002), it thought {{that it is a}} resistant species, documented from the fact that, during serious VER outbreaks in seabass larvae or in other species, no gilthead larvae infection is seen. Some authors documented, through experimental infection, as this species represent rather an asymptomatic carrier of betanodavirus (Castric et al., 2001; Aranguren et al., 2002), more pathogenic for seabass. The descriptive attempt of this surveying is to document a massive mortality outbreak in 15 day-old gilthead larvae, ascribable to viral encephalopathy-retinopathy {{on the basis of the}} histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses. Gilthead larvae, reared in tanks at density of 150 ind/l and supplied to marine filtered and sterilised water (temperature 20 - 21 °C and salinity 40 ‰), showed swim bladder <b>tympanism,</b> abdominal distension, lethargy, anorexia and alteration swim arrangement. During the acute phase of mortality, two samples of moribund larvae have been collected (19 and 29 days of age) and fixed in 4 % neutral buffered formalin. The immunohistochemical tests, using two monoclonal antibodies anti-VER (supplied from the Lombardia and Emilia IZS), were performed. The histopathological observations have put in evidence the presence of the characteristic vacuolar lesions of the central nervous system and peripheral ascribable to VER, localized above all in optic lobe, medulla oblongata, spinal verve chord and in the retinal layers (outer and inner nuclear layer). The immunoperoxidase has confirmed the presence of the virus in the tissues, showing a strongly positivity close to the lesions, characterised by the intense brown diaminobenzidine staining. After the existing literature analysis, this report seems to be the first massive mortality outbreak in gilthead larvae caused by a spontaneous infection of viral encephalopathy-retinopathy in Italy...|$|E
40|$|Com o objetivo de melhor caracterizar o quadro clínico na intoxicação {{experimental}} por Stryphnodendron obovatum Benth., procedeu-se a administração das favas, por via oral, a seis bovinos, em doses únicas e a 11 outros, em doses repetidas. Doses únicas de 10 e 20 g/kg não provocaram sintomas. Doses únicas de 30 e 40 g/kg provocaram quadros clínicos desde leves até graves, porém só morreu o animal que ingeriu 60 g/kg. Os animais que ingeriram doses repetidas de 2, 5 g/kg por 30 dias adoeceram levemente, já os que receberam 5 g/kg durante 13 e 14 dias mostraram sintomatologia moderada e grave, respectivamente. Um bovino que recebeu 10 g/kg por 8 dias, outro que ingeriu 20 g/kg por 3 dias e dois outros que receberam 30 e 40 g/kg por 2 dias morreram da intoxicação. Os outros três bovinos que receberam doses repetidas (dois com doses de 10 g/kg por 20 e 6 dias, outro com dose de 20 g/kg por 2 dias) adoeceram, mas se recuperaram. Os primeiros sintomas de intoxicação, em ambos os grupos, foram observados a partir do primeiro dia do experimento e a evolução variou de 3 a 63 dias. Os sintomas consistiram em anorexia, fezes levemente ressecadas a líquidas, distensão do abdômen, sem timpanismo, perda de fluido ruminal durante a ruminação, atonia e acidose ruminal, cólica, sialorréia, apatia, emagrecimento, fraqueza, erosões e úlceras na cavidade oral. Em alguns animais foram observadas congestão de mucosas visíveis (sem icterícia) e de partes despigmentadas da pele, do córion laminar e da região interdigital dos quatro membros, áreas de alopecia focal e/ou hipotricose nas regiões axilares, na face lateral das coxas e membros e perda dos pêlos da ponta da cauda, alterações estas que podem ser interpretadas como as de leve fotossensibilização. Em três bovinos se observaram relaxamento intermitente do prepúcio, micção freqüente e em gotejamento e, por vezes, gemidos ao eliminar a urina que, em geral, se apresentava turva, ácida, de cor âmbar-escura, com odor adocicado e com a densidade elevada; os níveis de bilirrubina na urina foram normais. In {{order to}} contribute to the characterization of the clinical-pathological picture of poisoning by Stryphnodendron obovatum Benth. (Leg. Mimosoideae), the pods of the tree were given orally to 17 young bovines. Six animals received the pods only once: Those which received doses of 10 and 20 g/kg, did not show any symptoms of poisoning. Those which received 30, 40 and 40 g/kg of pods, showed respectively moderate, severe and slight symptoms of poisoning, but all recovered. The animal that was fed 60 g/kg, died. Eleven bovines received repeated doses of the pods: Two of them, which received 2, 5 g/kg during 30 days, showed discrete to slight symptoms. Two animals received 5 g/kg during 13 and 14 days and showed moderate to severe poisoning. Three animals received 10 g/kg during 20, 8 and 6 days; the first of them showed slight symptoms, the second died and the third showed moderate to severe symptoms. Two animals received 20 g/kg during 2 and 3 days; the first showed slight symptoms, the second died. The two bovines which were fed 30 and 40 g/kg during 2 days, died. First symptoms of poisoning were observed from {{the first day of the}} experiments on, and the clinical course varied from 3 to 63 days. Digestive disorders predominated in the clinical-pathological picture. Symptoms were mainly loss of appetite up to anorexia, faeces slightly dry to liquid, distention of the abdomen without <b>tympanism,</b> loss of ruminal fluid during rumination, decrease in ruminal activity up to atonia, ruminal acidosis, gastro-intestinal colics, sialorrhoea, apathy, loss of weight, debility, erosions and ulcers of the oral mucosa. There was congestion of the visible mucous membranes (without icterus) and of the interdigital parts of the hoofs, areas of focal alopecia and/or hypotrichia in the axillary regions, the lateral parts of the tighs and members, loss of hair on the tip of the tail, alterations which can be interpreted as slight photosensitization. In two bovines aspiration pneumonia was verified. In three animals intermittent prolapse of the prepuce was seen, as well as polacuria; sometimes these animals sighed during urination. In all experimental animals the urine was generally turbid, acid, dark ambar, with a sweat smell and high density, and there was proteinuria; in a few animals glicosuria was diagnosed. Bilirubine values were normal. Thus, the severe photosensitization reported in the literature could not be reproduced. Loss of weight, slight photosensitization and absence of icterus, observed in our experiments, are in accordance with the symptoms reported by farmers of the Cerrado-regions (Savanna) where S. obovatum occurs...|$|E
