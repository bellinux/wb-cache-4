500|$|Proponents {{state the}} FairTax {{would reduce the}} number of tax filers by about 86% (from 100 million to 14 million) and reduce the filing {{complexity}} to a simplified state sales tax form. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), among others, have specifically identified the negative relationship between compliance costs and the number of focal points for collection. Under the FairTax, the federal government would be able to concentrate <b>tax</b> <b>enforcement</b> efforts on a single tax. Retailers would receive an administrative fee equal to the greater of $200 or 0.25% of the remitted tax as compensation for compliance costs. In addition, supporters state that the overwhelming majority of purchases occur in major retail outlets, which are very unlikely to evade the FairTax and risk losing their business licenses. Economic Census figures for 2002 show that 48.5% of merchandise sales are made by just 688 businesses ("Big-Box" [...] retailers). 85.7% of all retail sales are made by 92,334 businesses, which is 3.6% of American companies. In the service sector, approximately 80% of sales are made by 1.2% of U.S. businesses.|$|E

30|$|In {{the high}} <b>tax</b> and <b>enforcement</b> economy, very few workers {{may choose to}} educate {{themselves}} which reduces the tax base and thus induces modest tax revenues even though tax rates are high (negatively sloped side of the Laffer curve). In the low <b>tax</b> and <b>enforcement</b> economy, in contrast, many workers find it worthwhile to educate themselves which induces a large tax base which enables the government to obtain equally high revenues despite low tax rates (positively sloped side of the Laffer curve). This scenario is potentially possible in our model.|$|R
40|$|Within the {{literature}} on business cycles featuring underground activities, there is an approach based on the arguable premise that these are countercyclical. This paper develops a real business cycle model without such an assumption. Preferences are additively separable in formal and underground labor. Further, leisure time is spent on irregular work and non-market activities. Simulations permit examining how the model performs and comparing the results with related findings. Also, computational experiments allow analyzing the effects of <b>taxes,</b> <b>enforcement</b> and tastes for underground labor on aggregate fluctuations. These experiments offer a comprehensive view of the cyclical implications of the shadow economy...|$|R
30|$|In {{the case}} of two equilibria, the low <b>tax</b> and <b>enforcement</b> equilibria is {{preferable}} from a welfare point of view. As was seen in Section 5.1, it was optimal to correct for the distortion {{in terms of that}} too few workers did choose to educate themselves. However, it was not optimal to fully correct for this distortion, leaving the educated stock below a socially optimal value, since distortions on the labour market then became inefficiently high. Clearly, the high <b>tax</b> and <b>enforcement</b> economy worsens the problem by inducing an educational stock which is, for the same wedge, even further away from what is socially optimal. This leads the government to use the wedges to push the economy further away from an efficient labour market outcome in order to correct for this additional distortion in education. Both the labour market distortions and the educational distortion is in this economy larger at the socially optimal wedges than at the socially optimal wedges chosen under the low <b>tax</b> and <b>enforcement</b> economy.|$|R
