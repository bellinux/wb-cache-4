40|$|Electric Overhead <b>Travelling</b> (EOT) <b>Crane</b> {{is one of}} the {{essential}} industrial equipment for material handling job. In recent years little {{attention has been paid to}} the optimal design of Heavy Electric Overhead <b>Travelling</b> <b>Crane</b> <b>Bridges.</b> The motive might be, but not limited to the availability of prevailing FEM, DIN, ISO, CMAA, BS, Chinese and now CEN standards for the design of cranes. Most of the crane manufacturers have standardized the single dimensioned box section for multiple spans and duties of <b>Crane</b> <b>Bridges</b> for manufacturing simplicity. Owing to the recent upward trend in the price of structural materials not to mention the demanding dimensions of heavy duty crane box girders, utilization of modern design optimization tools is inevitable. This paper demonstrates design optimization of EOT crane thin walled welded box girder subjected to rolling loads. A simple and innovative procedure has been introduced to use Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG 2) nonlinear optimization code for optimization of various parameters of the welded box section bridge and then comparing the results with the FE simulation. Local buckling of web and compression flange has also been taken in account while performing GRG 2 optimization. Later vigorous random and 1 st order Design Optimization is performed to establish design space and convergent solutions utilizing commercially available FEA software. Maximum allowable bending stress, allowable shear stress and deflection are constrained to recommended limits of design norms, keeping the volume of the bridge as objective function. The size and thicknesses of plates, stiffeners and reinforcement are included as design parameter...|$|R

40|$|The {{serious problem}} in <b>travelling</b> <b>cranes</b> maintenance, crane {{supporting}} beams and other carrying elements of material handling facilities in foundry shops is phenomenon of permanent deformations. There are known many ways to eliminate these deformations like mechanical compression by tension members however a disadvantage of such methods is work consuming process of railways rectification. One of technological methods relies on application of shrinkage of compression plates welded with box girder. Regeneration {{with the use of}} such method can be executed for the <b>travelling</b> <b>cranes</b> box girders but also with <b>travelling</b> <b>crane</b> support beams that have permanent deformations in both vertical or horizontal planes. In this paper different variants of such process execution are presented, depending on the kind and dimension of the permanent deformation...|$|R
