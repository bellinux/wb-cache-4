5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1991, Stoke {{chairman}} Peter Coates offered Smith the vacant management position at the club, but Smith decided <b>that</b> <b>potentially</b> being dismissed by his hometown club would be too intense an experience emotionally, and chose to stay loyal to Sunderland. This was despite finances being tight at Sunderland as the club saved the money to build the Stadium of Light. However, after just 4 wins in the opening 14 matches of 1991–92, Smith decided to sell star striker Gabbiadini to Crystal Palace for £1.8million {{in order to raise}} funds to improve the squad. He then spent £350,000 on Celtic left-back Anton Rogan and brought in strikers Don Goodman (£900,000 from West Bromwich Albion) and John Byrne (£225,000 from Brighton & Hove Albion). Smith was dismissed on 30 December 1991, with Sunderland lying 17th in the Second Division. His former assistant Malcolm Crosby took Sunderland to the 1992 FA Cup Final, in which they were beaten by Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Wau, 29–31 January 1943, was {{a battle}} in the New Guinea {{campaign}} of World War II. Forces of the Empire of Japan sailed from Rabaul and crossed the Solomon Sea and, despite Allied air attacks, successfully reached Lae, where they disembarked. Japanese troops then advanced overland on Wau, an Australian base <b>that</b> <b>potentially</b> threatened the Japanese positions at Salamaua and Lae. A race developed between the Japanese moving overland, hampered by the terrain, and the Australians, moving by air, hampered by the weather. By the time the Japanese reached the Wau area after a trek over the mountains, the Australian defenders had been greatly reinforced by air. In the battle that followed, despite achieving tactical surprise by approaching from an unexpected direction, the Japanese attackers were unable to capture Wau.|$|E
5|$|The Lubitz family held a {{press conference}} on 24 March 2017, two years after the crash. Lubitz's father said that they did not accept the {{official}} investigative findings that Andreas Lubitz deliberately caused the crash or that he had been depressed at the time. They presented aviation journalist Tim van Beveren, whom they had commissioned to publish a new report, which asserted that Lubitz could have fallen unconscious, that the cockpit door lock had malfunctioned on previous flights, and <b>that</b> <b>potentially</b> dangerous turbulence had been reported in the area {{on the day of the}} crash. The timing of the press conference by Lubitz's father, on the anniversary of the crash, was criticized by families of the victims, who were holding their own remembrances on that day.|$|E

5|$|Staff Sergeant Leroy A. Petry {{distinguished}} {{himself by}} acts of gallantry and intrepidity {{at the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} in action with an armed enemy in the vicinity of Paktya Province, Afghanistan, on May 26, 2008. As a Weapons Squad Leader with D Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, Staff Sergeant Petry moved to clear the courtyard of a house <b>that</b> <b>potentially</b> contained high-value combatants. While crossing the courtyard, Staff Sergeant Petry and another Ranger were engaged and wounded by automatic weapons fire from enemy fighters. Still under enemy fire, and wounded in both legs, Staff Sergeant Petry led the other Ranger to cover. He then reported the situation and engaged the enemy with a hand grenade, providing suppression as another Ranger moved to his position. The enemy quickly responded by maneuvering closer and throwing grenades. The first grenade explosion knocked his two fellow Rangers to the ground and wounded both with shrapnel. A second grenade then landed only a few feet away from them. Instantly realizing the danger, Staff Sergeant Petry, unhesitatingly and with complete disregard for his safety, deliberately and selflessly moved forward, picked up the grenade, and in an effort to clear the immediate threat, threw the grenade away from his fellow Rangers. As he was releasing the grenade it detonated, amputating his right hand at the wrist and further injuring him with multiple shrapnel wounds. Although picking up and throwing the live grenade grievously wounded Staff Sergeant Petry, his gallant act undeniably saved his fellow Rangers from being severely wounded or killed. Despite the severity of his wounds, Staff Sergeant Petry continued to maintain the presence of mind to place a tourniquet on his right wrist before communicating the situation by radio in order to coordinate support for himself and his fellow wounded Rangers. Staff Sergeant Petry's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service, and reflect great credit upon himself, 75th Ranger Regiment, and the United States Army.|$|E

Inward airflow is maintained at a minimum velocity of 75ft/min(0.38 m/s). These BSCs are commonly used to enclose specific equipment (e.g. centrifuges) or procedures (e.g. aerating cultures) <b>that</b> <b>potentially</b> generate aerosols. BSCs of this class are either ducted (connected to the building exhaust system) or unducted (recirculating filtered exhaust back into the laboratory).|$|E

But the Harpers Ferry garrison had not retreated. Lee planned to capture the garrison and the arsenal, not only to seize its supplies of rifles and ammunition, but to secure his line of supply back to Virginia.|$|E

25|$|Some {{opponents of}} ABC contend that since only few models—subjectively chosen and {{probably}} all wrong—can be realistically considered, ABC analyses provide only limited insight. However, {{there is an}} important distinction between identifying a plausible null hypothesis and assessing the relative fit of alternative hypotheses. Since useful null hypotheses, <b>that</b> <b>potentially</b> hold true, can extremely seldom be put forward in the context of complex models, predictive ability of statistical models as explanations of complex phenomena is far more important than the test of a statistical null hypothesis in this context. It is also common to average over the investigated models, weighted based on their relative plausibility, to infer model features (e.g., parameter values) and to make predictions.|$|E
25|$|However, {{sometimes}} the resource {{may be so}} prized <b>that</b> <b>potentially</b> fatal confrontations can occur to acquire them. Male elephant seals, Mirounga augustirostris, engage in fierce competitive displays {{in an attempt to}} control a large harem of females with which to mate. The distribution of females and subsequent reproductive success is very uneven between males. The reproductive success of most males is zero; they die before breeding age or are prevented from mating by higher ranked males. In addition, just a few dominant males account for the majority of copulations. The potential reproductive success for males is so great that many are killed before breeding age as they attempt to move up the hierarchy in their population.|$|E
25|$|The {{most likely}} {{hydrocarbon}} source rocks are Early Jurassic marine mudstones. These are fully mature for oil generation {{in the west}} of the British sector, and are mature for gas generation nearby in the Irish sector. Gas-prone, Westphalian pre-rift coal measures may also be present at depth locally. The Cardigan Bay Basin was subjected to two Tertiary phases of compressive uplift, whereas maximum burial that terminated primary hydrocarbon generation was probably around the end of the Cretaceous, or earlier if Cretaceous strata, now missing, were never deposited in the basin. Despite the Tertiary structuration, the Dragon discovery has proved <b>that</b> <b>potentially</b> commercial volumes of hydrocarbons were retained at least locally in Cardigan Bay. In addition to undrilled structural traps, the basin contains untested potential for stratigraphic entrapment of hydrocarbons near synsedimentary faults, especially in the Middle Jurassic section.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, Savcor (a {{company which}} specialises in {{restoration}} techniques for concrete and steel) was contracted to do a detailed survey of His Majesty's Theatre. This survey revealed {{a number of}} defects on the facades <b>that</b> <b>potentially</b> rendered it unsafe. In 2010, a project involving the restoration of damaged cornices and corbels was carried out. Damaged decorations were replaced by using modern repair mortars which produced perfect reproductions. Mick Summers {{was in charge of}} crafting the ornate flowers around the façade. This was achieved with the help of latex moulds which were taken from the original form. Due to structural deterioration, many of the balconies had to be rebuilt completely. The balconies' many features, including clamshell base, curved profile and plaster features, required many different processes to recreate the original. Both latex moulding and traditional construction techniques were used to make sure the balconies remained durable.|$|E
25|$|The feud {{ended on}} February 24, 2002, at Pride 19, where Shamrock fought Frye {{in the main}} event in a match <b>that</b> <b>potentially</b> had PRIDE Heavyweight Championship title {{implications}} (PRIDE FC considered giving the winner of this fight a title shot against Pride heavyweight champion Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira). Frye got the edge {{on a series of}} clinch battles, while Shamrock dropped down for an ankle lock and transitioned into both a kneebar and a toehold, wrenching Frye's leg badly; however, despite the damage, Frye refused to tap out and managed to knock Shamrock down in a subsequent punching exchange. The bout moved to the mat, where Shamrock attempted another ankle lock, only for Frye to try to counter with one of his own and finally refusing to tap out by sheer will until the time ran out. Shamrock lost a close split decision, and the two hugged after the fight ended, putting an end to their rivalry.|$|E
25|$|The San Bruno Mountain Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP), {{the first}} of its kind in the United States, was adopted in 1983. Currently, it is the only HCP <b>that</b> <b>potentially</b> {{addresses}} the Bay checkerspot. The plan covers some 3,400acres(14km2) in northern San Mateo County and identifies seven animal species and 44 plant species to be conserved. Among them, the federally endangered Mission blue and the Bay checkerspot butterfly, the Bay checkerspot was not federally listed when the plan was adopted. Thus, this HCP's primary focus is on the two species of butterfly that were federally listed when it was adopted in 1983, the Mission blue butterfly and San Bruno elfin butterfly. The permit for the plan expires on March 31, 2013, and there are currently no provisions in the HCP for incidental take of Bay checkerspots. The Bay checkerspot was lost on San Bruno Mountain around 1986. The impetuses included fires, non-native plant species and natural fluctuations. The reintroduction of the Bay checkerspot is one of the goals of the San Bruno HCP.|$|E

25|$|The United States Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{performed}} {{indoor air}} quality testing for formaldehyde {{in some of the}} units. On February 14, 2008, the CDC announced <b>that</b> <b>potentially</b> hazardous levels of formaldehyde were found in many of the travel trailers and manufactured homes provided by the agency. The CDC's preliminary evaluation of a scientifically established random sample of 519 travel trailers and manufactured homes tested between December 21, 2007, and January 23, 2008 (2+ years after manufacture), showed average levels of formaldehyde in all units of about 0.077 parts per million (ppm). Long-term exposure to levels in this range can be linked to an increased risk of cancer and, at levels above this range, there can also be a risk of respiratory illness. These levels are higher than expected in indoor air, where levels are commonly in the range of 0.01–0.02 ppm, and are higher than the Agency for Toxic Substance Disease Registry (ATSDR, division of the CDC) Minimal Risk Level (MRL) of 0.008 ppm. Levels measured ranged from 0.003 ppm to 0.59 ppm.|$|E
25|$|In 2015 Inter and Roma {{were the}} only two Italian clubs that were sanctioned by the UEFA due to their {{breaking}} of UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations. As a probation to avoid further sanction, Inter agreed to have a three-year aggregate break-even from 2015 to 2018, with the 2015–16 season being allowed to have a net loss of a maximum of €30million, followed by break-even in the 2016–17 season. Inter was also fined €6million plus an additional €14million in probation. Inter also made a financial trick in the transfer market in summer 2015, in which Stevan Jovetić and Miranda were signed by Inter on temporary deals plus an obligation to sign outright in 2017, making their cost less in the loan period. Moreover, despite heavily investing in new signings, namely Geoffrey Kondogbia and Ivan Perišić <b>that</b> <b>potentially</b> increased the cost in amortization, Inter also sold Mateo Kovačić for €29million, making a windfall profit. On 21 April 2017, Inter announced that their net loss (FFP adjusted) of 2015–16 season was within the settlement agreement allowed limited of €30million. However, UEFA also announced that the reduction of squad size of Inter in European competitions would not be lifted yet.|$|E
25|$|A.C. Fiorentina S.p.A. {{was unable}} to {{register}} for 2002–03 Serie B due to financial difficulties, and then the sports title was transferred to a new company thanks to Article 52 of N.O.I.F., while the old company was liquidated. At that time the club was heavily relying on windfall profit from selling players, especially in pure player swap or cash plus player swap <b>that</b> <b>potentially</b> increased the cost by the increase in amortisation of player contracts (an intangible assets). For example, Marco Rossi joined Fiorentina for 17billion lire in 2000, {{but at the same}} time Lorenzo Collacchioni moved to Salernitana for 1billion lire, meaning the club had a player profit of 997 million lire and extra 1billion lire to be amortised in 5-years. In 1999, Emiliano Bigica also swapped with Giuseppe Taglialatela, which the latter was valued for 10billion lire. The operating income (excluding windfall profit from players trading) of 2000–01 season was minus 113,271,475,933 Italian lire (minus €58,499,835). It was only boosted by the sales of Francesco Toldo and Rui Costa in June 2001 (a profit of 134.883billion lire; €69.661million). However, it was alleged they were to transfer to Parma for a reported 140 million lire. The two players eventually joined Inter Milan and A.C. Milan in 2001–02 financial year instead, for undisclosed fees. Failing to have financial support from the owner Vittorio Cecchi Gori, the club was forced to windup due to its huge imbalance in operating income.|$|E

25|$|It was {{probably}} his {{connection with the}} FitzAlans that assured his appointment as High Sheriff of Shropshire for 1401-2. Before he took up the shrievalty, his friend Sir John Cornwall, a former sheriff and also a former retainer of John of Gaunt, was accused of cattle rustling at Wytheford (also rendered Withiford) in Shropshire. Cornwall counted as family, as he was a grandson of Fulk, 1st Baron Strange of Blackmere, and so a first cousin of Darras's wife. However, the case affected the king's interests, as the plaintiffs, who were demanding £100, alleged that their cattle had already been taken into {{the custody of the}} county escheator when Cornwall removed them. In April 1402 Darras was one of four local gentry who stood surety at Westminster for Cornwall that he would keep the peace, an act <b>that</b> <b>potentially</b> created a conflict of interest. However, the plaintiffs alleged that Darras went much further. When the case was moved to the Shrewsbury assizes by a writ of nisi prius it was claimed that Darras allowed Cornwall to select the jurors. The jury was dismissed and Darras was ordered to summon a new panel for the next assizes. Darras was also the returning officer when Cornwall was elected to Parliament. Cornwall was a man of considerable prestige, claiming descent from King John, but an unstable and dangerous associate, who was to attract constant accusations of violence and intimidation.|$|E
25|$|Lentiviruses are a {{subclass}} of Retroviruses. They {{are sometimes}} used as vectors for gene therapy {{thanks to their}} ability to integrate into the genome of non-dividing cells, which is the unique feature of Lentiviruses as other Retroviruses can infect only dividing cells. The viral genome in the form of RNA is reverse-transcribed when the virus enters the cell to produce DNA, which is then inserted into the genome at a random position (recent findings actually suggest that the insertion of viral DNA is not random but directed to specific active genes and related to genome organisation) by the viral integrase enzyme. The vector, now called a provirus, remains in the genome and is passed on to the progeny of the cell when it divides. The site of integration is unpredictable, which can pose a problem. The provirus can disturb the function of cellular genes and lead to activation of oncogenes promoting the development of cancer, which raises concerns for possible applications of lentiviruses in gene therapy. However, studies have shown that lentivirus vectors have a lower tendency to integrate in places <b>that</b> <b>potentially</b> cause cancer than gamma-retroviral vectors. More specifically, one study found that lentiviral vectors did not cause either an increase in tumor incidence or an earlier onset of tumors in a mouse strain with a much higher incidence of tumors. Moreover, clinical trials that utilized lentiviral vectors to deliver gene therapy for the treatment of HIV experienced no increase in mutagenic or oncologic events.|$|E
