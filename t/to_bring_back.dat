5|$|Spotnitz {{found that}} the main problem with {{developing}} the episode was segueing from a movie that some—but not necessarily all—viewers had seen. The writers sought <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>back</b> characters like Gibson Praise, Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender who {{were not in the}} movie. In addition, the writers also wanted <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>back</b> elements that were also seen in the movie, like the alien. Carter claims to have been thinking about what the episode would entail almost two years prior, when he was working on developing The X-Files movie. The character Sandy, who is killed in the teaser sequence, was played by the show's casting director Rick Millikan on the request of Carter. Millikan later joked that he spent most of the shoot on his cell phone casting other individuals for other X-Files episodes. One of the nuclear power plant workers is named Homer, a reference to Homer Simpson, one of the main characters from the animated Fox television series The Simpsons.|$|E
