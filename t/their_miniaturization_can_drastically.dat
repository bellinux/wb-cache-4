40|$|The {{ability to}} perform {{laboratory}} operations on small scales using miniaturized devices provides numerous benefits, including reduced quantities of reagents and waste as well as increased portability and controllability of assays. These operations can involve reaction components in the solution phase and as a result, <b>their</b> <b>miniaturization</b> <b>can</b> be accomplished through microfluidic approaches. One such approach, droplet microfluidics, provides a high-throughput platform {{for a wide range}} of assays and approaches in chemistry, biology and nanotechnology. We highlight recent advances in the application of droplet microfluidics in chip-based technologies, such as single-cell analysis tools, small-scale cell cultures, in-droplet chemical synthesis, high-throughput drug screening, and nanodevice fabrication...|$|R
30|$|The {{miniaturization}} {{of components}} {{for the construction}} of useful devices is an essential feature of modern technology. <b>Their</b> <b>miniaturization</b> permits the assembly of ultra-densely integrated circuits and faster processors. However, along with the developing of silicon-based electronics, it is becoming apparent that intrinsic limitations will prevent <b>their</b> <b>miniaturization</b> down to the nanoscale. To solve these problems, an alternative and promising strategy, called the bottom-up approach, was suggested by an eminent physicist and visionary, Richard Feynman, in 1959. In the bottom-up approach, one can build nanodevices starting from atom or molecules. Via this strategy, a series of significant advances have been achieved in recent years. However many problems still exist, hampering its further development.|$|R

40|$|Artificial {{compound}} eye {{cameras are}} an attractive approach to generate imaging systems of maximum <b>miniaturization.</b> <b>Their</b> thickness <b>can</b> {{be reduced by}} a factor of two in comparison to miniaturized single aperture cameras with the same pixel size and resolution. The imaging performance of these systems can be improved significantly by the use of micro-optical refractive freeform arrays (RFFA). Due to the complexity of these non-symmetric surface profiles with sag heights larger than 50 µm in combination with extreme profile accuracies better than ?/ 14 (rms), there is no dedicated fabrication technology currently available. In the presented research, significant improvements in the fabrication of these elements with laser lithography were reached. Therefore, a laser lithographic process based on several coating steps in combination with a multiple exposure strategy was developed that is suitable for the fabrication of arbitrary freeform structures with sag heights up to 60 µm. In order to minimize surface deviations caused by unavoidable process nonlinearities, a compensation strategy based on an empirical process model is used. The achievable accuracy of the proposed method and its limitations were investigated by fabricating a spherical micro lens array for demonstration. The fabricated elements possess a shape deviation of less than 1. 3 µm (rms) and can be used as master structures for a subsequent replication process in order to realize a cost efficient mass production of artificial compound eye optics on wafer level...|$|R
