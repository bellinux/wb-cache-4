5|$|In 1985, Dallas {{electrician}} and rodeo cowboy Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) {{is diagnosed}} with AIDS and given 30 days to live. He initially refuses {{to accept the}} diagnosis, but remembers having unprotected sex {{with a woman who}} was an intravenous drug user. He is soon ostracized by family and friends and gets fired from his job, believed by family, friends and coworkers to have had homosexual relations, and is eventually evicted from his home. At the hospital, he is tended to by Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), who tells him that they are testing a drug called zidovudine (AZT), an antiretroviral drug which is thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients—and is the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for testing on humans. Dr. Saks informs him that in the clinical trials, half the patients receive the drug and the other half are given a placebo, as <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> they can determine if the drug is working.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{the player}} can find {{rustling}} patches {{of grass and}} rippling water, where they can encounter either a rare Pokémon, a Pokémon {{more common in the}} opposite game version, or the highest evolutionary form of a Pokémon whose lower forms can normally be found in the area. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to capture Pokémon such as Audino, Emolga, and Alomomola. Also, dust clouds in caves and the shadows of flying Pokémon on certain bridges can be entered to either find a rare item or encounter Drilbur, Excadrill, Ducklett, or Swanna, none of which {{can be found in the}} wild otherwise. Occasionally, when throwing a Poké Ball, the capture rate is highly increased, triggered by a random event. There are also new side-games and sidequests: the player can compete in Pokémon Musicals, a side-game similar to the Pokémon Contests of previous games; the Battle Subway, similar to the Battle Towers and Battle Frontiers of previous games; and on the Royal Unova, a cruise ship that the player can ride and fight Trainers aboard to win otherwise rare items.|$|E

25|$|Swami Vivekananda {{suggested}} {{to try to}} give up jealousy and conceit and learn to work unitedly for others. He told that purity, patience and perseverance overcome all obstacles. He {{suggested to}} take courage and work on. Patience and steady work, according to Swami Vivekananda, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to get success.|$|E
25|$|One key Ich‑Du {{relationship}} Buber identified {{was that}} which can exist between {{a human being}} and God. Buber argued that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> in which it is possible to interact with God, and that an Ich‑Du relationship with anything or anyone connects in some way with the eternal relation to God.|$|E
25|$|Every {{planar graph}} has a flat and linkless {{embedding}}: simply embed the graph into {{a plane and}} embed the plane into space. If a graph is planar, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to embed it flatly and linklessly into space: every flat embedding can be continuously deformed to lie on a flat plane. And conversely, every nonplanar linkless graph has multiple linkless embeddings.|$|E

25|$|What is {{happening}} in your countries is a terrible tragedy that must end. During the African Synod, we, the pastors of the church, felt the duty to express our consternation and to launch an appeal for forgiveness and reconciliation. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to dissipate the threats of ethnocentrism that are hovering over Africa these days and that have so brutally touched Rwanda and Burundi.|$|E
25|$|Although several {{witnesses}} came to {{the conclusion}} that the attacks could not be the work of dogs or coyotes because they had not eaten the victim, this conclusion is incorrect. Both dogs and coyotes can kill and not consume the prey, either because they are inexperienced, or due to injury or difficulty in killing the prey. The prey can survive the attack and die afterwards from internal bleeding or circulatory shock. The presence of two holes in the neck, corresponding with the canine teeth, are to be expected since <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> that most land carnivores have to catch their prey.|$|E
25|$|Poverty {{can lead}} to {{increased}} trafficking in many different ways. Poverty affects the notion of individual choice and often drives families to make decisions out of desperation and lack of education. Poverty, in some countries, may influence parents {{to send their children}} to work in another urban country with a more stable economy, such as the U.S., without the knowledge that the child is then forced into slave labor or prostitution. Furthermore, once this kidnapping and trafficking of the child occurs, the victim often accepts their situation and limits efforts to escape their imprisonment. Oftentimes, they wind up alone in a country where they do not speak the language, making it difficult to seek aid. In addition, victims often accept their positions because they feel that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> that they may send some remittances to their family and their enslaved situations may in some cases still be better than their original impoverished and desperate state.|$|E

25|$|Social class {{mobility}} {{could be}} low because of housing inequality. People who live or {{were born in}} the housing inequality, they have more problems to solve instead of making money. And what's more, Their children are less likely to get higher education in order to get into higher class in their futures. It could lower the social class mobility to our self and so does our next generation. The major problem of first generation is about earning money for family because of housing inequality. It's hard to get a loan from bank and lots of bills to pay. They just worry how to survive to tomorrow. But for our children, they deserve a better future, but under housing inequality, they need more time and money to get the same education as who are not suffering from housing inequality. These makes them give up their education easily but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> they can get into higher class in the future. Not so many of people can make it.|$|E

500|$|Sherlock {{offers to}} trade Magnussen's {{information}} on Mary {{for the state}} secrets contained in Mycroft's laptop. However, Magnussen is aware that Sherlock is setting him up in a trap. [...] Magnussen then explains Sherlock's plan to John: security services looking for the laptop using a GPS tracker it contains will raid Appledore and, upon finding the laptop, will have a legal reason to search the blackmail vaults. [...] Magnussen, with visible joy, reveals that the plan will not work because Appledore's vaults don't physically exist, but are stored in his mind palace. By giving Magnussen the laptop, Sherlock and John are now guilty of attempting to sell government secrets and can be imprisoned for high treason, whereas Magnussen remains legally untouchable. When Mycroft and the police arrive, Sherlock coldly shoots Magnussen in the head, having realised that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to free his friends and everyone else from his power.|$|E
500|$|Battles are turn-based, and {{consist of}} players letting the {{characters}} in their party attack with swords or guns, summon demons, or cast magic spells; both demons and humans, {{with the exception of}} the player character, are able to use magic. By participating in battles, human characters in the player's party receive experience points; by accumulating these points, the characters' levels rise and new abilities are randomly learned. Players can choose to talk to demons instead of fighting them; they can ask the demons for items or money, try to get them to go away, or try to form an alliance with them. At some places, called [...] "Cathedrals of Shadows", players can fuse two to three allied demons into one single, more powerful demon; as demons do not receive experience points, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> for the player to increase their demons' power. Magnetite is used as a fuel for allied demons, and is used up by summoned demons as the player character walks around in the dungeons; if players run out of magnetite, summoned demons take damage.|$|E

He contended that The modernization of Mexico is essential {{if we are to}} meet the demands of the 85 million Mexicans of today.... In brief, we need to modernize politics, the economy, and society.
