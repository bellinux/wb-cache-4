500|$|Bellomont's rule in New York was not remembered fondly. One {{political}} opponent, {{noting that}} the provincial debt rose substantially during his tenure, wrote that the memory of Bellomont [...] "will stink in the nostrills of all good men", and Robert Livingston reported that the debt was [...] "a greater Debt <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen". Bellomont's personal affairs were also difficult to tie up: his creditors tried (unsuccessfully) to prevent his wife's departure from the province in order to compel settlement of his personal debts. Bellomont's financial issues were not unique in this respect. Later governors (including Nanfan and Cornbury) were arrested on charges of malfeasance and personal indebtedness {{at the behest of}} their political opponents. New York's debt problems were not resolved until the Hunter administration in 1717.|$|E
2500|$|Some of Cronin's novels also {{deal with}} religion, {{which he had}} grown away from during his medical {{training}} and career, but which he reacquainted himself with during the 1930s. At medical school, as he recounts in his autobiography, he had become an agnostic: [...] "When I thought of God {{it was with a}} superior smile, indicative of biological scorn for such an outworn myth." [...] During his practice in Wales, however, the deep religious faith of the people he worked among made him start to wonder whether [...] "the compass of existence held more than my text-books had revealed, more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> dreamed of. In short I lost my superiority, and this, though I was not then aware of it, is the first step towards finding God." ...|$|E

2500|$|But for {{the young}} Buechner Bermuda was also a new world of [...] "magic and mystery," [...] his own {{personal}} Land of Oz. It was Prospero's island from Shakespeare's The Tempest come to life in all its spellbinding wonder. It was an island of [...] "brightness and peace" [...] that enabled him finally to see those closest to him as [...] "creatures of our own new legends," [...] {{the place where he}} discovered a best friend in his younger brother, Jamie, as they fished off the terrace of their salmon colored house in Paget—The Moorings, flew kites over the water in the harbor, and braved the pedagogical oddities of the Warwick Academy. It was on this island that was [...] "more dreamlike than any other place I have known since or ever hope to know" [...] where, sitting beside the girl whose mouth turned up at the corners on a crumbling stone wall at Salt Kettle, Buechner first felt the [...] "sweet panic and anguish" [...] of Eros.

2500|$|Wolfe has {{an aversion}} to {{physical}} contact, even shaking hands. Early in the first novel Archie explains why there is a gong under his bed that will ring upon any intrusion into or near Wolfe's own bedroom: [...] "Wolfe told me once ... that he really had no cowardice in him, he only had an intense distaste for being touched by anyone …" [...] When Jerome Berin, creator of saucisse minuit, repeatedly taps Wolfe on the knee, Archie grins at [...] "Wolfe, who didn't like being touched, concealing his squirm {{for the sake of}} sausages." [...] In Prisoner's Base, Wolfe speaks coldly as he tells the DA and Inspector Cramer that the despised Lieutenant Rowcliff [...] "put a hand on me. ... I will not have a hand put on me, gentlemen. I like no man's hand on me, and one such as Mr. Rowcliff's, unmerited, I will not have." [...] Wolfe's prejudices make it all the more surprising when, in [...] "Cordially Invited to Meet Death", Archie finds Wolfe in the kitchen with a woman who has solved the problem of preparing corned beef: [...] "Standing beside him, closer to him <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen any woman or girl of any age tolerated, with her hand slipped between his arm and his bulk, was Maryella." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{talked to}} him (Dr. Scott) for some time, and {{consulted}} him about baby, who was looking thin and weak. (15 July)This evening I was standing outside the door with baby in my arms, talking to the ayah, when I felt something whiz past my ears. (23 July)A poor woman [...] [...] [...] whose husband [...] [...] [...] had been killed during the siege, came to-day {{to ask me to}} give her a little milk for her only child, who was dying for the want of proper nourishment. It went to my heart to refuse her; but at this time I had only just enough for my own children, and baby could not have lived without it. I think she understood that I would have given her some if I could. (14 August)The children still kept pretty well, though baby grew thinner every day; nothing I gave him seemed to nourish him. (28 August)As we were starting, Major Ouvry brought us some beer to drink, and poor baby, who was very thirsty, cried louder for it <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> heard him before. With difficulty I pacified him, and succeeded in getting him to sleep. Just then the word 'Halt!' was heard, and silence was ordered, all lights to be put out. It was evident some danger was apprehended, and I shall never forget my anxiety lest baby should commence crying again, and perhaps betray our whereabouts; I hardly dared breathe.

5000|$|Meanwhile, only a {{condemned}} seamstress (Isabel Jewell) notices Carton's substitution, {{but keeps}} quiet. She draws comfort in his heroism as they {{ride in the}} same cart to the execution place. As the camera rises just before the blade falls, Carton's voice is heard, saying, [...] "It's a far, far better thing <b>I</b> do <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> done.

2500|$|... "Suddenly, I {{heard the}} clatter of Leycester's machine gun above {{the roar of the}} engine. I looked round to see what he was {{shooting}} at, and nearly had a heart attack. Slanting down from above, getting nicely into position thirty yards behind my tail, was an Albatros. [...] "I immediately heaved the old A-W round in a split-arse turn, tighter I think <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> turned before. I felt a flash of panic as I lost sight of the Hun, but Leycester must have been able to see him all right as he kept on firing. My sudden turn had done the trick. The Albatros overshot and suddenly appeared right in front of me. Because of the relative motion of our two aircraft, he seemed to hang motionless, suspended in mid-air. I could see the pilot's face as he looked back at me. I sent a two-second burst of Vickers (machine gun) fire into him. His aircraft seemed to flutter, then slid out of sight below my starboard wing. I was pretty certain that I had hit his petrol tank. Behind me, Leycester was still blazing away. He was using tracer (incendiary bullets), and it may have been one of his bullets that ignited the petrol pouring from the Hun's ruptured tank. When I caught sight of the Albatros again, it was burning like a torch and side-slipping towards the ground, trailing a streamer of smoke. For an instant I saw the German pilot, looking down {{over the side of the}} cockpit. Then the smoke and flames enveloped him." ...|$|E

Mead {{wrote about}} Blavatsky, [...] "I know {{no one who}} detested, more than she did, any attempt to hero-worship herselfshe {{positively}} physically shuddered at any expression of reverence to herselfas a spiritual teacher; I have heard her cry out in genuine alarm at an attempt to kneel to her made by an enthusiastic admirer." [...] Leo Klejn wrote about Blavatsky, [...] "Indefatigability and energy of this woman were surprising. She had a revolutionary's merits." [...] Another person who said Blavatsky was a remarkable woman was a former associate {{and publisher of the}} Theosophical magazine [...] "Lucifer" [...] 1887–1889, Mabel Collins. After leaving the movement she said [...] "She taught me one great lesson. I learned from her how foolish, how 'gullible', how easily flattered human beings are, taken en masse. Her contempt for her kind was on the same gigantic scale as everything else about her, except her marvellously delicate taper fingers. In all else, she was a big woman. She had a greater power over the weak and credulous, a greater capacity for making black appear white, a larger waist, a more voracious appetite, a more confirmed passion for tobacco, a more ceaseless and insatiable hatred for those whom she thought to be her enemies, a greater disrespect for les convenances, a worse temper, a greater command of bad language, and a greater contempt for the intelligence of her fellow-beings <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> supposed possible to be contained in one person. These, I suppose, must be reckoned as her vices, though whether a creature so indifferent to all ordinary standards of right and wrong can be held to have virtues or vices, I know not." ...|$|E
2500|$|South of the Brook, by Money Lane, the Unitarian Gravel Pit Meeting House {{was built}} between 1715 and 1716. This {{was the result}} of an acrimonious split in the {{congregation}} of the Lower Clapton meeting. Notable nonconformist ministers preached at the Old Gravel Pit. The moral and political philosopher Richard Price, known for his support of the American Revolution, became morning preacher in 1770, while continuing his afternoon sermons at Newington Green Chapel, on the green where he lived. Those who attended his sermons in Homerton included American politicians such as John Adams, who later became the second president of the United States, and his wife Abigail. On the 101st anniversary of the Glorious Revolution, he preached a sermon at Old Jewry meeting house entitled [...] "A Discourse on the Love of our Country", thus igniting a so-called [...] "pamphlet war" [...] known as the Revolution Controversy, furiously debating the issues raised by the French Revolution. Burke's rebuttal [...] "Reflections on the Revolution in France" [...] attacked Price, whose friends Thomas Paine and Mary Wollstonecraft leapt into the fray to defend their mentor. The reputation of Price for speaking without fear of the government on these political and philosophical matters drew huge crowds to his sermons, which were published and sold as pamphlets (i.e. publications easily printed and circulated). Another eminent minister was the formidable polymath, Joseph Priestley, discoverer of oxygen. When his support of dissent led to the riots named after him, he fled Birmingham and headed for London; he was appointed minister here in 1793. Today a Blue Plaque marks the site of the Gravel Pit Meeting House in Ram Place and a brown plaque marks the site of the Priestley's house at 113 Lower Clapton Road (on the corner of Clapton Passage). Priestley said of his time here, [...] "On the whole I spent my life more happily at Hackney <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> done before". The meeting house is now used as a factory.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the diary}} she often talks {{about keeping the}} [...] "boys" [...] and the [...] "baby" [...] (Alfred) safe during the siege and retreat:This was Johnny's fourth birthday, a sad one to us all. We managed to get some toys for Johnny from a {{merchant}} inside. (16 July)Johnny was not well to-day, and I feared he might be sickening for small-pox. (31 July)Johnny's rosy cheeks, which he never lost, excited great admiration; he passed {{most of his time}} in the square next to us with the Sikhs, who were very fond of him, and used to give him chappatties (native bread), though they could not have had much to eat themselves, poor men! (28 August) [...] Mrs. Case and Johnny were walking in the square next to ours to-day, when a Sikh officer passed them, and directly afterwards he was hit in the arm by a bullet. No place was really safe, and I never liked having the children out of my sight. (18 October) During the siege, we had picked up a little white hen, which used to run about and pick up what it could. Just before Colonel Campbell became so very ill, we had decided to kill and eat it, when one morning Johnny ran in and said, 'Oh, mamma, the white hen has laid an egg!' We took it at once to Colonel Campbell, it being a great luxury in those days. The hen laid one every day for him till he died, and then ceased for the rest of the siege; but we would not kill it then. (12 November) I had at first put the two boys into a dhoolie with their ayah, but they got separated from us, and it was fully a quarter of an hour before I found them, so I would not let them go from me again [...] [...] [...] poor baby, who was very thirsty, cried louder for it [...] <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> heard him before.
