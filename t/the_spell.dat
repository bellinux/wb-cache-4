5|$|Back in Arendelle, Anna (who has {{woken up}} from <b>the</b> <b>spell)</b> tried {{to track down}} a device known as a wishing star, which will {{have the power to}} bring her and Kristoff to {{wherever}} Elsa is. It was apparently the necklace Elsa had given Anna long ago, Elsa using it to bring Anna and Kristoff to Storybrooke. However, <b>the</b> <b>Spell</b> of Shattered Sight had already begun, and the only ones immune to it were Elsa, Emma, and Anna (Anna because it was already used on her a while ago). Tracking down a note written by Elsa and Anna's mother right before her death, the three bring it to Ingrid. It reads that Gerda forgave Ingrid for all that had transpired and still loved her, Ingrid realizing this was what the prophecy meant by regaining her sister's love. Realizing {{there is no point in}} killing the town now, the Snow Queen kills herself using the mirror, which deactivates the curse, though a bit of it remained in Storybrooke, reinstating the town line, making it impossible to return to town if you are to leave it.|$|E
5|$|Outside, Cavaldi survives, having donned the Grimm's faux-magic armor. He finds Will's {{body and}} recites an Italian curse, and the tower falls apart. Jake escapes, and Cavaldi informs Jake {{that he can}} break <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> and awaken Angelika with a kiss, which in turn resurrects the other girls and Will. With the menace gone and their daughters {{returned}} to them, the villagers of Marbaden celebrate and give their heart-felt thanks to the brothers.|$|E
5|$|Samantha {{takes the}} {{children}} to the park, where another child tells Lisa and Tabitha that they cannot be sisters because they have different skin colors. When they arrive home, Tabitha casts a spell on herself and Lisa so that Tabitha's skin has black spots and Lisa's skin has white spots. Lisa thereby discovers that Tabitha and Samantha are witches. When Samantha finds the two girls polka-dotted, she tells Tabitha to reverse <b>the</b> <b>spell,</b> which Tabitha unsuccessfully tries to do. Eventually, Samantha realizes that Tabitha's attempt was unsuccessful because Tabitha subconsciously wants the spots to remain so she and Lisa {{will continue to be}} sisters. Samantha tells the girls that differences in appearance won't prevent them from being sisters, and Tabitha then successfully reverses <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> just as Lisa's parents arrive to pick up Lisa.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>spelling</b> with [...] "t" [...] {{is the one}} {{preferred}} by the profession itself internationally, but <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> with [...] "c" [...] is used often enough in texts not written {{by members of the}} profession to be considered a valid variant by both American and British dictionaries. In fact, British dictionaries list <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> with [...] "c" [...] first and list <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> with [...] "t" [...] as a variant. American dictionaries list <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> with [...] "t" [...] first and <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> with [...] "c" [...] as a variant.|$|R

5|$|Unsettled by {{the power}} he's wielding, he confesses to Isabelle that he is using witchcraft, but begs her not to reject him. She expresses her love for him and implores him to repent (Robert, toi que j'aime). Robert breaks the branch and <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> it has created, and is taken into custody by Isabelle's attendants.|$|E
5|$|At the school, Ged's skills inspire admiration {{among the}} {{teachers}} {{as well as}} students. He befriends an older student named Vetch, but generally remains aloof from his fellows. Another student, Jasper, acts condescendingly towards Ged and provokes the latter's proud nature. After Jasper needles Ged during a feast, Ged challenges him to a duel. He casts a powerful spell intended to raise {{the spirit of a}} dead woman, but <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> goes awry and releases a shadow creature, which attacks Ged and scars his face. The Archmage Nemmerle banishes the shadow and saves Ged's life, although it costs Nemmerle his own.|$|E
5|$|Between 1868 and 1877, Carte {{wrote and}} {{published}} {{the music for}} a number of his own songs and instrumental works, as well as several comic operas: Doctor Ambrosias – His Secret, at St. George's Hall (1868); Marie, with librettist E. Spencer Mott, at London's Opera Comique in 1871; and Happy Hampstead, with librettist Frank Desprez, which debuted on an 1876 provincial tour and then played at the Royalty Theatre in 1877. On tour in 1871, Carte conducted Cox and Box by composer Arthur Sullivan and dramatist F. C. Burnand, in tandem with English adaptations of two Offenbach pieces, called Rose of Auvergne and Breaking <b>the</b> <b>Spell,</b> in which Carte's client Selina Dolaro appeared. Carte's musical talent would be helpful later in his career, as he was able to audition singers himself from the pianoforte.|$|E

5|$|Each side can {{construct}} {{two types}} of magical buildings, each of which produces one type of spellcaster and researches more advanced spells for that type. These advanced buildings can be constructed only with assistance from other buildings. The Human Cleric and Orc Necrolyte can both defend themselves by magic and also see distant parts of the territory for short periods. The Cleric's other spells are protective, healing the injured and making troops invisible, while the Necrolyte raises skeletons as troops and can make other units temporarily invulnerable, {{at the cost of}} severely damaging them when <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> dissipates. The Human Conjurer and Orc Warlock have energy blasts, wider-range destruction spells and the ability to summon small, venomous monsters. The Conjurer can summon a water elemental, while the Warlock can summon a demonic melee unit.|$|E
5|$|Gautier thought Heine's Wilis and Hugo's fifteen-year-old Spanish {{girl would}} make a good ballet story. His first idea was to present an empty ballroom {{glittering}} with crystal and candlelight. The Wilis would cast a spell over the floor. Giselle and other dancers would enter and whirl through the room, unable to resist <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> to keep them dancing. Giselle would try to keep her lover from partnering other girls. The Queen of the Wilis would enter, lay her cold hand on Giselle's heart and the girl would drop dead.|$|E
5|$|In a final onslaught, Bellatrix {{is killed}} and Harry reveals to Voldemort {{that he is}} alive. He {{explains}} to Voldemort the Elder Wand's loyalty transfers upon the defeat, not necessarily the killing, of its previous master. Although Voldemort believes by killing Snape he has gained the Wand's loyalty, Snape was in fact never its master. Instead, Draco Malfoy earned the Wand's loyalty when he disarmed Dumbledore just before Snape arrived. Harry believes the Elder Wand recognized Draco as its master, {{up to the point}} where Harry disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor weeks prior, and the duel will depend on whether or not the wand recognizes Harry to be its master. Voldemort attempts one final Killing Curse on Harry, but the Elder Wand refuses to act against Harry and <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> rebounds, killing Voldemort at last.|$|E

5|$|Instructed {{to become}} a wizard, Simon is told to seek out wizards in the local tavern,. He {{performs}} tasks for various people, recovering <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> book he lost, as well as locating Sordid's tower. After, gaining entry, he {{ends up in the}} tower's garden. Searching the tower, Simon helps to send some demons back to hell, and uses a teleporter {{to take him to the}} Fiery Pits of Rondor, so as to destroy Sordid's wand. Simon defeats him, and is sent back to his world. Although he assumes he had a dream, a portal opens in his bedroom, and a large gloved hand appears, taking him back through it.|$|E
5|$|Khal Drogo, delirious from an {{infection}} {{caused by the}} chest wound inflicted by Mago, falls from his saddle, {{a sign of weakness}} among the Dothraki. Daenerys takes Drogo into her tent and sends for Mirri Maz Duur to help him. However, Ser Jorah Mormont advises Daenerys that they should leave now because the Dothraki only respect the physically strong. He explains that, if Drogo dies, Qotho and the other bloodriders will fight amongst themselves to be his successor; whoever wins will kill her and her unborn child to prevent Drogo's son from growing up to be a rival. Daenerys refuses to abandon her husband, even when Mirri tells Daenerys that she cannot save him and instead advises giving Drogo a quick, clean death. In desperation, Daenerys encourages Mirri to use blood magic despite Mirri's warning about the consequences of such a spell, that only death can pay for life. Mirri brings Drogo's horse into the tent, slits its throat, orders everyone to leave, and warns that none must enter during <b>the</b> <b>spell.</b> Qotho, shocked at what Daenerys has done, tries to stop <b>the</b> <b>spell,</b> but Mormont kills him to prevent interference. Daenerys then goes into premature labor, but none of the Dothraki midwives help her, owing to their belief that she is cursed. In desperation, Mormont carries Daenerys into Drogo's tent to seek Mirri's help.|$|E
5|$|Mary was {{depicted}} by Jacobites as an unfaithful daughter who destroyed her father {{for her own}} and her husband's gain. In {{the early years of}} their reign, she was often seen as completely under <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> of her husband, but after she had temporarily governed alone during his absences abroad, she was portrayed as capable and confident. Nahum Tate's A Present for the Ladies (1692) compared her to Queen Elizabeth I. Her modesty and diffidence were praised in works such as A Dialogue Concerning Women (1691) by William Walsh, which compared her to Cincinnatus, the Roman general who took on a great task when called to do so, but then willingly abandoned power.|$|E
50|$|As {{the boys}} fall asleep, Angela taunts Maddie but {{is unable to}} enter the room due to <b>the</b> <b>spells.</b> <b>The</b> walls begin pouring with blood, washing off <b>the</b> <b>spells.</b> <b>The</b> trio attempt to re-draw <b>the</b> <b>spells</b> but are lured {{out of the room}} when the demons fake {{daylight}} in the windows. The demons attack them. Maddie and Colin rush back to the room--and Jason is caught and disemboweled by Angela--turning him into a demon.|$|R

50|$|In the Dutch-speaking {{areas in}} the south of the Netherlands, <b>the</b> Siegenbeek <b>spelling</b> was always unpopular. After Belgium {{declared}} independence in 1830, <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> was denounced as “Hollandish” and “Protestant”. <b>The</b> <b>spelling</b> situation was quite chaotic with much discussion about whether to use a or ae, oo or oó, ee or eé, ei or ey, ui or uy, ambt or ampt, u or ue, and about <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> of verbs.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, the Simpson {{family has}} barricaded {{all the doors}} and windows except for the back door, which Homer forgot to do. Several zombies break into the house: Homer sacrifices himself to give the others time to escape, but the zombies leave him when they realize he does not have enough brains for them to eat. Lisa realizes that the school library must have a book that can reverse <b>the</b> <b>spell.</b> The Simpsons arrive at the Springfield Elementary library and Bart casts the {{appropriate}} counter spell, causing all zombies to return to their graves.|$|E
5|$|On the airship, Kain appears {{and demands}} Cecil {{retrieve}} the final crystal {{in exchange for}} Rosa's life, which the party obtains with assistance from a bedridden Edward. Kain then leads the party to the Tower of Zot, where Rosa is imprisoned. At the tower's summit, Golbez takes the crystal and attempts to flee. Tellah casts Meteor to stop Golbez, sacrificing his own life in the process. However, <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> only weakens Golbez, ending his mind control of Kain. Kain helps Cecil rescue Rosa, who teleports the party out of the collapsing tower to Baron.|$|E
5|$|The c.1800 {{manuscript}} related that <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> of {{the banner}} {{meant that it}} would vanish when it was displayed for the third time. The final unfurling of the banner would either gain the clan a complete victory over their enemies or meant that the clan was to suffer total extinction. The writer of the c.1800 manuscript went on to state that the temptation for unfurling the flag for {{the third and final}} time was always resisted; and {{that at the time of}} his writing, there was not much chance of it ever being unfurled again, since it was in such a reduced state. The writer stated that of the few shreds that remained, he himself possessed a fragment.|$|E

2500|$|Much {{is made of}} the word's two spellings: {{whiskey and}} whisky. There are two schools of thought on the issue. One is that <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> {{difference}} is {{simply a matter of}} regional language convention for <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> of a word, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> varies depending on the intended audience or the background or personal preferences of the writer (like the difference between color and colour; or recognize and recognise), and the other is that <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> should depend on the style or origin of the spirit being described. There is general agreement that when quoting the proper name printed on a label, <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> on <b>the</b> label should not be altered.|$|R
5|$|The dwarfs {{return to}} their cottage and find Snow White {{seemingly}} dead, being kept in a deathlike slumber by the poison. Unwilling to bury her {{out of sight in}} the ground, they instead place her in a glass coffin trimmed with gold in a clearing in the forest. Together with the woodland creatures, they keep watch over her. A year later, a prince, who had previously met and fallen in love with Snow White, learns of her eternal sleep and visits her coffin. Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, which breaks <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> and awakens her. The dwarfs and animals all rejoice as the Prince takes Snow White to his castle.|$|E

After breaking <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> on Welton and crossing the Blinder's Way, they claim the third Key of Truth at Castle Sanguine.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>spell</b> in Turkey, however, {{proved to}} be an unhappy time for Babangida and the Ankara side chose no to pursue their {{interest}} in the player once the loan deal expired. Looking for a move away from Netherlands, Babangida came close to signing with AJ Auxerre, but received a last-minute call from Ronald Koeman and agreed to join him at Vitesse instead. Another loan move followed. First team player under Koeman, Babangida subsequently lost his place in the starting line-up, when Ronald Koeman left for Ajax and was replaced by Edward Sturing.|$|E
