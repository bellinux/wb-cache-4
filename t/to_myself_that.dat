5|$|In 1935, Barbera {{created his}} first solo-effort {{storyboard}} about a character named Kiko the Kangaroo. The storyline was of Kiko {{in an airplane}} race with another character called Dirty Dog. Terry declined to produce the story. In his autobiography, Barbera said of his efforts..."I was, quite honestly, {{not in the least}} disappointed. I had proven <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I could do a storyboard, and that I had gained the experience of presenting it. For now, that was enough."The original storyboard, which had been passed down through the Barbera family, went on sale at auction in November 2013.|$|E

[...] Interscope chairman Jimmy Iovine suggested for Furtado to work with Timbaland, who had produced Missy Elliott's [...] "Get Ur Freak On", which featured Furtado in a remix, and done a remix of Furtado's hit [...] "Turn Off the Light”.|$|E

500|$|Smith {{graduated}} from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1991 {{with a degree}} in philosophy and political science. [...] "Went straight through in four years", he explained to Under the Radar in 2003. [...] "I guess it proved <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I could do something I really didn't want to for four years. Except I did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, 'This is your one and only chance {{to go to college and}} you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did.' Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day." [...] After he graduated, he [...] "worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and legal theory".|$|E
500|$|If we {{stick to}} the Faust story – if I had been in that story – and I had sold my soul [...] for fame and fortune, and had the arrogance of [...] to not want {{to pay back the}} deal, it's taken a few years for me to {{acknowledge}} <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I was hearing: 'Manson , the hell hounds are on your trail.' And this record is my payment. This is me giving back what I was given, or took. [...] If you believe in some mythology, and you want to live by those rules, then I had to say myself: 'I'm not really doing what I set out to do,' even though I tried to convince myself that I was. I'm not regretting the last few records that I've made, but since Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death), I've not made something with [...] sheer utter fearlessness and anger and force.|$|E
500|$|Through {{the early}} 19th century, Thompson {{continued}} to trade furs throughout the Kootenay region for the North West Company, {{and for the}} few years {{when he had a}} total monopoly over the Canadian fur trade west of the Rockies, he outlawed alcoholic drinks altogether. He was known to have written [...] "I had made it a law <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> no alcohol should pass the mountains in my company". When two of Thompson's trading partners tried to make him take two barrels of rum to Kootanae House, Thompson [...] "placed the two kegs on a vicious horse and by noon the kegs were empty and in pieces, the horse rubbing his load against the rocks {{to get rid of it}} … I told them what I had done, and that I would do the same to every keg of alcohol." [...] Of course, wine, beer, rum and other intoxicating drinks were imported in time.|$|E

500|$|During {{a trip to}} California on Republican Party {{business}} {{in the summer of}} 1973, Bundy rekindled his relationship with Brooks, who marveled at his transformation into a serious, dedicated professional seemingly on the cusp of a distinguished legal and political career. He continued to date Kloepfer as well, though neither woman was aware of the other's existence. In the fall of 1973 Bundy matriculated at UPS Law School and continued courting Brooks, who flew to Seattle several times to stay with him. They discussed marriage; at one point he introduced her to Davis as his fiancée. In January 1974, however, he abruptly broke off all contact; her phone calls and letters went unreturned. Finally reaching him by phone a month later, Brooks demanded to know why Bundy had unilaterally ended their relationship without explanation. In a flat, calm voice, he replied, [...] "Stephanie, I have no idea what you mean" [...] and hung up. She never heard from him again. [...] He later explained, [...] "I just wanted to prove <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I could have married her"; but Brooks concluded in retrospect that he had deliberately planned the entire courtship and rejection in advance as vengeance for the breakup she initiated in 1968.|$|E
500|$|Oblivions {{score was}} {{composed}} by series mainstay Jeremy Soule, {{a video game}} composer whose past scores had earned him a British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award in the [...] "Game Music Category" [...] and two nominations for an Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences (AIAS) award for [...] "Original Music Composition". The official soundtrack to Oblivion, featuring 26 tracks spanning 58 minutes; it was released in March 2006, via Soule's digital distributor DirectSong. Soule had worked with Bethesda and Todd Howard during the creation of Morrowind, and, in a press release announcing his return for Oblivion, Soule repeated the words he had said during Morrowinds press release: [...] "The stunning, epic quality of The Elder Scrolls series is particularly compatible with the grand, orchestral style of music I enjoy composing the most". As in his compositions for Morrowind, Soule chose to create a soft and minimalist score {{so as not to}} wear out users' ears. Soule stated that while composing the music he did not imagine any specific characters or events; rather, he wanted it [...] "to comment on the human condition and the beauty of life". In a 2006 interview, he related that this desire came {{as a result of a}} car accident that occurred during his composition of the score. He said, [...] "I ended up rolling in my car several times on an interstate while flying headlong into oncoming traffic ... I felt no fear ... I simply just acknowledged <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I've had a good life and I would soon have to say goodbye to all of it in a matter of seconds". Soule sustained only minor injuries, but commented that his feeling during the crash—"that life is indeed precious"—remained with him throughout the rest of the composition.|$|E

According to Howard Richman in the December 2012 issue of the Golf Course Management (GCM) Magazine, Hurdzan said, [...] "I looked around, thought, 'There's no way I'm going to beat those guys.'

2500|$|At {{the time}} of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, Rice {{reportedly}} said, [...] "If we use the word 'genocide' and are seen as doing nothing, what will be the effect on the November election?" [...] She subsequently acknowledged the mistakes made at the time and felt that a debt needed repaying. The inability or failure of the Clinton administration to do anything about the genocide would form her later views on possible military interventions. She said of the experience: [...] "I swore <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> if I ever faced such a crisis again, I would come {{down on the side of}} dramatic action, going down in flames if that was required." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the biggest {{influence}} on him in comedy, Chappelle spoke highly praise to Richard Pryor, [...] "What a precedent he set. Not just as a comic, but as a dude. The fact that someone was able to open themselves wide-open like that. It's so hard to talk {{in front of people}} or to open yourself up to your closest friends. But to open yourself up for everybody: I freebase, I beat my women, I shot my car. And nobody's mad at Richard for that. They understand. Somehow they just understand. And when I was going through this thing this year, that is the example I would think <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> gave me the courage to just go back on the stage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Slug also dislikes some of {{the songs}} that he wrote before and does not perform them live, such as [...] "Vampires" [...] from 2002 album God Loves Ugly. Daley has stated, [...] "when I did get my phase of trying to figure myself out, {{there was a lot}} of tug-of-war inside of me between wanting to hate a {{particular}} woman and then feeling guilty about that. And there’s certain songs that I won’t perform anymore, because the game of tug-of-war is over and I know where I’m at". Furthermore, Slug has criticized Atmosphere's first album Overcast!, saying: [...] "It's obvious that I’m trying so fucking hard on Overcast and you can see through it and tell it's not a person it's more of an attempt at trying to fill the niche, it was like I was trying to prove <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I was a rapper." ...|$|E

2500|$|Members of the Frist {{family have}} been major donors to Princeton University, {{pledging}} a reported $25 million in 1997 {{for the construction}} of the Frist Campus Center. Frist has said that, a few years after his 1974 graduation from Princeton, [...] "I made a commitment <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> if I was ever in a position to help pull together the resources to establish a center [...] where there could be an informal exchange of ideas, and to establish an environment that is conducive to the casual exchange of information, I would do so." [...] Daniel Golden, a Wall Street Journal journalist {{and author of the book}} The Price of Admission: How America's Ruling Class Buys Its Way into Elite Colleges — and Who Gets Left Outside the Gates, has suggested that two of Frist's sons (Harrison and Bryan) were admitted to Princeton as recognition of this donation rather than their own academic and extracurricular merit.|$|E
2500|$|Walking {{home from}} school just before her tenth birthday, she was {{reportedly}} gang raped by five men. According to Satana, her attackers were never prosecuted, and it was rumored that the judge had been paid off. She tells how this prompted her to learn martial arts, such as aikido and karate. Over the next 15 years, she tracked down each rapist and exacted revenge. [...] "I made a vow <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I would someday, somehow get even with all of them," [...] she said years later. [...] "They never knew who I was until I told them." [...] Around this time, she formed a gang, [...] "the Angeles", with Italian, Jewish, and Polish girls from her neighborhood. In an interview with Psychotronic Video, [...] she said, [...] "We had leather motorcycle jackets, jeans and boots...and we kicked butt." [...] Because of frequent delinquency, she was sent to reform school. When she was 13, her parents arranged her marriage to 17-year-old John Satana in Hernando, Mississippi, which lasted nine months.|$|E
2500|$|... "'I Won't Give Up' {{was written}} selfishly.

Seeing it on the page, proving <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I understand the lesson, that I'm applying it to my life, and that I can move on. Ultimately it was about, you know, regardless of what happens in this relationship, I don't have to give up on loving this person, or loving myself, or give up on whatever my dreams are. Even though it's written through the filter of relationships, it's not necessarily specific for relationships. For me, the true meaning exists in the bridge saying 'I don't want to be someone who walks away so easily, I'm here to stay and make a difference.' That is for all of us. We all have something that we're fighting for or that we're striving for. Whether we want to coach our soccer team to victory or lose five pounds in a month, whatever it is, there's nothing too small worth fighting for and there's nothing too big worth going after." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes: The Bad, a ruthless, unfeeling, and sociopathic {{mercenary}} {{who always}} finishes {{a job he}} is paid for (which is usually finding—and killing—people). When Blondie and Tuco are captured while posing as Confederate soldiers, Angel Eyes is the Union sergeant who interrogates and has Tuco tortured, eventually learning {{the name of the}} cemetery where the gold is buried, but not the name on the tombstone. Angel Eyes forms a fleeting partnership with Blondie, but Tuco and Blondie turn on Angel Eyes when they get their chance. Originally, Leone wanted Enrico Maria Salerno (who had dubbed Eastwood's voice for the Italian versions of the Dollars Trilogy films) or Charles Bronson to play Angel Eyes, but the latter was already committed to playing in The Dirty Dozen (1967). Leone thought about working with Lee Van Cleef again: [...] "I said <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> Van Cleef had first played a romantic character in For a Few Dollars More. The idea of getting him to play a character who was the opposite of that began to appeal to me." [...] In the original working script, Angel Eyes was named [...] "Banjo", but is referred to as [...] "Sentenza" [...] (meaning [...] "Sentence" [...] or [...] "Judgement") in the Italian version. Eastwood came up with the name Angel Eyes on the set, for his gaunt appearance and expert marksmanship.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the film}} Razieh, a strong-willed {{little girl in}} Tehran, wants to buy a lucky {{goldfish}} for the upcoming Iranian New Year celebration, but struggles to get and {{hold on to the}} 500-toman banknote needed to purchase the fish. Panahi worked closely with Mohammadkhani, gaining her trust and acting out each scene for her to mimic while still adding her own personality to the performance. Panahi was most concerned about Mohammadkhani being able to cry on cue, so he would have her stare at him off camera while he started to cry, causing her to cry. Filming began in early April 1994 in Kashan, Iran and continued until early June. Panahi has stated that during the making of his feature debut he [...] "wanted to prove <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I can do the job, that I can finish a feature film successfully and get good acting out of my players." [...] He also stated that [...] "In a world where films are made with millions of dollars, we made a film about a little girl who wants to buy a fish for less than a dollar – this is what we’re trying to show." [...] In Iran, films depicting children are the most likely to avoid censorship or political controversy, and The White Balloon was screened exclusively in theatres that specialized in children's films. Because of this the film had low attendance on its initial run in Iranian theatres, with only 130,000 tickets sold.|$|E
