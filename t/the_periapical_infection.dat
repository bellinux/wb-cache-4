40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} the endodontic orthograde retreatment {{of a lower}} canine with a rare anatomy, affected by a symptomatic periapical lesion. Materials and methods: A 30 -year-old Caucasian woman came to our office reporting severe pain and swelling located at the right mandible. A two-roots/two-canals configuration was discovered for the lower canine which sustained the periapical infection; a missed lingual canal was not recognized and treated at the previous primary endodontic therapy. A full pre-operative examination and diagnosis, the application of modern endodontic strategies along {{with the use of}} magnification technologies (like the Surgical Operating Microscope - SOM) and proper disinfection protocols were employed for endodontic re-treatment. Result and conclusions: Healing of <b>the</b> <b>periapical</b> <b>infection</b> was clinically and radiographically confirmed at a 9 -month follow-up. Endodontists should know the anatomical variations of human teeth and be vigilant about them when approaching treatments. More than a single radiographic projection is recommended in the diagnostic phase. Careful procedures related to instrumentation, cleaning and filling of the entire root canal system enhance the potential for healing of apical lesions...|$|E
40|$|Fifty-seven {{adults with}} apical {{periodontitis}} were examined {{for the presence}} of nonpigmented Bacteroides species in 62 infected root canals. Nonpigmented Bacteroides species were found in 35 canals. In four cases two nonpigmented Bacteroides species and in one case three nonpigmented Bacteroides species were found. Species belonging to the B. fragilis group were not isolated. The most frequently isolated species were B. buccae (15 strains), B. oris (12 strains), and B. oralis (7 strains). alpha-Fucosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and beta-xylosidase appeared to be useful in the identification of B. buccae and B. oris. Corroding Bacteroides species were not found; all corroding strains were identified as Wolinella recta. The occurrence of nonpigmented Bacteroides species was compared with the severity of <b>the</b> <b>periapical</b> <b>infection.</b> A total of 13 B. buccae strains were found in acute infections and only 2 strains were found in asymptomatic infections, whereas other nonpigmented Bacteroides species were present in acutely infected and asymptomatic teeth with nearly equal frequency. Ultrastructural study of 13 B. buccae strains showed that 8 strains had a crystalline proteinaceous surface layer (S-layer) outside the outer membrane, but all 13 strains had areas of crystalline protein throughout in the outer membrane.

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{bacterial}} diversity in persistent apical lesions on root-filled teeth by using culture-independent molecular methods. Design: Twenty surgically removed apical lesions from therapy-resistant teeth were examined for the presence of bacterial DNA using PCR targeting the 16 s ribosomal RNA gene, followed by cloning and sequencing. Results: Bacterial DNA was detected in 17 of the 20 samples (85 %). A total of 236 clones were analyzed. Seven different bacterial phyla were represented and a total of 75 different bacterial taxa were identified; 36 % of the species have not yet been cultivated. Commonly detected bacterial species included Fusobacterium spp., Prevotella spp., Tannerella forsythia, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Treponema denticola, Bacteroidetes spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. Conclusions: A wide range of bacteria was identified in periapical lesions on therapy-resistant teeth.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the gene expression of proinflammatory (RANKL, TNF-a and IFN-g) and regulatory (TGF-b and IL- 10) cytokines as reaction to experimental infection by mono or bi-association of Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC 10953) and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 19433). F. nucleatum and E. faecalis, either in mono- or bi-association were inoculated into the root canal system (RCS) of Balb/c mice. Animals were sacrificed at 10 and 20 days after <b>infection</b> and <b>periapical</b> tissues surrounding <b>the</b> root were collected. The mRNA expression of the cytokines RANKL, TNF-a, IFN- g, TGF-b and IL- 10 was assessed using real-time PCR. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used for statistical analysis. F. nucleatum mono-infection induced high expression of RANKL and TNF-a, while its modulation was due to IL- 10. High expression of IFN-g at day 20 was up-regulated by E. faecalis and RANKL; TNF-a was up-regulated by an independent mechanism via IL- 10 and TGF-b. Bi-association (F. nucleatum and E. faecalis) stimulated high expression of RANKL, TNF-a and IFN-g, which seemed to be modulated by TGF-b 20 days later. The gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines was more prominent in the earlier periods of <b>the</b> experimental <b>periapical</b> <b>infection,</b> which concomitantly decreased in the later period.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} the antisepsis {{of the root}} canal system (RCS) and periapical region (PR) provided by rotary instrumentation associated with chlorhexidine + calcium hydroxide as intracanal medica-ment. Chronic periapical lesions were induced in 26 pre-molar roots in two dogs. After microbiological sampling, automatic instrumentation using the Profile system and irrigation with 5. 25 % sodium hypochlorite solution, with a final rinse of 14. 3 % EDTA followed by profuse irrigation with physiological saline were carried out in 18 root canals. After drying the canals, a paste based on calcium hydroxide associated with a 2 % chlorhexidine digluco-nate solution was placed inside them. After 21 days, the medication was removed, leaving the root canals empty and coronally sealed. After 96 hours, a final microbiological sample was obtained, followed by histomicrobiologi-cal processing by the Brown & Brenn method. Eight untreated root canals represented the control group (C-G). Based on the Mann-Whitney test at a confidence level of 5 % (p < 0. 05), the procedures of antisepsis used offered significant efficacy (p < 0. 05) resulting in 100. 0 % of the canals free of microorganisms.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{objectives}} of primary endodontic treatment is <b>the</b> prevention of <b>periapical</b> tissue changes which, {{in the majority of}} clinical cases in general practice, does not take place because of the availability {{of a wide range of}} precise endodontic instruments.

The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the postoperative healing process of teeth with osteolytic defects in <b>the</b> <b>periapical</b> area. Eighty-nine endodontically treated teeth (n = 89) were included in the study. The teeth with necrotic pulp and without detectable periapical lesions were successfully treated in 92. 9 % of the cases.

40|$|Objective: <b>The</b> {{presence}} of <b>periapical</b> radiolucency {{has been used}} as a criterion for endodontic treatment failure. However, in addition to the inherent limitations of radiographic examinations, radiographic interpretations are extremely subjective. Thus, this study investigated the effect of partial analysis of root filling quality and periapical status on retreatment decisions by general dentists. Material and Methods: Twelve digitalized periapical radiographs were analyzed by 10 observers. The study was conducted at three time points at 1 -week intervals. Radiographs edited with the Adobe Photoshop CS 4 software were analyzed at three time points: first, only root filling quality was analyzed; second, only <b>the</b> <b>periapical</b> areas of teeth under study were visualized; finally, observers analyzed the unedited radiographic image. Spearman’s coefficient was used to analyze the correlations between the scores assigned when <b>the</b> <b>periapical</b> area was not visible and when the unedited radiograph was analyzed, as well as between the scores assigned when root fillings where not visible and when the unedited radiograph was analyzed.

Radiological changes in <b>the</b> <b>periapical</b> radiographs are not always manifest in the early stages, and in this regard small-volume cone beam computed tomography can help us visualize such peri-implant changes. The early diagnosis of periapical implant lesions during the osseointegration phase and the provision of early treatment result in increased implant survival rates, thereby avoiding the need for implant extraction...|$|R
