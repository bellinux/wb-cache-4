5|$|Around {{the time}} as he was collaborating with Stipe, and while still a member of Oh-OK, Sweet began writing songs for another project, <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> <b>of</b> Delight, which {{consisted}} of Sweet and former Oh-OK drummer David Pierce. In October 1983, they recorded a six-song EP, Soundcastles, released {{in the spring of}} 1984 on DB Records, and performed in New York, Florida and Georgia State to promote it. In the summer and November 1984, <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> <b>of</b> Delight recorded more songs, none of which were immediately released. (In 1990, one previously unreleased Buzz of Delight track appeared on the DB Records compilation Squares Blot out the Sun, and, in 2002, three others on To Understand.) Meanwhile, Stipe continued his work with R.E.M., who were getting acclaim and success with their album Murmur. In 1983, it was named album of the year by Rolling Stone and Trouser Press, and by the middle of 1984, it had sold 200,000 copies. In November 1983, R.E.M. began recording their follow-up, Reckoning.|$|E
25|$|Originally Edwin {{planned to}} launch five stores in key cities like London, but {{although}} they signed an initial deal on 4 June 1990 that was ratified that October, Edwin did not {{gain control of}} the Fiorucci assets until May 1992. In fact they would later lose the rights to the Fiorucci name in Canada on the grounds of disuse. However, one of Edwin's first acts was a deal with Coles Myer that would see 68 Fiorucci concessions in stores across Australia. They opened a new store in Piazza San Babila, Milan in early 1993, that included a variety of branded boutiques. It took them longer to get things going in North America, after a 1993 deal with Mary Ann Wheaton of Wheaton International fell through. In 1995 they licensed the rights for eyewear in the US to Swan International Optical, and then opened a US office in September 1997. However, the strategy of their licensee, Stephen Budd, to sell the brand into US department stores didn't work out so in 1999 they announced a plan to open a New York store once again. The initial plan was to open in time for Christmas 1999, but the store on lower Broadway finally opened its doors in June 2001. Commentators such as Kim Hastreiter were sceptical that it could recapture <b>the</b> <b>buzz</b> <b>of</b> times past, given the increased competition in mass-market clubbing gear from the likes of H and The Limited.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the Buzz {{continued}} its practice of passing on drafting a marquee player. Despite being the defending WTT champions, the Buzz did not protect {{any of their}} players from the previous year's team. Instead, it drafted four new players in the roster draft and put together the youngest team in WTT history. In the order selected, the players drafted by the Buzz and their ages {{at the time were}} Sloane Stephens, 16, Christina McHale, 16, Evan King, 17, and Alex Domijan, 17. Roger Smith, who played for the OTBzz in their inaugural 1995 season was named the new Buzz coach. After the roster draft, Buzz owner Nitty Singh said, “We are extremely excited to showcase America’s finest juniors on our New York Buzz team this season. This keeps with our tradition of presenting the game’s future stars such as Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras and Lindsay Davenport who also played tournaments here in the Capital Region during the early part of their careers.” With three of their four regular full-time players having other commitments during the season, none of them other than Domijan were able to play in every match. The Buzz ended up using 13 different players in 2009, all of which were young amateurs. The optimism {{at the outset of the}} season evolved into the chaos of a rotating door through which players came and went resulting in a record for <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> <b>of</b> 4 wins and 10 losses, fourth in the Eastern Conference and barely avoided a last place finish by winning a standings tiebreaker over the Philadelphia Freedoms.|$|E

Offering contemporary British cooking and encapsulating <b>the</b> <b>buzz</b> <b>of</b> the surrounding area, Tredwells {{has become one of}} the most exciting destinations in Seven Dials. The Evening Standard Magazine's Grace Dent reviewed the restaurant on 22 October 2014 describing it as [...] "Comfort food heaven".|$|E
500|$|American Beauty {{was widely}} {{considered}} the best film of 1999 by the American press. It received overwhelming praise, chiefly for Spacey, Mendes and Ball. Variety reported that [...] "no other 1999 movie has benefited from such universal raves." [...] It was the best-received title at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), where it won the People's Choice award after a ballot of the festival's audiences. TIFF's director, Piers Handling, said, [...] "American Beauty was <b>the</b> <b>buzz</b> <b>of</b> the festival, the film most talked-about." ...|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} effects, the soundtrack was remixed. Ambient noise such as <b>the</b> <b>buzz</b> <b>of</b> bridge {{controls}} {{were added to}} enhance certain scenes. Goldsmith had always suspected that some overly long cues could be shortened, so he made the cues repetitive. Although no new scenes were added, the MPAA rated the revised edition [...] "PG" [...] {{in contrast to the}} [...] "G" [...] rating of the original release. Fein attributed the rating change to the more [...] "intense" [...] sound mix that made scenes such as the central part of V'Ger [...] "more menacing".|$|E

It sold 500,000 copies domestically, earning Platinum status in the UK, and has sold over a million copies worldwide. NME writer Steve Sutherland gave the album a nine-out-of-ten rating. He wrote, [...] "They play with the skill and {{assurance}} of a band who've been going for decades yet they still burn off <b>the</b> <b>buzz</b> <b>of</b> being new to the game." [...] He added, [...] "There's nothing contrived about I Should Coco, nothing added for effect." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{pilot of}} Friday Night Lights {{received}} good to middling reviews. Virginia Heffernan of The New York Times gave the episode {{a very good}} review, and suggested the series could {{be good enough to}} transcend the medium of television. She praised the [...] "intelligent performances" [...] of the actors, and though she found the [...] "Smash" [...] Williams character less convincing than the others, she thought it improved towards the end. She also appreciated the use of audio to tell the story: <b>the</b> <b>buzz</b> <b>of</b> a surgeon's saw or the sound of skin stuck to leather. Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club, wrote [...] "I appreciate the feel for the high stakes attached to small-market school sports, the knowing take on the high-school caste system, and the details of family life." [...] Still, he worried that America was [...] "failing to fall in love with" [...] the show, and expressed doubts as to whether it would be allowed to survive.|$|E
500|$|Sweet began {{distancing}} {{himself from}} {{other people in the}} Athens music scene and in 1984 quit Oh-OK; by 1985, <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> <b>of</b> Delight had broken up. That year, Sweet got a record deal with CBS Records and moved to New York City. He was accused of being opportunistic and using his Athens connections to get a record deal and leave. Sweet maintains that when he went to CBS, he never claimed {{to have anything to do}} with Athens, so that nobody could say he used the town. He says that after months of living in Athens, he realized things weren't as happy there as everyone pretended, and that there was backstabbing going on. In 1993, he said, [...] "Things really turned dark there when R.E.M. got famous, because everyone wanted that fame so bad. Maybe I wanted it too, but I had this musical goal all of my own and wasn't going to go along with the way it was done there." [...] Everybody was telling him that he should be touring and building up a following before doing his record, like R.E.M. had done. However, more than making the record itself and becoming a rock star, Sweet's main motivation was to get money to buy studio gear.|$|E

500|$|In {{the popular}} {{music of the}} early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, and {{engineers}} to freely experiment with musical form, arrangements, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects. Some {{of the best known}} examples are Phil Spector's Wall of Sound production formula and Joe Meek's use of homemade electronics for acts like the Tornados. XTC's Andy Partridge interprets the music of psychedelic groups as a [...] "grown-up" [...] version of children's novelty records, believing that many acts were trying to emulate those records that they grew up with; [...] "They use exactly the same techniques—sped-up bits, slowed-down bits, too much echo, too much reverb, that bit goes backwards. ... There was no transition to be made. You go from things like 'Flying Purple People Eater' to 'I Am the Walrus'. They go hand-in-hand." [...] Music critic Richie Unterberger says that attempts to [...] "pin down" [...] the first psychedelic record are therefore [...] "nearly as elusive as trying to name the first rock & roll record". Some of the [...] "far-fetched claims" [...] include the instrumental [...] "Telstar" [...] (produced by Meek for the Tornados in 1962) and the Dave Clark Five's [...] "massively reverb-laden" [...] "Any Way You Want It" [...] (1964). The first mention of LSD on a rock record was the Gamblers' 1960 surf instrumental [...] "LSD 25". A 1962 single by The Ventures, [...] "The 2000 Pound Bee", issued forth <b>the</b> <b>buzz</b> <b>of</b> a distorted, [...] "fuzztone" [...] guitar, and the quest into [...] "the possibilities of heavy, transistorised distortion" [...] and other effects, like improved reverb and echo began in earnest on London's fertile rock 'n' roll scene. By 1964 fuzztone could be heard on singles by P.J. Proby, and the Beatles had employed feedback in [...] "I Feel Fine", their 6th consecutive No. 1 hit in the UK.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the early}} 1980s progressed {{it became clear}} that the new {{generation}} of rockers were not like anything before: Los Violadores pioneering punk in Latin America; Virus oxygenating rock with their new-wave sound, followed by Cosméticos with a similar style Sumo's punkish reggae-rock developing a fanatical cult following (Luca Prodan sung mostly in English, which reduced his band's radio exposure yet their fame expanded unabated); and Soda Stereo <b>the</b> <b>buzz</b> <b>of</b> the underground. ZAS introduced the phrase [...] "rock en tu idioma" [...] (rock in your language). Los Abuelos de la Nada and newcomers G.I.T. found quick success outside Argentina, a preview of things to come.|$|E

2500|$|Social {{networking}} {{sites such}} as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, MySpace etc. have all influenced <b>the</b> <b>buzz</b> <b>of</b> word of mouth marketing. In 1999, Misner said that word-of mouth marketing is, [...] "the world's most effective, yet least understood marketing strategy" [...] (Trusov, Bucklin, & Pauwels, 2009, p.3). Through the influence of opinion leaders, the increased online [...] "buzz" [...] of [...] "word-of-mouth" [...] marketing that a product, service or companies are experiencing {{is due to the}} rise in use of social media and smartphones. Businesses and marketers have noticed that, [...] "a persons behaviour is influenced by many small groups" [...] (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.189). These small groups rotate around social networking accounts that are run by influential people (opinion leaders or [...] "thought leaders") who have followers of groups. The types of groups (followers) are called: reference groups (people who know each other either face-to-face or have an indirect influence on a persons attitude or behaviour); membership groups (a person has a direct influence on a person's attitude or behaviour); and aspirational groups (groups which an individual wishes to belong to).|$|E
2500|$|The track [...] "Riding the Crest", {{named by}} Paul Waaktaar-Savoy as [...] "an electro-blues", is heavily {{inspired}} by Arcade Fire and their album Neon Bible.

[...] "“Shadowside“ feels quite Norwegian in the melody, the chords and the mood. [...] "The Bandstand" [...] {{reminds me of my}} first trip to New York City in the early '80s, before A-ha were famous. Songs are like a photo-album – they can really send you back. And this one reminds me of arriving at Port Authority with [...] in my pocket, sporting really high, yellow, almost see-through synthesizer-hair, wearing a tiger-shirt and a brown suit, looking like an alien!" [...] The title track, [...] "Foot of the Mountain" [...] – examines one of the fundamental conflicts of modern life, the pull between nature and big-city civilization: for Paul, <b>the</b> <b>buzz</b> <b>of</b> New York City versus the beauty and isolation of Norway: [...] "It's the dilemma of loving a city life, yet secretly wondering if we'd be happier being surrounded by open fields and sweeping mountains." [...] "Real Meaning" [...] is inspired by Waaktaar-Savoy calling home only to be greeted by his answering machine. The idea behind [...] "Start the Simulator" [...] was to make a heartfelt song using technical language: [...] "The basic idea was to make a song using only technical terms and phrases, and still make it very emotional and personal. There is such poetry in the old Apollo manuals: [...] "switch to Omni Bravo" [...] and [...] "the bright ejector blanket." [...] The latter should probably be [...] "ejecta blanket." ...|$|E
