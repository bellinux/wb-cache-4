5|$|This double {{disaster}} {{destroyed the}} Pope's plans for <b>the</b> <b>crusade,</b> {{as he had}} envisaged it to land in Theodore's rear while he was engaged with Robert's army.

In November, the Pope was forced to postpone <b>the</b> <b>crusade's</b> departure for <b>the</b> next spring. With news of the Latin defeats and the postponement of <b>the</b> <b>crusade,</b> <b>the</b> exhausted defenders of Thessalonica surrendered the city to Theodore sometime in December 1224. <b>The</b> <b>crusade</b> to relieve it sailed in March 1225, and landed in Thessaly at Halmyros. The Crusader army was soon decimated by dysentery, allegedly because the Greeks had poisoned the local water supply. William of Montferrat himself succumbed to it, and {{the remnants of the}} army left Greece. Demetrius of Montferrat still hoped to recover his realm with the help of Frederick II, but died in 1227.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>crusades</b> were {{intended}} to seize Jerusalem from Muslim control. The First Crusade was proclaimed by Pope Urban II (pope 1088–99) at the Council of Clermont in 1095 {{in response to a}} request from the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118) for aid against further Muslim advances. Urban promised indulgence to anyone who took part. Tens of thousands of people from all levels of society mobilised across Europe and captured Jerusalem in 1099. One feature of <b>the</b> <b>crusades</b> was the pogroms against local Jews that often took place as the crusaders left their countries for the East. These were especially brutal during the First Crusade, when the Jewish communities in Cologne, Mainz, and Worms were destroyed, and other communities in cities between the rivers Seine and Rhine suffered destruction. Another outgrowth of <b>the</b> <b>crusades</b> was the foundation of a new type of monastic order, the military orders of the Templars and Hospitallers, which fused monastic life with military service.|$|E
