40|$|Nanoelectromechanical (NEM) {{switches}} exhibit abrupt switching {{behavior and}} near-zero leakage current making them promising alternatives to conventional semiconductor switches. However, they require high actuation voltages and commonly suffer from permanent adhesion of device components leading to failure. This thesis proposes a novel NEM switch, or "squitch", that overcomes these challenges by electromechanical modulation of tunneling current through a nanometer-thick gap defined by an organic thin-film sandwiched between two electrodes. The switching is initiated by an applied voltage compressing the organic film {{to reduce the}} tunneling width leading to an exponential increase in the tunneling current. The deformed organic material prevents direct contact of the electrodes, while also providing the restoring force necessary to <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> when the electrostatic force is removed, mitigating stiction-induced failure. In this thesis, the feasibility of the proposed switching mechanism is investigated through theoretical analysis of two- and three-terminal devices, demonstrating the possibility of energy efficient operation in the sub- 1 V regime, with nanoseconds switching time and a large on-off current ratio of greater than 106. Based on the theoretical studies, design requirements are identified to guide the fabrication process of the proposed devices. Various methods of fabricating these devices have been developed, the details of which are outlined in this work. by Farnaz Niroui. Thesis (S. M.)

30|$|The energy {{conservation}} measures (ECM) in Table  7 {{show that in}} test case House F, the unplugging of un-used electrical appliances could lower the electricity consumption of the house by 10  %. As 60  % of the house energy consumption is for electrical appliances, unplugging them rather than just simply <b>turning</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> has {{a significant effect on}} the house’s electricity consumption. Awareness of this habit is very important to Philippine household owners. Furthermore, using an energy efficient lighting system, particularly the light-emitting diode (LED) lamp could save lighting electricity consumption by up to 69  % as represented by House G. In the Philippine middle to upper class houses, most of the lightings are the florescent-based lamps. In terms of prices, the current price of LED light bulb is around ₱ 85 per watt ($ 1.9 /W) compared to ₱ 10 per watt ($ 0.2 /W). However, in terms of lamp lifespan, the LED light is 30, 000  h compared to 8000  h for the CFL. Hence, price is another factor for mass application of LED lighting. Using a high overall heat transfer coefficient material on the first floor could help support the cooling requirement of the house. The house saves fan and pump energy consumption from the low-grade geothermal cooling of the air supply. Hence, these {{energy conservation}} measures {{have an effect on the}} energy consumption of the house and are important for the development of energy efficient houses for tropical Philippines. Based on the study’s overall results, the present Philippine single family house (House A) needs more improvement in its thermal performance and energy conservation measures. In addition, utilization of alternative energy sources and application of new air-conditioning technologies are important to minimize the house’s energy supply from the grid line and maximize energy conservation. Energy conservation measures (ECM) such as unplugging of un-used electrical appliances are important and are the simplest way to save electricity. Another important measure is to use a high energy efficient lighting system to save more energy for the lighting requirement.|$|R

40|$|Ohmic nanoswitches {{have been}} {{recently}} regarded to complement transistors in applications where electrical current leakage {{is becoming a}} problem. Although the solid state metal oxide silicon field effect transistor (MOSFET) has fueled a global technology revolution, it is now reaching its performance limits because of device leakage. To avoid electric field-induced damage in MOSFETs, operating voltage and hence threshold voltage must be reduced as linewidth is reduced. However, below a limit, the current cannot be <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> ohmic <b>switch</b> approach solves this problem because an air gap that separates the electrical contacts provides excellent electrical isolation when the relay is open. Some applications require these relays to perform billions to trillions of cycles, yet typical devices that are exposed to ambient environment degrade electrically {{after just a few}} thousand cycles. A critical challenge here is that trace amounts of volatile hydrocarbons in air adsorb on the electrical contact surfaces for a large variety of coating materials, causing an insulating deposit to form that prevents signal transmission during switch closure. We address this challenge by exploring the interactions of hydrocarbon contaminants with contact materials and operating environment on device lifetime. Our materials of choice are Pt, a common contact material in switch applications due to its resistance to wear, and RuO 2, which is believed to be somewhat resistant to hydrocarbon adsorption. We test our devices in N 2 and O 2 background environments with controlled hydrocarbon contaminant concentrations. We illustrate that the insulating hydrocarbon deposit can be electrically broken down and its resistance lowered. We show how electrical contacts that have degraded electrically due to contamination can have their performance restored to the original level by actuating them in clean N 2 -O 2 environment. It is then shown how this process creates a highly conductive carbonaceous deposit that protects the contact from wear. It is also v demonstrated that RuO 2 does not exhibit contaminant-induced degradation even at very high hydrocarbon presence, as long as O 2 is also present. These results show that even though the contaminant is ubiquitous in the environment, {{there are many ways to}} reduce its effect on ohmic switches...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{design and}} {{development}} of a ubiquitous tracking system is proposed, in which vehicles are tracked and controlled using the prevailing cellular technologies. The system contains a GPS receiver and a GSM modem interfaced with a microcontroller. To track any vehicle, the vehicle's owner has to send an SMS to the tracking system installed inside the vehicle. Upon receiving the SMS, the microcontroller takes the current location's longitude and latitude coordinates from GPS receiver, packs it into an SMS and sends it to the owner and on a web server using GSM modem. When the web server receives the SMS containing vehicles coordinates, it will show location of the vehicle on Google Maps. For android users, the location is also displayed on an android application. In case of vehicle theft, the owner is able to <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> main ignition <b>switch,</b> check status and {{speed of the vehicle}} simply by sending an SMS. The system is also equipped with a special security button for parked vehicles. By turning the button ON, the system will come in ACTIVE mode and will keep a special check on the vehicle's movement meanwhile performing the normal tasks. If the system senses any movement of vehicle during the ACTIVE mode, it will <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> main ignition <b>OFF</b> and will inform the owner immediately be sending 5 SMSs. Record of the vehicle's movement will be continuously managed on the web server where each owner will have vehicle's account. We have used a wide number of technologies including, but not limited to, Global Positioning System (GPS), Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) and Microcontroller...|$|R
40|$|Present work {{deals with}} the {{modeling}} and control of Low side Active Clamp Forward Converter with Synchronous rectification which is highly popular in telecommunication and point of use power supplies. The Forward converter is an isolated dc-dc buck converter and can provide wide range of output voltages based on the transformer turns ratio and duty cycle. The Forward converter is widely used as it provides galvanic isolation between input and output, simple, and gives high efficiency. The tertiary reset forward converter topology has limitation of duty cycle to 0. 5 due to saturation and hard switching which causes voltage spikes during turn on and <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> of <b>the</b> MOSFET <b>switch</b> causing power loss. In order to overcome the saturation phenomena a clamp capacitor along with a MOSFET switch is connected in the primary to reset the transformer magnetizing inductance and ZVS phenomena takes place due to the resonance between the resonant inductance and resonant capacitance i. e., sum of the parasitic capacitance of <b>the</b> <b>switches</b> and transformer resulting in soft <b>switching.</b> In <b>the</b> secondary side of the forward converter the diodes are replaced with synchronous rectifiers resulting in low power loss. The steady state and transient analysis of the Low side Active Clamp Forward Converter topology with self-driven Synchronous Rectification has been analyzed in detail. The design of the topology was done and ZVS <b>switching,</b> reset of <b>the</b> transformer magnetizing inductance has been studied. The small signal modeling of the proposed converter topology under ideal conditions has been done and the control to output transfer function was derived using state space averaging model analysis. The PID controller is designed using frequency domain analysis to obtain. A single output voltage mode controlled Low side ACFC is designed and implemented in PSPIC...|$|R
40|$|A {{new theory}} of quasars is {{presented}} in which the matter of thin accretion disks around black holes is supplied by stars that plunge through the disk. Stars in {{the central part of}} the host galaxy are randomly perturbed to highly radial orbits, and as they repeatedly cross the disk they lose orbital energy by drag, eventually merging into the disk. Requiring the rate of stellar mass capture to equal the mass accretion rate into the black hole, a relation between the black hole mass and the stellar velocity dispersion is predicted of the form M_BH∝ sigma_*^ 30 / 7. The normalization depends on various uncertain parameters such as the disk viscosity, but is consistent with observation for reasonable assumptions. We show that a seed central black hole in a newly formed stellar system can grow at the Eddington rate up to this predicted mass via stellar captures by the accretion disk. Once this mass is reached, star captures are insufficient to maintain an Eddington accretion rate, and the quasar may naturally <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> as <b>the</b> accretion <b>switches</b> to a low-efficiency advection mode. The model provides a mechanism to deliver mass to the accretion disk at small radius, probably solving the problem of gravitational instability to star formation in the disk at large radius. We note that the matter from stars that is incorporated to the disk has an average specific angular momentum that is very small or opposite to that of the disk, and discuss how a rotating disk may be maintained as it captures this matter if a small fraction of the accreted mass comes from stellar winds that form a disk extending to larger radius. We propose several observational tests and consequences of this theory. Comment: submitted to Ap...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{interest}} for parallel multicell converters has grown, which is partially {{due to the}} possibility of coupling the inductors used to connect the different commutation cells together. Coupling the inductors to form an InterCell Transformer (ICT) does not usually modify the output current, but it reduces the current ripple in the windings and the flux swing in some regions of the core. It can be shown that this brings a reduction of copper and core losses in the magnetic component. The reduction of the phase current ripple also reduces the difference between turn on and <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> current in <b>the</b> <b>switches,</b> which brings a reduction of switching losses for devices generating more losses at <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> than at <b>turn</b> on. The design of an ICT is not that different from any other magnetic component but it is very specific and inherent features must be taken into account. Taking full benefit of the potential advantages of ICTs requires the development of special tools and methods which are the focus of the study. We show how to design ICTs considering several topologies and different methods, from the most precise and time-consuming to the less accurate but more quickly calculated. The explanation of the ICT design is divided in four main parts: Copper Losses, Core Losses, Flux Density Saturation and Thermal Aspects. Further attention is given to high frequency copper losses since complex phenomena such as skin and proximity effects highly influence the ICT design. Based on Finite Element Method simulations, smart practices are suggested to reduce high and low frequency copper losses, not only in ICTs but also in inductors and transformers. Simple tables are developed to help transformer designers to identify the best configuration of conductors inside a given core window, depending on the current waveform and frequency, number of turns and geometrical parameters. Optimization routines to reduce the ICT total mass, volume, losses or cost are developed and multidimensional interpolation of pre-simulated values of AC resistance and leakage inductance is used to speed up the optimization routine. Comparison of ICT designs with regard to core and conductor material, number of cells and switching frequency is performed. Comparison with regular inductors is also made in order to verify the benefits of this kind of magnetic component. Multilevel converter control aspects applied to three- hase systems is also investigated in terms of the ICT flux. Zero sequence signals, specific for a PWM strategy and converter/load topology, are created in order to minimize the flux in ICTs and consequently reduce even further the mass and size of these components. Comparison between several PWM methods are performed and experimentally verified...|$|R
