This meant that the Egmont Box Company would need to spend a very large {{amount of money to}} change the route to that now required to join up with the NZR line at Kakahi. This was money the company did not have and nor did the Tongariro Timber Company.

Hodgson had no troops to spare for defence {{on the south side}} and ordered him to protect his flank and rear with two squadrons of the 6th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade) and to put in his reserve regiment in one last attack on El Howeij. The mounted yeomanry <b>tried</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> force their way towards Shunet Nimrin, but the configuration of the ground continually forced them into defiles swept by machine gun fire and across open ridges where well placed artillery exacted its toll. Their advance was finally halted well short of its objective.|$|E
25|$|On 2 March 1880, on his {{way from}} London to Switzerland, Gordon had visited King Leopold II of Belgium in Brussels and was invited {{to take charge of}} the Congo Free State. Leopold <b>tried</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> {{convince}} Gordon to enter his service, not least because Gordon was known to be modest in his salary demands, unlike Leopold's current agent in the Congo, Henry Morton Stanley, who received a monthly salary of 300,000 Belgian francs. Gordon rejected Leopold's offers, partly because he was still emotionally attached to the Sudan and partly because he disliked the idea of working for Leopold's Congo Association, which was a private company owned by the King. In April, the government of the Cape Colony offered him the position of commandant of the Cape local forces, which Gordon declined. A deeply depressed Gordon wrote in his letter declining the offer that he knew, for reasons that he refused to explain, that he had only ten years left to live, and he wanted to do something great and grand in his last ten years.|$|E

2500|$|Hearing Callas in Norma in 1952] was a shock, a {{wonderful}} shock. You just got shivers {{up and down}} the spine. It was a bigger sound in those earlier performances, before she lost weight.

But when she lost the weight, she couldn't seem to sustain the great sound that she had made, and the body seemed to be too frail to support that sound that she was making. Oh, but it was oh so exciting. It was thrilling. I don't think that anyone who heard Callas after 1955 really heard the Callas voice.|$|E
2500|$|In Shakespeare's histories, the Grand Mechanism is {{manifested}} nowhere {{more clearly than}} in {{the rise and fall}} of Richard III. Kott argued that [...] "Richard is impersonal like history itself. He is the consciousness and mastermind of the Grand Mechanism. He puts in motion the roller of history, and later is crushed by it. Psychology does not apply to him. He is just history, one of its ever-repeating characters. He has no face." [...] This concept of Richard as a faceless personification of the process of a cyclical history became extremely important in Ian Holm's performance. Whilst some critics felt that Holm was physically too slight to play such a 'large' character, this was precisely the point. Holm's Richard is not the dominating larger-than-life presence of the third play as he appears on the page, but is instead a small figure, nurtured by, trapped within and ultimately destroyed by the times that have produced him. Holm himself has stated [...] "I played Richard very much as a cog in the historical wheel, and not as an individual character.

2500|$|Ramachandran {{made his}} film debut in 1936, {{in the film}} Sathi Leelavathi, {{directed}} by Ellis Dungan, an American-born film director. Generally starring in romance or action films, MGR got his big breakthrough in the 1950 film Manthiri Kumari, written by M. Karunanidhi. Soon he rose to popularity with the 1954 [...] Malaikkallan. He acted as hero in the Tamil film industry's first ever Gevacolor movie, the 1955 [...] Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum. He rose to become the heartthrob of millions of tamilians with movies such as Thirudadhe, Enga Veettu Pillai, Aayirathil Oruvan, Anbe Vaa, Mahadevi, Panam Padaithavan, Ulagam Sutrum Vaalibhan, etc. He won the National Film Award for Best Actor for the film Rickshawkaran in 1972. He acted in many movies that appealed to the direct sentiments of the common man and the rich as well. His 1973 blockbuster Ulagam Sutrum Vaalibhan broke previous box office records of his movies. It {{was one of the}} few movies filmed abroad in those days. It was shot in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong and Japan.

2500|$|Saxony was {{a center}} of völkisch {{activity}} in the late 19th century, and in the elections to the Saxon Landtag in 1893, völkisch candidates won 6 out of the 16 seats. Chamberlain's status as an immigrant to Germany always meant he was {{to a certain extent}} an outsider in his adopted country-a man who spoke fluent German, but always with an English accent. In a classic case of being plus royaliste que le roi (more royalist than the kings), Chamberlain <b>tried</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> be more German than the Germans, and it was his efforts to fit in that led him to völkisch politics. Likewise, his anti-Semitism allowed him to define himself as a German in opposition to a group that allegedly threatened all Germans, thereby allowing him to integrate better into the Wagnerian circles with whom he socialized most of the time. Chamberlain's friend Hermann Keyserling later recalled that Chamberlain was an eccentric English [...] "individualist" [...] who [...] "never saw Germany as it really is", instead having an idealized, almost mythic view of Germany and the Germans. This was especially the case as initially the German Wagnerites had rejected Chamberlain, telling him that only Germans could really understand Wagner, statements that very much hurt Chamberlain. To compensate, Chamberlain became über deutsche, the man who wanted to be more German than the Germans.|$|E
2500|$|Later, the Eleventh Doctor {{entered his}} own {{timeline}} in [...] "The Name of the Doctor" [...] to rescue his companion Clara Oswald, {{and while there}} observed a past incarnation portrayed by John Hurt, one whose actions caused him to be unworthy of the name [...] "Doctor" [...] and viewed as shameful by his future selves. In the 50th anniversary special, [...] "The Day of the Doctor", the Eleventh Doctor encounters both the Tenth Doctor and the War Doctor (played by John Hurt). [...] The Tenth and Eleventh Doctors are generally amicable towards each other, despite bickering, although the War Doctor treats them both as behaving too childishly. Despite this, he does come to admire both of his future incarnations, working together with them and eventually choosing {{to go through with}} the act of destroying Gallifrey because he knows it will help them become what they are. The Tenth and Eleventh are initially leery of the War Doctor, the Eleventh describing him as the [...] "one life I have <b>tried</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> forget." [...] However, both of them later recognise that the War Doctor followed what seemed to be the only course open to him, and are even willing to help him carry it out so that he won't have to suffer the guilt alone. Fortunately, with influence from the Moment [...] a sentient Time Lord weapon that brought about their meeting [...] the three are able to stumble upon an alternative: sending Gallifrey into a pocket universe, making it seem as though it has been destroyed. The three are then joined by the other nine previous Doctors and the future Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi) in this act (the War, Tenth and Eleventh Doctors having evidently contacted them off-screen). The Eleventh Doctor is shown to have memories of these events, but only recalls them after they have begun. This is explained in dialogue as an instability in the timeline, which causes the War and Tenth Doctors to forget their meeting, thus maintaining the continuity in which the Doctors from the War Doctor onwards believe themselves to have destroyed Gallifrey.|$|E

2500|$|Artists {{from the}} metal and hard rock {{community}} also paid homage to Jackson. Metallica {{paid tribute to}} Jackson during its encore at the Sonisphere Festival. Honoring Michael Jackson during its July 4 headlining appearance at the event, the band played a portion of 'Beat It' before easing into a riotous cover of Queen's 'Stone Cold Crazy'. Boston hard rockers Extreme performed a cover version of Jacksons's [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin" [...] at the Midnight Rodeo in Amarillo, Texas. Judas Priest bassist Ian Hill, spoke about Jackson in an interview for an internet blog: [...] "He was an immense star, wasn't he? Let's face it. He's a worldwide superstar really and the grief that everybody's is showing, it doesn't surprise me at all. He was a very, very talented man." [...] Members of the legendary metal band Black Sabbath released official statements regarding Jackson's death. Drummer Bill Ward: [...] "For those in heartache today, I wish you all wellness in healing. A great entertainer has died. I think those who experienced and heard his heart are more enlightened people for it than before. I believe you're all most fortunate to have connected to Michael Jackson." [...] Bassist Geezer Butler: [...] "Saddened and shocked to hear of the passing of Michael Jackson. He truly was, and always will be, a true icon. 'Thriller' {{was one of the}} greatest pop masterpieces of all time. A sad day for our world. R.I.P." [...] Legendary shock rocker, Alice Cooper released the following statement: [...] "Michael Jackson was easily as influential as James Brown, and that's saying a lot. We had Vincent Price in common. I used him first on 'Welcome To My Nightmare' in 1975, and he later used him on 'Thriller'. Nobody moved like Michael, he was truly the King of Pop." [...] Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen, who worked with Jackson during the recording of Thriller, stated: [...] "I am really shocked; as I'm sure the world is, to hear the news. I had the pleasure of working with Michael on 'Beat It' back in '83 — one of my fondest memories in my career. Michael will be missed and may he rest in peace." [...] Queen guitarist Brian May stated in his official website: [...] "Hard to know what to say — what to feel. I find myself wondering what might have happened on his tour... The number of dates in the U.K. that he had committed to was insane. I did have a feeling it was impossible, but I was so shocked to hear that he went so suddenly. Very sad. Of course, I still think of him as a boy — he used to come and see us (Queen) play when we were on tour in the States, and he and Freddie Mercury became close friends, close enough to record a couple of tracks together at Michael's house. Tracks which have never seen the light of day. Michael was the boy star of the Jackson Five, and always the most screamed at. I remember in their show, they <b>tried</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> make all the brothers equal in the presentation, but it was abundantly obvious that all most of the girl fans really wanted to see was little Michael. It was Michael who heard our track 'Another One Bites the Dust' when he came to see us on 'The Game' tour ... and told us we were mad if we didn't release it as a single." [...] Former Guns n' Roses guitarist Slash, who played guitar on Jackson's single [...] "Give In to Me" [...] stated: [...] "Really sad news about Michael. He was a talent from on high." [...] Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Audioslave performed a cover version of [...] "Billie Jean" [...] on June 27, 2009, at the Peace & Love festival in Borlänge, Sweden. Steve Vai and Andy Timmons of Danger Danger performed an instrumental version of [...] "Beat It" [...] at the Meinl Guitar Festival 2009 on June 27 in Gutenstetten, Germany. Former Skid Row frontman, Sebastian Bach commented: [...] "Another angel down... I am very sorry for my friend Jermaine's loss. I lived with Jermaine for three weeks last year (during the filming of the second season of CMT's hit series, 'Gone Country'), and we talked about his brother frequently. He said to me, 'When you cut up my brother, you're cutting up me'. I feel for the Jackson family, because I know all too well how they feel. Unfortunately." [...] Geoff Tate of Queensrÿche stated: [...] "I grew up listening to Michael Jackson, watching him and his brothers perform on television. He made performing seem easy and inspired my generation with his music and his grace. He was one of a kind and will be missed but his music will live forever." [...] Legendary Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen recorded [...] "Beat It" [...] with ex-Judas Priest/Iced Earth frontman Tim [...] "Ripper" [...] Owens on vocals. Guitarist Buckethead wrote a song entitled [...] "The Homing Beacon", inspired by Jackson's 3-D film, Captain EO.
