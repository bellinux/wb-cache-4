5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s blues music was largely known in Britain through blues-influenced boogie-woogie, and the jump blues of Fats Waller and Louis Jordan. Imported {{recordings}} of American artists were brought over by African American servicemen stationed in Britain {{during and after}} World War II, merchant seamen visiting the ports of London, Liverpool, Newcastle on Tyne and Belfast, and in a <b>trickle</b> <b>of</b> (illegal) imports. From 1955 major British record labels HMV and EMI (the latter, particularly through their subsidiary Decca Records), began to distribute American jazz and increasingly blues records to the emerging market.|$|E
5|$|On Malta, the {{dissolution}} of the Roman Catholic Church under French rule had been extremely unpopular among the native Maltese population. During an auction of church property on 2 September 1798, an armed uprising had begun that had forced the French garrison, commanded by General Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois, to retreat into the capital Valletta {{by the end of the}} month. The garrison, which numbered approximately 3,000 men, had limited food stocks, and efforts to bring supplies in by sea were restricted by a squadron of British and Portuguese ships stationed off the harbour. The blockade was under the command of Nelson, now Lord Nelson, based in Palermo on Sicily, and directly managed by Captain Alexander Ball on the ship of the line HMS Alexander. During 1799 a number of factors, including inadequate food production on Malta, lack of resources and troops caused by commitments elsewhere in the Mediterranean and the appearance of a French fleet under Admiral Etienne Eustache Bruix in the Western Mediterranean all contributed to lapses in the blockade. However, despite the <b>trickle</b> <b>of</b> supplies that reached the garrison, Vaubois' troops were beginning to suffer the effects of starvation and disease. Late in the year Ball went ashore assist the Maltese troops conducting the siege and was replaced in command of Alexander by his first lieutenant, William Harrington.|$|E

A Thai order was placed, but taken over by the British when the war started. Vickers built a total of 153 (the most common figure) Mark Es.|$|E

25|$|Mobile grew {{substantially}} {{in the period}} {{leading up to the}} Civil War, when the Confederates heavily fortified it. Union naval forces established a blockade under the command of Admiral David Farragut. The Confederates countered by constructing blockade-runners: fast, shallow-draft, low-slung ships that could either outrun or evade the blockaders, maintaining a <b>trickle</b> <b>of</b> trade in and out of Mobile. Also, the Hunley, the first submarine to sink an enemy vessel in combat, was built and tested in Mobile.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} hoopla {{over the}} domestic violence and civil killings provoked a massive police operation in the city with 2000 policemen surrounded the Pacco Qillo locality. The huge army of peacemakers could not curb the riots {{and had to be}} called back. There was only a <b>trickle</b> <b>of</b> internal migrations before the operation, but the operation triggered a mass exodus of population. The Muhajir migrated en masse from Qasimabad and the interior of Sindh into Latifabad. Similarly, the Sindhis people moved to Qasimabad from Hyderabad and Latifabad.|$|E
25|$|July {{continued}} the same pattern: {{a number of}} AA rounds expended most nights, more fired in support of ground operations around Caen, and a <b>trickle</b> <b>of</b> casualties from occasional shellfire and bombs. From 7 to 9 July, 324 Bty fired at enemy observation posts (OPs) and other targets in the Colombelles factory area while I Corps attacked Caen (Operation Charnwood). At the beginning of August, 103rd HAA Rgt was redeployed, with one 8-gun battery east of the Orne and the remainder concentrated round the canal bridges.|$|E

He was as feeble, spare, and slow in his pinches as in everything else, but a certain little <b>trickling</b> <b>of</b> enjoyment of them played in the poor worn nerves about the corners of his eyes and mouth.|$|R
25|$|The Ward Line, which {{operated}} {{a line between}} the United States and Cuba, also supplied a steady <b>trickle</b> <b>of</b> contracts. The Roach yard completed the 2,265-ton sister ships Niagara and Saratoga for the Ward Line in 1877. The following year, the yard completed the 2,426-ton Sarataga II for the same company, and in 1879 completed the 2,300-ton Santiago. Another passenger-freighter, the 2,300-ton Cienfuegos, was completed for the Ward Line in 1883. Roach owned shares {{in some of these}} vessels, and he eventually became a director on the company's board.|$|E
25|$|The fleet {{remained}} largely intact for around 15 years after production ended in 1968, with withdrawals mainly due to fires. Following {{the defeat of}} the Greater London Council in the House of Lords over its subsidised fare scheme, major service reductions followed in September 1982. Consequently, the first withdrawals commenced, with many of these early disposals being for scrap. The continued practice of route conversion to one-person operation resulted in a steady <b>trickle</b> <b>of</b> withdrawals. This practice had largely halted by 1988, with comparatively few withdrawn up to 1992.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the broken}} ground which slowed his progress, Arimondi {{completed}} his movement at 9:00 a.m. Almost immediately {{he came upon}} a <b>trickle</b> <b>of</b> wounded soldiers from Albertone's brigade, which {{had been forced to}} retreat on the nearby mount Semaiata. Within half an hour the trickle became a stream and Baratieri sent Albertone orders to retire and reform under Arimondi's cover. It was too late: the Colonial Brigade, out of ammunition, disintegrated shortly afterwards. At 10:00 a.m. the Ethiopian forces, mixed with the disbanded Italians, launched their first assault on Arimondi's position.|$|E

25|$|There {{was also}} a <b>trickle</b> <b>of</b> {{immigration}} from the neighbouring Portuguese islands, {{in the form of}} escaped slaves and prospective planters. Although a few of the Fernandinos were Catholic and Spanish-speaking, about nine-tenths of them were Protestant and English-speaking {{on the eve of the}} First World War, and pidgin English was the lingua franca of the island. The Sierra Leoneans were particularly well placed as planters while labor recruitment on the Windward coast continued, for they kept family and other connections there and could easily arrange labor supplies.|$|E

Incidentally, Polito also debunks the myth that Thompson was not paid well for his works: Thompson's pay, he notes, was roughly {{in line with what}} writers of similar works received during that era. Rather, Thompson's drinking and general instability are what left him destitute.|$|E
25|$|Among older authorities, Gardthausen and Thompson {{took the}} {{identity}} between san and sampi for granted.
