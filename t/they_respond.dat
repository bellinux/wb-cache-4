5|$|Banksia oblongifolia {{plants can}} live {{for more than}} 60 years. <b>They</b> <b>respond</b> to bushfire by resprouting from buds located on the large woody lignotuber. Larger lignotubers have the {{greatest}} number of buds, although buds are more densely spaced on smaller lignotubers. A 1988 field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found that shoots grow longer after fire, particularly one within the previous four years, and that new buds grow within six months after a fire. These shoots are able to grow, flower and set seed two to three years after a fire. The woody infructescences also release seeds as their follicles are opened with heat, although a proportion do open spontaneously at other times. One field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found 10% opened in the absence of bushfire, and that seeds germinated, and young plants do grow. Older plants are serotinous, that is, they store large numbers of seed in an aerial seed bank in their canopy that are released after fire. Being relatively heavy, the seeds do not disperse far from the parent plant.|$|E

5|$|Both sexes are {{involved}} in defending the territory. One aspect of territorial defense involves identifying {{the proximity of the}} threat based on the loudness of bird song as well as the level of degradation of the calls. In experiments involving playback, the wrens are capable of discriminating between degraded and undegraded songs, as well as degraded songs in the same acoustic conditions, and can detect changes of acoustic properties within their territories, such as songs under foliage. Song degradation {{can also be used to}} determine the proximity of potential intruders. If the song of a bird appears to be degraded, the wrens will assume that the threat is distant not respond; if the song is not degraded, <b>they</b> <b>respond</b> by attacking. Not all birds within their territory are potential enemies. Some species of birds that are neighbors are designated as 'dear-enemies' by the wrens, and the responses to neighbors and intruders in their territories differ by the season. In spring, the wrens respond more aggressively toward neighbors, though in the fall, no major discrepancy in responses is shown. When protecting their nest, alarm calls are the general response. The wrens judge the size of the potential threat, such as a blue jay and avoid the risk of injury when attacking. Countersinging produced by intruder birds is more likely to be taken as an aggressive threat to male Carolina wrens.|$|E

40|$|People dislike {{individuals}} {{who claim that}} they are better than others. In the present research we examined whether they {{do so because they}} dislike self-superiority claims in particular or because they dislike superiority claims or overt vertical social comparisons in general. In Study 1, participants read a self-description or an other-description that was a superiority claim or that was positive yet non-comparative in nature. Although <b>they</b> <b>responded</b> less favorably to both the self-superiority claim and the other-superiority claim than to the corresponding non-comparative description, <b>they</b> <b>responded</b> particularly unfavorably to the self-superiority claim. In Study 2, participants read a positive or negative self-description or other-description that was either comparative or non-comparative. <b>They</b> <b>responded</b> more unfavorably to the superiority claims than to the corresponding positive non-comparative person descriptions. Again, <b>they</b> <b>responded</b> more unfavorably to the self-superiority claim than to the other-superiority claim. However, <b>they</b> did not <b>respond</b> more unfavorably to the inferiority claims than to the negative non-comparative person descriptions. We conclude that people’s dislike for self-superiority claims is not due to a general dislike for overt vertical comparison and that it is only partly due to a general dislike for any superiority claim. The theoretical, practical and methodological implications for person perception, impression management, and the interpersonal consequences of self-superiority beliefs will be discussed. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|As {{a result}} of this Supermom ideal, {{cultural}} contradictions of motherhood widely exist.

Only the unrealistic depiction of the supermom can balance these two ideological extremes, but that ideal is an unrealistic solution for most women.|$|E
25|$|Caudal: The {{upper and}} lower jaws are covered with sensory pits, visible as small, black {{speckles}} on the skin, the crocodilian version of the lateral line organs seen in fish and many amphibians, though arising from a completely different origin.

25|$|The {{language}} of the birds {{has long been a}} topic for anecdote and speculation. That calls have meanings that are interpreted by their listeners has been well demonstrated. Domestic chickens have distinctive alarm calls for aerial and ground predators, and <b>they</b> <b>respond</b> to these alarm calls appropriately. However, a language has, in addition to words, grammar (that is, structures and rules). Studies to demonstrate the existence of language have been difficult due to the range of possible interpretations. Research on parrots by Irene Pepperberg is claimed to demonstrate the innate ability for grammatical structures, including the existence of concepts such as nouns, adjectives and verbs. Studies on starling vocalizations have also suggested that they may have recursive structures.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of firefighter: wholetime and retained. Wholetime firefighters work {{full-time}} in the fire service.

Large town fire stations have wholetime crews, while small rural ones are usually staffed only by retained firefighters. Voluntary firefighters are now rare: the only voluntary units now in operation are the Peterborough Volunteer Fire Brigade and the Borth Voluntary Fire Unit (near Aberystwyth, Wales).|$|E
