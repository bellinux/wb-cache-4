5|$|Up to {{the frontiers}} of the Roman Empire, silk became a {{monetary}} standard for estimating the value of different products. Hellenistic Greece appreciated the high quality of the Chinese goods and made efforts to plant mulberry trees and breed silkworms in the Mediterranean basin.

5|$|As {{the town}} became more prominent, it was {{repeatedly}} {{attacked by the}} Hanseatic League.

In 1254, it received a charter as a city under Bishop Jakob Erlandsen who garnered support from the local fishing merchants against the king by granting them special privileges. In the mid 1330s, the first land assessment of the city was published.|$|E

5|$|Consequently, {{the rise}} of slavery {{was due to the}} {{increasing}} rise of crops being produced and traded, more specifically {{the rise of}} the plantation economy The rise of the plantations was the main reason for <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> commodities during proto-globalization. Plantations were used by the exporting countries (mainly America) to grow the raw materials needed to manufacture the goods which were traded back into the plantation economy. Commodities that grew in trade due to the plantation economy were mainly tobacco, cotton, sugar cane, and rubber.|$|E
5|$|In 135 BC, Tang Meng led the {{earliest}} Han expedition against Dian, establishing the Jianwei commandery in southwestern China. The Dian tribes {{were involved in}} <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> livestock, horses, fruit, and slaves, and was attractive to the Han because of their resources and metalworking expertise. Trade routes between Dian {{and the rest of}} the Han empire were opened up by Han soldiers. The Han continued their expansion northward, and annexed the territory near Shu.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, Banagher was {{the centre}} of a flourishing woollen trade. In 1699, the impost placed on the export of woollen goods to England {{practically}} killed the woollen trade. At {{the outbreak of the}} American Revolutionary War in 1775, an embargo placed on the export of foodstuffs to the American Colonies dealt another blow to <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> Banagher. In 1780, the British Parliament withdrew all these restrictions and Banagher's economy began to improve rapidly.|$|E

40|$|By using signed {{small trade}} {{turnover}} (SSTT) {{as a proxy}} <b>of</b> investors’ systematic <b>trading</b> behaviour and permanent price effect (PPE) {{as a proxy for}} informed trading, this article investigates the short-term outperformance of high SSTT stocks for categories of investors on the NASDAQ OMX Helsinki (OMXH) and whether the outperformance is best understood in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> investor <b>trading</b> behaviour or informed trading. This study finds that <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>of</b> high SSTT stocks is associated with a lower PPE than <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>of</b> low SSTT stocks, which implies that <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>of</b> high SSTT stocks is less informed than <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>of</b> low SSTT stocks, and that the short-term outperformance of high SSTT stocks relative to low SSTT stocks is best explained within the behavioural finance framework, that is, by investors’ bias towards popular stocks proxied by SSTT, and not within the rational framework, that is, by informed <b>trading</b> proxied by <b>the</b> PPE. These findings are economically and statistically significant for all types of investors...|$|R

He established a duchy monopoly on <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> salt, leather, tobacco, and liquor and founded a bank and porcelain factory.

5|$|Manitoba's early economy {{depended}} on mobility and {{living off the}} land. Aboriginal Nations (Cree, Ojibwa, Dene, Sioux and Assiniboine) followed herds of bison and congregated to trade among themselves at key meeting places throughout the province. After {{the arrival of the}} first European traders in the 17th century, the economy centred on <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> beaver pelts and other furs. Diversification of the economy came when Lord Selkirk brought the first agricultural settlers in 1811, though the triumph of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) over its competitors ensured the primacy of the fur trade over widespread agricultural colonization.|$|E

For a time, Letcher attended the common schools of the area, but he was dismissed for being unruly.

5|$|Taiwanese Plains Aborigines {{were often}} {{employed}} and dispatched as interpreters {{to assist in}} <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> goods between Han merchants and Highlands aborigines. The aborigines traded cloth, pelts and meat for iron and matchlock rifles. Iron was a necessary material for the fabrication of hunting knives—long, curved sabers that were generally used as a forest tool. These blades became notorious among Han settlers, given their alternative use to decapitate Highland indigenous enemies in customary headhunting expeditions.|$|E
5|$|The Blue Jackets {{began the}} year with the worst start in {{franchise}} history and the worst by any team in an NHL season in 19 years. After an 11–25–5 start, Head Coach Scott Arniel was fired and replaced by Assistant Coach Todd Richards. The poor season prompted several personnel changes including <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> All-Star forward Jeff Carter, who was acquired with much fanfare during the off-season. With the prospect of another rebuild looming the Blue Jackets' captain and best player, Rick Nash, requested to be traded, though he would remain with the team for the entire season.|$|E
5|$|The European {{demand for}} {{agricultural}} products and industrial commodities stipulated maritime activity and international trade to an unprecedented extent. The Ayyubids {{played a leading role}} in this as they controlled sea-trade routes which passed through the ports of Yemen and Egypt via the Red Sea. The trade policy of the Ayyubids placed them in a position of great advantage; although they cooperated with the Genoans and Venetians in the Mediterranean Sea, they prevented them from having access to the Red Sea. Thus, they kept <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> the Indian Ocean exclusively in their hands. In the Mediterranean trade, the Ayyubids drew large benefits in the form of taxes and commissions which they learned from the Italians.|$|E

5|$|Tittle {{played for}} the 49ers until 1960, after which he {{was traded to the}} New York Giants, with whom he had the most {{successful}} years of his career; he was named AP NFL MVP in 1963, led the team to three straight NFL championship games, and broke several passing records. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> Tittle for guard Lou Cordileone is seen as one of the worst trades in 49ers franchise history. Tittle retired as the NFL's all-time leader in passing yards, passing touchdowns, completions, attempts, total offense, and games played. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971.|$|E
40|$|The {{value of}} {{specialist}} assistance to <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>of</b> low-volume stocks {{has important implications}} in exchange design.

These results are consistent with specialist subsidization of low-volume stocks in their portfolios and suggest that specialists provide important support to <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>of</b> inactive stocks if they have the resources.
