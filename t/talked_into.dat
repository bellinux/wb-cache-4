5|$|On {{the morning}} of the 9th, Crowe met with the {{committee}} and told them that management refused their demands, was stopping all work, and was laying off the entire work force, except for a few office workers and carpenters. The workers were given until 5p.m. to vacate the premises. Concerned that a violent confrontation was imminent, most workers took their paychecks and left for Las Vegas to await developments. Two days later, the remainder were <b>talked</b> <b>into</b> leaving by law enforcement. On August 13, the company began hiring workers again, and two days later, the strike was called off. While the workers received none of their demands, the company guaranteed there would be no further reductions in wages. Living conditions began to improve as the first residents moved into Boulder City in late 1931.|$|E
5|$|According to a podcast {{interview}} with Chris Jericho, Copeland {{said that he}} did not initially like the idea of the ladder match and even told WWE management not to include him on the Wrestlemania 21 card altogether. However, he was <b>talked</b> <b>into</b> competing by the other participants like Jericho and Glenn Jacobs (Kane) who said the match had {{the potential to be a}} big success. At Backlash, Edge defeated Chris Benoit in a Last Man Standing match to end the feud. Several weeks after, Edge was then paired with Lita, his real-life girlfriend at the time, in an angle in which she betrayed her storyline husband Kane, by costing him a number-one contender match for the World Heavyweight Championship. Edge faced even more scorn from fans due to this relationship, which lasted over a year. The next week, Edge received his World Heavyweight Championship match against Batista, which he lost. Edge started a feud with Kane leading to several matches between them including one at Vengeance, when Edge lost to Kane. After trading several victories on Raw, the feud ended in a stretcher match on the July 25 episode of Raw that Edge won, but shortly after, Kane performed a tombstone piledriver on Lita.|$|E
5|$|He {{was sent}} to Belgian Second Division side Royal Antwerp on a loan spell. He {{got off to a}} bad start at the club and asked to return to Old Trafford after being abused by Antwerp {{supporters}} outside the Bosuilstadion, and had to be <b>talked</b> <b>into</b> staying by manager Regi Van Acker. Following this start the club then won 15 matches in a row and Higginbotham become popular with the fans. However, the season ended with defeat in a play-off game, and after the final whistle there was an alleged attack on referee Amand Ancion by teammate Ronnie Wallwork. Higginbotham was subsequently banned from football for a year for his involvement. In September 1999, a Belgian court reduced Higginbotham's ban to four months. Ancion maintained that Wallwork had grabbed him by the throat and that Higginbotham had headbutted him. Higginbotham always maintained his innocence, stating that he had tried to intervene peacefully after Wallwork had confronted Ancion in an aggressive manner. Alex Ferguson believed the player's innocence and handed both players four-year contracts as the club appealed their suspensions.|$|E

25|$|In 1985/86 {{the club}} lost their {{equivalent}} of Chappell, Lillee and Marsh, with Salter, Lloyd and Kline all departing the club. Despite record playing numbers, peaking with 15 teams in 1986/87, {{and the introduction}} of the veterans XI in 1988/89, the next few seasons saw the 1st XI languish in {{the bottom half of the}} ladder, but remained in Chandler Shield. Following a year where the highest ranked senior side was the 8th placed reserve side, John Sharman was recruited to the club as captain/coach in 1990/91. His work ethic on the training field rubbed off on the field, as the top 3 teams all made finals. Sharman also brought with him an array of talent, including determined opening batsman Andrew Hood, Campbell Horlock and all-rounder Harry Drysdale. And with the emergence of Warrandyte juniors Tony Sturesteps, Gerald Walshe and David Mooney, the 1st XI were becoming competitive again, returning to the finals in 1992/93. They lost the semi final to Ainslie Park, which would start one of the great RDCA rivalries. The next season, local fruit shop owner and former Australian test cricket Rodney Hogg was <b>talked</b> <b>into</b> rolling the arm over again. Despite being 42 years old at the time, was still extremely quick when in the mood, and terrorised many a batsmen in his 2 seasons at Warrandyte.|$|E

The victim is <b>talked</b> <b>into</b> exchanging bank account information on the premise that the money will be transferred to him, and then he'll get to keep a cut.
