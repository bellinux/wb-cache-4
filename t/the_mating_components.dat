50|$|In {{most modern}} Electric Power Steering (EPS) systems, the motor housing {{is a part}} of the rack casting which is usually made from {{lightweight}} materials, such as aluminum alloys. The stators are traditionally press fitted into the housing. Tolerance rings can be used instead of press fitting. With their wavelike protrusions, tolerance rings generate a retention force when compressed between the housing and the stator. These protrusions act as springs and allow <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> <b>components</b> to expand and contract at different rates while still providing the required retention force.|$|E
50|$|Pipe dope is any thread lubricant, {{thread sealing}} compound, and {{anaerobic}} chemical sealants {{that are used}} to make a pipe thread joint leak proof and pressure tight. Although common pipe threads are tapered and therefore will achieve an interference fit during proper assembly, machining and finishing variances usually result in a fit that does not result in 100 percent contact between <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> <b>components.</b> The application of pipe dope prior to assembly will fill the minute voids between the threads, thus making the joint pressure tight. Pipe dope also acts as a lubricant and helps prevent seizing of the mating parts, which can later cause difficulty during disassembly.|$|E
40|$|Designing {{the handle}} bar {{assembly}} of a two wheeler holds many challenges together with valuation {{of the structural}} strength of <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> <b>components.</b> While the handle bar is subjected to buckling, the housing and the other frame experiences tensile, compressive and shear stress. The situations during braking and the forces generated due to road bumps and pot holes can increases the problem. This work shall focus on conducting linear stress analysis while evaluating and rationalizing the loads. Finite element analysis of handle bar assembly is carried out using Altair solver code RADIOSS. In this study the handle bar assembly is excited with acceleration obtained from road load data to evaluate the strength of mountings on handle-bar. Model is prepared using Catia V 5 R 20, Pre processer Hyper Mesh and Post processing is done using Hyper View. The Finite element analysis outcomes are also well allied by the experimental results in which failure site and pattern is accurately matched.

50|$|Tolerance Rings are {{radially}} sprung rings {{that are}} press fitted between two <b>mating</b> <b>components</b> {{to act as}} frictional fasteners. They are flexible shims designed to fix two cylindrical parts together. The wavelike protrusions that run around the circumference of the ring generate a retention force to provide an optimal fit between <b>the</b> two <b>mating</b> <b>components</b> without <b>the</b> need for adhesive or excessive assembly force, simplifying the process for manufacturers. They allow for any misalignment caused by thermal expansion or excessive vibration. Tolerance rings {{can be used as}} bearing mounts and as a means of dealing with torque transfer, torque overload protection and axial slip between <b>mating</b> <b>components.</b> They are often used to isolate undesirable vibration in engines and electric motors, for noise-free mechanism operation in passenger vehicles and domestic appliances, where noise reduction has become a major trend in recent years. Modifications to tolerance rings can be made to tune the dynamic stiffness and, therefore, the frequencies that can be isolated.|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{inherent}} tolerance variability of hardware, flange misalignments occur during installation of <b>mating</b> <b>components</b> for a liquid propellant rocket engine. Flange misalignments include axial, lateral, and angular offsets. If these misalignments are high, they can impart significant loads into <b>the</b> two <b>mating</b> <b>components.</b> These significant loads {{can then be}} a driver {{in the design of}} the propellant ducts. Such was the case for the Rocketdyne RS- 83 engine design for the Space Launch Initiative Program. To address this flange misalignment issue, Marshall Space Flight Center joined with Rocketdyne to develop and test a spherical flange system that allows for misalignment, yet reduces loads imparted, and at the same time provides sufficient sealing against leakage. The flange design was tested to evaluate and compare performance parameters such as misalignment and leakage. The environmental conditions ranged from - 100 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (F) with 1000 to 4000 pounds per square inch gage (psig) pressure. The desirable design features will be extracted and synthesized into a new flange design concept. This paper will address the spherical flange design and the test results...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCoffee is a {{very common}} {{beverage}} exported all over the world: just after roasting, coffee beans are packed in plastic or paper bags, which then experience long transfers with long storage times. Fresh roasted coffee emits large amounts of CO 2 for several weeks. This gas must be gradually released, to prevent package over-inflation and to preserve aroma, moreover beans must be protected from oxygen coming from outside. Therefore, one-way degassing valves are applied to each package: their correct functionality is strictly related to the interference coupling between their bodies and covers and to the correct assembly of the other involved parts. This work takes inspiration from an industrial problem: a company that assembles valve components, supplied by different manufacturers, observed {{a high level of}} defect rate, affecting its valve production. An integrated approach, consisting in the adoption of quality charts, in an experimental campaign for the dimensional analysis of the mating parts and in the statistical processing of the data, was necessary to tackle the question. In particular, a simple statistical tool was made available to predict the defect rate and to individuate the best strategy for its reduction. The outcome was that requiring a strict protocol, regarding the combinations of parts from different manufacturers for assembly, would have been almost ineffective. Conversely, this study led to the individuation of the weak point in the manufacturing process of <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> <b>components</b> and to the suggestion of a slight improvement to be performed, with the final result of a significant (one order of magnitude) decrease of the defect rate...|$|E
40|$|The {{pressurization}} and propellant feed {{lines for}} the Ares 1 Upper Stage Reaction and Roll Control Systems (ReCS and RoCS) {{were required to}} be in a high g-load random vibration flight environment. The lines connected the system components and were filled with both liquid hydrazine and gaseous helium. They are considered small and varied between one fourth to one inch in diameter. The random vibration of the lines was considered to be base excitation through <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> <b>components</b> and mounting hardware. It was found that reducing the amount of support structure for the lines added flexibility to the system and improved the line stresses from random vibration, but caused higher stresses from the static g-loads. The locations and number of brackets were optimized by analyzing the mode shapes of the lines causing high stresses. The use of brackets that only constrain motion in the direction of concern further reduced the stresses in the lines. Finite element analysis was used to perform the analysis. The lines were pre-stressed by temperature and internal pressure with fluid and insulation included as non-structural mass. Base excitation was added to the model using Power Spectral Density (PSD) data for the expected flight loads. The random vibration and static g-load cases were combined to obtain the total stress in the lines. This approach advances {{the state of the art}} in line analysis by using FEA to predict the stresses in the lines and to optimize the entire system based on the expected flight environment. Adding flexibility to lines has been used in piping system for temperature loads, but in flight environments flexibility has been limited for the static stresses. Adding flexibility to the system in a flight environment by reducing brackets has the benefit of reducing stresses and weigh...|$|E

Literature data about contemporary populations have already demonstrated the influence of somatic traits in <b>the</b> <b>mate</b> choice. <b>The</b> results presented here show that men with low height and poor health status at the age of 20 were negatively selected for marriage. This holds true also in a society where families often arranged marriages for their children. This pattern of male selection on marriage was found to be particularly marked among the richest and wealthiest SES groups. Our hypothesis is that this social group carefully selected for marriage those individuals who were apparently healthier and therefore more likely to guarantee good health status and better life conditions to offspring. In evolutionary terms, <b>the</b> <b>mate</b> choice <b>component</b> of sexual selection suggests that the height of prospective partners could be claimed as one of the determinants, along with other environmental causes, of the observed higher stature of men belonging to the wealthiest social strata of the Alghero population...|$|R

A thorough understanding of hardware throughout the fabrication cycle and hotfire testing is critical to meet component design intent. Regeneratively cooled nozzles and associated tooling require tight control of tolerances during the fabrication process to ensure optimal performance.

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} an installation and assembly device and method for facilitating <b>the</b> fitup of <b>mating</b> <b>components</b> during blind or remote installation and assembly, especially where close fitup tolerances are involved. The present invention is particularly {{useful for the}} purpose of facilitating vertical and/or radial relative positioning of a pump impeller within a mating inlet nozzle during a blind assembly wherein actual fitup cannot be observed during installation. The information within identifies just one successful application of the installation and assembly alignment device for a pump. The device, however, is not solely limited to pump assembly but can be used in other cases where fitup of a sleeve inside a mating bore is required under conditions of close tolerance during a blind or remote assembly. The device is likewise not limited to circular configurations but can be used for many other shapes or configurations. Any material that can be machined and hold reasonably close tolerances can be used for the device. Also, because the sleeve position is adjusted by set screws or bolts, the concentricity can be radially biased, if required, to achieve particular alignment conditions...|$|R

40|$|Geometric feature {{variations}} are {{the result}} of variations in the shape, orientation or location of part features as defined in ANSI Y 14. 5 M- 1982 tolerance standard [ANSI 1982]. When such feature variations occur on <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> surfaces between <b>components</b> of an assembly, they affect the variation of the completed assembly. The geometric feature variations accumulate statistically and propagate kinematically in a similar manner to the dimensional variations of the components in the assembly. The Direct Linearization Method (DLM) for assembly tolerance analysis provides a method for estimating variations and assembly rejects, caused by the dimensional variations of the components in an assembly. So far, no generalized approach has been developed to include all geometric feature variations in a computer-aided tolerance analysis system. This paper introduces a new, generalized approach for including all the geometric feature variations in the tolerance analysis of mechanical assemblies. It focuses on how to characterize geometric feature variations in vector-loop-based assembly tolerance models. The characterization will be used to help combine the effects of all variations within an assembly in order to predict assembly rejects using the DLM. 1...|$|R

40|$|Background: One {{aspect of}} premating {{isolation}} between diverging, locally-adapted population pairs is female mate choice for resident over alien male phenotypes. Mating preferences often show considerable individual variation, {{and whether or}} not certain individuals are more likely to contribute to population interbreeding remains to be studied. In the Poecilia mexicana-species complex different ecotypes have adapted to hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) -toxic springs, and females from adjacent non-sulfidic habitats prefer resident over sulfide-adapted males. We asked if consistent individual differences in behavioral tendencies (animal personality) predict the strength and direction of <b>the</b> <b>mate</b> choice <b>component</b> of premating isolation in this system. Results: We characterized focal females for their personality and found behavioral measures of ‘novel object exploration’, ‘boldness’ and ‘activity in an unknown area’ to be highly repeatable. Furthermore, the interaction term between our measures of exploration and boldness affected focal females’ strength of preference (SOP) for the resident male phenotype in dichotomous association preference tests. High exploration tendencies were coupled with stronger SOPs for resident over alien mating partners in bold, but not shy, females. Shy and/or little explorative females had an increased likelihood of preferring the non-resident phenotype and thus, are more likely to contribute to rare population hybridization. When we offered large vs. small conspecific stimulus males instead, less explorative females showed stronger preferences for large male body size. However, this effect disappeared when the size difference between the stimulus males was small. Conclusions: Our results suggest that personality affects female mate choice in a very nuanced fashion. Hence, population differences in the distribution of personality types could be facilitating or impeding reproductive isolation between diverging populations depending on the study system and the male trait(s) upon which females base their mating decisions, respectively...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a low-cost, centimeter-scale kinematic coupling fixture {{for use in}} nanomanufacturing equipment. The fixture uses magnetic circuit design techniques to optimize the magnetic preload required to achieve repeatability {{on the order of}} 100 nanometers. The fixture achieves accuracy to within one micrometer via an adjustable interface composed of UV curing adhesive between <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> kinematic coupling <b>components.</b> <b>The</b> fixture is monitored by a micro-vision system and moved by a six-axis nanopositioner until proper alignment is achieved, at which point the fixture position is permanently set by UV light. This thesis presents design rules and insights for design of a general accurate and repeatable kinematic fixture and presents a case study of fixtures used for tool exchange on dip pen nanolithography machines. A prototype fixturing assembly was fabricated and tested for repeatability and stability in six degrees of freedom. The test results concluded that the fixture has a 1 -o- 3 -D translational repeatability of 87 nanometers and a 3 -D stability of 344 nanometers over 48 hours. This is an order of magnitude improvement on past low-cost accurate and repeatable fixture designs. This optimized accurate and repeatable kinematic fixture will enable repeatable, accurate, quick, and elegant tool change, thus advancing the manufacturing capabilities of nanofabrication techniques. by Adrienne Watral.

Control of this insect pest may be achieved by interfering with olfactory pathways to block detection of female-produced sex pheromones and consequently, disrupt <b>mating.</b> <b>The</b> first <b>component</b> of this pathway is the pheromone-binding protein AtraPBP 1, which recognizes the pheromone and presents it to the odorant receptor housed in a sensory neuron of the male antennae.

To characterize this conformational change and to understand how pheromones bind, we have determined the high resolution crystal structures of AtraPBP 1 in complex with two main constituents of the sex pheromone, i. e., (11 Z, 13 Z) -hexadecadienal and (11 Z, 13 Z) -hexadecadienol. Comparison with the structure of the unliganded form demonstrates a large ∼ 90 ° movement of the C-terminal helix which is observed in other pheromone- or odorant-binding proteins accompanied by an unpredicted 37 ° displacement of the N-terminal helix.
