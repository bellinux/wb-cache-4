50|$|<b>Tapered</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> use conical <b>rollers</b> {{that run}} on conical races. Most <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> only take radial or axial loads, but <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> support both radial and axial loads, and {{generally}} can carry higher loads than ball bearings due to greater contact area. <b>Tapered</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are used, for example, as the wheel bearings of most wheeled land vehicles. The downsides to this bearing is that due to manufacturing complexities, <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are usually more expensive than ball bearings; and additionally under heavy loads the <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> is like a wedge and bearing loads tend to try to eject the roller; the force from the collar which keeps the <b>roller</b> in the <b>bearing</b> adds to bearing friction compared to ball bearings.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} experiments per-formed towards diagnosis of localized defects in <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> using High Frequency Resonance Technique (HFRT). A special {{feature of the}} work is that instead of using analog filter and envelope detector for HFRT, digital filtering and envelope detection were used. To practically test this technique, an experimental setup was designed and fabricated for testing various <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> to obtain their vibration characteristics. For the purpose of testing, a few defect-free and defective <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> were tested using the fabricated set up-the defective bearings tested included bearings with outer race defects, roller defects and combination of both. Based on the above experiments {{it has been shown that}} HFRT is an objective technique and thus useful to diagnose point defects in <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings.</b> In addition, due its digital implementation, the HFRT demonstrated in this paper is cheaper than its analog counterpart...|$|R

40|$|A {{diagnostic}} tool {{was developed for}} detecting fatigue damage of <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings.</b> <b>Tapered</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are used in helicopter transmissions and have potential for use in high bypass advanced gas turbine aircraft engines. A {{diagnostic tool}} was developed and evaluated experimentally by collecting oil debris data from failure progression tests conducted using health monitoring hardware. Failure progression tests were performed with <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> under simulated engine load conditions. Tests were performed on one healthy bearing and three pre-damaged bearings. During each test, data from an on-line, in-line, inductance type oil debris sensor and three accelerometers were monitored and recorded for the occurrence of bearing failure. The bearing was removed and inspected periodically for damage progression throughout testing. Using data fusion techniques, two different monitoring technologies, oil debris analysis and vibration, were integrated into a health monitoring system for detecting bearing surface fatigue pitting damage. The data fusion diagnostic tool was evaluated during bearing failure progression tests under simulated engine load conditions. This integrated system showed improved detection of fatigue damage and health assessment of the <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> as compared to using individual health monitoring technologies...|$|R

50|$|Spherical roller {{bearings}} have an outer ring with an internal spherical shape. The rollers are thicker {{in the middle}} and thinner at the ends. Spherical {{roller bearings}} can thus accommodate both static and dynamic misalignment. However, spherical rollers are difficult to produce and thus expensive, and the bearings have higher friction than an ideal cylindrical or <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> since there will be a certain amount of sliding between rolling elements and rings.|$|E
50|$|Tapered roller {{bearings}} were a breakthrough {{at the end}} of the 19th century because bearings used in wheel axles had not changed much since ancient times. They consisted of a cylindrical seat on the frame and part of the axle enclosed in a case or box that held a lubricant. These were called journal bearings and relied on the lubricant to form a fluid bearing. Without adequate lubrication, journal bearings would fail due to the excessive heat caused by friction. Timken was able to significantly reduce the friction on his axle bearings by adding tapered elements which actually rolled while transferring the load evenly from axle to frame through the hardened steel inner and outer rings and the rollers - his <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing.</b>|$|E
