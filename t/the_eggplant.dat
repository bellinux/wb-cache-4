The soil showed a silty clay loam texture, initial pH value of 4. 1, pyrite content of 55 g kg- 1, base saturation of 47 %, ECe value of 3. 6 dS m- 1, high exchangeable Fe 3 + and Al 3 + contents of 1. 47 and 5. 29 cmolc kg- 1, respectively. The pH value of the average soil data obtained from all the treatments during fruit set (95 days after transplantation) of eggplants was found to be increased in pH by 1. 2 units higher compared with the control (i. e. initial pH value). The contents of P, K, Ca and Mg in the average soil data during fruit set were found to be increased (IOC = increased over control) by 41 to 127 % IOC, while the contents of Al 3 +, Fe 3 +, Na+, Cl- and SO 4 2 - in the soil were found to be decreased by 28 to 92 % IOC. The different treatments on <b>eggplants</b> grown under <b>the</b> modified-plain-ridge-ditch techniques in the Cheringa acid sulfate soil significantly (0 ≤ 0. 05) increased the fresh yield of <b>eggplants,</b> and <b>the</b> increment was more pronounced with Tech 2. The maximum yield of 17. 8 t ha- 1 of eggplant for Tech 1 and 20. 1 t ha- 1 for Tech 2 were recorded by the {{application of}} BS 30 in the soils of smaller aggregates (A 20) at the ridges of Tech 2, followed by the A 30 BS 30 treatments in both the techniques. The lowest quantity of 1. 7 t ha- 1 yield was recorded by the control treatment. <b>The</b> <b>eggplants</b> grown in <b>the</b> ridges of both the techniques exhibited the best responses on N, P, K, Ca and Mg contents in eggplant tissues during fruit set. As expected, the lowest contents of these nutrients in <b>the</b> <b>eggplants</b> were recorded in the control treatment. Sulfur content of <b>the</b> <b>eggplants</b> grown in <b>the</b> control plots was 3. 6 g kg- 1 and was in the range of adequate S content (4 g kg- 1). However, the S contents in <b>the</b> <b>eggplants</b> grown in different treatments were significantly (p≤ 0. 01) lower compared with the adequate level. The effectiveness of the treatments for the reclamation of the soil in relation to <b>the</b> growth of <b>eggplants</b> was: Tech 2 > Tech 1, BS 30 > BS 20, and A 20 > A 30. The results suggest that the physicochemical properties of the soil, and the growth, yield and nutrition of eggplants were strikingly improved by the application of flash leaching followed by BS 30 and A 20 treatments in the ridges of Tech 2, and are regarded as the best reclamation measures for this acid sulfate soil...|$|R
