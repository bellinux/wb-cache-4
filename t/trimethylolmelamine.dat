40|$|Abstract [...] Bending {{strength}} and creep behavior under fire of solid wood, {{laminated veneer lumber}} (LVL) and glued-laminated timber of albizzia (Albizzia falcata Backer) coated with fire retardant and hot pressed (surface densified) at several temperatures were evaluated. Chemical used was <b>trimethylolmelamine</b> mixed with phosphoric acid. coated {{at the amount of}} 100 g/m 2 • Results showed that the fire endurance (time to creep rupture) of surface densified albizzia treated with the chemicals was improved, compared to that of untreated ones. Temperature of hot pressing of 160 °C resulted in the longest time to creep rupture. Bending strength of woods was not affected when pressed at the temperature below 200 °C...|$|E
40|$|Carbons {{containing}} nitrogen (C-N composites) {{were derived}} from three commercial organic compounds, poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), polyacrylamide (PAA), and <b>trimethylolmelamine</b> (TMM) using the MgO template method. The C-N composites formed in nitrogen at 700 - 1000 ℃ had nitrogen content, W_[N], of 3 - 23 mass% and the specific surface area by N 2 adsorption, S_[BET], of 60 - 2000 m 2 g^[- 1] without activation. Generally high nitrogen content of the starting compound led to larger W_[N], but W_[N] was not proportional to the N/C mole ratio in the compounds. The value of S_[BET] strongly depended on the compound: S_[BET] (PVP) > S_[BET] (PAA) >> S_[BET] (TMM). There was a tendency for W_[N] to decrease with increasing S_[BET]. The capacitance measured in 1 mol dm^[- 3] H 2 SO 4 by cyclic voltammetry, C_[M] in F g^[- 1], suggested that both W_[N] and S_[BET] are influential in gaining large C_[M]. For the composites with W_[N] > 5 mass%, the capacitance normalized by S_[BET], C_[A] = C_[M]/S_[BET], was 0. 17 - 0. 65 F m^[- 2], which was larger than the electric double layer capacitance (0. 05 - 0. 15 F m^[- 2]), indicating that the pseudo-capacitance contributes significantly to C_[M]. The value of C_[A] increased with increasing W_[N], but a correlation between C_[A] and particular nitrogen species on the surface measured by XPS was obscure. It was suggested that the large C_[A] is not simply explained by redox reactions of the surface functional groups. The composite derived from PAA at 900 ℃ showed 234 F g^[- 1] at 2 mV s^[- 1] and 181 F g^[- 1] at 100 mV s^[- 1] with acceptable yield of the composite...|$|E
