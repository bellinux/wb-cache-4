Hunter Amphitheater Description== The amphitheater has architecturally exposed <b>steel</b> <b>trusses</b> and <b>frames</b> {{supporting}} curved <b>steel</b> roof purlins {{with a heavy}} timber, tongue-and-groove roof deck. The <b>steel</b> <b>trusses</b> and <b>frames</b> {{are designed}} and shaped to resemble the fronds of a palm tree. The steel structure is supported on concrete piers that are supported on a large concrete pile cap that rests on auger-cast-in-place piles. The concrete piers also support the main stage floor. The stage floor is a flat plate, 8 in thick post-tensioned concrete slab.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to develop a sizing {{optimization}} method for a <b>trussed</b> <b>steel</b> portal <b>frame</b> that meets strength and stability criteria presented in Eurocode 3. In addition to strength and stability of the frame members, the strength and geometrical restrictions of welded truss joints were also taken into account. The method was required to find a feasible solution of good quality within appropriate calculation time. Optimization and the finite element model of the frame were both implemented in MATLAB. A four-stage optimization procedure was developed. This procedure includes two subproblems which are both solved first with continuous variables and then with discrete variables. The cross-sectional dimensions of square hollow section profiles were treated as design variables of the optimization problem. An interior-point algorithm was used to solve the continuous problem. The discrete problem was solved by Genetic Algorithm. The method was tested with different structural setups in which the loading conditions and the geometry of the frame were changed. Both minimum-mass and minimum-cost solutions were searched. The distribution of total mass and cost was studied by the structural components. Additionally, the conflict of mass and cost was studied. High-strength steels were also considered in the study. Based on the results of optimization it was concluded that the four-stage procedure seems to be well-suited for the optimization problem of a <b>trussed</b> <b>steel</b> portal <b>frame...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{recent years}} the number of medium rise {{buildings}} is slowly increasing in North Cyprus. As a result, the need to use new construction materials and technologies is becoming more essential. Using hot rolled steel and cold rolled galvanized light gauge <b>steel</b> for building <b>frames</b> {{are two of the}} possible alternatives to reinforced concrete building frames currently used in the market. The number of <b>steel</b> <b>framed</b> buildings so far is less than five percent of all the buildings. Steel is an imported material. It is mainly used for the industrial buildings, either as truss roof system and/or complete portal <b>frame</b> and/or <b>truss</b> roof <b>steel</b> <b>framed</b> single storey structures. The engineers are not knowledgeable enough, the lack of training, inadequate fabrication facilities and many years of having used to reinforced concrete framed structures are the main reasons for engineers not using enough <b>steel</b> <b>framed</b> structures. The first part of this paper investigates the problems and possible solution of steel usage for structures in North Cyprus by analysing the number of buildings constructed after the year 2000. The second part summarizes the problems relating to the local reinforced concrete framed building construction, including inadequacies of repair, quality control, material quality and isolation of buildings from the external effects. Sustainability, stability and repair aspects for steel structures in comparison to reinforced concrete structures in North Cyprus are also briefly discussed in this paper...|$|R

The methods {{are based on the}} analysis of facade rigger braced structures where horizontal <b>steel</b> <b>trusses</b> (web riggers), located in the two end facades (web frames), are positioned in a direction parallel to the lateral loading on the building. Perpendicular to the horizontal load additional horizontal <b>steel</b> <b>trusses</b> in the wind and lee sides of the building, 2 ̆ 2 flange trusses 2 ̆ 2, complete the belt bracing structure. The method is focused on the contribution of the flange trusses to the lateral stiffness of the structure. The shear-lag due to differential strain in the flange frame columns along the wind and leeward facades is caused by bending and racking shear deformations in the flange trusses and is taken into account. In an approximate method the flange columns are replaced by a continuous medium of equivalent axial stiffness, i. e. a beam on an elastic foundation. The proposed {{methods of analysis}}, for use in the initial stages of the structural design of proposed tall buildings, offer simple and rapid means of establishing the influence of belt structures on horizontal deformations of the high-rise structure and internal forces...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} a technique for producing economical solutions for conventional structural <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> using topology optimization on the lateral bracing scheme. The study focuses mainly on minimizing {{the amount of}} material used and optimizing the placement of bracing elements in typical <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> structures to achieve economical and realistic solutions. Linear structural analysis is performed on <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> structures while considering static gravity and wind loading. The optimization scheme uses a "multi-level design" approach with two distinct optimization loops. The optimal beam and column sizes in a structural <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> system are generated in the first optimization loop and a bracing removal criterion is derived in the second loop to optimize the lateral bracing topology. A space constraint is imposed on the <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> structure to enable designers to specify large empty spaces. A performance index is proposed to compare the cost between structural <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> designed using conventional approaches, which rely on engineering experience and trial-and-error, and the approach specified in this study, which uses a multi-step optimization scheme. Two case studies are made, comparing <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> structures designed using the proposed method with one designed using the traditional method.

40|$|Abstract. To {{study the}} effect of damping on seismic {{performance}} of <b>steel</b> <b>frame,</b> using the pseudo dynamic test by inputting damping and no damping to analyze the seismic performance of semi-rigid <b>steel</b> <b>frame.</b> Analysis was focused on {{the effect of}} damping on the panel zone strain, story drift and interlayer force. The conclusion was that under the more severe earthquake, the structural damping had effects on the seismic performance of semi-rigid <b>steel</b> <b>frame.</b> Intruduction Damping was a kind of features during free vibration which was due to external influence or structural effect that decreased amplitude of structure {{and was one of the}} important characteristics that formed the seismic performance of structure. In the process of the amplitude decreasing, vibration system dissipated energy through different mechanisms of action. When researchers analyzed the seismic performance of <b>steel</b> <b>frame,</b> they often idealized the damping through setting linear viscous dampers or shock absorber in the <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> that could’t reflect the real implication of the damping to the structure.
