Dark Heart fires lightning bolts before the team, and captures many of them with his magic bag <b>the</b> <b>favor</b> he wanted Christy to do all along. The few Family members at hand determine that she {{has teamed up with}} him. This prompts Tenderheart Bear to hold a conference at the Hall of Hearts; Friend Bear, Secret Bear and Christy's friends later join them.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius the Elder is next {{mentioned}} in 608 as Patrician and Exarch of Africa. According to Patriarch Nikephoros, Heraclius the Elder {{had been appointed}} to the position by Maurice prior to the latter's deposition and death in 602. He might have replaced Innocentius, a temporary exarch appointed between 598 and 600. The appointment suggests that Heraclius the Elder enjoyed <b>the</b> <b>favor</b> of Maurice and would have reason to remain loyal to him. Heraclius the Elder and his African court notably lamented the death and execution of Maurice and posthumously praised the fallen emperor.|$|E

60|$|As soon as {{the secret}} of the {{defection}} of <b>the</b> <b>favored</b> unions leaked out, there were rumblings and mutterings in the labor world. Next, <b>the</b> <b>favored</b> unions withdrew from the international organizations and broke off all affiliations. Then came trouble and violence. The members of <b>the</b> <b>favored</b> unions were branded as traitors, and in saloons and brothels, on the streets and at work, and, in fact, everywhere, they were assaulted by the comrades they had so treacherously deserted.|$|R

Also, a different patient could become equally sick in <b>the</b> future. <b>Favoring</b> <b>the</b> youngest saves the most years of life, but a twenty-year-old has a more developed personality than an infant.|$|R
5|$|Maximus' {{refusal to}} accept Monothelitism {{caused him to}} be brought to the {{imperial}} capital of Constantinople to be tried as a heretic in 658. In Constantinople, Monothelitism had gained <b>the</b> <b>favor</b> of both the Emperor and the Patriarch of Constantinople. Maximus stood behind the Dyothelite position and was sent back into exile for four more years. During his trial he was accused of aiding the Muslim conquests in Egypt and North Africa, which he rejected as slander.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Major Margaret Houlihan (Loretta Swit) and Major Frank Burns (Larry Linville) are eagerly {{awaiting}} the upcoming transfer of {{command of the}} 4077th MASH: upon Blake's departure, Burns will become the unit commander. Henry and Radar begin {{to clean out the}} main office, sharing a sentimental moment in which Radar tells Blake of his meaning to him. As a token of appreciation and admiration, Radar gives him an inscribed Winchester cartridge; a surprised Henry returns <b>the</b> <b>favor</b> by spontaneously giving Radar a rectal thermometer that once belonged to his father.|$|E
5|$|Millennium Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) meets {{several other}} Group members {{to discuss the}} {{competing}} factions within the Group—the Roosters believe that the coming millennium will trigger a theological apocalypse, while the Owls believe {{the end of the}} world will be a secular, material disaster. The discovery and theft of the True Cross threatens to tip the internecine conflict in <b>the</b> <b>favor</b> of the Owls, leaving them in control of the Group; the assembled members are Roosters and wish to stop this.|$|E

5|$|The Court of Claims {{looked at}} whether the tribe had {{hunting and fishing}} rights and drew the same {{conclusion}} as the Wisconsin Supreme Court—that {{the terms of the}} treaty had to be resolved in <b>the</b> <b>favor</b> of the tribe, citing The Menominee Tribe of Indians v. United States, 95 Ct.Cl. 232 (Ct.Cl., 1941). In that decision, the Court of Claims had observed that the reason the tribe had agreed {{to the site of the}} reservation was that it was well suited for hunting, with plenty of game. The hunting rights by treaty were therefore confirmed.|$|E
5|$|The last Ayyubid {{ruler of}} Hama died in 1299 and Hama briefly passed through direct Mamluk suzerainty. However, in 1310, under the {{patronage}} of the Mamluk sultan al-Nasir Muhammad, Hama was {{restored to the}} Ayyubids under the well-known geographer and author Abu al-Fida. The latter died in 1331 and was succeeded by his son al-Afdal Muhammad, who eventually lost <b>the</b> <b>favor</b> of his Mamluk overlords. He was removed from his post in 1341 and Hama was formally placed under Mamluk rule.|$|E

He traveled to Turin to inspect a collection of Egyptian materials assembled by Bernardino Drovetti, which King Charles X had purchased, cataloguing it. In Turin and Rome, he realized the necessity of seeing Egyptian monuments first hand began to make plans for an expedition to Egypt collaborating with Tuscan scholars and the Archduke Leopold. In 1824, he became a correspondent of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the schools}} {{do not share}} {{geographic}} proximity, which would induce frequent recruiting battles, {{there have been some}} high-profile recruits that were heavily targeted by both institutions. Chris Webber, Michigan's Mr. Basketball in 1991 and the National High School player of the year, chose Michigan over Duke and eventually became the #1 pick in the 1993 NBA Draft after playing two seasons for the Wolverines. Duke returned <b>the</b> <b>favor</b> by gaining a commitment from Michigan-raised Detroit Country Day alum Shane Battier, the 1997 Mr. Basketball of Michigan, who led Duke's 2001 National Championship team, while sweeping all of the National Player of the Year awards. Battier had been a fan of the Fab Five growing up. More recently, Michigan landed Mitch McGary, who had visited only Michigan, Duke and University of North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|As governor, Ford raised {{revenue from}} a {{severance}} tax on coal, a two-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline, {{and an increased}} corporate tax. He balanced these increases by exempting food from the state sales tax. The resulting large budget surplus allowed him to propose several construction projects. His victory in the primary had been largely due to Jefferson County, and he returned <b>the</b> <b>favor</b> by approving funds to build the Commonwealth Convention Center and expand the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center. He also shepherded a package of reforms to the state's criminal justice system through the first legislative session of his term.|$|E
5|$|At the plantation, Northup meets Patsey, {{a favored}} slave who can pick over 500 pounds of cotton a day, twice the usual quota, whom Epps {{regularly}} rapes and abuses. Some time later, cotton worms destroy Epps's cotton. Unable {{to work his}} fields, Epps leases his slaves to a neighboring plantation for the season. While there, Northup gains <b>the</b> <b>favor</b> of the plantation's owner, Judge Turner, who allows him to play the fiddle at a neighbor's wedding anniversary celebration, and to keep his earnings. When Northup returns to Epps, he attempts {{to use the money}} to pay a white field hand and former overseer, Armsby, to mail a letter to his friends in New York State. Armsby agrees, and accepts Northup's saved money, but immediately betrays him to Epps. In {{the middle of the night}} Epps wakes Solomon and questions him menacingly about the letter. Northup is narrowly able to convince Epps that Armsby is lying and Epps relents.|$|E

5|$|In Korean mythology, a tiger and a bear {{prayed to}} Hwanung, {{the son of}} the Lord of Heaven, that they might become human. Upon hearing their prayers, Hwanung gave them 20 cloves of garlic and a bundle of mugwort, {{ordering}} them to eat only this sacred food and remain out of the sunlight for 100 days. The tiger gave up after about twenty days and left the cave. However, the bear persevered and was transformed into a woman. The bear and the tiger are said to represent two tribes that sought <b>the</b> <b>favor</b> of the heavenly prince.|$|E
5|$|New gods {{continued}} to emerge after this transformation. Some important deities like Isis and Amun {{are not known}} to have appeared until the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BC). Places and concepts could suddenly inspire {{the creation of a}} deity to represent them, and deities were sometimes created to serve as opposite-sex counterparts to established gods or goddesses. Kings were said to be divine, although only a few {{continued to}} be worshipped long after their deaths. Some non-royal humans were said to have <b>the</b> <b>favor</b> of the gods and were venerated accordingly. This veneration was usually short-lived, but the court architects Imhotep and Amenhotep son of Hapu were regarded as gods centuries after their lifetimes, as were some other officials.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1884, {{the rivalry}} was played {{annually}} or bi-annually until 1889. All {{of the games}} were hosted at the Naval Academy. According to writers Taylor Baldwin Kiland and Jamie Howren, all games played during that time were hosted on whatever parade or drill field was unused at the time at the Academy, instead of Navy having a specific football-dedicated area. The 1884 game, which was played entirely under the rules of rugby, was a rematch with Johns Hopkins. In the first half, Hopkins scored twice, on a touchdown from a Mr. Bonsall and on a two-point safety. Navy returned <b>the</b> <b>favor</b> {{in the second half}} of the game when halfback Julius Dashiell, brother of Hopkins' Paul Dashiell, kicked a five-point goal and rusher David W. Taylor scored a touchdown to secure a victory.|$|E

5|$|The Persians {{preferred}} a {{battle in the}} open sea, where they could better utilize their superior seamanship and numbers. For the Greeks, the only realistic hope of a decisive victory was to draw the Persians into a constricted area, where their numbers would count for little. The battle at Artemisium had seen attempts to negate the Persian advantage in numbers, but ultimately the Allies may have realised that they needed an even more constricted channel in order to defeat the Persians. Therefore, by rowing into the Straits of Salamis to attack the Greeks, the Persians were playing into the Allies' hands. It seems probable that the Persians would not have attempted this unless the Persians were confident {{of the collapse of}} the Allied navy, and thus Themistocles's subterfuge appears to have {{played a key role in}} tipping the balance in <b>the</b> <b>favor</b> of the Greeks. Salamis was, for the Persians, an unnecessary battle and a strategic mistake.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Rewrite follows {{an interactive}} branching plot line with multiple scenarios, {{and focuses on}} the player character gaining <b>the</b> <b>favor</b> of the six female main characters. There are additional minigames and quests added into the gameplay, which are necessary to complete the game. The game ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for {{the time of its}} release, and charted in the national top 50 twice more afterwards. There have been five manga adaptations based on Rewrite published by ASCII Media Works and Ichijinsha. Comic anthologies, light novels and an art book were also published, as were several music albums. A 24-episode anime television series adaptation, produced by 8-Bit and directed by Tensho, aired between July 2016 and March 2017.|$|E
5|$|There are Han-era {{literary}} {{references to}} tall towers {{found in the}} capital cities; they often served as watchtowers, astronomical observatories, and religious establishments meant to attract <b>the</b> <b>favor</b> of immortals. The court eunuchs Zhao Zhong and Zhang Rang discouraged the aloof Emperor Ling of Han (r. 168–189 CE) from ascending to the top floors of tall towers (claiming it would cause bad luck), in order to conceal from him the enormous palatial mansions the eunuchs built for themselves in Luoyang. It is not known for certain whether or not miniature ceramic models of residential towers and watchtowers found in Han-dynasty tombs are completely faithful representations of such timber towers, yet they reveal vital clues about lost timber architecture.|$|E
