500|$|Mike Thompson {{discovered}} in a poll taken in March 1977 that women in Dade County opposed repealing the measure two to one; they saw their gay friends as relatively harmless. Save Our Children's strategy, therefore, worked to prove that homosexuals were amoral, promiscuous, and defiant of traditional gender roles, {{and that they were}} a specific danger to children. Bryant took this strategy as a crusade, delivering speeches that intoned that Dade County's passing of the ordinance [...] "guts the law {{on the side of the}} unrighteous. If homosexuals are allowed to change the law in their favor, why not prostitutes, thieves, or murderers?" [...] She specifically connected homosexuals with child molesters, saying [...] "Some of <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>I</b> could tell you of child recruitment and child abuse by homosexuals would turn your stomach." [...] Bryant resented the media depiction of her as hateful, saying that her inspiration came [...] "out of love—not only love for God's commandment and His word, but love for my children and yours. Yes, and even love for all sinners—even homosexuals." ...|$|E

60|$|As I started now to pedal {{out into}} the great world, I was icily sober, and the old skill, in consequence, had deserted me entirely.

60|$|Ricker {{seemed quite}} {{unchanged}} {{save for the}} few gray hairs which had come into his beard and, as he stood in conversation {{with one of the}} merchants of the town, his nasal voice, his formal speech and the grandiloquent gesture of his right hand brought back to me all <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>I</b> had heard of his drinking and of his wife's heroic rescuing expeditions to neighboring saloons.

6000|$|Visitors {{who came}} to our house would tell strange tales of this black land, and some of <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>I</b> am {{inclined}} to think were true. One man said he saw a young bull-dog fly at a boy and pin him by the throat. The lad jumped about with much sprightliness, and tried to knock the dog away. Whereupon the boy's father rushed out of the house, hard by, and caught his son and heir roughly by the shoulder. [...] "Keep still, thee young ---, can't 'ee!"
