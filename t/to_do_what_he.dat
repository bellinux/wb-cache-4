5|$|Roland Morris was an {{experienced}} instructor {{with more than}} 2,000 hours. He was critical of Finucane's habit of trying to force the aircraft <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted instead of coaxing it. Despite a series of blunders, Finucane wanted to fly solo. At that time Finucane was five hours flight training behind {{the rest of his}} group, but he made a successful solo trip on 21 September after the completion of 14:05 hours piloting. The flight was not without fault; Finucane nearly stalled the aircraft after taking off.|$|E
5|$|Alongside this, Siddhu applies for a {{bank loan}} {{to start his}} {{construction}} company. When his love for Hasini deepens, he wishes to propose to her. He confesses {{to her that he}} is engaged to Subbulakshmi against his wishes, but who he really wants is her. On learning of his engagement, Hasini gets dejected, but comes back a few days later and asks him <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wishes for and accepts his proposal. At this juncture, the ecstatic Siddhu is seen by a furious Aravind. Siddhu is admonished back home and he expresses his disinterest in marrying Subbulakshmi. When asked for his reason to like Hasini, Siddhu replies that if Hasini can stay with their family for a week, then all their questions shall be answered. He convinces Hasini to stay at his house after lying to her father, Kanaka Rao (Kota Srinivasa Rao) that she is going on a college tour.|$|E

25|$|The Depression {{following}} {{the stock market}} crash of 1929 made it difficult for Mestler to obtain employment, and this he took as a sign that the time had come for him to give up his architectural career, for which he never cared, and <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had always longed to do by exclusively devoting himself to art.|$|E

But when Adam Chandler regains control of Chandler Enterprises, Josh becomes the former CEO of the company.|$|E

The tournament also included hosts Australia, China and Asian power-house South Korea. Adrian was back <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> best. Impressing one and all, Adrian was the number 1 again. Even though India {{did not have a}} successful trip down under, Adrian was feeling good about his form.|$|R

Gwen takes those words to heart, and resolves to stand up for herself. The first stand she takes is to walk out on Archy.|$|R
25|$|Alexander {{often had}} to divide his forces and command was given {{to a variety of}} senior {{officers}} on different occasions. For example, a few weeks before this mission of Hephaestion's, Craterus had been sent with a large force to subdue the last two remaining Bactrian rebels. It seems that Hephaestion was chosen when the objectives were far from clear-cut, and Alexander needed a commander on whom he could rely <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would have done himself without needing instructions.|$|E
25|$|In August, Canaris {{met with}} Franco's brother-in-law, Ramón Serrano Súñer, {{who was about}} to become Spain's Foreign Minister. Canaris urged Serrano Súñer <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could to {{convince}} Franco {{to stay out of the}} war. Soon after, Franco dispatched Serrano Súñer to Berlin to get an idea of Hitler's attitude, since Canaris had assured him that Germany would not forcibly intervene in Spain. When Serrano Súñer met Hitler on 16 September, Hitler did not press very hard for Spanish involvement in the war, perhaps because he planned to meet Franco himself very soon.|$|E
25|$|Samuel: {{a wealthy}} Jewish merchant. He {{made a deal}} with some Gentiles that he would give Azriel's bones to them <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> pleased if they would bring his daughters to safety. Whether Azriel truly loved him in the end or not is a matter of debate, because the scene begins with Azriel begging Samuel to fly him away from the {{oncoming}} pogrom, but ends on a sad note with Azriel being forced back into the bones cursing his master for being a martyr. This begins Azriel's onslaught of all his subsequent masters.|$|E

25|$|His last {{large-scale}} {{work of the}} 1930s was his Piano Concerto, composed for {{the pianist}} Solomon, who gave the world premiere at the World's Fair in New York in June 1939. Bliss and his family attended the performance and then stayed on in the US for a holiday. While they were there, the Second World War broke out. Bliss initially stayed in America, teaching at the University of California, Berkeley. He felt impelled to return to England <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could for the war effort, and in 1941, leaving {{his wife and children}} in California, he made the hazardous Atlantic crossing.|$|E
25|$|Hoover was {{by nature}} an activist and {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could {{to alleviate the}} widespread suffering caused by the Depression, but his strict adherence to what he believed were Republican principles precluded him from establishing relief directly from the federal government. The Depression cost Hoover the presidency with the 1932 landslide election of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt's New Deal coalition controlled American politics {{for most of the}} next three decades, excepting the two-term presidency of Republican Dwight Eisenhower. The Democrats made major gains in the 1930 midterm elections, giving them congressional parity (though not control) {{for the first time since}} Woodrow Wilson's presidency.|$|E

This is the secret that has not yet been told in the affair: the story of the security fiasco that made it possible for Vanunu <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did, and the story of subsequent attempts to cover-up, whitewash and protect senior figures in the defense establishment, who were bent on divesting themselves of responsibility for the failure.|$|E
25|$|Guy {{discovers that}} Gilda is {{living with the}} Spanish-born nursing student/model Mia and has a lover, whom she quickly {{discards}} when Guy moves in.

It is {{the height of the}} Spanish Civil War, and idealistic Guy, a long-time supporter of the army of the Second Spanish Republic, is determined <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> can to help them as Francisco Franco's fascists gain strength. Mia, too, is anxious to {{come to the aid of}} her native land. Gilda, however, has no interest in politics or anything else that might disrupt her life of luxury, and pleads with the two to ignore the conflict, but they feel compelled to act and depart for Spain.|$|E
25|$|Halakha (Jewish law) {{generally}} {{allows for}} divorce. The document of divorce is termed a get. The final divorce ceremony involves the husband giving the get document into {{the hand of}} the wife or her agent, but the wife may sue in rabbinical court to initiate the divorce. In such a case, a husband may be compelled to give the get, if he has violated any of his numerous obligations; this was traditionally accomplished by beating and or monetary coercion. The rationale was that since he was required to divorce his wife due to his (or her) violations of the contract, his good inclination desires to divorce her, and the community helps him <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants to do anyway. In this case, the wife {{may or may not be}} entitled to a payment.|$|E
