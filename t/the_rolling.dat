5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stones {{celebrated their}} 50th anniversary {{in the summer}} of 2012 by {{releasing}} the book <b>The</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stones: 50. A new take on the band's lip-and-tongue logo, designed by Shepard Fairey, was also released and used during the celebrations. Jagger's brother Chris performed a gig at <b>The</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stones Museum in Slovenia in conjunction with the celebrations.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2003, <b>The</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stones {{performed}} in Singapore {{as part of}} their 2002/2003 Licks World Tour. At the first performance, there were two inflatable dolls on stage. Both of the dolls had flags placed in their crotch area; one had <b>the</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stones logo and the other had a Singapore flag. Because of the illegal use of the state flag, and for fear of dealing with the government, the dolls and the flags were removed from the second concert by the organizer.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stones {{remained}} popular {{through the}} early 1970s, music critics had begun to grow dismissive of the band's output, and record sales failed to meet expectations. By the mid-1970s, after punk rock became influential, many people had begun to view <b>the</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stones as an outdated band.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{importance}} of <b>the</b> axial <b>rolling</b> torque to design equipment and process is described. On {{the basis of}} the established formula of axial <b>rolling</b> force, <b>the</b> formula of axial rolling torque is derived by using the moving volume theory of energy method. The influence of processing parameters on <b>the</b> axial <b>rolling</b> torque is investigated. It is found that <b>the</b> axial <b>rolling</b> torque increases with the increase of the outer diameter of ring, and <b>the</b> axial <b>rolling</b> torque decreases with the increase of the inside diameter of ring. The greater the feed in axial direction, the greater <b>the</b> axial <b>rolling</b> torque. <b>The</b> correctness of the formula is verified by calculating actual examples...|$|R
40|$|Research {{results will}} be {{different}} when the boundary condition is changed. In this work, the finite element model of <b>the</b> linear <b>rolling</b> guide of <b>the</b> NC machine tool is established. Then the natural frequencies and the corresponding vibration modals of <b>the</b> linear <b>rolling</b> guide model are obtained with two different boundary conditions. One boundary condition is that the movable joint surface of <b>the</b> linear <b>rolling</b> guide is considered, and regardless {{of the influence of}} the bolt joint surface of the guide. And another boundary condition is that the movable joint surface of <b>the</b> linear <b>rolling</b> guide and <b>the</b> influence of bolt joint surface of the guide are all considered. By comparing the modal characters of the two states, it is proved that the movable joint and bolted interfaces of the guide have certain effects on the dynamic performance of <b>the</b> linear <b>rolling</b> guide. For <b>the</b> experiment, <b>the</b> linear <b>rolling</b> guide also has been tested in two ways, the slider excited and the sliding guide excited respectively. Comparing the results obtained from numerical simulation and experiment, the validity of finite element model and the influence of the boundary conditions on the interface of <b>the</b> linear <b>rolling</b> guide are verified. This will help the dynamic analysis on <b>the</b> linear <b>rolling</b> guide and other research objects. </p...|$|R

5|$|In mid-1982, {{to commemorate}} their 20th anniversary, <b>the</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stones took their American stage show to Europe. The European Tour 1982 {{was their first}} European tour in six years, with a similar format to the American tour. The band were joined by former Allman Brothers Band keyboardist Chuck Leavell, who {{continues}} to perform and record with <b>the</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stones. By {{the end of the}} year, the band had signed a new four-album recording deal with a new label, CBS Records, for a reported $50 million, then the biggest record deal in history.|$|E

25|$|On 28 May 1993 all of <b>the</b> old <b>rolling</b> {{stock was}} withdrawn, the train service being {{suspended}} temporarily. A temporary bus service was run while <b>the</b> old <b>rolling</b> stock was physically removed and <b>the</b> new <b>rolling</b> stock brought in, {{and the track}} and signalling works undertaken, with staff training.

40|$|Dimensions of {{one kind}} of {{stainless}} steel plate before finish rolling were obtained through analysis of <b>the</b> rough <b>rolling</b> processes by finite element method and updated geometrical method. The FE models of finish rolling process with a front edge roll were built, and influences of <b>the</b> edge <b>rolling</b> reduction on <b>the</b> stress change in the plate edge during finish <b>rolling</b> were analyzed. <b>The</b> results show that when <b>the</b> edge <b>rolling</b> reduction is increased from 0 mm to 2 mm, the compressive stress in plate corner clearly increases in edge <b>rolling</b> process, and <b>the</b> zone of tensile stress during whole <b>rolling</b> decreases; when <b>the</b> edge <b>rolling</b> reduction is increased from 2 mm to 5 mm, the compressive stress in the plate corner seldom changes, and the compressive stress decreases after <b>the</b> horizontal <b>rolling...</b>|$|R
5|$|Prior to {{shipment}} of <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> stock to India, Calthrop and the Leeds Forge Company, manufacturer of <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> stock, conducted tests on a specially built test track located at Newlay, near Leeds.

5|$|The Heinz {{executive}} {{speaks with}} Don about his daughters' obsession with <b>The</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stones, and floats {{an idea about}} getting <b>The</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stones to do a commercial for Heinz. Don agrees, though he is unimpressed with the idea. Harry and Don make a Saturday night trip to a Rolling Stones concert to meet with Stones manager Allen Klein. They end up making conversation backstage with two pot-smoking female fans. When Harry leaves {{with one of the}} girls to talk with Klein, Don waxes poetic with one over her love for the band. She makes an insulting comment about the older generation. Don responds that the older generation is simply worried for youth. Harry fails miserably at his attempt to meet with <b>The</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stones, but Don is indifferent.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{samples of}} V-N microalloyed mild steel were {{obtained}} in duo mill with the normal deformation rate and <b>the</b> normal <b>rolling</b> temperature except final rolling temperature, {{which is at}} 780 °C, 730 °C and 680 °C respectively. The tensile test was carried out and the microstructure was observed with optical microscope. It {{was found that the}} mechanical properties improved dramatically compared with normal process, <b>the</b> final <b>rolling</b> temperature is more than 900 °C. The main reason is the fine grain size and second phase particles. With <b>the</b> final <b>rolling</b> temperature decreasing, <b>the</b> mechanical property further improves until <b>the</b> final <b>rolling</b> temperature of 700 °C...|$|R

5|$|After {{performances}} in Japan, China, Australia and New Zealand in March/April 2006, <b>the</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stones tour took a scheduled break before proceeding to Europe; during this break Keith Richards was hospitalised in New Zealand for cranial surgery after a fall {{from a tree}} on Fiji, {{where he had been}} on holiday. The incident led to a six-week delay in launching the European leg of the tour. In June 2006 it was reported that Ronnie Wood was continuing his programme of rehabilitation for alcohol abuse, but this did not affect the rearranged European tour schedule. Two out of the 21 shows scheduled for July–September 2006 were later cancelled due to Mick Jagger's throat problems. <b>The</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stones returned to North America for concerts in September 2006, and returned to Europe on 5 June 2007. By November 2006, the Bigger Bang tour had been declared the highest grossing tour of all time.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1980 the {{eligibility}} year for nominations {{was set to}} the calendar year, rather than December–November as initially conceived, and the SFWA organizing panel was allowed to add an additional work. Authors were also allowed to use the mass-market paperback publication of their books {{as the beginning of}} their nomination period, rather than the initial hardback publication. As a consequence of the combination of this rule and <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> eligibility, the 2007 awards, despite nominally being for works published in 2006, instead were all given to works initially published in 2005. Beginning with the 2010 awards, <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> eligibility system and paperback publication exemption were replaced with the current rules.|$|E
