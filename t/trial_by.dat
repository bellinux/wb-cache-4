5|$|The court {{decided that}} the {{evidence}} against Thornton was not overwhelming, and that <b>trial</b> <b>by</b> battle was a permissible option under law; thus Thornton was granted <b>trial</b> <b>by</b> battle. Ashford declined the offer of battle and Thornton was freed from custody. Appeals such as Ashford's were abolished by statute in 1819, and with {{them the right to}} <b>trial</b> <b>by</b> battle. Thornton emigrated to the United States, where he died around 1860.|$|E
5|$|The {{privilege}} of <b>trial</b> <b>by</b> peers was still ill-defined, and the statute did not cover peeresses. In 1442, after an ecclesiastical court (which included King Henry VI of England, Henry Beaufort and John Kemp) found Eleanor, Duchess of Gloucester, guilty of witchcraft and banished {{her to the}} Isle of Man, a statute was enacted granting peeresses the right of <b>trial</b> <b>by</b> peers.|$|E
50|$|Priestly {{cooperation}} in <b>trials</b> <b>by</b> fire and water was forbidden by Pope Innocent III at the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 and replaced <b>by</b> compurgation. <b>Trials</b> <b>by</b> ordeal became rarer over the Late Middle Ages, but {{the practice was}} discontinued only in the 16th century.

5|$|Depending on the {{authorized}} {{and actual}} sentence, upon demand, a criminal defendant {{has a right}} to <b>trial</b> <b>by</b> jury. The defendant does not have a right, conversely, to a bench trial without the consent of the prosecution.

Further, the defendant has a right to a <b>trial</b> <b>by</b> jury if the actual sentence exceeds six months and the charged crime has no maximum authorized sentence (e.g. contempt of court).|$|E

5|$|Even {{after the}} initial {{production}} of <b>Trial</b> <b>by</b> Jury, however, Carte continued to produce continental operetta, touring {{in the summer of}} 1876 with a repertoire consisting of English adaptations of French opera bouffe (Offenbach’s La Périchole, and La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein, Lecocq's La fille de Madame Angot and Léon Vasseur's La Timbale d'argent), paired with two one-act English after-pieces (Happy Hampstead and <b>Trial</b> <b>by</b> Jury). Carte acted as the musical director of this travelling company that included W.H. Denny.|$|E

5|$|In 1875, Carte {{became the}} {{business}} {{manager of the}} Royalty Theatre, {{under the direction of}} his client, the popular singing actress Madame Selina Dolaro. There he programmed Offenbach's La Périchole. To fill out the evening (as long programmes were the fashion in Victorian theatre), he needed another piece. He remembered a libretto for a one-act comic opera that W. S. Gilbert had written and shown to him in 1873, called <b>Trial</b> <b>by</b> Jury. Meanwhile, Sullivan's popular 1867 opera, Cox and Box, had been revived at the Gaiety Theatre in 1874, and Carte had already asked him to write a piece for the Royalty. Carte knew that Gilbert had worked with Sullivan to create Thespis in 1871, and he now suggested that Sullivan could write the music for <b>Trial</b> <b>by</b> Jury. Because Gilbert and Sullivan shared his vision of increasing the quality and respectability of English musical theatre, and so broadening its audience through the promotion of well-crafted English light operas, Carte gave them wider authority as director and music director than was customary at that time. <b>Trial</b> <b>by</b> Jury, a comic treatment of an English courtroom, was an unexpected hit, outrunning La Périchole, and becoming the first step in Carte's scheme to establish a new genre of English comic opera.|$|E

Now peers are tried by juries composed of commoners, though peers were themselves excused from jury service until the House of Lords Act 1999 restricted this privilege to members of the House of Lords.
