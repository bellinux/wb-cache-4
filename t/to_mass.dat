5|$|By {{the second}} half of the 20th century, {{developments}} in electronic media made possible the delivery of entertainment products <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> audiences across the globe. The technology enabled people to see, hear and participate in all the familiar forms stories, theatre, music, dance wherever they live. The rapid development of entertainment technology was assisted by improvements in data storage devices such as cassette tapes or compact discs, along with increasing miniaturisation. Computerisation and the development of barcodes also made ticketing easier, faster and global.|$|E
5|$|Claims of {{intermediate}} mass {{black holes}} {{have been met}} with some skepticism. The heaviest objects in globular clusters are expected to migrate to the cluster center due <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> segregation. As pointed out in two papers by Holger Baumgardt and collaborators, the mass-to-light ratio should rise sharply towards {{the center of the}} cluster, even without a black hole, in both M15 and Mayall II.|$|E
5|$|During the 1941 {{collapse}} of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia under the Axis invasion in the April War, the Independent State of Croatia was created. It was ruled by the extreme nationalist Ustaša regime. The Ustaša quickly started with the systematic persecution of the Jews, modeled after the Nazi Germany approach, and at times even more brutal. Racial laws were introduced, Jewish property was confiscated, and the Jews were subjected <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> arrests and deportations to death camps in Croatia and abroad.|$|E

Böhme rigorously enforced the rule that for every German killed, 100 Serbs or Jews would be shot. The resistance movement in Belgrade was led by Major Žarko Todorović from 1941 until his arrest in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Historically, auls were a Circassian type {{of rural}} locality. Many of the present-day auls were founded during 1850 to 1925, when the Adyghe people were subject <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> deportations as a {{consequence}} of the Caucasian War of 1817–1864. These auls tend to be located in mountainous or otherwise difficult-to-access terrains, while most of those established after the Caucasian War are found on the plains beside the Caucasus Mountains.|$|E
5|$|In the {{electromagnetic}} process, {{a magnetic field}} deflected charged particles according <b>to</b> <b>mass.</b> The process was neither scientifically elegant nor industrially efficient.

5|$|The oceans {{may have}} become more hospitable to life over the last 500million years and less {{vulnerable}} <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> extinctions: dissolved oxygen became more widespread and penetrated to greater depths; the development of life on land reduced the run-off of nutrients and hence the risk of eutrophication and anoxic events; marine ecosystems became more diversified so that food chains {{were less likely to}} be disrupted.|$|E
5|$|A {{shortage}} of engines {{was a major}} obstacle <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> production {{and development of the}} IK-3, so tests were conducted with more powerful engines, including the Daimler-Benz DB 601, Rolls-Royce Merlin II and Hispano-Suiza 12Y51. The tests were incomplete {{at the time of the}} Axis invasion, and the only prototype to be fitted with a non-production engine was destroyed by factory personnel along with the incomplete production aircraft. Development of a dual-control two-seat trainer variant of the IK-3 had commenced but pressure on the design team had delayed the completion of the project when the invasion intervened.|$|E

The band formed in 2000 in the San Francisco area, and eventually signed to Dim Mak Records in 2002. The band's first album, From Monument <b>To</b> <b>Masses,</b> was initially {{intended to be a}} demo recording to find a label; however, when Dim Mak's label owner Steve Aoki, who was also a long-time friend of Robledo-Maderazo from the Southern California Hardcore scene and his UCSB classmate, heard the recording, he signed the band and decided to release it as an eponymous debut LP.|$|R

5|$|Coburg {{took up a}} {{defensive}} position at Neerwinden and awaited the confident Dumouriez's attack. The Coalition army was outnumbered in infantry but possessed a two-to-one superiority in cavalry. After intense fighting, Coburg's troops repulsed the attacks of the French center and right wing. When Dumouriez found that his left wing was driven off the battlefield, he began retreating. The defeat led <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> desertions from the discouraged French volunteers. In {{the face of the}} military collapse, Dumouriez negotiated a free withdrawal of French troops in return for the surrender of Belgium and Dutch territory. Soon, Dumouriez was plotting against his own government and when his plans failed, he defected to the Austrians, leaving the French army in chaos.|$|E
5|$|Electromagnetic isotope {{separation}} {{was developed by}} Lawrence at the University of California Radiation Laboratory. This method employed devices known as calutrons, a hybrid of the standard laboratory mass spectrometer and cyclotron. The name {{was derived from the}} words California, university and cyclotron.

5|$|In 1510, a Portuguese fleet under Afonso de Albuquerque, sent by King Manuel I of Portugal, wrested {{the region}} of Goa from Sultan Yusuf Adil Shah of Bijapur. In 1534, the Diocese of Goa was established. Soon missionaries were sent to Goa, which led to {{conversion}} of a sizeable population to Roman Catholicism. The bulk of Christian settlers came in three major migration waves towards South Canara. These migrations occurred in periods of great unrest: the Goa Inquisition occurred from 1560 onwards; the Portuguese–Adil Shahi wars were between 1570–79; and the Portuguese–Maratha wars occurred between 1667–83 and 1737–40. Other factors that led <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> migrations were disease epidemics, famines, natural calamities, overpopulation, poor living conditions, heavy tax burdens, and social discrimination by the Portuguese.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, the Rowlatt Act gave {{extensive}} {{powers to}} the British government and police, and allowed indefinite {{arrest and detention}} of individuals, warrant-less searches and seizures, restrictions on public gatherings, and intensive censorship of media and publications. The public opposition to this act eventually led <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> campaigns of non-violent civil disobedience throughout the country demanding guaranteed civil freedoms, and limitations on government power. Indians, who were seeking independence and their own government, were particularly influenced by the independence of Ireland {{and the development of}} the Irish constitution. Also, the directive principles of state policy in Irish constitution were looked upon by the people of India as an inspiration for the independent India's government to comprehensively tackle complex social and economic challenges across a vast, diverse nation and population.|$|E
5|$|In {{a series}} of {{conflicts}} in 1803–15 known as the Napoleonic Wars, various European powers formed five coalitions against the First French Empire. Like the wars sparked by the French Revolution (1789), these further revolutionized the formation, organization and training of European armies and led to an unprecedented militarization, mainly due <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> conscription. Under the leadership of Napoleon, French power rose quickly as the Grande Armée conquered most of Europe, and collapsed rapidly after the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812. Napoleon's empire ultimately suffered complete military defeat in the 1813–14 campaigns, resulting in {{the restoration of the}} Bourbon monarchy in France. Although Napoleon made a spectacular return in 1815, known as the Hundred Days, his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, the pursuit of his army and himself, his abdication and banishment to the Island of Saint Helena concluded the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E

5|$|Leeds' {{growth in}} the 19th century led <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> {{migration}} to the city; this resulted {{in many areas of}} the city becoming overcrowded and many new houses being built. The industrial revolution led to the increase in both working and middle classes, leading to the building of many new houses, aimed at both classes. The most common form of housing to be built for the working classes was the 'back to back'. Back to back terrace houses were built in the largely working class districts of Harehills, Holbeck, Hunslet, Beeston and Armley, whilst larger through terrace houses were built for the middle classes in Headingley and Kirkstall. Chapeltown developed as an affluent district of Leeds, and boasts many large Victorian villas, however the popularity of outer suburbs such as Roundhay towards the late 20th century brought land values down in Chapeltown and the area fell into decline.|$|E
