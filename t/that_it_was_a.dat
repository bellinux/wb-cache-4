40|$|This article reviews {{standard}} and recent interpretations of cultural nationalism.

Twiss in 1959 at Jodrell Bank using their stellar intensity interferometer.

40|$|Market orientation, viewed {{mostly as}} an {{implementation}} of the marketing concept, {{is probably one of}} the most studied areas of marketing.

5|$|A large tumulus of {{uncertain}} {{origin and}} purpose stands approximately {{in the middle}} of the excavated area, between the old and new parts of the city.

5|$|A notable {{find in the}} Fosse Way burials was a Chi-Rho amulet, at {{the time}} thought {{to be from the}} 5th century, and {{considered}} to be among the earliest definite evidence of Christianity in England.

Crew members were yelling at Andrew <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> moccasin, but Prine wanted to finish his scene without reshooting, so the crew killed the snake afterwards.

5|$|Argentina had a tense {{relationship}} with the United Kingdom because of the recently ended Falklands War. The British government banned all foreign ships from the exclusion zone of the islands in 1986. Argentina organised air and marine patrols, as well as military maneuvers in the Patagonia. However, this {{was not enough to}} placate the military hard-liners in Argentina. Alfonsín proposed the postponement the sovereignty discussions, instead negotiating for a de jure cease of hostilities, with a {{reduction in the number of}} military forces and a normalization of Argentina–United Kingdom relations. The United Kingdom did not trust the proposal, suspecting <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> cover-up for sovereignty discussions.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} nineteen, Trenyce {{was arrested}} for theft at work.

Trenyce attended the University of Memphis on a full music scholarship. While in college, she joined the University Singers ensemble choir and its band Sound Fuzion, which toured throughout Tennessee.

5|$|Bethe {{managed to}} work it out on the train from New York to Schenectady. He arrived at a value of 1040MHz, {{extremely}} close to that obtained experimentally by Lamb and Retherford. He did so by realising <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> non-relativistic process, which greatly simplified the calculations. His paper, published in the Physical Review in August 1947 was only two pages long and contained just 12 mathematical equations, but was enormously influential. Hitherto, it had been assumed that the infinities meant that QED was fundamentally flawed, and that a new, radical theory was required. Bethe demonstrated that this was not necessary.|$|E
5|$|British {{ichthyologist}} Charles Tate Regan described Spheroides liosomus in 1909 from specimens {{collected in}} Melbourne, Hobart, Flinders Island and Port Phillip. He noted {{its lack of}} spines compared with specimens of Tetrodon hamiltonii, and hence argued <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> distinct and separate species. Australian biologist Gilbert Whitley equated Regan's description with Fréminville's original naming and gave it the combination Spheroides glaber in 1955, and later Gastrophysus glaber in 1964.|$|E

In 1926, he became a consultant for the Lamp Department at General Electric. In 1934, he returned to England as Eastman visiting professor at Oxford University. While there General Electric asked him to report on activities at General Electric Company plc's research laboratory at Wembley. Compton was intrigued by the possibilities of the research there into fluorescent lamps. His report prompted a research program in America that developed it.|$|E
