5|$|Bosi had {{previously}} been head chef and won a Michelin star at the Overton Grange restaurant, just outside the town. He had intended to open a restaurant in Warwickshire, but found the premises <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> purchased a 25-year lease on the former Oaks property in Ludlow for £40,000. Within a year Hibiscus won its first Michelin star, {{and at the same}} time Overton Grange was downgraded before going into receivership.|$|E
5|$|Since Close Encounters {{was filmed}} anamorphically, the visual effects {{sequences}} were shot on 70 mm film to better conform with the 35 mm film {{used for the}} rest of the movie. A test reel using computer-generated imagery was used for the UFOs, but Spielberg found it would be <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> ineffective since CGI was in its infancy in the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|One {{suggested}} {{route for}} an O-Bahn was for an alignment {{adjacent to the}} Noarlunga Centre railway line from {{the city to the}} Tonsley railway line. The O-Bahn would end there, with buses continuing on the Southern Expressway through the far south. Construction of this O-Bahn would require moving the railway track slightly to fit the O-Bahn alongside. In addition, Emerson Crossing and the Goodwood tram overpass would require alteration. The estimated cost of construction, $182million, was considered <b>too</b> <b>expensive,</b> <b>and</b> the proposal was suspended in 2001. Since then, the Government has focused on road upgrades and an inner-city light rail extension.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{dismantled}} in 1975 immediately {{after completion of}} a third span.

5|$|The {{original}} {{idea for the}} short was a magician who incorporated a rabbit into his act who suffered from stage fright. This {{was considered to be}} too long and complicated, and the idea was reworked. To design the theater featured in Presto, the filmmakers visited several opera houses and theaters for set design ideas. Problems arose when trying to animate the theater's audience of 2,500 patrons; this was deemed <b>too</b> <b>expensive,</b> <b>and</b> was solved by showing the back of the audience.|$|E
5|$|This was the {{original}} idea for the story to open the tenth season. This story took aspects from The Seventh Seal, with the ruler of the Time Lords playing a variation of Chess with Death, who was leading a Federation of Evil. The three Doctors would get transported to an Underworld-like realm, where they would face such creatures of evil like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and the Seven Deadly Sins. This was deemed <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> not suitable for a family show.|$|E
5|$|According to Beesley, {{many have}} written that {{interest}} in the Deseret alphabet died with Brigham Young. This, however, isn't true; the alphabet was already regarded as a failure during Young's time. Only 500 copies of the full Book of Mormon translated into the Deseret alphabet sold for US$2 each, and even Young realized that the venture was <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> even the most devout Mormons could not be convinced to purchase and study the Deseret edition books over the books in the traditional orthography. In the winter of 1870, just one year after their publication, advertisements for the Deseret alphabet books were quietly removed from the Deseret News.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{conductors}} {{and engineers}} often {{knew where the}} locals lived or were headed, trains would make non-scheduled stops to disembark passengers to allow them a shorter walk. In the 1960s, the number of round trips was reduced to three per day, allowing the whole service to be operated with a single unit. NSB used steam power for freight trains until 1970, when NSB's last scheduled steam locomotive service hauled a gravel train from Svene to Kongsberg. For a short period during the 1980s, there were also school trains, but as this forced NSB to operate two multiple units on the line, it proved <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> was soon afterwards again provided by bus.|$|E
5|$|Bushnell and Gene Lipkin, Atari's {{vice-president}} of sales, approached toy and electronic retailers to sell Home Pong, but were rejected. Retailers felt {{the product was}} <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> would not interest consumers. Atari contacted the Sears Sporting Goods department after noticing a Magnavox Odyssey advertisement in the sporting goods section of its catalog. Atari staff discussed {{the game with a}} representative, Tom Quinn, who expressed enthusiasm and offered the company an exclusive deal. Believing they could find more favorable terms elsewhere, Atari's executives declined and continued to pursue toy retailers. In January 1975, Atari staff set up a Home Pong booth at a toy trade fair in New York City, but was unsuccessful in soliciting orders {{due to the fact that}} they did not know that they needed a private showing.|$|E
5|$|For Shaw's Ferrari, it {{was decided}} that {{purchasing}} an actual model of which only 350 exist and would cost at least $1million would be <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> the vehicle would be unsuitable for filming purposes. Instead, two replicas were commissioned, a process which took three months under the supervision of prop master Peter Gelfman. The replicas then received additional reinforcement for filming purposes from Steve Kirshoff and the special effects crew. After running camera tests on several authentic Ferrari colors, {{it was decided}} to paint the replicas bright red {{in order to create a}} lasting impression instead of using the actual metallic brown muted-coloring of McQueen's vehicle.|$|E

50|$|The Oil-for-Food Program {{however in}} itself faced criticism, with many alleging {{that it was}} <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> to {{administer}} <b>and</b> liable to abuse. The program was discontinued on the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq.|$|R
5|$|The M32 was {{considered}} inadequate for {{its role as}} an armored recovery vehicle, especially during the Korean War, because of the narrow tracks which gave the vehicle insufficient flotation to wade through water and the horsepower of the engine was insufficient to pull large tanks, such as the M26 Pershing. Some M32B1s were also shipped to Britain under Lend-Lease, where they were designated the ARV Mark III by the British Army. The Ordnance Department attempted to replace the M32 with the T12 Armored Recovery Vehicle in 1944 in M26 Pershing companies, but the T12 became <b>too</b> <b>expensive,</b> <b>and</b> so was never put on the production line. The M32 was also planned to have mine-exploding equipment, such as the T1E1 Earthworm and the T2E1 Mine Exploder. However, only the T1E1 had any service with the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{remained}} {{the property of}} the Clarendons until 1937, when Lord Clarendon found the maintenance of the castle <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> sold Kenilworth to the industrialist Sir John Siddeley. Siddeley, whose tax accounting in the 1930s had been at least questionable, was keen to improve his public image and gave over the running of the castle, complete with a charitable donation, to the Commissioner of Works. In 1958 his son gave the castle itself to the town of Kenilworth and English Heritage has managed the property since 1984. The castle is classed as a Grade I listed building and as a Scheduled Monument, and is open to the public.|$|E
5|$|The film is both {{a parody}} and tribute {{to many of the}} science fiction and horror movies from the 1930s up to the 1970s. The film {{production}} retains many aspects from the stage version such as production design and music, but adds new scenes not featured in the original stage play. The film's plot, setting, and style echo those of the Hammer Horror films, which had their own instantly recognizable style (just as Universal Studios' horror films did). The originally proposed opening sequence was to contain clips of various films mentioned in the lyrics, as well as the first few sequences shot in black and white, but this was deemed <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> scrapped.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{transferred}} to the Mediterranean Fleet at Malta in 1918, where she served until she was paid off in late 1919. Vindex was originally intended to be retained for service with the fleet {{after the end of the}} war, but this proved to be <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> she was sold back to her original owners on 12 February 1920 and reverted to her original name. She was requisitioned again in 1939 and served through the Second World War as a troopship, but not as HMS Vindex. The ship was returned to her owners in 1945 and was finally sold for scrap in 1954.|$|E
5|$|The sisters {{returned}} home in 1946; Indefatigable {{was used for}} the rest of the year to transport troops before being placed in reserve in 1947 and Implacable became the training carrier for Home Fleet. Indefatigable was converted into a training ship and reactivated in 1950 for service with the Home Fleet. Implacable was relegated to the reserve that same year and modified into a training ship in 1952. The sisters were scheduled for modernisation during the mid-1950s, but it was cancelled as the modernisation of the carrier in the queue ahead of them proved to be <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> lengthy. The sisters were decommissioned in 1954 and sold for scrap in 1955–56.|$|E
5|$|Added to {{the state}} highway system in 1933, and defined in 1935, Route198 {{extended}} from US 80 onto La Mesa Boulevard and Palm Avenue to SR94 by 1938. In 1947, the San Diego County Highway Development Association requested that the highway from Sixth Avenue in Mission Valley to US 80 be constructed as a freeway. Although state senator Fred Kraft criticized the proposal in July 1953 because he believed {{that it would be}} <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> would not reduce congestion in the long-term, especially around the junction with US 80 in Grossmont, approval for the Route 94 freeway extended to the junction with U.S. Route 80 (US80) by October, with the Grossmont part of the route signed as Route 67. The Route 67 freeway was completed in March 1957, from Campo Road and Route 94 to US 80; the project was completed for $1,625,000.|$|E

50|$|Some, {{including}} Gilbert's {{own daughter}} Leatrice Gilbert Fountain, have blamed MGM studio chief Louis B. Mayer for deliberately perpetuating {{a rumor that}} Gilbert's voice was unsuitable for sound in order to drive out a star whom he judged to be <b>too</b> <b>expensive,</b> <b>too</b> cocky, <b>and</b> approaching his use-by date. Mayer and Gilbert undoubtedly shared a strong enmity, and according to rumors, Mayer knew that the script was substandard, and deliberately hired an out-of-condition Lionel Barrymore as the director.|$|R
50|$|Based on {{the warm}} {{reception}} the concept vehicle received, the Pontiac Trans Sport was approved for production, but {{as is often}} the case, the styling and features showcased on the concept did not make the translation to the mass-produced edition. The gullwing door was deemed <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> to produce <b>and</b> would probably have impacted overhead doors in suburban garages. The glass roof was <b>too</b> heavy <b>and</b> <b>expensive,</b> so the resultant production vehicle made-do with high-gloss black painted panels for the roof to suggest the glass canopy of the concept.|$|R
5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{assigned}} to the Channel Fleet upon commissioning in 1865. Scorpion was refitted in 1867 with a flying bridge that connected the forecastle to the poop, above the tops of the turrets, and her sailing rig was reduced to a fore-and-aft rig. The ship recommissioned in 1868 for another tour with the Channel Fleet. She arrived in Bermuda in November 1869 where she became the local guard ship. In 1873 a proposal was made to remove her poop and forecastle, masts and deck fitting to convert her to a harbour defence monitor with all-around fire, but this was deemed <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> the project was abandoned in 1878. At some point during her service in Bermuda her rigging was removed and she was reduced to simple pole masts. The ship was fitted with searchlights and quick-firing guns in 1890. Scorpion was sunk as a target in 1901; she was raised in 1902 and sold in February 1903 for £736. She sank while under tow to Boston, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Chesma {{was named}} after the Russian victory at the Battle of Chesma in 1770. She was built by the Russian Steam Navigation Company (RoPIT) at Sevastopol. She was laid down in late June 1883, {{launched}} on 18 May 1886, and completed on 29 May 1889. She served with the Black Sea Fleet until 1907. She was inactive in 1895, probably for mechanical problems. Chesma conducted trials in 1902 with towing spherical observation balloons and she was re-boilered the following year. Plans were made for a radical reconstruction to be done while her boilers were being replaced. The rebuilding involved cutting her down by one deck and replacing her armament with two twin-gun turrets equipped with 12-inch 40-caliber guns and ten 6-inch 45-caliber guns between the turrets in an armoured citadel that used Krupp armor. This proved to be <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> it was cancelled, but not before the armor and turrets had been ordered. Her turrets were used to equip the pre-dreadnought , then under construction.|$|E
5|$|Downtown Bakersfield {{was heavily}} {{impacted}} by the earthquakes, and many damaged buildings were bulldozed {{to make room for}} buildings that were eventually constructed with newer architectural styles. After World War II, and with a booming economy, the region was experiencing a period of urban renewal. The Kern County Courthouse, St. Francis Church, and the original Beale Memorial Clock Tower were all damaged and were leveled or rebuilt. In what may have been an overambitious push for renewal, some historic buildings that may have been able to be salvaged also were brought down, though some stood for many years after the earthquakes. Some of Bakersfield's unreinforced masonry buildings survived the shocks and were still in use years later, but the cost of retrofitting these buildings was often prohibitive for their owners, and the Bakersfield City Council was given the authority to seize or demolish them in 1993. The city changed its approach in the late 1990s after building owners complained that the upgrade process was <b>too</b> <b>expensive,</b> <b>and</b> the possibility that the city may be left in possession of properties that were left needing the costly renovations.|$|E
