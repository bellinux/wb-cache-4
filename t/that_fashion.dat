To honour him, the Canadiens retired his jersey number, 7, on November 2, 1937, {{the first time the}} team honoured a player in <b>that</b> <b>fashion.</b> Five days later, on November 7, 1937, a benefit all-star game was held at the Forum {{to raise money for the}} Morenz family. A team {{composed}} of players from the Canadiens and Maroons was defeated 6–5 by a team of players from the other NHL teams.|$|E
5|$|If {{the office}} of {{governor}} becomes vacant through death, resignation, or conviction on impeachment, the lieutenant governor becomes governor {{for the remainder of}} the term; if the office is only temporarily vacant due to disability of the governor, the lieutenant governor only acts out the duties of governor. Should both offices be vacant, the president pro tempore of the state senate becomes governor. The position of lieutenant governor was created in the 1874 constitution; prior to then, the speaker of the senate would act as governor in cases of vacancy. Originally, the lieutenant governor could only act as governor; it was not until the 1968 constitution that the lieutenant governor could actually become governor in <b>that</b> <b>fashion.</b> The office of governor has been vacant for an extended period once, a 17-day gap in 1848 between the resignation of the previous governor and the swearing in of his acting successor. Governors and lieutenant governors are elected on the same ticket.|$|E

25|$|The street {{architecture}} of Chinatown's buildings, the shophouses especially, combine different elements of baroque architecture and Victorian architecture {{and do not}} have a single classification. Many of them were built in the style of painted ladies, and have been restored in <b>that</b> <b>fashion.</b> These styles result in a variety of different colours of which pastel is most dominant. Trengganu Street, Pagoda Street and Temple Street are such examples of this architecture, as well as development in Upper Cross Street and the houses in Club Street. Boat Quay was once a slave market along the Singapore River, Boat Quay has the most mixed-style shophouses on the island.|$|E

Imran Amed stated that there will always be designers and editors that will never fully wrap their head on the huge impact fashion blogging and social media has on the industry, but {{on the other side of}} the spectrum, there are numerous designers, editors, branders and writers that do understand and are “coming on board”. He also states that this is a fairly new phenomenon that will take time for fashion world to reap the full benefits.|$|E
25|$|Malay {{poetry is}} highly developed, and uses many forms. A Hikayat is a {{traditional}} narrative, and stories written in <b>that</b> <b>fashion</b> are named using Hikayat followed by the name(s) of the protagonist(s). The pantun {{is a form of}} poetry used in many aspects of Malay culture. The Syair is another form of narrative, once very popular. The Hikayat form remains popular, and the pantun has spread from Malay to other languages. Until the 19thcentury, literature produced in Malaysia focused mainly on tales of royalty, as it was produced just for royalty. It was after this point that it expanded to other areas. The race riots of 1969 strongly influenced literature; the improvements of the economy in the 1980s brought about social changes and new forms of literature.|$|E
25|$|From 1948, Bailey, now {{resident}} as {{a farmer}} near Hereford, began playing cricket fairly regularly as a middle order batsman and medium-pace bowler for Gloucestershire's second eleven in the Minor Counties championship. In 1949, {{he made his}} first-class cricket debut in a heavy defeat for Gloucestershire away to Somerset at Taunton, batting at No 7, scoring 0 and 5, and not bowling. He then retained his place {{for the next five}} first team matches, though his record of 70 runs at a batting average of 8.75 runs per innings and a tally of just two wickets indicates little success. He was, however, awarded his county cap. He played – more as a batsman than as a bowler – for the second eleven later the same season, and continued in <b>that</b> <b>fashion</b> for the second team across 1950, until the match with Surrey's second eleven at the end of July 1950 when, with Gloucestershire facing a heavy defeat by that season's Minor Counties champions, Bailey opened the innings and scored an unbeaten 129 to save the match.|$|E

500|$|Coke's {{behaviour}} {{during the}} trial has been repeatedly criticised; on this weak evidence, he called Raleigh a [...] "notorious traitor", [...] "vile viper" [...] and [...] "damnable atheist", perverting the law and using every {{slip of the tongue}} as a way of further showing Raleigh's guilt. Raleigh was found guilty and imprisoned in the Tower of London {{for more than a decade}} before finally being executed. It is generally concluded that the trial was biased strongly against Raleigh, although the assessment of Coke varies. While Magruder, in the Scottish Law Review, writes that Coke's [...] "fair fame was tarnished and outraged" [...] by his part in the trial, Boyer notes that Coke was, above all, loyal. He prosecuted Raleigh in <b>that</b> <b>fashion</b> because he had been asked to show Raleigh's guilt by the king, and as Attorney General, Coke was bound to obey.|$|E
