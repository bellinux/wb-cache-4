5|$|After John Firth's death, Arthur {{moved with}} his family to London. According to Richardson they lived in the area around Liverpool Street in the east of the city, {{although}} Knight gives a different account, stating that they lived first in Bedford Park and then Kensington, both in the west of the city. From January 1911 to December 1912 Fortune studied at Studley Agricultural College in Warwickshire, a horticultural institution which advertised itself as being ideal for girls with psychological problems. Her proficiency with poultry led her to become a staff member at the college from January to April 1913. She later claimed <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> college she was the victim of mental manipulation from her employer, the college warden Lillias Hamilton, resulting in a mental breakdown that made her abandon the institution and return to her parental home.|$|E

In one incident, he and his brother Heman went to the farm of a neighbor, some of whose pigs had escaped onto their land, and seized the pigs. The neighbor sued to have the animals returned to him; Allen pleaded his own case, and lost. Allen and Heman were fined ten shillings, and the neighbor was awarded another five shillings in damages. He was also called to court in Salisbury for inoculating himself against smallpox, a procedure <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time required the sanction of the town selectmen.|$|E

5|$|Although Newcastle had {{two games}} in hand over Manchester United going into April, their {{advantage}} was slim in comparison <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of January when Newcastle had a 12-point lead over Manchester United. When both teams met in March at St James' Park, Cantona scored the winning goal for Manchester United and goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel produced a number of outstanding saves which prevented midfielder Peter Beardsley and striker Les Ferdinand from scoring. The win was Manchester United's ninth successive victory in the league, who also beat Newcastle 2–0 in the corresponding fixture at Old Trafford in December 1995.|$|E

5|$|At {{the scene}} of the shooting, Scully reasons <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> short range from which Goodensnake was shot, it would have been {{impossible}} to mistake him for an animal. However, Mulder finds tracks leading to the area that appear to change from human to something more animal in nature. Scully dismisses this, but finds a large section of shed human skin nearby. She believes that the Parkers knowingly killed Goodensnake, but knows that they could not have skinned him since no signs of such injury were found on the body.|$|E

5|$|Attalus was now {{forced to}} return to Asia, for he had learned at Opus <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{instigation}} of Philip, Prusias I king of Bithynia, related to Philip by marriage, was moving against Pergamon. Soon after, the Romans also abandoned Greece to concentrate their forces against Hannibal, their objective of preventing Philip from aiding Hannibal having been achieved. In 206BC the Aetolians sued for peace on conditions imposed by Philip. A treaty was drawn up at Phoenice in 205BC, formally ending the First Macedonian War. Attalus was included as an adscriptus {{on the side of}} Rome. He retained Aegina, but had accomplished little else. Since Prusias was also included in the treaty, the war between Attalus and Prusias must also have ended by that time.|$|E
