25|$|In the endgame, {{it comes}} down to a race over who can checkmate the {{opponent}} first. A tactic known as speed counting {{plays an important role in}} the endgame. By counting the number of moves until checkmate (assuming the opponent doesn't get to move) for both Black and White, <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>help</b> to influence decisions on whether to attack or defend. A simple mistake can change the flow of the game drastically. Among this, there are many other delicate factors to look out for within the endgame, including sacrificial attacks and traps.|$|E

25|$|There {{are other}} {{essential}} aspects of emergency psychiatry: observation and collateral information. The {{observation of the}} patient's behavior is {{an important aspect of}} emergency psychiatry inasmuch as it allows the clinicians working with the patient to estimate prognosis and improvements/declines in condition. Many jurisdictions base involuntary commitment on dangerousness or the inability to care for one's basic needs. Observation {{for a period of time}} may help determine this. For example, if a patient who is committed for violent behavior in the community, continues to behave in an erratic manner without clear purpose, <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>help</b> the staff decide that hospital admission may be needed.|$|E

25|$|Christmas {{is celebrated}} for three days. On {{the second day}} of Christmas, neighbors visit each other. On the third day, Christmas straw is taken out of the house. Little bundles are made with it, and hung on fruit trees to make their fruit better. A bigger bundle may be stored in a dry place: it will be burned on St. George's Day, as a {{protection}} of fields against hail. Another bundle is taken away across the nearest stream – a symbolic elimination of all the vermin that may be present in the house. Men make crosses from the remnant of the thicker side of badnjak, and stick them under eaves, on fields, meadows, vineyards, and apiaries. It is believed <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>help</b> that the ensuing year be happy and fruitful. A good sign that this will be the case is when {{there is a lot of}} snow on Christmas Day.|$|E

It runs a 5-a-side football league and Screamin' Wheels Skate Park. In 2009 it was announced that a £5million youth centre would be built in the town. Based on designs by pupils from Broadoak Secondary School, the centre will provide facilities for workshops in dance, film-making, and art. Headmaster of the school, Andy Griffin, said [...] "It's a massive thing for Partington as <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>help</b> kick-start regeneration of the town.

500|$|The {{album was}} not {{finished}} until {{the night before}} mastering. Chater had a flight to New York City at 7:30 in the morning. Di Blasi stated, [...] "so we’re in the studio till 6:30 that morning till he literally was like ‘I gotta go man, I gotta hop on the plane.’ We were like, ‘we think it sounds good. Fuck it.’" [...] Many tracks the Avalanches considered for Wildflower {{did not make it}} into the album because they did not contribute to its overall style. Collaborators on these songs included Jens Lekman, Connan Mockasin, [...] August Darnell, and Luke Steele. Once the style was more defined, they picked from tracks they had worked on which fell in line with others, similar to making a mix tape. The group intends to release these recordings that were closely related to Wildflower [...] "within a year or so" [...] of the album's release. <b>This</b> <b>will</b> <b>help</b> them [...] "clean the slate" [...] for new music to be made.|$|E

500|$|Other {{curriculum}} topics chosen {{during the}} seminar included Arabic culture and heritage, school readiness, health and wellness, and female education. The seminar participants {{decided to use}} MSA, like the producers had done for the original show, citing an even greater need to expose children to the Arabic language. The National, for example, stated, [...] " [...] At a time when Arab children are increasingly deviating from their language and culture because of programming from nations like the United States and India, initiatives like <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>help</b> to reverse the trend". Abdulla Al Sharhan, the new show's creative director, agreed: [...] "We are losing our language, and so through Iftah Ya Simsim, we can revive the language {{in such a way}} that a child learns proper Arabic in a fun way". As with the original, outreach was an important part of the new show. Even before the show aired, four characters from the original toured the region, educating young children and their families about road and car safety. The cast and crew took a break from filming for a few months for [...] "constant live events" [...] to interact with their young viewers. Books, DVDs, CDs, online material and outreach programs for children, parents, and teachers were produced.|$|E
