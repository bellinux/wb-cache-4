The existence of futures contracts is very useful for financial managers {{for the absence of}} futures contracts, money managers will only have one trading location to change the portfolio's position at the time they receive new information which was expected to change the value of managed assets in cash market or spot market. In this study, the author took the hypothesis is assumed that the value of LQ 45 index futures in the period of this study is not fair (undervalued / overvalued). This study uses the period 2007 until the year 2009. Data analysis tools used {{to determine}} pricing futures and testing hypotheses is a pricing model that futures contracts do not provide income to the formula F 0 = S 0 erT. Theoretical futures price can be higher than the market price in cash (the premium) or lower than the market price in cash (at a discount. Futures pricing model is very influential on futures prices. Efficiency of stock index futures market occurred while the stock index futures prices fluctuated or the price level will adjust so that prices quickly reflect the new information form. Movement or change in price as a proof that the markets function well and get the information efficiently. Based on the results of research showing LQ 45 index futures prices are not reasonable (undervalued / overvalued) proves that occurred in the efficiency of stock index futures market because of movement / change in price. Based on data analysis using futures pricing model using <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>contract</b> does not provide income to show that the LQ 45 index futures prices from January 2007 to December 2009 there were 36 times the transaction (transactions monthly).

40|$|With the {{formation}} of European Monetary Union (EMU) in 1999, the eleven countries that adopted the Euro began to conduct a single monetary policy oriented towards union-wide objectives. The objective {{of this paper is}} to construct a small <b>model</b> of <b>the</b> Euro area, which may serve as a laboratory for evaluating the performance of alternative monetary policy strategies for the Euro area in the vein of recent studies for the United States. In estimating this model, we start with the relationship between output and inflation and investigate <b>the</b> nominal wage <b>contracting</b> <b>model</b> due to Taylor (1980) as well as three different versions of the relative real wage <b>contracting</b> <b>model</b> first proposed by Buiter and Jewitt (1981) and investigated empirically with U. S. data by Fuhrer and Moore (1995 a). Contrary to Fuhrer and Moore, who reject <b>the</b> nominal <b>contracting</b> <b>model</b> and prefer a version of <b>the</b> relative <b>contracting</b> <b>model</b> which induces a higher degree of inflation persistence, we find that both types of <b>contracting</b> <b>models</b> fit <b>the</b> data for the Euro area. The best fitting specification, however, is a version of <b>the</b> relative <b>contracting</b> <b>model,</b> which is theoretically more plausible than the simplified version preferred by Fuhrer and Moore. These findings are relevant to the continuing debate on sticky- inflation versus sticky-price models (for example Roberts (1997), Sbordone (1999), Gali and Gertler (1999) and Taylor (1999)) and may have important implications for the short-run inflation-output tradeoff faced by the Eurosystem. A drawback of the Euro area estimation is that the data are averages of the member economies, which experienced different monetary policy regimes prior to {{the formation}} of EMU. While Germany enjoyed stable inflation with fairly predictable monetary policy, countries such as France and Italy experienced a long-drawn out and probably imperfectly anticipated disinflation. To investigate the validity of our results, we also estimate <b>the</b> <b>contracting</b> <b>models</b> for France, Germany and Italy separately. We find that <b>the</b> relative <b>contracting</b> <b>model</b> dominates in countries which transitioned out of a high inflation regime such as France and Italy, while <b>the</b> nominal <b>contracting</b> <b>model</b> fits German data better. Thus, an optimist may conclude that the independent European Central Bank will face a similar environment in the future as the Bundesbank did in Germany and pick the nominal contracting specification, while a pessimist, who suspects that stabilizing Euro area inflation will require higher output losses, may want to pick the relative contracting specification. A robust monetary policy strategy, however, should perform reasonably well in both cases. We close <b>the</b> <b>model</b> by imposing a term-structure relationship and estimating an aggregate demand relationship. We then evaluate the performance of Taylor's rule as an example. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} choice between casual and regular labour contracts in Indian agriculture. In particular, it deals with two relevant decision problems: (i) how an employer chooses between casual and regular contracts and (ii) how a labourer chooses between casual and regular <b>contracts.</b> Several <b>models</b> of contractual choice are developed. In <b>the</b> implicit <b>contract</b> <b>model,</b> regular labour <b>contracts</b> are a means through which risk-neutral employers offer some insurance against the wage and employment fluctuations to labourers, in return for lower wages. In <b>the</b> shirking <b>model,</b> regular <b>contracts</b> are used to perform non-monitorable tasks for which casual contracts are not incentive compatible: regular contracts with wages above the reservation wage act as a device to induce the workers not to shirk in non-monitorable tasks. In <b>the</b> collateral <b>model,</b> regular <b>contracts</b> with advance wage payments provide labourers with a means of using their labour services as a collateral substitute. <b>The</b> time constraint <b>model</b> shows that landless labourers have a comparative advantage in regular labour contracts, because the opportunity cost of precommitting labour time tends to be lower for them. In each of these models, it is shown that casual and regular contracts may coexist in equilibrium. Empirical evidence bearing on these different theories is examined using data from three South Indian villages. The evidence is consistent with <b>the</b> implicit <b>contract</b> <b>model,</b> <b>the</b> collateral <b>model</b> and <b>the</b> time constraint <b>model.</b> However, we find no support for <b>the</b> shirking <b>model.</b> Other relevant aspects of labour contracts are also investigated, including labour force participation decisions, unemployment rates, the relative levels of casual-labour and regular-labour wages, the links between labour and credit contracts, and the determinants of labour demand. The thesis concludes {{with a discussion of}} recent trends in the incidence of casual and regular contracts in rural India. The incidence of regular contracts has steadily declined in recent years.
