The application was designed to allow viewers to participate in polls and learn trivial facts as they watch a live episode.

5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} that crossing the Void causes a traveller to become saturated in Void material. If {{he opens the}} breach and reverses it, anything saturated in Void material will be pulled in. Everyone except Jackie has crossed the breach and is thus vulnerable to being trapped in the Void, so the Doctor sends them all to the parallel universe. Rose decides she would rather be with the Doctor than her family and jumps back to help him. The Cybermen attempt to stop the Doctor but are repelled by a converted Ms. Hartman, who has resisted the effects of her conversion and at least partially retains her sense of self. The Doctor and Rose open the breach and hang on to magnetic clamps as the Cybermen and Daleks are pulled in. The Cult of Skaro use an emergency temporal shift to escape. Rose's lever slips, and in resetting it she loses her grip and plunges toward the Void. At the last second, Pete reappears and grabs her, and together they transport back to the parallel universe. The breach closes, leaving a devastated Rose trapped in the parallel universe. The devices used to travel between the two worlds have also stopped working. The Doctor presses his ear against the wall, as a tearful Rose does {{the same in the}} other universe, as if trying <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>for</b> each other.|$|E

25|$|The {{physical}} examination {{of an individual}} with aortic insufficiency involves auscultation of the heart <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>for</b> the murmur of aortic insufficiency and the S3 heart sound (S3 gallop correlates with development of LV dysfunction). The murmur of chronic aortic insufficiency is typically described as early diastolic and decrescendo, which is best heard in the third left intercostal space and may radiate along the left sternal border.|$|E
25|$|The {{crossing}} {{was made}} without incident until {{the morning of}} 1 August 1917, when fog appeared {{off the coast of}} Nova Scotia. The visibility was reduced to near zero, but Captain William McNeil continued on his course and posted several crew members <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>for</b> the various whistles like buoy bells or foghorn blasts, which warns ships of the dangerous shoals that threaten the entrance to Halifax Harbour.|$|E

25|$|Night patrols {{were left}} out in no man's land, after day patrols and longer reconnaissances, to keep watch in case of {{surprise}} attacks. The patrol would ride out, guided only by compass, to establish nighttime listening posts, where some dismounted to move close to Ottoman positions, <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>for</b> and note all movements. Others tested for water sources, examined Ottoman trenches and tracks in the area, or verified aerial reports. These night patrols consisted of one officer and 12 other ranks.|$|E
25|$|The {{captain of}} the Ollie K Wilds stated that the windows of his pilot house were closed, {{and that he did}} not hear the Frosta's horn. A {{previous}} accident involving the George Prince followed a similar scenario. On that occasion, the {{captain of the}} ferry stated that he did not hear the sounding of vehicle horns or the shouts of passengers. The morning of the accident, the windows were likely closed, and this may have prevented Auletta from hearing the Frosta's horn. Therefore, it is imperative that a lookout be designated and posted outside <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>for</b> and relay signals from other vessels.|$|E
25|$|With the {{knowledge}} he had gained from his studies in Paris, Copland came into demand as a lecturer and writer on contemporary European classical music. From 1927 to 1930 and 1935 to 1938, he taught classes at The New School of Social Research in New York City. Eventually, his New School lectures {{would appear in}} the form of two books—What <b>to</b> <b>Listen</b> <b>for</b> in Music (1937, revised 1957) and Our New Music (1940, revised 1968 and retitled The New Music: 1900–1960). During this period, Copland also wrote regularly for The New York Times, The Musical Quarterly {{and a number of other}} journals. These articles would appear in 1969 as the book Copland on Music.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, during his {{conducting}} stint in Saint Paul, Minnesota, McGlaughlin often {{spoke to the}} audience before a performance, informally explaining the program and what <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>for.</b> Garrison Keillor heard him, and invited McGlaughlin to fill in occasionally as host of his daily morning radio show on Minnesota Public Radio (MPR). MPR producer Tom Voegeli {{came up with the}} idea for a new show: Saint Paul Sunday Morning, with McGlaughlin as host. MPR had just received a public radio communications satellite uplink, as well as seed money to develop a few pilot shows for national distribution. Voegeli wanted a program which would present world-class musicians, in an informal live setting in MPR's new state-of-the-art studio, to a national audience. Voegeli also wanted McGlaughlin to sound like himself — a musician — rather than like a broadcaster, and to share his own intimate, animated enthusiasm with listeners.|$|E
25|$|Journalist and {{historian}} Peter Hennessy {{has made an}} assertion, {{in one of his}} books, that a test that the commander of a British nuclear-missile submarine must use to determine whether the UK has been the target of a nuclear attack (in which case he has sealed orders which may authorise him to fire his nuclear missiles in retaliation), is <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>for</b> the presence of Today on Radio 4's frequencies. If a certain number of days (said to be three) pass without the programme being broadcast, that is to be taken as evidence that the orders must be executed. The true conditions are of course secret, and Hennessy has never revealed his sources for this story, leading Paul Donovan, author of a book about Today, to express some scepticism about it. However, the longwave signal of Radio 4 is capable of penetrating to surface depths where submarines can rise, although it does not have the range required to be heard at this depth far from the UK's coastal waters.|$|E
500|$|The LFR {{navigation}} system required, at a minimum, only a simple AM radio receiver {{on board the}} aircraft to accurately navigate the airways under instrument meteorological conditions, and even execute an instrument approach to low minimums. On the downside, however, it had only four course directions per station, was sensitive to atmospheric {{and other types of}} interference and aberrations, and required pilots <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>for</b> hours to an annoying monotonous beep, or a faint stream of Morse codes, often embedded in background [...] "static". Its eventual replacement, the VHF band VOR {{navigation system}}, had many advantages. The VOR was virtually immune to interference, had 360 available course directions, had a visual [...] "on course" [...] display (with no listening needed), and was far easier to use. Consequently, when the VOR system became available in the early 1950s its acceptance was rapid, and within a decade the LFR was mostly phased out. VOR itself is gradually being phased out today in favor of the far superior Global Positioning System (GPS).|$|E
