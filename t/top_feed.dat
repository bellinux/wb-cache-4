5|$|Maunsell's Chief Locomotive Draughtsman, James Clayton, brought {{functional}} Midland Railway influences to the design, such as {{the shape}} of the cab and the drumhead-type smokebox, which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler. Clayton was also responsible for the tender and chimney designs. Snifting valves were provided to prevent vacuum formation in the cylinders when the locomotive was stationary, and the outside Walschaerts valve gear incorporated single slide-bars and piston tail rods. Innovations added by Maunsell's team included steam-powered locomotive brakes, locating the boiler water <b>top</b> <b>feed</b> inside a dome-like cover with external clackboxes and water feed pipes mounted on either side, and a new type of superheater that segregated saturated and superheated steam. Maunsell also incorporated a screw reverser to control valve events, which was easier to maintain than the complex steam reverser configuration of previous SECR designs. All components were standardised for interchange with similar locomotive classes to ease maintenance and reduce production costs.|$|E
25|$|All {{these changes}} (with the {{exception}} of the new <b>top</b> <b>feed)</b> were later applied to locomotives that had been built earlier. The new <b>top</b> <b>feed</b> became standard for new locomotives in 1944. Some older boilers and locomotives were later fitted with the new <b>top</b> <b>feed,</b> and some locomotives that were built with the new <b>top</b> <b>feed</b> were later changed back to the old design as boilers were swapped.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{live steam}} and exhaust steam {{injectors}} also assists in the pre-heating of boiler feedwater {{to a small}} degree, {{though there is no}} efficiency advantage to live steam injectors. Such pre-heating also reduces the thermal shock that a boiler might experience when cold water is introduced directly. This is further helped by the <b>top</b> <b>feed,</b> where water is introduced to the highest part of the boiler and made to trickle over a series of trays. G.J. Churchward fitted this arrangement to the high end of his domeless coned boilers. Other British lines such as the LBSCR fitted some locomotives with the <b>top</b> <b>feed</b> inside a separate dome forward of the main one.|$|E

The experiment comprised 8 goats crossbreed of White Goat and Brown Mountain Goat. These goats, which were on the second lactation, were divided into two groups – control (n = 4) and experimental (n = 4). The addition of 0. 1 [*]kg of basil green <b>tops</b> into goat <b>feeding</b> ration had no statistically significant effect on differences in total solid, fat or total nitrogen substances in milk during basil green <b>tops</b> <b>feeding.</b> However, the content of aroma active compounds (1 -octanol, 1 -undecanol, 2 -nonanone), which were obtained by simultaneous distillation-extraction (SDE) and determined with usage GC-MS, reached statistically significant differences in days of basil green <b>tops</b> <b>feeding.</b> The amount of 1 -octanol, 1 -undecanol and 2 -nonanone rose from 18. 24 ± 0. 019, 4. 48 ± 0. 019 and 5. 37 ± 0. 032 μl/ 100 [*]ml of milk in days without basil green <b>tops</b> in <b>feeding</b> ration to 24. 15 ± 10. 398, 9. 60 ± 0. 118 and 23. 29 ± 0. 408 μl/ 100 [*]ml of milk in the first day of basil green <b>tops</b> <b>feeding</b> when the increase was mostly the highest.

25|$|Prosopis cineraria is most {{important}} <b>top</b> <b>feed</b> species providing nutritious and highly palatable green as well as dry fodder, which is readily eaten by camels, cattle, sheep and goats, constituting a major feed requirement of desert livestock. Locally it is called Loong. Pods are locally called sangar or sangri. The dried pods locally called Kho-Kha are eaten. Dried pods also form rich animal feed, which is liked by all livestock. Green pods also form rich animal feed, which is liked by drying the young boiled pods. They are also used as famine food and known even to prehistoric man. Even the bark, having an astringent bitter taste, was reportedly eaten during the severe famine of 1899 and 1939. Pod yield is nearly 1.4 quintals of pods/ha with a variation of 10.7% in dry locations.|$|E
25|$|The first boilers {{suffered}} {{problems with}} the superheaters and with poor circulation for the tube rows in {{the centre of the}} bank, leading to overheating and tube failure. The circulation problems were addressed by re-arranging the feedwater pipes and by placing baffles inside the steam drum, so as to give a more clearly defined circulation. A circulation augmenter, a steel trough, was placed over the tops of the furnace-side tubes, encouraging a single central upwelling flow to above the water level, encouraging steam bubbles to escape and acting as a steam separator before the water re-circulated down the outer-side tubes. In a manner similar to work taking place around the same time on the LMS railway and the development of <b>top</b> <b>feed</b> for steam locomotives, the feedwater was also routed upwards through 'spray pots' and thus passed through the steam space as droplets. The cold feedwater was thus heated to the same temperature as the boiler water before mixing with it, avoiding disturbance to the circulation path.|$|E

50|$|Top-fed {{deep water}} {{culture is a}} {{technique}} involving delivering highly oxygenated nutrient solution direct to the root zone of plants. While deep water culture involves the plant roots hanging down into a reservoir of nutrient solution, in top-fed deep water culture the solution is pumped from the reservoir up to the roots (<b>top</b> <b>feeding).</b> The water is released over the plant's roots and then runs back into the reservoir below in a constantly recirculating system. As with deep water culture, there is an airstone in the reservoir that pumps air into the water via a hose from outside the reservoir. The airstone helps add oxygen to the water. Both the airstone and the water pump run 24 hours a day.|$|R

It was observed that the mixing time of the limiting nutrients varied significantly depending on both the direction of feeding and the impeller type. Since the profiles of the specific rates of CO 2 evolution, oxygen and glucose uptakes were very similar for the three culture modes, it could be reasonably assumed that the microorganism exhibited similar growth rates for each mode used. However, different amino acid producing activities were observed in the three culture modes. From these results it is concluded that the productivity of L-ornithine fermentation is significantly improved by shortening the mixing time of the limiting nutrient in the fermentor. ope...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} how {{the volume and}} temporal heterogeneity of water supply changed the vertical distribution and mortality of a belowground herbivore, and consequently affected plant biomass. Plantago lanceolata (Plantaginaceae) seedlings were grown at one per pot under different combinations of water volume (large or small volume) and heterogeneity (homogeneous water conditions, watered every day; heterogeneous conditions, watered every 4 days) in {{the presence or absence}} of a larva of the belowground herbivorous insect, Anomala cuprea (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae). The larva was confined in different vertical distributions to <b>top</b> <b>feeding</b> zone (<b>top</b> treatment), middle <b>feeding</b> zone (middle treatment), or bottom feeding zone (bottom treatment); alternatively no larva was introduced (control treatment) or larval movement was not confined (free treatment). Three-way interaction between water volume, heterogeneity, and the herbivore significantly affected plant biomass. With a large water volume, plant biomass was lower in free treatment than in control treatment regardless of heterogeneity. Plant biomass in free treatment was as low as in top treatment. With a small water volume and in free treatment, plant biomass was low (similar to that under top treatment) under homogeneous water conditions but high under heterogeneous ones (similar to that under middle or bottom treatment). Therefore, there was little effect of belowground herbivory on plant growth under heterogeneous water conditions.
