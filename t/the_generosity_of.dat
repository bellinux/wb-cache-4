5|$|Pain gave {{lands to}} Llanthony Priory, helping to {{establish}} the endowment of that monastic house, although {{it is difficult to}} distinguish his gifts from those of Hugh de Lacy, as the monks of Llanthony grouped the gifts of both men together in their records. In addition Pain granted lands to Gloucester Abbey, which had benefited from <b>the</b> <b>generosity</b> <b>of</b> his father and brother, as did his wife Sybil, together with other grants to her uncle the abbot. She also gave to two churches in Hereford: St Peter and St Guthlac.|$|E
5|$|The {{church has}} a nave with a north aisle and vestry, a Perpendicular Gothic west tower, a chancel and a south porch. The nave was rebuilt {{in the late}} 15th or early 16th century to meet a tower of {{approximately}} the same age; it is often dated to 1521, but appears to be built on older foundations. The southern side of the nave contains what are probably thirteenth-century buttresses {{and a pair of}} Perpendicular Gothic windows. The north aisle was originally built in the 13th century, and rebuilt by H.J. Underwood in 1890; the vestry was built in the 17th century and rebuilt in 1846 to designs by Chamberlain, through <b>the</b> <b>generosity</b> <b>of</b> the curate, Alexander Penrose Forbes. The church has been reroofed at least twice, in 1825 and 1897.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to clarify <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>generosity</b> applied to social {{security}} systems.

5|$|The {{remaining}} part of {{the south}} nave, the oldest section of the present structure, dates from medieval times; the north doorway and tracery (patterns of stonework in the windows) point to the 14th century. In about 1500, the church was enlarged {{by the addition of}} a south porch and a second nave to the north. An arcade (row of arches) was constructed between the two naves. Enlargement by adding a second nave was not as common in Anglesey as elsewhere in Wales. Llanidan is one of three examples on the island; the others are St Beuno's, Aberffraw and St Cwyfan's, Llangwyfan). It is uncertain whether St Nidan's was enlarged because of a growth in the numbers attending the church or because of <b>the</b> <b>generosity</b> <b>of</b> a benefactor.|$|E
5|$|Until 1996, the {{domestic}} situation during Unas' reign {{was thought to}} have been disastrous, based on reliefs from the causeway of his pyramid complex showing emaciated people and thus suggesting times of famine. This changed when excavations at Abusir in 1996 yielded similar reliefs in the mortuary complex of Sahure, who reigned at a prosperous time in the early Fifth Dynasty. In addition, research showed that the starving people are likely to be desert dwellers, nomads distinguished by their specific hair-style, rather than Egyptians. Thus, these reliefs are now understood to be standard representations of <b>the</b> <b>generosity</b> <b>of</b> the king towards the destitute and of the hardships of life in the desert regions bordering Egypt rather than referring to actual events.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I argue that {{foundational}} to attaining Cartesian generosity, {{both as a}} passion and as a virtue are the clear and distinct perceptions of mind, God, and body. I challenge Lisa Shapiro???s account <b>of</b> <b>generosity,</b> and her suggestion that <b>generosity</b> regulates <b>the</b> passions expressed in the meditations. Unlike Shapiro I attend closely to the distinction between <b>the</b> passion <b>of</b> <b>generosity</b> and <b>the</b> virtue <b>of</b> <b>generosity,</b> and how to acquire these different states of the soul. I propose that <b>the</b> passion <b>of</b> <b>generosity</b> cannot be aroused in the soul until after the meditations have been completed and the full inventory of clear and distinct perceptions attained. 1 interpret the meditations as orienting the meditator towards attaining virtue; by putting her {{in a position to}} attend frequently to the nature of free will after the six meditations have been completed. I interpret this frequent attendance to the will as a ???Seventh Meditation,??? which arouses <b>the</b> passion <b>of</b> <b>generosity.</b> After <b>the</b> passion has been attained, <b>the</b> virtue <b>of</b> <b>generosity</b> can then be acquired through self-cultivation, which instills generosity as a habit of the soul. <b>The</b> virtue <b>of</b> <b>generosity</b> is what allows one to gain mastery of the passions, and I provide an account of how this can be done through a process of reconditioning the passions...|$|R
