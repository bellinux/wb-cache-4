5|$|Harmon {{thought that}} Far Cry 4 was an {{improvement}} over Far Cry 3, but he <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game felt and played too similarly to Far Cry 3, and {{he added that the}} game was unambitious. Bertz thought that Ubisoft Montreal's vision for Far Cry 4 is not as bold as its predecessors, and also <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> experience delivered by Far Cry 4 did not stray far away from Far Cry 3. Tan also noted that the game's open world design felt not only similar to Far Cry 3, but also other Ubisoft franchises like Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs. Evans-Thirlwell <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> experience offered by Far Cry 4 was hollow as it had failed to innovate or reinvent its wheel. Dyer <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game was not ambitious, but the experience delivered was still gratifying and rewarding.|$|E
5|$|Konteradmiral Miklós Horthy, {{commander}} of the proposed attack, cancelled the attack because he <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Italians had discovered his plan and ordered the ships to return to Pola.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} content {{featured}} in the game received mixed reviews. Miller <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game only revolved around one idea, which led to its simplistic gameplay. Camron and Cooper <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> campaign was too short for most players. Shoemaker thought that for a full-priced game, it lacked content. Reiner furthered criticized the game's low replay value. Carter advocated that players purchase the game when its price dropped. He added that while the game features lots of ideas, most of them failed to deliver.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{multiplayer}} received mixed reviews. Prell <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mission-design was varied, and {{the voting}} system kept the mode from being repetitive. He also praised the interconnected structure between the single-player and multiplayer, {{noting that the}} items that could be carried over from multiplayer to campaign made the mode feel rewarding for players. Reiner <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> action featured in this mode is satisfying, but <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> system lacked enough depth and complexity to engage players. Patterson echoed similar thoughts, and felt that the ability of players to switch between the campaign and the Chaos Squad mode made the multiplayer mode a rewarding experience. Brown criticized the mode, saying that its difficulty was not properly scaled.|$|E
5|$|The game's setting {{received}} positive responses. Carter <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> verticality {{nature of}} the game's map created obstacles for players when they were traveling between places. However, he praised the interesting lore and wildlife found within the world, {{as well as the}} game's long draw distance. Harmon had similar comments, praising the game's graphics and Kyrat's culture. Harmon <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hilly landscape of the game's world gave players a sense of exploration, and hence made traversal enjoyable. Wilson thought, however, that the game's setting was not as compelling as the tropical setting of Far Cry 3. Nevertheless, she praised the Shangri-la section, which she thought had changed the game's landscape drastically. Matt Bertz from Game Informer praised the game's setting, which he thought was vibrant, varied and rich. Ludwig Kietzmann from Joystiq praised the content found within the world, and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> world itself was absorbing and interesting.|$|E
5|$|The lack of {{gameplay}} {{information was}} also criticized. Laura Parker found the trailer {{disconnected from the}} actual game, with the trailer being misleading by not showing any in-game information, and with the game failing to deliver the same emotional effect as the trailer. Daemon Hatfield from IGN similarly <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> trailer was not useful in assessing the game's quality and expressed concerns that the game {{would not be as}} entertaining and interesting as the trailer. Upon release, many reviewers <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> trailer had set expectation too high for the actual game, and that the game ended up not meeting expectations.|$|E

5|$|A common {{assumption}} in mammalogy is {{that small}} mammals cannot subsist entirely on plant material {{and must have}} a high-calorie diet in order to survive. As a result, it was <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> diet of tiny primates must be high in protein-containing insects (insectivory). Research has shown, however, that mouse lemurs, the smallest living primates, consume more fruit than insects, contradicting the popular hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|A grave found a short {{distance}} away also contained jewellery, including a gold pendant, silver brooch, and glass beads.

5|$|Although the Richard III Society {{remained}} {{interested in}} discussing the possible location of the king's grave, they did not search for his remains. Individual members suggested possible lines of investigation, but neither the University of Leicester nor local historians and archaeologists took up the challenge, probably because it was widely <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> grave site had been built over or the skeleton had been scattered, as John Speed's account suggested.|$|E
5|$|Among {{women living}} closely together, {{it was once}} <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> onsets of {{menstruation}} tend to synchronize. This effect was first described in 1971, and possibly explained {{by the action of}} pheromones in 1998. Subsequent research has called this hypothesis into question.|$|E
5|$|Captain John Saris {{may have}} brought back {{examples}} of toy spaniels from his voyage to Japan in 1613, a theory proposed by Commodore Matthew C. Perry during his expeditions to Japan {{on behalf of}} the United States in the mid-19th century. He noted that dogs were a common gift and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> earlier voyage of Captain Saris introduced a Japanese type of spaniel into England.|$|E

5|$|Chemists {{who studied}} {{platinum}} dissolved it in aqua regia (a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids) to create soluble salts. They always observed {{a small amount}} of a dark, insoluble residue. Joseph Louis Proust <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> residue was graphite. The French chemists Victor Collet-Descotils, Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy, and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin also observed the black residue in 1803, but did not obtain enough for further experiments.|$|E
5|$|Deodato said he {{conceived}} {{of the film}} while talking to his son about {{news coverage of the}} terrorism of the Red Brigades. Deodato <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> media focused on portraying violence with little regard for journalistic integrity and believed that the media staged certain news angles in order to obtain more sensational footage. He reflected this behavior in the film team in Cannibal Holocaust, whom he said symbolized the Italian media.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the overall}} {{positive}} reception, some reviewers <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game {{had too many}} redundancies in the cases and left too little control to the player, leading to the game being boring at times. Although 1UP gave it a perfect score, they also warned that the extended cut-scenes in the game could make some players feel they {{lost control of the}} action.|$|E

5|$|During {{the twentieth}} century the Doom Bar was {{regularly}} dredged to improve access to Padstow. By the 1930s, when Commander H.E. Turner surveyed the estuary, there were two channels round the Doom Bar, and it is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> main channel may have moved to the east side in 1929. By 2010 the original channel had disappeared. The estuary is regularly dredged by Padstow Harbour Commission's dredgers, Sandsnipe and Mannin.|$|E
5|$|Early European explorers in North America, {{who were}} {{familiar}} with the smaller red deer of Europe, <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> larger North American animal resembled a moose, and consequently gave it the name elk, which is the common European name for moose. The word elk is related to the Latin alces, Old Norse elgr, Scandinavian elg/älg and German Elch, all of which refer to the animal known in North America as the moose.|$|E
5|$|Eurogamer {{noted the}} {{annoyance}} {{of returning to}} defend over 20 towns each with recurring zombie problems, but said that the game mechanic is never too bothersome and even appreciated its element of time management, {{similar to that of}} the Dead Rising game series. IGN <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lack of fast travel was an impediment. Reviewers also noted technical issues with moving Marston's character, especially when climbing ladders and outrunning zombies.|$|E
