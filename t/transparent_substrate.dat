2500|$|There are {{typically}} {{two different ways}} of mathematically describing how an electromagnetic wave interacts with the elements within an ellipsometer (including the sample): the Jones matrix and the Mueller matrix formalisms. In the Jones matrix formalism, the electromagnetic wave is described by a Jones vector with two orthogonal complex-valued entries for the electric field (typically [...] and [...] ), and the effect that an optical element (or sample) has on it is described by the complex-valued 2x2 Jones matrix. [...] In the Mueller matrix formalism, the electromagnetic wave is described by Stokes vectors with four real-valued entries, and their transformation is described by the real-valued 4x4 Mueller matrix. When no depolarization occurs both formalisms are fully consistent. Therefore, for non-depolarizing samples, the simpler Jones matrix formalism is sufficient. If the sample is depolarizing the Mueller matrix formalism should be used, because it also give the amount of depolarization. Reasons for depolarization are, for instance, thickness non-uniformity or backside-reflections from a <b>transparent</b> <b>substrate.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The LED {{filament}} {{is composed}} {{of a series of}} LEDs on a <b>transparent</b> <b>substrate,</b> referred to as Chip-On-Glass (COG). These transparent substrates are made of glass or sapphire materials. This transparency allows the emitted light to disperse evenly and uniformly without any interference. An even coating of yellow phosphor in a silicone resin binder material converts the blue light generated by the LEDs into white light. Degradation of silicone binder, and leakage of blue light are design issues in LED filament lights. Positive benefits of the LED design are potential higher efficiencies by the use of more LED emitters from lower driving currents. A major benefit of the design is the ease with which near full [...] "global" [...] illumination can be obtained from arrays of filaments.|$|E
50|$|Scratches, abrasions, cinch marks {{caused by}} {{rewinding}} a film too tightly, and other blemishes {{are a common}} problem with films that are candidates for restoration. Most of these scratches are in {{the back side of}} the film in the <b>transparent</b> <b>substrate</b> that forms the film base, rather than in the photographic emulsion on the front that holds the film's actual image. In the normal process of duplicating a film in an optical printer, collimated light passes through the film base on its way to illuminate the emulsion. Any scratches, abrasions, etc., in the film base cause the light to bend such that the duplicated film ends up with bright or dark (depending on whether copying from a negative or positive original) copies of the scratches. This bending of the light is being caused by the difference in the refraction index of the substrate and the air.|$|E
