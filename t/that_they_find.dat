5|$|It is Thanksgiving and Lisa assembles a {{decorative}} centerpiece for the dinner table. Meanwhile, Homer leaves {{to pick up}} Grampa from the retirement home once Patty and Selma arrive, bearing food (Swedish meatballs), and to Marge's consternation they insinuate <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>find</b> Marge's turkeys are dry and inedible. Their mother Jaqueline Bouvier arrives in a taxi, suffering from laryngitis, and tells Marge she never does anything right.|$|E
5|$|The Internet {{has helped}} autistic {{individuals}} bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>find</b> {{so hard to}} deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely. Sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that autism is simply another way of being.|$|E
5|$|After {{embarking on}} a small tour, the band set about {{recording}} Brave New World, their first studio album with Dickinson since 1992. Dickinson insisted <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>find</b> a replacement for the now retired Martin Birch, the band's regular producer, and record in a different studio {{than the one in}} which they made No Prayer for the Dying and Fear of the Dark, to which Harris agreed. The album was recorded at Guillaume Tell Studios, Paris with producer Kevin Shirley, after which Iron Maiden undertook a supporting tour culminating with a performance at the Rock in Rio festival before a crowd of 250,000.|$|E

5|$|Most {{scholars}} on the stronger-sacramental end of {{the spectrum}} assess the sacraments as being of great importance to the evangelist. However, perhaps counterintuitively, some scholars who find fewer sacramental references, such as Udo Schnelle, view the references <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>find</b> as highly important as well. Schnelle in particular views John's sacramentalism as a counter to Docetist anti-sacramentalism. On the other hand, though he agrees that there are anti-Docetic passages, James Dunn views the absence of a Eucharistic institution narrative as evidence for an anti-sacramentalism in John, meant to warn against a conception of eternal life as dependent on physical ritual.|$|E
5|$|SCI {{can lead}} to {{significant}} insecurities, which have repercussions for sexuality and self-image. SCI often affects body image, either due to the host {{of changes in the}} body that affect appearance (e.g. unused muscles in the legs become atrophied), or due to changes in self-perception not directly from physical changes. People frequently find themselves less attractive and expect others not to be attracted to them after SCI. These insecurities cause fear of rejection and deter people from initiating contact or sexual activity or engaging in sex. Feelings of undesirability or worthlessness even lead some to suggest to their partners <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>find</b> someone able bodied.|$|E
5|$|Simakis {{praised the}} book for having more depth of {{character}} than Grisham's novels customarily do. She compares the protagonist to Mitch McDeere from The Firm and Rudy Baylor from The Rainmaker. Memmott says {{that most of the}} claimants <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>find</b> are unsympathetic, but a few are from somewhat sympathetic immigrant families. Simakis notes that Wally trades sex for legal services with one claimant. Harshaw says that the book is a bit sentimental and comparatively lacking in terms of secondary character development for Grisham. Larry Orenstein of Canada's Globe and Mail notes that on the dramatic scale this book has instances of laugh out loud humor that make it more like Boston Legal than The Practice, which Boston Legal was spun off from.|$|E

5|$|The diet of {{the bird}} can be varied. They eat various forms of foliage and other grassy {{material}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>find</b> on the ground on in trees and shrubs. Dusky woodswallows have been seen eating termites, butterflies and other insects. They also eat nectar from flowers. One notable aspect of their feeding habits {{is the way they}} hunt flying insects, which is done by picking them up on their wing. They do, however, also eat their prey from the ground, and they often find inconspicuous places to perch while waiting for prey, such as utility lines and the like. They have also been observed engaging in kleptoparasitism, working as a group to rob a restless flycatcher of its prey. Kleptoparasitism is extremely unusual in passerine birds, as is cooperative kleptoparasitsim in general.|$|E
5|$|After Trespass was recorded, {{ill health}} and {{developing}} stage fright caused Phillips to leave Genesis. His last show {{with the band}} took place in Haywards Heath on 18 July 1970. He felt the increased number of gigs affected the group's creativity and that several songs he wrote were not recorded or performed live. He had contracted bronchial pneumonia and became isolated {{from the rest of}} the band, feeling that it had too many songwriters in it. Banks, Gabriel, and Rutherford saw Phillips as an important member, being the most instrumental in encouraging them to turn professional. They regarded his exit as the band's greatest threat and the most difficult to overcome. Gabriel and Rutherford decided they would continue; Banks agreed on the condition <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>find</b> a new drummer that was of equal stature to the rest of the group. Mayhew was therefore fired, though Phillips later thought Mayhew's working-class background clashed with the rest of the band which affected his confidence.|$|E

25|$|Belarus has had {{an ongoing}} {{discussion}} to relaunch IMF-backed reforms, concluding an arrangement for an IMF Staff-monitored program (SMP) in 2001. However, the authorities did not follow through with reforms as hoped, leaving an uncertain future for IMF-backed cooperation. Belarus authorities have said on several occasions <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>find</b> IMF intervention and recommendations in Belarus counter-productive to the economic development of those countries.|$|E

25|$|Borzois can {{be raised}} very {{successfully}} to live with cats and other small animals provided they are introduced {{to them when they}} are puppies. Some, however, will possess the hunting instinct to such a degree <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>find</b> it impossible not to chase a cat that is moving quickly. The hunting instinct is triggered by movement and much depends on how the cat behaves.|$|E

Following a show's cancellation, CDE executive Veronica gives the Muppets a recently vacated two-hour {{slot in the}} network's schedule, on the condition <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>find</b> a celebrity guest. The Muppets refurbish the theater, but their first rehearsal is unsuccessful and Kermit is unable to contact a celebrity guest. Piggy returns, forces Poogy out, and informs Kermit that she refuses to work with him. Kermit inspires Walter to find his talent and perform in the telethon. Meanwhile, Mary goes sightseeing alone.|$|E
25|$|The Censorship of Publications Board is an {{independent}} board established by the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929 to examine books and periodicals that are {{for sale in the}} Republic of Ireland. It is governed by the Censorship of Publications Acts of 1929, 1946 and 1967. The Board has the authority to prohibit any book or periodical <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>find</b> to be obscene. This makes it illegal to buy, sell or distribute that publication in the Republic of Ireland. The Board prohibited a large number of publications in the past, including books by respected authors. However, since the 1990s it does not prohibit publications very often.|$|E

25|$|Many {{refugees}} from North Korea have complained <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>find</b> integration into South Korean society to be difficult; {{they say they}} often face social ostracism and a government that would rather they keep quiet about the human rights situation in the North. The government has taken major steps to minimize the impact the refugees might have on its policy towards the North. An Internet radio station operated by refugees, broadcasting for those living in the North, was subject to a campaign of harassment that ended in it being unable to afford its rent after less than one month of operation. The station accused the government of either being behind the campaign or tacitly encouraging it. The government also blocked activists from sending radios to the North, and a scuffle reportedly left activist Norbert Vollertsen injured.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{members of}} the free {{software}} community maintain the vision that all software {{is a part of}} freedom of speech and that proprietary software is unethical and unjust. The free software movement openly champions this belief through talks that denounce proprietary software. As a whole the community refuses to support proprietary software. Further there are external motivations for these developers. One motivation is that, when a programmer fixes a bug or makes a program it benefits others in an open source environment. Another motivation is that a programmer can work on multiple projects <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>find</b> interesting and enjoyable. Programming in the open source world can also lead to commercial job offers or entrance into the venture capital community. These are just a few reasons why open source programmers continue to create and advance software.|$|E
25|$|When on {{foraging}} trips, kangaroo rats hoard {{the seeds}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>find.</b> It {{is important for}} a kangaroo rat to encounter more food items than are consumed, at least {{at one point in}} the year, as well as defend or rediscover food caches and remain within the same areas long enough to utilize food resources. Different species of kangaroo rat may have different seed caching strategies to coexist with each other, as is the case for the banner-tailed kangaroo rat and Merriam's kangaroo rat which have overlapping ranges. Merriam's kangaroo rats scatterhoard small caches of seeds in numerous small, shallow holes they dig. This is initially done close to the food source, maximizing harvest rates and reducing travel costs, but later redistributed more widely, minimizing theft by other rodents. Banner-tailed kangaroo rats larderhoard a sizable cache of seeds within the large mounds they occupy. This could decrease their time and energy expenses; they also spend less time on the surface digging holes, reducing risk of predation. Being larger and more sedentary, they are better able to defend these larders from depredations by other rodents.|$|E
