5|$|NuScale {{designs and}} markets small modular nuclear {{reactors}} that the Department of Energy {{expects to be}} commercially available around 2025. Its designs use the light water approach to cooling and power generation that is common in conventional nuclear plants. Water is heated by the nuclear core {{at the base of}} the reactor vessel. Heated water flows upwards inside <b>the</b> <b>riser,</b> then down over steam generators. As heat is transferred to steam generators, the water becomes cooler and denser, sinking back to the bottom of the device, where the cycle is repeated. Heat transferred to the steam generators is used to create steam that turns a turbine, which drives an electrical generator.|$|E

While Robinson liked the idea, he quickly realized that he could not teach his complex stair dance to a seven-year-old in the few days permitted by the shooting schedule. Instead, he taught Temple to kick <b>the</b> <b>riser</b> (face) of each stairstep with her toe. After watching her practice his choreography, Robinson modified his routine to mimic her movements, so that it appeared on film that she was imitating his steps.

This pellet/wire combination is subsequently vacuum sintered at high temperature (typically 1200 to 1800°C) which produces a mechanically strong pellet and drives off many impurities within the powder.

This structure is of predictable mechanical strength and density, but is also highly porous, producing a large internal surface area (see Figure 2).|$|E

Several solids, ranging in size from 48 -mu-m to 300 -mu-m and ranging in density from 1 330 kg m- 3 to 2 600 kg m- 3, were tested.

40|$|The {{presence}} of seawater {{in a sea}} outfall can reduce the effluent discharge from a land-based treatment plant or domestic and industrial areas. In the longterm, it can damage the sea outfall. To avoid the {{presence of}} seawater and to anticipate a varying effluent discharge, a minimum effluent discharge is needed to purge the outfall system. [...] The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate various ways of decreasing the minimum effluent discharge needed to purge a sea outfall. The effect of port size and an increase in mixing between saltwater and effluent are considered in this study. In tests on the effect of port size, three different types of tests were undertaken. There included risers without caps, risers with caps having one port of diameter 2. 54 cm (one inch), and risers with caps having two ports of diameter 2. 54 cm (one inch). Attempts were made to increase mixing in <b>the</b> vertical <b>risers</b> using small water jets located below <b>the</b> <b>risers,</b> water jets located upstream of <b>the</b> <b>risers,</b> air jets located below <b>the</b> <b>risers</b> and a barrier located at the top of tunnel upstream <b>the</b> <b>risers.</b> [...] <b>The</b> maximum reduction in the purging discharge was obtained using water jets (1. 001 /min) located below all <b>risers.</b> <b>The</b> purging discharge using these jets was only 48 % of that without water jets.

2500|$|The {{bottom part}} of the reactor is {{enclosed}} in a watertight compartment. There is a space between the reactor bottom and the floor. The reactor cavity overpressure protection system consists of steam relief assemblies embedded in the floor and leading to Steam Distributor Headers covered with rupture discs and opening into the Steam Distribution Corridor below the reactor, on level +6. The floor of the corridor contains entrances {{of a large number}} of vertical pipes, leading to the bottoms of the Pressure Suppression Pools ("bubbler" [...] pools) located on levels +3 and +0. In the event of an accident, which was predicted to be at most a rupture of one or two pressure channels, the steam was to be bubbled through the water and condensed there, reducing the overpressure in the leaktight compartment. The flow capacity of the pipes to the pools limited the protection capacity to simultaneous rupture of two pressure channels; a higher number of failures would cause pressure buildup sufficient to lift the cover plate ("Structure E", after the explosion nicknamed [...] "Elena"), sever the rest of the fuel channels, destroy the control rod insertion system, and potentially also withdraw control rods from the core. The containment was designed to handle failures of the downcomers, pumps, and distribution and inlet of the feedwater. The leaktight compartments around the pumps can withstand overpressure of 0.45MPa. The distribution headers and inlets enclosures can handle 0.08MPa and are vented via check valves to the leaktight compartment. The reactor cavity can handle overpressure of 0.18MPa and is vented via check valves to the leaktight compartment. The pressure suppression system can handle a failure of one reactor channel, a pump pressure header, or a distribution header. Leaks in the steam piping and separators are not handled, except for maintaining slightly lower pressure in <b>the</b> <b>riser</b> pipe gallery and the steam drum compartment than in the reactor hall. These spaces are also not designed to withstand overpressure. The steam distribution corridor contains surface condensers. The fire sprinkler systems, operating during both accident and normal operation, are fed from the pressure suppression pools through heat exchangers cooled by the plant service water, and cool the air above the pools. Jet coolers are located in the topmost parts of the compartments; their role is to cool the air and remove the steam and radioactive aerosol particles.|$|E

50|$|Main parachutes used by skydivers {{today are}} {{designed}} to open softly. Overly rapid deployment was an early problem with ram-air designs. The primary innovation that slows the deployment of a ram-air canopy is the slider; a small rectangular piece of fabric with a grommet near each corner. Four collections of lines go through the grommets to <b>the</b> <b>risers</b> (risers are strips of webbing joining the harness and the rigging lines of a parachute). During deployment, the slider slides down from the canopy to just above <b>the</b> <b>risers.</b> <b>The</b> slider is slowed by air resistance as it descends and reduces {{the rate at which}} the lines can spread.

40|$|Safety {{investigations}} {{were performed}} on 600 - and 1426 -MW(thermal) liquid-metal-cooled reactors with the heat exchangers (HXs) located in <b>the</b> <b>risers</b> of simple flow-path pool designs. This includes both critical reactors and accelerator-driven systems (ADSs) using liquid metal coolants. For the 600 -MW(thermal) ADS, the safety implications were examined for vessel sizes of two heights (11 and 15 m) and two diameters (6 and 10 m). Then, the reference design of 11 -m height and 6 -m diameter was compared with a similar design, but with the HXs located in the downcomers. The transients investigated were total-loss of-power (TLOP), unprotected-loss-of-flow (ULOF), protected-loss-of-flow, and unprotected loss-of-heat-sink accidents. The 600 -MW(thermal) ADS of 11 -m height and 6 -m diameter peaks at 1041 K after 29 h during a TLOP accident. If the diameter is increased to 10 m, it will peak after 55 h at a 178 K lower temperature thanks to its larger thermal inertia. The difference between locating the HXs in <b>the</b> <b>risers</b> and <b>the</b> downcomers is insignificant for this accident type. With the HXs in <b>the</b> <b>risers,</b> <b>the</b> temperature peaks at 1045 K after 28 h. During a ULOF accident in an ADS at full power, the core outlet temperature stabilizes at 1010 K, which is 337 K above the nominal outlet temperature. When the vessel height is increased to 15 m, the natural convection is improved, and the core outlet temperature stabilizes at 911 K. A Pb-cooled 1426 -MW(thermal) reactor of 11 -m height and 12 -m diameter is also shown to be sufficiently coolable during a TLOP accident; i. e., it peaks at 1093 K after 49 h. In a pool-type design with a simple flow path, the use of HXs in <b>the</b> <b>risers</b> and flaps at their inlets that prevent a flow reversal will have significant safety advantages in case of HX tube failures. Steam or gas bubbles exiting from the secondary circuit cannot be dragged into the core region by the liquid-metal coolant. Instead, they would rise with the coolant and exit through the free surface. Another important effect from placing the HXs in <b>the</b> <b>risers</b> is <b>the</b> fact that the reactor vessel wall will be cooler during normal operation and during all accidents in which the HXs still operate. This is because the coolant passes through the HXs before it reaches the vessel wall. The idea to place the HXs in <b>the</b> <b>risers</b> of a simple flow-path design is protected by European patent No. 04 103 634. 4.
