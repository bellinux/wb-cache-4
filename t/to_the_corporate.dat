5|$|RKO, and {{the movie}} {{industry}} as a whole, had its most profitable year ever in 1946. A Goldwyn production released by RKO, The Best Years of Our Lives, was the most successful Hollywood film of the decade. But {{the legal status of}} the industry's reigning business model was increasingly being called into doubt: the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Bigelow v. RKO that the company was liable for damages under antitrust statutes for having denied an independent movie house access to first run films—a common practice among all of the Big Five. With profits at a high point, Floyd Odlum cashed in by selling off about 40% of his shares in the company to a group of investment firms. After Koerner's death, Radio-Keith-Orpheum president N. Peter Rathvon and RKO Radio Pictures president Ned Depinet had exchanged positions, with Depinet moving <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> offices in New York and Rathvon relocating to Hollywood and doubling as production chief while a permanent replacement was sought for Koerner. On the first day of 1947, producer and Oscar-winning screenwriter Dore Schary, who had been working at the studio on loan from Selznick, took over the role.|$|E

25|$|The reorganizing {{also made}} a drastic change <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> culture. While ND {{previously}} had allowed {{a high degree of}} autonomy for its employees and divisions, issues became increasingly top-managed. Motivation and sales dropped, and the company lost much of its ability to get employees to work free overtime. In early 1991 a new round of layoffs was carried through, followed by a new reorganization. New control mechanisms were introduced to ensure that all employees understood the new model. Few employees would admit to not understanding it, but in reality most did not, enhancing the problem. New rounds of lay-offs took place in June and September, the latter consisting of 500 people. ND lost all its large customers and signed no large contracts in 1990 and 1991. One of the main reasons was that sales personnel were forced to call back to the office to confirm every step in negotiations.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{publishing}} academic {{journals and}} textbooks {{is a large}} part of an international industry. Critics claim that standardised accounting and profit-oriented policies have displaced the publishing ideal of providing access to all. In contrast to the commercial model, there is non-profit publishing, where the publishing organization is either organised specifically for the purpose of publishing, such as a university press, or is one of the functions of an organisation such as a medical charity, founded to achieve specific practical goals. An alternative approach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> model is open access, the online distribution of individual articles and academic journals without charge to readers and libraries. The pioneers of Open Access journals are BioMed Central and the Public Library of Science (PLoS). Many commercial publishers are experimenting with hybrid models where certain articles or government funded articles are made free due to authors' payment of processing charges, and other articles are available as part of a subscription or individual article purchase.|$|E

25|$|Gray Davis critics often {{charge that}} he did not respond {{properly}} to the crisis, while his defenders attribute the crisis solely <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> accounting scandals and say that Davis did all he could. Some critics on the left, such as Arianna Huffington, alleged that Davis was lulled to inaction by campaign contributions from energy producers. Some of Davis' energy advisers were formerly employed by the same energy speculators who made millions from the crisis. In addition, the Democratic-controlled legislature would sometimes push Davis to act decisively by taking over power plants which were known to have been gamed and place them back under control of the utilities. Some conservatives argued that Davis signed overpriced energy contracts, employed incompetent negotiators and refused to allow prices to rise for residences statewide much like they did in San Diego, which they argue could have given Davis more leverage against the energy traders and encouraged more conservation. The electricity crisis {{is considered one of the}} major factors that led to Davis' recall.|$|E
25|$|In {{exchange}} for US $43 billion in liquidity aid, Suharto {{was forced to}} sign three letters of intent from October 1997 to April 1998 with the IMF. The LoI promised reforms which includes closing banks owned by Suharto's family and cronies starting in November 1997. Plan to close unhealthy banks resulted in a bank run that drained liquidity; depositors knew of the poor regulations and risky related-party credit extensions of Indonesian banks. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantee for bank deposits, and set-up Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency to take-over management of troubled banks to prevent collapse of the financial system. Based on IMF recommendation, the government increased interest rates to 70% pa in February 1998 to control spiralling inflation caused by higher price of imports, but this action killed availability of credit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> sector. Suharto's foot-dragging in undertaking reforms demanded by IMF in relation to his children's business further weakened public confidence. According to American economist Steve Hanke, invited by Suharto in February 1998 to plan currency board system, President Bill Clinton and IMF managing director Michel Camdessus deliberately worsened the Indonesian crisis to force Suharto to resign.|$|E

Further, this study aims <b>to</b> explore how <b>the</b> personal brand of a leader can contribute <b>to</b> shape <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> brand from an internal perspective, in aspects such as organisational culture and visions. This study focuses mainly on the positive aspects of the personal brand since we are more interested <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> positive outcomes of personal branding than the negative ones.   Target Group                   Our study is directed towards a target audience of Swedish leaders and other interested parties that want <b>to</b> increase <b>the</b> understanding for personal and corporate branding, and <b>to</b> increase <b>the</b> understanding of how leaders can use <b>the</b> personal brand <b>to</b> shape <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> brand. Theoretical framework    We have mainly focused on two different theories; one for personal branding and one for corporate branding. Methodology                   This study is based on a qualitative, deductive approach, with a case strategy. The empirical data is collected through personal interviews. Result                              We have come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion {{that the most important thing}} to be able <b>to</b> shape <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> brand is <b>to</b> align your vision and values with the vision of <b>the</b> company. <b>To</b> be able to use your personal brand, you need to know who you are and what you hold to be true. We have also come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that in what extent the leader can use <b>the</b> personal brand <b>to</b> shape <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> brand will be dependent of different positions and different companies. However, we believe that leaders within every sector have more or less ability to use their personal brand <b>to</b> shape <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> brand...|$|R
