5|$|Mrs. Tittlemouse is a <b>tale</b> <b>in</b> {{which no}} humans {{play a part}} and one in which events are treated as though they have {{occurred}} since time immemorial and far from human observance. It is a simple story, and one likely to appeal to young children.|$|E
5|$|In December 1903 Mark Twain, {{who opposed}} vivisection, {{published}} a short story, A Dog's <b>Tale,</b> <b>in</b> Harper's, written {{from the point}} of view of a dog whose puppy is experimented on and killed. Given the timing and Twain's views, the story may have been inspired by the libel trial, according to Mark Twain scholar Shelley Fisher Fishkin. Coleridge ordered 3,000 copies of A Dog's Tale, which were specially printed for him by Harper's.|$|E

5|$|Love, sex {{and desire}} become {{important}} elements of the plot in Sant Singh Sekhon's Punjabi play Kalakar (1945), which places the epic drama in the modern age. It depicts Ahalya as a free-spirited woman, who dares to be painted nude by Inder (Indra), a pupil of the art professor, Gautama, and defends her decision against her husband's criticisms. N. S. Madhavan's Malayalam story (April 2006) also retells Ahalya's <b>tale</b> <b>in</b> a modern setting, wherein Ahalya, accused of adultery, is beaten by her husband, leaving her in a coma from which the neurologist, Rama, revives her. The 2015 film Ahalya gives a feminist twist to the tale where the policeman Indra turns into a stone doll, after visiting Ahalya. The tale was also parodied in the Telugu film Attarintiki Daredi. However, the practice of retelling the classical Ahalya–Indra <b>tale</b> <b>in</b> a contemporary setting is not new. The Yoga Vasistha (1001–1400) narrates {{a tale of two}} adulterous lovers, Queen Ahalya and the Brahmin Indra. Here, Ahalya and Indra fall in love and continue their affair, despite being punished by Ahalya's jealous husband. After death, they reunite in their next birth.|$|E

5|$|In the 12th century, French trouvère (troubadour) Chrétien de Troyes, adapted many of {{the myths}} recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses into Old French. However, de Troyes {{was not alone in}} making use of Ovid's material. Geoffrey Chaucer recounted the story in his {{unfinished}} work The Legend of Good Women and briefly alluded to the myth in his Troilus and Criseyde. John Gower included the <b>tale</b> <b>in</b> his Confessio Amantis. References to Philomela are common in the motets of the ars nova, ars subtilior, and ars mutandi musical eras of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries.|$|E

5|$|The {{colonialism}} that Atangana {{had supported}} was ruinous in Cameroon. Production centred on enriching the chiefs, wooing of foreign investment, and the apparatus of colonial administration, and building only that infrastructure that would {{aid in the}} transport and export of cash crops. Nevertheless, Atangana's story became part of Beti folklore. For example, Beti storytellers related his <b>tale</b> <b>in</b> oral poems and songs that took up to a full night to recite. His legacy was largely forgotten by the nation at large between his death and Cameroonian independence. However, the nationalist scholarship that blossomed after Cameroon's independence in 1960 resurrected his story. Charles Atangana Avenue in downtown Yaoundé is named for him. A statue in his likeness tops a hill nearby, which had fallen into disrepair by 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{sinking of}} Vengeur du Peuple {{was used as}} {{propaganda}} by the National Convention and Bertrand Barère, who {{gave birth to the}} legend that the crew had gone down with the ship fighting, rather than surrender.

Although discredited in naval history circles, the legend lived on as a folk tale, inspiring numerous representations and a fictional account by Jules Verne in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} the three bears was in {{circulation}} before the publication of Southey's <b>tale.</b> <b>In</b> 1813, for example, Southey was telling the story to friends, and in 1831 Eleanor Mure fashioned a handmade booklet about the three bears and the old woman for her nephew Horace Broke's birthday. Southey and Mure differ in details. Southey's bears have porridge, but Mure's have milk; Southey's old woman has no motive for entering the house, but Mure's old woman is piqued when her courtesy visit is rebuffed; Southey's old woman runs away when discovered, but Mure's old woman is impaled on the steeple of St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|Tolkien {{at first}} {{intended}} The Lord of the Rings to be a children's <b>tale</b> <b>in</b> {{the style of}} The Hobbit, but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing. Though a direct sequel to The Hobbit, it addressed an older audience, drawing on the immense backstory of Beleriand that Tolkien had constructed in previous years, and which eventually saw posthumous publication in The Silmarillion and other volumes. Tolkien's influence weighs heavily on the fantasy genre that grew up after the success of The Lord of the Rings.|$|E
5|$|A {{description}} of Kubera's magnificent court {{appears in the}} Mahabharata {{as well as the}} Meghaduta. Here, Gandharvas and Apsaras entertain Kubera. Shiva and his wife Parvati often frequent Kubera's court, which is attended by semi-divine beings like the Vidyadharas; Kimpurushas; Rakshasas; Pishachas; as well as Padma and Shankha; personified treasures (nidhi); and Manibhadra, Kubera's chief attendant and chief of his army. Like every world-protector, Kubera has seven seers of the North in residence. Alaka is recorded to be plundered by Ravana once, and attacked by the Pandava prince, Bhima once. Kubera's Nairrata army is described to have defeated king Mucukunda, who then defeated them by the advice of his guru Vashishta. Shukra, the preceptor of the demons, is also recorded to have defeated Kubera and stolen his wealth. Another major <b>tale</b> <b>in</b> the scriptures records how Kubera entertained the sage Ashtavakra in his palace.|$|E

5|$|At {{the village}} of Kusić in Banat, a man named Ilija Bordan was {{regarded}} to be alovit; the villagers talked {{that he had a}} tail. Whenever a thunderstorm came, his appearance changed—he fought with an ala. If the ala was overwhelming him, Ilija would lie down and sleep, and if he was overpowering her, the clouds would start to dissipate. There was a <b>tale</b> <b>in</b> the same village about an alovit man who would warn the villagers of the approach of a thunderstorm, before he took a wagon pole on his back and flew into the clouds. At {{the village of}} Sokolovac in Banat, people told of an alovit man who had four nipples. At the sight of hail clouds, he would mount his mare and disappear for several days. The latter two men would come back tired, bruised, and with torn clothes. As held in the central Serbian region of Gruža, men could become dragonlike. As such, they would suddenly disappear during thunderstorms, and fly into the dark clouds to fight against ale. They were characterized as nimble, hot-tempered, rash and very strong. At a village near Radomir in western Bulgaria, there was a dragon man who was said to have been physically crippled by an ala.|$|E
5|$|During the Tests, Toshack took 11 wickets at 33.09; {{his most}} notable {{performance}} was his 5/40 {{in the second}} innings of the Second Test at Lord's. Of the four frontline pacemen, Toshack had the second best economy rate, although with his leg stump bowling, {{he also had a}} strike rate of 94.45, while the other three fast bowlers all had strike rates below 70. It was a similar <b>tale</b> <b>in</b> the first-class statistics, with the second best economy among the seven frontline bowlers, but the worst strike rate. For the entire tour, Toshack took 50 wickets at 21.12 with four five-wicket innings hauls, including a best of 7/81 against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane. He also took 6/51 in the first innings of the match against the Marylebone Cricket Club, which was almost entirely represented by English Test cricketers. Toshack took two catches on tour, none of them in the Tests.|$|E
5|$|Seven matches {{remained}} on Bradman's quest {{to go through}} a tour of England without defeat. Loxton made 16 of 361 as Australia batted first against Kent. He came on late in the first innings and took three of the last four wickets as the hosts fell for 51 in just 23 overs. Loxton bowled all of his victims as the hosts fell from 5/48 to 51 all out. It was a similar <b>tale</b> <b>in</b> the second innings, as Loxton removed opener Jack Davies for a duck and ended with 1/12 from six overs as the hosts fell for 124 in only 32.5 overs. Australia had won the match by an innings within two days. In the next fixture against the Gentlemen of England, Loxton made only 17 as Australia eventually declared at 5/610 against a team that featured eight Test players. Loxton then took a match total of 0/37 from 21 overs as Australia completed another innings victory. Loxton was rested for the next match against Somerset, which the tourists won by an innings. Loxton then returned against the South of England. He came in at 5/427 and struck an unbeaten 67 in 75 minutes, before Australia declared at 7/522. He took 1/17 from 11 overs, removing Charlie Barnett as the hosts were bowled out for 298 in their first innings when rain ended the match.|$|E

5|$|Seven matches {{remained}} on Bradman's quest {{to go through}} a tour of England without defeat. Johnson returned and made 15 of 361 as Australia batted first against Kent. Johnson was not asked to bowl as the first four bowlers used cut down the hosts' first innings for 51 in just 23 overs. It was a similar <b>tale</b> <b>in</b> the second innings after Australia enforced the follow on. The pacemen did the early damage and Johnson bowled only briefly, sending down 4.5 overs and removing the last two batsmen to end with 2/15 as the hosts fell for 124 in 32.5 overs to seal another Australian victory by an innings in two days. In the next match against the Gentlemen of England, Johnson did not bat before Australia declared at 5/610 against a team featuring eight Test players. When the tourists bowled, Johnson took three consecutive wickets to reduce the hosts from 1/76 to 4/121. He ended with 4/60 from 23 overs as the Gentlemen made 245. Johnson's victims included Donnelly, future England opener Reg Simpson and former England captain Walter Robins. Bradman enforced the follow on, and Johnson took the last three wickets to end with 3/69 from 28.5 overs, including the scalps of Robins and Test player Freddie Brown. This completed another innings victory for the tourists. Johnson broke through for his first century of the tour in the next match against Somerset. Australia batted first and Johnson came in at No. 6 with the score at 4/306 to join Ron Hamence, who was also looking for his first ton of the season. The pair put on 195 runs, before Hamence fell at the closest possible point to his century, stumped for 99. Miller came out and helped Johnson add another 59 before Australia declared at 5/560, with the latter undefeated on 113. Following his innings, Johnson only bowled 10 overs in taking 1/19 for the match. The hosts were bowled out twice for a combined total of 186 from a sum of just 81.3 overs as Australia enforced the follow on and won by an innings and 374 runs. Johnson was rested for the fixture against the South of England. Australia declared at 7/522 and bowled out the hosts for 298 when rain ended the match.|$|E
