500|$|Work at {{the pump}} {{stations}} and marine terminal, which had not stopped during the winter, continued throughout the 1976 construction season. Pump Station 6, {{just south of the}} Yukon River, had to be redesigned after excavation revealed ice-rich permafrost below the site. Five pump stations needed at startup (when throughput was lower) received their pumps, turbines, and piping. As they were completed, the pump stations received hydrostatic testing, in which portions of pipe were filled with water and subjected to pressures in excess of the eventual operating conditions. Following this testing, the initial five pump stations were disconnected from the main pipeline and had oil run through them on a continuous loop. [...] "It's very similar <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>new</b> automobile," [...] one worker said. [...] "You drive it around for ten days so that any components that are going to fail are given time to fail." [...] Work on additional pump stations, which would not be needed until the pipeline was brought to full capacity, was not pressed forward.|$|E
