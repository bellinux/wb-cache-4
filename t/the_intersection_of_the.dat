5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot {{as the center of}} a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain, falling with distance from the hotspot, particularly at <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely explanation is that the region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating than most of the chain. Another possible explanation is that the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E

5|$|After a {{company-wide}} {{contest to}} name the aircraft, the initial prototype received the name Pirate and made its first flight on 2 October 1946. Flight testing revealed severe aerodynamic problems, mostly caused by the airfoil section and thickness of the wing. The vertical stabilizer also had to be redesigned to smooth out the airflow at <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horizontal and vertical stabilizers. Other changes included the addition of dive brakes {{on the sides of}} the fuselage and the replacement of the Metalite panels near the engine's exhaust with stainless steel ones.|$|E
5|$|Because the Moon's {{orbit around}} Earth is {{inclined}} by about 5.145° (5° 9') to {{the orbit of}} Earth around the Sun, eclipses do not occur at every full and new moon.

5|$|Castle Acre Castle {{and town}} walls are {{a set of}} ruined medieval defences built {{in the village of}} Castle Acre, Norfolk. The castle was built soon after the Norman Conquest by William de Warenne, the Earl of Surrey, at <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River Nar and the Peddars Way. William {{constructed}} a motte-and-bailey castle during the 1070s, protected by large earthwork ramparts, with a large country house in the centre of the motte. Soon after, a small community of Cluniac monks were given the castle's chapel in the outer bailey; under William, the second earl, the order was given land and estates to establish Castle Acre Priory alongside the castle. A deer park was created nearby for hunting.|$|E

5|$|In mathematics, {{particularly}} {{algebraic topology}} and homology theory, the Mayer–Vietoris sequence is an algebraic tool to help compute algebraic invariants of topological spaces, known as their homology and cohomology groups. The result {{is due to}} two Austrian mathematicians, Walther Mayer and Leopold Vietoris. The method consists of splitting a space into subspaces, for which the homology or cohomology groups may be easier to compute. The sequence relates the (co)homology groups of the space to the (co)homology groups of the subspaces. It is a natural long exact sequence, whose entries are the (co)homology groups of the whole space, the direct sum of the (co)homology groups of the subspaces, and the (co)homology groups of <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subspaces.|$|E

5|$|Ocepeia {{lived at}} a time when {{northwest}} Africa was at <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean and the ancient Tethys Ocean, and much of the area was flooded by shallow, warm inland seas. Ocepeia fossils are associated with diverse sharks, birds, and marine reptiles, and a small number of early mammals, including other condylarths and early proboscideans. The early appearance and specialized features of Ocepeia suggest afrotherians originated and diversified within Africa, contrary to theories suggesting a more northern origin.|$|E

5|$|When a {{wave train}} strikes a wall at an oblique angle, the {{reflected}} wave train departs at the supplementary angle causing a cross-hatched wave interference pattern {{known as the}} clapotis gaufré ("waffled clapotis"). In this situation, the individual crests formed at <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident and reflected wave train crests move parallel to the structure.

This in turn means that the foreign firm's best response is to cut output, although not proportionally (hence, the market price falls). In the new equilibrium domestic firm produces more and foreign firm produces less.|$|E
