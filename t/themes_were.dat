5|$|Erotica was {{a subject}} the Hoysala artist handled with discretion. There is no {{exhibitionism}} in this, and erotic <b>themes</b> <b>were</b> carved into recesses and niches, generally miniature in form, making them inconspicuous. These erotic representations {{are associated with}} the Shakta practice.|$|E
5|$|LGBT <b>themes</b> <b>were</b> found {{first in}} {{underground}} or alternative comics, often published by small independent presses or self-published. Such comics frequently advocated political positions and included depictions of sex, usually not intended solely to cause arousal but included {{as part of}} the exploration of themes including gender and sexuality.|$|E
5|$|These <b>themes</b> <b>were</b> later expounded upon in The Fundamentals, {{a series}} of essays financed by wealthy Presbyterians Milton and Lyman Stewart. While the authors were drawn from the wider evangelical community, a large {{proportion}} were Presbyterian, including Warfield, William Erdman, Charles Erdman, and Robert Elliott Speer.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{majority}} of the music has been released only in Japan, the first soundtrack was released worldwide and tracks from the Kingdom Hearts series have been featured in Video Games Live at multiple venues. The music has overall been well received and several tracks have received particular praise. The two main <b>themes</b> <b>were</b> well received by both video game and music critics, and did well on Japan's Oricon Weekly Singles chart.|$|E
5|$|As the {{paperback}} book came into fashion, lesbian <b>themes</b> <b>were</b> relegated to pulp fiction. Many of the pulp novels typically presented very unhappy women, or relationships that ended tragically. Marijane Meaker later wrote {{that she was}} told to make the relationship end badly in Spring Fire because the publishers {{were concerned about the}} books being confiscated by the U.S. Postal Service. Patricia Highsmith, writing as Claire Morgan, wrote The Price of Salt in 1951 and refused to follow this directive, but instead used a pseudonym.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, gay {{relationships}} were discouraged from being shown in comics which were seen mainly as directed towards children. Until 1989, the Comics Code Authority (CCA), which imposed de facto censorship on comics sold through news stands in the United States, forbade any suggestion of homosexuality. Artists had to drop subtle hints while not stating directly a character's orientation. Overt gay and lesbian <b>themes</b> <b>were</b> first found in underground and alternative titles which did not carry the CCA's seal of approval.|$|E

5|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Motoi Sakuraba, who had composed {{for nearly all}} the previous Tales games, and his regular partner Shinji Tamura, the latter working under the alias Hibiki Aoyama. While creating the soundtrack, Sakuraba {{was caught in the}} transition between sequenced to prerecorded streamed music, the latter of which gave room for rearrangements and improvisation mid-production. Sequenced music had been used up to Abyss, so {{it was the first time}} in the series that Sakuraba used this method, although he had done so for all his other projects at the time. For some tracks, a heavy piano element was used, with Sakuraba playing the instrument. Tamura worked with Sakuraba to create different feelings for the various tracks: character <b>themes</b> <b>were</b> melodic, dungeon <b>themes</b> <b>were</b> given a simple and minimalist mood, while town themes struck a balance between these two approaches. In addition to original tracks, three remixed tracks from other Namco Bandai games were included.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, most war {{memorials}} {{were relatively}} conservative in design, aiming to use established styles {{to produce a}} tragic but comforting, noble and enduring commemoration of the war dead. Classical <b>themes</b> <b>were</b> particularly common, taking the prevailing styles of the late 19th century and typically simplifying them to produce cleaner, more abstract memorials. Allegorical and symbolic features, frequently drawing on Christian imagery, were used to communicate themes of self-sacrifice, victory and death. Some memorials adopted a medievalist theme instead, looking backwards to a more secure past, while others used emerging realist and Art Deco architectural styles to communicate the themes of the war.|$|E
5|$|Duvall, who had {{appeared}} in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), which Foote adapted from the Harper Lee novel, was involved in Tender Mercies as an actor and co-producer from its earliest stages. He said the script appealed to him because of the basic values it underlined and because the <b>themes</b> <b>were</b> universal even though the story was local. Duvall felt it portrayed people from the central region of the United States without parodying them, as he said many Hollywood films tend to do. Duvall's early involvement led to rumors that he had requested Foote write the script for him, something that both men denied.|$|E

5|$|Greek mythology {{culminates in}} the Trojan War, fought between Greece and Troy, and its aftermath. In Homer's works, {{such as the}} Iliad, the chief stories have already taken shape and substance, and {{individual}} <b>themes</b> <b>were</b> elaborated later, especially in Greek drama. The Trojan War also elicited great interest in the Roman culture because {{of the story of}} Aeneas, a Trojan hero whose journey from Troy led to the founding of the city that would one day become Rome, as recounted in Virgil's Aeneid (Book II of Virgil's Aeneid contains the best-known account of the sack of Troy). Finally there are two pseudo-chronicles written in Latin that passed under the names of Dictys Cretensis and Dares Phrygius.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Arab conquests during the 7th century, the whole administrative and military system of the Empire was reformed, and the thematic system established. According to this, the Empire was divided into several themata, which were regional civil and military administrations. Under the command of a stratēgos, each thema maintained its own, locally levied forces. Following a series of revolts by thematic forces, under Constantine V the larger early <b>themes</b> <b>were</b> progressively broken up, while a central imperial army, the tagmata, was created, stationed at or near Constantinople, serving as a central reserve that henceforth formed the core of campaigning armies.|$|E
5|$|LGBT {{themes in}} comics are a {{relatively}} new concept, as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) themes and characters were historically omitted intentionally from the content of comic books and their comic strip predecessors, due to either censorship or the perception that comics were for children. With any mention of homosexuality in mainstream United States comics forbidden by the Comics Code Authority (CCA) until 1989, earlier attempts at exploring these issues in the US {{took the form of}} subtle hints or subtext regarding a character's sexual orientation. LGBT <b>themes</b> <b>were</b> tackled earlier in underground comix from the early 1970s onward. Independently published one-off comic books and series, often produced by gay creators and featuring autobiographical storylines, tackled political issues of interest to LGBT readers.|$|E

5|$|Love Hina {{was adapted}} into a 24-episode anime {{television}} series by Xebec, {{a division of}} Production I.G. The series aired on TV Tokyo April 19 through September 27, 2000. The opening theme was Sakura Saku and the closing theme was Kimi Sae Ireba. Both songs were written by Ritsuko Okazaki and performed by Megumi Hayashibara. The two <b>themes</b> <b>were</b> released as a CD single, which debuted on the Oricon charts at Number 7. A bonus 25th episode was later created and released as a DVD bonus. The series and bonus episode were directed by Yoshiaki Iwasaki, written by Shō Aikawa and featured character designs by Makoto Uno.|$|E
5|$|Nighthawk is a steel flying {{roller coaster}} from Vekoma located at Carowinds {{amusement}} park. The roller coaster originally opened as Stealth at California's Great America on April 1, 2000. In 2003, Paramount decided to relocate {{the roller coaster}} to Carowinds. It reopened as Borg Assimilator – the first coaster {{in the world to}} be themed to Star Trek – on March 20, 2004. After Cedar Fair purchased Carowinds in 2006, Paramount <b>themes</b> <b>were</b> soon removed from the park, and the ride was renamed Nighthawk. It is one of only three Flying Dutchman models still in existence from Vekoma.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the book's publication, Garland had {{approached}} the film's producers—Andrew Macdonald and Andrew Reich—about a possible film, {{and wrote a}} 96-page script. The producers initially had trouble finding an actress to play Kathy. Mulligan was cast in the role after Peter Rice, {{the head of the}} company financing the film, recommended her by text message while watching her performance in An Education. Mulligan, a fan of the book, enthusiastically accepted the role, as it had long been a wish of hers {{to have the opportunity to}} play the part. The film's message and <b>themes</b> <b>were</b> the factors that attracted Garfield to become a part of the film.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{pieces of}} <b>theme</b> music <b>were</b> used for both anime seasons; one opening theme and one ending theme each.

5|$|Realistic {{religious}} painting, sometimes entire {{series of}} related works, served its didactic purpose. Nudity and mythological <b>themes</b> <b>were</b> banned, {{but other than}} that fancy collection of Western paintings were in vogue. Sigismund III brought from Venice Tommaso Dolabella. A prolific painter, he was {{to spend the rest of}} his life in Kraków and give rise to a school of Polish painters working under his influence. Danzig (Gdańsk) was also a center for graphic arts; painters Herman Han and Bartholomäus Strobel worked there, and so did Willem Hondius and Jeremias Falck, who were engravers. As compared with the previous century, even wider circles of the society participated in cultural activities, but Catholic Counter-Reformation pressure resulted in diminished diversity. Catastrophic wars in the middle of the century greatly weakened the Commonwealth's cultural development and influence in the region.|$|E
5|$|Shore {{composed}} a main theme for The Fellowship rather than many different character themes, and its strength and weaknesses in volume are depicted {{at different points}} in the series. On top of that, individual <b>themes</b> <b>were</b> composed to represent different cultures. Infamously, the amount of music Shore had to write every day for the third film increased dramatically to around seven minutes. The music for the series {{turned out to be a}} success and has been voted best movie soundtrack of all time for the six years running, passing up Schindler's list, Gladiator, Star Wars (1977), and Out of Africa respectively.|$|E
5|$|Skyscraper {{development}} paused {{during the}} years of the Second World War. Once development began again in the 1950s and 1960s, the skyscraper entered a different phase of development, usually called the international or modern period. Some experimental designs in this style had been built in the U.S. using European architectural concepts in the early 1930s, most notably the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society and McGraw-Hill Buildings. Post-war, their modernist <b>themes</b> <b>were</b> used in a new generation of skyscrapers. These stood alone on individual plots in the fashion of the Rockefeller Centre's RCA building, rather than as part of a row of buildings, forming huge slabs and towers featuring huge glass façades, breaking with earlier skyscraper traditions. Inside, new technologies such as fluorescent lighting and widespread air-conditioning meant that many older architectural features such as light courts and operable windows were unnecessary.|$|E
500|$|The first opening <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> [...] "Philosophyz (TV {{animation}} ver.)" [...] and {{the first}} ending <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> , both sung by Runa Mizutani of NanosizeMir.
