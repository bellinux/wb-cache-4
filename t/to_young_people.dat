5|$|On {{the advice}} of Roosevelt's secretary, Malvina Thompson, Hickok then sought work in New York with public {{relations}} man and politician Grover Whalen. Shortly after Franklin Roosevelt's 1936 re-election, Hickok was hired by Whalen to do publicity for the 1939 New York World's Fair. Opportunities for female employees of the Fair were limited, and she found the work unrewarding compared to her reporting days. Hickok primarily worked on promoting the fair <b>to</b> <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> including arranging class trips. Because Hickok rented both a country home and an apartment, she often faced financial problems despite her good salary during these years, and Roosevelt occasionally sent her small gifts of money.|$|E

5|$|SCI is {{extremely}} disruptive to sexuality, and it most frequently happens <b>to</b> <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> {{who are at}} a peak in their sexual and reproductive lives. Yet the importance of sexuality {{as a part of}} life is not diminished by a disabling injury. Although for years people with SCI were believed to be asexual, research has shown sexuality to be a high priority for people with SCI and an important aspect of quality of life. In fact, of all abilities they would like to have return, most paraplegics rated sexual function as their top priority, and most tetraplegics rated it second, after hand and arm function. Sexual function has a profound impact on self-esteem and adjustment to life post-injury. People who are able to adapt to their changed bodies and to have satisfying sex lives have better overall quality of life.|$|E

40|$|This {{study has}} {{examined}} concepts of empowerment {{as they relate}} <b>to</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> health. Beginning with an analysis of recent theories of power, the thesis offers a critical exploration of the conceptualisation of empowerment and identifies how current uses of the term appear to have moved away from many of their original theoretical underpinnings. Identifying these theoretical tensions provided the impetus for an empirical enquiry which sought to critically question the relationship between empowerment and <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> health. The goal of the investigation was to reveal the possibilities for, and limitations of, empowerment among <b>young</b> <b>people.</b> Informed by an interpretivist epistemology and drawing upon ethnographic methods, {{data were collected from}} <b>young</b> <b>people</b> aged 15 - 16 years through focus group discussions, individual interviews and observational data in a school and surrounding community settings. Themes drawn from the research were analysed for their implications for `emic' conceptualisations of health and empowerment. Key findings pointed <b>to</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> preference for more positive understandings of <b>young</b> <b>people</b> and their health. Participants described how dominant perceptions of <b>young</b> <b>people</b> as 'immature' and 'risky' negatively impacted on their health; shaping subsequent possibilities for, and limitations of, their empowerment. Based on study findings and informed by Steven Lukes' (2005) tripartite perspective on power, the thesis offers a new conceptual framework for understanding the concept of empowerment and its relationship <b>to</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> health...|$|R
