Jeweling to the center wheel adds two more giving 17 jewels in total. Thus, a 17 jewel watch {{is considered to be}} fully jeweled.|$|R

This method of driving the seconds hand is called indirect center seconds. Because the gearing was outside the plates, it added to the thickness of the movement, and because the rotation of the <b>third</b> <b>wheel</b> had to be geared up to turn the seconds hand once a minute, the seconds hand had a fluttering motion.|$|R

50|$|Additional jewels beyond 17 {{are used}} to either add cap jewels, or to jewel the {{mainspring}} barrel of the watch. Watches with 19 jewels, particularly those made by Elgin and Waltham, will often have a jeweled mainspring barrel. Alternatively a 19 jewel watch will have additional cap jewels on the escape <b>wheel.</b> 21 <b>jewel</b> watches commonly have cap jewels on both the pallet fork and escape <b>wheel.</b> 23 <b>jewel</b> watches will have a jeweled barrel and fully capped escapement. The timekeeping value of jewels beyond 17 for a time-only movement is often debated.|$|R

50|$|Greg is {{also noted}} for having many attractions to girls {{throughout}} the series, most notably {{a girl named}} Holly Hills, his classmate. His schemes usually fails {{in the hope of}} attracting a girl. One very notable example is The <b>Third</b> <b>Wheel,</b> where Greg attempts to use Rowley as a wingman to get himself a date for the upcoming Valentine's Day dance. He succeeds in obtaining the chance to take a girl named Abigail Brown to the dance, but Rowley, who tags along as a <b>third</b> <b>wheel,</b> hence the name, proves to be a better date than Greg at the dance. This ultimately leads to Rowley and Abigail becoming a couple, setting the stage for Hard Luck.|$|R

5000|$|Other tilters use the <b>third</b> <b>wheel</b> {{to resist}} wind loads and force a faster lean {{to set up}} for a fast corner or {{emergency}} lane change. Opinion is divided {{on how best to}} control this benefit. Some sort of pendulum and servo is the [...] "obvious" [...] solution, but this system is generally accepted to be unsuitable {{due to the fact that}} the observation by the pendulum occurs after the event of steering onto the curved path and so too late to allow proper vehicle dynamics. Various electric and hydraulic systems have been employed to modify TTW behaviour, with notable success on the Carver. Another system has the driver controlling the tilt only, and the chassis steering automatically, so the <b>third</b> <b>wheel</b> is well used, and it may be easier to learn for drivers.|$|R

50|$|In 1974, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in {{collaboration}} with the Swiss watch industry standards organization NIHS: Normes de l'Industrie Horlogère Suisse published a standard, ISO 1112, which prohibited manufacturers from including such nonfunctional jewels in the jewel counts in advertising and sales literature. This put a stop to the use of totally nonfunctional jewels. However, some experts say manufacturers have continued to inflate the jewel count of their watches by 'upjeweling'; adding functional <b>jeweled</b> bearings to <b>wheels</b> that do not really need them, exploiting loopholes in ISO 1112. Examples given include adding capstones to <b>third</b> and fourth <b>wheel</b> bearings, <b>jeweling</b> minute <b>wheel</b> bearings, and automatic winding ratchet pawls. Arguably none of these additions adds to the accuracy or longevity of the watch.|$|R

50|$|Fourth wheel - In clocks {{and watches}} {{with the second}} hand in a subdial on the face, this turns once per minute, and the shaft {{projects}} through the face and holds the second hand.
