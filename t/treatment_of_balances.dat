Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Reciprocal Electrical Stimulation (RES) on dorsi and planter flexors of both ankles in <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> dysfunction after submission to botulinum toxin (BT-A). Methods: Thirty children with spastic diplegia, aged from 4 to 6 years with mean 4. 9 ± 0. 779 were assigned randomly into two groups of equal numbers: study group received RES in addition to physical exercise program 3 times weekly for 3 months and control group received the same physical exercise program without RES for the same number of sessions as in study group. Static and the functional balance were assessed pre-treatment and 3 months post-treatment in both groups (using the Biodex Balance system and Berg’s balance scale consequently).

Participants were assessed at baseline (pre-PTA) and then 3, 6, and 12 months post-PTA for markers of (1) lower limb ischemia (treadmill walking distances and ankle-brachial pressure index), (2) physical function (6 -minute walk, Timed Up and Go, and chair stand time), (3) balance impairment using computerized dynamic posturography with the Sensory Organization Test, and (4) quality of life (VascuQoL and Short Form Health Survey [SF- 36]).

40|$|Introduction Vestibular {{neuritis}} rapidly damages unilateral vestibular periphery, inducing severe balance disorders. In most cases, such vestibular imbalance {{is gradually}} restored to within the normal level after clinical therapies. This successive clinical recovery occurs due to regeneration of vestibular periphery and/or accomplishment of central vestibular compensation. Rehabilitation The program of vestibular rehabilitation presents a major {{achievement in the}} field <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> disorders. Vestibular compensation is associated with central sensory reintegration and bilaterally equalizes the vestibular tonus {{over a period of}} time. Material and methods In this retrospective study of a series of cases authors present their results in 58 patients undergoing a program of vestibular rehabilitation. Patients were divided into two groups. Thirty patients were in group I, and 28 in group II. Specific vestibular exercises were conducted in group I, and non-specific exercises in group II. Analysis of effects of vestibular compensation was made due electronystagmography. Results Results were satisfactory in both groups of patients. Absence of spontaneous nystagmus was detected in 83. 3 % of patients in group I (specific vestibular exercises) and in 53. 5 % of patients in group II (non-specific exercises), with an average <b>treatment</b> time <b>of</b> up to 2 months. Harmonization of pendular stimulation was detected in 83. 3 % and 60. 7 % of patients in groups I and II, respectively.

40|$|Following {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture, reconstructive surgery (ALCR) is often performed to mechanically stabilise the knee, however functional deficits often persist long after surgery. Impaired single-limb standing balance has been observed in the ACLR limb compared to healthy individuals. However, it remains inconclusive as to whether these same balance deficits exist between the injured and contralateral uninjured limbs, during challenging balance tasks, {{and at a time}} when patients are permitted to return to sport. 100 adults who had undergone a primary hamstring-tendon ACLR 12 months previously (68 male; median[IQR] age: 28. 1 [14. 1] years) performed tests of single-limb standing with the knee in a functional position of 20 – 30 ° flexion, with their eyes closed, over 20  s (Nintendo Wii Balance Board). Two repetitions were performed on the ACLR and uninjured limb. Measures of postural control included centre of pressure (CoP) path velocity, anterior-posterior and mediolateral range and standard deviation, and were averaged across the two trials. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests showed no significant between-leg differences in single-limb <b>balance</b> for any <b>of</b> the CoP measures of interest (all P values >  0. 686). Further, multiple linear regression analyses showed no significant associations between concomitant meniscectomy or chondral lesions noted at the time of ACLR and measures <b>of</b> single-limb <b>balance</b> on the ACLR limb one year later (all P values >  0. 213).

40|$|Maintaining upright bipedal posture {{requires}} a control system that continually adapts to changing environmental conditions, such as different support surfaces. Behavioral changes associated with different support surfaces, {{such as the}} predominance of an ankle or hip strategy, is considered to reflect {{a change in the}} control strategy. However, tracing such behavioral changes to a specific component in a closed loop control system is challenging. Here we used the joint input-output (JIO) method of closed-loop system identification to identify the musculoskeletal and neural feedback components of the human postural control loop. The goal was to establish changes in the control loop corresponding to behavioral changes observed on different support surfaces. Subjects were simultaneously perturbed by two independent mechanical and two independent sensory perturbations while standing on a normal or short support surface. The results show a dramatic phase reversal between visual input and body kinematics due to the change in surface condition from trunk leads legs to legs lead trunk with increasing frequency of the visual perturbation. Through decomposition of the control loop, we found that behavioral change is not necessarily due to a change in control strategy, {{but in the case of}} different support surfaces, is linked to changes in properties of the plant. The JIO method is an important tool to identify the contribution of specific components within a closed loop control system to overall postural behavior and may be useful to devise better <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> disorders...|$|R
40|$|LL. M. (Commercial Law) Abstract: The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa is {{the supreme}} {{law in the}} land. Thus, all law {{is subject to the}} Constitution and this inevitably {{includes}} the law of contract. The South African law of contract has been inherited from common law, namely Roman–Dutch law and has been applicable in South Africa to date. The Constitution states that the common law should be developed when it is not in line with the provisions of the Constitution. The values underpinning the Constitution are human dignity equality and freedom and these values must therefore be reflected in contractual relations. The common law principle of pacta sunt servanda, which means that agreements must be kept, at times this principle yields unjust and unreasonable results. The strict adherence to pacta sunt servanda has led to difficulties. The unenforceability of these contract terms has been shown in reported case law to stem from standard term contracts, unequal bargaining power and from persons who contract out of necessity. This dissertation concludes that South African law of contract and the current legal <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>balancing</b> contract law with constitutional values is unsatisfactory.

While the relationship between gait speed and community ambulation has been well established, other underlying factors that may influence return to independent community ambulation post stroke are not clearly understood. Aims and Objectives: The aim of this research was to investigate the factors associated with community ambulation in patients between one and three years post stroke. More specifically, it examined the association of multiple personal and post stroke factors with community ambulation and which factors were independently associated with community ambulation. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used. Forty community-dwelling stroke patients, between one and three years post stroke were recruited into the study. Each participant attended Baggot Street Hospital for one assessment. The primary outcome measure was a Community Ambulation Questionnaire. Other outcome measures included: 10 Metre Walk Test, Timed-Up and Go Test, Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Trail-Making Test-Part B and Single Letter Cancellation Test. Demographic information was also recorded ii Results: Age, number of medications and use of a walking aid were found to be significantly associated with community ambulation (p ≤ 0. 05). Gait speed, walking balance and balance self-efficacy were also found to be significantly associated with community ambulation (p ≤ 0. 05). Balance self-efficacy was the only factor independently associated with community ambulation post stroke. Conclusion: Balance self-efficacy may be a significant determinant in the attainment {{of independent}} community ambulation post stroke.
