5|$|In the Third Test against New Zealand in 2000, Gilchrist {{recorded}} the third best <b>Test</b> <b>performance</b> ever by a wicketkeeper, {{and the best}} by an Australian, taking ten catches in the match. Although Gilchrist's batting was modest, yielding 144 runs at 36.00, Australia took a 3–0 clean sweep. In two home and away ODI series against South Africa, Gilchrist had a quiet time, scoring 170 runs at 26.66. South Africa won three of the six matches, with one tie.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{elected to}} field on a wet wicket in the Fourth Test at Headingley. Miller {{dismissed}} Edrich and Graveney {{and ended with}} 2/39 from 38overs as England were bowled out for 167. Miller made only five in the first innings. In the second innings, Miller and Lindwall launched a short-pitched barrage and dismissed Watson and Simpson in consecutive balls. England were 5/177 a stumps on day four, leading by 78. The pacemen were booed from the field. The next day, Miller dismissed Evans early, before Trevor Bailey began his resistance. Frustrated by Bailey's defensive style and time-wasting, Miller lost his cool and aimed a beamer straight at Bailey's head, further angering the crowd. Miller ended with 4/63 from a long spell of 47overs. England held on for another draw after more time-wasting by Bailey. The teams headed for the Fifth Test at The Oval tied 0–0. Miller's last <b>Test</b> <b>performance</b> was his least productive; he scored one and a duck and took a total of 2/89. England won the match and regained the Ashes. Miller's returns were below his career standards, with 223runs at 24.77 and 10wickets at 30.30. He took two catches.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to tests in Sweden, the X2 was tried {{out on the}} Randsfjord Line on 12 March 1993. The order for the units was placed on 23 February 1995, after NSB had received bids from ABB (that later merged with Daimler's train division to become ADtranz), AEG, Fiat Ferroviaria, Talbot, Linke-Hofmann-Busch, Siemens and Görlitz. During 1996, an X2 train was rented to test out performance on the Norwegian railway system, and {{for a short period}} put into service on the Sørland Line. The first Class 71 unit was delivered on 19 September 1997, and the last on 30 January 1998. The last unit, no. 71.16, was delivered with tilting mechanism to be used to <b>test</b> <b>performance</b> on the Norwegian railways, due to the similarities between Class 71 and Class 73. It could be seen during the winter on the challenging Bergen Line and Dovre Line. After a few years the tilting mechanism was removed.|$|E

5|$|In the Second Test at Sydney, Johnston took 3/56 and 3/70 in a low-scoring match, {{removing}} Hutton in both innings. He {{had another}} notable innings {{when he joined}} Neil Harvey with 78 runs needed for victory on a difficult batting surface against the hostile pace of Frank Tyson and Brian Statham. In particular, Tyson was bowling with a strong tailwind and a slips cordon standing around 40 yards behind the bat. They put together a stubborn 39 run tenth-wicket partnership in 40 minutes, which gave Australia hope of an unlikely victory with Harvey still attacking. Harvey felt that Tyson was almost out of energy after a spell of extreme pace, and that the remaining bowlers were not beyond Johnston. However, a Tyson ball that was aimed at the ribcage saw Johnston fend at the ball; he was caught behind for 11, giving England a dramatic victory. After taking 1/26 in the first innings, Johnston took 5/85 in the second innings of his last <b>Test</b> <b>performance</b> {{in front of his}} home crowd at the MCG, with some tight spin on a dry surface. He removed Edrich for 13 and Peter May for 91 before cleaning up the tail with three quick wickets. This left Australia 240 to win but there was to be no fairytale as England won by 128 runs. Johnston then took match figures of 4/80 in the Fourth Test at Adelaide, in what was to be the his last Test on Australian soil. Australia lost the match and England retained the Ashes; it was Australia's third consecutive Test defeat, the first time they had suffered a hat-trick of defeats since the infamous Bodyline series of 1932–33. Johnston had less success outside the Tests, which were played on bowler-friendly surfaces. He managed only 13 wickets at 30.38 in five matches.|$|E
5|$|Similar to its predecessor, Brain Age 2 is an {{edutainment}} {{video game}} that offers the player several minigames to play. Before the game begins, the player must create a profile, after which Brain Age Check runs three random {{tests to determine}} the player's brain age, which ranges from 20 to 80 and depends on the player's <b>test</b> <b>performance.</b> The brain age determines approximately the responsiveness of the player's brain; a brain age of 20, the lowest age that the player can achieve, indicates that the player's brain is as responsive as that of an average 20-year-old. Once the player is told their initial brain age, three modes are unlocked: Quick Play, Daily Training, and Sudoku. In Quick Play, the player can practice {{with any of the}} available minigames without receiving a score. In Daily Training, the player can perform Brain Age Check to determine their updated brain age. They can also complete one of the available minigames, after which they are given a rating based on their performance. In Daily Training, the player can also play Virus Buster, a simplified version of Dr. Mario (1990) modified for mobile play. To let the player track their progress, the game saves daily statistics of the player's performance, which are shown in a graph. In the third mode, Sudoku, the player can solve one of a hundred Sudoku puzzles.|$|E
5|$|Toshack's {{performance}} in the First Test at Trent Bridge was a quiet one, taking a wicket in each innings. He was involved in an aggressive final wicket partnership of 32 with Johnston, scoring 19runs, his best at Test level to date in just 18minutes. Toshack's best <b>Test</b> <b>performance</b> was his 5/40 in the second innings of the Second Test at Lord's when Miller was unable to bowl after being injured, including the wickets of Cyril Washbrook, Bill Edrich, captain Yardley and Alec Coxon. During this performance, he employed two short legs and a silly mid-off. He had a moderately successful Third Test, taking figures of 3/101 in the only Test that Australia did not win. His knee injury flared again in the Fourth Test after taking an ineffective 1/112 in the first innings, {{he was unable to}} bowl in the second innings of an Australian win. He made a recovery and it was hoped that {{he would be able to}} play in the Fifth Test, but he injured again himself in the lead-up match against Lancashire. He was taken to London for cartilage surgery, ending his tour and his Test career. An inept batsman with an average of 5.78 in first-class fixtures, Toshack managed a Test average of 51 on the 1948 tour after being out only once, behind only Arthur Morris, Sid Barnes, Bradman and Neil Harvey. The unbeaten 20 he managed in the Lord's Test was his best first-class score, made in an uninhibited tenth-wicket stand with Johnston. Due to the fragility of his knee, Toshack was used sparingly in the tour games, playing in only 11 of the 29 non-Test matches on the tour. Toshack totalled 50 wickets at the average of 21.12 for the tour.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{begins by}} {{distinguishing}} between task-based <b>testing</b> and <b>performance</b> <b>testing.</b> It then provides a short historical {{overview of the}} development of performance assessment. Next, a preliminary overview of the <b>performance</b> <b>testing</b> literature sketches out some of the general trends in that literature including the fact that that it already contains many (a) overviews and discussions of language <b>performance</b> <b>testing,</b> (b) many papers and books providing guidelines for developing and doing <b>performance</b> <b>testing,</b> and (c) numerous articles on the place of <b>performance</b> <b>testing</b> in language curriculum. The paper then restricts itself to looking at the most productive recent areas of research on <b>performance</b> <b>testing</b> with the goal of addressing the following key questions (that also serve as main headings in the paper) : 1. What happens when actual <b>performance</b> <b>tests</b> are developed and validated? 2. What are the characteristics of <b>performance</b> <b>tests?</b> 3. What are the benefits of <b>performance</b> <b>testing</b> (why bother?) ? 4. What factors are involved in performance task difficulty? 5. How should we best go about scoring <b>performance</b> <b>tests</b> (in terms of scoring criteria and rater effects) ? 6. Are <b>performance</b> <b>tests</b> reliable? 7. Are <b>performance</b> <b>tests</b> valid? 8. Are there other issues about <b>performance</b> <b>tests</b> that need to be researched?

Australia had a scrum in their own territory and Campese was in position for a clearing kick. Campese instead opted to run and dummied past South African openside flanker Francois Pienaar. Campese's run brought play into South African territory. Campese then flicked a pass along the ground, described by Australian rugby commentator David Fordham as an 'ill-discipled pass', that Australian eightman Tim Gavin recovered. Two phases later Campese took a pass from Nick Farr-Jones in the first-receiver position, launched a high kick that his opposite winger Jacques Olivier wasn't able to field. The ball took a fortuitous bounce, and Australian inside centre Tim Horan was able to chase the ball down and fall upon it to score a try.|$|E
