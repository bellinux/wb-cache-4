40|$|Transgenic {{crops are}} {{widespread}} {{in some countries}} and sectors of the agro-economy, but are also highly contentious. Proponents of <b>transgenic</b> <b>crop</b> improvement often cite the “substantial equivalence” of transgenic crops to the their nontransgenic parents and sibling varieties. Opponents of <b>transgenic</b> <b>crop</b> improvement dismiss the substantial equivalence standard as being without statistical basis and emphasize the possible unintended effects to food quality and composition due to genetic transformation. Systems biology approaches should help consumers, regulators, and other stakeholders make better decisions regarding <b>transgenic</b> <b>crop</b> improvement by characterizing the composition of conventional and transgenically improved crop species and products. In particular, metabolomic profiling via mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance can make broad and deep assessments of food quality and content. The metabolome observed in a transgenic variety can then be assessed relative to the consumer and regulator accepted phenotypic range observed among conventional varieties. I briefly discuss both targeted (closed architecture) and nontargeted (open architecture) metabolomics {{with respect to the}} <b>transgenic</b> <b>crop</b> debate and highlight several challenges to the field.

40|$|A {{lack of data}} {{often makes}} {{biological}} management decisions difficult and has been an area of contention {{in the debate over}} the approval of <b>transgenic</b> <b>crops.</b> Our knowledge of agricultural and natural systems is limited and our ability to gain additional information, quickly and effectively, is often handicapped by statistical complexity.

40|$|In {{order to}} have a proper {{regulation}} or an amendment enacted for a particular technology or its derived products (<b>transgenic</b> <b>crops</b> in this case), it is essential for policymakers, in my view, to have a proper understanding of contemporary scientific study pertaining to that technology or research area. Similarly, based on this perception, a review of scientific empirical data is deemed to be important to understand why the precautionary principle has been implemented in the regulatory process of <b>transgenic</b> <b>crops</b> in the EU. For this reason a comprehensive compilation of available and accessible scientific literature is provided, in the first portion of the project thesis, to have a review of the environmental impacts, of <b>transgenic</b> <b>crops,</b> both beneficial and detrimental. In this project, the review for environmental impacts has been conducted in a peculiar way and an effort has been made to properly distribute available empirical data as outlined in the methodology of the project in order to comprehend impacts independently in terms of beneficial and detrimental. The objective is to weigh the potential of this technology against risks for policy and regulation purposes and to understand the precautionary principle/safety approach in the regulatory process at the EU level. Two questions that might arise while reading this thesis are; what connection does the safety approach of regulation have to environmental impacts? Or how do the environmental impacts correlate to the safety approach in the regulation? I maintain that if the EU has taken the precautionary principle (safety approach) in the regulation of <b>transgenic</b> <b>crops,</b> there are two major reasons. Firstly, due to the analysis of the available empirical scientific research data that has been conducted worldwide on <b>transgenic</b> <b>crops.</b> For example, result of the well-known monarch butterfly experiments was an influencing factor for the regulation of <b>transgenic</b> <b>crops</b> in the EU. Moreover, the scientific data has determined the regulation of transgenics in the EU and the precautionary principle itself is an essential element in the regulation of novel technologies like genetic engineering. Since the scientific data is an important element to determine the safety approach in the case of <b>transgenic</b> <b>crops,</b> there is no doubt, whatsoever, in the correlation of the study of environmental impacts of transgenics to the safety or precautionary principle in regulating this technology. Secondly, due to the social and political conditions prevalent in the EU, e. g. the precaution that the public has adopted in the use of <b>transgenic</b> <b>crops.</b> In this project thesis, the accessible and available data has been distributed in an unbiased manner to present an appropriate analysis for the environmental impacts and regulation of <b>transgenic</b> <b>crops...</b>|$|R

Minutes of the meeting of the Committee and interviews to related scientists were analyzed to understand the process to reach the conclusion. It is observed that the discussion among scientists has reached consensus through taking into account various kinds of knowledge, not only purely scientific but also institutional one, such as chronological consistency. Under the context of regulatory science, this latter type of knowledge (institutional knowledge) are accumulated within the committee and applied to the issue which constitutes a crucial factor to bring closure of the discussion.
