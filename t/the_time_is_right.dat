25|$|The {{concept of}} Tikkun olam (Repairing the World) {{is central to}} modern Rabbinic Judaism. Tikkun olam is {{accomplished}} through various means, such as ritualistically performing God's commandments, charity and social justice, {{as well as through}} example persuading {{the rest of the world}} to behave morally. According to some views, Tikkun Olam would result in the beginning of the Messianic Age. It has been said that in every generation, a person is born with the potential to be the spiritual Messiah. If <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> for the Messianic Age within that person's lifetime, then that person will be the mashiach. But if that person dies before he completes the mission of the Messiah, then that person is not the Messiah (Mashiach).|$|E

500|$|Cowell had preliminarily {{agreed to}} sign Talbot {{with his own}} record label, Sony BMG. After {{recording}} two songs in London with Talbot ("Over the Rainbow" [...] and [...] "Smile"), the label {{pulled out of the}} deal. Talbot's mother, Sharon, said she was told that her daughter [...] "...was too young to be their sort of artist", adding [...] "We have been told to look for a company which looks after children." [...] In a statement, the label said [...] "there was some deliberation over the possibility of recording with Connie... However, the decision not to proceed was made with the best intentions for Connie, taking into consideration her age and {{that it would not be}} right to do so at this time." [...] Cowell himself said that [...] "when <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>right,</b> [...] be delighted to see if [...] make it work". The Talbot family decided to search for another label, saying [...] "while [...] loves what she's doing it would be cruel to stop her. Fame and money will never matter." ...|$|E
500|$|Yankovic had {{previously}} heard [...] "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm" [...] during 1994 {{and felt that}} it was [...] "one of two or three songs" [...] that could be potentially parodied. He noted that it [...] "would be really good to do for the next album", but felt that [...] "when <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>right,</b> [...] think of something" [...] to write the parody about; he then returned his attention to writing original songs. After Scotti Brothers insisted on the writing of a new lead single, Yankovic very nearly had his label cancel the box set due to being unable to write under pressure. However, he soon returned to the idea of parodying [...] "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm". He decided to pair the song's music up with [...] "all the weird news stories that were going on" [...] and make each verse its own vignette. Yankovic also felt that by doing this and releasing it on the box set, {{he would be able to}} capitalize on the topicality of the issues.|$|E
500|$|In June 2009, Ray Davies told The Independent {{that while}} a {{full-fledged}} reunion was unlikely, [...] "I {{will continue to}} play with ex-band members like Mick Avory from time to time.

[...] When asked about a possible reunion in an interview that year, Avory stated, [...] "A reunion would not be possible with the originals, for a start due to ill health. But it would be possible with the Kast Off Kinks plus Ray. In any event Ray would record new material. We have some old tracks from the 80s as well." [...] In March 2010, Avory reported that the band were planning on releasing an album of unreleased and new material. He stated that they had [...] "eight tracks" [...] ready for the album, but that the Davies brothers had to settle their differences before the project could progress. It remains unclear who has been involved in the recordings besides Avory and Ray Davies.|$|E

Having served in Iraq, he returned to the UK to take up a staff post in April 2009 as chief of staff to the NATO Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC), but the appointment was short-lived as, in October 2009, he deployed to Afghanistan at short notice to establish a force reintegration unit, {{part of an effort to}} persuade Taliban fighters to rejoin society by offering alternatives to fighting, such as jobs and training—a role for which he was hand-picked by U.S. Army General Stanley A. McChrystal, then commander of all troops in Afghanistan. Barrons defended the controversial scheme in interviews, saying that it was not [...] "about buying insurgents off the battlefield" [...] and that [...] "the idea is that you get the whole community benefiting and turning against the insurgency". In a later interview, Barrons also said [...] "I am absolutely convinced it can be done, and that <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>right.</b> This is an opportunity the Afghan people aren't going to get again. Most of them realize that, and are keen to take it now".|$|E
