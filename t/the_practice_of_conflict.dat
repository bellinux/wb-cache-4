The research is similar in nature to contingency theory tests in China (Li, Cropp, and Jin, 2010; Zhang, Qui and Cameron, 2004), South Korea (Bae and Park, 2011; Choi and Cameron, 2005; Shin, Heath, and Lee, 2011) and Singapore (Jin, Pang, and Cameron, 2006). The study finds that factors in all 11 categories of contingency theory manifest, suggesting that the principles of contingency theory are relevant to <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> management for communication practitioners in Norway. While no entirely new factors manifest, a clear fact-based orientation emerges for the existing factor "how individuals receive, process and use information and influence" emerges.

40|$|Abstract: Issues around {{lying and}} {{deception}} arise constantly in ethics and in <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> resolution, {{so it would}} be useful to have clear definitions of the different varieties. This paper starts with a system of Colombetti’s, a set of axioms that treat honest assertive communications using a small number of concepts, mostly intentions and beliefs. His approach is extended to allow for deception and lies, and related forms like insincere offers and requests, or false promises, tricks, manipulations, betrayals, half-truths, talking through one’s hat, and giving one’s word falsely. Some results are the distinction between lying intentionally and intending to lie, the definition of trickery versus deception in general, and a systematization of different kinds of promises and ways of performing them insincerely. The definitions are compared with a plentiful source of deceptions, the Book of Genesis...|$|E

40|$|As a {{national}} organization with a proud and distinguished history in conflict resolution, FMCS has always felt a particular obligation to promote professionalism and {{public confidence in the}} mediation process. In light of the growing number of individuals who identify themselves as 2 ̆ 2 mediators 2 ̆ 2, and the lack of any uniform standards for the practice of mediation, FMCS is the first national organization to credential outside private and public sector mediators. We are focusing on three specific dispute resolution disciplines: labor, employment, and regulatory negotiations. Credentialing does not restrict mediation practitioners to the extent that licensure and certification would. Rather, credentialing distinguishes those who meet requisite standards from those who do not, and relies upon the principles of free market choice for consumers of the service. FMCS has been joined in this initiative by both academic institutions and professional associations. We have developed core competencies and experience levels for each discipline to be credentialed, including negotiation skills, mediation skills, facilitation, and multi-party conflict management. The work of the Federal Mediator will continue to evolve as the forces that affect work, business and human relations continue to exert their influences on our society. And, <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> resolution will undoubtedly continue to find new and different venues to help organizations, groups of people and individuals resolve differences and work together more peacefully.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{conflict}} within families in Normandy, c. 1025 to 1135. Despite {{the occurrence of}} several acute struggles within the ducal house during this period, {{and a number of}} lesser known but significant disputes within aristocratic families, this topic has attracted little attention from historians. Kin conflict was cast by medieval commentators as a paradox, and indeed, it is often still regarded in these terms today: the family was a bastion of solidarity, and its members the very individuals to whom one turned for support {{in the face of an}} external threat, so for a family group to turn against itself was aberrant and abhorrent. In this thesis, I draw on significant narrative and documentary evidence to consider the practice and perception of family discord. When considered in its broader setting, it emerges that kin disputes were an expected and accepted part of Norman society at this time. I begin by introducing the topic, justifying my approach, considering the relevant historiography, and providing an overview of the sources. In chapter one, I examine the representations of family and conflict in a range of primary sources to glean contemporary views. In chapters two and three, I focus on <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> within the ducal family, considering the causes of disputes, and then the place of internal ducal dissension in the Norman world. Chapter four analyses the same issues in relation to discord within aristocratic families, before chapter five explores family disputes which arose from patronage of the Church. In the conclusion, I consider the Norman example within its comparative contemporary milieu and ponder the broader themes of family conflict...|$|E

On January 24, 1988, another scheduling conflict took place between the WWF and NWA: the NWA presented the Bunkhouse Stampede on PPV, while WWF aired the Royal Rumble for free on the USA Network. Later that year, with WWF's WrestleMania IV around the corner, Crockett decided to use McMahon's own tactics against him, developing his own PPV-caliber event and airing it for free on TBS opposite WrestleMania. The result was the Clash of the Champions. On March 27, 1988 - the same night as WrestleMania IV - the first Clash of the Champions aired.

40|$|The recent {{political}} conflict in Zimbabwe has {{attracted the attention}} of policymakers, academics and the media alike in the neighbouring countries of the region, across the African continent and internationally. While the story of an ageing African liberation hero turned dictator who, through autocratic rule, has governed his country and his people to the ground in order to maintain power is captivating, a key element of the fascination is the critical diplomatic role played by South Africa from 2000 onward. Foreign policy in post-apartheid South Africa on paper is driven by human rights and democracy, conflict prevention and conflict resolution through peaceful means, and the promotion of African interests in world affairs. However, after observing South Africa’s involvement in the Zimbabwe conflict between 2000 and 2009, South Africa’s foreign policy appears to be propelled more by African solidarity and sovereignty, anti-imperialism, and a softer interpretation of preventive diplomacy than its international counterparts. Thabo Mbeki’s preventive diplomacy toward Zimbabwe during his presidency was slow to produce results, lacked transparency and frustrated many, yet, when examined under a preventive diplomacy theoretical lens, Mbeki’s policy did eventually garner success through the signing of the Global Political Agreement (GPA) and the formation of an inclusive government in Zimbabwe. This dissertation examines the role of preventive diplomacy in South Africa’s foreign policy toward Zimbabwe under Mbeki’s leadership and determines the point at which South Africa switched from an approach of preventive diplomacy to one of conflict resolution and conflict management. The concept of ‘preventive diplomacy’ is often focused on government-to-government relations or the high level diplomacy of intergovernmental organizations such as the United Nations (UN). Multi-track diplomacy expands on this traditional interpretation and considers the preventive diplomacy contributions of a variety of non-state actors to <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> prevention. This dissertation uniquely moulds the preventive diplomacy theoretical framework of Michael Lund with Kumar Rupesinghe’s concept of multi-track diplomacy to form a more comprehensive illustration of the role of preventive diplomacy in the approach of multiple actors towards the Zimbabwe conflict. The more inclusive preventive diplomacy theoretical framework is then applied to the conflict in Zimbabwe between 2000 and 2009. Through the application of a preventive diplomacy framework which incorporates the concept of multi-track diplomacy it is then possible to observe the South African government’s preventive diplomacy approach toward Zimbabwe first between 2000 and 2007 and then as mandated by SADC between 2007 and 2009 and finally compare it with the diplomacy of multi-track actors such as the UN, Zimbabwe-based and South African-based civil society organizations, the Zimbabwean Diaspora, religious groups, and financial institutions. The examination of the larger role of preventive diplomacy in the Zimbabwe conflict situation leads to the understanding that each diplomatic effort is interlinked. Therefore the culminating event of the South African government’s preventive diplomacy approach in the Global Political Agreement could not have been achieved without the preventive diplomacy efforts of a multitude of actors who were also committed to preventing violence and finding a lasting solution to the conflict in Zimbabwe.

40|$|The {{research}} {{intends to}} offer the perspective of an organic study {{of the history of}} production, union trades and society in River Weser shipyards, which raised and developed around the city of Bremen. The selected time span is the decade going from the outbreak of World War I and the ultimate post-inflationary stabilization in 1924.

40|$|This book {{deals with}} one of the most {{important}} issues of philosophy of law and constitutional thought: how to understand clashes of fundamental rights, such as the conflict between free speech and privacy. The main argument of this book is that much can be learned about the nature of fundamental legal rights by examining them through the lens <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> among such rights, and criticizing the views of scholars and jurists who have discussed both fundamental legal rights and the nature <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> among them. Theories of rights are necessarily abstract, aiming at providing the best possible answers to pressing social problems. Yet such theories must also respond to the real and changing dilemmas of the day. Taking up the problem <b>of</b> <b>conflicting</b> rights, Zucca seeks a theory of rights that can guide us to a richer, more responsive approach to rights discourse. The idea of constitutional rights is one of the most powerful tools to advance justice in the Western tradition. But as this book demonstrates, even the most ambitious theory of rights cannot satisfactorily address questions <b>of</b> <b>conflicting</b> rights. How, for instance, can we fully secure privacy when it clashes with free speech? To what extent can our societies assist people in dying without compromising the protection of life? Exploring the limitations of the rights discourse in these areas, Zucca questions the role of law in settling ethical dilemmas helping to clarify thinking about the limitations of rights discourse.

While mediation is perceived as a conflictological concept and is more widely used in dispute settlement and resolution, a new interdisciplinary field of theoretical knowledge with its own conceptual framework as well as a new professional and practical field are beginning to form both in Russia and in other countries. As theoretical and practical aspects of innovation in mediation require consolidation not only for its national development but also for the guaranteed international cooperation, the article touches upon some of the particular theoretical issues of the topic in question: terminological consistency, consolidation of the system of mediation principles, the phenomenon of juridisation of mediation and its limits. ...|$|R

40|$|This book explores what {{it means}} to be Lihirian through an {{analysis}} of everyday life in the Lihir Islands, Papua New Guinea. Atop four volcanic islands in the Pacific Ocean east of New Ireland, Lihirians are living in a world that has rapidly changed in the last century through the work of Christian missions, government administration and the development of a large gold mine (Lihir Gold Ltd). Being Lihirian in the context of these changes is challenging, yet Lihirians retain a strong sense of themselves and their islands as distinctive. This book aims to reconcile what has been termed the ‘root metaphor’ of Melanesian sociality as based on relational or composite personhood with the strong individualist tendencies and sense of self that are found in everyday practice in Lihir. In looking beyond the ideals of moral conduct to <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> relations and emotion, it can be seen that the symbolism of Melanesian sociality does not encompass the practical reality of {{what it means}} to be Lihirian. Emotion is a ubiquitous part of life in Lihir. Emotions are motivations, reactions and remarks on the state of self and other; in short, emotions are integral to relations and persons in Lihir. This book considers emotions both through their performative contexts as well as the more usual lexical analyses of emotion terms and commentaries. In moving beyond lexical analyses, Hemer argues that the strong focus on the semantics of emotion in anthropology has been at the expense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> embodied <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> emotion that was apparent in Lihir. Through this engaging ethnographic account <b>of</b> connections, <b>conflicts</b> and loss in Lihir, Hemer’s own fieldwork journey of making relationships, experiencing disputes and finally leaving the field, is mirrored. Structured into three parts, the book works through the complexities of creating and sustaining relationships, the evaluation of conduct as moral and <b>the</b> <b>practices</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict,</b> and <b>the</b> experiences and transformations of death and grief. Throughout these parts various emotions are highlighted and interrogated for their relationship to psychological understandings and definitions: love, anger, jealousy, sadness. Emotions are also understood in a historical context and as connected to social changes wrought by interactions with global phenomena such as religion. Susan R Heme...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{situated}} {{at the intersection of}} Feminist International Relations, Critical Security Studies and Gender Studies. It takes as its starting point – and offers a challenge to – the feminist contention that soldiers cannot be peacekeepers due to hegemonic constructions of military masculinity associated with <b>the</b> skills and <b>practices</b> <b>of</b> combat. It problematises this assumption by investigating whether involvement in <b>the</b> <b>practices</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> resolution on Peace Support Operations (PSOs) influences the construction of military masculinities. The thesis also questions the rather monolithic accounts of masculinity which are found in feminist arguments that peacekeeping soldiers reinforce neo-imperial oppression, and argues that such critiques neglect the potentially more progressive aspects of employing soldiers as peacekeepers. Using the British Army as a case study to explore these conceptual issues, the thesis utilises a novel methodological approach derived from R W Connell’s framework of gender relations and social constructivist discourse theory. It analyses both official and unofficial sources of British Army discourse on PSOs, including military doctrine, recruitment material and autobiography, and finds evidence to suggest that ‘peacekeeper masculinity’ offers a challenge, albeit incomplete, to the hegemonic masculinity associated with combat. The thesis argues that, despite the limited nature of this challenge, peacekeeper masculinity represents an important development because <b>the</b> privileging <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> resolution <b>practices</b> it embodies involves disruptions to traditional gendered dichotomies and the construction of ‘regendered soldiers,’ with important implications for both international peace and security and gender relations. Finding conflict resolution practices such as negotiating and building consent, moderating the use of force and humanitarian activities manly rather than emasculating is crucial if soldiers are to take PSOs as seriously as they do war. Moreover, associating masculinity with practices that require building relations of sensitivity, mutual respect and empathy has implications beyond the success of PSOs. Such associations not only challenge current models of hegemonic masculinity in the military, but – through replacing relations of dominance with more democratic relations – challenge the entire hierarchical structure of gender relations in western culture and language. As such, in exploring the concept of regendered soldiers, this thesis contributes significantly to theories of change in gender relations as well as to feminist International Relations scholarship on military masculinities, peacekeeping and security...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{evolutions}} in <b>the</b> <b>practices</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> management {{have brought}} the topic of inter-organizational co-operation under renewed attention (Balas, 2009; Biermann, 2008). One {{of the most important}} trend deals with the configuration of co-operation that has become more complex than what has been first described in the Chapter VIII of the UN Charter and the 1992 Agenda for Peace, or, more recently, by Bah and Jones (2008). Such complexity calls into question classical views on inter-organizational co-operation that have, so far, presented inter-organizational co-operation (IOC) as a static, dyadic and ad hoc phenomenon. This contribution challenges this approach. The purpose is to present a new framework for the analysis of IOC where the social network perspective (SNA) helps to better understand the dynamics of co-operation between international organizations. Most of the recent studies have examined IOC at the dyadic level and exclusively in the framework of peace operations. Instead, inter-organizational co-operation is designed as a dynamic and integrated process with three main features : a) inter-organizational co-operation can be studied as a network; b) inter-organizational cooperation occurs at the inter-agency level; b) the cooperation between conflict managers encompasses all the types of co-operation (from diplomatic cooperation to operational cooperation) that occur during peace processes. Based on the analysis of the interactions among the agencies of the European Union (EU), of the Council of Europe (CoE), of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and of the United Nations (UN) in the case of South-Ossetia (Georgia), this article will shed light on the functionning of these complex inter-organizational systems. The main argument is that <b>practices</b> <b>of</b> co-operation between international organizations have significantly evolved since the beginning <b>of</b> the <b>conflict</b> in the 90 s, going from a sporadic and non-cohesive network to denser and poly-centric network. Such evolution underlines that conflict management has turned to be both a collective action implemented to forster collaborative advantage {{at the level of the}} whole system of action, and an organizational strategy set up to strenghten structural power (centrality) at the level of each organization. The first part of the paper is dedicated to the explanation of the theoretical and methodological framework of analysis using the new Database on Inter-Organizational Relations in Conflicts. The second part presents the results obtained using a Social Network Analysis. Special attention will be given to the discussion of the inter-organizational system's structural properties. The last part proposes some future directions for research on inter-organisational system...|$|R

This study shows that conflict reporting in the Nigerian press is ‘episodic’, featuring such conflict behaviours as the bombing of drilling platforms and oil pipelines, killing and maiming of oil workers and state security operatives, and kidnapping and hostage taking, which are the focus of this study. Framing <b>of</b> these <b>conflict</b> behaviours is influenced by ethno-political factors, foreign policy implications, and the height of drama of the situation. Drawing data from three national daily newspapers – The Punch, the Daily Champion and the New Nigerian – this work shows that the reporting by The Punch and the Daily Champion indicated ‘support framing’ of the Niger Delta, while the New Nigerian showed ‘distance framing’. The press, however, needs to reverse <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> ‘describing’ <b>conflict</b> situations through straight news stories and to focus on more analysis-based features and editorials that ‘prescribe’ solutions...|$|R

40|$|Extract] This {{special issue}} of Environmental Education Research revisits {{arguments}} offered twenty years ago about the then‐documented gap between the rhetoric and philosophy of environmental education and <b>the</b> reality <b>of</b> <b>practices</b> in K– 12 schooling. In Stevenson (1987), which is reproduced here as the first article, I argued that this gap should be expected given the traditional purposes and structures of schooling in western industrialised societies. In particular, I {{pointed out that the}} ideals expressed in international policy documents at the time for <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> environmental education <b>conflicted</b> with the dominant curriculum and pedagogical <b>practices</b> <b>of</b> information transmission and the assimilation of unproblematic factual knowledge in schools. I offered an explanation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dominant <b>practices</b> in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historical purpose of schools, their structural organisation, the primacy of demands on teachers to maintain order and control, and teachers' ideological suppositions about knowledge, teaching and learning...|$|R
