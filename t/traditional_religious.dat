5|$|As well as celebrating {{many of the}} <b>traditional</b> <b>religious</b> festivals of Great Britain, such as Easter and Christmas, Wales has its {{own unique}} celebratory days. An early festivity was Mabsant, when local parishes would {{celebrate}} {{the patron saint of}} their local church. This celebration died out in the 19th century, to be replaced by Saint David's Day, which is celebrated on 1 March throughout Wales, and by Welsh expats around the world.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the first}} century AD, the Coptic {{alphabet}} started to be used alongside the Demotic script. Coptic is a modified Greek alphabet {{with the addition of}} some Demotic signs. Although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the fourth century, towards the end only a small handful of priests could still read them. As the <b>traditional</b> <b>religious</b> establishments were disbanded, knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was mostly lost. Attempts to decipher them date to the Byzantine and Islamic periods in Egypt, but only in 1822, after the discovery of the Rosetta stone and years of research by Thomas Young and Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion, were hieroglyphs almost fully deciphered.|$|E
5|$|In August and September, Edward and Simpson cruised the Eastern Mediterranean on {{the steam}} yacht Nahlin. By October it was {{becoming}} clear that the new king planned to marry Simpson, especially when divorce proceedings between the Simpsons were brought at Ipswich Assizes. Preparations for all contingencies were made, including {{the prospect of the}} coronation of King Edward and Queen Wallis. Because of the religious implications of any marriage, plans were made to hold a secular coronation ceremony, not in the <b>traditional</b> <b>religious</b> location of Westminster Abbey, but in the Banqueting House in Whitehall.|$|E

5|$|Spiritualism {{appealed to}} many educated Victorians {{who no longer}} found <b>traditional</b> <b>religious</b> doctrine, {{such as that of}} the Church of England, {{acceptable}} yet were unsatisfied with the completely materialistic and mechanical view of the world that was increasingly emerging from 19th-century science. However, several scholars who have researched Wallace's views in depth have emphasised that, for him, spiritualism was a matter of science and philosophy rather than religious belief. Among other prominent 19th-century intellectuals involved with spiritualism were the social reformer Robert Owen, who was one of Wallace's early idols, the physicists William Crookes and Lord Rayleigh, the mathematician Augustus De Morgan, and the Scottish publisher Robert Chambers.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{literary}} critics Maman S. Mahayana, Oyon Sofyan, and Achmad Dian, Hasan's psychological struggles reflect Sigmund Freud's theories on psychoanalysis. Teeuw notes that Hasan {{comes across as}} being disappointed that his <b>traditional</b> <b>religious</b> upbringing {{is not enough to}} overcome the temptations of the modern world. Poet and critic of Indonesian literature Muhammad Balfas writes that Hasan's conflict arises from being torn intellectually between the teachings of his ultra-religious father and the Marxist Rusli, {{while at the same time}} being emotionally victimised by the ever self-confident Anwar. Balfas notes that three versions of Hasan are made apparent to the reader: Hasan's view of himself, the narrator's view of Hasan, and the narrator's reconstruction of Hasan.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the many}} ethnic sub-groups in Madagascar adhere to their own set of beliefs, {{practices}} and ways of life that have historically contributed to their unique identities. However, {{there are a number}} of core cultural features that are common throughout the island, creating a strongly unified Malagasy cultural identity. In addition to a common language and shared <b>traditional</b> <b>religious</b> beliefs around a creator god and veneration of the ancestors, the traditional Malagasy worldview is shaped by values that emphasize fihavanana (solidarity), vintana (destiny), tody (karma), and hasina, a sacred life force that traditional communities believe imbues and thereby legitimates authority figures within the community or family. Other cultural elements commonly found throughout the island include the practice of male circumcision; strong kinship ties; a widespread belief in the power of magic, diviners, astrology and witch doctors; and a traditional division of social classes into nobles, commoners, and slaves.|$|E

5|$|Sarawak is {{the only}} state in Malaysia where Christians outnumber Muslims. The {{earliest}} Christian missionaries in Sarawak were Church of England (Anglicans) in 1848, followed by Roman Catholics a few years later, and Methodists in 1903. Evangelizing first took place among the Chinese immigrants before spreading to indigenous animists. Other Christian denominations in Sarawak are Borneo Evangelical Mission (or Sidang Injil Borneo), and Baptists. Indigenous people such as the Iban, Bidayuh, and Orang Ulu have adopted Christianity although they do retain some of their <b>traditional</b> <b>religious</b> rites. Many Muslims come from the Malay, Melanau, and Kayan ethnic groups. Buddhism, Taoism, and Chinese folk religion are predominantly practised by Chinese Malaysians. Other minor religions in Sarawak are Baha'i, Hinduism, Sikhism, and animism.|$|E
5|$|The Christian {{conversion}} of the Merina royal court in 1869 spurred the arrival of Merina missionaries in Sihanaka country and the {{conversion of}} {{a significant portion of}} the population. Following the French capture of the Merina capital in 1895, Christianity was largely abandoned in Sihanaka and <b>traditional</b> <b>religious</b> beliefs regained preeminence; at least one major historic church in the area was burned. French Catholic missionaries arrived in the area around 1900 and gradually began converting members of local communities. This was soon followed by a renewed effort on the part of Protestant missionaries, leading to further conversions. Today, traditional beliefs remain strong among the Sihanaka, although a growing number practice orthodox Christianity or a syncretic form that incorporates aspects of traditional respect for ancestors and their norms.|$|E
5|$|Early Philippine {{sculpture}} {{is characterized}} by frontal nudity. One of the earliest forms are the bulols by the Ifugao people which serve as an assurance for bountiful harvests. The original function of these sculptures {{are related to the}} ceremonies and beliefs of the tribes who created them. Arab and Russian missionaries also brought beveled type of carvings in the form of Okkil. The beginnings of this sculpture type started with the Islamization of Sulu. The Spanish colonization of the country did not hinder Filipinos creating sculptures for objects of adoration. During this time, sculptures of deities and saints were used to teach Filipinos Christian doctrines. During the American colonialism, worshippers of faith were not discouraged to sculpt in order to adorn churches. Filipinos' first exposure to painting happened when Spain conquered the Philippines and these were used as religious propaganda often displayed in churches. However, as education progressed and wealth increased, more and more artists started to shift from the <b>traditional</b> <b>religious</b> motifs to a more secular pattern of imagery.|$|E

5|$|The {{primary source}} of {{information}} about the reign of Andrianampoinimerina is Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara, a Malagasy language book relating the oral history of the Merina kings as collected by a Jesuit missionary, Francois Callet, in the late 19th century. Prior to the eventual release of a French language translation in the 1950s, references to the king in academic and popular writing during the colonial period de-emphasized his role as a conduit of <b>traditional</b> <b>religious</b> power and authority, instead glorifying his administrative practices in an attempt to bring greater credibility to the colonial government as a vehicle for building upon and strengthening the principles of good governance that he introduced. Beginning in the 1970s, historians began to focus more on the spiritual aspects of his role as king, and researchers questioned and compared sources in an effort to arrive at a more factual and balanced history of Andrianampoinimerina and his reign.|$|E
