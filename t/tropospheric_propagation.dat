50|$|Tropospheric {{propagated}} signals {{travel in}} the part of the atmosphere adjacent to the surface and extending to some 25,000 feet (7,620 m). Such signals are thus directly affected by weather conditions extending over some hundreds of miles. During very settled, warm anticyclonic weather (i.e., high pressure), usually weak signals from distant transmitters improve in strength. Another symptom during such conditions may be interference to the local transmitter resulting in co-channel interference, usually horizontal lines or an extra floating picture with analog broadcasts and break-up with digital broadcasts. A settled high-pressure system gives the characteristic conditions for enhanced <b>tropospheric</b> <b>propagation,</b> in particular favouring signals which travel along the prevailing isobar pattern (rather than across it).

LoRa technology operating in sub-GHz frequency bands implements these wireless links with minimal power consumption.

In this paper, an experimental wireless link from a mobile vehicle which transmits sensor data to a base station is measured and analyzed in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and packet loss. These measurements confirm the usefulness of LoRa technology for wireless sensor systems in polar regions. By deploying directional antennas at the base station, a range of up to 30 km is covered in case of Line-of-Sight radio propagation in both the 434 and 868 MHz bands.

The standard PWE is very suitable for marching-type numerical solutions. The one-way Fourier split-step parabolic equation algorithm (SSPE) is highly effective in modeling electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation above the Earth's irregular surface through inhomogeneous atmosphere [1 - 4]. The two drawbacks of the standard PWE are: (i) It handles only the forward-propagating waves, and cannot account for the backscattered ones. The forward waves are usually adequate for typical long-range propagation scenarios. However, the backward waves become significant in the presence of obstacles that redirect the incoming wave. Hence, this necessitates the accurate estimation of the multipath effects to model the <b>tropospheric</b> wave <b>propagation</b> over terrain. (ii) It is a narrow-angle approximation, which consequently restricts the accuracy to propagation angles up to 10 °- 15 ° from the paraxial direction. To handle propagation angles beyond these values, wide-angle propagators have been introduced [5 - 6]...|$|R

While San Diego and Los Angeles are not close enough that one city's stations can be seen clearly over {{the air in the}} other, the unique geography of Southern California results in <b>tropospheric</b> <b>propagation.</b> This phenomenon makes co-channel interference a significant enough problem that the two cities must share the VHF band.|$|E

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{satellite}} communication for global coverage has apparently indicated {{a renewed interest}} in the studies of radio wave propagation through the atmosphere, in the VHF, UHF and microwave bands. The extensive measurements of atmosphere constituents, dynamics and radio meterological parameters during the Middle Atmosphere Program (MAP) have opened up further the possibilities of studying <b>tropospheric</b> radio wave <b>propagation</b> parameters, relevant to Earth/space link design. The three basic parameters of significance to radio propagation are thermal emission, absorption and group delay of the atmosphere, all of which are controlled largely by the water vapor content in the atmosphere, particular at microwave bands. As good emitters are also good absorbers, the atmospheric emission as well as the absorption attains a maximum at the frequency of 22. 235 GHz, which is the peak of the water vapor line. The group delay is practically independent of frequency in the VHF, UHF and microwave bands. However, all three parameters exhibit a similar seasonal dependence originating presumably from the seasonal dependence of the water vapor content.

Variations of <b>tropospheric</b> and ionospheric <b>propagation</b> delays limit the accuracy of all such measurements. We are investigating the extent of this limitation, using data from the Shuttle radar flight, SIR-C, which is sensitive to the troposphere, and the Earth Resources Satellites, ERS- 1 / 2, which are sensitive to both the troposphere and the ionosphere. We are presently gathering statistics of the delay variations over selected, diverse areas to determine the best accuracy possible for repeat track interferometry. The phases of an interferogram depend on both the topography of the scene and variations in propagation delay. The delay variations can be caused by movement of elements in the scene, by changes in tropospheric water vapor and by changes of the charge concentrations in the ionosphere. We plan to separate these causes by using the data from a third satellite visit (three-pass interferometry). The figure gives the geometry of the three-pass observations. The page of the figure is taken to be perpendicular to the spacecraft orbits. The three observational locations are marked on the figure, giving baselines B- 12 and B- 13, separated by the angle alpha. These parameters are almost constant over the whole scene.

40|$|A {{methodology}} for identifying equatorial waves {{is used to}} analyze the multilevel 40 -yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA- 40) data for two different years (1992 and 1993) to investigate the behavior of the equatorial waves under opposite phases of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). A comprehensive view of 3 D structures and of zonal and vertical propagation of equatorial Kelvin, westward-moving mixed Rossby–gravity (WMRG), and n = 1 Rossby (R 1) waves in different QBO phases is presented. Consistent with expectation based on theory, upward-propagating Kelvin waves occur more frequently during the easterly QBO phase than during the westerly QBO phase. However, the westward-moving WMRG and R 1 waves show the opposite behavior. The presence of vertically propagating equatorial waves in the stratosphere also depends on the upper tropospheric winds and <b>tropospheric</b> forcing. Typical <b>propagation</b> parameters such as the zonal wavenumber, zonal phase speed, period, vertical wavelength, and vertical group velocity are found. In general, waves in the lower stratosphere have a smaller zonal wavenumber, shorter period, faster phase speed, and shorter vertical wavelength than those in the upper troposphere. All of the waves in the lower stratosphere show an upward group velocity and downward phase speed. When the phase of the QBO is not favorable for waves to propagate, their phase speed in the lower stratosphere is larger and their period is shorter than in the favorable phase, suggesting Doppler shifting by the ambient flow and a filtering of the slow waves. Tropospheric WMRG and R 1 waves in the Western Hemisphere also show upward phase speed and downward group velocity, with an indication of their forcing from middle latitudes. Although the waves observed in the lower stratosphere are dominated by “free” waves, there is evidence of some connection with previous tropical convection in the favorable year for the Kelvin waves in the warm water hemisphere and WMRG and R 1 waves in the Western Hemisphere, which is suggestive of the importance of convective forcing for the existence of propagating coupled Kelvin waves and midlatitude forcing for the existence of coupled WMRG and R 1 waves...|$|R

40|$|Planetary {{spacecraft}} {{are viewed}} through a troposphere that absorbs and delays radio signals propagating through it. Tropospheric water, {{in the form}} of vapor, cloud liquid, and precipitation, emits radio noise which limits satellite telemetry communication link performance. Even at X-band, rain storms have severely affected several satellite experiments including a planetary encounter. The problem will worsen with DSN implementation of Ka-band because communication link budgets will be dominated by <b>tropospheric</b> conditions. Troposphere-induced <b>propagation</b> delays currently limit VLBI accuracy and are significant sources of error for Doppler tracking. Additionally, the success of radio science programs such as satellite gravity wave experiments and atmospheric occultation experiments depends on minimizing the effect of water vapor-induced propagation delays. In order to overcome limitations imposed by the troposphere, the Deep Space Network has supported a program of radiometric remote sensing. Currently, water vapor radiometers (WVRs) and microwave temperature profilers (MTPs) support many aspects of the Deep Space Network operations and research and development programs. Their capability to sense atmospheric water, microwave sky brightness, and atmospheric temperature is critical to development of Ka-band telemetry systems, communication link models, VLBI, satellite gravity wave experiments, and radio science missions. During 1993, WVRs provided data for propagation model development, supported planetary missions, and demonstrated advanced tracking capability. Collection of atmospheric statistics is necessary to model and predict performance of Ka-band telemetry links, antenna arrays, and radio science experiments. Since the spectrum of weather variations has power at very long time scales, atmospheric measurements have been requested for periods ranging from one year to a decade at each DSN site. The resulting database would provide reliable statistics on daily, monthly, and seasonal variations. Only long-term monitoring will prevent biases from being introduced by an exceptionally wet or dry year. Support for planetary missions included tropospheric calibration for the recent Mars Observer gravity wave experiments and Ka-band link experiment (KaBLE). Additionally, several proposed radio science experiments such as profiling planetary atmospheres using satellite occultations and Ka-band gravitational wave searches require advanced radiometer technology development. Finally, there has been a consistent advanced technology program to advance satellite navigational and tracking capabilities.

Also, the equipment used {{to pick up the}} off-air signal from CFTO would relay the video from another station broadcasting on VHF channel 9 instead—such as WNYS-TV in Syracuse or WWTV in Cadillac, Michigan—due to <b>tropospheric</b> <b>propagation</b> overwhelming CFTO's signal. Often, when CFTO programming actually was being rebroadcast, the station switcher failed to drop CFTO's identification to display the WNYP-TV call letters, which was considered a violation of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules. Inexplicably, the audio line from a Jamestown radio station could sometimes be heard in the background when CTV programming was airing. Paxson also earned significant animus for airing programming from CHCH-TV and CBC Television's CBLT without permission. It had been legal to broadcast foreign programming in the United States without permission as a result of laws passed during World War II. However, the programs' copyright owners believed Paxson was breaking the law by broadcasting their shows, and took legal action against him.|$|E
