This {{can be a}} valid way of forecasting the weather when {{it is in a}} steady state, such as during the summer season in the tropics. <b>This</b> <b>method</b> of forecasting strongly depends upon the presence of a stagnant weather pattern. Therefore, when in a fluctuating weather pattern, <b>this</b> <b>method</b> of forecasting becomes inaccurate. It can be useful in both short range forecasts and long range forecasts.|$|E
