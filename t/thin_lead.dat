Here we demonstrate a suspended two-wire plasmonic nanoantenna acting like a nanoelectrometer. The antenna wires are supported and electrically connected via <b>thin</b> <b>leads</b> without disturbing the antenna resonance. As a voltage is applied, equal charges are induced on both antenna wires. The resulting equilibrium between the repulsive Coulomb force and the restoring elastic bending force enables us to precisely control the gap size.

Our experiments highlight the potential to realize large bandwidth optical nanoelectromechanical systems...|$|R
30|$|Non-Newtonian polymer {{flooding}} aims {{to increase}} the viscosity of the displacing phase thereby decreasing the mobility factor and reducing the formation of viscous fingers (Wei et al. 2014).

30|$|It can be {{concluded}} that for both varieties, early defoliation and cluster <b>thinning</b> <b>lead</b> to better soluble solids accumulation than in the control set. The treatments lead to raised concentration of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins in both varieties.

This {{is followed by the}} treatment where only defoliation was applied. The enhanced contents of these compounds per berry in grape variety Vranac are the result of increased synthesis, while in Cabernet sauvignon variety, increased content was due to the less berry weight. The best wine characteristics (alcohol, color intensity, color hue, total anthocyanins, total polyphenols) were found in products, where defoliation was applied.|$|R

We work in terms of two, somewhat different, thinning models. The main model is based on the usual thinning notion of deleting points independently according to probabilities supplied by a random field. In Section 4, however, we use an alternative thinning model, which can be more straightforward to apply if the thinning is determined by point interactions. ...|$|R
