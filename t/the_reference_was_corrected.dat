Neuronal membrane potentials fluctuate stochastically due to conductance changes caused by random transitions between the open and closed states of ion channels. Although it has previously been shown that channel noise can nontrivially affect neuronal dynamics, it is unknown whether ion-channel noise {{is strong enough to}} act as a noise source for hypothesized noise-enhanced information processing in real neuronal systems, i. e., "stochastic facilitation". Here we demonstrate that biophysical models of channel noise can give rise to two kinds of recently discovered stochastic facilitation effects in a Hodgkin-Huxley-like model of auditory brainstem neurons. The first, known as slope-based stochastic resonance (SBSR), enables phasic neurons to emit action potentials that can encode the slope of inputs that vary slowly relative to key time constants in the model. The second, known as inverse stochastic resonance (ISR), occurs in tonically firing neurons when small levels of noise inhibit tonic firing and replace it with burstlike dynamics. Consistent with previous work, we conclude that channel noise can provide significant variability in firing dynamics, even for large numbers of channels. Moreover, our results show that possible associated computational benefits may occur due to channel noise in neurons of the auditory brainstem. This holds whether the firing dynamics in the model are phasic (SBSR can occur due to channel noise) or tonic (ISR can occur due to channel noise). Brett A. Schmerl and Mark D. McDonnel...|$|R

40|$|Late X-ray flares {{observed}} in X-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) suggest late central engine activities {{at a few}} minuets to hours after the burst. A few unambiguously confirmed cases of supernova associations with nearby long GRBs imply that an accompanying supernova-like component might be a common feature in all long GRB events. These motivate us to study the interactions of a late jet, responsible for a x-ray flare, with various components in a stellar explosion, responsible for a GRB. These components include a supernova shell-like ejecta, and a cocoon that was produced when the main jet producing the GRB itself was propagating through the progenitor star. We find that {{the interaction between the}} late jet and the supernova ejecta may produce a luminous (up to 10 ^ 49 erg s^- 1) thermal X-ray transient lasting for 10 s. The interaction between the late jet and the cocoon produces synchrotron self-absorbed non-thermal emission, with the observed peak X-ray flux density from 0. 001 micro Jy to 1 mJy at 1 keV and a peak optical flux density from 0. 01 micro Jy to 0. 1 Jy (for a redshift z= 2). The light curve due to the late jet - cocoon interaction has very small pulse-width-to-time ratio, Δ t / t ≈ 0. 01 - 0. 5, where t is the pulse peak time since the burst trigger. Identifying these features in current and future observations would open a new frontier in the study of GRB progenitor stars.

Sensitivities for Plasmodium vivax (n[*]=[*] 70), Plasmodium ovale (n[*]=[*] 69) and Plasmodium malariae (n[*]=[*] 16) were 74. 3 %, 31. 9 % and 25. 0 % respectively. Wrong species identification occurred in 10 (2. 5 %) samples and was mainly due to P. vivax samples reacting with the Pf-pLDH test line.

Setting – Large public libraries in the United States and Canada. Subjects – Telephone <b>reference</b> staff of <b>the</b> 25 largest public libraries in the United States and Canada. Methods – The 2005 World Book Almanac {{was used to}} select the 25 largest (in terms of population served) public libraries in Canada and the United States. Each system’s Web site was checked to locate the telephone number for reference service. For some systems {{it was necessary to}} call the general telephone number for the main library or the first branch listed on the Web site. Five ready <b>reference</b> test questions <b>were</b> developed from a list of questions that students in a graduate library and information science course had previously asked of public library telephone <b>reference</b> services. <b>The</b> selected questions in the order that they were asked were: 1. Can you tell me when Valentine’s Day is? 2. Who is the current governor/premier (of the state/province where the library is located) ? 3. What is the population of Montana? 4. In which state is the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) located? 5. What is the French word for “chiropractor”? The authors called each of the 25 libraries during five consecutive weeks at different times of the business day. Each week, one question was asked; once an answer was received, no clarification was requested and the call was ended. The study reports the results of 125 reference transactions. For this study, the following definitions were used to assess complete citation for each type of information resource: • For a Web site – the complete URL (title and sponsor of the site not required). • For a digital database – the database title and the title and year of the specific item (author, publisher, page number not required). • For a print resource – the title and year (author, edition, page number, publisher and place of publication not required). Each <b>reference</b> transaction <b>was</b> noted to record whether the answer <b>was</b> <b>correct</b> and to define the nature of source citing that occurred. Other notes were kept to describe other respondent behaviors and attitudes demonstrated during the transaction. Main Results – 93. 6 % of the answers to <b>the</b> 125 <b>reference</b> questions <b>were</b> <b>correct.</b> Complete citations <b>were</b> provided seventimes (5. 6 %) and partial citations were provided an additional thirty-one times (24. 8 %). In 68 % of the 125 transactions, no source citation information was provided. There was a corresponding relationship between the difficulty of <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> question and <b>the</b> respondent’s provision of any citation source (either a complete or incomplete citation source). Sources were generally not provided for simple questions even though the practice of citing is expected for all levels of questions. The practice of citing in order to reveal the path to the answer so that the user may become independent in the future was not observed. In addition, five “negative closure” techniques were employed by respondents. These included unmonitored referral; immediate referral away from the service; articulating that the encounter would not be successful at the start; shutting down the transaction either by tone of voice or by use of phrase that precluded any further interaction with the user; or claiming that the information did not exist or was not available. A reliance on digital formats rather than print sources was found. Conclusion – The accuracy rate of the answers to the questions was very high (93. 6 %), but other aspects of the service were considered to be less than satisfactory. <b>The</b> <b>Reference</b> and User Services Association (RUSA) Guidelines, considered the best practices for <b>reference</b> service, <b>were</b> not observed and in particular, the source citation rule was not followed...|$|R
