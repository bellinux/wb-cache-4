He had a first cut of the film already, and when I saw that I was really interested and wanted to do it. So I left another film to do this one. I made time for it".|$|E
500|$|Miller {{described}} his biggest challenge in writing Rivens music as reconciling the linear, pleasing construction of music with the nonlinearity of the gameplay. As players can freely explore all areas, Miller explained in an interview, [...] "the music can't say anything too specific. If it says something, if it builds in intensity and there starts to be a climax, {{and people are}} just standing in a room looking around, and they're thinking 'What's going on in here? Is something about to jump out from behind me?' You can't have the basic parts of music that you'd like <b>to</b> <b>have,</b> <b>you</b> can't have a basic structure. It's all got to be just flowing, and continue to flow." [...] Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine argued that the soundtrack is [...] "appealingly atmospheric", but [...] "lacks definition", and that the music loses impact when separated from the game.|$|E
500|$|In October 1996, {{newspapers}} {{reported that}} BBC bosses had approached Brown about reprising {{her role as}} Dot Cotton and, according to the Daily Mirror, Brown had been in negotiations with EastEnders for several months prior. Brown is quoted by the paper as saying, [...] "I have always been reluctant to go back because I thought Dot's character was not being portrayed properly. I thought it had faded. I always said if Dot comes back it must be as Dot." [...] Brown secured a deal to return and began filming on-location in Gravesend in February 1997. The episode saw Dot's former lodger, Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley), visiting Dot to discover that Nick was once again in prison, leaving Dot alone. Her return episode aired in April 1997. Brown has since revealed that she opted to return to EastEnders to raise her profile again. She had originally only intended to return for a 3-month stint, but was persuaded to stay when a project she {{had been working on}} was cancelled. In July 1997, she commented, [...] "I've decided to stay in EastEnders. They asked me, and in the end I thought: 'Oh well, I might as well.' Everyone, including Barbara Windsor, Wendy Richard and Adam Woodyatt, was saying: 'Don't leave'. And people were coming up in the street saying: 'It's lovely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> back.' Anyway, I find playing the old dear quite fun." [...] After a 5-month break, following Dot being held hostage in her flat by the escaped convict friend of her son, Brown returned to filming in October 1997 on a permanent contract.|$|E

Photography historian Sarah Greenough points out that by doing so Stieglitz [...] "was destabilizing your [...] relationship with nature in order <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> think less about nature, not to deny that it's a photograph of a cloud, but to think more about the feeling that the cloud formation evokes."
