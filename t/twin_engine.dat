5|$|After {{recovering}} {{he took up}} staff duties for a year, until 16 September 1941, when he {{was made}} Staffelkapitän (Squadron leader) of a newly formed night-fighter training unit, 2./Nachtjagdschule 1 (coming out of 2./Zerstörerschule 1). Soon after, on 31 October, Hauptmann (Captain) Specht was promoted to Kommandeur of III./NJS 1. Located at Ingolstadt-Manching, Specht instructed pilots in conversion to night fighting. Paul Zorner, a future night fighter expert, {{was one of his}} students. Leading the Gruppe for exactly one year, this was the last time Specht flew a <b>twin</b> <b>engine</b> aircraft, whereupon he returned to combat duties.|$|E
5|$|British aero engines were {{normally}} {{equipped with}} a power take-off shaft {{that led to the}} rear of the engine. In <b>twin</b> <b>engine</b> aircraft like the Anson, one of these would be used for a generator that powered the aircraft instruments at 24V DC, the other would be left unconnected and available for use. Following a suggestion from Watt to avoid Air Ministry channels, in October Bowen flew one of the Battles to the Metropolitan-Vickers (Metrovick) plant in Sheffield, where he pulled the DC generator off the engine, dropped it on the table, and asked for an AC alternator of similar size and shape. Arnold Tustin, Metrovick's lead engineer, was called in to consider the problem, and after a few minutes he returned to say that he could supply an 80V unit at 1200 to 2400Hz and 800W, even better than the 500W requested. Bowen had an order for 18 pre-production units placed as soon as possible, and the first units started arriving at the end of October. A second order for 400 more quickly followed. Eventually about 133,800 of these alternators would be produced during the war.|$|E
