5|$|In 2004, {{the venue}} was {{upgraded}} for €1 million by installing a K60 inrun between <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> and large hill. This allowed the medium inrun {{to use the}} same outrun as <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> hill. In 2008, a small K25 hill, named Ninoufbakken, was installed slightly away from the main hills. The venue's certificate was due to expire in 2011, after which the venue would have to meet the International Ski Federation's (FIS) latest regulations. A €1.5 million upgrade program was initiated, which saw the inruns renovated, including installation of the Ski-Line track system and new Porsgrund ceramic tracks. The outruns saw new plastic mats and a new sprinkler system. The Nordic House, a sports centre, was also built. Construction started on <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> hill in May 2011 and on the large hill in August 2011, with completion scheduled for early 2012.|$|E

30|$|Kafadar (1988) {{introduced}} <b>the</b> univariate <b>normal</b> slash distribution as {{the resulting}} {{distribution of the}} ratio of a standard normal random variable (rv) and an independent uniform rv (hereafter referred to the distribution as <b>the</b> slash <b>normal).</b> Generalizing <b>the</b> standard <b>normal</b> by introducing a tail parameter, <b>the</b> slash <b>normal</b> has heavier tails than <b>the</b> standard <b>normal,</b> hence {{it could be used}} to simulate and fit heavy tailed data. Wang and Genton (2006) generalized <b>the</b> univariate slash <b>normal</b> to <b>the</b> multivariate slash <b>normal</b> and investigated its properties. They also defined <b>the</b> multivariate skew-slash <b>normal</b> as <b>the</b> resulting distribution of the ratio of a skewed normal rv and an independent uniform rv (hereafter referred to the distribution as <b>the</b> skew-slash <b>normal).</b> They applied it to fit two real datasets.|$|R

30|$|In this article, we {{defined the}} multivariate slash and skew-slash {{distributions}} in a pursuit of providing additional distributions to simulate and fit skewed and heavy tailed data. We investigated the heavy tail behaviors and tractable properties of these distributions which {{are useful in}} simulations and applications to real data. We characterized the skew t, <b>the</b> skew-slash <b>normal</b> and <b>the</b> skew-slash t distributions using both the hidden truncation or selective sampling model and the order statistics {{of the components of}} a bivariate normal or t variable. We demonstrated that the proposed skew-slash t model takes as sub-models the slash t, <b>the</b> slash <b>normal,</b> <b>the</b> skew-slash <b>normal,</b> <b>the</b> skew <b>normal,</b> <b>the</b> skew t and hence <b>the</b> usual <b>normal</b> and t.
