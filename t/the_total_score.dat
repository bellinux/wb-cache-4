If stunts or actions are repeated within a time limit, a score multiplier is earned and repeated actions boost the player's score further. Gameplay {{takes place in}} a single tropical jungle area, {{at the beginning of a}} game the jeep appears in a random location within the jungle. Stunt ramps are set up throughout the game area, along with the hills and valleys these facilitate long-distance jumps and other stunts. Each game takes four minutes, after the timer counts down to zero, <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>score</b> and any bonuses earned are shown. The player's ranking compared to other games played that day and the all-time highscores are also shown. Specific achievements can be gained by players, which are saved to their online profile, though the game can be played as a 'guest', which doesn't require a game profile to be created.|$|E

5|$|Halo 3s {{story or}} {{campaign}} mode {{can be played}} through alone or cooperatively with up to three other players via Xbox Live or System Link. Instead of having each player be an identical character as in previous Halo games, the first player plays as Master Chief, and the second player plays as the Arbiter. The other two players control two Covenant Elites, N'tho 'Sraom and Usze 'Taham, each with their own backstories. No matter which character is played, each player has identical abilities, though their starting weapons vary. Hidden skulls found on each level cause changes to the gameplay when enabled, such as giving the enemies extra health, changing in-game dialogue, or modifying AI behavior. These skulls, {{as well as the}} difficulty level and the speed at which the level is completed, provide multipliers to <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>score.</b> Players are awarded gamerscore points for unlocking Achievements by reaching a certain score in each level.|$|E
5|$|Goat Simulator is an {{open-ended}} third-person perspective {{game in which}} the player controls a goat. The player is free to explore the game's world, a suburban setting, as a goat, and jump, run, bash things, and lick objects. Licking objects attaches the goat's tongue to the object and lets the player drag the object around until they let go. At any time, the player can let the goat drop into a ragdoll model, allowing the game's physics to take over, and another control makes the game run in slow-motion. A number of environmental features allow the player to manipulate the goat into stunts such as bouncing off trampolines or launching the goat into the air through large fans. The game features a scoring system similar to skateboarding games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, whereby doing tricks or other actions earns points, while chaining such tricks together in sequence helps build a multiplier that applies to <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>score</b> of the tricks done in the sequence. Various in-game goals, such as achieving a certain height, completing flips, or destroying certain objects, are given to the player, but the player {{is not required to}} follow these instructions.|$|E

The same rules are followed, but the time limit is extended by five seconds (originally 20, then extended to 25); in addition, if the second contestant duplicates an answer given by the first, a buzzer sounds and he/she must give another answer. If the two contestants reach a combined total of 200 points or more, the family wins the bonus. If not, they are given $5 per point scored as a consolation prize.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{the oral}} {{component}} of the Syllabus B English language examination was incorrectly added to <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>score</b> because of a recent upgrade to the HKEAA computer system, and the supervisor in charge failed to double-check the results. Subsequently, many candidates received an incorrect total score, which resulted in an incorrect final grade for the subject. The problem was so severe that some students wrongfully received an F grade (the second-lowest grade) when {{they were supposed to}} receive an A (the highest grade) in the oral section. Since the final English mark is calculated by averaging the marks in the oral, reading comprehension, listening, and writing sections, having an F in oral would have seriously affected the final English mark if the candidate did well in other components.|$|E
25|$|The score {{achieved}} {{for each}} and every hole of the round or tournament is added to produce <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>score,</b> and the player with the lowest score wins in stroke play. Stroke play is the game most commonly played by professional golfers. If there is a tie after the regulation number of holes in a professional tournament, a playoff takes place between all tied players. Playoffs either are sudden death or employ a pre-determined number of holes, anywhere from three to a full 18. In sudden death, a player who scores lower on a hole than all of his opponents wins the match. If at least two players remain tied after such a playoff using a pre-determined number of holes, then play continues in sudden death format, where {{the first player to}} win a hole wins the tournament.|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{the psychometric properties}} of <b>the</b> <b>total</b> Vaizey <b>score</b> and its individual items. METHODS: The study was conducted as part of a prospective cohort study assessing the outcome of pelvic floor rehabilitation in patients with fecal incontinence. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-four patients were analyzed, 53 of whom provided data on the global perceived effect (GPE) score. Pelvic floor rehabilitation resulted in a significant reduction of <b>the</b> <b>total</b> Vaizey <b>score</b> and most individual items. <b>The</b> <b>total</b> Vaizey <b>scores</b> changed in agreement with <b>the</b> GPE <b>scores.</b> <b>The</b> <b>total</b> Vaizey <b>score</b> was responsive, but some individual items yielded inconsistent results for three different measures. The test-retest reliability was adequate or excellent for six individual items and <b>the</b> <b>total</b> Vaizey <b>score.</b> <b>The</b> internal consistency was low for <b>the</b> <b>total</b> Vaizey <b>score</b> at baseline, in contrast to the follow-up and change scores. The estimates for the minimally important change (MIC) and smallest detectable change yielded moderately consistent results. An MIC of - 5 points seemed preferable and yielded the lowest misclassification rate. CONCLUSIONS: More research is required to confirm conclusions on {{the psychometric properties of}} <b>the</b> <b>total</b> Vaizey <b>score</b> and its individual items, and to justify its use in research and routine clinical practice.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} Baduanjin, a traditional Chinese medical exercise, on improving premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms in women. MethodsForty reproductive age women with PMS in Macau practiced standardized Baduanjin exercise for three menstrual cycles. A questionnaire, the daily record of severity of problems (DRSP), {{was used to measure}} symptom severity. DRSP was filled out every day starting from the last cycle before exercise (i. e., the first menstrual cycle) to the third cycle after exercise initiation (i. e., the fourth menstrual cycle). <b>The</b> <b>total</b> <b>scores</b> and <b>the</b> scores of each item during the 5 premenstrual days and follicular phase (5 - 9 postmenstrual days) were calculated. ResultsAfter exercise, <b>the</b> <b>total</b> DRSP <b>scores</b> during <b>the</b> 5 premenstrual days and differences in <b>the</b> <b>total</b> DRSP <b>scores</b> between <b>the</b> 5 premenstrual days and the follicular phase were both significantly reduced. Of note, <b>the</b> physical symptom <b>total</b> <b>scores</b> in <b>the</b> 5 premenstrual days and the differences between its <b>total</b> <b>score</b> in <b>the</b> 5 premenstrual days and in the follicular phase were both significantly reduced. The differences between <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>scores</b> of depressed mood, anxious mood, loss of interest, and reduction in social activity during the 5 premenstrual days and the follicular phase were also reduced.

25|$|This {{abridged}} {{version of the}} K-SADS focuses on mania and is a combination/modification of Geller's WASH-U-KSADS and the 4th revision of the KSADS-P (by Joaquim Puig-Antich and Neal Ryan) Specifically, it assess 21 symptoms related to mania, hypomania, and rapid cycling. Each item is rated on a 0-6 rating scale. Scores of 0 suggest no information is available; scores of 1 suggest the symptom is not present at all; scores of 2 suggest the symptom is slightly present; scores of 3 suggest the symptom is mildly severe; scores of 4 suggest the symptom is moderately severe; scores of 5 suggest the symptom is severe; and scores of 6 suggest the symptom is extremely severe. Items with scores of 4 or higher are clinically significant/maladaptive. Trained clinicians or clinical researchers administer the assessment to both {{the child and the}} parent, which each provide their own separate score for each item (P and C), and <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>score</b> encompasses the sum of all of the items (S).|$|E
