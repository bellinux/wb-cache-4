5|$|Johnson and Larry Bird {{were first}} linked as rivals after Johnson's Michigan State squad {{defeated}} Bird's Indiana State {{team in the}} 1979 NCAA finals. The rivalry continued in the NBA, and reached its climax when Boston and Los Angeles met in {{three out of four}} NBA Finals from 1984 to 1987. Johnson asserted <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> the 82-game regular season was composed of 80 normal games, and two Lakers–Celtics games. Similarly, Bird admitted that Johnson's daily box score was the first thing he checked in the morning.|$|E
5|$|Spiritualism {{appealed to}} many educated Victorians {{who no longer}} found {{traditional}} religious doctrine, {{such as that of}} the Church of England, acceptable yet were unsatisfied with the completely materialistic and mechanical view of the world that was increasingly emerging from 19th-century science. However, several scholars who have researched Wallace's views in depth have emphasised <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> spiritualism was a matter of science and philosophy rather than religious belief. Among other prominent 19th-century intellectuals involved with spiritualism were the social reformer Robert Owen, who was one of Wallace's early idols, the physicists William Crookes and Lord Rayleigh, the mathematician Augustus De Morgan, and the Scottish publisher Robert Chambers.|$|E
25|$|Clare Boothe Luce's {{emergence}} as a formidable political orator in Congress made her a candidate to deliver the keynote speech at the 1944 Republican National Convention. She did not, however, win that honor, as many reports erroneously state. (Nor was she {{the first woman to}} address a national political convention: Corinne Roosevelt Robinson did so in 1920.) Governor Earl Warren of California was ultimately selected as keynote speaker, and Luce was asked to introduce Herbert Hoover.

25|$|Many of Euclid's propositions were constructive, {{demonstrating the}} {{existence}} of some figure by detailing the steps he used to construct the object using a compass and straightedge. His constructive approach appears even in his geometry's postulates, as {{the first and third}} postulates stating {{the existence of}} a line and circle are constructive. Instead of stating that lines and circles exist per his prior definitions, he states {{that it is possible to}} 'construct' a line and circle. It also appears <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to use a figure in one of his proofs, he needs to construct it in an earlier proposition. For example, he proves the Pythagorean theorem by first inscribing a square on the sides of a right triangle, but only after constructing a square on a given line one proposition earlier.|$|E
25|$|Presley {{had to do}} no {{more than}} provide RCA with three albums a year, and his film soundtracks did <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> With no touring or public {{appearances}} to be made, Parker was able to keep costs to a minimum. For the first few years Presley's films were somewhat successful, his albums topped the charts, and any singles that were released were mostly hits. But as time went on, as the Beatles began their dominance of the music charts and the worldwide phenomenon known as Beatlemania began, Presley became less and less successful. His films still made money and his albums still sold well, but the profits were falling. This led Parker to insist that films be made cheaply, on a strict schedule, and with as little hassle as possible.|$|E
25|$|In {{a meeting}} of the Executive Committee, Venizelos {{expressed}} his opinion that the island was not in essence autonomous, since militarily forces of the Great Powers were still present, and that the Great Powers were governing through their representative, the Prince. Venizelos suggested that once the Prince's service expired, then the Great Powers should be invited to the Committee, which, according to article 39 of the constitution (which was suppressed in the conference of Rome) would elect a new sovereign, thereby removing the need for the presence of the Great Powers. Once the Great Powers' troops left the island along with their representatives, then the union with Greece would be easier to achieve. This proposal was exploited by Venizelos' opponents, who accused him that he wanted Crete as an autonomous hegemony. Venizelos replied to the accusations by submitting once again his resignation, with the reasoning <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> it would be impossible henceforth to collaborate with the Committee's members; he assured the Commissioner however that he did not intend to join the opposition.|$|E

Welling stated {{that he was doing}} [...] "everything [...] to get Michael Rosenbaum back", because Rosenbaum was the only person Welling could have seen portraying Lex Luthor on the series. Before the airing of season 10 commenced, Welling argued <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> Luthor's return would have to be the inspiration for Clark to finally become Superman, because the idea of one character without the other was unthinkable.|$|E

While deeply affected by these experiences of Western music, he simultaneously felt a need to distance himself from the traditional music of his native Japan. He explained much later, in a lecture at the New York International Festival of the Arts, <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> Japanese traditional music [...] "always recalled the bitter memories of war".|$|E
500|$|In 1987, Downey played Julian Wells, a drug-addicted rich {{boy whose}} life rapidly spirals {{out of his}} control, in {{the film version of}} the Bret Easton Ellis novel Less Than Zero. His performance, {{described}} by Janet Maslin in The New York Times as [...] "desperately moving", was widely praised, though Downey has said <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> [...] "the role was like the ghost of Christmas Future" [...] since his drug habit resulted in his becoming an [...] "exaggeration of the character" [...] in real life. Zero drove Downey into films with bigger budgets and names, such as Chances Are (1989) with Cybill Shepherd and Ryan O'Neal, Air America (1990) with Mel Gibson, and Soapdish (1991) with Sally Field, Kevin Kline, and Whoopi Goldberg.|$|E

500|$|... "Web Weirdos" [...] {{was written}} and storyboarded by Ako Castuera and Jesse Moynihan, from a story {{developed}} by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Dick Grunert. According to Ward, the original outline for the episode was [...] "super-sitcomy" [...] and [...] "standard". Castuera and Moynihan, however, {{were able to}} transform it into something different. In the DVD commentory for the episode, Castuera noted that she enjoys physical comedy, whereas Moynihan likes focusing on emotion. She contended that this episode is therefore epitomic of their differing storyboarding sensibilities. For instance, {{the first half of}} the episode (storyboarded by Castuera) begins with Finn and Jake partaking in parkour, whereas the second part of the episode (storyboarded by Moynihan) focuses more on Barb and Ed's relationship. According to Moynihan, much of his storyboard material was inspired by experiences he had had at couples therapy with a former girlfriend. He noted <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> the episode was based on the idea that you have to have empathy for your partner.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Arwadi in {{particular}} has expressed his belief in Christianity {{that is not a}} religion, but more about faith, as in his opinion most religions are about laws, organizations, rites, and dogmas. In one interview, Jeff clarified <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> personally, faith is something that drives the human life, and, just like diet and exercise, {{does not have to be}} associated with religion whatsoever. When asked to clear up the [...] "confusion" [...] surrounding the band's stance regarding God, Christianity, and religions in general, Jeff responded that his views about religion are [...] "very different than the view in western countries," [...] and further said that [...] "in Indonesia, religion is not an issue of faith nor tradition. It's more the constitutional issue, that means the legal and political ones. I am not anti-religion person, but I do against religion in a political and legal context" [...] and then Jeff added his point on Kekal's stance as a band: [...] "...we are non-conformists, musical anarchists.

500|$|Simon Callow, who portrayed Dickens, was {{considered}} apt since he possessed extensive {{knowledge of the}} author and had experience playing the character and recreating his public readings. Callow contended <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to agree to play Dickens, the script {{would have to be}} a sufficiently high quality. When he heard that the author was to feature in Doctor Who his heart [...] "sank" [...] as he felt fiction has a tendency to posit the author as [...] "a kind of all-purpose Victorian literary character and really understand little, if anything, about him, his life or his books". Director Euros Lyn noted that the material being of interest to Callow was key to getting him involved. Promoting his role in Doctor Who, Callow stated that writer Mark Gatiss knew [...] "exactly what Dickens is all about" [...] and [...] "very cleverly connects his idealism... with the Doctor's desire to save the world". Callow was also pleased that the episode portrayed Dickens as he was towards the end of his life: ill and sad rather than energetic. In the 2011 episode [...] "The Wedding of River Song", Callow returned to reprise his role as Dickens briefly.|$|E

"Empty Orchestra" [...] had a mixed {{reception}} {{from television}} critics, being awarded {{four out of}} five by Mark Ward of the Daily Express, three out of five by Ben Lawrence of the Daily Telegraph and two out of five by the freelance journalist Dan Owen; Owen claimed that he [...] "never warmed to" [...] the episode, but considered it nonetheless worth watching. The comedy critic Bruce Dessau called it [...] "a hit", and Mark Butler, of i, offered a positive review of an episode <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "ended up being a down-to-earth, relatable and ultimately feel-good slice of drama". Many critics characterised it as weaker than other episodes of Inside No. 9, though both Julie McDowall (The National) and Lawrence stressed the quality of the programme overall, emphasising that [...] "Empty Orchestra" [...] was still commendable. The more upbeat story was [...] "a refreshingly restrained change of pace for the show" [...] for Butler, and possessed its [...] "own charm" [...] for Owen. Butler wrote that [...] "some will have no doubt been disappointed" [...] by the lack of a bloody climax, but that [...] "variety in tone and story is what helps make Inside No. 9 work so well.

[...] Carabott went on to praise the on-screen chemistry of Henry Ian Cusick (Desmond) and Sonya Walger (Penelope), stating that [...] "their on screen chemistry makes the love between the two characters real and makes their inevitable breakup that much harder to handle." [...] He also complimented the scene between Desmond and Charles, saying that [...] "it's hard not to feel Desmond's heart crushed when Widmore denies him Penelope's hand in marriage." [...] Josh Spiegel, a writer for CinemaBlend.com, had similar praise. He said <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> [...] "it was a nice change of pace to not see Jack, Kate or Sawyer {{on the show and}} focus more on some of the lesser-known castaways." [...] Spiegel {{went on to say that}} the episode was [...] "fantastic". Mania.com's Stephen Lackey wrote that [...] "Flashes Before Your Eyes" [...] was an [...] "episode has everything die hard LOST fans expect, riveting plot twists, foreshadowing, and as many questions as answers" ...|$|E
500|$|Although Jack had tattoos {{on his arm}} {{the entire}} series, their origin had never been explained. Matthew Fox {{received}} the tattoos before Lost was even created. The producers considered putting make-up over them, but instead, decided just to keep them and fit it in with the plot. According to Assistant Professor Xinping Zhu of Northeastern University, the tattoo {{is made up of}} four Chinese characters from a poem written by Mao Zedong in 1925. Fox's tattoo translates to [...] "Eagles high up, cleaving the space". (In this episode however, one of [...] "the Others" [...] tells Jack that his tattoo translates as: [...] "He walks among us, but he is not one of us." [...] Jack replies, [...] "That's what they say, that's not what they mean.") [...] The number 5 can also be seen on Fox's forearm; he got that tattoo while working on Party of Five, along with another cast member. In an interview, Fox said <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> getting a tattoo was a [...] "pretty intense experience", and something he would not do in the [...] "spur of the moment". He thought Jack having tattoos was a [...] "really cool idea". Since Fox used tattoos to represent memories or meaningful events in his life, the writers took a similar approach when dealing with Jack's tattoos.|$|E

500|$|It {{is likely}} <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> {{the death of}} his father personalised an already bitter {{struggle}} with the Nevilles. Michael Hicks, for example, has suggested that [...] "the heirs of the dead lords... now wanted revenge for their fathers' deaths. They were not particular whether by constitutional trial or by assassination." [...] Warwick especially was held accountable. King Henry VI imposed a reconciliation between the warring factions of St Albans in early 1458, and commanded the various parties, including Clifford, to London. Clifford arrived there, a contemporary chronicler recorded, [...] "with a grete power," [...] and demanded compensation for his father's death. In this, he was accompanied by the other [...] "yong lordes whoos fadres were sleyne at Seynt Albonys." [...] Jointly with Lord Egremont and the new earl of Northumberland, Clifford is believed to have had an army of around 1,500 men in London in early 1458 where, with Egremont and the duke of Exeter, he attempted to ambush Warwick and York on their way to Westminster. It is likely that they had organised armed gangs for the purpose of arresting the Yorkist lords, if not assassinating them. The Mayor of London believed they came [...] "agaynst the peas," [...] and excluded them from the city. Thus, Clifford and the others were forced to lodge at Temple Bar, between the city and Westminster, probably in a house of one of the various bishops that lined the route. The king, as arbitrator, resided out of London, at Berkhamsted Castle, and Clifford visited him there on 1 March– [...] "presumably to influence the result [...] probably unsuccessfully," [...] says Hicks. Clifford later participated in what was known ceremonially as the 'Loveday' on the 24th of the month, which saw the king arbitrate a settlement between the warring parties. As a result of this, and as part of a general compensation package between the families of the battle's victors and losers, Clifford was to be paid £666 by the earl of Warwick. This was to be shared between John and his siblings.|$|E
