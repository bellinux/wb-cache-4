Plate current increases and screen current decreases, giving the screen negative resistance (grey region).|$|E
5000|$|Negative {{transconductance}} oscillators, {{such as the}} <b>transitron</b> <b>oscillator</b> {{invented by}} Cleto Brunetti in 1939, are similar negative resistance vacuum tube oscillator circuits {{which are based on}} negative transconductance (a fall in current through one grid electrode caused by an increase in voltage on a second grid) in a pentode or other multigrid vacuum tube. [...] These replaced the dynatron circuit and were employed in vacuum tube electronic equipment through the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Since the <b>transitron</b> <b>oscillator</b> didn't {{depend on}} {{secondary}} emission {{it was far}} more reliable than the dynatron. However, because the screen grid is not designed to handle high power, the oscillator's output power is limited. Other tubes with multiple grids beside the pentode, such as the hexode and pentagrid converter tube, have been {{be used to make}} similar negative transconductance oscillators. Pentode tubes used in this circuit have a negative transconductance of only around -250 microsiemens, giving a negative resistance of -4000Ω. Tubes with more grids, such as the pentagrid converter, {{can be used to make}} transitron oscillators with higher transconductance, resulting in smaller negative resistance.|$|E
5000|$|The dynatron and <b>transitron</b> <b>{{oscillator}}s</b> {{differ from}} many oscillator circuits {{in that they}} do not use feedback to generate oscillations, but negative resistance. [...] A tuned circuit (resonant circuit), consisting of an inductor and capacitor connected together, can store electric energy in the form of oscillating currents, [...] "ringing" [...] analogously to a tuning fork. [...] If a tuned circuit could have zero electrical resistance, once oscillations were started it would function as an oscillator, producing a continuous sine wave. But because of the inevitable resistance inherent in actual circuits, without an external source of power the energy in the oscillating current is dissipated as heat in the resistance, and any oscillations decay to zero.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>transitron</b> <b>oscillator,</b> {{invented by}} Cledo Brunetti in 1939, (although {{a similar effect}} was {{observed}} in tetrodes by Balthasar van der Pol in 1926, and Edward Herold described a similar oscillator in 1935) is a negative resistance oscillator circuit using a pentode vacuum tube, in which, instead of the plate, the screen grid has negative resistance due to being coupled to the suppressor grid. [...] See the circuit at right. In the transitron, the screen grid is biased at a positive voltage (battery B1) above the plate voltage while the suppressor grid is biased negatively (battery B2), at or below the cathode voltage. Therefore, all the electrons will be reflected by the negative suppressor grid and none will get through to the plate. The reflected electrons will instead be attracted to the screen grid, so the screen current will be high while the plate current will be zero. However, if the suppressor grid voltage is increased, as it approaches zero (the cathode voltage) electrons will begin to pass through it and reach the plate, so the number diverted to the screen grid, and thus the screen current, will decrease. Since the other grids don't take significant current the cathode current [...] is split between the plate [...] and the screen grid : The division of current between the screen grid and plate {{is controlled by the}} suppressor voltage. This inverse relationship is indicated by saying the transconductance between the screen and suppressor grid (the change in screen current ΔIG2 divided by the change in suppressor voltage ΔVG3) is negative.|$|E
