25|$|The {{possible}} {{impression that}} solo divers are unsociable is often wrong. Most solo divers are normally gregarious {{and want to}} share their enjoyment of diving with others – <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do it {{when they get to}} the surface. The solitude they want to enjoy is during the dive. These solo divers take pleasure in this solitude and in the feeling of self-sufficiency for this style of diving, that one is not dependent on others, but is relying solely on one's own skills and capabilities. Finally, there is the sense of freedom, of not being impeded by the need to look after anyone but oneself and therefore being able to achieve one's own goal in the dive without compromising.|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, {{a number}} of changes were made in New Haven and in the {{subsequent}} two weeks of previews in Boston. The show was running long; Logan persuaded his friend, playwright Emlyn Williams, {{to go over the}} script and cut extraneous dialogue. [...] There were wide expectations of a hit; producer Mike Todd came backstage and advised that the show not be taken to New York [...] "because it's too damned good for them". The show moved to Boston, where it was so successful that playwright George S. Kaufman joked that people lining up there at the Shubert Theatre [...] "don't actually want anything... <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> push money under the doors." ...|$|E

500|$|Israeli {{journalist}} Lily Galili attributed this {{to being}} {{in part due to}} an unwillingness to make land concessions for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. She explained, [...] "They come from this huge empire to this tiny Israel and they say: 'Is that all, is that the country? And what, you want to give back the territories? Who gives up territory in the first place! And in this small country. You must be kidding!'" [...] Russian-speaking Israeli analyst Igor Khlopitsky stated that this also resulted from the Russian-speaking Israelis generally wanting quick results during times of turmoil, saying, [...] "Those who came after Perestroika had the Soviet mentality beaten out of them by the very difficult problems of the time. And where some other Israelis see the possibilities for discussion and dialogue, <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> solve the problems swiftly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Professor Amos Kloner, former Jerusalem {{district}} archaeologist of the Israel Antiquities Authority and {{the first}} archaeologist to examine the tomb in 1980, told the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper that the name Jesus had been found 71 times in burial caves at around that time. Furthermore, {{he said that the}} inscription on the ossuary is not clear enough to ascertain, and although the idea fails to hold up by archaeological standards it makes for profitable television. Quote: [...] "The new evidence is not serious, and I do not accept that it is connected to the family of Jesus…. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get money for it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Whistle-blowers {{are often}} high-performing {{employees}} {{who believe they}} are doing their job (Martin, 2005). <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> bring people's attention to a problem that is potentially harmful or unethical. [...] Despite this, whistle-blowers are perceived negatively and suffer grave consequences. They are often ostracized, harassed, and attacked by their superiors and coworkers. They face termination, financial losses, stress, relationship breakdown, and health problems. Even worse, few whistle-blowers seem to bring about any change. The organization seems to put all their efforts into destroying the whistle-blower while ignoring the original problem. The organization will take great measures to cover-up the problem, devalue the target, reinterpret the events, and intimidate and/or bribe the whistle-blowers (Martin, 2005).|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the show, {{the judges}} {{surprised}} the public when they asked five contestants: Nat Vázquez, Frances Marrero, Natalia Herrera, Juan Vélez, and José Vargas to step out front. However, <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> congratulate them for their excellent performances.|$|R

2500|$|Armenia, {{which has}} no coal, natural gas or oil of its own and scant wind and water resources, had long been {{suffering}} from severe energy shortages and now blockaded by neighbouring Turkey and Azerbaijan, from whom it used to import nearly all its fuel, was forced to announce that it would restart the second of two VVER reactors in the Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant. Armenian Environmental Committee Chairman Samuel Shahinian explained the decision; [...] "Our people are so cold we cannot explain anything to them, <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be warm." [...] The reactors, which had been commissioned by the Soviet authorities in 1979 and had long been considered dangerously out-of-date, were shut down in 1988 over safety concerns following the nearby Spitak earthquake. The announcement prompted uproar in Turkey whose border is just 17km from Metsamor. [...] "There are certain risks", confirmed Armenian Deputy Speaker Ara Sahakian, [...] "but we should realise and everyone should realise we have no other choice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Susan Griffin {{was one of}} {{the first}} feminists to write on pornography's {{implications}} in her 1981 Pornography and Silence. Beyond Brownmiller and Griffin's positions, Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin influenced debates and activism around pornography and prostitution, particularly at the Supreme Court of Canada. MacKinnon, a lawyer, has stated, [...] "To be about to be raped is to be gender female in the process of going about life as usual." [...] She explained sexual harassment by saying that it [...] "doesn't mean that they all want to fuck us, <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hurt us, dominate us, and control us, and that is fucking us." [...] Some see radical feminism as the only movement that truly expresses the pain of being a woman in an unequal society, as it portrays that reality with the experiences of the battered and violated, which they claim to be the norm. Critics, including some feminists, civil libertarians, and jurists, have found this position uncomfortable and alienating.|$|E

5000|$|The band {{thrived in}} Austin, where audiences cared {{more about the}} actual music than the glamorous {{presentation}} of the musicians.
