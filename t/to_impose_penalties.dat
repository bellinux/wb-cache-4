25|$|National laws of Malaysia require Muslim apostates {{who seek}} to convert from Islam to another {{religion}} to first obtain approval from a sharia court. The procedure demands that anyone born to a Muslim parent, or who previously converted to Islam, must declare himself apostate of Islam before a Sharia court {{if he or she}} wants to convert. The Sharia courts have the power <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>penalties</b> such as jail, caning and enforced “rehabilitation” on apostates – which is the typical practice. In the states of Perak, Malacca, Sabah, and Pahang, apostates of Islam face jail term; in Pahang, caning; others, confinement with rehabilitation process.|$|E
25|$|Since 1972, {{however, the}} U.K. has fallen under the cross-border-competition law regime of the European Community, which is found {{primarily}} in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty of the European Community. Companies that form a cartel or collude to disrupt competition (Article 81) or to abuse a dominant {{position in the}} market – for instance through a monopoly (Article 82) – face fines from the public-enforcement authorities, {{and in some cases}} they also face a cause of action in tort. A huge issue in the E.U. is whether to follow the U.S. approach of private damages actions to prevent anti-competitive conduct. In other words, the question is what should be seen as a private wrong (as was held in the vertical restraints case of Courage Ltd v Crehan) and what should be seen as a public wrong where only public enforcers are competent <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>penalties.</b> In 1998 the United Kingdom brought its legislation up to date, with the Competition Act 1998, followed by the Enterprise Act 2002, a regime mirroring that of the European Union. The domestic enforcers are the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the rare}} {{occasions}} when someone performs the anthem incorrectly, {{the federal government has}} been known <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>penalties</b> to maintain the [...] "dignity" [...] of the national symbols. One example is when a performer forgot some of the lyrics at a soccer match in Guadalajara, she was fined 400 MXN by the Interior Ministry and released an apology letter to the country through the Interior Ministry. In addition, the anthem is sometimes used as a tool against people who might not be [...] "true Mexicans". In one case, a young man of Afro-Mexican descent was stopped by police and forced to sing the anthem to prove his nationality. In a separate incident in Japan, police officers asked four men to sing the Mexican anthem after they were arrested in Tokyo on charges of breaking and entering. However, when the men could not sing the anthem, it was discovered that they were Colombian nationals holding forged Mexican passports. They were later charged with more counts on theft of merchandise and money.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{elaboration}} of the Witherspoon v. Illinois (1968) doctrine, the Rehnquist Court considered {{challenges to the}} selection of jurors who would automatically vote <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> the death <b>penalty</b> on a defendant convicted of a capital offense. In a 6-3 decision, Justice White wrote for the majority that a defendant facing the death penalty may challenge for cause a prospective juror who would automatically vote <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> the death <b>penalty</b> in every case. Just as a juror who is unalterably opposed to the imposition {{of the death penalty}} must be excluded because he or she cannot conscientiously fulfill the oath to follow the law and the instructions to the jury pursuant thereto, so should one who would automatically vote <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> the death <b>penalty</b> be excluded for the same reason. Such a juror, he emphasized, would lack the qualities of impartiality and indifference required by due process. Furthermore, Justice White noted, jurors who would automatically vote <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> the death <b>penalty</b> would not [...] "in good faith ... consider evidence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances" [...] as may be required by law and included in jury instructions.|$|R

50|$|Article 114 {{entails a}} civil right: the {{prohibition}} of the death penalty, included by the constitutional revision of 1983 after the death penalty itself had already been abolished in 1870. The article is not a guarantee, as doctrine holds that {{in a state of}} emergency any right might be suspended by unwritten constitutional emergency law; also in principle some treaty might oblige the judge <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> the death <b>penalty.</b> However, in fact the Netherlands has ratified the Sixth Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights, also containing a prohibition and having precedence over any other treaty. Therefore, since 1986 no Dutch judge has any formal competence <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> the death <b>penalty.</b> Nevertheless, the Dutch government might by treaty be obligated to cooperate with some international tribunal with the powers <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> the death <b>penalty,</b> such as the International Military Tribunal once was.|$|R
