5|$|Crittenden was {{appointed}} to the United States Senate in 1842, filling the vacancy caused by Clay's resignation. In January 1843, he was elected to a full term over Richard Mentor Johnson. The Whigs' feud with President Tyler continued unabated, and some even talked of impeaching him, but Crittenden condemned <b>that</b> <b>course</b> of action. During the 27th and 28th Congresses, he served on the Committee on Military Affairs. He was an advocate of moderate protective tariffs and federal internal improvements. He opposed giving states the option to forgo apportionment, which would have allowed them to elect their congressmen at-large.|$|E

Others who began their painting careers through <b>that</b> <b>course</b> include Mona Rockman Napaljarri and Louisa Napaljarri. Western Desert artists such as Peggy Rockman will frequently paint particular 'dreamings', or stories, for which they have personal responsibility or rights, which in Peggy's case include Ngatijirri (budgerigar), Warna (snake), Laju and Ngarlu.|$|E

Opponents of <b>coursing</b> say <b>that</b> the converse is true, namely <b>that</b> <b>coursing</b> takes place where hares live rather than hares living where coursing takes place. It is also the case <b>that</b> <b>coursing</b> kills slower hares, and it is said by some coursers that this leaves faster hares to breed and multiply.|$|R

25|$|The action–motivation model {{proposes that}} {{inconsistencies}} in a person's cognition cause mental stress, because psychologic inconsistency {{interferes with the}} person's functioning in the real world. Among the ways for coping, the person can choose to exercise a behavior that is inconsistent {{with his or her}} current attitude (a belief, an ideal, a value system), but later try to alter that belief to be consonant with a current behaviour; the cognitive dissonance occurs when the person's cognition does not match the action taken. If the person changes the current attitude, after the dissonance occurs, he or she then is obligated to commit to <b>that</b> <b>course</b> of behaviour.|$|E

25|$|In U.S. Army Air Forces use, the Norden bombsight was {{attached}} to its autopilot base, which was in turn connected with the aircraft's autopilot. The Honeywell C-1 autopilot {{could be used as}} an autopilot by the flight crew during the journey to the target area through a control panel in the cockpit, but was more commonly used under direct command of the bombardier. The Norden's box-like autopilot unit sat behind and below the sight and attached to it at a single rotating pivot. After control of the aircraft was passed to the bombardier during the bomb run, he would first rotate the entire Norden so the vertical line in the sight passed through the target. From that point on, the autopilot would attempt to guide the bomber so it followed the course of the bombsight, and pointed the heading to zero out the drift rate, fed to it through a coupling. As the aircraft turned onto the correct angle, a belt and pulley system rotated the sight back to match the changing heading. The autopilot was another reason for the Norden's accuracy, as it ensured the aircraft quickly followed the correct course and kept it on <b>that</b> <b>course</b> much more accurately than the pilots could.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Test whether how professors {{represent}} {{the learning process}} (understanding-oriented or recall-oriented) {{is connected to the}} evaluation procedures and to the use of teaching technology. Design/methodology: 63 students produced 315 records referred to the compulsory courses belonging to the second year of the Medicine grade. The hypothesis states <b>that</b> those <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> use a multiple choice evaluation procedure and verbose slides will be more recall-oriented than those using other evaluation procedures. Findings: Results show <b>that</b> <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> are more oriented to recall make a larger use of PowerPoint technology, predominating verbal slides, and students have a poorer academic achievement and a lower self-perception of learning. Limitations: Further studies should encompass a wider sample of courses, years and grades. Originality/value: Hitherto no study has considered simultaneously the incidence of learning self-perception, evaluation procedures and the use of PowerPoint technology...|$|R
