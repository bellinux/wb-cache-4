50|$|The Memoir of 1795 {{emphasizes}} {{the love and}} dedication both Lady Hyegyong and her father had for the royal family, especially pertaining to Sado and Chongjo. By stressing these personal relationships, Lady Hyegyong asserts her and her father’s loyalty in order to defend their reaction to Sado’s execution. Throughout the memoir, Lady Hyegyong highlights her and her family’s dedication to serving her son. It is through this argument she explains her and her father’s decision <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>and</b> <b>stay</b> at court in order to serve Chongjo as well as protect the dynastic line (Haboush, “Memoirs” p. 86). After describing the aftermath of Sado’s execution, Lady Hyegyong states, “Like me, father’s only thought and concern was to protect the Grand Heir, and so, {{for the sake of}} the nation, he controlled his sorrow and did not retire from office” (Haboush, “Memoirs” p. 86). By portraying herself and her father this way, Lady Hyegyong passionately defends their family’s integrity to the Hong family’s next patriarch.|$|E

In {{the third section}} “Intimate letters” of the book Բանաստեղծին Սիրտը (The Heart of the Poet) (2012), we encounter his first platonic love letter to Mrs. Lucie Potoukian (Tosbath), written {{at the age of}} 24. Later, he, with a greater out-pouring of emotions, corresponds with the elder sister of Lucie, Siran Seza, a prose writer and the editor of newly publishedYeridasart Hayouhi Երիտասարդ Հայուհի (The Young Armenian), and with Alice Sinanian. Chronologically, from the first and to the last letter addressed to Siran Seza (11 September 1935), these love letters demonstrate the noble, sincere and genuine sentiments of the author, written in the sweet resonance and the magnificent architecture of the Western Armenian language, different from the language of his other letters, and which can certainly be considered as a literary tour de force by itself.From 1946 onwards to his death in 1998, Vahe-Vahian took the decision <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>and</b> <b>stay</b> in Lebanon, despite the continuous civil war in the area from 1975 to 1990, with the strong conviction that the dismantling of the Armenian Community in Lebanon would be the last blow of mercy to the Armenian Diaspora.|$|E

40|$|The idea of {{indigenous}} populations {{around the world}} as “noble savages” dominated literature for much of the 20 th century. Further research into different tribes’ environmental practices as well as their integration into the market economy has begun to change this view. In Ecuadorian Amazon, the Huaorani are the most recently assimilated group, with some sub-groups still resisting contact with the outside. With vast reserves of oil present under Huaorani land, this indigenous group has quickly become integrated into national and international markets. The focus of this study is on one Huaorani community, Gareno, which is located along an oil road within the Amazon. Community members were interviewed in order to better understand why they lived along the oil road and how they felt it impacted their daily lives. Responses showed that the residents have chosen <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>and</b> <b>stay</b> in Gareno because of the health and education opportunities and ease of transport, but also because this area is ancestral territory. In addition, they left former villages, which were deep inside the forest, due to social conflict. It is notable that these push and pull factors complicate the notion of “noble savages” (who either continue to be isolated from the market or are unable to cope with it) and highlight indigenous agency and decision-making during a period of rapid cultural, economic, and ecological change. As the people of Gareno look to further improve their quality of life through development, it is important to foster more nuanced views {{of indigenous}} peoples to not only devise appropriate conservation and development policies but also to prevent a backlash when they do not conform to idealized Western images...|$|E
40|$|The {{inclined}} rate {{of infant}} mortality and maternal mortality in Indonesia has urged the Government to conduct various {{efforts to reduce}} Infant Mortality and Maternal Mortality. One of the Ministry of Health Program is placing midwives in Villages. According To Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey 2002 - 2003, the Maternal Mortality rate is 307 per 100, 000 live births and the infant mortality rate is 35 per 1, 000 live births. Tendency of the diminuation of Maternal Mortality Rate is an estimated image due to sampling errors {{it was difficult to}} ascertain the diminuation of Maternal Mortality Rate. This paper {{is a part of the}} study of village midwife perception about their duty, role and function in Tangerang District. The result of research showed positive community acceptance of the existence of midwives in the villages and her working relationship with other officers in the villages is mutual. In villages, pregnant mothers have used midwives to assist delivering their babies although some of them are still assisted by Traditional Birth Attendants. The data from Tangerang District Health Office indicated that percentage of pregnant women who control their pregnancy to Puskesmas for the first time (K 1 coverage) is 69, 56 percent, while coverage of full antenatal care during their pregnancy (K 4) to Puskesmas is 59, 66 percent. It is assumed that the rest of the mothers still assisted by Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs), because in 1999 the role of TBAs is still high enough, which is 16, 29 percent. Midwives are expected <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>and</b> <b>stay</b> in the village so they can motivate mothers. It is suggested that although community have received Midwife services, but their service still needs to be improved, so in the future all delineries can be assisted by Midwifes. <br /...|$|E

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Many older people {{in western countries}} express a desire <b>to</b> <b>live</b> inde-pendently <b>and</b> <b>stay</b> {{in control of their}} lives {{for as long as possible}} in spite of the afflictions that may accompany old age. Consequently, older people require care at home and additional support. In some care situations, tension and ambiguity may arise between professionals and clients whose views on risk prevention or health promotion may differ. Following Antonovsky’s salutogenic framework, different perspectives between professionals and clients on the pathways that lead to health promotion might lead to mechanisms that explain the origin of these tensions and how they may ultimately lead to reduced responsiveness of older clients to engage in care. This is illustrated with a case study of an older woman living in the community, Mrs Jansen, and her health and social care professionals. The study shows that despite good intentions, engagement, clear division of tasks and tailored care, the responsiveness to receive care can indeed not always be taken for granted. We conclude that to harmonize differences in perspectives between professionals and older people, attention should be given to the way older people endow meaning to the demanding circumstances they encounter (comprehensibility), their perceive...|$|R

Therefore, it is important that both clients and professionals have an open mind and attempt to understand each others’ perspective, and have a dialogue with each other, taking the life narrative of clients into account.

60|$|Francesca was one {{of those}} women towards whom Fate appears to have the best {{intentions}} and never to carry them into practice. With the advantages put at her disposal she might have been expected to command a more than average share of feminine happiness. So {{many of the things that}} make for fretfulness, disappointment and discouragement in a woman's life were removed from her path that she might well have been considered the fortunate Miss Greech, or later, lucky Francesca Bassington. And she was not of the perverse band of those who make a rock-garden of their souls by dragging into them all the stoney griefs and unclaimed troubles they can find lying around them. Francesca loved the smooth ways and pleasant places of life; she liked not merely to look on the bright side of things but <b>to</b> <b>live</b> there <b>and</b> <b>stay</b> there. <b>And</b> the fact that things had, at one time and another, gone badly with her and cheated her of some of her early illusions made her cling the closer to such good fortune as remained to her now that she seemed to have reached a calmer period of her life. To undiscriminating friends she appeared in the guise of a rather selfish woman, but it was merely the selfishness of one who had seen the happy and unhappy sides of life and wished to enjoy to the utmost what was left to her of the former. The vicissitudes of fortune had not soured her, but they had perhaps narrowed her in the sense of making her concentrate much of her sympathies on things that immediately pleased and amused her, or that recalled and perpetuated the pleasing and successful incidents of other days. And it was her drawing-room in particular that enshrined the memorials or tokens of past and present happiness.|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} a {{synthesis}} of three previous studies which analysed the attractiveness of the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area (AMA) for three groups: creative knowledge workers and graduates, managers in selected creative knowledge industries and transnational migrants in the creative knowledge industry who are working in the creative knowledge sectors. The studies were conducted between July 2007 and December 2008. One of the main aims of all three studies was to tease out of the proposed growing importance of the creative knowledge workers goes in hand with a change of {{the evaluation of the}} location factors in metropolitan regions. Florida proposed in his books a presentation that Amsterdam {{can be seen as a}} model for the future development. It is a compact city which oriented towards cycling. It has one of the highest shares of foreign population. Looking at the path development of Amsterdam, we also expected that the AMA would score high on soft factors like tolerance and diversity. The results, however, bring other points to the fore. Still, the labour market is reported to be the most important factor. This is followed by other hard factors such as the availability of educational institutions and the situation of the housing market. The latter, however, works as a push factor. Since not all creative knowledge workers can be conceived as affluent and especially starters, creative workers and also some groups of transnational migrants (PhDstudents) receive about average income, some groups of the creative knowledge workers are sensitive in this respect. The housing market in Amsterdam in particular is divided between a large, inexpensive social housing segment which is not accessible for most of the average earning creative knowledge workers and a small segment of expensive private sectors housing. The evaluation of the soft factors showed that soft factors alone hardly motivate creative knowledge workers to accommodate in Amsterdam. Also the named soft factors often vary between the groups. Unexpectedly, the importance of personal trajectories and personal networks was often reported as one of the most important reasons <b>to</b> <b>live,</b> work <b>and</b> <b>stay</b> in the AMA. Florida appears to construct our temporary society as fluent and he portrays the individuals as socially and spatially independent. The results of the studies however show that the embeddedness of persons in a local and regional life world with strong personal ties is a more accurate portrayal of the contemporary society in the AMA...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{researches}} {{the phenomenon}} ‘caring relationship’. The empirical studies {{in this thesis}} were carried out in China with the aim to describe the caring relationship in China through the lifeworld experiences of professional caregivers and patients. The result of this study will later on relate to a study of Swedish caring relationships. For this phenomenological study 9 patients, 10 medical and healthcare workers and 4 nursing tutors were interviewed. They were from 5 different medical and care units from two hospitals, one private clinic and a nursing school in Southern China. This study shows that caring relationship in China has many layers. Embedded in the basic interpersonal relationship is a ‘relationship of need’. The relationship carries a goal: to help the patient to restore a personal harmonic existence and regain the responsibility for their health. The relationship is temporary and normally ends when the goal is achieved. The relationship is initiated by the patients need for help. The two main actors in the caring relationship are {{the patient and the}} caregiver with their roles as care seeker and care provider. This study shows that to become a patient is a process of diminishing the natural ordinary self which makes the person feel vulnerable. Caregivers take a leading role which carries responsibility. They feel an obligation to use all their knowledge and resources {{for the benefit of the}} patients. They teach them how <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>and</b> how <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> healthy. A main function in the caring relationship is the transfer of knowledge. The caregivers feel the need to create a dialog to get access to the patients’ unique knowledge about themselves so that the caregiver’s general knowledge of health and care can be applied to the individual. Through the informal chats they share the patient’s experiences, emotions and history. It creates en opportunity for the interpersonal relationship to grow deeper and for the patient and the caregiver to meet as fellow human beings. In the Chinese caring relationship the patient’s family is included. It is considered to be every contributor’s duty to be responsible for oneself and for others. Mutual understanding and respect in a caring relationship are important in getting the patient back into balance...|$|R
