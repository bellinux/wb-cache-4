5|$|In 1995, a 60th Anniversary edition was {{released}} in a gold box. In late 1998, Hasbro announced a campaign to add an all-new token to U.S. standard edition sets of Monopoly. Voters were allowed to select from a biplane, a piggy bank, and a sack of money — with votes being tallied through a special website, via a <b>toll-free</b> phone number, and at FAO Schwarz stores.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the late 1950s, plans for a Tulsa freeway system {{included}} a route along 96th Street South. The 96th Street corridor was accessible to more motorists than other corridors further south (farther away from the urban core), while still having low right-of-way costs, comparable to more southerly corridors. This made it the ideal route for a south Tulsa freeway. In 1986, ODOT had {{plans to build a}} <b>toll-free</b> facility called the Creek Freeway in the corridor as part of SH-117.|$|E
5|$|They {{also agreed}} to fixed limits on how many pop-ups they can {{generate}} on a computer (maximum of 5 per day, 1 per hour), the requirement to provide a mute button for any sound content in the pop-ups {{and be able to}} close the windows, and provide a hyperlink with <b>toll-free</b> number and email utility, to request stopping the pop-ups under certain conditions. The defendants also promised to clearly label any single-click download or install buttons, and not pre-select these as the default.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{upstream}} toll bridges at Windsor and Maidenhead, {{the crossing}} at Datchet was <b>toll-free</b> for both River and road and {{quickly became a}} popular crossing. Seeking compensation for loss of income on their bridges, the corporations of Windsor and Maidenhead made claims to the Treasury. In 1708 Windsor was granted an ex-gratia payment of £55 (equivalent to £ today) plus £25 and £20 to two tenants (equivalent to £ and £ respectively). Maidenhead's complaint, not made until 1714, was noted but no compensation paid.|$|E
5|$|All intersections found {{along the}} route are grade separated, except for a single {{at-grade}} intersection currently regulated by traffic lights; a new route is planned to bypass this intersection. As of June 2012, there were tenexits and twoservice areas {{along the route}}. The motorway is currently <b>toll-free</b> except for the Učka Tunnel and the Kanfanar-Rogovići section. However, most of the motorway is potentially a toll road using a ticket system, with each exit including a toll plaza except those of Veprinac, Opatija, and Matulji. The toll system of the A8/A9 Istrian Y is integrated: no ticket needs to be turned in, gotten, or exchanged when going from the A8 to the A9 or vice versa.|$|E
5|$|East of NY198, {{the road}} becomes more open {{as it passes}} through neighborhoods with a more {{suburban}} residential feel to them. Along this stretch, NY33 connects to several streets, including Bailey Avenue (U.S. Route62 or US62) and Harlem Road (NY240). Past Harlem Road, the expressway makes a slight curve to the south as it prepares to meet a <b>toll-free</b> section of the New York State Thruway (I-90) at a cloverleaf interchange. Beyond I-90, the expressway veers to the south again, traversing an S-curve before connecting to Union Road (NY277) {{by way of a}} partial interchange. After another , NY33 curves south under Genesee Street before joining it at a traffic light in front of the Buffalo Niagara International Airport.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of I-287's New Jersey portion in 1993, more out-of-state tractor trailer drivers began to use the alignment of Route31 as a <b>toll-free</b> alternative to the New Jersey Turnpike. On July 16, 1999, oversize trucks were banned from using Route31 {{as part of a}} larger statewide ban imposed on New Jersey roads not a part of the National Highway System by then-governor Christine Todd Whitman. The legislation had a significant effect on trucks that followed Route31 as it forced them to use I-287 and the New Jersey Turnpike instead. In themid-2000s, the portion of Route31 was widened during extensive construction between Flemington and Clinton that widened the road to four lanes.|$|E
5|$|On 10 March 1859 {{the last}} {{subscriber}} {{to the main}} tontine died, having for over five years received the full £800 per annum set aside for subscribers to the first tontine, and {{with the death of}} its last member the scheme expired. On 25 March 1859 Richmond Bridge became <b>toll-free.</b> A large procession made its way to the bridge, where a team of labourers symbolically removed toll gates from their hinges. The toll houses were demolished, replaced by seating in 1868; investment income from the revenue accumulated during the 83years the tolls had been charged was sufficient to pay for the bridge's maintenance.|$|E
5|$|Potential contestants of the {{original}} primetime version had {{to compete in a}} telephone contest which had them dial a <b>toll-free</b> number and answer three questions by putting objects or events in order. Callers had ten seconds to enter the order on a keypad, with any incorrect answer ending the game/call. The 10,000 to 20,000 candidates who answered all three questions correctly were selected into a random drawing in which approximately 300 contestants competed for ten spots on the show using the same phone quiz method. Accommodations for contestants outside the New York City area included round trip airfare (or other transportation) and hotel accommodations.|$|E
5|$|Roads in Sibu {{are under}} the {{jurisdiction}} of Sibu Municipal Council (SMC). Some of the notable roads in Sibu are Brooke Drive, Archer Street, and Wong Nai Siong Street. Kwong Ann roundabout is located near Brooke Drive in town centre while Bukit Lima roundabout is located near Wong King Huo Street in the uptown area. Sibu is also connected to other major towns and cities in Sarawak such as Kuching by Pan Borneo Highway. In early 2011, Sibu-Tanjung Manis Highway was opened. In April 2006, Lanang Bridge connecting Sibu to Sarikei and Bintangor across the Rajang River was opened. <b>Toll-free</b> Durin Bridge was opened in October 2006 connecting Sibu to other places such as Julau. The Durin bridge is located near the satellite township of Sibu Jaya.|$|E
5|$|The first {{bridge on}} the site was a toll bridge built by Julian Tolmé in 1873, in the {{expectation}} that the western terminus of the Hammersmith and City Railway would shortly be built on the north bank, leading to {{a sharp increase in}} the number of people wanting to cross the river at this point. The railway terminus was not built, and problems with drainage on the approach road made access to the bridge difficult for vehicles. Wandsworth Bridge was commercially unsuccessful, and in 1880 it was taken into public ownership and made <b>toll-free.</b> Tolmé's bridge was narrow and too weak to carry buses, and in 1926 a Royal Commission recommended its replacement.|$|E
5|$|Also on November 28, 2006, a 14-disc DVD box set titled Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition was released, {{containing}} Superman, Superman II, , Superman III, Superman IV, Superman Returns, and , {{among other}} releases. All {{contents of the}} set were housed within a tin case. The set was valued at US$99.92, and received extremely positive reviews when first released. However, after only {{a day on the}} market, Warner Bros. announced that there were two errors discovered within the set. The first was that the 2.0 audio track on Superman, was instead the 5.1 audio track already on the disc. The second was that the Superman III disc was not the 2006 deluxe edition as advertised, but the 2001 release instead. The set was soon recalled, and Warner Bros. offered a <b>toll-free</b> number to replace the faulty discs for people who had already purchased the set. Due to popular demand, a corrected set was released and Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition returned to store shelves on May 29, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Although {{reasonably}} well used, it was unpopular with the public, who objected to being obliged to pay tolls to use it. On 4 July 1857, {{almost a year}} before the bridge's opening, a demonstration against the tolls attracted 6,000 residents. Concerns were raised in Parliament that poorer industrial workers in Chelsea, which had no large parks of its own, would be unable to afford to use the new park in Battersea. Bowing to public pressure, shortly after the bridge opened Parliament declared it free to use for pedestrians on Sundays, and in 1875 it was also made <b>toll-free</b> on public holidays. Additionally, because the main lights were only turned on when Queen Victoria was staying in London, it was poorly used at night. Despite this, the new Battersea Park was extremely popular, particularly the sporting facilities; on 9 January 1864 the park staged the world's first official game of association football.|$|E
5|$|On November 29, 1932, the California State Highway Commission {{received}} a recommendation {{to purchase the}} road {{and was able to}} invest $418,000USD by 1936. However, the U.S. Navy owned rights to the right-of-way of part of the route, and opposed the purchase. This resulted in congressional actions to establish a clear title deed for the route. House Representative Richard J. Welch was one of the earliest government officials to pressure the State of California to acquire the toll road in order to convert it into a <b>toll-free</b> highway. He argued that having only one toll road to travel in order to reach the Golden Gate Bridge would benefit commuters; he also cited the ten and seventh-tenths-mile difference in distance between the toll road and a route through Napa. A Navy Department deed permitting the State to purchase the road was granted by the Attorney General on October 26, 1938. The highway then became signed as State Route 48 until the 1964 renumbering.|$|E
5|$|The Act of 1767 had {{specified}} {{points on}} the river at which tolls could be collected, but had {{made no mention of}} tolls for use of Bow Creek, Bow Back Rivers, or the section of the navigation between Bow tidal gates and Old Ford, and these had remained <b>toll-free.</b> An Act of Parliament obtained on 14 August 1850 allowed the trustees to build a pound lock at Bow tidal gates. To prevent opposition from the bargees, the Act had formalised the freedom from tolls on the Bow River section. Once the lock was built, however, the trustees charged a toll for using it. This was unpopular, but there was still the option of using the tidal gates at certain states of the tide, which did not incur a toll. A clause to authorise the lock toll was deleted by Parliament from a subsequent Act of 1868, and it was still the case in 1977 that a charge was made for using the lock but not for using the gates.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Unity Council {{incorporated}} a Montreal-based lobbying group called Option Canada with the mandate to promote federalism in Quebec. Option Canada received $1.6 million in {{funding from the}} Canadian Heritage Department in 1994, $3.35 million in 1995 and $1.1 million in 1996. The Montreal Gazette reported in March 1997 that the group also had other funds from undeclared sources. A Committee to Register Voters Outside Quebec was created to help citizens who had left Quebec before the 1995 vote register on the electoral list. The Committee handed out pamphlets during the referendum, including a form {{to be added to}} the list of voters. The pamphlet gave out a <b>toll-free</b> number as contact information, which was the same number as the one used by the Canadian Unity Council.|$|E
5|$|The first Chelsea Bridge was {{proposed}} in the 1840s {{as part of a}} major development of marshlands on the south bank of the Thames into the new Battersea Park. It was a suspension bridge intended to provide convenient access from the densely populated north bank to the new park. Although built and operated by the government, tolls were charged initially in an effort to recoup the cost of the bridge. Work on the nearby Chelsea Embankment delayed construction and so the bridge, initially called Victoria Bridge, did not open until 1858. Although well-received architecturally, as a toll bridge it was unpopular with the public, and Parliament felt obliged to make it <b>toll-free</b> on Sundays. The bridge was less of a commercial success than had been anticipated, partly because of competition from the newly built Albert Bridge nearby. It was acquired by the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1877, and the tolls were abolished in 1879.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} {{improvements}} to the river were made between the 1540s and the 1570s, when Arundel became a port, and navigation up to Pallingham was improved, but barges had difficulty negotiating the flash locks that were installed. The work {{was carried out by}} Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel, who made the upper section <b>toll-free.</b> Harbour commissioners managed the lower river from Arundel to the sea from 1732, and major improvements to keep the estuary free from silt were sanctioned by an Act of Parliament obtained in 1793. With the coming of the railways and changes in coastal shipping, Littlehampton superseded Arundel as the port of the Arun, and the Littlehampton harbour commissioners are still responsible for the river up to Arundel, collecting tolls for its use.|$|E
5|$|The highway enters Geneseo {{from the}} south, taking the name Genesee Street {{as it passes}} {{the western edge of}} the campus of SUNY Geneseo. At the edge of the campus, the route crosses the Genesee River and exits Geneseo. Past the river in the town of York, NY63 begins to curve {{northwest}} up and out of the Genesee River valley until it runs east–west once again at the hamlet of Piffard. The major junction in York is the community of Greigsville, where NY63 reconnects with NY36. This next section of highway has become a major shortcut for traffic heading to the Buffalo area, despite remaining a two-lane road through open rural country, since it is both physically shorter than going all the way to the New York State Thruway as well as <b>toll-free.</b> Most of this Buffalo-bound traffic follows NY36 north from Mount Morris and turns on to NY63 here. Signage along this route reflects this use.|$|E
5|$|The river above Arundel was {{improved}} after 1785. As {{the main}} channel was <b>toll-free,</b> the proprietors of the scheme built two major cuts. One, which included three locks and passed through Hardham Tunnel, {{was built to}} avoid a large bend near Pulborough. The other was near the upper terminus, where a cut with three locks crossed the original channel by an aqueduct to reach wharves at Newbridge. Further improvements were made when the Wey and Arun Canal opened in 1816, joining the Arun at Newbridge, and {{after the completion of}} the Portsmouth and Arundel Canal, which opened soon afterwards. These two canals were an attempt to provide an inland route between London and Portsmouth, but were not as successful as the proprietors hoped. Traffic declined rapidly when the railways offered competition, and the navigation ceased to be maintained from 1888, though some traffic continued on the lower sections. The Wey and Arun Canal is currently being restored, and restoration will eventually include the cut and locks below Newbridge.|$|E
5|$|The western {{extension}} was {{the first}} to open to traffic. Following a brief dedication ceremony attended by Governor Keating, Transportation Secretary McCaleb, and OTA board member Bartlett, the highway opened on December 15, 2000. As with the first section of the turnpike, tolls were waived for the weekend; the road was free until noon on December 18. The south loop was opened in two segments. The first, from US-64/US-169 to South Elm Place in Broken Arrow, opened at 3p.m. August 15, 2001. The new segment remained <b>toll-free</b> until 7a.m. August 20. A rainy September pushed back the opening of {{the other half of the}} south loop by two months. The second half of the south loop, from Elm Place to New Orleans Street, opened at 2p.m. April 15, 2002. The final segment of the extension, connecting New Orleans Street and the Muskogee Turnpike to the Will Rogers Turnpike, was scheduled to open on August 16 of that year.|$|E
5|$|Traffic is {{regularly}} counted and reported by Hrvatske autoceste, operator of the motorway, and results are published by Hrvatske ceste. The largest annual {{average daily traffic}} (AADT) volume is often recorded in the Sveta HelenaKomin section, although all sections between Sveta Helena and Varaždin display similar AADT. AADT data for sections north of Varaždin show considerable drops in traffic volume. As the motorway traffic volume is measured through analysis of toll ticket sales, the southernmost section of the motorway, Ivanja RekaSveta Helena, {{is not included in}} the report. However, since the section {{is a part of the}} Zagreb bypass, it carries significantly heavier traffic than any other sections of the A4 motorwayin 2004, traffic volume along the <b>toll-free</b> section of the A4 motorway was approximately 24,000vehicles per day (AADT) between the Kraljevečki Novaki and Sveta Helena interchanges and nearly 41,000vehicles per day between the Kraljevečki Novaki and Ivanja Reka interchanges. Traffic volume measured on the Ivanja RekaIvanić Grad section of the A3 motorway increased by 30%, hinting at a similar increase in traffic volume on the A4 route south of Sveta Helena.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{believe that}} from the {{beginning}} of the bridge's life, it was <b>toll-free</b> for Lumberland residents. Eventually the town leased the bridge out to private individuals, who collected tolls indiscriminately. During times when bridge could not be leased, the town retained control. The tollhouse was later removed and sold. It is now a home. Originally, the settlement of Pond Eddy on the Pennsylvania side was named Flagstone, but changed to its current name upon construction. Both Pond Eddys expanded rapidly. A new railroad station was created in Pond Eddy on the Pennsylvania side. The riverfront location on the New York side had two stores, a Methodist church, a telegraph office, eighteen homes and a new hotel with a restaurant. The hotel had new owners around the time of the bridge and eventually became a large stop for travelers. The Pond Eddy Bridge served the town of Lumberland well in the late 19th century, but the area's prosperity did not last. The canal went out of business in 1898, after years of competition from railroads. The Erie station on the Pennsylvania had no roads to go anywhere, and the community began to decline. Decker died at 77 years old in 1900, having lived long enough to experience the rise and fall of Pond Eddy.|$|E
5|$|The A4 is a tolled {{motorway}} {{based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed toll system. As of October 2010, toll charged along the A4 route between the Sveta Helena and Goričan mainline toll plazas varies depending {{on the length of}} route travelled and ranges from 7.00 kuna (€0.96) to 36.00 kuna (€4.93) for passenger cars and 22.00 kuna (€3.01) to 120.00 kuna (€16.44) for semi-trailer trucks. The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros using major credit cards, debit cards and a number of prepaid toll collection systems. The latter includes various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operator and ENC, an electronic toll collection (ETC) system which is shared at most motorways in Croatia and provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas. The northernmost section of the motorway, between the border and Goričan interchange (inclusive) is not tolled. Similarly, the southernmost part of the A4 motorway route, located between Sveta Helena and Ivanja Reka interchanges (inclusive) is also <b>toll-free,</b> as it {{is a part of the}} Zagreb bypass, which services a significant volume of traffic.|$|E
5|$|The Darlington's Bridge at Delaware Station was {{a highway}} {{bridge over the}} Delaware River in the {{community}} of Delaware, New Jersey (known locally as Delaware Station). Formerly a railroad bridge constructed by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad in 1871 to replace an earlier 1855 timber span, the bridge was sold off when the new one upstream was constructed. Henry V. Darlington, an Episcopal minister in Delaware and nearby Belvidere offered to buy the second-hand bridge for $5,000 (1914 USD, equal to $ today). Darlington converted it into a highway bridge, using two fired members of the nearby Meyer's Ferry to be toll collectors. The bridge prospered, becoming a part of State Highway Route6 in 1927 and U.S. Route46 in 1936. In 1932, during the massive state takeover of bridges by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, Darlington refused offers, bargaining his way up to $275,000 (1932 USD, equal to $ today) before accepting the sale. This amount {{was a far cry from}} the nearby Belvidere-Riverton and Portland-Columbia Covered Bridge, which were accepted for $60,000 (equal to $ today) and $50,000 (equal to $ today) respectively. On that moment, tolls along the bridge and Route6 were eliminated. The bridge prospered <b>toll-free</b> for another 21 years, until the construction of the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge upstream at Columbia. Although Reverend Darlington was still alive to see all this transpire, the Commission ceased operations on the Darlington Bridge on April3, 1954, and the bridge was immediately demolished.|$|E
5|$|The first {{segment of}} what later became I-94 within the state, the Willow Run Expressway, was built near Ypsilanti and Belleville in 1941, with an easterly {{extension}} to Detroit in 1945. This expressway was initially numbered M-112. In the mid-1950s, {{state and federal}} officials planned an Interstate to replace the original route of U.S. Highway12 (US12). By 1960, the length of I-94 was completed from Detroit to New Buffalo. Two years later, the US12 designation was dropped from the freeway. Subsequent extensions in the 1960s completed {{most of the rest of}} the route, including the remaining sections between Detroit and Port Huron which superseded the routing of US25. The last segment opened to the public in 1972 when Indiana completed its connection across the state line. Since completion, I-94 has remained relatively unchanged; a few interchanges have been rebuilt, a second span was constructed for the Blue Water Bridge, and in 1987, a plane crashed on the freeway during take off from the airport in Detroit. The routing of I-94 is notable for containing the first full freeway-to-freeway interchange in the United States, connecting to the Lodge Freeway (M-10), and for comprising the first complete border-to-border <b>toll-free</b> freeway in a state in the United States. The highway has one auxiliary route, I-194, which serves downtown Battle Creek, and eight business routes. Various segments have been dedicated to multiple people and places.|$|E
