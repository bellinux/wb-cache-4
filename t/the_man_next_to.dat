500|$|Gröning led {{a normal}} middle-class {{life after the}} war. A keen stamp collector, he was once at his local philately club's annual meeting, more than 40 years after the war, when he fell into a {{conversation}} about politics with <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him. The man {{told him it was}} [...] "terrible" [...] that Holocaust denial was illegal in Germany, and went on to tell Gröning how so many bodies could not have been burnt, and that the volume of gas that {{was supposed to have been}} used would have killed all living things in the vicinity.|$|E
500|$|For {{the landing}} each man carried a {{rucksack}} weighing [...] containing extra ammunition, for the Brens, mortars, Vickers K guns and PIATs. This {{was on top}} of their own personal weapon and ammunition. Unusually each man chose whether to would wear a steel helmet or the Commando green beret. No. 4 Commando were in the second wave and landed behind the initial assault battalion, from the East Yorkshire Regiment, part of the 3rd Infantry Division. Captain Porteous described how their dead and wounded were [...] "just swilling around in the water." [...] Captain McDougal later wrote, [...] "as we were coming ashore the assault troops were committing suicide by trying to dig in on the beach. In passing I kicked the nearest man telling him to keep going. The man was dead. So was <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him and a third was seriously wounded by machine gun fire." [...] The Commandos followed their drills and cleared the beach as quickly as possible. Once clear they headed for their assembly area, which was also the commando medical post. Leaving their rucksacks behind, they set off along the Lion sur Mer road towards their objectives.|$|E
500|$|Sam Lansky of {{the website}} Idolator, noted how the video was a [...] "high-concept" [...] one further [...] "balancing out the {{low-level}} minimalism of the... track with arresting visuals and a star-studded cast". Mike Wass {{of the same}} website deemed it a recreation of the riot scene of the singer's own [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] (2011). He further described Destiny's Child reunion as [...] "heartwarming". Michelle Collins, a journalist of Vanity Fair echoed his statements, noting how the band reunion was the video's key moment. Although Anupa Mistry of Spin felt that the video for [...] "Superpower" [...] {{was one of the}} [...] "relatively mundane" [...] on the visual album, it was a feat of [...] "production value and styling". Kathy Iandoli from Vice, praised the singer's overall look in the clip. MuuMuse's [...] Bradley Stern felt the clip was one of the singer's [...] "most artistic moment", praising her [...] "ridiculously sexy stealth superhero outfit". He interpreted the wall of police officers as critics, political statements and life obstacles and concluded that the last image where the singer is seen holding hands with <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> her is a [...] "lasting" [...] one. The Fader writer Michael Zelenko said that the clip resembled a short movie with Beyoncé as [...] "an Occupy-style protest heroine leading a ragtag gang". Listing it as the fifth best video on the album, Melinda Newman of HitFix elaborated how the video managed to transform the [...] "simple love ballad into a political statement", furthering how it added meaning to its lyrics. rent DiCrescenzo of the magazine Time Out named it the sixth best on the album. Trent Wolbe of The Verge criticized Åkerlund's work on the album, feeling that his contributions [...] "feel like boring opulence porn", something he found on [...] "Superpower".|$|E
50|$|During the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge on 20 September 1917 {{south-east}} of Ypres, Belgium, {{when the}} advance of his company was held up by a machine-gun at point-blank range, Sergeant Burman shouted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him {{to wait a few}} minutes and going forward to what seemed certain death killed the enemy gunner and carried the gun to the company's objective where he used it with great effect. Fifteen minutes later it was seen that about 40 of the enemy were enfilading the battalion on the right. Sergeant Burman and two others ran and got behind them, killing six and capturing two officers and 29 other ranks.|$|R

2500|$|The nave of the {{basilica}} {{was covered in}} mosaics representing Old Testament events of Moses leading the Jews out of Egypt across the Red Sea. [...] "The nave mosaics (which represents stories of Old Testament history and accordingly offered Christians in Rome a new 'past') are illusionistic in a colorful and impressionist manner" [...] as this scholar puts it the scene was filled with movement, emotion, and it was to inspire thinking of Rome's [...] "new" [...] past; the past of the Old Testament. As one scholar describes it: [...] "Moses strikes {{the waters of the}} Red Sea in a heroic gesture, his toga in light and dark grays and blues, but lined in black, the folds white lines, the tunic underneath light blue; <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him wears a deep blue toga over a gray and white tunic." [...] Another panel shows the demise of the Egyptians in the Red Sea. An observer describes the mosaic: [...] "The Egyptians, clad in blue armor with gold bands and scarlet cloaks wildly flying, drown in the greenish blue waters; the horses, white or light brown shaded with darker browns, highlighted in white, the accoutrements a bright red." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Down {{with the}} villains!" [...] shouted Rooney, laying {{the grasp of}} a vice on the neck of <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him, and hurling him to the ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Lord!" [...] {{said the}} old lady to <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> her, [...] "what a voice the poor {{creature}} has! {{it is like a}} bull's. What does he say?" ...|$|E
50|$|On {{a one-day}} {{business}} {{trip to the}} country-side, Desouza embarks on an unintended journey. When he reaches his destination Desouza discovers that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> traveling <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him is not sleeping but dead.|$|R

5000|$|The pans would [...] "bubble" [...] with milky {{liquid and}} the vapor {{in the air}} was so dense that {{according}} to a local newspaper, <b>the</b> <b>men</b> working <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kettles appeared [...] "phantom-like hovering in a gauzy perspective." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No wonder. In {{a second}} every man there feared <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him would shoot. That showed {{the power of}} Kells's Border Legion. If his men had been {{faithful}} and obedient {{he never would have}} fallen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pass {{it through}} the crowd, please. I want every one to be {{convinced}} of its quality before I attempt to sell it!" [...] bawled the auctioneer, and the gentleman handed it to <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E
60|$|The man forward {{waved his}} hand, and, holding to the mast, stood up. A minute later {{he turned and}} shouted {{something}} to <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him, and the message was passed from mouth to mouth to the mate.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{found him}} a {{pleasant}} and very well informed man, Ralph, and enjoyed my {{talk with him}} just as you enjoyed talking nonsense to his daughters and listening to their songs. Who was <b>the</b> <b>man</b> sitting <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eldest daughter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is so," [...] the planter agreed. [...] "I myself, {{standing}} well in {{the favor}} of the governor, have received four of them; that boy, <b>the</b> two <b>men</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him, and that big man working there. He is a noted malignant, and was known as Colonel Purness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They know that," [...] {{chimed in}} <b>the</b> <b>man</b> lying <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him; [...] "or {{they would not}} drug us. Why, when we stormed La Haye I knew nothing until an ugly-looking German spat a pint of blood into my face and woke me up." ...|$|R
60|$|It was a prophetic utterance, for he {{made such}} a fuss over <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> his wife {{offering}} her his opera-glasses, that they left, at the urgent request of the management, in almost exactly that space of time.|$|E
6000|$|... "He's quite right," [...] said Two Tails. [...] "I can't always obey, because I'm betwixt and between. But Billy's right. Obey <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> you {{who gives}} the order, or you'll stop all the battery, besides getting a thrashing." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jean {{forthwith}} {{took the}} glass and moved it slowly across the faces of that group of horsemen. [...] "Simm Bruce," [...] he said, instantly. [...] "I see Colter. And, yes, Greaves is there. I've seen <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him--face like a ham...." ...|$|E
60|$|Then another medal {{was given}} to the Chief, who pinned it to the coat of <b>the</b> <b>man</b> {{standing}} <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> boy in line, the mayor meanwhile explaining why it had thus been bestowed, and Seth began to understand how greatly he was honored.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>man</b> sits <b>next</b> <b>to</b> a table, {{with a rich}} fur-lined jacket, {{and holds}} a statuette, which perhaps portrays a Diana of Ephesus. The hands {{touching}} the chest is a sentimental theme typical of Lotto's works. The tables has also a book and some ancient coins.|$|R

6000|$|Her {{informant}} lifted {{himself on}} his toes to see better. [...] "I don't know," [...] he confessed sorrowfully, then tapped the shoulder of <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him. [...] "Who is the lean, smooth-faced one? The one with the blue shirt and the patch on his knee?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You had no {{business}} to think," [...] said Miss Rumbolt. [...] "You are bad men, and you’ll all be hung, every one of you; I shall come and see it."

60|$|The {{place was}} very full of people--so full that there seemed {{scarcely}} room for another guest; but by some almost imperceptible motion the red-haired man {{made a little}} space close to himself. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him, with a hook-nose, widened the space by similar action, and Miles, perceiving that there was room, sat down.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout {{his career}} Hopkin Morris was a staunch individualist, once summing up his {{political}} philosophy as, [...] "There is no man alive who is sufficiently good {{to rule the}} life of <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>next</b> door <b>to</b> him!" [...] Many have regarded him as being the last representative of traditional Gladstonian Liberalism in the Commons.|$|R
50|$|According to the 1853 {{exhibition}} catalogue, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> standing <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Washington {{and holding}} the flag is Lieutenant James Monroe, future President of the United States, and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> leaning over <b>the</b> side is General Nathanael Greene. Also, General Edward Hand is shown seated and holding his hat within the vessel.|$|R
50|$|This {{multitude}} of missiles helped cover the legions advancing towards {{the walls of}} the besieged settlements. The famous testudo ("tortoise") formation was utilized to protect the advancing legions. This was done by having the front rank hold out their shields {{in such a way as}} to overlap the shields of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> them and protect most of the body. The ranks behind the first rank raised their scutum above their own head so that it covered <b>the</b> <b>man</b> in front of him. These shields overlapped those in front of them, creating a shield roof over the entire unit's head. The soldiers at the end of each rank held out their shield sideways to complete the shell of shields. This and other formations were used to assault walls.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a murmur}} of {{approval}} {{from many of}} those standing round. The Tyler, who had made a step forward, looked back angrily and would have spoken, but <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him whispered something in his ear. Without saying more he walked on, while Edgar touched his horse with his heel and proceeded on his way.|$|E
6000|$|It {{asserted}} itself {{first as}} a penetrating and emphatic smell of burning rubber,--it {{was caused by the}} fusing of an electric wire. The reek forced its way into the discussion of the Pekin massacres that had sprung up between Evesham, Waulsort, and the others {{at the end of the}} table. [...] "Something burning," [...] said <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> me.|$|E
60|$|All the {{passengers}} except Hale started. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him moved {{his right hand}} suddenly behind him, but as quickly stopped. One of the motionless trees had apparently closed upon the vehicle, and what had {{seemed to be a}} bough projecting from it at right angles changed slowly into the faintly shining double-barrels of a gun at the window.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, does lamb {{make the}} mint sauce, or mint sauce make the lamb?" [...] he asked <b>the</b> young <b>man</b> <b>next</b> him, <b>to</b> break a silence {{which had already}} lasted five minutes and a half.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>man</b> seemed <b>to</b> take an age coming out. As {{a matter}} of fact, he walked more rapidly than a batsman usually walks to the crease.|$|R
5000|$|Police arrest Pierre {{and put him}} in handcuffs. An {{ambulance}} arrives, and Marcus is put on {{a stretcher}} and taken from the club. Outside, Mourad and Layde shout homophobic insults at Pierre and Marcus. <b>The</b> murdered <b>man</b> is revealed not to be Le Tenia after all. Rather, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> standing <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him in the club was the real Le Tenia.|$|R
