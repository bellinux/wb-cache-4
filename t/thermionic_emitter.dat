40|$|It {{is shown}} that {{thermionic}} converters at moderate emitter temperatures of about 1600 K {{can be designed}} for a radiatively coupled 100 kWe device. A nuclear reactor is a primary heat source, with heat pipes extracting heat from the reactor and distributing it over a large surface opposite an array of thermionic energy converters. The radiative heat transfer across the vacuum gap heats up the <b>thermionic</b> <b>emitters,</b> and excess heat from the converters is radiated from the collector electrodes to the vacuum of space; the heat transfer {{is controlled by the}} energy density to be transferred, and by the temperature differential between the heat source and the heat receiver.

40|$|Ion plating {{involves}} the transportation of vapour through a low pressure glow discharge to form solid coatings on negatively biased substrates. Although the method has gained commercial acceptance, particularly for engineering applications, {{much of the}} underlying science of the process is poorly understood. This work is concerned with investigating certain mechanisms occurring within the ion plating environment, and their role in process optimisation. The work has concentrated primarily on electron beam evaporation in thermionically enhanced discharges. Investigations have centred on various aspects of discharges used in ion plating {{and the influence of}} gas scattering mechanisms on the vapour species during deposition. This has been achieved by analysing the published literature and performing experiments involving cathode sheath thickness measurements, sputter weight loss determinations, optical emission spectroscopy and coating thickness evaluation. The main findings are:(i) Thermionically enhanced discharges can considerably reduce cathode sheath thickness, providing benefits in terms of bombardment uniformity and energy transportation. However, the influence of plasma bombardment is anisotropic and also falls off exponentially with distance from the <b>thermionic</b> <b>emitter.</b> This can be offset by a comparable reduction in coating flux arrival rates if the <b>thermionic</b> <b>emitter</b> is positioned close to the vapour source. (ii) The incorporation of nitrogen in (reactive) ion plating discharges may reduce the rate of ion generation, particularly in the presence of thermionic emitters. Nitrogen dissociative charge transfer collisions within the cathode sheath may be signif icant but their practical importance is questionable. (iii) There is evidence to suggest that the metal vapour in an argon ion plating discharge transports most of the ion current to the substrate and {{at least some of the}} material arrives as atomic clusters. (iv) A model which unifies coating thickness uniformity with source to substrate distance has been developed. This predicts the existence of a virtual source phenomenon...|$|E

The hexaborides of the lighter lanthanides (La – Sm) melt without decomposition, EuB6 decomposes to boron and metal and the heavier lanthanides decompose to LnB4 with exception of YbB6 which decomposes forming YbB12. The stability has in part been correlated to differences in volatility between the lanthanide metals. In EuB6 and YbB6 the metals have an oxidation state of +2 whereas {{in the rest of the}} lanthanide hexaborides it is +3. This rationalises the differences in conductivity, the extra electrons in the LnIII hexaborides entering conduction bands. EuB6 is a semiconductor and the rest are good conductors.

40|$|Abstract. For arcs at {{atmospheric}} pressure which have cathodes that are <b>thermionic</b> <b>emitters,</b> {{it is possible}} to calculate the major properties of the arc and the electrodes as a function of current, by accounting for electrode shape and the heat transfer processes occurring at the surface of the electrodes. Such processes occur due to eleclron and ion emission and absorption and also from radiation emission and absorption. Electrical resistance of the plasma near the electrodes is calculated either by laking account of ambipolar diffusion or simply using the local plasma value, with mesh sizes sufficiently large to account for ambipolar diffusion. Derived temperature profiles are in fair agreement with experiment. Results of electrode temperatures and arc melting effects, including such phenomena as the transition from globular to spray modes in arc welding, are also in good agreement with experiment. Prediction of properties for non-thermionic cathodes still constitute a major problem. Approximate calculations indicate that electrons at the surface of the non-thermionic cathodes may be produced by photo ionisation of neutral atoms rather than by field emission. 1...|$|R
