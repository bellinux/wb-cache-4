The site added, [...] "We long ago gave up predicting what the Emmy Awards will do.

500|$|Rihanna's voice spans one-and-a-half octaves in [...] "Only Girl (In the World)", from F3 to C5, and her vocal has a [...] "silky", [...] "seductive" [...] tone. In the song's lyrics Rihanna yearns for her lover's attention, {{which makes}} her feel like the only girl in the world. The singer [...] "pours her heart out" [...] in the chorus: [...] "Want you {{to make me feel}} like I'm the only girl in the world/ Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love/ Like I'm the only one who knows your heart/ Only girl in the world." [...] According to Digital Spy writer Nick Levine, the chorus [...] "thumps like a rabbit having an epileptic fit." [...] Rihanna sings suggestively, [...] "Baby, I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> my secrets that I'm keepin'/ You can come inside/ And when you enter, you ain't leavin'/ Be my {{prisoner}} for the night."

500|$|... "Stand Up for Love" [...] {{received}} negative reviews by most music critics. James Blake {{writing for}} BBC Online, described [...] "Stand Up for Love" [...] as a [...] "sugary ballad". Pitchfork Medias writer Jess Harvell criticized the song by writing, [...] "Opener 'Stand Up for Love' is subtitled the '2005 World Children's Day Anthem', which should <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> {{you really need}} to know, i.e. Diane Warren should be banned under the Geneva Conventions". Fiona Mckinlay criticized the fact that the song was used as an opener for #1's and felt it wasn't [...] "really causing any kind of reaction before they get started properly with Independent Woman Pt.1".

2500|$|There {{has been}} debate over {{what kinds of}} damage may have {{resulted}} from the public disclosure of Valerie Wilson's identity as a CIA operative in Novak's column and its fallout, how far and into what areas of national security and foreign intelligence that damage might extend, particularly vis-à-vis Plame's work with her cover company, Brewster Jennings & Associates.

2500|$|The Court {{warned the}} {{students}} not to delay contacting their families because the Court {{was going to}} write them promptly.

[...] To Kenneth Day he wrote: [...] "It {{would be better for}} them to hear it from you than from me." [...] The Dean's letters about students who had committed no overt act explained the circumstances at length and provided he Court's rationale for expulsion in such cases: [...] "The acts in question are so unspeakably gross that the intimates of those who commit these acts become tainted." [...] He made a clear distinction by not criticizing such a student's character, but his judgment, calling him [...] "no worse than ignorant, over-curious, and careless." [...] When it came to those who had engaged in homosexual sex, Greenough withheld details yet tried to underscore the significance of the violation. To Roberts' father, Greenough wrote that his son [...] "has promised to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> about the matter, and I hope he will tell you the whole truth.
