5|$|A unique {{bond between}} two very {{disparate}} groups was {{formed as a}} result of the hurricane. <b>Two</b> <b>groups,</b> the Bastrop Christian Outreach Center (BCOC) and attendees of the counter-culture Rainbow Gathering, arrived around the same time in Waveland.|$|E
5|$|After the scuttling of the monitors, around 450 {{officers}} and {{men from the}} Sava and various other riverine vessels gathered at Obrenovac. Armed only with personal weapons and some machine guns stripped from the scuttled vessels, the crews started towards the Bay of Kotor in the southern Adriatic in <b>two</b> <b>groups.</b> The smaller of the <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> reached its objective, but the larger group only made {{it as far as}} Sarajevo by 14 April before they were obliged to surrender.

5|$|At {{the start}} of May, Operation Bernhard was officially closed down and the prisoners were transported from the caves to the nearby Ebensee {{concentration}} camp. They were divided into three groups, and a truck was to make trips {{to and from the}} camp. An order had been issued that the prisoners were to be killed, but only once they were together at Ebensee. The truck delivered the first <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> to the camp, where the men were housed separately from the general camp population. On the third journey the vehicle broke down after it had picked up the final group of prisoners; the men in the last group were marched to the camp, which took two days. As the order had specified that the prisoners had to be killed together, the first <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> were kept safe to await their comrades. Because of the delay with the third journey and the close proximity of the advancing Allied army, on 5 May the first <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> were released from their isolation into the general population and their SS guards fled. That afternoon the third group arrived at the camp. When the guards learned {{what had happened to the}} first <b>two</b> <b>groups,</b> they also released their prisoners into the main prison population and fled. The Americans arrived the following day and liberated the camp.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2012 tournament, the {{qualifying}} round will be eliminated, and the 16 {{teams will be}} divided into <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> of eight, with each team playing seven games in the preliminary round.|$|E
50|$|The tournament's format {{would change}} {{depending}} upon the number of teams that agree to partake in the competition. Should nine teams enter, the <b>two</b> <b>group</b> winners advance to the final. Should only eight teams enter, the <b>two</b> <b>group</b> winners and <b>two</b> <b>group</b> runners-up advance to the semi-finals. Since at the end only seven teams entered, the top two teams of each group advanced to the semi-finals.|$|R
50|$|The eight group {{winners and}} eight group runners-up were drawn into four groups, with each one {{containing}} <b>two</b> <b>group</b> winners and <b>two</b> <b>group</b> runners-up. The top two teams {{in each group}} advanced to the Champions League knockout stage.|$|R

5|$|During {{the night}} of 15 December, {{the main body of}} the High Seas Fleet {{encountered}} British destroyers. Fearing the prospect of a nighttime torpedo attack, Admiral Ingenohl ordered the ships to retreat. Hipper was unaware of Ingenohl's reversal, and so he continued with the bombardment. Upon reaching the British coast, Hipper's battlecruisers split into <b>two</b> <b>groups.</b> Derfflinger and Von der Tann went south to shell Scarborough and Whitby while Seydlitz, Moltke, and Blücher went north to shell Hartlepool.

5|$|One of {{the major}} {{legacies}} of colonial rule in Kasai was the arbitrary redivision of the population into new ethnic groups. Despite the shared language (Tshiluba) {{and culture of the}} <b>two</b> <b>groups,</b> colonial administrators believed the inhabitants of the Lulua river area to be ethnically different from the Baluba and dubbed them the Bena Lulua. The colonists believed the Baluba to be more intelligent, hardworking and open to new ideas than the Bena Lulua who were believed to be more reactionary and stupid. As a result, from the 1930s, the state began to treat the <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> differently and applied different policies to each and promoted the Baluba to positions above other ethnicities.|$|E

5|$|An {{additional}} intensity to {{the rivalry}} {{is the fact}} that both Maribor and Olimpija always had support on their matches from ultras groups, called Viole Maribor (supporting Maribor), and the Green Dragons, who support Olimpija. The <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> are the largest in the country, and it is not uncommon that the matches between the two clubs were sometimes interrupted by violent clashes between the <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> or with the police. On many occasions, before or after the matches, the fans of the two clubs would also meet up and fight on the streets. One of the worst incidents, in April 2010 after a match, resulted in a stabbing of a member of the Green Dragons who, with a group of friends, got into a fight with members of the Viole in Ljubljana's railway station. However, to date, there have not been any fatalities in the country related to football violence.|$|E
5|$|By {{broadcasting}} {{accusations of}} communism among Fretilin leaders and sowing discord in the UDT coalition, the Indonesian government fostered instability in East Timor and, observers said, created {{a pretext for}} invading.

5|$|Discontinuation of benzodiazepines or abrupt {{reduction}} of the dose, even after a relatively short course of treatment (three to four weeks), may result in <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> of symptoms—rebound and withdrawal.
