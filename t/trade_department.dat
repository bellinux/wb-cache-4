5|$|Harrison {{established}} a foreign <b>trade</b> <b>department</b> for the railroad, hoping {{to take advantage}} of the railway's ability to connect to the Mississippi Valley and Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico ports. In 1915, when the railway lost 12percent of its revenue owing to disruptions in trade caused by the start of World War I, Harrison was concerned about longer-term changes underway. In the annual report that year he warned stockholders that automobile ownership could severely impact railroad passenger revenues. His words proved to be prophetic, as automobiles eventually resulted in the disappearance of most passenger train traffic.|$|E

25|$|The {{accident}} {{was one of}} a series suffered by Bristow helicopters in the North Sea in just over a year. This included the 12 August 1981 loss of another Bell 212 and the 13 August 1981 loss of a Westland Wessex. Soon after the crash, former Labour Secretary of State for Social Services David Ennals called for a <b>Trade</b> <b>Department</b> inquiry into the safety of helicopter operations in the North Sea oil industry. The accident brought the total number of dead from North Sea helicopter accidents by all UK operators to 40 at that time.|$|E
25|$|The {{structural}} engineering firm Worthington, Skilling, Helle & Jackson worked to implement Yamasaki's design, developing the tube-frame structural system {{used in the}} twin towers. The Port Authority's Engineering Department served as foundation engineers, Joseph R. Loring & Associates as electrical engineers, and Jaros, Baum & Bolles (JB) as mechanical engineers. Tishman Realty & Construction Company was the general contractor on the World Trade Center project. Guy F. Tozzoli, director of the World <b>Trade</b> <b>Department</b> at the Port Authority, and Rino M. Monti, the Port Authority's Chief Engineer, oversaw the project. As an interstate agency, the Port Authority was not subject to local laws and regulations of the City of New York, including building codes. Nonetheless, the structural engineers of the World Trade Center ended up following draft versions of the new 1968 building codes.|$|E

25|$|Madoyan {{was born}} on 15 January 1906 {{in the village of}} Kers in Kars Oblast (present-day Turkey) to a peasant family. He {{received}} incomplete secondary education and joined the Red Army in 1920, fighting in Armenia and the Red Army invasion of Georgia in 1921. After graduating from an infantry school in 1924, Madoyan was demobilized in 1925. He {{became a member of the}} Communist Party of the Soviet Union that year, and until 1928 worked in the cooperative and public catering sector. Between 1928 and 1930, Madoyan was the chief of the industrial department of a worker cooperative in Yerevan. In 1930, he rejoined the army, serving as a company commander in the Armenian Rifle Regiment for the next three years. Madoyan was head of the Yerevan weapons <b>trade</b> <b>department</b> between 1933 and 1937, and head of a department of the Yerevan Main Deli from then until 1940, when he rejoined the army. He graduated from the Vystrel refresher courses in 1940.|$|E
500|$|Haug and D'Mario parachuted {{onto the}} grounds of the air base and made contact with the base {{commander}} within tenminutes of each other. They informed him that at least six crew ejected successfully and the aircraft was carrying four nuclear weapons. Off-duty staff were mustered to conduct search and rescue operations for the remaining crew members. Owing to the extreme weather conditions, Arctic darkness, and unnavigable ice, the base relied largely on the Thule representative of the Royal Greenland <b>Trade</b> <b>Department,</b> Ministry of Greenland, Jens Zinglersen, to raise and mount the search using native dog sled teams. Three of the survivors landed within [...] of the base and were rescued within twohours. For his initial actions and later services, Zinglersen received the Air Force Exceptional Civilian Service Medal on 26 February 1968 {{at the hands of the}} U.S. Ambassador, K. E. White. Captain Criss, who was first to eject, landed [...] from the base—he remained lost on an ice floe for 21hours and suffered hypothermia in the [...] temperatures, but he survived by wrapping himself in his parachute.|$|E
2500|$|From early 1939 onwards, Ribbentrop {{had become}} the leading {{advocate}} within the German government of reaching an understanding with the Soviet Union {{as the best way}} of pursuing both the short-term anti-Polish and long-term anti-British foreign policy goals. Ribbentrop first seems to have considered the idea of a pact with the Soviet Union after an unsuccessful visit to Warsaw in January 1939, when the Poles again refused Ribbentrop's demands about Danzig, the [...] "extra-territorial" [...] roads across the Polish Corridor and the Anti-Comintern Pact. During the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact negotiations, Ribbentrop was overjoyed by a report from his ambassador in Moscow, Count Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg, of a speech by the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin before the 18th Party Congress in March 1939 that was strongly anti-Western, which Schulenburg reported meant that the Soviet Union might be seeking an accord with Germany. Ribbentrop followed up Schulenburg's report by sending Dr. Julius Schnurre of the Foreign Office's <b>trade</b> <b>department</b> to negotiate a German-Soviet economic agreement. At the same time, Ribbentrop's efforts to convert the Anti-Comintern Pact into an anti-British alliance met with considerable hostility from the Japanese {{over the course of the}} winter of 1938–39, but with the Italians, Ribbentrop enjoyed some apparent success. Because of Japanese opposition to participation in an anti-British alliance, Ribbentrop decided to settle for a bilateral German-Italian anti-British treaty. Ribbentrop's efforts were crowned with success with the signing of the Pact of Steel in May 1939, though this was accomplished only by falsely assuring Mussolini that there would be no war for the next three years.|$|E
