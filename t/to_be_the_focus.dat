5|$|The town used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of {{thriving}} river {{business and}} was an important stop on the Dublin to Limerick navigation. It supported a number of large industries, most notably a maltings and distillery, which are now defunct. Tourism has supplanted this {{to a certain extent}} with a modern marina providing support for river cruisers and watersports facilities and the town is an important angling centre, with particular attraction for pike anglers. Banagher is the centre of the Shannon Callows, grassy meadows which flood in winter and provide living space for myriads of waterfowl.|$|E

5|$|Advances {{during the}} last decades {{has led to the}} recent {{approval}} of several oral drugs. These drugs are expected to gain in popularity and frequency of use at the expense of previously existing therapies. Further oral drugs are still under investigation, the most notable example being laquinimod, which was announced in August 2012 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of a third phase III trial after mixed results in the previous ones. Similarly, Other studies are aimed to improve efficacy and ease of use of already existing therapies through the use of novel preparations. Such is the case the PEGylated version of interferon-β-1a, that has a longer life than normal interferon and therefore it is being studied if given at less frequent doses has a similar efficacy than the existing product. With the completion of a robust two-year study, it is shown that the PEGylated interferon beta-1a has greater efficacy in decreasing relapse rate and disability progression compared to placebo for MS patients.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{returned to}} the area in mid-July, tasked with minor operations intended to keep German {{attention away from the}} sector north of Ypres, which was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of renewed fighting as Haig continued with his planned offensive. Russell had his brigades man the division's section in rotation; those not in the trenches spent their time training. During this period, the New Zealanders captured the village of La Basseville but subsequently lost it to a German counterattack. At the end of the month, 2nd Wellington Battalion, 1st Brigade, retook the village with Lance-Corporal Leslie Andrew playing {{a key role in the}} action; he was later awarded the VC for his efforts. Over the following few weeks the men of the division worked to consolidate their positions in waterlogged trenches, rain having set in. Casualties were still incurred during this period including Brigadier General Johnston, killed by a sniper on 7 August while inspecting his new command, the Rifle Brigade.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{do not see}} {{the case}} as setting a precedent because the unique circumstances surrounding the Trail smelter have been articulated and discussed multiple times, therefore the arguments that arise for transboundary international law are divorced from the context they are derived from; this distorts the decisions made in cases like the Trail Arbitration. For the arbitration, the decisions that appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of literature on transboundary international law precedents are sub-articles 2 and 4 from Article 3 of the International Joint Commission's (IJC) recommendations.|$|E

25|$|From the start, the new {{library was}} {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of a large-scale mixed-use development which involved {{the creation of}} a new pedestrianised piazza and the reinstatement as a through route of Jubilee Street, severed when the surrounding derelict land became a makeshift car park. (The street was laid out in the 1840s across Jubilee Field, so named when a wealthy resident's free party for the town's poor people to celebrate George III's Jubilee in 1809 brought in so many people that they spilled out of the Royal Pavilion stables and on to the adjacent field.) The name Jubilee Library was chosen to reflect this; a councillor's suggestion of Thabo Mbeki Library, in reference to the then incumbent South African President's period of study at the University of Sussex, was rejected.|$|E

500|$|Between 1874 and 1878 restorer Salvador Martinez Cubells was {{tasked with}} {{retouching}} the goat's horns {{and a number}} of the witches' faces. He removed more than [...] of landscape and sky {{to the right of the}} postulant witch, where the paint had been badly damaged.

500|$|The song's lyrical {{theme is}} reincarnation, {{in keeping with}} its composer's {{absorption}} in Hindu philosophy – a preoccupation that had led the Beatles to the Maharishi's teachings and would result in Harrison's introduction to the Hare Krishna movement in December 1968. Harrison had first taken reincarnation as his theme for [...] "Art of Dying", which he began writing in 1966, and it would continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> {{of many of his}} compositions as a solo artist, notably the 1973 hit [...] "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)". Theologian Dale Allison highlights [...] "Circles" [...] as the only Harrison song to use the term [...] "reincarnate", however, and he also notes the composer's use of the word [...] "soul" [...] "in its proper metaphysical sense".|$|E
500|$|Townsend {{designed}} his {{two main}} projects, the aggressive Strapping Young Lad and his more melodic solo material, as counterparts. Strapping Young Lad's music was a diverse mix of extreme metal genres: death metal, thrash metal, black metal and industrial metal. Townsend's solo material blends many genres and influences, with elements of atmospheric ambient music, hard rock and progressive rock, along with pop metal and arena rock. He {{described it as}} [...] "a highly orchestrated type of expansive music based in hard rock and heavy metal. Dense and produced with {{a large amount of}} ambient elements." [...] Despite Strapping Young Lad's greater mainstream acceptance, Townsend identifies more with his solo material, and has never intended Strapping Young Lad <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of his music.|$|E

[...] In his first attempt at writing a book, The Nomadic Alternative, Chatwin had tried to compose an academic exposition on nomadic culture, which he believed was unexamined and unappreciated.

500|$|Betty Elms (Naomi Watts) is {{the bright}} and talented {{newcomer}} to Los Angeles, described as [...] "wholesome, optimistic, determined {{to take the}} town by storm", and [...] "absurdly naïve". Her perkiness and intrepid approach to helping Rita {{because it is the}} right thing to do is reminiscent of Nancy Drew for reviewers. Her entire persona at first is an apparent cliché of small-town naïveté. But it is Betty's identity, or loss of it, that appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of the film. For one critic, Betty performed the role of the film's consciousness and unconscious. Naomi Watts, who modeled Betty on Doris Day, Tippi Hedren and Kim Novak, observed that Betty is a thrill-seeker, someone [...] "who finds herself in a world she doesn't belong in and is ready to take on a new identity, even if it's somebody else's". This has also led one theorist to conclude that since Betty had naïvely, yet eagerly entered the Hollywood system, she had become a [...] "complicit actor" [...] who had [...] "embraced the very structure that" [...] destroyed her. In an explanation of her development of the Betty character, Watts stated: ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "magnificent and accurate" [...] Shakespeare edition which Boydell {{began in}} 1786 was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of his enterprise—he viewed the print folio and the gallery as offshoots {{of the main}} project. In an {{advertisement}} prefacing {{the first volume of}} the edition, Nicol wrote that [...] "splendor and magnificence, united with correctness of text were the great objects of this Edition". [...] The volumes themselves were handsome, with gilded pages that, unlike those in previous scholarly editions, were unencumbered by footnotes. [...] Each play had its own title page followed by a list of [...] "Persons in the Drama". [...] Boydell spared no expense. [...] He hired the typography experts William Bulmer and William Martin to develop and cut a new typeface specifically for the edition. [...] Nicol explains in the preface that they [...] "established a printing-house ... a foundry to cast the types; and even a manufactory to make the ink". Boydell also chose to use high-quality wove Whatman paper. The illustrations were printed independently and could be inserted and removed as the purchaser desired. The first volumes of the Dramatic Works were published in 1791 and the last in 1805.|$|E

500|$|In late 1991 {{and early}} 1992, Paterson and Weston wrote their next single, [...] "Blue Room".

Despite its playing time of almost 40 minutes, [...] "Blue Room" [...] entered the British charts at #12 and peaked at #8, {{making it the}} longest track to reach the charts. The Orb promoted this single with a [...] "legendary avant-garde" [...] performance on Top of the Pops where Patterson and Weston played a game of chess in space suits while footage of dolphins and an edited version of [...] "Blue Room" [...] ran in the background. In July 1992, U.F.Orb was released featuring [...] "Blue Room" [...] and, in the US release, the Orb's next single, [...] "Assassin". Weston integrated his technical and creative expertise with Paterson's Eno-influenced ambience on U.F.Orb, combining [...] "drum and bass rhythms" [...] with [...] "velvet keyboards" [...] and [...] "rippling synth lines". U.F.Orb reached #1 on the British album charts to the shock of critics, who were surprised that fans had embraced what journalists considered to be progressive rock. Despite the Orb's success, Paterson and Weston preferred to avoid personal publicity and instead allow their music <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of attention. Because of this partial anonymity and the Orb's rotating membership, they are often recognised {{as more of a}} musical collective than a [...] "band".|$|E
