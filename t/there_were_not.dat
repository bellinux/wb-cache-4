5|$|A design {{competition}} {{was announced in}} July 1911, but <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> many contenders. The Naval Ministry favored the design from the Russud Works and gave preliminary orders for three ships on 2 September, even before the competition was concluded in November. Russud's design was unsurprisingly selected and the government transferred designers from the government-owned Baltic Works {{as well as a}} complete set of drawings for the Gangut-class to speed up the detailed design process.|$|E
5|$|After the earthquake, several {{websites}} speculated {{about whether}} hydraulic fracturing (fracking) {{for natural gas}} production could have caused or contributed to the quake. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> any fracking operations in Virginia {{at the time of}} the quake. The nearest fracking was occurring in the Marcellus shale in West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|After the {{restoration}} of Charles II to the throne in 1660, {{a survey of the}} castle was carried out, which recommended repairs to the site. A survey carried {{out at the end of}} the 1730s suggested that the castle had ten artillery positions, but that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> enough guns on the island to arm both the castle and the other defences, and that some of the guns that were available were unusable.|$|E

5|$|Between December, 1941 and June, 1945 U.S. railroads carried almost 44 million armed {{services}} personnel. As <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> enough cars and coaches available {{to meet the}} massive need for troop transit created by World War II, in late 1943 the U.S. Office of Defense Transportation contracted with the Pullman Company to build 2,400 troop sleepers, and with American Car and Foundry (ACF) to build 440 troop kitchen cars.|$|E
5|$|Despite her confession, Wise {{pleaded not}} guilty to the charge of murdering Lily Gienke in front of a grand jury on March 23, 1925. She told the grand jury that she was irresistibly {{attracted}} to attending funerals, and that when <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> enough funerals in the community, she was driven to create them by killing. Wise was indicted on a charge of first-degree murder on April 7, 1925.|$|E
5|$|She was wrecked on 26 February 1852, while {{transporting}} {{troops to}} Algoa Bay at Danger Point near Gansbaai, 87 miles (140 kilometres) from Cape Town, South Africa. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> enough serviceable lifeboats {{for all the}} passengers, and the soldiers famously stood firm on board, thereby allowing {{the women and children}} to board the boats safely and escape the sinking.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} Noodles & Company was {{conceived}} by former Pepsi marketing executive Aaron Kennedy, after eating at Mamie's Asian Noodle Shop in Greenwich Village, New York. He felt <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> enough restaurants that served noodle dishes, {{which are a}} staple for many international foods.

5|$|After Houston {{received}} word that Santa Anna was leading a large force to San Antonio, Bowie offered to lead volunteers {{to defend the}} Alamo from the expected attack. He arrived with 30men on January 19, where they found a force of 104men with a few weapons and a few cannons, but not many supplies and little gunpowder. Houston knew that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> enough men to hold the fort in an attack and had given Bowie authority to remove the artillery and blow up the fortification. Bowie and the Alamo commander, James C. Neill, decided {{they did not have}} enough oxen to move the artillery, and {{they did not want to}} destroy the fortress. On January 26, one of Bowie's men, James Bonham, organized a rally which passed a resolution in favor of holding the Alamo. Bonham signed the resolution first, with Bowie's signature second.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} WWF, McIntyre {{continued}} to wrestle sporadically on the independent circuit. At that time, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> {{many opportunities for}} females in the business. She competed in the Women's Pro Wrestling organization in the early 1990s. In November 1993, she won the Canadian Wrestling Alliance's Women's Championship from Iron Maiden, but lost it to Iron Maiden again in January 1994. They continued to feud into 1996, when the two women joined Extreme Canadian Championship Wrestling, where the two traded the Women's Championship, which McIntyre held for two months. In September, they competed in a strap match—a match where the wrestlers must compete while connected via a leather strap—in which McIntyre was victorious.|$|E

5|$|As the Tsaress {{planned to}} take {{personal}} care of the church, the church has no parish, {{and there is no}} belltower to call the congregation to divine service. But she died before the construction ended, so the church was never cared for by Elizabeth Petrovna. After Elizabeth's death, the Kiev court took no interest maintaining in the church, last consecrated in 1767. Later, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> enough funds to maintain the church, which left the maintaining of the church to private and voluntary funds, such as Andrey Muraviov.|$|E
5|$|At mid-season, WCBS {{announced}} {{that for the}} 2003–04 season it had acquired the broadcast rights to The People's Court after WNBC, which had been airing the revived series since its 1997 debut, dropped it from its lineup. WCBS announced plans to move The People's Court into the time slot that was occupied by Millionaire and the still-airing 4:30 pm local newscast once it joined the station's lineup in September 2003. This led to speculation that the syndicated Millionaire would not be returning for a second season, and BVT's concerns over losing its New York affiliate were {{compounded by the fact}} that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> many time slots available for the show in New York outside of the undesirable late-night slots that syndicators try to avoid.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Syrian superiority {{in numbers}} and equipment, the {{destruction}} of a multitude of armored vehicles and the infantry's failure to infiltrate Degania Alef was the likely cause for the retreat of the main Syrian force to Samakh (Tzemah). A less-organized and sparsely numbered armored and infantry force forked off to attack Degania Bet. Eight tanks, supported by mortar fire, moved within 400 yards of the settlement defense, where they stopped to provide fire support for an infantry attack. The Syrians made two failed attempts to breach the Israeli small arms fire defense and gave up the attempt. Against this force, the Israelis had about 80 people and one PIAT. The defenses in Degania Bet were disorganized and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> enough trenches. They also had no communication link to the command, so Moshe Dayan sent one of his company commanders to assess the situation.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{took place}} in September and October 2004. Although the story is set in 19th century Cardiff, the {{production}} was actually filmed in Swansea and Monmouth, as <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> enough Victorian-looking buildings left in Cardiff. Cardiff's New Theatre {{was used for the}} theatre in which Dickens is telling a story {{at the beginning of the}} episode. An empty Victorian children's home in Penarth was used for Sneed's parlour. Based on research of Victorian morgues, the production team selected red and sepia as the main color scheme.|$|E
5|$|Following the Battle of the Komandorski Islands, Admiral Kinkaid {{requested}} a larger force of 25,000 troops {{to support an}} assault on Kiska. However, as <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> enough ships to transport such a large division to the Aleutians, Kinkaid suggested that the Americans' objective change from Kiska, which was defended by about 9,000 men, to Attu, which was home to only 500 Japanese. On April 1, Kinkaid received approval from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to execute the operation, codenamed SANDCRAB. The terrain of Attu Island was not hospitable for such an operation – much of the island's landmass not covered in snowy peaks was covered in muskeg, a marshy soil type that {{is almost impossible to}} cross by foot. In addition, Attu Island was subject to frequent storms and soupy fogs.|$|E
5|$|General Lee {{responded to}} the British landing with several actions. He began {{reinforcing}} positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston. He also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an avenue of retreat for the fort's garrison, but this failed because <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile (1.6km) channel separating the island from Charleston; the unwillingness of Moultrie and Rutledge to support the effort may also have played a role. The Americans also constructed an entrenchment at {{the northern end of}} Sullivan's Island, which was manned by more than 750 men and three small cannons, and began to fortify a guard post at Haddrell's Point on the mainland opposite Fort Sullivan.|$|E

5|$|In Martinsburg, West Virginia, several {{government}} buildings were evacuated, and multiple citizens reported feeling their homes shaking violently enough to rattle picture frames off the walls. In Charleston, the Kanawha County Courthouse, the West Virginia State Capitol campus, {{and several other}} downtown buildings were evacuated; Kanawha County dispatchers received more than 350 telephone calls in 45 minutes, but <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> any reports of damage to buildings and infrastructure other than minor plaster cracking in the old courthouse. In Philippi, part of a chimney collapsed at the Barbour County courthouse. The West Virginia Office of Miners' Health, Safety and Training stated that West Virginia coal mines were safe following the tremors.

5|$|Mischa Barton, who had met McG on Fastlane, portrayed Marissa Cooper. She {{was cast}} in February 2003. Tate Donovan, who played Jimmy Cooper, {{was cast in}} March 2003. Melinda Clarke guest-starred as Julie Cooper, but read {{for the role of}} Kirsten in her {{audition}} as <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> enough scripted lines for Julie at the time. Rachel Bilson, who was recommended to Schwartz after an unsuccessful audition for Everwood, guest-starred as Summer Roberts, whom the producers had envisaged as a tall Californian blonde. Clarke and Bilson joined as regular cast members later in the season. Chris Carmack, who played Luke Ward, was credited as a guest star for the episode; he joined the regular cast in the next episode.|$|E
5|$|The Act was unusual, {{as it was}} {{obtained}} without Pyott's consent, and created {{a new group of}} commissioners from local justices and dignitaries. They were empowered to set the rates for tolls, and the owner was obliged to transport all goods at the established rates. If <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> sufficient boats and the owner did not provide more, they could license others to provide carriage services. They could also order that locks, wharves and warehouses should be erected. The size of boats was specified, and were to be capable of carrying between 20 and 30 tons of cargo. The tolls set were quite moderate, and a group of merchants appear to have leased the river from Pyott for a period after 1767, but he eventually took control again.|$|E
