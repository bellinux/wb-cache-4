According to López, conservative middle-class whites, convinced by powerful economic interests that minorities are the enemy, supported politicians who promised to curb illegal immigration and crack down on crime but inadvertently also voted for policies that favor the extremely rich, such as slashing taxes for top income brackets, giving corporations more regulatory control over industry and financial markets, union busting, cutting pensions for future public employees, reducing funding for public schools, and retrenching the social welfare state.

50|$|<b>T-bone</b> and porterhouse <b>steaks</b> are {{suited to}} fast, dry heat cooking methods, such as {{grilling}} or broiling. Since they contain {{a small amount}} of collagen relative to other cuts, longer cooking times are not necessary to tenderize the meat. The bone also conducts heat within the meat so that it cooks more evenly and prevents meat drying out and shrinking during cooking. The meat near the bone will cook more slowly {{than the rest of the}} steak, and the tenderloin will tend to reach the desired temperature before the strip.|$|R

Of these groups of cattle, the 308 Select carcasses were followed through the packinghouse and the rib-eye roll and shorthorns were given a bar code number, which contained the EID. This EID allowed for management practices in the previous segments to be accessed through a database. These ribeye rolls and shorthorns were sent to a grocery store in San Antonio, TX and were fabricated and packaged as ribeye <b>steaks,</b> <b>t-bone</b> <b>steaks</b> and porterhouse steaks. Each package had the bar code slumber and a survey attached to the bottom. Approximately 1000 surveys were attached and 165 were returned.

In the household income range, 38 % averaged greater than $ 75, 000 a year and 29 % averaged $ 50, 001 to $ 75, 000.
