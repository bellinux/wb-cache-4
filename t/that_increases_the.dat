5|$|A special but unusual {{consideration}} is cardiogenic shock, where {{the blood pressure}} is decreased not due to dehydration but due to inability of the heart to pump blood through the blood vessels. This situation requires ICU admission, monitoring of the central venous pressure (which requires the insertion of a central venous catheter in a large upper body vein), and the administration of medication <b>that</b> <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> heart pumping action and blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|The {{stability}} of the 6s shell {{is due to the}} presence of a filled 4f shell. An f shell poorly screens the nuclear charge <b>that</b> <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> attractive Coulomb interaction of the 6s shell and the nucleus (see lanthanide contraction). The absence of a filled inner f shell is the reason for the somewhat higher melting temperature of cadmium and zinc, although both these metals still melt easily and, in addition, have unusually low boiling points.|$|E
5|$|Thrombophilia (sometimes {{hypercoagulability}} or a prothrombotic state) is an abnormality {{of blood}} coagulation <b>that</b> <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> risk of thrombosis (blood clots in blood vessels). Such abnormalities {{can be identified}} in 50% {{of people who have}} an episode of thrombosis (such as deep vein thrombosis in the leg) that was not provoked by other causes. A significant proportion of the population has a detectable abnormality, but most of these only develop thrombosis in the presence of an additional risk factor.|$|E

5|$|Electrode {{coatings}} can {{consist of}} a number of different compounds, including rutile, calcium fluoride, cellulose, and iron powder. Rutile electrodes, coated with 25%–45% TiO2, are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create welds with high hydrogen content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking. Electrodes containing calcium fluoride (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen electrodes, are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. Electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking. Finally, iron powder is a common coating additive <b>that</b> <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> rate at which the electrode fills the weld joint, up to twice as fast.|$|E
5|$|While on Müller's trail, {{he happens}} to meet his old friend, the Portuguese {{merchant}} Oliveira da Figueira. With Figueira's help, Tintin enters Müller's house and knocks the criminal unconscious. He finds the prince, who is imprisoned in a dungeon, and rescues him as Haddock arrives with the authorities. Müller is revealed to be the agent of a foreign power responsible for the tampering of the fuel supplies, having invented a type of chemical in tablet form, which {{goes by the name}} Formula 14, <b>that</b> <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> explosive power of oil by a significant amount. Thomson and Thompson find the tablets and swallow them, thinking them to be aspirin, causing them to grow long hair and beards that change colour. After analysing the tablets, Professor Calculus develops an antidote for Thomson and Thompson and a means of countering the affected oil supplies.|$|E

25|$|Unlike a state sales tax, {{which is}} an add-on tax <b>that</b> <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> price of goods and services, this is a {{replacement}} tax.

25|$|Many {{species are}} cryptically colored to {{resemble}} their surroundings. For example, Uroplatus geckos can be almost completely invisible, {{even to a}} nearby observer.
