5|$|Due to misunderstandings {{caused by}} the 2009 {{publication}} of the star's 15% contraction, apparently of its outer atmosphere, Betelgeuse has frequently {{been the subject of}} scare stories and rumors suggesting that it will explode within a year, leading to exaggerated claims about the consequences of such an event. <b>The</b> <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> prevalence of these rumors have been linked to broader misconceptions of astronomy, particularly to doomsday predictions relating to the Mayan calendar. Betelgeuse is not likely to produce a gamma-ray burst and is not close enough for its x-rays, ultraviolet radiation, or ejected material to cause significant effects on Earth.|$|E

The lack of records means that <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> duration of this visit remain uncertain. However, de Lede left in late June, and de Cárdenas {{a few weeks later}} – as relations between Cromwell and the Habsburgs deteriorated – so Wright probably arrived back in Flanders, with any acquisitions he had made, just in time to learn of the Archduke's impending departure – and that of his huge art collection – from Brussels in the autumn of 1655.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1917, the British and French were still searching {{for a way to}} achieve a strategic breakthrough on the Western Front. The previous year had been marked by the costly success of the Anglo-French offensive astride the river Somme, while the French had been unable to take the initiative because of intense German pressure at Verdun until after August 1916. The battles consumed enormous quantities of resources while achieving virtually no strategic gains on the battlefield. The cost to Germany of containing the Anglo-French attacks had been enormous and given that the material preponderance of the Entente and its allies could only be expected to increase in 1917, Hindenburg and Ludendorff decided on a defensive strategy on the Western Front for that year. This impasse reinforced the French and British commanders' belief that to end the stalemate they needed a breakthrough; while this desire may have been the main impetus behind the offensive, <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> location were influenced by political and tactical considerations.|$|E
5|$|Helicoverpa zea is {{the most}} common and {{destructive}} pest of soybean growth in Virginia. About one-third of Virginia acreage is treated annually with pounds of insecticide, costing farmers around 2 million dollars. The degree of damage varies {{on the size of the}} pest infestation, <b>the</b> <b>timing,</b> <b>and</b> the stage of the plant. However, soybean plants are capable of withstanding a large amount of damage without substantial yield loss depending on soil moisture, planting date, and weather. If the damage is early in the plants life, then damage will mostly be to the leaves. Plants compensate for the damage by processes such as increasing seed size in remaining pods. Most damage happens in August, when the plants are flowering. Attacks that happen after August do much less damage because many pods have developed tougher walls that H. zea can't penetrate. Infestations that affect pod formation and seed filling have the potential to reduce yields, and because this happens in the later stages of plants, they have less time to compensate.|$|E
5|$|It {{quickly became}} {{evident that the}} {{cyclical}} pattern of the monsoon weather would dictate <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> pace of military operations in the northeast. From November through May (the dry season), North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces advanced out of Sam Neua Province along Route 6 {{and out of the}} Barthelemy Pass through Ban Ban toward the Plain of Jars. The lack of roads and the primitive state of those that did exist forced the communists to stretch their lines of communication taut, inviting counterattack. This Vang Pao's forces did from June through October (the wet season), utilizing air power, air mobility, and guerrilla tactics to push the communists back to their starting places.|$|E

5|$|Most European {{countries}} have {{taken steps to}} conserve the corn crake and produce national management policies; {{there is also an}} overall European action plan. The focus of conservation effort is to monitor populations and ecology and to improve survival, principally through changing <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> method of hay harvesting. Later cutting gives time for breeding to be completed, and leaving uncut strips at the edges of fields and cutting from the centre outwards reduces the casualties from mowing. Implementing these changes is predicted to stop the population decline if the measures are applied on a sufficiently large scale. Reduction of illegal hunting, and protection in countries where hunting is still allowed, are also conservation aims. Reintroduction of the corn crake is being attempted in England, and breeding sites are scheduled for protection in many other countries. Where breeding sites impinge on urban areas, there are cost implications, estimated in one German study at several million euros per corn crake. The corn crake {{does not appear to be}} seriously threatened on its wintering grounds and may benefit from deforestation, which creates more open habitats.|$|E
5|$|The Storm Prediction Center(SPC) {{began to}} note the {{possibility}} that a severe weather event could develop on December30 as early as December25, 2010. Nonetheless, the predictability of the event was too low as the event was several days out. As the anticipated event grew closer, confidence in the forecast slowly increased, though uncertainties in <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> extent of the tornado outbreak still existed. These uncertainties remained through December29 with forecasts calling for only marginal hail and possibly damaging gusts. However, the SPC indicated that supercells and more severe weather could result from atmospheric conditions deviating slightly from the forecast. In contrast, forecasts were more confident in a widespread outbreak of severe weather for New Year's Eve; the SPC issued a slight risk outlook for much of the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Ozarks as a result.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} {{team had}} access to Codemasters' full audio library, which was composed of sound assets dating from the first Colin McRae Rally (1998) up to Grid 2 (2013). On a case-by-case basis, they decided whether to reuse existing sounds or update them. The result {{was a combination of}} audio from various games; suspensions sounds were taken from Dirt 3, wind, gearbox and mechanical samples from Colin McRae Rally 2005, garage sounds from , and music from Colin McRae Rally 04. One aspect of the audio that was kept intact was the original pacenotes read by professional co-driver Nicky Grist. The team did not want to disrupt <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> delivery of critical track information so they opted to use the original recordings in this case.

5|$|In 269, while Claudius Gothicus (Gallienus' successor) was {{defending}} {{the borders of}} Italy and the Balkans against Germanic invasions, Zenobia was cementing her authority; Roman officials in the East were caught between loyalty to the emperor and Zenobia's increasing demands for allegiance. <b>The</b> <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> rationale of the queen's decision {{to use military force}} to strengthen her authority in the East is unclear; scholar Gary K. Young suggested that Roman officials refused to recognize Palmyrene authority, and Zenobia's expeditions were intended to maintain Palmyrene dominance. Another factor may have been the weakness of Roman central authority and its corresponding inability to protect the provinces, which probably convinced Zenobia {{that the only way to}} maintain stability in the East was to control the region directly. Historian Jacques Schwartz tied Zenobia's actions to her desire to protect Palmyra's economic interests, which were threatened by Rome's failure to protect the provinces. Also, according to Schwartz, the economic interests conflicted; Bostra and Egypt received trade which would have otherwise passed through Palmyra. The Tanukhids near Bostra and the merchants of Alexandria probably attempted to rid themselves of Palmyrene domination, triggering a military response from Zenobia.|$|E

30|$|Worthy of note is {{the fact}} that <b>the</b> <b>timings</b> <b>and</b> nature of {{frequency}} changes of the ~ 2 Myr cycle are different between the chert bed thickness time series and the orbital solutions of Laskar et al. (2004, 2011 a), although La 2010 d and chert bed thickness time series are similar in the ~ 1.6 Myr cycle at 200 Ma (Fig. 4). Additionally, the ~ 2 Myr cycle detected in the S-transform spectra of the chert bed thickness time series shows the amplitude modulation with ~ 4 Myr and ~ 8 Myr periodicities, which is different from the orbital solutions in which the ~ 2 Myr eccentricity cycle shows the amplitude modulation with ~ 5 to 10 Myr periodicity (Fig. 4). As described by Laskar et al. (2004, 2011 a, b), their orbital solutions before Neogene have large degree of uncertainty due to the chaotic behavior of Earth-Mars secular resonance. <b>The</b> <b>timings</b> <b>and</b> nature of frequency transition of the ~ 2 Myr cycle detected in the geological record should have potential to constrain the “chaotic” evolution of the Solar system by adjusting <b>the</b> <b>timings</b> <b>and</b> nature of frequency modulation of the ~ 2 Myr eccentricity cycle in the orbital solutions to those of our geologic record.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{navigation}} accuracy of the X-ray pulsar navigation system, {{in this paper we}} propose a constant fraction timing method based on the low-pass filter to measure the arrival time of the X-ray pulse in X-ray pulsar navigation. According to the technical scheme, <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> accuracies <b>and</b> dead times of original peaking <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> improved constant fraction timing are measured. Experimental results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> accuracy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dead time of <b>the</b> peaking <b>timing</b> system are 18 ns <b>and</b> 4750 ns, <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> accuracy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dead time of <b>the</b> constant fraction <b>timing</b> system are 0. 78 ns <b>and</b> 105 ns. <b>The</b> <b>timing</b> accuracy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dead time of constant fraction timing system are significantly improved compared with those of <b>the</b> peaking <b>timing</b> system.
