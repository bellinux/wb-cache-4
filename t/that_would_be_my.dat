Live and Let Die is also {{the first of two}} films featuring David Hedison as Felix Leiter, who reprised the role in Licence to Kill.

Hedison {{did not expect to}} return to the role, saying [...] "I was sure <b>that...</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> first – and last" [...] and Glen was reluctant to cast the 61-year-old actor, since the role even had a scene parachuting. Hedison was the only actor to play Leiter twice until Jeffrey Wright appeared in both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace.|$|E
500|$|Perry is a LGBT rights activist. She {{supported}} Stonewall {{during their}} [...] "It gets better..... today" [...] campaign to prevent homophobic bullying, and dedicated the music video to her song [...] "Firework" [...] to the It Gets Better Project. Perry told Do Something in November 2008 {{she was proud}} to be a gay activist, saying [...] "I've always been a very open-minded person, but I definitely believe in equality." [...] She confirmed that she voted against Proposition 8, an amendment (ultimately ruled unconstitutional) that legally defined marriage as a union solely {{between a man and a}} woman in California. In June 2012, Perry expressed her hopes for LGBT equality, commenting [...] "hopefully, we will look back at this moment and think like we do now concerning [...] civil rights issues. We'll just shake our heads in disbelief, saying, 'Thank God we've evolved.' <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> prayer for the future." [...] In December 2012, Perry was awarded the Trevor Hero Award by The Trevor Project for her work and activism on behalf of LGBT youth. On March 18, 2017, she received a Nation Equality Award from Human Rights Campaign for [...] "using her powerful voice and international platform to speak out for LGBTQ equality", with the organization further stating that [...] "Katy's message of inclusion and equality continues to inspire us and the world".|$|E

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, {{a change}} {{occurred}} in Susan's personality. During the surrogacy storyline, viewers saw Susan become the [...] "mother-in-law from hell". Woodbune {{said that it was}} challenging trying to change the character of Susan. During clashes with her son-in-law Daniel Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker), Susan was seen becoming controlling and bossy. Woodburne said [...] "As the story progressed it became apparent {{that we were going to}} have to go to the extremes of the less attractive qualities of our characters. We talked about it and decided to go for it – he would be the overbearing husband and Susan the mother-in-law from hell". Woodburne added that Susan is acting out of love for her daughter and for Libby's desire to have a child. In July 2011, Woodburne told a writer for Channel 5 that she still found the role of Susan challenging. She explained that she likes Susan because she adapts well and takes all the things that happen to her in her stride. Woodburne said Karl and Susan are now less naive and exuberant due to the things they have gone through. When asked what the future holds for her character, Woodburne stated [...] "You know, I'm kind of with Susan. I like the Kennedy house when it's full of noisy kids, being naughty and creating havoc. I like it loud and messy. So <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> hope, that we get a bit of that happening again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing like as {{dangerous}} as being in the Infantry," [...] he answered. [...] "And <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> only other alternative.

6000|$|... "Afraid of myself!" [...] she said, getting up. She {{stood there}} {{a moment and then}} added: [...] "If I <b>were</b> afraid of <b>my</b> husband <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> simply <b>my</b> duty. <b>That's</b> what women are {{expected}} to be." ...|$|R

We want to kill for ever the misunderstandings between the two greatest nations in the world. My creed of life could be yours, too, without a single lapse from your patriotism. Friendship, alliance, brotherhood, between Germany and America. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> text." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{sat up in}} the {{freshness}} of the morning, trying to remember how I had got there, and why I had such {{a profound sense of}} desertion and despair. Then things came clear in my mind. With the plain, reasonable daylight, I could look my circumstances fairly in the face. I saw the wild folly of my frenzy overnight, and I could reason with myself. [...] "Suppose the worst?" [...] I said. [...] "Suppose the machine altogether lost--perhaps destroyed? It behoves me to be calm and patient, to learn the way of the people, to get a clear idea of the method of my loss, and the means of getting materials and tools; so that in the end, perhaps, I may make another." [...] <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> only hope, perhaps, but better than despair. And, after all, it was a beautiful and curious world.|$|E

Seeing me grow no older, they thought I was a wizard, and I was obliged to seek a new habitation. Ever since, my fate has been the necessity of moving from place to place. I would go somewhere as a man beginning to show signs of age, and I would remain as long as a man could reasonably be supposed to live without becoming truly old and decrepit. Sometimes I remained in a place far longer than my prudence should have permitted, and many were the perils I escaped on account of this rashness; but I have gradually learned wisdom." ...|$|E
60|$|The third {{dream was}} the most {{interesting}} and personal. Some one came to me {{to ask me to}} help in the deliverance of a company of Italian prisoners who were to be ransomed for money. I said I had no money. They answered, Yes, I had some that belonged to me as a brother of St. Francis, if I would give it up. I said I did not know even that I was a brother of St. Francis; but I thought to myself, that perhaps the Franciscans of Fésole, whom I had helped to make hay in their field in 1845, had adopted me for one; only I didn't see how the consequence of <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> having any money. However, I said they were welcome to whatever I had; and then I heard the voice of an Italian woman singing; and I have never heard such divine singing before nor since;--the sounds absolutely strong and real, and the melody altogether lovely. If I could have written it! But I could not even remember it when I woke,--only how beautiful it was.|$|E

60|$|At {{last the}} day arrived {{on which the}} steamer was to sail, and the {{generally}} cool Walkirk actually grew nervous {{in his efforts to}} get me ready to start by the early morning train for the city. In these efforts I did not assist him in the least. In fact had he not been with me I think that I should not have tried to leave home in time to catch the steamer. The more I thought of catching the steamer, the less I cared to do so; the more I thought of leaving home, the less I cared to do so. It was not that I was going away from Sylvia that made me thus reluctant to start. It was because I was going away without taking leave of her,--without a word or even a sign from her. I ground my teeth as I thought of how I had lost the only chance I had had of bidding her farewell, and of assuring her that, no matter what happened, I would be constant to her and to the principles in which we had both come to believe. I had been too much excited on the morning I had left her in the Frenchman's cottage to think that <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> last chance of seeing her; that thereafter Mother Anastasia would never cease to guard her from my speech or sight. I should have rushed in, caring for nothing. People might have talked, but Sylvia would have known that prohibitions and separations would make no difference in my feeling for her.|$|E

with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner

married to him in 3 years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt

perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly 20 years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young still about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse

the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure 18 carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the
