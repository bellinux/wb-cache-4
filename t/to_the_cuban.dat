5|$|Ongoing {{negotiations}} through March yielded {{an agreement}} on March 7, 1999, {{over the objections of}} the State Department. The proceeds of the series were a major sticking point in negotiations, as it violated the United States embargo against Cuba. Instead of going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> Government, it was agreed that proceeds would fund baseball programs in Cuba.|$|E
5|$|Betances also {{promoted}} {{direct intervention}} of Puerto Ricans in the Cuban independence struggle, which eventually {{happened in the}} Cuban War of Independence (1895–98). Spain had promoted political reform in Puerto Rico, and the local political climate was not conducive to a second revolution at the time. Therefore, Betances and the Puerto Rican revolutionaries ceded their caches of firearms hidden in Saint Thomas, Curaçao and Haiti <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> rebels in October 1871, since their struggle was deemed as a priority.|$|E
50|$|The call-up {{was said}} to be around 140,000 men, and it was hoped the {{announcement}} would send a message <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cubans</b> <b>to</b> end their advance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> SWA/Namibian border.|$|R

50|$|For {{almost a}} month, {{negotiations}} revolved around Cuba. <b>The</b> Teller Amendment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Declaration of War with Spain made it impractical for <b>the</b> U.S. <b>to</b> annex <b>the</b> island {{as it did}} with Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. On first instance, Spain refused <b>to</b> accept <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> national debt of four hundred million dollars, but ultimately it had no choice. Eventually, {{it was agreed that}} Cuba was to be granted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cubans</b> and <b>the</b> four hundred million dollar liability returned to Spain. It was also agreed that Spain would cede Guam and Puerto Rico <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States.|$|R
5|$|Both Sherman and McKinley {{sought a}} {{peaceful}} resolution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> War, preferably involving an independent Cuba without American intervention. The United States and Spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897, but {{it became clear that}} Spain would never concede Cuban independence, while the rebels (and their American supporters) would never settle for anything less. In January 1898, Spain promised some concessions to the rebels, but when American consul Fitzhugh Lee reported riots in Havana, McKinley agreed to send the battleship USS Maine there to protect American lives and property. On February 15, the Maine exploded and sank with 266 men killed.|$|E

5|$|Immediately after {{returning}} to Paris, Betances became a key contact for the Cuban insurgency in Paris. He made several fund raising efforts, including one that attempted to fund quinine shipments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> rebels, to ease their pain when infected by malaria in the island battlefields. These efforts outlasted the Pact of Zanjón, which ended the Ten Years' War in 1878. Betances also used his diplomatic contacts to guarantee humane treatment (and eventually freedom from imprisonment) to José Maceo, the brother of Antonio Maceo, the later military leader of the Cuban War of Independence, when both Antonio and José were arrested by the Spanish government in 1882. The Maceo brothers both escaped imprisonment, were recaptured in Gibraltar and {{turned over to the}} Spanish authorities, but José remained in jail long after Antonio regained his liberty and fled to New York City. Betances even used Lord Gladstone as a mediator, and attempted to convince him of having Jamaica (where his family had properties) join an Antillean Federation.|$|E

50|$|In February 1963, de Vosjoli {{forwarded}} {{a lengthy}} report {{from one of}} his Cuban contacts containing details of Soviet forces in Cuba.

5|$|Noriega began {{supplying}} {{weapons to}} the M-19 rebel group in Colombia in 1981. On one occasion, the PDF supplied weapons to {{a small band of}} M-19 fighters who flew to Panama from Cuba, before an attack on Colombia's west coast. According to some reports, the M-19 also asked Noriega to mediate their negotiations with Columbian drug cartels in February 1982. A 1990 book discussing Noriega's administration stated that he had sold 5000 Panamanian passports <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> government for use by its intelligence services. Noriega's direct involvement in moving weapons and drugs declined in the early 1980s; instead, he invested in legal businesses, and used these as a cover for money laundering operations, much of which were related to the drug trade. The U.S. intelligence service believed Noriega to have amassed a personal fortune in European banks {{as a result of his}} illegal activities, as well as owning two homes in Panama and one in France.|$|E

The Cuban Red Cross mobilized about 8,700 volunteers to assist victims of the storm in the 900 shelters set up throughout the island. Plastic sheeting was to be distributed {{for about a week}} for residents to patch holes in the roof of their homes. The National Council of Churches sent relief goods valued at $70,000 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> Government on October9. By February 1999, the Cuban Red Cross distributed over 30,000 sheets of roofing to nearly 5,500 people in three provinces. Several months after the storm, the Cuban Government reported that they had allocated about $38million in funds for Hurricane Georges.|$|E
5|$|The {{concert was}} planned {{for several months}} prior to its public {{announcement}} while the band was on their 2016 tour of South America, titled América Latina Olé Tour 2016. The bands' manager, Joyce Smyth, and Concerts Westworked extensively with the Cuban government {{in order for the}} show to be approved, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> government still having control over what its citizens listen to. The embargo on Cuba proved to be a technical challenge for the band and stage crews since they had to ship all of their equipment from Belgium and could not rely on local infrastructure to assist to the degree that they are used to in more developed areas.|$|E
