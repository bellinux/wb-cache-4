The girder carried an upper track beam and a lower track beam, upon the sides of each of which the rails, four in number, were placed. The two bearing rails, which carried the load of the train, consisted of angle irons placed upon the outer upper edge of wooden stringers upon the lower track beam. These stringers {{were placed in the}} exterior recesses formed by two channel bars properly secured to the sides of the posts. These rails were fastened to each other, to the stringers, and to the track beam by bolts passing clear through. Two vertically placed rails for the balancing or friction wheels were carried by the upper track beam. The distance from out to out between the lower rails was 22½ inches, this being sufficient to insure the necessary <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffness.</b> This was the gauge of the road. The distance between the upper rails was 17½ inches. It was expected to adopt the common form of rail, beveling the edges of the lower stringers and placing the rail at an angle of about 45 degrees. The rails were {{in the form of a}} right angle, and the treads of the wheels were made with a corresponding right angle groove. The usual length of post, 24 feet, would give a clear headway of 14 feet, 4 feet being taken up by the truss and 6 feet forming the foundation.|$|E
40|$|We present {{variable}} negative stiffness actuation (VnSA), {{an alternative}} method of achieving variable stiffness actuation {{based on the}} nonlinear deflection characteristics of buckling beams. The approach exploits <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffness</b> variations of axially loaded beams around their critical buckling load to achieve an actuator with adjustable stiffness. In particular, <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffness</b> of buckled beams are positive under tensile loading and for compressive loading below their first critical buckling load, while they display negative stiffness above this critical value. Furthermore, for small deflections <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffness</b> of buckled beams depends linearly {{on the amount of}} axial loading. Consequently, the stiffness of a variable stiffness actuator can be modulated (i) by decreasing the <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffness</b> through an increase of the axial compressive loading on a beam, up to values above the first critical buckling load where the overall stiffness of the actuator approaches its lowest negative value, and (ii) by increasing the <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffness</b> through application of tensile axial loading. Capitalizing on the concept of negative stiffness, the lowest stiffness of VnSA can be set arbitrarily close to zero or even to negative values (when counterbalanced), while very high stiffness values are also achievable by tensile loading of the beam. As a result, VnSA can modulate its stiffness over a uniquely large range that includes zero and negative stiffness values. Furthermore, thanks to the negative stiffness characteristics, the stiffness of VnSA can be kept very low without sacrificing the mechanical integrity and load bearing capacity of the actuator. We introduce the design of VnSA, theoretically analyze its stiffness modulation response, and provide implementation details of a prototype. We also provide experimental results detailing range of stiffness modulation and force tracking performance achieved with this prototype and discuss its correspondence with the- theory...|$|E

To support this claim, a two-dimensional FEM analysis was performed for a transverse representative volume element. Specifically, the effect of fiber/matrix displacement compatibility at the interface was studied under both tensile and compressive transverse loadings.

The analyses show that the transverse tensile strength and stiffness are best predicted when a debonded interface is assumed for the composite.

Materials of this article should be relevant and will make it possible to calculate the strength of railway track using the correct and corrected performance of horizontal <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffness</b> of rail threads. Methodology. Determination of horizontal transverse rigidity of rail yarns with different designs of rail fasteners was conducted by measuring the quantities of transverse displacement of rails calculation points – namely the head and sole. For research the specialist equipment was created, made up of lineside jack DC- 20, equipped with a hydraulic pressure gauge to measure pressure and rigid rod for horizontal rail stop in the thread, the opposite of the jack. Lateral movement of the head and sole of the track were recorded, and measured with indicators of clock type within a few hundredths of a millimeter. The horizontal lateral load on the rail jack was created by the injection pressure in the cylinder which was fixed with manometer into the jack. Load of rails was conducted over 2 tons of degrees ranging from 0 to 8 tons. To obtain reliable measurement results of lateral movement of the head and the base rails, its movement was conducted for each type fasteners not less than in 3 sections. Measurements were carried out without the creation of vertical load. Findings. With the developed method was found transverse displacement magnitude of rails calculation points at different designs of rail fasteners. Originality.

Density functional theory calculations suggest that upon compression, the two-layer graphene film transforms into a diamond-like film, producing both elastic deformations and sp 2 -to-sp 3 chemical changes. Experiments and calculations show that this reversible phase change is not observed for a single buffer layer on SiC or graphene films thicker than 3 to 5 layers.

Slamming occurs when the flexible rollers on the skip which normally act on the guides are inoperative. The primary concern is that this slamming event can give rise to large lateral loads on the shaft steelwork and is therefore a factor which limits the speed at which the skip can be drawn up the shaft. This study extends previous work to investigate the influence of compressive forces in the guides on the response of the skip and the steelwork.

Each beam was tested in symmetric four-point bending about its major and minor-axis and deflections, rotations and surface strains were recorded. Beam <b>transverse</b> <b>stiffnesses,</b> support rotations and splice rotational stiffnesses were quantified and compared with theoretical predictions. Predicted deflections were 3. 5 % to 18. 5 % larger and support rotations were 10 % smaller to 14. 2 % larger than the experimental values. Splice end rotations were generally poorly predicted...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the bolt pull-through stiffness and strength of pultruded glass-fibre-reinforced polymer (GFRP) plate is described. Details of an adjustable bolt pull-through test rig are presented. The rig was used to carry out 80 low and ultimate load tests on single bolts loaded in tension at the centres of square pultruded GFRP plates. In the tests, one plate thickness, two bolt diameters, four plate side lengths, two sets of plate edge conditions and two orientations of the principal orthotropic axes with respect {{to one of the}} edge conditions were investigated. <b>Transverse</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> as well as damage and ultimate tensile loads of the bolt-plate specimens were quantified from the test data. The latter are presented graphically to illustrate the effects of bolt diameter, plate slenderness, plate edge conditions, etc. on stiffnesses and damage/ultimate loads. Failure modes are also described and illustrated...|$|R
