5|$|A {{few of the}} {{closely related}} mites also infest humans, some causing intense itching by their bites and others by {{burrowing}} into the skin. Species that normally infest other animals such as rodents may infest humans if <b>their</b> <b>normal</b> hosts are eliminated. Three species of mite are a threat to honey bees and one of these, Varroa destructor, has become the largest single problem faced by beekeepers worldwide. Mites cause several forms of allergic diseases, including hay fever, asthma and eczema, and they aggravate atopic dermatitis. Mites are also significant crop pests, although predatory mites {{may be useful in}} controlling some of these.|$|E
5|$|A {{major change}} {{was made in}} the way overfulfillment was rewarded. Progressive piece-rates, where rates {{increased}} as outputs grew, were ended, and workers were paid a one-off bonus upon overachieving a quota. Where bonus rates were retained for each percentage of overfulfillment, they were capped. For example, in engineering, bonuses could not exceed 20 percent of <b>their</b> <b>normal</b> earnings.|$|E
40|$|Medical {{illustrations}} use simple drawing {{styles to}} demonstrate shapes and features of organs and organ systems, while omitting irrelevant details. In this contribution, {{we present a}} non-photorealistic rendering algorithm for illustrating anatomical data. Unlike other existing methods that rely on available triangulations of the organs to be rendered, our approach relies only on a subset of surface points, together with <b>their</b> <b>normals.</b> The advantage is that surface points and normals can be quite easily extracted from medical data, without an intermediate triangulation. ...|$|R

5|$|Adventurer : This {{advancement}} badge {{introduces the}} Scout to basic pioneering, including whipping, basic lashing, and other advanced knots. The Scout {{is required to}} know more advanced forms of first aid (treatment of shock, sprains, and fainting). The Scout needs to help plan, and be second {{in charge of a}} patrol hike. Other requirements for the badge include knowledge of HIV/AIDS and knowledge of how a Court of Honour functions.

5|$|After {{problems}} with the first two airborne operations in Sicily, the Royal Air Force advisor assigned to the 1st Airborne Division suggested that the American C-47 pilots adopt the Royal Air Force bomber stream formation. This entailed the aircraft flying in pairs one behind the other with one minute between each aircraft, instead of flying in <b>their</b> <b>normal</b> 'V' formation. The suggestion was dismissed by the American pilots, who were mostly pre-war airline pilots, not least because their training had not included any instruction in night time navigation and the inexperienced crews relied heavily on following the aircraft in front.|$|E
5|$|Although the Grand Fleet {{made several}} sorties {{over the next}} few years it is not known if Agincourt participated in them. On 23April 1918, Agincourt and Hercules were {{stationed}} at Scapa Flow to provide cover for the Scandinavian convoys between Norway and Britain when the High Seas Fleet sortied in an attempt to destroy the convoy. The reports from German Intelligence were slightly off schedule, as both the inbound and outbound convoys were in port when the Germans reached <b>their</b> <b>normal</b> route so Admiral Scheer ordered the fleet to return to Germany without spotting any British ships.|$|E

For both 2 D lattice types, the 3 rd and 4 th symbols in a full (and short) Hermann–Mauguin plane symmetry group symbol refer to symmetries along the x-axis and the 〈 11 ̅〉 directions.

5|$|Between 06:00 and 12:00 UTC on September10, the United States Weather Bureau issued storm signals, {{equivalent}} to a tropical storm warning in , from Cedar Key, Florida, to Charleston, South Carolina. These were later upgraded to hurricane warnings in South Florida. Due to inclement weather conditions in West Palm Beach, which had been newly incorporated as a town just days earlier, businesses suspended <b>their</b> <b>normal</b> operations and people boarded up buildings, even as the strongest winds arrived. As the cyclone moved into the Gulf of Mexico, reports from September 12 through September 14 helped ships prepare for the storm.|$|E

The curvature presents {{no local}} obstruction to equally spaced columns in contrast to curved crystals for which the crystalline bonds are frustrated. Instead, the vanishing compressional strain of the columns implies that <b>their</b> <b>normals</b> lie on geodesics which converge (diverge) in regions of positive (negative) Gaussian curvature, in analogy to the focussing of light rays by a lens. We show that the out of plane bending of the cylinders acts as an effective ordering field. Comment: 4 pages, RevTeX, 2 included figure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With {{any given}} convex body we {{associate}} three numbers that exhibit, respectively, its deviation from a ball, a centrally symmetric body, {{and a body}} of constant width. Several properties of these deviation measures are studied. Then, noting that these special bodies may be {{defined in terms of}} <b>their</b> <b>normals,</b> corresponding deviation measures for normals are introduced. Several inequalities are proved that show that convex bodies cannot deviate much from these special types if their corresponding deviations of the normals are small. These inequalities can be interpreted as stability results. 1...|$|R

In safe-hold mode, the Small Spacecraft Technology Initiative (SSTI) Clark spacecraft must keep its solar arrays towards the Sun using only CSS cells to sense the Sun.

Three battalions of paratroopers were brought in to patrol the airfield's perimeter.|$|E
5|$|Males attract mates by {{constructing}} specially-shaped tunnels {{in which}} they sing.

Females lay their eggs either in <b>their</b> <b>normal</b> burrows or in specially-dug brood chambers which are sealed when complete in the case of the genus Neoscapteriscus or not sealed in the case of genera Gryllotalpa and Neocurtilla.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the shear flow of well-aligned one-component smectic phases, such as thermotropic smectics and lamellar diblock copolymers, below the critical region. We show that, {{as a result}} of thermal fluctuations of the layers, parallel (c) alignment is generically unstable and perpendicular (a) alignment is stable against long-wavelength undulations. We also find, surprisingly, that both a and c are stable for a narrow window of values for the anisotropic viscosity. PACS numbers: 61. 30. Gd, 83. 70 Jr, 83. 70. Hq, 47. 20. Hw Typeset using REVTEX 1 In the presence of simple shear flow, smectic phases exhibit a surprising degree of complexity. As shear rate and temperature are changed, a variety of transitions in orientation and morphology have been observed. Although one might expect the liquid layers to simply slide over each other with <b>their</b> <b>normals</b> parallel to the shear gradient, the c orientation (Fig. 1), they often orient with <b>their</b> layer <b>normals</b> pointing in the vorticity (or neutral) direction...|$|R

40|$|A new {{algorithm}} is proposed which uses the Hough Transform to recognize two dimensional objects independent of their orientations, sizes and locations.

Features of the straight lines, namely the lengths and the angles of <b>their</b> <b>normals,</b> <b>their</b> lengths and the end point positions are extracted using the Hough Transform. A data structure for the extracted lines is constructed so that it is efficient to match the features of the lines of one object to those of another object, and determine if one object is a rotated and/or scaled version of the other. Finally a generalized Hough Transform is used to match the end points of the two sets of lines. The simulation experiments show good results for objects with significant linear features...|$|R
5|$|Obesity is most {{commonly}} {{caused by a}} combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility.

5|$|Over time, as Rome's empire grew, the two annual consuls {{ceased to}} be enough to command its many armies in the field or {{administer}} its many provinces.

Over time, however, with increasing need for competent generals and administrators, prorogation of magistrates became the norm; and the device was used, increasingly by the assemblies, to grant imperium to popular politicians.|$|E
