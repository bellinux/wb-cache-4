40|$|Vibtation {{characteristics}} of agricultural rubber crawler vehicle {{vary depending on}} the center of gravity, mass, moment of inertia, location arrangement of <b>track</b> <b>rollers</b> and dynamic spring constant and viscous damping coeffecient of a rubber crawler and so on. Especially, location arrangement of <b>track</b> <b>rollers</b> and center of gravity are impotrant design factors in order to reduce machine vibration. Inthis study, analytical simulation based in the dynamic 3 -D model of rubber crawler vehicle driving in solid horizonal surface was performed in oeder to asess the effects of arrangement of <b>track</b> <b>rollers</b> and the center of gravity on vibration {{characteristics of}} rubber crawler vehicle. As a result, it was certified that vibration characteristics of rubber crawler vehicle were significantly influenced by arrangement of <b>track</b> <b>rollers</b> and the center of gravity. Especially, as center of gravity deviates from center of crawler 2 ̆ 7 s ground contact length to forward or backward, machine vibration increased and this tendency was remarkably in the arrangement of four <b>track</b> <b>rollers</b> compared with five <b>track</b> <b>rollers.</b> Therefore, it is necessary to consider the vibration characteristics of rubber crawler vehicle due to deviating of center of gravity at designing of location arrangement of <b>track</b> <b>rollers...</b>|$|R
