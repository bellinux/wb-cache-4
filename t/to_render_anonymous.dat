40|$|To {{carry out}} the {{epidemiological}} study of patients suffering from a given cancer, the Department of Medical Informatics (DIM) has to link information coming from different hospitals and medical laboratories in the Burgundy region. Demands from the French department for computerized information security (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des LibertÃ©s: CNIL), in regard to abiding by the law of January 6, 1978, completed by the law of July 1 st, 1994 on nominal data processing {{in the framework of}} medical research have to be taken into account. Notably, the CNIL advised <b>to</b> <b>render</b> <b>anonymous</b> patient identities before the extraction of each establishment file. This paper describes a recently implemented protocol, registered with the French department for computerized information security (Service Central de la SÃ©curitÃ© des SystÃ¨mes d'information : SCSSI) whose purpose is <b>to</b> <b>render</b> <b>anonymous</b> medical files in view of their extraction. Once rendered anonymous, these files will be exportable so as to be merged with other files and used in a framework of epidemiological studies. Therefore, this protocol uses the Standard Hash Algorithm (SHA) which allows the replacement of identities by their imprints while ensuring a minimal collision rate in order to allow a correct linkage of the different information concerning the same patient. A first evaluation of the extraction and anonymity software with regard to the purpose of an epidemiological survey is described here. In this paper, we also show how {{it would be possible to}} implement this system by means of the Internet communication network...|$|E

5000|$|Whereas in The Creation Swieten {{was able}} to limit himself <b>to</b> <b>rendering</b> an {{existing}} (<b>anonymous)</b> libretto into German, for The Seasons he had a much more demanding task. Olleson writes, [...] "Even when Thomson's images were retained, they required abbreviation and adaptation {{to such an extent}} that usually no more than faint echoes of them can be discerned, and the libretto often loses all touch with the poem which was its starting point. Increasingly during the course of the oratorio, the words are essentially van Swieten's own or even imported from foreign sources." ...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decade, the „everyday(ness) “ {{has begun to}} occupy the {{attention}} of numerous writers and scholars in humanities as a „site of all possible signification“ (Blanchot), where tragic and sublime become visible (Gospodinov). Aleksandar Hemon, American writer of Bosnian origin, thanks to his double perspective of immigrant author, manages <b>to</b> <b>render</b> visible the <b>anonymous</b> everydayness, which usually remains outside of our automatic perception. The aim {{of this paper is}} to explain how Aleksandar Hemon, by using the double perspective, complex form and various postmodernist games, manages to bring closer the American capitalistic everydayness to the readers in former Yugoslav states, and simultaneously, how he manages to present the life in socialism to the readers in USA and in the other capitalist countries. Thanks to irony and innovative language, each of these „everydaynesses“ becomes visible also to those who actually lived it without noting its ridiculous, scary and absurd aspects...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} Burgundy {{perinatal}} network (18 obstetrical units; 18 [*] 500 births per year), discharge abstracts and additional {{data were collected}} for all mothers and newborns. In accordance with French law, data were <b>rendered</b> <b>anonymous</b> before statistical analysis, and were linked to patients using a specific procedure. This procedure allowed data concerning each mother {{to be linked to}} those for her newborn(s). This study showed that all mothers and newborns were included in the regional database; the data for all mothers were linked to those for their infant(s) in all cases. Additional data (gestational age) were obtained for 99. 9 % of newborns...|$|R
2500|$|Pursuing his {{interest}} in Schopenhauer's work, Pogor discovered the Buddhist worldview. By the early 1880s, his study of Buddhist concepts had become more systematic: he read the scholarly works of Eugène Burnouf, then popularized Buddhist principles in a Convorbiri Literare series (1883–1884). With Maiorescu, and using German intermediaries, Pogor helped Romanians become acquainted with Classical Chinese poetry. While Maiorescu gave his touch <b>to</b> Zhuangzi, Pogor <b>rendered</b> an <b>anonymous</b> (and possibly irretrievable) piece, called [...] "Lover Submitting". In tandem, he looked into Sanskrit literature, translating translations from Amaru.|$|R

30|$|The {{design of}} the survey {{questions}} and data collection strategy were carefully developed {{in order to ensure}} that our sample is representative of all migrants, including illegal and non-registered migrants. The randomized procedure for selecting addresses within an EA was useful in capturing a representative selection of migrants, including those that were not registered in official data. The legal status of respondents was not asked for and this was made clear to the respondents before the survey was administered. In addition, it was made clear to respondents that the data would be <b>rendered</b> <b>anonymous</b> and not used for any purpose other than academic research. In order to maximize trust, interviewers were chosen from a broad range of backgrounds and received detailed classroom and in-the-field training, followed up by randomized quality checks.|$|R
40|$|Analyses of individuals' genomes - {{their entire}} DNA {{sequence}} - have increased {{knowledge about the}} links between genetics and disease. Anticipated advances in 'next generation' DNA-sequencing techniques will see the routine research use of whole genomes, rather than distinct parts, {{within the next few}} years. The scientific benefits of genomic research are, however, accompanied by legal and ethical concerns. Despite the assumption that genetic research data can and will be <b>rendered</b> <b>anonymous,</b> participants' identities can sometimes be elucidated, which could cause data protection legislation to apply. We undertake a timely reappraisal of these laws - particularly new penalties - and identifiability in genomic research.

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of mobile web browsing, the energy consumed by a phone browser while surfing the web is poorly understood. We present an infrastructure for measuring the precise energy used by a mobile browser <b>to</b> <b>render</b> web pages. We then measure the energy needed <b>to</b> <b>render</b> financial, e-commerce, email, blogging, news and social networking sites. Our tools are sufficiently precise to measure the energy needed <b>to</b> <b>render</b> individual web elements, such as cascade style sheets (CSS), Javascript, images, and plug-in objects. Our results show that for popular sites, downloading and parsing cascade style sheets and Javascript consumes a significant fraction of the total energy needed <b>to</b> <b>render</b> the page. Using the data we collected we make concrete recommendations on how to design web pages so as to minimize the energy needed <b>to</b> <b>render</b> the page. As an example, by modifying scripts on the Wikipedia mobile site we reduced by 30 % the energy needed <b>to</b> download and <b>render</b> Wikipedia pages with no change to the user experience. We conclude by estimating the point at which offloading browser computations to a remote proxy can save energy on the phone...|$|R
