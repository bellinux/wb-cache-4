The names of {{terraces}} in Penrhyndeudraeth, such as Glanllyn ("lakeside") and Penllyn ("end of the lake"), refer to a time when the site was underwater. There is also an area named Penlan ('the end of the tide'), which may point to the reason why <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> Penrhyndeudraeth is flat. It is believed that <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> Penrhyndeudraeth was founded on a spot behind the Royal Oak pub where the old Pierce & Sons garage is located.|$|R

Another cross-country trail system exists in the town of Jackson, extending as far as the summit of Wildcat Mountain.|$|E
5|$|For the {{original}} professional tournament in the 1970s, the English entrants were either First Division or Second Division sides. (The First Division sides had generally finished in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table, while the Second Division sides were generally mid-table or better.) With {{the exception of}} Bari and Como in 1973, all Italian teams playing in the 1970s tournament had just competed in the previous Serie A season. The Italian clubs were often mid-table or higher finishers who had sometimes also qualified for the European competitions.|$|E

The Nile River meanders in the far distance, emptying its seven arms into the Mediterranean at the Nile Delta. South of Cyprus is the Sinai Peninsula, which forms a land bridge between Africa and Southwest Asia. The Red Sea lies beyond, eventually merging – as the mountain ranges to its left and right do – with the curved horizon.|$|E

Rain dissolves some of the iron oxide and thus streaks Zion's cliffs red (the red streak seen on the Altar of Sacrifice is a famous example).

5|$|Given {{the history}} of {{migrants}} arriving in Chamba from across Kashmir and Tibet over the centuries, today Chamba {{has a variety of}} traditional dresses, defined by the region to which they belong. The most traditional dress worn by Hindu women, on special occasions, is the pashwaj. Pashwaj is a gown with a short bodice (blouse) covering up to the waist. A shirt is worn, below which the dress falls in many folds, nearly touching the ground. The typical casual dress though, however, is a pairahan, with a chadar or dupatta (stoll) worn over the head. <b>The</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body is covered by a pyjama, known as a suthan.|$|E

5|$|The incongruous make-up {{between the}} Western lower half and Thai roof has been {{compared}} with a Farang (Western) lady clothed in Victorian costume while wearing a Thai crown. The symbolism of this juxtaposition is the emphasis of the superiority of Thai architecture (as a crown upon the head) over those of the West (<b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body). This stylistic innovation was more than an artistic coincidence, as {{it was supposed to}} convey a significant political message of Siamese resistance over Western imperialism, both of sovereignty and style. From another perspective, the building itself epitomizes the internal political struggle between the ideas of Westernization and modernity (led by King Rama V) against those of the traditional ruling elites (as led by some of his early ministers).|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{in other}} winter disciplines, Australia {{started in the}} upper half of the field in the moguls; Nicholas Cleaver and Adrian Costa placed 11th and 14th out of 47 {{competitors}} in 1992. Since then, the results deteriorated into <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rankings, until 2006, when Canadian-born Dale Begg-Smith won gold and four Australians qualified for the 35-man competition. Manuela Berchtold, the only female Australian representative in 2006, came 14th out of 30 competitors. In 2010, Begg-Smith won silver, while two other moguls racers, one male and one female, were outside the top half and did not pass the first round.|$|E

5|$|City have {{previously}} worn three other badges on their shirts, {{prior to their}} current badge which was implemented in 2016. The first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular badge which used the same shield as the current badge, inside a circle bearing {{the name of the}} club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation which replaced <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shield with the red rose of Lancashire. On occasions when Manchester City plays in a major cup final, the usual badge has not been used; instead shirts bearing a badge of the arms of the City of Manchester are used, as a symbol of pride in representing the city of Manchester at a major event. This practice originates from a time when the players' shirts did not normally bear a badge of any kind, but has continued throughout the history of the club. For the 2011 FA Cup Final, City used the usual badge with a special legend, but the Manchester coat of arms was included as a small monochrome logo in the numbers on the back of players' shirts.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the canal}} began in 1822, with James Hollinsworth as the {{engineer}} and John Easton as the senior surveyor. The Bristol and Taunton scheme had incorporated a high-level crossing of the River Parrett, but the shortened canal would now join the Parrett at Huntworth, where a basin was to be constructed. This change of route resulted in the Reverend Robert Gray obtaining an injunction, and work on <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canal stopped until the new route could be properly authorised by the 1824 Act. By this time, the estimated cost had risen to £60,000. Below Durston, the canal was cut into the clay subsoil, the clay forming a naturally waterproof channel; but from Durston to Taunton the canal bed had to be puddled with clay to make it watertight, as the underlying ground was shale.|$|E
5|$|Frank Richards succeeded Watson as club {{secretary}} in 1911, {{and when the}} First World War broke out {{he took over the}} managerial reins as well. Under Richards Birmingham won the Second Division title in 1921 and signed players such as Joe Bradford, Johnny Crosbie and Dan Tremelling who did much to keep the club in the top flight through the 1920s. He also forgot to enter them in the 1922 FA Cup. Billy Beer and Bill Harvey kept them in the First Division, albeit in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table, before former Arsenal manager Leslie Knighton took charge in 1928. He led them to their first FA Cup final in 1931 and a top-half league finish the following year, but left when Chelsea made him an offer Birmingham were unable to match. Former Birmingham defender George Liddell kept them in the top tier until they were relegated in the last season completed before the Second World War, resigning in September 1939 when league football was suspended. His tenure of just over six years made him the club's longest-serving team manager.|$|E
