40|$|The {{part of the}} {{geostationary}} (GEO) {{orbital arc}} used for United States domestic fixed, communications service is rapidly becoming filled with satellites. One of the factors currently limiting its utilization is that communications satellites must be designed to have sufficient capacity to handle peak traffic leads, and thus are under utilized most of the time. A solution is to use satellites in suitable non-geostationary orbits to unload the traffic peaks. Three different designs for a non-geostationary orbit communications satellite system are presented for the 1995 time frame. The economic performance is analyzed and compared with geostationary satellites for two classes of service, trunking and customer premise service. The {{result is that the}} larger payload of the non-geostationary satellite offsets the burdens of increased complexity and worse radiation environment to give improved economic performance. Depending on ground terminal configuration, the improved economic performance of the space segment may be offset by increased ground <b>terminal</b> <b>expenses...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} revenue and expense {{recognition}} methods {{are currently being}} used by freight service companies, including (1) recognition of revenue when freight is received from the shipper or when freight leaves the carrier's <b>terminal</b> with <b>expenses</b> recognized as incurred, (2) recognition of revenue when freight is received from the shipper or when freight leaves the carrier's terminal with accrual of the estimated direct costs to complete delivery of freight-intransit, (3) recognition of both revenue and direct cost when the shipment is completed, (4) recognition of revenue when the shipment is completed with expenses recognized as incurred, and (5) the allocation of revenue between reporting periods based on relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred. The issue is what the appropriate accounting method(s) should be for recognizing revenue and expense related to a freight service company's freight-in-transit {{at the end of}} a reporting period. EITF DISCUSSION In 1980, the AICPA Motor Carriers Special Committee (Special Committee) prepared a draft of an Issues Paper (Issues Paper) entitled "Accounting for Recognition of Revenue for the Motor Carrier Industry " that discussed this issue.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a mobility tracking mechanism that combines a movement-based location update policy with a selective paging scheme. Movement-based location update is selected for its simplicity. It {{does not require}} ea & mobile terminal to store information about the arrangement and the distance relationship of all cells. In fact, each mobile terminal only keeps a counter {{of the number of}} cells visited. A location update is performed when this counter exceeds a predefined threshold value. This scheme allows the dynamic selection of the movement threshold on a per-user basis. This is desirable as different users may have very different mobility patterns. Selective paging reduces the cost for locating a mobile <b>terminal</b> in the <b>expense</b> of an increase in the paging delay. In this paper, we propose a selective paging scheme which significantly decreases the location tracking cost under a small increase in the allowable paging delay. We introduce an analytical model for the proposed location tracking mechanism which captures the mobility and the incoming call arrival patterns of each mobile terminal. Analytical results are provided to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of the proposed scheme under various parameters...|$|R
30|$|Ocean network {{communication}} {{is one of}} the most important research topics in the field of ocean information technology in the future. It plays an important role in vessel communication, ocean observation and military security. Currently, the main communication means of ocean vessels include HF and VHF radio communication [1 â€“ 3], onboard laser communication [4], cellular mobile network [5], and maritime satellite communication [6]. HF and VHF radio communication are vulnerable to atmospheric interference, thus having blind coverage areas and poor confidentiality. Its communication requires a predetermined frequency which makes it impossible to provide network service in large-scale ocean area. At present, it is only suitable for the internal communication among fleet of vessels and the directional communication to the seashore base station. Laser communication has many advantages, such as high bandwidth and confidentiality, but it is not suitable for providing general oceanic network communication services due to the targeting problem. Because of high cost of setting up the ocean base station, the cellular network cannot provide the network coverage for medium or long distance of sea area and frequent network data transmission will lead to high communication cost. Currently, maritime satellite {{communication is}} a good way of ocean network communication. However, the high price of <b>terminals</b> and communication <b>expenses</b> prohibit it from large-scale application.|$|R
