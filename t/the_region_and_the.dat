5|$|After {{the victory}} at Mycale, the Allied fleet sailed to the Hellespont {{to break down}} the pontoon bridges, but found that this was already done. The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians {{remained}} to attack the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians. The Persians in the region, and their allies, made for Sestos, the strongest town in <b>the</b> <b>region,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Athenians laid siege to them there. After a protracted siege, Sestos fell to the Athenians, marking {{the beginning of a new}} phase in the Greco-Persian Wars, the Greek counterattack. Herodotus ended his Histories after the Siege of Sestos. Over the next 30 years, the Greeks, primarily the Athenian-dominated Delian League, would expel (or help expel) the Persians from Macedon, Thrace, the Aegean islands and Ionia. Peace with Persia finally came in 449 BC with the Peace of Callias, finally ending the half-century of warfare.|$|E
5|$|Although the United States gained {{official}} {{possession of}} the region following {{the conclusion of the}} American Revolution, British influence on its Native American allies in the region remained strong, especially near Fort Detroit. This influence caused the Northwest Indian War, which began when British-influenced native tribes refused to recognize American authority and were backed in their resistance by British merchants in the area. American military victories in <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ratification of the Jay Treaty, which called for British withdrawal from the region's forts, caused a formal evacuation, but the British were not fully expelled from the area until the conclusion of the War of 1812.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn France, {{owing to}} the railway {{regionalization}} process, regional "governments" are finding themselves increasingly involved in transport policy-making. Based on a multidisciplinary comparative study conducted in six French regions, this paper aims to analyze {{the ways in which}} regional rail policies are constructed by examining, in particular, the way they are generated as a result of interactions between different institutional actors. These interactions are linked to tensions in three main areas: the financing of transport investments, <b>the</b> financing <b>and</b> nature of rail services and regional governance. We examine these tensions by referring to three configurations of actors: <b>the</b> first includes <b>the</b> <b>Regions</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> State, <b>the</b> second, <b>the</b> <b>Regions</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rail actors, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> third, <b>the</b> <b>Regions</b> <b>and</b> other local authorities. Finally, we discuss our findings, emphasizing what they teach us about the regionalization process in France...|$|R

5|$|In early 1941 the 6th Division and ICorps {{headquarters}} {{took part}} in the ill-fated Allied expedition to defend Greece from a German invasion. The corps' commander, Lieutenant-General Thomas Blamey, and Prime Minister Menzies both regarded the operation as risky, but agreed to Australian involvement after the British Government provided them with briefings which deliberately understated the chance of defeat. The Allied force deployed to Greece was much smaller than the German force in <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> defence of the country was compromised by inconsistencies between Greek and Allied plans.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to British activity in <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reluctance {{of the inhabitants}} of Île de France to follow orders from the National Convention abolishing slavery, the French dispatched a squadron of frigates to the East Indies early in 1796. This force, led by Contre-amiral Pierre César Charles de Sercey, originally comprised three frigates, subsequently joined by three more vessels, forming a powerful raiding squadron. After resupplying on Île de France in July, Sercey's frigates cruised off the Ceylon coast, dissuaded from attacking the undefended ports of British India by false information fed to his scouts that a British battle squadron was at anchor in Calcutta. Turning eastwards, Sercey hoped to raid George Town at Penang, but was driven off in an inconclusive engagement with a British squadron off Sumatra on 9 September. He spent the winter sheltering in Batavia on Java.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the action, Venerable was towed off the shoreline and back to Gibraltar for repairs, while the remainder of the British squadron restored the British blockade of the French and Spanish ships in Cadiz, returning the situation to that in place before the battle. This British victory, coming so soon after Saumarez's defeat in Algeciras harbour, did much to restore parity in <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> heavy casualties inflicted on the Spanish were to contribute to a weakening of the Franco-Spanish alliance which was a contributory factor in the signing of Treaty of Amiens, which brought the war to a temporary halt early the following year. In France, despite the heavy Spanish losses, the battle was celebrated as a victory, with Troude widely praised and promoted for the defence of his ship.|$|E

5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{part of the}} 19th century the area which is today Minnesota was not {{recognized}} as a single entity. The Mississippi River had divided the eastern British/French lands of North America from the western Spanish lands and even after the Louisiana Purchase this was for a time seen as a separation between territories. The division between the U.S. territories in <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> British territories remained ambiguous until the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, which set the border with British North America at the 49th parallel west of the Lake of the Woods (except for a small chunk of land now dubbed the Northwest Angle). Border disputes east of the Lake of the Woods continued until the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842.|$|E

5|$|Worthington's eldest son, {{also named}} William (1764–1825), assumed {{control of the}} company {{following}} his father's death. On the death of Worthington in 1825 he was succeeded by his son, also named William (1799–1871). A combination of factors conspired to make the Baltic trade infeasible; the Napoleonic Wars disrupted trade in <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Russian government increased import tariffs in 1822. Combined with a decrease on malt duty in 1823, this led to an oversupply of beer in Burton. As a result, the brewers instead looked towards the expatriate community in India as an increasingly important export market. Worthington produced their own India Pale Ale from 1829 onwards.|$|E
5|$|A lack of {{stability}} continually plagued the team. The franchise never {{won more than}} 22 games and {{did not return to}} the playoffs after 1977–78 in its six seasons in Colorado. Prior to the 1978–79 season, the team was sold to New Jersey trucking tycoon Arthur Imperatore, who intended to move the team to his home state. The plan was criticized due to the existence of three other NHL teams in <b>the</b> <b>region,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> proposed New Jersey arena was still under construction; the franchise ultimately stayed in Denver. In 1979, the team hired Don Cherry as head coach and featured forward Lanny McDonald. The Rockies still posted the worst record in the NHL, and Cherry was subsequently fired after the season. After two more years in Denver, the Rockies were sold to a group headed by John McMullen (who also owned Major League Baseball's Houston Astros) on May 27, 1982, and the franchise moved to New Jersey. As part of the relocation deal, the Devils had to compensate the three existing teams in the region – the New York Islanders, New York Rangers and Flyers – for encroaching on their territory.|$|E
