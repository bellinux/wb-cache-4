The ±450kV high-voltage direct current line in Hydro-Québec's power grid uses a T-shaped tower, lattice or pole, to support two bundles of three conductors on each side. The direct current power line sometimes uses <b>two</b> <b>poles</b> or a wider, pyramidal, self-supporting lattice structure for angle towers.|$|E

25|$|Following his {{championship}} season, Elliott {{broke his}} wrist {{in a crash}} during testing at Daytona and required relief by Jody Ridley during several races {{in the first part}} of the 1989 season. Elliott won <b>two</b> <b>poles</b> and three races and finished sixth in the championship standings. In 1990, Elliott won one race and <b>two</b> <b>poles</b> and finished fourth in the championship standings. In the 1990 race at Atlanta, Elliott's rear tire changer Mike Rich was killed when Ricky Rudd lost control of his car, spun, and slammed the crew member between his car and Elliott's. This forced NASCAR to restrict the cars' speed on pit road. The 1991 season saw Elliott's sponsorship change to Coors Light and the familiar red on the car was replaced with blue. Elliott won once in the Pepsi 400 and won <b>two</b> <b>poles</b> and finished eleventh in the championship standings during his last season with Mellings.|$|E

25|$|If a {{particular}} point on a sphere is (arbitrarily) designated as its north pole, then the corresponding antipodal point {{is called the}} south pole, and the equator is the great circle that is equidistant to them. Great circles through the <b>two</b> <b>poles</b> are called lines (or meridians) of longitude, and the line connecting the <b>two</b> <b>poles</b> is called the axis of rotation. Circles on the sphere that are parallel to the equator are lines of latitude. This terminology is also used for such approximately spheroidal astronomical bodies as the planet Earth (see geoid).|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Schrader {{was hired}} to drive the No. 33 Skoal Bandit-sponsored Chevrolet Monte Carlo for Andy Petree Racing.

50|$|The impulse {{responses}} of these filters {{are not very}} close to gaussian unless more than <b>two</b> <b>pole</b> pairs are used.

25|$|As an aside, it may {{be noted}} that {{real-world}} departures from this linear two-pole model occur due to two major complications: first, real amplifiers have more than <b>two</b> <b>poles,</b> as well as zeros; and second, real amplifiers are nonlinear, so their step response changes with signal amplitude.|$|E
25|$|A {{positive}} IOD index often negates {{the effect}} of ENSO, resulting in increased monsoon rains in years such as 1983, 1994, and 1997. Further, the <b>two</b> <b>poles</b> of the IOD — the eastern pole (around Indonesia) and the western pole (off the African coast) — independently and cumulatively affect the quantity of monsoon rains.|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 17 - 22 An {{introduction}} to <b>two</b> <b>pole</b> motor mechanics is presented, {{with the goal}} of promoting an understanding of normal and abnormal vibration sources to assist in the diagnosis of the field problems of such motors. Motor force vectors are reviewed, which define sample frequencies and magnitudes for the normal mechanical and electrical causes. Tables of sources of both normal and abnormal forces are presented which enable the reader to calculate the frequencies involved and possible causes for excessive levels. Sum and difference frequencies (beat) are complicating factors in such motors and a brief nonmathematical discussion of such processes is presented, in terms of <b>two</b> <b>pole</b> motor vectors. A case problem is presented, showing an example of <b>two</b> <b>pole</b> motor beat frequencies and the associated sidebands in such problem cases...|$|R

Depending on the classification, other equipment may be used by skiers including guide skiers, cut-down ski poles, orthopedic aids, or prostheses. For standing skiers, different class rules determine what sort of equipment is allowed in competition, such as one pole, <b>two</b> <b>poles</b> or no poles, or one or two skis. Rules for equipment use in competition are set by FIS and the IPC.|$|E

25|$|The {{weight of}} the vehicle has been {{estimated}} at 25–30kg, with a maximum manned weight of 100kg. The biga is typically built with a single draught pole for a double yoke, while <b>two</b> <b>poles</b> are used for a quadriga. The chariot for a two-horse racing team is not thought to differ otherwise from that drawn by a four-horse team, and so the horses of a biga pulled 50kg each, while those of the quadriga pulled 25kg each.|$|E

25|$|When the {{open-loop}} gain has several poles, {{rather than the}} single pole of the above example, feedback can result in complex poles (real and imaginary parts). In a two-pole case, the result is peaking in the frequency response of the feedback amplifier near its corner frequency and ringing and overshoot in its step response. In the case of more than <b>two</b> <b>poles,</b> the feedback amplifier can become unstable and oscillate. See the discussion of gain margin and phase margin. For a complete discussion, see Sansen.|$|E

25|$|Strmiska {{argues that}} these <b>two</b> <b>poles</b> could be termed reconstructionism and eclecticism, respectively. Reconstructionists do not {{altogether}} reject innovation in their interpretation and {{adaptation of the}} source material, however they {{do believe that the}} source material conveys greater authenticity and thus should be emphasized. They often follow scholarly debates about the nature of such pre-Christian religions, and some reconstructionists are themselves scholars. Eclectic Pagans, conversely, seek general inspiration from the pre-Christian past, and do not attempt to recreate past rites or traditions with specific attention to detail.|$|E
