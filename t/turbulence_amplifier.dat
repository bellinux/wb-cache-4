40|$|Graduation date: 1966 An {{experimental}} study {{was made of}} acoustic switching of pneumatic turbulence amplifiers. The development of fluidic devices was generally reviewed, and {{the operation of the}} pneumatic turbulence amplifiers made for testing was described. The characteristics of the turbulence amplifiers were experimentally determined and found to be typical for this type of device. Two acoustic switching devices, the sonic vibrating reed and the acoustic resonance sensor, were introduced. The vibrating reeds vibrated at their natural frequency to interrupt the control jet of a <b>turbulence</b> <b>amplifier</b> and the acoustic resonance sensor interrupted the control jet, when resonance occurred in the resonator chamber. Both devices produced <b>turbulence</b> <b>amplifier</b> switching when excited by proper acoustic signals. Their basic response characteristics were determined. The vibrating reeds produced satisfactorily switching at signal resonance frequencies between 40 to 100 cycles per second, while the resonance sensors operated between 400 and 2000 cycles per second. The response time for both switching devices was found to be approximately 0. 24 second. Further work is necessary to demonstrate satisfactory switching when the acoustic signals contain tones of several frequencies...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} a {{bistable}} electro-pneumatic interface based on laminar-to-turbulent jet transition is herein presented. This principle, {{used in the past}} to produce air stream controlled ﬂuidic <b>turbulence</b> <b>ampliﬁers,</b> is now applied to a new interface driven by acoustic waves and controlled through very low power electrical signals. The study was performed experimentally, attempting to ﬁnd the optimum interface geometry and analysing its sensitivity to acoustic signals in a frequency range from 2 to 20 kHz and at diﬀerent excitation levels. A piezo-electric buzzer was used as sound source, resulting in a device with electric power consumption of less than 5 mW, able to switch common low/high pressure pneumatic valves...|$|R
