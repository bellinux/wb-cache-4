5|$|Reznor {{assembled}} the first live line-up in 1988 {{to support the}} Canadian industrial music band Skinny Puppy on tour. The three-piece band consisted of Reznor on guitars and lead vocals, Ron Musarra on drums, and Chris Vrenna on keyboards. The band was poorly received, however, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to leave the tour after 10 dates. After the Skinny Puppy tour the band was rearranged and expanded to include a fourth member; Musarra departed and Vrenna moved to drums, Gary Talpas, Nick Rushe, and later David Hymes contributed on keyboards, while Richard Patrick was added as guitarist.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} move, Rowe formed {{a new group}} under Herbert Skinner to develop the {{magnetron}} into an AI system, at that time known as AI, Sentimetric (AIS). Lovell adapted his parabolic antennas to the magnetron with relative ease, and the AIS team immediately detected a passing aircraft when they turned on the set {{for the first time}} on 12 August 1940. The next day <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to demonstrate the set for managers, but no airplane happened to be flying by. Instead, they had one of the workers bicycle along a nearby cliff carrying a small plate of aluminum sheet. This neatly demonstrated its ability to detect objects very close to the ground. As AIS rapidly developed into the AI Mk. VII, development of the Mk. IV's follow-ons, the Mk. V, and Mk. VI (see below) saw vacillating support.|$|E

5|$|Despite their celebrated {{success at}} turning {{spectacular}} plays in collaboration, {{relations between the}} teammates {{were said to have}} been often strained. Tinker and Evers feuded for many years. On September 14, 1905, Tinker and Evers engaged in a fistfight on the field because Evers had taken a cab to the stadium and left his teammates behind in the hotel lobby. They did not speak for years following this event. According to some tellings, Tinker and Evers did not speak to one another again following their fight for 33 years, until <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to participate in the radio broadcast of the 1938 World Series, between the Cubs and the New York Yankees.

30|$|Phase 1) Introduction: At the {{beginning}} of each interview the participants <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> general questions to obtain basic data about the interviewees.

Furthermore, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> about their knowledge of Cyber Threat Intelligence and the STIX format in particular to determine their level of expertise. This first phase showed, that even though interviewees are familiar with threat intelligence information in general, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> rather unfamiliar with the specifics of the STIX format in most cases.

25|$|In a {{study of}} Richards and Gross (1999) and Tiwari (2013), {{participants}} viewed slides of injured men that produced increases in negative emotions, while information concerning each man was presented orally with his slide.
