5|$|The {{amendment}} defined pornography as a {{civil rights}} violation against women, and allowed women who claimed harm from pornography to sue the producers and distributors in civil court for damages. The law was passed twice by the Minneapolis city council, but vetoed both times by Mayor Don Fraser, who considered the wording of <b>the</b> <b>ordinance</b> to be too vague. Another version of <b>the</b> <b>ordinance</b> passed in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1984, but was overturned as unconstitutional under the First Amendment by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in the case American Booksellers v. Hudnut. Dworkin continued to support the civil rights approach in her writing and activism, and supported anti-pornography feminists who organized later campaigns in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1985) and Bellingham, Washington (1988) to pass versions of <b>the</b> <b>ordinance</b> by voter initiative.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ordinances</b> of 1311 were {{a series}} of {{regulations}} imposed upon King Edward II by the peerage and clergy of the Kingdom of England to restrict {{the power of the}} king. The twenty-one signatories of <b>the</b> <b>Ordinances</b> are referred to as the Lords Ordainers, or simply the Ordainers. English setbacks in the Scottish war, combined with perceived extortionate royal fiscal policies, set the background for the writing of <b>the</b> <b>Ordinances</b> in which <b>the</b> administrative prerogatives of the king were largely appropriated by a baronial council. <b>The</b> <b>Ordinances</b> reflect <b>the</b> Provisions of Oxford and the Provisions of Westminster from the late 1250s, but unlike <b>the</b> Provisions, <b>the</b> <b>Ordinances</b> featured a new concern with fiscal reform, specifically redirecting revenues from the king's household to the exchequer.|$|R

2500|$|In sum, the {{neutrality}} inquiry {{leads to}} one conclusion: <b>The</b> <b>ordinances</b> had as their object {{the suppression of}} religion.

5|$|Humphrey first ran {{for mayor}} of Minneapolis in 1943, losing by only six {{thousand}} votes. He campaigned again in the 1945 election, {{with the support of}} the city's labor leaders, and found support with the city's African-American community by promising to implement a city civil rights commission. He also appealed to the city's middle class by giving talks on civic virtue at area churches. He was elected in 1945 by the largest margin to date. When elected, he immediately proposed a city ordinance that would make racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine. After a long period of discussion, the Minneapolis City Council finally approved <b>the</b> <b>ordinance</b> by a 21 to 3 margin on January 31, 1947. <b>The</b> <b>ordinance</b> created the nation's first Fair Employment Practices Ordinance and established Minneapolis as the nation's leader in imposing fines for employment discrimination, though pressure from the local Urban League would also limit employment opportunities for African Americans during the ordinance's first few years.|$|E

5|$|In a book {{he wrote}} in the 1970s, Audisio argued that the {{decision}} to execute Mussolini taken at the meeting in Dongo of the partisan leaders on 28 April constituted a valid judgment of a tribunal under Article 15 of the CNLAI's ordinance on the Constitution of Courts of War.

5|$|Save Our Children, Inc. was a {{political}} coalition formed in 1977 in Miami, Florida to overturn a recently legislated county ordinance that banned discrimination in areas of housing, employment, and public accommodation based on sexual orientation. The coalition was publicly headed by celebrity singer Anita Bryant, who claimed <b>the</b> <b>ordinance</b> discriminated against her right to teach her children biblical morality. It was a well-organized campaign that initiated a bitter political fight between unprepared gay activists and highly motivated Christian fundamentalists. When the repeal of <b>the</b> <b>ordinance</b> went to a vote, it attracted the largest response of any special election in Dade County's history, passing by 70%. In response to this vote, a group {{of gay and lesbian}} community members formed Pride South Florida, now known as Pride Fort Lauderdale, an organization whose mission was to fight for the rights of the gay and lesbian community in South Florida.|$|E

5|$|In {{the midst}} of his exile, Zardari had several {{different}} legal problems. In Pakistan, Musharraf granted him amnesty for his alleged offences through the National Reconciliation Ordinance, drafted in October 2007. However, <b>the</b> <b>ordinance</b> faced mounting public pressure and an uncompromising judiciary. In addition, it only dealt with charges up to 1999. This left open the possibility of investigations into his alleged involvement in about $2 million in illegal kickbacks to Saddam Hussein, discovered in October 2005, under the oil-for-food program. If <b>the</b> <b>ordinance</b> was rescinded, {{he would have had to}} deal with charges relating to evading duties on an armoured BMW, commissions from a Polish tractor manufacturer, and a kickback from a gold bullion dealer. In Switzerland, Bhutto and Zardari appealed the 2003 Swiss conviction, which required the reopening of the case in October 2007. In November 2007, Swiss authorities returned the frozen $60 million to him through offshore companies because of the National Reconciliation Ordinance. In Spain, a criminal investigation was opened over the money laundering for the oil-for-food program because of the illicit profits handled through Spanish firms. In Britain, he was fighting a civil case against the Pakistani government for the proceeds from the liquidation sale of a Surrey mansion. He successfully used his medical diagnosis to postpone a verdict on his British manor trial.|$|E
