5|$|In 1998, when {{analysts were}} given {{a tour of the}} Enron Energy Services office, they were {{impressed}} with how the employees were working so vigorously. In reality, Skilling had moved other employees to the office from other departments (instructing them to pretend <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard)</b> <b>to</b> create the appearance that the division was larger than it was. This ruse was used several times to fool analysts about the progress of different areas of Enron to help improve the stock price.|$|E

The financial situation was always tight, and taught everyone in the family discipline and <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> survive. To support the family, Alma worked as an accountant and clerk. Philipp's father paid a monthly alimony of 35 Reichsmark (RM) until 1933. Initially he had to be reminded by his mother of his obligations. Philipp was baptized on 29 July 1917, taking the name Johannes Fritz, and was confirmed in 1931.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{increased}} afterload, the ventricle has <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> accomplish its goal of ejecting blood into the aorta. Thus in the long-term, {{the increased}} afterload (due to the stenosis) will result in hypertrophy of the left ventricle {{to account for the}} increased work required.|$|R
50|$|Left {{ventricular}} afterload {{is affected}} by various disease conditions. Hypertension increases the afterload, since the LV has <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> overcome the elevated arterial peripheral resistance and decreased compliance. Aortic valve diseases like aortic stenosis and insufficiency also increase the afterload, whereas mitral valve regurgitation decreases the afterload.|$|R
5000|$|Not all reviews were {{positive}} though. Alex Doenau of Trespass commented [...] "There simply isn't enough dynamism to justify Sen's story.

25|$|Suazo's {{performance}} {{during his first}} tournament wasn't what was expected (only three goals in twelve games) and combined with conflicts with teammates and coaches. It led to speculations that Suazo had been sold to Argentine club Independiente. However, the deal fell through once the Argentine club refused to pay $8million for the transfer. On 4 January, Humberto called for a press conference, {{and in front of}} television cameras and news media, he acknowledged the fact that his performance and attitude wasn't positive during his first 6 months with the club, but that from now on, he was determined to change things. He was going to take responsibility for his actions and commit himself <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> achieve better results.|$|E
25|$|Regarded {{as one of}} {{the best}} English centre-backs of his generation, Campbell was a strong, {{athletic}} and imposing defender, with a good positional sense, and was also a strong tackler. Due to his height and physical power, he excelled in the air, both offensively and defensively, although he initially had <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> improve his heading ability during his teenage years. He did not possess good natural stamina, but had pace, power, agility and quick feet, as well as significant mental strength. Due to his versatility and range of skills, as well as his ability to carry the ball out of defence and get forward, he was also capable of playing as a right-back on occasion. However, despite being fairly comfortable in possession, he frequently drew criticism throughout his career for his poor distribution.|$|E
500|$|One {{criticism}} that Steve Claridge had when analysing Hooper's game was that [...] " [...] played at either breakneck speed when involved in play or at walking pace when not", Claridge noted that Hooper needed <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> make himself available to his teammates for passes, especially long balls out from defence.|$|R

25|$|A popular {{explanation}} {{in early}} Norwegian historiography (late 19th, early 20th century) was {{a conflict between}} the royal power and the aristocracy (the lendmenn). According to this view, by historians such as P.A. Munch, J.E. Sars and Gustav Storm, the aristocracy saw the king as a tool by which they governed the country. Consequently, they supported weak kings but were eventually beaten by the strong king Sverre. The same views are expounded concerning {{the involvement of the}} Church. These explanations lost credence as {{it became clear that the}} lendmenn seemed to be evenly split on different sides, both before and after King Sverre. Sverre himself even had some of the lendmenn on his side. Knut Helle has emphasised how the Church, after Sverre's death, seemed <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> bring about reconciliation between warring parties, and stability.|$|E

[...] Expanding on the love triangle that forms between Wilkes, Sousa, and Carter, Austin said, [...] "we’re very nice to each other. We’re professional.

5000|$|A {{so-called}} [...] "pumping loss" [...] is {{also cited}} as causing extra {{work for the}} engine to do under partial load conditions because the pistons have <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> suck in the fuel-air mixture when the throttle position results in low intake-manifold pressure.
