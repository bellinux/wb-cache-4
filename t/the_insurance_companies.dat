5|$|During the 1906 {{legislative}} session, Beckham urged {{investigation and}} prosecution of corrupt insurance companies, {{following the lead of}} New York attorney Charles Evans Hughes. In particular, he recommended reducing the practice of deferred dividends, which allowed <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> to keep large stores of cash on-hand for illegal purposes. He further advocated that insurance companies doing business in the state be required to invest a certain percentage of their earnings in Kentucky, bolstering the its economy and providing policyholders some protection against fraud.|$|E
5|$|Tara {{finds her}} {{strength}} in Shiv, a wiser and more experienced counterpart. The two start {{spending most of}} their spare time together coping with their grief, despite being completely opposite in nature. Shiv takes Tara to the temple, and she takes him shopping. Rajat's doctor, Nirupam Malhotra (Rajat Kapoor), tells Tara that Rajat has a hematoma in his brain and an operation might help him recover, but it carries the risk of partial paralysis. Tara is torn, as she believes Rajat {{would not want to}} take the risk, and seeks advice from Shiv. He is already at loggerheads with Dr. Malhotra, dismissing him as a pawn of the hospital board and <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> who only care about making money and not the patients. Tara and Shiv get into a heated argument. Shiv lashes out angrily at Tara for not giving Rajat a chance at life. Tara retorts that she is a realist, and dismisses Shiv for being selfish and making his wife go through pain for his own sake.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{a typical}} {{participating}} life <b>insurance</b> contract, <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> is en-titled to {{a share of}} the return surplus as compensation for the return guarantee granted to policyholders. This call-option-like stake gives <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> an incentive to increase the riskiness of its investments {{at the expense of the}} policyholders. The conflict of interests can partially be solved by regulation deterring <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> from taking excessive risk. In a utility-based framework where default is modeled continuously by a structural approach, we show that a flexible design of regulatory supervision can be beneficial for both the policyholder and <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company...</b>|$|R

25|$|She {{applied for}} the {{insurance}} money the day after her husband's funeral. Sorenson's relatives claimed that Gunness had poisoned her husband to collect on the insurance.

25|$|On 26 July 1897, the Advance was {{anchored}} in Botany Bay {{at the entrance}} to Cooks River, when a fierce squall drove her onto Lady Robinsons Beach. An inquiry into the stranding found that the port chain had parted and the other anchor had dragged. The wreck was sold by <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> and repurchased by the former owner. The vessel was described to have been carried away up on the beach and left there high and dry by the receding tide. She was found so far away from water that it would be necessary to dig a channel especially for her to be launched by means of towing power.|$|E
50|$|Physicians {{and other}} {{healthcare}} practitioners {{who wish to}} bill an <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> and receive reimbursement for services as an in-network provider must undergo a process of credentialing in which <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> verifies <b>the</b> providers education, training, experience, and competency. Each provider must submit a credentialing application that details their training and qualifications to treat patients in their area of specialty. <b>The</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> then decides if the provider meets their internal qualifications {{to serve as a}} provider of services to their insured customers. After approval of a provider's credentials, <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> issues a participating provider contract that allows the provider of services to bill <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> and receive reimbursement as an in-network provider of services.|$|R
5000|$|Usually <b>the</b> {{values that}} <b>insurance</b> {{adjusters}} receive are either left-truncated, right-censored, or both. For example, if policyholders {{are subject to}} a policy limit u, then any loss amounts that are actually above u are reported to <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> as being exactly u because u is <b>the</b> amount <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> pays. <b>The</b> insurer knows that the actual loss is greater than u but they don't know what it is. On the other hand, left truncation occurs when policyholders are subject to a deductible. If policyholders are subject to a deductible d, any loss amount that is less than d will not even be reported to <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company.</b> If there is a claim on a policy limit of u and a deductible of d, any loss amount that is greater than u will be reported to <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> as a loss of [...] because that is <b>the</b> amount <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> has to pay. Therefore, insurance loss data is left-truncated because <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> doesn't know if there are values below the deductible d because policyholders won't make a claim. <b>The</b> <b>insurance</b> loss is also right-censored if the loss is greater than u because u is <b>the</b> most <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> will pay.

25|$|In January 1872 Isaac Rich died, {{leaving the}} vast {{bulk of his}} estate to a trust that would go to Boston University after ten years of growth while the University was organized. Most of this bequest {{consisted}} of real estate throughout {{the core of the}} city of Boston which was appraised at more than $1.5 million. Kilgore describes this as the largest single donation to an American college or university to that time. By December, however, the Great Boston Fire of 1872 had destroyed {{all but one of the}} buildings Rich had left to the University, and <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> with which they had been insured were bankrupt. The value of his estate, when turned over to the University in 1882, was half what it had been in 1872.|$|E
25|$|In 1865, the {{volunteer}} fire department was abolished {{by a state}} act which created the Metropolitan Fire District and the Metropolitan Fire Department (MFD). This effectively gave control of the fire departments in the cities of New York and Brooklyn to the Governor who appointed his Board of Commissioners. There was never any effective incorporation of the fire departments of the two cities during this period. It wasn't until the Greater City of New York was consolidated in 1898 that the two were combined under one common organization or organizational structure. The change met with a mixed reaction from the citizens, {{and some of the}} eliminated volunteers became bitter and resentful, which resulted in both political battles and street fights. <b>The</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> in the city, however, finally won the battle and had {{the volunteer}}s replaced with paid professionals. The members of the paid fire department were primarily selected from the prior volunteers. All of the volunteer's apparatus, including their fire houses, were seized by the state who made use of them to form the new organization and form the basis of the current FDNY. The MFD lasted until 1870 when the Tweed Charter ended state control in the city. As a result, a new Board of Fire Commissioners was created and the original name of the Fire Department City of New York (FDNY) was reinstated.|$|E
500|$|The Ralston-Purina company, {{headed by}} the Danforth family, was {{headquartered}} in the city, and Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest brewery, remained a fixture of the city's economy into the 21st century.

[...] The Desloge Consolidated Lead Company, the largest lead mining concern in the country, {{headed by the}} Desloge family, was headquartered downtown.

50|$|Once {{a person}} {{purchases}} a policy, the language cannot {{be changed by}} <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company,</b> and <b>the</b> policy usually is guaranteed renewable for life.

50|$|Another example, in {{the state}} of Oklahoma, drivers must carry at least state minimum {{liability}} limits of $25,000/$50,000/$25,000. If an insured driver hits a car full of people and is found by <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> to be liable, <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> will pay $25,000 of one person's medical bills but will not exceed $50,000 for other people injured in <b>the</b> accident. <b>The</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> will not pay more than $25,000 for property damage in repairs to the vehicle that the insured one hit.|$|R
50|$|All values {{related to}} the policy (death benefits, cash {{surrender}} values, premiums) are usually determined at policy issue, {{for the life of}} the contract, and usually cannot be altered after issue. This means that <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> assumes all risk of future performance versus the actuaries' estimates. If future claims are underestimated, <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> makes up <b>the</b> difference. On the other hand, if the actuaries' estimates on future death claims are high, <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> will retain <b>the</b> difference.|$|R
500|$|Although the {{evidence}} in Gibraltar failed to support Flood's theories of murder and conspiracy, the suspicion of foul play lingered. Insurance fraud {{on the part of}} Winchester was briefly suspected, on the grounds of newspaper reports that Mary Celeste had been heavily over-insured. Winchester was able to refute these allegations, and no inquiry was instituted by <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> that issued the policies. In 1931 an article in the Quarterly Review suggested that Morehouse could have lain in wait for Mary Celeste, then lured Briggs and his crew aboard Dei Gratia and killed them there. Paul Begg, in his account of the mystery, comments that this theory ignores undisputed facts: Dei Gratia left New York eight days after Mary Celeste, was a slower ship, and would not have caught Mary Celeste before the latter reached Gibraltar. Another theory posits that Briggs and Morehouse were partners in a conspiracy to share the salvage proceedings. The unsubstantiated friendship between the two captains has been cited by commentators as making such a plan a plausible explanation. Hicks comments that, [...] "If Morehouse and Briggs had been planning such a scam, they would not have devised such an attention-drawing mystery," [...] and also asks why, if Briggs intended to disappear permanently, he left his son Arthur behind.|$|E
