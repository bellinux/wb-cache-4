50|$|It is {{possible}} to determine who the biological father of the fetus is while the woman is still pregnant through procedures called chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. Choronic villus sampling (CVS) retrieves choronic villus (placental tissue) in either a <b>transcervical</b> or transabdominal manner. Amniocentesis retrieves amniotic fluid by inserting a needle through the pregnant mother's abdominal wall. These procedures are highly accurate because they are taking a sample directly from the fetus; however, {{there is a small}} risk for the woman to miscarry and lose the pregnancy as a result. Both CVS and Amnio require the pregnant woman to visit a genetic specialist known as a maternal fetal medicine specialist who will perform the procedure.|$|E
50|$|Diagnostic {{prenatal}} testing can {{be performed}} by invasive or non-invasive methods. An invasive method involves probes or needles being inserted into the uterus, e.g. amniocentesis, which can be done from about 14 weeks gestation, and usually up to about 20 weeks, and chorionic villus sampling, which can be done earlier (between 9.5 and 12.5 weeks gestation) but which may be slightly more risky to the fetus. One study comparing transabdominal chorionic villus sampling with second trimester amniocentesis found no signiﬁcant difference in the total pregnancy loss between the two procedures. However, <b>transcervical</b> chorionic villus sampling carries a signiﬁcantly higher risk, compared with a second trimester amniocentesis, of total pregnancy loss (relative risk 1.40; 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.81) and spontaneous miscarriage (9.4% risk; relative risk 1.50; 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 2.11).|$|E
5000|$|Historically, surgery {{provided}} the single approach to {{head and neck}} cancer. Surgical management of OPC carried significant morbidity with a <b>transcervical</b> approach (via the neck) and often involving mandibulotomy (splitting the mandible). Improvements in surgical techniques have allowed many tumours to be removed (resected) by a transoral approaches (through the mouth). This approach has proven safety, efficacy and tolerability, and include two main minimally invasive techniques, transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and transoral laser microsurgery (TLM). No direct comparisons of these two techniques have been conducted, and clinical trials in head and neck cancer such as ECOG 3311 allow either. They are associated with substantial postoperative morbidity, depending on extent of resection but compared to older techniqueshave shorter hospital stay, faster recovery, less pain, and less need for gastrostomy or tracheostomy, and less long term effects, which are minimal {{in the absence of}} postoperative radiation (RT), or chemoradiation (CRT). TORS has the practical advantage that angled telescopes and rotating robotic surgical arms provide better line of sight. Outcomes of minimally invasive procedures also compare favourably with more invasive ones. In early stage disease, including involvement of neck nodes, TORS produces a 2-year survival of 80-90%. TLM similarly, is reported to have a five-year survival of 78% and local control rates of 85-97%. In addition to early disease, minimally invasive surgery has been used in advanced cases, with up to 90% local control and disease specific survival. Postoperative swallowing was excellent in 87%, but long term dysphagia was associated with larger (T4) cancers, especially if involving the base of the tongue.|$|E
50|$|The {{historical}} {{treatment of}} OPC was surgical, with an approach through the neck (<b>transcervical)</b> and splitting of the jaw bone (mandible), with considerable morbidity. Later, radiotherapy {{with or without}} the addition of chemotherapy (chemoradiotherapy), provided a less invasive alternative, and the results in terms of treating the cancer, were considered comparable. Newer minimally invasive surgical techniques through the mouth (transoral) have reduced morbidity, and surgery is often followed by radiation and or chemotherapy in high risk cases. In the absence of high quality evidence through clinical trials, patient management decisions are often based on technical factors, likely functional loss and patient preferences. Some HPV+OPC may first appear in lymph nodes in the neck (cervical nodes), without an obvious source (cancer of unknown primary origin) but removal of tonsil tissue from the oropharynx will often show hidden disease there. The presence of HPV in the tumour is associated with a better response to treatment and a better outcome, independent of the treatment methods used and a nearly 60% reduced risk of dying from the cancer. Most recurrence occurs locally and within the first year after treatment. The use of tobacco decreases the chances of survival. While most head and neck cancer has been declining with reduced smoking rates, HPV+OPC has been increasing. Compared to HPV-OPC patients, HPV+OPC patients tend to be younger, have a higher socioeconomic status and are less likely to smoke. In addition they tend to have smaller tumours, but {{are more likely to have}} involvement of the cervical lymph nodes. In the United States and other countries, the number of cases of oropharyngeal cancer has been increasing steadily, with the incidence of HPV+OPC increasing faster than the decline in HPV-OPC. The increase is seen particularly in young men in developed countries, and HPV+OPC now accounts for the majority of all OPC cases.|$|E

The audit design: A retrospective re-audit. The setting: A district general hospital in the North West region of England, U.K. The patients: Forty-seven women with heavy menstrual bleeding that required treatment with <b>transcervical</b> resection of the endometrium. The interventions: <b>Transcervical</b> resection of the endometrium, cervical dilatation and the insertion of levonorgestrel-releasing intra uterine system.

40|$|Introduction: Monoamniotic {{twins are}} {{considered}} a cause of high-risk pregnancies. Thereby, discordant malformations do occur rarely. A discordant exencephaly has been described {{in only a few}} cases. <b>Transcervical</b> embryoscopy can be performed in cases of monoamniotic twins with missed abortion directly before the abort-curettage. Case Report: The case of a 35 -year-old G 1 /P 0 women in the 12 (th) week of pregnancy is described. She had a monoamniotic twin pregnancy with discordant exencephaly and missed abortion diagnosed at 11 + 2 weeks. A <b>transcervical</b> embryoscopy was performed immediately before the abort-curettage and identified the discordant exencephaly and an additional umbilical cord knot of the 2 foetuses as a probable cause for the abortion. Discussion: The <b>transcervical</b> embryoscopy lead in our case report to the diagnosis of a umbilical cord knot in a monoamniotic twin pregnancy with missed abortion. We also identified a discordant exencephaly by embryoscopy. With blunt access to the amniotic cavity, the <b>transcervical</b> embryoscopy applies only a minor additional risk to the abort-curettage. However, it should only be performed when the patient explicitly asks for enhanced diagnostics.
