5|$|Bigfin reef squids {{are also}} {{valuable}} sources for squid giant axons used in research in neuroscience and physiology. Unlike axons of other animals, squid axons are very large.

In life, these giant axons are used by the squids to coordinate escape jetting behaviour, enabling <b>the</b> <b>squid</b> to contract its muscles {{in a split second}} directly from the brain.|$|E

5|$|Pilot whales {{have also}} {{fallen victim to}} bycatches. In one year, around 30 short-finned pilot whales were caught by <b>the</b> <b>squid</b> round-haul fishery in {{southern}} California. Likewise, California's drift gill net fishery took around 20 whales {{a year in the}} mid-1990s. In 1988, 141 whales caught on the east coast of the U.S. were taken by the foreign Atlantic mackerel fishery, which forced it to be shut down.|$|E
5|$|The goblin shark feeds {{mainly on}} teleost fishes such as {{rattails}} and dragonfishes. It also consumes cephalopods and crustaceans, including decapods and isopods. Garbage {{has been recorded}} from the stomachs of some specimens. Its known prey includes bottom-dwelling species such as the blackbelly rosefish (Helicolenus dactylopterus), and midwater species such as <b>the</b> <b>squid</b> Teuthowenia pellucida and the ostracod Macrocypridina castanea rotunda. Thus, the goblin shark appears to forage for food both near the sea floor and far above it.|$|E
5|$|The use of data loggers at {{sea that}} record {{ingestion}} of water against time (providing a likely time of feeding) suggests that albatrosses predominantly feed during the day. Analysis of <b>the</b> <b>squid</b> beaks regurgitated by albatrosses {{has shown that}} many of <b>the</b> <b>squid</b> eaten are too large to have been caught alive, and include mid-water species likely to be {{beyond the reach of}} albatross, suggesting that, for some species (like the wandering albatross), scavenged squid may be {{an important part of the}} diet. The source of these dead squid is a matter of debate; some certainly comes from squid fisheries, but in nature it primarily comes from the die-off that occurs after squid spawning and the vomit of squid-eating whales (sperm whales, pilot whales and southern bottlenose whales). The diet of other species, like the black-browed albatross or the grey-headed albatross, is rich with smaller species of squid that tend to sink after death, and scavenging is not assumed to play a large role in their diet. The waved albatross has been observed practising kleptoparasitism, harassing boobies to steal their food, making it the only member of its order to do so regularly.|$|E

5|$|Jesse Adam Eisenberg (born October 5, 1983) is an American actor, {{author and}} playwright. Born in New York City {{and raised in}} New Jersey, Eisenberg began acting in plays at an early age, and made his {{television}} debut with the short-lived comedy-drama series Get Real (1999–2000). Following his first {{leading role in the}} comedy-drama film Roger Dodger (2002), he appeared in the drama film The Emperor's Club (2002), the psychological thriller film The Village (2004), the comedy-drama film <b>The</b> <b>Squid</b> and the Whale (2005) and the drama film The Education of Charlie Banks (2007). In 2006, Eisenberg was the recipient of the Vail Film Festival Rising Star Award for his role in The Living Wake.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of the genus Sepioteuthis, bigfin reef squids are easy to {{distinguish}} from other squids in that they possess thick and muscular oval fins that extend around almost the entire mantle. The fins extend about 83 to 97% of the mantle length and are 67 to 70% of the mantle length in width. Because of these fins, bigfin reef squids are sometimes mistaken for cuttlefish, a fact reflected by their scientific names. A narrow blue or white line is visible at the point of attachment of the fins to the mantle. A fleshy ridge is also present where the fins meet at the back of <b>the</b> <b>squid.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{angelshark}} is {{an ambush}} predator that feeds mainly on bottom-dwelling bony fishes, especially flatfishes, though it also preys on skates and invertebrates. Prey reported taken include the hake Merluccius merluccius, the bream Pagellus erythrinus, grunts in the genus Pomadasys, the flatfishes Bothus spp., Citharus linguatula, and Solea solea, <b>the</b> <b>squid</b> Loligo vulgaris, the cuttlefishes Sepia officinalis and Sepiola spp., and the crabs Medorippe lanata, Geryon trispinosus, Dromia personata, Goneplax rhomboides, Liocarcinus corrugatus, and Atelecyclus rotundatus. The stomachs of some examined specimens have also contained seagrass or birds (in one case an entire cormorant). Individual sharks select sites that {{offer the best}} ambush opportunities, and if successful, may remain there for several days.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Eisenberg {{appeared}} in Cursed, a horror film directed by Wes Craven, and <b>The</b> <b>Squid</b> and the Whale, a well-reviewed independent drama starring Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels. In 2007, he starred opposite Richard Gere and Terrence Howard in The Hunting Party, a comic thriller {{in which he}} plays an American journalist reporting from Bosnia. In 2009, Eisenberg played the lead role Adventureland, a comedy directed by Greg Mottola and filmed in Kennywood Park, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Filming wrapped in October 2007, and the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2009. In November 2007, Eisenberg was cast in the indie comic-drama Holy Rollers alongside his sister, Hallie Eisenberg, who played his fictional sister in the film. He played a young Hasidic Jew who becomes involved in the ecstasy smuggling trade, using his religion as a disguise to deal without suspicion. Filming took place in New York in 2008. During the late 2000s, he also had roles in the independent films Solitary Man, playing college student Daniel, and Camp Hell, a horror film directed by George Van Buskirk.|$|E
5|$|This {{catch-all}} category {{refers to}} other seabird strategies that involve the next trophic level up. Kleptoparasites are seabirds {{that make a}} part of their living stealing food of other seabirds. Most famously, frigatebirds and skuas engage in this behaviour, although gulls, terns and other species will steal food opportunistically. The nocturnal nesting behaviour of some seabirds has been interpreted as arising due to pressure from this aerial piracy. Kleptoparasitism is not thought to play {{a significant part of the}} diet of any species, and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting. A study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds could at most obtain 40% of the food they needed, and on average obtained only 5%. Many species of gull will feed on seabird and sea mammal carrion when the opportunity arises, as will giant petrels. Some species of albatross also engage in scavenging: an analysis of regurgitated squid beaks has shown that many of <b>the</b> <b>squid</b> eaten are too large to have been caught alive, and include mid-water species likely to be beyond the reach of albatrosses. Some species will also feed on other seabirds; for example, gulls, skuas and pelicans will often take eggs, chicks and even small adult seabirds from nesting colonies, while the giant petrels can kill prey up to the size of small penguins and seal pups.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{designed}} a digital double relaxation oscillation SQUID (DROS) with an single flux quantum (SFQ) feedback circuit for digital <b>SQUID</b> magnetometers. <b>The</b> DROS is magneticall coupled to a feedback SQUID loop and a signal magnetic flux is input to <b>the</b> feedback <b>SQUID</b> loop. <b>The</b> DROS generates {{two kinds of}} voltage pulses corresponding to the total magnetic flux in <b>the</b> feedback <b>SQUID</b> loop. Those voltage pulses are converted to SFQ and anti-SFQ pulses and input to <b>the</b> feedback <b>SQUID</b> loop to keep the magnetic flux in <b>the</b> feedback <b>SQUID</b> loop constant. A read-out dc SQUID (R/O SQUID) is also magnetically coupled to <b>the</b> feedback <b>SQUID</b> loop for monitoring the actual magnetic flux in <b>the</b> feedback <b>SQUID</b> loop. <b>The</b> number of the generated SFQ pulses is estimated by SFQ feedback steps on output voltage curves generated from <b>the</b> R/O <b>SQUID.</b> Wide dynamic operation range is realized by the SFQ feedback and sub-Φ 0 magnetic flux resolution is realized by <b>the</b> R/O <b>SQUID,</b> where Φ 0 (= h/ 2 e) is the single magnetic flux quantum.
