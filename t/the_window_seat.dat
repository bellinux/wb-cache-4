5|$|Manchester has {{a notable}} {{place in the}} history of Marxism and left-wing politics; being the subject of Friedrich Engels' work The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844; Engels spent much of his life in and around Manchester, and when Karl Marx visited Manchester, they met at Chetham's Library. The {{economics}} books Marx was reading at the time {{can be seen in the}} library, as can <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>seat</b> where Marx and Engels would meet. The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to 6 June 1868. Manchester was an important cradle of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board {{concluded}} that the severity of Frank's injuries and the numerous particulates found embedded in his body could only be attributed to his proximity to an explosion. Furthermore, the chemical compounds detected {{in the area around}} the explosion's point of origin were consistent with those generated by a dynamite explosion. The manganese dioxide samples collected from the seats near the focal point and from Frank's body indicated that a dry cell battery was located very near to the explosive. The CAB determined that, based on the blast pattern, a dynamite charge had been placed underneath <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>seat</b> of row 7.|$|E
60|$|She {{slipped into}} Patty's Place {{in the dusk}} and escaped to her room. But Phil was there on <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
60|$|A small object {{attracted}} my attention, crouched {{up on one}} of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>seats.</b> <b>The</b> small object was--Jicks.|$|R
50|$|After Bradley's {{addition}} to <b>the</b> lineup, <b>Window</b> <b>Seats</b> began self-producing new single releases {{and a number}} of music videos.|$|R
60|$|And {{you must}} not imagine this dustless, spotless, sweet {{apartment}} as anything but beautiful. Its appearance is a little unfamiliar of course, but all the muddle of dust-collecting hangings and witless ornament that cover the earthly bedroom, the valances, the curtains to check the draught from <b>the</b> ill-fitting wood <b>windows,</b> <b>the</b> worthless irrelevant pictures, usually a little askew, the dusty carpets, and all the paraphernalia about the dirty, black-leaded fireplace are gone. But the faintly tinted walls are framed with just one clear coloured line, as finely placed as the member of a Greek capital; the door handles and {{the lines of the}} panels of the door, the two chairs, the framework of the bed, the writing table, have all that final simplicity, that exquisite finish of contour that is begotten of sustained artistic effort. <b>The</b> graciously shaped <b>windows</b> each frame a picture--since they are draughtless <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>seats</b> are no mere mockeries as are <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>seats</b> of earth--and on the sill, the sole thing to need attention in the room, is one little bowl of blue Alpine flowers.|$|R
60|$|So the ladies, in full state dresses, {{hovered over}} the fire, while the {{children}} played in <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>seat</b> near at hand.|$|E
60|$|We {{went back}} home, {{deciding}} {{to say nothing}} to the women. They were sitting in <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>seat</b> watching for us, mother and Alice and Lettie.|$|E
6000|$|SEELCHEN sits gazing {{through the}} window at the peaks bathed in [...] full moonlight. Then, drawing the {{blankets}} about her, she [...] snuggles doom on <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
60|$|For {{answer the}} girl {{buried her face}} in her hands and dropped upon <b>the</b> {{cushioned}} <b>window</b> <b>seat</b> before her. <b>The</b> American came close and knelt at her side.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, {{put down}} your pack, {{and let me}} see," [...] said Mrs. Glegg, drawing a chair to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and <b>seating</b> herself with much dignity.|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{heavy-duty}} highway tractors {{frequently have}} {{an option for}} power window controls; however, these are generally what {{is referred to as}} [...] "straight air". That is, the compressed air system used for air brakes is also used for <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b> These types of trucks have long used compressed air cylinders for seat height adjustment. In a similar fashion to the electro-hydraulic system, the compressed air is merely released to lower <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and/or <b>seat.</b> <b>The</b> compressed air is then admitted to the respective cylinder to raise <b>the</b> <b>window</b> or <b>seat.</b>|$|R
60|$|Down the {{corridor}} behind them a tall figure approached on silent, noiseless feet. At {{sight of the}} two at <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>seat</b> it halted. It was the king.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not quite}} encouraging, but Agatha really wished to hear, and she {{advanced}} a wicker chair for her elder sister, {{and sat down on}} <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
60|$|There was Jack--in {{the nursery}} phrase, {{as good as}} gold--still in his place on <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>seat,</b> devoted to his keys. His first words related entirely to himself.|$|E
5000|$|The 600's complex [...] {{hydraulic}} pressure system powered <b>the</b> automobile's <b>windows,</b> <b>seats,</b> sun-roof, boot lid, and automatically closing doors. Adjustable air suspension delivered excellent ride quality and sure handling over any road surface.|$|R
50|$|This is NTU’s {{flagship}} {{library building}} {{and was named}} in recognition for a generous donation by {{the family of the}} late Mr Lee Wee Nam. It houses the Engineering and Science collections and the Library administration. This well photographed building has reading space to cater for both group discussion and learning as well as individual quiet reading. <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>seats,</b> in particular at Level 5, overlook the green campus surroundings and have an excellent view of Jurong West and even parts of the Straits of Johor.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Traveller {{looked about}} him for {{something}} to sit on, and, observing a billet of wood in a corner, brought it near <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> Deliberately <b>seating</b> himself upon it, he answered, [...] "Just so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What is {{his full}} name, {{and what is}} he like?" [...] asked Helen, bending forward a little. The old woman, {{reaching}} over, lifted a faded photograph from <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... [Vivie shuts {{it with a}} slam, and then, noting {{with disgust}} that her mother's hat and shawl are lying about, takes them tidily to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>seat,</b> whilst Frank noiselessly shuts the cottage door.] ...|$|E
60|$|The {{two girls}} sat in <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>seat,</b> {{looking out at}} the lights and the stream of hurrying {{vehicles}} in the avenue. The younger one cuddled down with her head in her sister's lap.|$|E
50|$|In First and Business class cabins, the <b>seat</b> {{letters for}} <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>seats</b> will {{typically}} {{be the same}} as in coach, with some letters skipped in between as there are fewer seats per row. For example, if economy cabin is ten across, labeled ABC-DEFG-HJK, the Business Class cabin might be labeled AC-DG-HK for a six across layout, with A-DG-K for a four across First Class. One notable exception to this is Delta Air Lines, who uses sequential letters regardless of cabin layout on all aircraft (AB-CD-EF in Business Class and ABC-DEF-GHJ in Economy).|$|R
6000|$|... 'And am I then a baron--a lord?' {{said the}} boy. 'Great lords have books. Were there not some big ones on <b>the</b> hall <b>window</b> <b>seats?</b> Did not Brother Eldred begin {{to teach me}} my letters? I would that I could go on to learn more!' ...|$|R
50|$|When the Canadian National reacquired part of {{the fleet}} in 2009 it {{refurbished}} the cars, replacing <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> carpet, and <b>seat</b> upholstery.|$|R
60|$|Then as the {{blackness}} lifts, {{in the dim}} light of the false dawn filtering through the window of the mountain hut. LAMOND and FELSMAN are seen standing beside SEELCHEN looking down at her asleep on <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{should have}} seen Giglamps when he was after them. He pitched out of the tree, and would have broken his blessed old neck if Arch had not caught him," [...] {{observed}} Steve, as he lounged gracefully in <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{girl was}} quite bewildered by this time. She thoughtlessly turned another leaf, {{and before she}} had time to look twice a gray donkey leaped from the book and {{stumbled}} from <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>seat</b> {{to the floor with}} a great clatter.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, the ScotRail {{sector of}} British Rail began a major {{refurbishment}} programme for 50 of the 25-year-old units. To conform to contemporary {{health and safety}} standards the asbestos insulation was removed. Among the many changes introduced were connecting doors between coaches and {{a new type of}} push button passenger door control, along with all-new interiors and new fluorescent lighting. Most units also received new [...] "hopper-style" [...] <b>windows.</b> <b>The</b> new <b>seating</b> was controversial - it was almost identical to that of the Class 314, albeit with a 2+2 configuration. This allowed for many more standing passengers, but with far fewer seats than previously. The original seating was deep sprung and (arguably) far more comfortable. [...] In addition, the original heating, which was provided by panelled in heaters beneath the seats, was replaced by heaters in longitudinal trunking along the lower bodyside, with the spaces under the new seats opened up. [...] This produced draughts and reduced passenger legroom in <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|R
60|$|Ernestine, a {{small but}} robust blonde of eighteen, sprang from the piano and joined her two comrades in a raid on the {{cushions}} of <b>the</b> deep <b>window</b> <b>seats.</b> Side by side, a cushion in each hand, and with proper distance between them cannily established for the swinging of the cushions, they advanced upon the foe.|$|R
60|$|The rangers, with Yaqui and Thorne, {{stationed}} {{themselves at}} <b>the</b> several <b>windows</b> of <b>the</b> sitting-room. Rifles and smaller arms {{and boxes of}} shells littered <b>the</b> tables and <b>window</b> <b>seats.</b> No small force of besiegers could overcome a resistance such as Belding and his men were capable of making.|$|R
60|$|This {{reminded}} her to turn another page, {{and she had}} scarcely noted that it contained {{the picture of a}} monkey when the animal sprang from the book with a great crumpling of paper and landed upon <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>seat</b> beside her.|$|E
6000|$|He did not turn--it was not, of course, {{his habit}} to notice {{what was not}} {{absolutely}} necessary--but she {{felt that he was}} aware of her. She came to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>seat</b> and sat down. He looked round at that, and said: [...] "Ah!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Jack was silenced at last. He {{retired to}} a corner. When he {{followed}} Mrs. Wagner as usual, on {{her return to}} her duties in the office he struck his favorite place on <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>seat</b> with his clenched fist. [...] "The devil take Frankfort!" [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|LADY BRITOMART [peremptorily] Sit down, all of you. [They sit. Cusins {{crosses to}} <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and <b>seats</b> himself there. Lomax takes a chair. Barbara {{sits at the}} writing table and Sarah on the settee]. I don't in the least {{know what you are}} {{laughing}} at, Adolphus. I am surprised at you, though I expected nothing better from Charles Lomax.|$|R
5000|$|Her {{short stories}} appear in <b>the</b> {{collection}} <b>Window</b> <b>Seat</b> (HarperCollins India, 2009) (3) {{as well as}} in anthologies of short fiction such as the Indo-Australian Fear Factor: Terror Incognito and Only Connect: Short Fiction about Technology and Us from Australia and the Indian Subcontinent (5) (6) edited by Meenakshi Bharat and Sharon Rundle. Her story A Good Riot was shortlisted for The Little Magazine’s new writing award in 2006 ...|$|R
50|$|The main bedroom has {{an early}} pendant light fitting and two early brass wall {{lights in the}} {{north-east}} corner. <b>The</b> bay <b>window</b> contains <b>the</b> original bench <b>window</b> <b>seat</b> and brass <b>window</b> hardware. <b>The</b> second bedroom mirrors this decoration scheme. The enclosed western verandah serves as a third bedroom. Eight-light french doors open onto this space from the main and second bedrooms.|$|R
