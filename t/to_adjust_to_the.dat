5|$|The {{designs of}} most of these flags have been {{modified}} only <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> changes in the official rendering of the national coat of arms. Major modifications included {{a change in the}} stylization of the eagle from Neoclassicist to Baroque in 1927 and the removal of the crown from the eagle's head during the Communist rule from 1944 to 1990. Legal specification for the shades of the national colors has also changed with time. The shade of red was first legally specified as vermilion by a presidential decree of 13 December 1928.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{changes in}} the legal {{specifications}} of the shades of the national colors (see the section below), the basic design of the Polish flag, including the 5:8 ratio, has remained unchanged to this day. The flag with coat of arms was only modified <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{changes in the}} coat of arms itself. Major modifications included {{a change in the}} stylization of the eagle from Classicist to Baroque in 1927 and the removal of the crown from the eagle's head during the Communist rule from 1944 to 1990. In that period, Poland {{was one of the few}} socialist states in the Eastern Bloc (apart from the Flag of Cuba) not to adorn communist symbolism on its flag.|$|E

5|$|Darabont's {{departure}} as showrunner in July 2011 {{during the}} second season came as surprise to many, as it came shortly after the season's premiere {{and a few days}} after that year's Comic-Con, where Darabont helped to promote the show. It was speculated that he was unable <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> schedule of running a television series. However, The Hollywood Reporter reported that AMC had fired him. There had been reported difficulties in the production of the second season, including disputes over planned budget cuts and executive meddling, and it was known that Darabont and AMC had several discussions relating to these factors. However, neither Darabont, AMC, nor the cast nor crew of The Walking Dead spoke about the reasons for his firing.|$|E
5|$|Fast {{participated in}} the Rangers' {{training}} camp that preceded the 2013–14 season, during which he impressed New York's head coach Alain Vigneault, and head European scout Anders Hedberg. Although {{it was his first}} North American professional training camp, Fast made the Rangers roster, partially because the team needed a right-handed shot to replace the injured captain Ryan Callahan. Fast made his NHL debut on October 3 against the Phoenix Coyotes, taking one shot on goal in 10:13 of ice time. Fast played in eight of the Rangers' first 10 games of the season, playing on the fourth line and recording no points and a -5 plus-minus, before returning to the AHL to make room for Carl Hagelin's return from a shoulder injury. Observers said Fast needed <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> smaller North American ice surface, and did not get sufficient minutes to do so quickly enough to remain in the NHL.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, the Browns drafted Brian Sipe, giving Gault {{competition}} for the third quarterback spot, which was noted as a main position battle in training camp for the Browns that season. At the end of training camp, Sipe won the job, and Gault was cut. He {{was picked up by}} the San Diego Chargers in late August. He competed with Wayne Clark for the backup quarterback job for a short time, and did not see any playing time for the Chargers before his release. He also spent time with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League, but did not see any playing time with them. He later noted that he was unable <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> game of Canadian football, as he was unable to throw a spiral due to the football being shorter and fatter.|$|E

5|$|On July 6, Burke {{signed a}} maximum rookie contract—120 {{percent of the}} preset salary scale of $2,032,300—with the Jazz, {{resulting}} in a contract worth in $4,987,320 guaranteed salary for his first two seasons, while the Jazz have team option rights for {{the third and fourth}} years. This cleared the way for Burke to participate in the July 7–12 Orlando Summer League. At point guard, the Jazz had traded Randy Foye and were negotiating with Mo Williams. In the NBA Summer League, Trey Burke shot at 24 percent from the field, including 1–19 on three-point shots, while trying <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pace of the NBA game. He was even benched for a game. Following Burke's Summer League performance, the Jazz signed John Lucas III.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine {{joined the}} Spurs for the 2002–03 NBA season, {{where he played}} backup for veteran guard Steve Smith.

As his injury improved, so did Ginóbili, winning the Western Conference Rookie of the Month in March, and being named to the All-Rookie Second Team {{at the end of the}} season. Still, he only started in five games as the Spurs chalked up a 60–22 regular season win–loss record. The Spurs then entered the playoffs eager to upend the {{defending}} champions Los Angeles Lakers, at which point Ginóbili rose to prominence.|$|E
5|$|This {{is one of}} {{the last}} episodes of The Walking Dead to feature Darabont as an {{executive}} producer and the showrunner. In July2011 he stepped down as showrunner. Initial reports suggested that he was unable <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> schedule of running a television series, but it was later confirmed that he was fired because of the show's reduced budget and his strained relationship with the executives of AMC. In addition to the main cast, Melissa McBride reprised her role as Carol Peletier, IronE Singleton reprised his role as T-Dog, and Madison Lintz reprised her role as Sophia Peletier. All three were promoted to the recurring cast, as was Norman Reedus.|$|E

30|$|Coverage and {{capacity}} optimization (CCO) {{is one of}} the typical operational tasks of SON [2, 8]. CCO allows <b>the</b> system <b>to</b> periodically <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> changes in traffic (i.e., load and location) and the radio environment by adjusting the key radio frequency (RF) parameters (e.g., antenna configuration and power) through intelligent algorithms. For the online CCO problem, there is no definite mapping function from the inputs and parameters <b>to</b> be <b>adjusted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coverage {{and capacity}} performance. The main reason is the complexity of adjusting all the configuration parameters affecting both coverage and capacity. In addition, the configuration parameter space is too large, which prohibits exhaustive search [9]. Thereby, most algorithms are designed in a heuristic way.|$|R

Pam and Ryan bicker over who is responsible for making copies until Michael separates them into corners. Pam, who joined the company as a saleswoman, is given the corner where the photocopier sits. She is concerned that Michael will force her to be the receptionist, which is why she quit Dunder Mifflin in the first place. She goes upstairs and asks Charles Miner (Idris Elba) for her job back, but Charles has already given the job to a new employee, Kelly Hannon (Ellie Kemper), who ends up going by her middle name—Erin—to avoid confusion with Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling).|$|E

However, when World War II broke in 1939, Newcastle {{had a chance to}} regroup, and in the War period, they brought in Jackie Milburn, Tommy Walker and Bobby Cowell. They were finally promoted back to the First Division {{at the end of the}} 1947–48 season. During the 1950s, Newcastle won the FA Cup trophy on three occasions within a five-year period, beating Blackpool in 1951, Arsenal in 1952, and Manchester City in 1955. However, after this last FA Cup victory the club fell back into decline and were relegated to the Second Division once again at the end of the 1960–61 season under the management of Charlie Mitten. Mitten left after one season in the Second Division and was replaced by former player Joe Harvey. Newcastle returned to the First Division at the end of the 1964–65 season after winning the Second Division title. Under Harvey, the club qualified for European competition for the first time after a good run in the 1967–68 season and the following year won the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final, triumphing 6–2 over two legs against Hungary's Újpest in the final.|$|E

After an attack by a rival group, the Lazuli, the Whiskers are forced to {{surrender}} their territory and move to a new home. A hawk kills Holly when Flower is a year old, and her father abandons the group to find a new mate. Flower's sister Viale becomes the group's matriarch and chooses Youssarian, a roving male from the Lazuli, as her mate. Flower mates with Yossarian's brother, Zaphod, but Viale kills the resulting pups and banishes Flower from the group, allowing her to return later. During a time of starvation and drought, Viale attempts to lead the group across a road to forage. As she crosses, she is struck and killed by a passing truck. As the Whiskers attempt <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> loss of their leader, a snake approaches the group. Flower steps in to lead an attack to drive it off.
