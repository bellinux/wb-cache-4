5|$|The series earned {{relatively}} average {{ratings for}} GSN's standards. Despite The American Bible Challenge debuting to record ratings for GSN, Beat <b>the</b> <b>Chefs</b> maintained {{less than a}} third of the viewers that tuned in to its lead-in. The series premiere averaged 521,000 viewers, compared to the 1.73 million viewers who watched The American Bible Challenge. The following week, Beat <b>the</b> <b>Chefs</b> dropped to 357,000 viewers, while its lead-out, a sneak peek of GSN's upcoming revival of Pyramid, earned 443,000 viewers.|$|E
5|$|The series {{features}} two families, {{one in each}} {{half-hour of}} the episode, preparing their family recipe while the professional chefs cook a restaurant {{version of the same}} meal. The family begins by revealing the dish they have selected to cook to <b>the</b> <b>chefs</b> as well as how longer they think it will take to prepare it. <b>The</b> <b>chefs</b> are then given {{the same amount of time}} to create their own version. Once the first cook-off is complete, the second family is brought out, and the procedure is repeated with their own meal. After the second cook-off, the judges reveal the winning dish from each round. If the family's home cooked meal beats the chefs' professional version, the family wins $25,000; if <b>the</b> <b>chefs</b> win, the family receives $1,000 worth of kitchen supplies.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>chefs</b> were {{initially}} {{surprised at how}} busy they were at lunchtimes; Harveys had been based next to Wandsworth Common and so the typically slow lunch service was used to give <b>the</b> <b>chefs</b> a break. Now based near Hyde Park, they had {{four or five times}} the number of covers for a lunch service than before. White remained determined to gain his third Michelin star, and to achieve this, he sought to emulate and surpass the food and service at Pierre Koffman's three Michelin star restaurant La Tante Claire. White worked 14/15 hour days for six days a week, expecting similar hours from those chefs under him, with the restaurant only closed on Sundays.|$|E
50|$|If {{the wheel}} lands on BUST, <b>the</b> <b>chef</b> forfeits their {{winnings}} and leaves with nothing. On PUSH, <b>the</b> <b>chef</b> earns no additional money and leaves with their original winnings. Landing on any ADD $XXXX space adds that amount to their winnings. The ? Space adds a mystery amount to <b>the</b> <b>chef's</b> winnings, {{up to an}} additional $10,000. A DOUBLE space doubles the winnings of <b>the</b> <b>chef,</b> and <b>the</b> JACKPOT space triples <b>the</b> <b>chef's</b> winnings, up to a possible top winnings of $30,000. SPIN AGAIN forces <b>the</b> <b>chef</b> to re-spin <b>the</b> wheel.|$|R

5|$|Beat <b>the</b> <b>Chefs</b> is an American {{television}} cooking {{game show}} broadcast by Game Show Network (GSN) and hosted by Matt Rogers. The series features contestants preparing a home-cooked family recipe, while professional chefs Beau MacMillan, Antonia Lofaso and Jeff Henderson {{make the same}} recipe in an upscale restaurant version. The two dishes are then judged {{by a panel of}} food critics, who decide the winner. The series premiered on August 23, 2012, and aired its last episode on September 13, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) confides in Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{that she}} is {{intending}} to stay in Tallahassee. Ryan interprets this as an invitation {{to hook up with}} her, so he attempts to seduce her by taking her to the empty kitchen to help her make a waffle. They hide under a table when <b>the</b> <b>chefs</b> return. After Ryan compliments Erin, she suggests that they could become roommates in Florida and possibly start dating in six months if things go well between them. Not wanting that long timeline, he resorts to saying he loves Kelly.|$|E
5|$|After {{these changes}} were made, the test {{audience}} became more {{appreciative of the}} series, and GSN announced its development {{to the public at}} an upfront presentation in New York City on March 21, 2012 for the network's upcoming programming. By this time, a pilot episode had already been shot with American stand-up comedian and television personality Jeff Foxworthy performing the hosting duties for the show. When first asked if he was interested in hosting the show, Foxworthy was hesitant; he agreed to take on the role after learning that contestants would be playing for charity rather than on their own behalf. Casting for the series was held in various cities from May to June 2012. On July 7, 2012, GSN confirmed the show would premiere on August 23, 2012, alongside the premiere of Beat <b>the</b> <b>Chefs.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Another example {{familiar}} to law students {{is that of}} the restaurant owner who stores rat poison above the grill in his luncheonette. The story is that during the lunch rush, the can explodes, severely injuring <b>the</b> <b>chef</b> who is preparing food in <b>the</b> kitchen. <b>The</b> <b>chef</b> sues <b>the</b> owner for negligence. <b>The</b> <b>chef</b> may not recover. Storing rat poison above the grill was negligent because it involved the risk that <b>the</b> <b>chef</b> might inadvertently mistake it for a spice and use it as an ingredient in a recipe. The explosion of the container and subsequent injury to <b>the</b> <b>chef</b> was not what made the chosen storage space risky.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Chef</b> is {{referred}} to by name in one episode, in which Danny Kaye plays his uncle. Kaye reels off a very long name but adds, [...] "But we call him Tom" [...] - much to <b>the</b> <b>Chef's</b> amusement. In 2010, <b>the</b> <b>Chef</b> was seen wearing a wedding ring, implying that the character is married.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>chef</b> {{tries to}} kill Octodad and swings his meat cleaver and strikes the {{mannequin}} Octodad fashioned earlier. He realises {{he has been}} fooled {{but it is too}} late and Octodad's children appear. <b>The</b> <b>chef</b> claims that Octodad is not human but the children take no notice and are on Octodad's side. <b>The</b> <b>chef</b> is forcefully removed from the house by a barrage of toys. Now standing on the street in the light of a street lamp, <b>the</b> <b>chef</b> announces his revenge upon Octodad and his family and disappears using his 'Smoke bomb'.|$|R
5|$|As Remy watches {{through the}} window, {{a young man}} named Alfredo Linguini is hired as a garbage boy by Skinner, the restaurant's {{paranoid}} current owner and Gusteau's former sous-chef. When Linguini spills a pot of soup and attempts to recreate it, Remy recognizes that he is ruining it instead, and repairs Linguini's mistakes. Linguini catches Remy but hides him when he is then confronted by Skinner for tampering with the soup. As the two argue, the soup is accidentally served and proves to be a success. <b>The</b> <b>Chefs</b> convince Skinner to retain Linguini, who is assumed to be the soup's creator. When Skinner catches Remy trying to escape, he orders Linguini to kill the rat, but Linguini discovers Remy's intelligence and decides to keep him instead.|$|E
5|$|Food {{selection}} at {{the restaurant}} comes from the traditional cuisine of the United States. Popcorn is served as a free hors d'oeuvre. Other food items include milkshakes, hot fudge sundaes, seafood salad, turkey sloppy joes, fried pickles, St. Louis-style barbecue ribs, beef-and-blue-cheese salads, saut√©ed shrimp with farfalle, French fries, cucumber salads, Buffalo wings, Boca Burgers, Tofutti, and steaks. Drinks include souvenir phosphorescent ice cubes. The desserts are served in larger portions than are customary elsewhere. There are vegetarian options. <b>The</b> <b>chefs</b> at the Sci-Fi Dine-In sometimes cater for special requests in advance. The cookbook Delicious Disney Just for Kids contains a recipe for the BLT soup served at the Sci-Fi Dine-In.|$|E
5|$|In late 2007 the {{restaurant}} {{moved to a}} modern building custom-built for {{the restaurant}} about 100 meters from the prior location, with the original location still being used for staff meals. The new layout features wooden floors, with simply dressed tables. On each table sits three stones to signify the three Roca brothers, while the tableware is Rosenthal china. The enlarged kitchen in the new location includes space for thirty chefs to work and also features Joan Roca's open plan office, {{so that he can}} keep an eye on <b>the</b> <b>chefs</b> even while he is doing more administrative tasks. At least one of the three brothers is present for every service. There is a capacity for 45 diners.|$|E
50|$|The pair {{get ready}} to start work in the kitchen where Stan tells <b>the</b> <b>chef</b> (who is busy cooking) not to wear his hat. Stan takes it off him several times but <b>the</b> <b>chef</b> {{proceeds}} to keep putting it back on. Stan soon loses his cool and throws <b>the</b> <b>chef's</b> hat away. <b>The</b> <b>chef</b> retaliates by grabbing the nearest plate and smashing it over Stan's head. Stan does the same back to <b>the</b> <b>chef</b> and they carry on using plates as weapons until Ollie calms things down by stopping Stan from destroying a large, expensive looking plate. However, as Ollie walks off, he trips {{on the kitchen floor}} and smashes the plate, causing him to be embarrassed by the onlooking maid.|$|R

5|$|The book's author, Jayne Rockmill, is a {{literary}} agent based in New York City whose clients include Tony Caputo, Fran√ßois Halard, {{and the professional}} photographer and storm chaser, Jim Reed. Rockmill had also become involved in producing charity food and wine events, and is a longtime supporter of the New York City Food Bank and Share Our Strength, which focuses on ending childhood hunger. She conceived the book {{as a way to}} help raise money for their work, and a portion of the proceeds from I Love Bacon will be donated to the two charities. Rockmill began by asking chefs she knew personally to donate bacon recipes, and then contacted others across the United States. In some cases, she adapted the original recipes in collaboration with <b>the</b> <b>chefs.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Restaurant was {{the first}} time White had a kitchen staff {{organised}} into traditional brigades such as he had worked in while at Albert Roux's Le Gavroche. At Harveys, White had eight chefs under him on average, which was expanded to a team of about 20 at The Restaurant. Five of <b>the</b> <b>chefs</b> moved from Harveys to The Restaurant with him, while another former Harveys chef joined them among several others who joined from other Michelin starred restaurants from the UK and France. This enabled White to adopt a structure with himself, a head chef, a team of four or five sous chefs and teams on fish, meat/sauce, larder and pastry. Each of those sections was then broken down into a chef de partie heading the team, and then commis chefs under them. By 1994, √âric Chavot had joined the brigade as head chef under White. He left the following year with White's assistance to open the restaurant Interlude de Chavot.|$|E
25|$|The {{first game}} was held Thanksgiving Day in 1933, an {{exhibition}} contest against the Rochester Arpeakos. A crowd of 10,000 attended {{the game to}} watch Conacher play his first competitive football game in Canada in ten years. He did not disappoint, scoring two touchdowns and setting up a third for <b>the</b> <b>Chefs,</b> and was hailed as the game's star despite an 18‚Äì15 loss. Toronto lost a return match in Rochester, but {{in the third and}} final game of their season, <b>the</b> <b>Chefs</b> defeated a team from Buffalo at Toronto by a score of 18‚Äì0. Conacher was again the star, rushing for two touchdowns and scoring 13 of his team's points. He organized the team for a second year in 1934, known as the Wrigley Aromints due to new sponsorship, and again played an exhibition schedule as the team remained unaffiliated with any league. The team again played three games, winning all three. However, at the age of 34 years, Conacher found that the game was too hard on his body physically, and neither he nor his team returned for a third season.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} types of foods in the Philippines because of its residents. Most of the Chinese Filipinos have {{businesses}} involving Chinese cuisine. Restaurants are frequently seen {{where there is a}} large number of Chinese Filipino residents. The food is usually Cantonese because <b>the</b> <b>chefs</b> are from Hong Kong. Typically the Chinese name of a particular food is given a Filipino name or close equivalent in name to simplify its pronunciation.|$|E
25|$|During the 1920s, {{as there}} were tough {{competitions}} between department stores in attracting more customers, the chef of each department store would invent a new dim sum or dessert weekly (ÊØèÈÄ±ÁæéÈªû) as an attraction, {{and that was when}} egg tarts first appeared in Guangzhou. Later in the 1940s and 1950s, lots of <b>the</b> <b>chefs</b> have migrated to Hong Kong and thus brought the recipes with them. Hence, a Hong Kong style of egg tarts had emerged.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. UPN network {{presented}} two one-hour {{episodes of}} Iron Chef USA hosted by William Shatner around Christmas 2001. These shows were neither a critical nor popular success, {{perhaps because the}} show focused little on cookinga {{major part of the}} Japanese programme. The show had a small audience section with bleachers, and the audience yelled relentlessly during the show (sounding much like a sports audience). Shatner walked around the kitchen sampling the more expensive items, <b>the</b> <b>chefs</b> refused to say what they were doing, and the cameras rarely showed the food preparation.|$|E

25|$|The {{show was}} {{presented}} in the United States and Canada on the Food Network, dubbed and/or subtitled into English. It is also actively broadcast on SBS TV in Australia. In the case of SBS this is unusual as the network has a policy favouring in-house subtitling. It may be felt that the tone given to the show by its American dub is essential to its charms, heightened perhaps {{by the fact that}} in most episodes, the flamboyant Chairman is subtitled instead of dubbed. However, episodes aired since February 2009 have seen the Chairman's voice dubbed rather than subtitled {{as was the case in}} previous airings, except when he sends <b>the</b> <b>chefs</b> into battle.|$|E

500|$|The first {{characteristic}} was {{a rejection}} of excessive complication in cooking. Second, the cooking times for most fish, seafood, game birds, veal, green vegetables and p√¢t√©s was greatly reduced {{in an attempt to}} preserve the natural flavors. Steaming was an important trend from this characteristic. The third characteristic was that the cuisine was made with the freshest possible ingredients. Fourth, large menus were abandoned in favor of shorter menus. Fifth, strong marinades for meat and game ceased to be used. Sixth, they stopped using heavy sauces such as espagnole and b√©chamel thickened with flour based [...] "roux", in favor of seasoning their dishes with fresh herbs, quality butter, lemon juice, and vinegar. Seventh, they used regional dishes for inspiration instead of haute cuisine dishes. Eighth, new techniques were embraced and modern equipment was often used; Bocuse even used microwave ovens. Ninth, <b>the</b> <b>chefs</b> paid close attention to the dietary needs of their guests through their dishes. Tenth and finally, <b>the</b> <b>chefs</b> were extremely inventive and created new combinations and pairings.|$|E
