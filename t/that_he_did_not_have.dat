Instead of using it purely {{to explain the}} democratic process, the campaign was used to extol Diệm and his allies. After explaining what democracy was, a pamphlet outlined why Deposing a chief-of-state is a vital act. After elaborating on {{the powers of the}} head of state, the pamphlet went on to champion Diệm as an anti-communist who could defend people's freedom, while explaining why Bảo Đại was unfit to lead, saying <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> respect among the international community.|$|E

A bag matching the description was later found in a nearby desert area containing 9mm ammunition, and it is believed to belong to Loughner.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} Sidel’s {{criticism of}} certain Kerschensteiner’s views about work-school and work-education. Sidel disputed that Kerschensteiner was {{the creator of}} the idea about work-school, emphasizing that, significantly before Kerschensteiner, he put forth this idea in his papers, in which he proved the pedagogical value of work and the need for work-school. Sidel objects to Kerschensteiner <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> convincingly elaborate the need for introducing work-school, that, when explaining the need for handcraft, he underestimated the significance of books for education and culture in general, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> specify the term "giftedness", <b>that</b> is, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> indicate <b>that</b> besides spiritual, there are other kinds of giftedness and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> understand correctly the relation between work and obviousness. Sidel also thinks that Kerschensteiner <b>did</b> <b>not</b> understand the relation between the society, state and education, i. e. <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> demonstrate <b>that</b> school reform is conditioned by social reasons, that work-school is a social an political need, that work education is the need and interest of modern society and state. Also, he objects to Kerschensteiner <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> understand nor emphasize the significance and value of handcraft for artistic education, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> speak about the role of work in the development of inventive spirit of the young, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> sufficiently emphasize <b>that</b> significance of handcraft for the development of will, moral and character, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> speak in which way work-school can be realized, i. e. <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> see the mutual relationship between social development and school and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> demand any social changes for the purpose of accomplishing that goal. Sidel concludes that Kerschensteiner’s work-school, introduced in the conditions of monarchist organization of schools in Germany, cannot be a role model which should be followed...|$|R

Larson left about $50,000 in his house, which was stolen in a burglary while he was attending a Christmas party. The case remains unsolved to this day.|$|E

5|$|General Grant had Commander Henry Walke {{bring the}} Carondelet up the Cumberland River {{to create a}} {{diversion}} by opening fire on the fort. The Confederates responded with shots from their long-range guns and eventually hit the gunboat. Walke retreated several miles below the fort, but soon returned and continued shelling the water batteries. General McClernand, in the meantime, had been attempting to stretch his men toward the river but ran into difficulties with a Confederate battery of guns. McClernand ultimately decided <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> enough men to stretch {{all the way to}} the river, so Grant decided to call on more troops. He sent orders to General Wallace, who had been left behind at Fort Henry, to bring his men to Fort Donelson.|$|E

5|$|The {{charges against}} Galle were dropped before her case went to trial. Mitchell's case was tried by county {{attorney}} Scott Tidwell, a political supporter of Roberts {{and the personal}} attorney for Arafiles, in February 2010. Both the TMB executive director and the county attorney in nearby Andrews County discouraged Tidwell from trying the case. At trial, Mitchell did not testify. The relationship between Arafiles and Roberts was explored during the proceedings. Arafiles introduced Roberts to a supplement-selling program known as Zrii, and recommended the supplements to his patients. Roberts sold the supplements, {{but he said that}} his friendship with Arafiles had not impacted his actions with the nurses and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a business relationship with Arafiles.|$|E
5|$|Bill Werde {{was named}} {{editorial}} director in 2008, and {{was followed by}} Janice Min in January 2014, who is also responsible for editorial content at The Hollywood Reporter. The magazine has since been making changes {{to make it more}} of a general interest music news source, as opposed to solely an industry trade. It started covering more celebrity, fashion, and gossip. Min hired Tony Gervino as the publication's editor, which was different than Billboard's historical appointments, in <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a background in the music industry. Tony Gervino was appointed editor-in-chief in April 2014. An item on NPR covered a leaked version of Billboards annual survey, which it said had more gossip and focused on less professional topics than prior surveys. For example, it polled readers on a lawsuit pop-star Kesha filed against her producer alleging sexual abuse.|$|E
5|$|Bradstreet set {{out from}} Fort Schlosser in early August 1764 with about 1,200 {{soldiers}} and a large contingent of Native allies enlisted by Sir William Johnson. Bradstreet felt <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> enough troops to subdue enemy Native Americans by force, and so when strong winds on Lake Erie forced him to stop at Presque Isle on August 12, he decided to negotiate a treaty with a delegation of Ohio Native Americans led by Guyasuta. Bradstreet exceeded his authority by conducting a peace treaty rather than a simple truce, and by agreeing to halt Bouquet's expedition, which had not yet left Fort Pitt. Gage, Johnson, and Bouquet were outraged when they learned what Bradstreet had done. Gage rejected the treaty, believing that Bradstreet had been duped into abandoning his offensive in the Ohio Country. Gage may have been correct: the Ohio Native Americans did not return prisoners as promised in a second meeting with Bradstreet in September, and some Shawnees were trying to enlist French aid {{in order to continue}} the war.|$|E

5|$|Browne was {{regarded}} as an intelligent and meticulous athlete, who was known for a logical and somewhat introspective style in his approach to the sport. He felt <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the raw speed to match the likes of Lionel Cox and Dick Ploog in vying for selection in Australia's sprint team, {{and that he was}} not suited to long road races, instead focusing on medium length track racing. Browne typically was the front rider in tandem races, liking to be in control. He {{was regarded}} to be a cyclist who behaved in a careful and scholarly manner, and was known for coaxing higher levels of performance out of his younger partners. Browne was respected for his technical knowledge of the tandem and his success was often attributed to his vast experience.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Potts was poorly {{received}} by critics. Etty's admirers were angered by his apparent abandonment of history painting for the then poorly regarded field of portrait painting, while Etty's critics {{felt he had}} demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the technical skills to produce high quality portraits, and was simply trying to use his name {{to make money in}} the more lucrative field of portraiture. History paintings were generally sold at exhibition for no less than the asking price, and as a consequence often remained unsold. Portraits were commissioned by the subject or their family, providing a guaranteed source of income to the artist. History painting was much more highly regarded as an art form; portrait painting was seen as reflecting nature whereas history painting involved more creativity and also gave the artist the opportunity to tell moral lessons.|$|E
5|$|Gupte {{described}} his character as mercurial, and found playing him a physical delight.

Chandan Roy Sanyal {{described his}} character Mikhail as provocative, mad, wicked and humorous. Subramnayam and Joshi, who played Lobo and Lele respectively, described their characters as the most corrupt policemen in their department at the Anti-Narcotics Bureau. They said that {{to prepare for the}} roles they followed the script and Bhardwaj's instructions to get the characters right. Mukherjee prepared for his role as Mujeeb by reading the script and understanding the characters, and discussing it with Bhardwaj. Dutta, who played Shumona Bengali criminal involved in fixing horse races and arms dealingsaid <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> much time to prepare for his role because he was given the script after he arrived in Mumbai, where Bhardwaj briefed him.|$|E

Greene wrote <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a command for Scott, however, and requested that he remain with Muhlenberg in Virginia.

During the match, Helms attempted to leave, but was blocked by other cruiserweights who threw Helms back into the ring, resulting in Helms losing the match. Helms underwent successful surgery on his nose and was expected to miss five to six weeks. During this time SmackDown! announcers stated that Helms had a no-compete clause in his contract allowing him to waive the thirty-day title defense rule due to any injury. Helms returned to the ring on the April 28 episode of SmackDown!, teaming with MNM to face Super Crazy, London and Kendrick in a six-man tag team match. Helms continued to defend his belt during pay-per-views, but he made more regular appearances on SmackDown!s sister show, Velocity.|$|E
5|$|R. v. Kent Police Authority, {{ex parte}} Godden (1972) is an {{instance}} of a United Kingdom case in which an order of prohibition was issued to avert action {{that would not have}} complied with administrative law rules. In July 1970, Godden, a police chief inspector of Kent Police Authority, was examined by the police authority's chief medical officer, who took the view that he was suffering from a mental disorder and thus unfit for duty. Godden was therefore placed on sick leave, although his own specialist found <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> any psychiatric illness. Subsequently, in January 1971, the police authority informed him that it would be appointing the chief medical officer to assess if he was permanently disabled, for the purpose of determining if he should be compulsorily retired. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales found that since the medical officer had previously formed the opinion that Godden was mentally disordered, he could not be impartial when assessing if Godden was permanently disabled. Thus, an order of prohibition should be issued to prohibit him from carrying out this assessment.|$|E
