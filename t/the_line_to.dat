5|$|In a November 2013 Daily News opinion article, the {{president}} of the Real Estate Board of New York and the chairman of Edison Properties called for <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> be extended to Secaucus in tunnels to be shared with the Gateway Project.

50|$|At Ise-Nakagawa, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> has {{connections}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Osaka <b>Line</b> <b>to</b> Uehommachi and Kintetsu Namba Stations {{of downtown}} Osaka, and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Yamada <b>Line</b> <b>to</b> Ujiyamada Station and beyond Toba Station on <b>the</b> Toba <b>Line</b> and Kashikojima Station of <b>the</b> Shima <b>Line,</b> <b>to</b> provide touristic access to scenic Shima Peninsula and Ise Shrine.|$|R

5|$|The B {{converted}} <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Taunton to mixed gauge by 1 June 1875, but {{the remainder}} of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Exeter was not done until 1 March 1876, {{three months after the}} B had amalgamated with the GWR. The remainder of the lines beyond Exeter were converted to standard gauge on 21 May 1892 so the extra rails at Temple Meads fell into disuse and were removed to leave a purely standard gauge layout. This allowed the through station to be rebuilt with two additional platform faces.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points classification, which awarded a mauve jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for {{finishing}} in the top 15 in a stage. The stage win awarded 25 points, second place awarded 20 points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point less per place down <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> <b>to</b> a single point for 15th. In addition, some points could be won in intermediate sprints.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points classification, which awarded a red jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for {{finishing}} in the top ten in a stage. The stage win awarded 12 points, second place awarded 10 points, third 8, and one point fewer per place down <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> <b>to</b> a single point for tenth. In addition, the first four riders across the intermediate sprint lines earned points, 5, 3, 2, and 1 in succession.|$|E
5|$|An Act was {{obtained}} on 27 July 1857 to extend <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Minehead, with a branch to Cleeve; an additional £35,000 capital was authorised, but this work never started.|$|E
5|$|At Roosevelt Avenue on the IND Queens Boulevard Line, a two-track {{upper level}} {{was built for}} the Winfield Spur towards <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> the Rockaways. Unlike the other stations, this one was completed, except for track.|$|E
5000|$|Consider an {{arbitrary}} triangle ABC with a point P1 on its edge BC. A {{sequence of points}} and parallel lines is constructed as follows. <b>The</b> parallel <b>line</b> <b>to</b> AC through P1 intersects AB in P2 and <b>the</b> parallel <b>line</b> <b>to</b> BC through P2 intersects AC in P3. Continuing in this fashion <b>the</b> parallel <b>line</b> <b>to</b> AB through P3 intersects BC in P4 and <b>the</b> parallel <b>line</b> <b>to</b> AC through P4 intersects AB in P5. Finally <b>the</b> parallel <b>line</b> <b>to</b> BC through P5 intersects AC in P6 and <b>the</b> parallel <b>line</b> <b>to</b> AB through P6 intersects BC in P7.

5|$|Cheadle Hulme's first {{railway station}} opened in 1842, when the Manchester and Birmingham Railway to Crewe was completed. With the {{extension}} of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Macclesfield, and later Stoke-on-Trent, a new station opened in 1845 which has served the area since. The railway transformed it from a collection of small hamlets into a suburb of over 29,000people.|$|E

5000|$|Chino Station: The Saku Railway, {{which had}} built <b>the</b> <b>line</b> from Komoro on <b>the</b> Shinetsu <b>Line</b> <b>to</b> Koumi, {{proposed}} <b>to</b> build a <b>line</b> from Tanaka on <b>the</b> Shinetsu <b>Line</b> <b>to</b> this station. <b>The</b> company was nationalised before construction started, and JGR connected <b>the</b> Koumi <b>line</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chuo Main <b>Line</b> in 1935, making this proposal redundant.|$|R
5|$|In 1850 {{an engine}} shed had been {{opened on the}} south bank of the River Avon {{on the east side}} of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> the B station.

5|$|In 1993, {{proposals}} {{were made to}} re-open <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Tryvandshøiden Station, so that the Tryvann Ski Resort would be more accessible to Oslo residents.

5|$|In 2004, {{the writer}} Erling Fossen {{gathered}} 356 signatures {{in favor of}} extending <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> the ski resort, which {{were given to the}} Oslo City Council.
