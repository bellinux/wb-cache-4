25|$|According to game theory, because {{starting}} {{a nuclear war}} was suicidal, no logical country would shoot first. However, if a country could launch a first strike that utterly destroyed the target country's ability to respond, <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>give</b> that country the confidence to initiate a nuclear war. The object of a country operating by the MAD doctrine is to deny the opposing country this first strike capability.|$|E

Two such cases that reached the federal appeals courts gave rise to such hopes (or fears) with regard to Bronston, but neither made it past that level.|$|E
25|$|An {{earthquake}} precursor is an anomalous phenomenon <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>give</b> effective {{warning of}} an impending earthquake. Reports of these – though generally recognized as such {{only after the}} event – number in the thousands, some dating back to antiquity. There have been around 400 reports of possible precursors in scientific literature, of roughly twenty different types, running the gamut from aeronomy to zoology. None {{have been found to}} be reliable for the purposes of earthquake prediction.|$|E

25|$|Admiral Vernon tested Cartagena de Indias {{on three}} {{separate}} occasions. Both Vernon and Edward Trelawny, British governor of Jamaica, considered the Spanish gold shipping port to be a prime objective. The first attempt, in March 1740, {{was essentially a}} reconnaissance in force by a squadron including ships of the line, two fire ships, three bomb vessels, and transport ships. Vernon's intention was to gather information on topography and troop strength and to provoke a response <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>give</b> him {{a better idea of}} the defensive capabilities of the Spanish.|$|E
25|$|Affine {{transformations of}} the plane are useful for {{studying}} equidissections, including translations, uniform and non-uniform scaling, reflections, rotations, shears, and other similarities and linear maps. Since an affine transformation preserves straight lines and ratios of areas, it sends equidissections to equidissections. This means that one is free to apply any affine transformation to a polygon <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>give</b> it a more manageable form. For example, {{it is common to}} choose coordinates such that three of the vertices of a polygon are (0, 1), (0, 0), and (1, 0).|$|E

In addition, both groups opposed affirmative action programmes <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>give</b> preference to non-Coloured Black people, and some Coloured people feared giving up older privileges, such as access to municipal jobs, if African National Congress gained leadership in the government.|$|E

25|$|Behavioral {{studies have}} {{confirmed}} that sharks can take visual cues in order to discriminate between different objects. The bull shark is able to discriminate between colors of mesh netting that is present underwater. It was found that bull sharks tended to avoid mesh netting of bright colors rather than colors that blended in with the water. Bright yellow mesh netting {{was found to be}} easily avoided when it was placed {{in the path of the}} bull shark. This was found to be the reason that sharks are attracted to bright yellow survival gear rather than ones that were painted black. This is very important because it gives an insight into how bull sharks are able to pick up certain visual keys underwater <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>give</b> them an advantage when seeking out certain prey.|$|E
25|$|On 7 March 1740, in a {{more direct}} approach, Vernon {{undertook}} a reconnaissance-in-force of the Spanish city. Vernon left Port Royal in command of a squadron including ships of the line, two fire ships, three bomb vessels, and transport ships. Reaching Cartagena on 13 March, Vernon immediately landed several men to map the topography and to reconnoitre the Spanish squadron anchored in Playa Grande, west of Cartagena. Having not seen any reaction from the Spanish, on 18 March Vernon ordered the three bomb vessels to open fire on the city. Vernon intended to provoke a response <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>give</b> him {{a better idea of}} the defensive capabilities of the Spanish. Understanding Vernon's motives, Lezo did not immediately respond. Instead, Lezo ordered the removal of guns from some of his ships, in order to form a temporary shore battery for the purpose of suppressive fire. Vernon next initiated an amphibious assault, but in the face of strong resistance, the attempt to land 400 soldiers was unsuccessful. The British then undertook a three-day naval bombardment of the city. In total, the campaign lasted 21 days. Vernon then withdrew his forces, leaving HMS Windsor Castle and HMS Greenwich in the vicinity, with a mission to intercept any Spanish ship that might approach.|$|E

Executive producer Glen Morgan begrudgingly allowed Maher and Reindl to show the ability in this episode, saying [...] "I felt last year those visions were a cheat. The camera {{would go to a}} coffee cup and Frank would say, 'The murderer used a coffee cup.' It drove me nuts. What we were trying to do this year was elevate Frank's visions to a dream-like state, so he would have to interpret what he's seeing.

2500|$|At {{the end of}} September 1974, the Royals {{announced}} that Boros was being elevated to the major league club to replace Charley Lau on the team's coaching staff for the 1975 season. He was the Royals third base coach in 1975 under manager Whitey Herzog. From 1976 to 1979, he was the Royal's first base coach and was [...] "credited with helping the Royals develop an aggressive baserunning style." [...] While Boros was in Kansas City, he began to attract media attention for his [...] "scientific approach" [...] to baseball. In July 1977, the UPI published a feature story about Boros in which it observed:"Boros began putting a book together on all the pitchers and catchers in the American League last year, noting their strengths and weaknesses and any tipoffs <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>give</b> Royal runners an edge on the basepaths. His observations were written into a small 25-cent notepad along with a flock of stopwatch readings that represent {{the time it takes}} a pitcher to throw the ball to home plate out of both the stretch and windup, and how long it takes a catcher to peg the ball to second and third base." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{plan was}} devised to station {{submarines}} offshore from British naval bases, and then stage some action that would draw out the British ships {{to the waiting}} submarines. The battlecruiser [...] had been damaged in a previous engagement, but was due to be repaired by mid May, so an operation was scheduled for 17 May 1916. At the start of May, difficulties with condensers were discovered on ships of the third battleship squadron, so the operation was put back to 23 May. Ten submarines—, , , , , , , , , and —were given orders first to patrol in the central North Sea between 17 and 22 May, and then to take up waiting positions. U-43 and U-44 were stationed in the Pentland Firth, which the Grand Fleet was likely to cross leaving Scapa Flow, while the remainder proceeded to the Firth of Forth, awaiting battlecruisers departing Rosyth. Each boat had an allocated area, within which it could move around as necessary to avoid detection, but was instructed to keep within it. During the initial North Sea patrol the boats were instructed to sail only north–south so that any enemy who chanced to encounter one would believe it was departing or returning from operations {{on the west coast}} (which required them to pass around the north of Britain). Once at their final positions, the boats were under strict orders to avoid premature detection <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>give</b> away the operation. It was arranged that a coded signal would be transmitted to alert the submarines exactly when the operation commenced: [...] "Take into account the enemy's forces may be putting to sea".|$|E
