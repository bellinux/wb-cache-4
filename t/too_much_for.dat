5|$|In 1951, Soedjatmoko {{moved to}} Washington D.C. to {{establish}} the political desk at the Indonesian embassy there; he also became Alternate Permanent Representative of Indonesia at the UN. This busy schedule, demanding a commute between three cities, proved to be <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> him and {{he dropped out of}} the Littauer Center. In late 1951, he resigned from his positions and went to Europe for nine months, seeking political inspiration. In Yugoslavia, he met Milovan Djilas, who impressed him greatly.|$|E

He {{was a first}} Team All-Star, a starter in the NHL All-Star Game, and {{a finalist for the}} Hart Trophy again. The Devils lost the Atlantic Division title by 1 point to the Philadelphia Flyers, who thus obtained the third seed and home ice advantage against the sixth-seeded Devils {{in the first round of}} the playoffs. This would be <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> Brodeur and the Devils to overcome, as the Flyers went on to defeat them in five games.|$|E
5|$|Rupert D'Oyly Carte {{refreshed}} {{the opera}} company's productions and added London seasons, beginning in 1919, {{as well as}} provincial and foreign tours. In 1948 Rupert died, leaving a strong company to his daughter Bridget D'Oyly Carte. However, the rising costs of mounting professional light opera without any government support eventually became <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the company. Bridget was forced to close the company in 1982. Nevertheless, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas continue to be produced frequently today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond, and Carte's vision of wholesome light operas that celebrate Great Britain endures.|$|E
5|$|The assassinations of Aurelian and Probus {{demonstrated}} that sole rulership was {{dangerous to the}} stability of the empire. Conflict boiled in every province, from Gaul to Syria, Egypt to the lower Danube. It was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> one person to control, and Diocletian needed a lieutenant. At some time in 285 at Mediolanum (Milan), Diocletian raised his fellow-officer Maximian to the office of caesar, making him co-emperor.|$|E

Elaine shares a cab ride with Kennedy, and she tells him that she lives Uptown near Jerry in order to extend the ride.

Eventually, the pressure becomes <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> her and she is the second person to be knocked out of the contest.|$|E
5|$|A {{golf course}} was {{constructed}} alongside the castle in 1900, and the estate was later sold to Sir Arthur Sutherland, a wealthy shipowner, in 1919. Sutherland opened an additional {{course at the}} castle in 1922, designed by the Scottish golfer, James Braid. The costs of maintaining the property became <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> him and, after undertaking eight years of clearance work in the 1920s, he placed the castle into the guardianship {{of the state in}} 1930, with the Commissioners of Works taking control of the property. Archaeological investigations were carried out as part of the clearance work by H. Honeyman in 1929, exposing more of the main gatehouse, and further work was carried out under Robert Bosanquet in the 1930s. Aerial photography was carried out by Walter de Aitchison for the Ordnance Survey.|$|E
5|$|After new {{investment}} at board level Revie {{was able to}} spend £25,000 on Everton's Scotland international Bobby Collins, who he installed as captain. Other arrivals included former Manchester City teammate Billy McAdams, forward Ian Lawson and left-back Cliff Mason. He spent £53,000 to bring John Charles back from Juventus, and though he proved not to {{be as effective as}} during his first spell at Leeds, Revie was able to sell him on to Roma for a £17,000 profit within just a few months. Leeds pushed for promotion in 1962–63, but the harsh winter caused many postponements and a backlog of games {{at the end of the}} season proved <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> Leeds, who fell away to finish in fifth place.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1992 Parry favoured a deal with ITV, but thought the network {{should be prepared to}} pay up towards £30 million for live football. At a meeting in January 1992, Dyke made it clear ITV would not be positioned as they were already paying <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> football. He and executive director Trevor East commented on BSkyB's debt and felt the company would be forced to increase their borrowing if they were awarded a contract. This did not dissuade Quinton, who urged Murdoch to bid. Quinton even informed Chisholm that there were no bidding rules.|$|E
5|$|Ernest {{decided that}} the train {{journeys}} and frozen limbs were <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> his son, so he sent Bill to St Patrick's College, Goulburn as a boarder in 1921, where he quickly showed his athletic flair by becoming {{a member of the}} school's rugby league, tennis, athletics and cricket teams. He held a state record for the triple jump. At the same time, he also represented the town team. During his time at St Patrick's, O'Reilly developed his ruthless and parsimonious attitude towards bowling. After three years at the Irish Catholic school, funded by a scholarship, O'Reilly completed his Leaving Certificate.|$|E
5|$|In 1782, Prince Alfred was inoculated against smallpox. The {{sickness}} proved <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> {{the child}} and in June {{he was taken to}} Deal with his governess Lady Charlotte Finch to recover. It was hoped that the sea air, bathing in the water, and horseback riding would improve his condition. While he was there, Alfred endeared himself to many, including an old woman whom he waved to. In spite of his charming disposition, he continued to break out in spots and his chest was troubling him. When he returned to Windsor in August 1782, the doctors inspected him and realized that the boy had only weeks to live. After suffering bouts of fever and continuing problems with his chest, Prince Alfred died on 20 August 1782, at Windsor Castle, Berkshire, not even two years old.|$|E

5|$|In 1915 Sir Kenneth Muir Mackenzie, who {{had served}} as Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Office, was close to retirement. The current Lord Chancellor Lord Haldane {{believed}} that the duties of a Lord Chancellor were <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> one man, and should be divided between a Lord Chancellor and a Minister of Justice. As such he looked for a Permanent Secretary who was a qualified lawyer and who could help him set up a Ministry of Justice after the war, appointing Schuster in early 1915. The two did not work together, however, until Haldane became Lord Chancellor {{for a second time}} in 1924; he was forced to resign several months before Schuster started work on 2 July 1915 after being accused of pro-German sympathies.|$|E
5|$|In 1973 the LPO {{was caught}} up in a {{recurring}} phenomenon of London orchestral life: the conviction in official circles that having four independent orchestras is <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> one city, and that two or more of the existing ensembles should merge. On this occasion the targets were the LPO and the New Philharmonia; the latter, a self-governing body formed under its new name when the Philharmonia was disbanded in 1964, was going through a bad patch, professionally and financially. The proposed merger would inevitably have led to redundancies, and the player-owners of both orchestras rejected the plan.|$|E
5|$|In August 1849 the MCS {{appointed}} Joseph Bazalgette to {{the position}} of assistant surveyor. He had been working as a consultant engineer in the railway industry until overwork had brought about a serious breakdown in his health; his appointment to the commission was his first position on his return to employment. Working under the chief engineer, Frank Foster, he began to develop a more systematic plan for the city's sewers. The stress of his position was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> Foster and he died in 1852; Bazalgette was promoted into his position, and continued refining and developing the plans {{for the development of the}} sewerage system. The Metropolis Management Act 1855 replaced the commission with the Metropolitan Board of Works (MBW), which took control of the sewers.|$|E

5|$|In June 1904, Beilhart {{invited the}} public to an 'open house' where he {{attempted}} to explain the motives and beliefs of the society. Over 400 people attended the gathering. Among them, it has been claimed, were Clarence Darrow and Elbert Hubbard but {{this has not been}} documented, although Beilhart is known to have visited Hubbard in East Aurora and Darrow was a frequent visitor to the society during the Chicago and Ingleside years. In the end, the society's rejection of marriage {{on the grounds that it}} made a 'slave of the woman', and the misinterpretations of their views on free-love were <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the people of Lisbon to accept. In late 1904, the group left Lisbon for Chicago, in the hope that their progressive ideas might be better tolerated there.|$|E
5|$|In the {{commentary}} for the episode, Anderson elaborated on Scully and Waterston's original backstory: after Scully and Waterston {{came close to}} having an affair, Scully left to study at Quantico to become an FBI agent. After she left, Waterston become depressed, and his family began to suspect the affair. The emotional turmoil was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> Waterston's wife, who killed herself, which made Waterston's daughter, Maggie, resent Scully, {{as shown in the}} finished episode. Anderson felt that the removal of this backstory made it hard for the audience to understand why Maggie was so angry at Scully.|$|E
5|$|On February 13, the Kentucky House {{achieved}} a quorum, and the Senate did so the following day. Having lost {{the battle against}} the special session, Laffoon proposed a primary with a run-off if no candidate received a majority on the first ballot. Some, including Chandler, believed this action was aimed against former governor and senator J. C. W. Beckham, who Laffoon believed would challenge Rhea for the Democratic nomination. They believed that a double primary would be <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the aging Beckham to endure. Supporters of a single primary found {{they did not have}} the votes in the legislature to pass it, so they agreed to a double primary, which Laffoon signed into law on February 27, 1935.|$|E
