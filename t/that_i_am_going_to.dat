Although his political activity was tolerated and on a few occasions {{he was allowed to}} travel abroad, Payá reported that both he and his family were subject to routine intimidation: [...] "I have been told <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be killed before the regime is over but I am not going to run away." ...|$|E
500|$|Harry and the Potters couple their rough-edged {{music with}} themed lyrics, which define the band {{as much as}} the costumes. The straight-forward but quirky {{presentation}} of adolescent concerns and direness in the simplest of worries gives the songs their easy likeability. They poke fun at awkward situations from the books. For example, in the song [...] "The Human Hosepipe", they sing, [...] "Maybe you shouldn't have brought up Cedric Diggory/ Because I'd rather not talk about your dead ex-boyfriends over coffee." [...] Two other examples of the bands distinctive take on teenage angst are seen in the song [...] "Save Ginny Weasley" [...] where they sing, [...] "Are you petrified of being petrified?" [...] and the song [...] "The Godfather." [...] where the gothic or mock-morbid line [...] "Why do I always think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die?" [...] is sung to an up-beat tune.|$|E
500|$|When the {{platform}} debate {{began in the}} Chicago Coliseum {{on the morning of}} July 9, 1896, Tillman was the opening speaker. Although met with applause and shouts of his name, he [...] "spoke in the same manner that had won him success in South Carolina, cursing, haranguing his enemies, and raising the specter of sectionalism. He, however, thoroughly alienated the national audience". According to Richard Bensel in his study of the 1896 convention, Tillman gave [...] "by far, the most divisive speech of the convention, an address that embarrassed the silver wing of the party as much as it enraged the hard-money faction". He deemed silver a sectional issue, pitting the wealthy East against the oppressed South and West. This upset delegates, who wished to view silver as a patriotic, national issue, and some voiced their dissent, disagreeing with Tillman. The senator alternately offended, confused, and bored the delegates, who shouted for Tillman to stop even though less than half of his time had expired. Beset by shouting delegates and one of the convention bands, which unexpectedly appeared and began to play, Tillman nevertheless pressed on, [...] "the audience might just as well understand <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have my say if I stand here until sundown." [...] By the time he had his say, he had [...] "effectively destroyed his chances to become a national candidate". With Tillman's candidacy stillborn (only his home state voted for him), Bryan seized the opportunity to deliver an address in support of silver that did not rely on sectionalism. His Cross of Gold speech won him the presidential nomination.|$|E

2500|$|Taishi Ci died in 206 {{at the age}} of 41 (by East Asian age reckoning). Before his death, {{he sighed}} and said, [...] "A man living in this world should aspire to carry a seven chi-long sword and rise to the {{position}} of a Son of Heaven. Now, I have yet to realise my ambition. How unfortunate <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die soon!" [...] Sun Quan deeply mourned Taishi Ci's death.|$|E
2500|$|After the incidents, South Carolina {{governor}} Nikki Haley said on May 30, 2014 {{that with}} {{the damage to the}} area's reputation hurting tourism and efforts to attract other industries, [...] "It is time for that Bikefest to come to an end, and that is the way <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> talk to the elected officials of Atlantic Beach." [...] Haley, who was in Conway to talk about hurricane safety, emphasized that the incidents do not reflect the state as a whole. The previous day, Atlantic Beach Mayor Jake Evans said the event would not be cancelled; he pointed out {{that the vast majority of}} bikers are good people. Chief Warren Gall of the Myrtle Beach Police Department, however, believed the shooting was related to the rally.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of December 3, 1988, Ruiz, Reyes, their son Fernando, and Fernando's wife Leticia, who was {{pregnant}} with their fourth child, were all praying the Rosary. [...] Ruiz in particular was praying for her son Reyes Jr., who was struggling with cocaine addiction and for Fernando and Leticia's marriage. [...] During the final decade, Ruiz says she saw a light emanating from {{a portrait of the}} Immaculate Heart of Mary that grew brighter until it forced her to close her eyes. [...] At that moment, the Virgin spoke to her: [...] "Don't you know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take care of your children?" [...] Ruiz was overcome with emotion and began to cry, calling out, [...] "Qué linda! Qué linda!" [...] ("She's beautiful! She's beautiful!").|$|E

2500|$|Towards noon, as Dupont's guns went quiet, Vedel {{continued}} from Guarromán onto Bailén {{and observed}} napping troops which he {{assumed to be}} Dupont's vanguard returning from Andújar—in fact they were Reding's Spaniards. Vedel and Reding prepared for battle, the former pulling up Legrange's cuirassiers, Cassagne's legion, and Dufour's brigade for the attack. On the Spanish side, Reding deployed Coupigny's division to meet the threat, with an Irish battalion and two guns on a knoll {{leading up to the}} mountains; a regiment of regular troops, the Órdenes militares, at the San Cristóbal monastery; militia in support; and the other battalions drawn up behind, in the centre. Two Spanish officers approached Vedel under a flag of truce, announcing that Dupont had been badly defeated and had proposed to suspend arms; the Frenchman replied, [...] "Tell your General, that I care nothing about that, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> attack him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Transformer {{brothers}} {{also knew}} where he was, but he didn't look and just held his pole steady. The brothers came and landed {{on the side of}} the canoe.

Oh this here, this is my food <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> feed you with." [...] He tells the three men, [...] "I have a house right here, right there in that little bay. You bring your canoe over and come up ashore." [...] He pulled up his pole and had a lot of the moss ready. In the house, he had a big fire ready and a mountain of rock underneath, already hot. He took some sticks and grabbed the hot rocks and put them in a bowl that was filled with water. When the rocks were dropped in, the water began to boil. He took the boiling water and placed the moss inside and then made soup. The tells the men to have a seat on his bench with his big hyu7kem plate. This was the first hyu7kem plate made because he knew these men were coming. It made this plate really fancy, and fed them with three Mountain Goat horn spoons. The three men ate the moss.|$|E
