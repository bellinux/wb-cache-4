5|$|The painted {{surface is}} divided into {{quarters}} horizontally and sevenths vertically; this grid is used to organise the elaborate grouping of characters, and was a common device at the time. Velázquez presents nine figures—eleven if the king and queen's reflected images are included—yet <b>they</b> <b>occupy</b> only {{the lower half of}} the canvas.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{richness}} of high-quality habitats in Yosemite, the brown bear, California condor, and least Bell's vireo have become extinct in the park within historical time, and another 37 species currently have special status under either California or federal endangered species legislation. The most serious current threats to Yosemite's wildlife and the ecosystems <b>they</b> <b>occupy</b> include loss of a natural fire regime, exotic species, air pollution, habitat fragmentation, and climate change. On a more local basis, factors such as road kills {{and the availability of}} human food have affected some wildlife species.|$|E
5|$|The Betsimisaraka ("the many inseparables") are {{the second}} largest ethnic group in Madagascar after the Merina and make up {{approximately}} fifteen percent of the Malagasy people. <b>They</b> <b>occupy</b> a large stretch of the eastern coastal region of Madagascar, from Mananjary {{in the south to}} Antalaha in the north. The Betsimisaraka {{have a long history of}} extensive interaction with European seafarers and traders that produced a significant subset with mixed European-Malagasy origins, termed the zana-malata. European influence is evident in the local valse (waltz) and basesa musical genres, which are typically performed on the accordion. Tromba (spirit possession) ceremonies feature strongly in Betsimisaraka culture.|$|E

30|$|Among {{these local}} regimes, the Huns had {{established}} three; the Di, four; the Jie, one; the Xianbei, seven; the Qiang, one; and the Han, three. <b>They</b> <b>occupied</b> parts of modern-day Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, Gansu, Ningxia, Sichuan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Liaoning, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, and other provinces. Effectively, <b>they</b> <b>occupied</b> the entire Central Plains region.|$|R
5|$|The player guides Agent 47, {{protagonist of}} the Hitman franchise, {{through a series}} of grid-based levels. Levels are {{composed}} of nodes and lines, and presented like a board game with characters modelled as miniature figures. Enemy characters can be dispatched by moving onto the node <b>they</b> <b>occupy</b> during a turn, similar to chess. As the player advances through levels, new enemy types and mechanics are introduced to increase the complexity of puzzle solutions.|$|E
5|$|A thunderstorm, {{also known}} as an {{electrical}} storm, lightning storm, or thundershower, is a storm characterized {{by the presence of}} lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere, known as thunder. Thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus. They are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain, and sometimes snow, sleet, hail, or, in contrast, no precipitation at all. Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband, known as a squall line. Strong or severe thunderstorms, known as supercells, rotate as do cyclones. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that <b>they</b> <b>occupy,</b> vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic puffin {{and other}} pelagic birds are {{excellent}} bioindicators {{of the environment}} as <b>they</b> <b>occupy</b> a high trophic level. Heavy metals and other pollutants are concentrated through the food chain and, as fish are the primary food source for Atlantic puffins, there is great potential for them to bioaccumulate heavy metals such as mercury and arsenic. Measurements can be made on eggs, feathers or internal organs and beached bird surveys, accompanied by chemical analysis of feathers, can be effective indicators of marine pollution by lipophilic substances as well as metals. In fact these surveys {{can be used to}} provide evidence of the adverse effects of a particular pollutant, using fingerprinting techniques to provide evidence suitable for the prosecution of offenders.|$|E

50|$|The {{movements}} of the group were tracked to the positions <b>they</b> <b>occupied</b> 11.5Myr ago, where <b>they</b> <b>occupied</b> a space 3 times smaller than their current distribution (24pc, versus 72pc today) situated in between two regions of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB star group, and {{it was suggested that}} they originated there when a supernova from either OB region of Scorpius-Centaurus OB would have been close enough to trigger stellar formation.|$|R
5|$|The Guianan cock-of-the-rock has {{distinctive}} territorial markings. Males {{usually take}} dominance {{of an area}} on the ground, although they sometimes <b>they</b> <b>occupy</b> middle strata in forests. They make their characteristic marking by clearing out debris from the ground, including twigs, leaves, and pellets. This area is called a “court”. Quality of courts {{are known to have}} some influence on mate choice. The court quality is determined by the territory density and location to the center of activity in the lek. The reason for the focus on the center of activity in the lek is that successful males tended to own courts in the most densely clustered lek areas. Guianan courts are commonly found in the Guianan Shield, a forested region in northeastern South America.|$|E
25|$|Naturally, two {{stones are}} said to be {{adjacent}} if <b>they</b> <b>occupy</b> adjacent intersections. Similarly, a stone and an intersection are adjacent if the stone occupies an intersection adjacent to that intersection.|$|E
25|$|The parish boasts what {{is thought}} {{by some to}} be one of the best {{secondary}} level schools in the nation, St Mary High School, from which several outstanding people have come. <b>They</b> <b>occupy</b> several reputable positions in varying sectors both at home and overseas.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of oil brought more Christians to Kirkuk, however {{they were also}} affected by the Arabization policy of the Baath Party. Their numbers continued to plummet after the American invasion, and <b>they</b> <b>occupy</b> 4% of municipal offices, a percentage thought to be representative of their numbers in the city. They number around 2,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{indigenous}} {{people in the}} province are the Mangyans (Manguianes in Spanish, Mañguianes in Old Tagalog), consisting of 7 distinct tribes. <b>They</b> <b>occupy</b> the foothills and interior. The Mangyan have inhabited the island since pre-history. They {{are believed to have}} originally traveled from Indonesia and settled down for good in the island.|$|E
25|$|Community {{involvement}} and related approaches—Community-managed MPAs empower local communities to operate partially or completely {{independent of the}} governmental jurisdictions <b>they</b> <b>occupy.</b> Empowering communities to manage resources can lower conflict levels and enlist the support of diverse groups that rely on the resource such as subsistence and commercial fishers, scientists, recreation, tourism businesses, youths and others.|$|E

25|$|Osteocytes {{are mostly}} {{inactive}} osteoblasts. Osteocytes originate from osteoblasts that have migrated into and become trapped {{and surrounded by}} bone matrix that they themselves produced. The spaces <b>they</b> <b>occupy</b> are known as lacunae. Osteocytes have many processes that reach out to meet osteoblasts and other osteocytes probably {{for the purposes of}} communication.|$|E
25|$|The wider {{bodies of}} larger {{vehicles}} mean <b>they</b> <b>occupy</b> {{a greater percentage}} of road lanes. This is particularly noticeable on the narrow roads sometimes found in dense urban areas or rural areas in Europe. Wider vehicles may also have difficulty fitting in some parking spaces and encroach further into traffic lanes when parked alongside the road.|$|E
25|$|There are no formalised rules {{regarding}} {{observation and}} monitoring, but many educators {{have an interest}} in working with interaction-based observation. It is common for an institution to hold parent consultations, where the staff of the institution discuss with individual children's parents how children thrive in the institution, what <b>they</b> <b>occupy</b> themselves with, their strong and weak points, and about their social relationship with other children.|$|E

25|$|Muhammad's 700 men met the 3000 of the Quraish in the Battle of Uhud {{and were}} defeated. The Quraish, however, {{did not succeed}} in killing Muhammad, nor did <b>they</b> <b>occupy</b> the town of Medina, {{possibly}} because they knew it was guarded by Ibn Ubayy. Rodinson suggests that the Meccans did not want to reforge the very unity of the population, which had been jeopardised by Muhammad's defeat.|$|E
25|$|Other nearshore or {{shallow water}} fish {{live near the}} shore in depths of less than 10 metres. <b>They</b> <b>occupy</b> the areas over sandy or rocky bottoms, and can be {{associated}} with seagrass meadows and kelp forests. They can be divided into demersal fish and pelagic fish. Demersal fish live on or near the sea floor, while pelagic fish live in the water column away the sea floor.|$|E
25|$|Two-family {{houses were}} village residences either {{originally}} built or later modified to house an owner and tenant. They are generally {{similar to that}} form, except for some turn-of-the-century designs where architects {{took advantage of the}} larger size to scale the form up. Some were divided vertically to look like two row houses. They are usually two stories in height, taking up most of the larger lots <b>they</b> <b>occupy,</b> leaving little room for yards.|$|E
