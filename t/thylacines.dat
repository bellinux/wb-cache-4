The finished hologram had its debut at the SA Museum as part of the Inaugural Innovate SA festival in September 1995.|$|E
50|$|Further work in 2012 {{examined}} {{the relationship of the}} genetic diversity of the <b>thylacines</b> before their extinction. The results indicated that the last of the <b>thylacines</b> in Australia, on top of the threats from dingoes, had limited genetic diversity, due to their complete geographic isolation from mainland Australia.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Thylacine</b> Museum — online 1999. The <b>Thylacine</b> Museum is {{an online}} {{scientific}} and educational resource aimed at promoting a greater awareness {{and understanding of}} the biology, behaviour and history of the <b>thylacine,</b> or Tasmanian tiger (Thylacinus cynocephalus).|$|R
50|$|The <b>thylacine</b> {{is likely}} to have become near-extinct in {{mainland}} Australia about 2,000 years ago, and possibly earlier in New Guinea. The absolute extinction is attributed to competition from indigenous humans and invasive dingoes. Doubts exist over the impact of the dingo since the two species would not have been in direct competition with one another as the dingo hunts primarily during the day, whereas it is thought that the <b>thylacine</b> hunted mostly at night. In addition, the <b>thylacine</b> had a more powerful build, which would have given it an advantage in one-on-one encounters. Recent morphological examinations of dingo and <b>thylacine</b> skulls show that although the dingo had a weaker bite, its skull could resist greater stresses, allowing it to pull down larger prey than the <b>thylacine</b> could. The <b>thylacine</b> was also much less versatile in diet than the omnivorous dingo. Their environments clearly overlapped: <b>thylacine</b> subfossil remains have been discovered in proximity to those of dingoes. The adoption of the dingo as a hunting companion by the indigenous peoples would have put the <b>thylacine</b> under increased pressure.|$|R
40|$|The <b>thylacine</b> (Thylacinus cynocephalus) was Australia’s largest {{marsupial}} carnivore {{until its}} extinction {{within the last}} century. There remains considerable interest and debate regard-ing the biology of this species. Studies of <b>thylacine</b> biology are now limited to preserved specimens, and parts thereof, as well as written historical accounts of its biology. This study describes {{the development of the}} immune tissues of a pouch young <b>thylacine,</b> one of only eleven in existence, and the only specimen to be histologically sectioned. The appearance of the immune tissue of the developing pouch young <b>thylacine</b> is compared to the immune tissues of extant marsupials, providing insights into the immunity, biology and ecology of the extinct <b>thylacine...</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2008, a {{group of}} <b>thylacines</b> was purportedly {{captured}} on video in Victoria, but the veracity of the footage remains unconfirmed.

40|$|We {{report the}} first two {{complete}} mitochondrial genome sequences of the <b>thylacine</b> (Thylacinus cynocephalus), or so-called Tasmanian tiger, extinct since 1936. The <b>thylacine's</b> phylogenetic position within australidelphian marsupials has long been debated, and here we provide {{strong support for the}} <b>thylacine's</b> basal position in Dasyuromorphia, aided by mitochondrial genome sequence that we generated from the extant numbat (Myrmecobius fasciatus). Surprisingly, both of our <b>thylacine</b> sequences differ by 11 %– 15 % from putative <b>thylacine</b> mitochondrial genes in GenBank, with one of our samples originating from a direct offspring of the previously sequenced individual. Our data sample each mitochondrial nucleotide an average of 50 times, thereby providing the first high-fidelity reference sequence for <b>thylacine</b> population genetics. Our two sequences differ in only five nucleotides out of 15, 452, hinting at a very low genetic diversity shortly before extinction. Despite the samples’ heavy contamination with bacterial and human DNA and their temperate storage history, we estimate that as much as one-third of the total DNA in each sample is from the <b>thylacine.</b> The microbial content of the two <b>thylacine</b> samples was subjected to metagenomic analysis, and showed striking differences between a wild-captured individual and a born-in-captivity one. This study therefore adds to the growing evidence that extensive sequencing of museum collections is both feasible and desirable, and can yield complete genomes...|$|R
40|$|The <b>thylacine</b> {{looms large}} in Tasmanian culture. The animal’s image is everywhere, present on {{everything}} from beer labels to licence plates. The documentary footage of the last <b>thylacine</b> in Hobart Zoo has come to exemplify, among other things, the tragedy of species loss and humanity’s violence against the nonhuman. This footage features {{at the beginning of}} both The Hunter and Dying Breed – two of the very small number of films that constitute a notional Tasmanian cinema. In contrast to the meanings suggested by the documentary images of the last <b>thylacine</b> however, the fictional Tasmanian tiger in these films becomes a repository for those aspects of humanity that need to be expunged. In The Hunter, the <b>thylacine’s</b> dead body is potential raw material for weapons production by a biotech company. In Dying Breed, the <b>thylacine</b> is aligned with a cannibalistic community – implicitly descendent from cannibal convict Alexander Pearce – who rape female tourists in order to perpetuate their kind. In these two texts the <b>thylacine</b> therefore symbolically embodies humanity’s inhumanity, degeneracy, and monstrosity – qualities that The Hunter gestures towards wiping out through the eponymous hero’s enactment of the <b>thylacine’s</b> ‘final’ extinction. The narratives of The Hunter and Dying Breed assert man’s right to violently determine survival and reproduction. These politics resonate with the <b>thylacine’s</b> history both in terms of the significance of the hunt in her extinction and the confinement of the last <b>thylacine</b> in a zoo – an environment where reproduction is fully governed by humans...|$|R

40|$|Until recently, the {{earliest}} surviving {{photograph of a}} <b>thylacine</b> (albeit that of a dead trophy specimen) was from 1869.

This paper describes its recent rediscovery, and {{the identity of the}} <b>thylacine</b> it portrays.

50|$|Johnson and Wroe {{observed}} {{the relationship between}} the dingo and the extinctions of the Tasmanian devil, the <b>thylacine,</b> and the Tasmanian native hen and the arrival of humans. The paper documented the obviously competitive relationship between the dingo, the <b>thylacine</b> and the Tasmanian devil, and noted that the dingo may have actually fed on the native hen. Yet, the paper concludes, people ignore the emergence of humans on the continent among all of this. In the end, the competitiveness of the dingo and <b>thylacine</b> populations led to the extinctions of the <b>thylacine,</b> but the arrival of the humans only further exacerbated this.|$|R
50|$|As {{the devil}} is the thylacine's closest relative, there has been {{speculation}} that the thylacine could be revived by combining DNA from museum samples of <b>thylacines</b> with ova of the devil.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thylacines,</b> uniquely for marsupials, {{have largely}} {{cartilaginous}} epipubic bones {{with a highly}} reduced osseous element. This has been once considered a synapomorphy with sparassodonts, though its now thought that both groups reduced their epipubics independently.|$|E
50|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} shows that <b>thylacines</b> are a clade {{which does not}} include the dasyurids. Badjcinus {{was one of the most}} primitive members of its group, living 23 to 28 million years ago in the late Oligocene.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the living}} grey wolf is {{widely seen as}} the <b>thylacine's</b> counterpart, it has been {{proposed}} that the <b>thylacine</b> {{was more of an}} ambush predator as opposed to a pursuit predator. In fact, the predatory behaviour of the <b>thylacine</b> was probably closer to ambushing felids than to large pursuit canids. Consequently, {{at least in terms of}} the postcranial anatomy, the vernacular name of [...] "Tasmanian tiger" [...] may be more apt than [...] "marsupial wolf".|$|R
50|$|It {{was always}} {{possible}} {{to make a few}} shillings on the side after the government introduced a bounty scheme for trapping and killing Tasmanian tigers (<b>thylacines)</b> in 1888, with a number of claims being made upon the government by settlers in the Levendale area.|$|E
5000|$|The zoo {{was home}} to the only living quagga ever to be photographed, before the species became extinct in the wild due to hunting in {{southern}} Africa in about 1870. Another now extinct species the zoo held was a number of <b>thylacines,</b> or [...] "Tasmanian tigers".|$|E
50|$|Native fauna {{advisory}} committees {{began to be}} established to address the concern of rapidly dwindling populations {{of a number of}} mammal species.

This was also the beginning of a Tasmanian wilderness movement.|$|E

40|$|The Tasmanian Tiger or <b>thylacine</b> (Thylacinus cynocephalus) {{continues}} to stalk the Tasmanian imagination. Miasmas resembling it figure in reports from tourists and bushwalkers, who happen upon the slinking apparition in the wilderness. Fanciful meanderings of wishful hearts and minds? Perhaps. Tantalising suspicions that the <b>thylacine</b> may still exist {{will not go}} away. No matter that the last <b>thylacine</b> died in the Hobart Zoo on 7 September 1936. With it died a species, but not the legend. In both these books, stringent research has brought the authors to the salient truth that the <b>thylacine</b> is, on available evidence, extinct. There are no contemporary photographs of the animal in the wild since 1936, when the last images of a caged and morose survivor were taken. Nor are there plaster casts of fresh paw tracks. However, the <b>thylacine</b> stubbornly inhabits {{the minds of those}} who want to believe...|$|R
50|$|Only placentals, and {{possibly}} the early mammaliformes Megazostrodon and Erythrotherium, lack them; in <b>thylacines</b> and sparassodonts, {{they appear to have}} become primarily cartilaginous and the osseous element has become strongly reduced or even absent. Trichosurus mimicked placentals in shifting hypaxial muscles attachment sites from the epipubic to the pelvis, losing the respiratory benefits (see below), but otherwise retains large epipubics.|$|E
50|$|Sparassodonts have highly reduced epipubic bones, to {{the point}} that early {{analysis}} couldn't even find evidence for them. This is a characteristic shared with the Australian thylacine, and historically argued as a synapomorphy, though nowadays it is considered to have developed independently for poorly understood reasons. Like with <b>thylacines,</b> it is very likely that they possessed long cartilaginous elements instead.|$|E
5000|$|Owen and Pemberton {{believe that}} the {{relationship}} between Tasmanian devils and <b>thylacines</b> was [...] "close and complex", as they competed directly for prey and probably also for shelter. The <b>thylacines</b> preyed on the devils, the devils scavenged from the thylacine's kills, and the devils ate thylacine young. Menna Jones hypothesises that the two species shared the role of apex predator in Tasmania. Wedge-tailed eagles have a similar carrion-based diet to the devils and are regarded as competitors. Quolls and devils are also seen as being in direct competition in Tasmania. Jones believed that the quoll has evolved into its current state in just 100-200 generations of around two years as determined by the equal spacing effect on the devil, the largest species, the spotted-tail quoll, and the smallest species, the eastern quoll. Both the Tasmanian devil and the quolls appears to have evolved up to 50 times faster than the average evolutionary rate amongst mammals.|$|E
5000|$|The last captive <b>thylacine,</b> later {{referred}} to as [...] "Benjamin", was trapped in the Florentine Valley by Elias Churchill in 1933, {{and sent to the}} Hobart Zoo where it lived for three years. The <b>thylacine</b> died on 7 September 1936. It is believed to have died as the result of neglect—locked out of its sheltered sleeping quarters, it was exposed to a rare occurrence of extreme Tasmanian weather: extreme heat during the day and freezing temperatures at night. The <b>thylacine</b> features in the last known motion picture footage of a living specimen: 62 seconds of black-and-white footage showing the <b>thylacine</b> in its enclosure in a clip taken in 1933, by naturalist David Fleay. In the film footage, the <b>thylacine</b> is seen seated, walking around the perimeter of its enclosure, yawning (exposing its impressive gape), sniffing the air, scratching itself (in the same manner as a dog), and lying down.|$|R
50|$|The International <b>Thylacine</b> Specimen Database (ITSD) is the {{culmination}} of a four-year research project to catalogue and digitally photograph all known surviving specimen material of the <b>thylacine</b> (Thylacinus cynocephalus) (or Tasmanian tiger) held within museum, university, and private collections.|$|R
40|$|The Tasmanian tiger or <b>thylacine</b> was {{the largest}} {{carnivorous}} marsupial when Europeans first reached Australia. Sadly, the last known <b>thylacine</b> died in captivity in 1936. A recent analysis of the genome of the closely related and extant Tasmanian devil demonstrated limited genetic diversity between individuals. While a similar lack of diversity has been reported for the <b>thylacine,</b> this analysis was based on just two individuals. Here we report the sequencing of an additional 12 museum-archived specimens collected between 102 and 159 years ago. We examined {{a portion of the}} mitochondrial DNA hyper-variable control region and determined that all sequences were on average 99. 5 % identical at the nucleotide level. As a measure of accuracy we also sequenced mitochondrial DNA from a mother and two offspring. As expected, these samples were found to be 100 % identical, validating our methods. We also used 454 sequencing to reconstruct 2. 1 kilobases of the mitochondrial genome, which shared 99. 91 % identity with the two complete <b>thylacine</b> mitochondrial genomes published previously. Our <b>thylacine</b> genomic data also contained three highly divergent putative nuclear mitochondrial sequences, which grouped phylogenetically with the published <b>thylacine</b> mitochondrial homologs but contained 100 -fold more polymorphisms than the conserved fragments.
