Each manufacturer may define additional modes above #9 (e.g.: mode 22 as defined by SAE J2190 for Ford/GM, mode 21 for Toyota) for other information e.g. the voltage of the <b>traction</b> <b>battery</b> in a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV).|$|E
25|$|As {{defined by}} the 2009 ACES Act, a PEV is a vehicle which draws {{propulsion}} energy from a <b>traction</b> <b>battery</b> with at least 4 kwh of capacity and uses an offboard source of energy to recharge such battery. The tax credit for new plug-in electric vehicles is worth $2,500 plus $417 for each kilowatt-hour of battery capacity over 4 kwh, and {{the portion of the}} credit determined by battery capacity cannot exceed $5,000. Therefore, the maximum amount of the credit allowed for a new PEV is $7,500. Both the Nissan Leaf electric vehicle and the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, launched in December 2010, are eligible for the maximum $7,500 tax credit. The Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid, released in January 2012, is eligible for a $2,500 tax credit due to its smaller battery capacity of 5.2 kWh. All Tesla cars and Chevrolet Bolts are eligible for the 7,500 tax credit.|$|E

25|$|The Second Generation Prius {{contains}} a 1.310kWh battery, composed of 28 modules. Each battery module {{is made of}} 6 individual 1.2V 6.5Ah Prismatic NiMH cells in series forming a 7.2V 6.5Ah module with 46Wh/kg energy density and 1.3kW/kg output power density. Each module {{contains a}}n integrated charge controller and relay. These modules are connected 28 in series to form a 201.6V 6.5Ah battery (<b>traction</b> <b>battery),</b> {{also known as the}} energy storage system. The computer controlled charge controller and battery management computer systems keep this battery between 38% and 82% state of charge, with a tendency to keep the average state of charge around 60%. By shallow cycling the battery {{only a small portion of}} its net available energy storage capacity is available for use (approximately 400Wh) by the hybrid drive system, but the shallow computer controlled cycling dramatically improves the cycle life, thermal management control, and net long term calendar life of the battery. Active cooling of this battery is achieved by a blower motor and air ducting, while passive thermal management was accomplished through the metal case design.|$|E
500|$|There is an auxiliary, 12volt {{conventional}} {{lead acid}} battery under the bonnet/hood for the accessories.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{single-phase}} reconfigurable battery charger for Electric Vehicle (EV) that operates {{in three different}} modes: Grid-to-Vehicle (G 2 V) mode, in which the <b>traction</b> <b>batteries</b> are charged from the power grid; Vehicle-to-Grid (V 2 G) mode, in which the <b>traction</b> <b>batteries</b> deliver part of the stored energy back to the power grid; and in Traction-to-Auxiliary (T 2 A) mode, in which the auxiliary battery is charged from the <b>traction</b> <b>batteries.</b> When connected to the power grid, the battery charger works with sinusoidal current in the AC side, for both G 2 V and V 2 G modes, and also regulates the reactive power. When the EV is disconnected from the power grid, the control algorithms are modified and the full-bridge AC-DC bidirectional converter works as a full-bridge isolated DC-DC converter {{that is used to}} charge the auxiliary battery of the EV, avoiding the use of an additional charger to accomplish this task. To assess the behavior of the proposed reconfigurable battery charger under different operation scenarios, a 3. 6 kW laboratory prototype has been developed and experimental results are presented.
