40|$|This paper used {{parametric}} shared-frailty {{models to}} observe the recession periods of 22 countries. The constant increases in the values of change in consumer prices, foreign exchange reserves (FERs), ratio of foreign direct investment to gross domestic product (GDP), ratio of domestic credits to GDP, and ratio of monetary base to FERs were found to shorten the recession periods of economies. On the other hand, a steady increase in real effective exchange rates, economic openness, and lending-to-deposit ratio can lead to longer recessions. Moreover, economies were found <b>to</b> <b>diverge</b> after <b>currency</b> crises, whereas no apparent differences in economies were observed before crises; and this is attributed to some economies access to financing opportunities, whereas others have lesser and even faced enforceability problems...|$|R

40|$|When {{moving from}} a {{plurality}} rule to a proportional system, members of national parliament have more incentives <b>to</b> <b>diverge</b> from the median voter's preferences. We match voting behavior concerning legislative proposals of Swiss members of parliament with real referenda outcomes on the same issues for the years 1996 to 2009. This quasi-experimental data allows us to identify whether differences in electoral systems induce members of parliament <b>to</b> <b>diverge</b> from the choices of the median voter. Empirical results indicate that members of parliament from districts with proportional representation tend <b>to</b> <b>diverge</b> significantly more from the median voter's preferences than members of parliament from districts with plurality rule...|$|R

25|$|The phylogenetics of {{this group}} are complex and evolving. The Medusozoa and Octocorallia are {{proposed}} as sister groups according to research published in 2012. That research also proposes coronate Scyphozoa and Cubozoa as a sister clade to Hydrozoa and discomedusan Scyphozoa, which are themselves sister groups. The hydroidolinans are a sister group to Limnomedusae, also called Trachylina. Semaeostomae is paraphyletic with Rhizostomeae.

50|$|Within {{the family}} Eupleridae, some {{relations}} remain unclear, with evidence from several genes {{and methods of}} inference providing conflicting evidence as to the relations among Galidiinae, the fossa, and the Malagasy civet (Fossa fossana).

Morphological evidence, on the other hand, supports the relation between Mungotictis and Salanoia, but suggests that Galidictis was the earliest lineage <b>to</b> <b>diverge.</b>|$|R
