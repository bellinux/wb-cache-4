25|$|Baba Nand Singh Ji Maharaj {{said about}} Guru Nanak that Garibi, Nimrata, Humility is the Divine Flavour, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>wonderful</b> {{fragrance}} of the Lotus Feet of Lord Guru Nanak. There {{is no place}} for Ego (referred to in Sikhism as Haumain) in the sphere of Divine Love, in the sphere of true Prema Bhagti. That is why in the House of Guru Nanak one finds Garibi, Nimrata, Humility reigning supreme. Guru Nanak was an Incarnation of Divine Love and a Prophet of True Humility.|$|E
25|$|In 1841 James David Forbes, {{professor}} of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, {{came to see}} the Matterhorn. A philosopher and geologist, and an observant traveller, he continued the work of De Saussure in his journeys and his writings. He was full of admiration for the Matterhorn, calling it <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>wonderful</b> peak in the Alps, unsealed and unscalable. These words, pronounced by a man noted among all his contemporaries for his thorough knowledge of mountains, show what men's feelings then were towards the Matterhorn, and how {{at a time when the}} idea of Alpine exploration was gaining ground in their minds, the Matterhorn stood by itself as a mountain apart, of whose conquest it was vain even to dream. And such it remained till long after this; as such it was described by John Ball twenty years later in his celebrated guide-book. Forbes ascended the Theodul Pass in 1842, climbed the Breithorn, and came down to Breuil; as he descended from the savage scenery of the Matterhorn, the Italian landscapes of the Valtournanche seemed to him like paradise. Meanwhile Gottlieb Samuel Studer, the geographer, together with Melchior Ulrich, was describing and mapping the topographical features of the Zermatt peaks.|$|E

500|$|Prime Minister Stanley Bruce {{called the}} {{expedition}} [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>wonderful</b> accomplishments {{in the history}} of aviation", his government presenting Goble with a gift of £500, and £250 to McIntyre.

Though the flight is still acknowledged {{as one of the most}} important in Australian aviation, the necessity for the Air Force chief to personally command such a journey has been questioned, suggesting that it was motivated by the one-upmanship that characterised the Williams-Goble relationship. Two years later Williams would make a three-month, [...] round trip from Point Cook to the Pacific Islands, the first international flight undertaken by an RAAF plane and crew, amid similar suspicions.|$|E

The New York Critique wrote, [...] "He is an orator by divine right, and his strong, intelligent face in its picturesque setting of yellow and orange was hardly less interesting than those earnest words, and the rich, rhythmical utterance he gave them". The New York Herald noted, [...] "Vivekananda is undoubtedly the greatest figure in the Parliament of Religions.

The punting of Everett Sweeley was also an important element in Michigan's success in 1901. Sweeley was regarded as [...] "the best punter in the country." [...] Ten men, all but the center, carried the ball in turns. Michigan ran 219 plays in the Iowa game, compared to 149 run by Harvard in the Harvard–Yale game of 1901.
