The {{present study}} aimed to {{estimate}} the type of gene action of the different flax traits including <b>technical</b> <b>plant</b> length, number of capsules/plant, seed yield/plant besides oil content and fatty acid com-position of the oil from genetic study of six populations, i. e., P 1, P 2, F 1, BC 1, BC 2 and F 2 of the cross between Egyptian cultivar, Giza- 8 and the Netherlandish cultivar, Viking through 1998 / 1999 to 2002 / 2003 seasons at Alexandria, Egypt. Significant genetic variance were showed for the studied traits. Additive genetic variance contained the major component in the inheritance of seed yield and number of cap-sules/plant while both additive and dominance variance were sig-nificantly equal in <b>technical</b> <b>plant</b> length inheritance. Oil content and linolenic fatty acid were genetically controlled by additive gene effect while palmitic, stearic, oleic and linoleic acids are genetically con-trolled by dominance gene effect. Heritability estimates (broad-sense) were 91. 72, 76. 75, 71. 33 and 87. 97 % for seed yield/plant, number of capsules/plant, <b>technical</b> <b>plant</b> length and oil content, respectively. For fatty acids, heritability estimates (broad-sense) were 69. 40, 83. 09, 92. 80, 85. 38 and 89. 60 %, respectively. In narrow-sense, heritability estimates were 83. 65, 57. 79, 37. 28 and 75. 00 % for seed yield/plant, number of capsules/plant, <b>technical</b> <b>plant</b> length, and oil content, re-spectively, while for fatty acids composition were 22. 70, 26. 67, 32. 04, 32. 28 and 56. 36 % for palmitic, stearic, linoleic and linolenic acids re-spectively.

40|$|The paper {{attempts}} to revise certain {{provisions of the}} existing theory of discrete systems {{in the organization of}} hardware environment control signal transmission to a <b>technical</b> <b>plant.</b> It is known that the formation of a digital signal in discrete control problem of continuous plant is carried out by microcontroller or micro-computer and is represented by a parallel code, which dimension is determined by the hardware used. The parallel code for a digital clock cycle of the designed system is transmitted to the terminal device of a technical continuous plant, where the digital-to-analog conversion takes place. This kind of control signal transmission to the <b>technical</b> <b>plant</b> asserts its implementation by means of parallel buses. It is known that the length of a parallel bus is limited to an amount not exceeding half a meter due to the existing interference environment with modern standards of length. Thus, if the placement of the control signal and control plant is such that their connecting bus length exceeds more than half a meter, there is the inevitable transition from the parallel control signal to an allotted serial. The paper deals with the system factors arising in the transition from the parallel control signal to the serial by modern interfaces. Provisions of the paper are illustrated by an example. This paper is intended for system analytics and channel specialists. The resulting algorithm is applicable for control of plants (electric drive, in particular) in the large industrial factories...|$|E

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of nonlinear {{systems can}} be affected by undesired inputs [...] the disturbances. To decrease or to decouple the influence of those disturbances this paper deals with an advanced algorithm which solves the disturbance decoupling problem.

The algorithm is restricted to rational systems. To handle analytical systems as well, a system transformation is introduced {{in order to receive}} a rational substitute system.
