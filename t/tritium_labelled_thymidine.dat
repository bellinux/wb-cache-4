40|$|We {{have carried}} {{out a series of}} {{experiments}} to compare the response to radiation and drugs of cells disaggregated from solid tumours as assayed by clonogenic survival and by an isotope incorporation method. This latter assay consisted of measuring the 24 h uptake of <b>tritium</b> <b>labelled</b> <b>thymidine</b> into cells plated in liquid medium upon a layer of semi-solid agar. The isotope was administered 4 days after plating. For cells from the RIF- 1 mouse tumour, good agreement was seen between response to radiation, adriamycin, vincristine and CCNU as measured by the two assays. The two curves for radiation response, for example, showed similar shoulders and subsequent exponential regions. For cells from xenografts of the NCI-H 69 human small cell lung cancer line, the response to radiation was dose-related for both assays, but the curve for clonogenic assay was about twice as steep as that for isotope uptake. For a range of five cytotoxic drugs, good agreement was seen between the two assays over the first 1 1 / 2 decades of response but with a tendency for the isotope uptake curve to plateau with further increasing drug dose. It appears that, at least for these two well-defined experimental tumour systems, the isotope uptake assay can provide a rapid quantitative assessment of cellular drug and radiation sensitivity comparable to that provided by clonogenic assay but in a much shorter period of time...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the early}} {{experiments}} of Fagraeus (1), {{the role of}} plasma cells in antibody formation has been extensively studied and reviewed (2 - 7). Plasma cells {{have been found to}} contain (8 - 15) and produce (16 - 23) antibody, and apparently are the chief mediators of a humoral immune response. After the second injection of an antigen, far more plasma cells appear than after the first; this appears to be the main reason for the characteristic booster serum antibody response (18). Burnet and Fenner (2) first suggested that the secondary response might represent the proliferation of cells specifically altered by the primary immunization. Since the development of the clonal selection theory of acquired immunity (6, 24 [...] 27), there has been renewed interest {{in the nature of the}} plasma cell ancestor, the carrier of specific immunological memory. The present experiments have used autoradiographic labeling techniques to study this question. They are predicated on the uptake of tritiated (H*-) thymidine as an index of desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis (28 - 30), and the validity of our conclusions depends on a number of premises which are widely held, but still the subject of active discussion (31 - 33). The premises most directly relevant to our experiments are: (a) the <b>tritium</b> <b>label</b> on <b>thymidine</b> is stable and does not exchange; nor does thymine base exchange after incorporation into DNA; (b) DNA itself is metabolically stable and turnover is insignificant in resting mammalian cells; (c) HS-thymidine injected intravenously is rapidly distributed throughout the body, and either promptly incorporated into DNA or eliminated; (d) thymidine or H 3 -thymidine does not affect the normal behavior of the cells that have taken it up. This last premise has recently been challenged (34) ...|$|R

But due to the special properties of DNA, the usefulness of <b>labeled</b> <b>thymidine</b> may be vastly increased. DNA is perhaps the most stable substance within a cell, and unless the cell undergoes mitosis, the same molecules of DNA will remain in it indefinitely.

Both PGE 2 and PGF 2 α were detected and quantified by RIA after AA application. This suggests the synthesis of PGs from AA. These results were confirmed using <b>tritium</b> <b>labelled</b> AA. This experiment was done in connection with the fact that Pharbitis nil is a short-day plant. Arachidonic acid, a possible precursor of PGs, possibly promotes flowering of this plant.

40|$|The {{development}} of 3 H nmr spectroscopy has greatly increased the potential usefulness of <b>tritium</b> <b>labelled</b> compounds in chemical and biochemical research. The {{present study was}} undertaken in order to explore some of the applications of this technique in organic and pharmaceutical chemistry. The thesis is divided into six sections as follows: The General Introduction contains a literature survey highlighting the properties of tritium, the applications of 3 H nmr spectroscopy already reported {{and some of the}} many procedures for tritiating organic compounds. In the first chapter the problem of referencing 3 H nmr spectra and the determination of the Larmor frequency ratio is discussed; the latter was found to be dependent on bond hybridisation. The preparation of tritiated tetramethylsilane is also reported. Chapter two is concerned with the measurement of geminal coupling constants by a combination of <b>tritium</b> <b>labelling</b> of various organic compounds and 3 H nmr analysis. This approach has certain advantages over the corresponding deuteriation procedure. Chapter three describes the application of a one-step catalytic procedure (using pre-reduced PtO 2 and HTO) to the labelling of a number of drugs widely used in pharmacology. 3 H Nmr analysis shows that the 3 H is invariably incorporated into stable position. Labelling (both by 2 H and 3 H) of alpha,beta-unsaturated acids is considered in chapter four and this leads to a mechanistic study of the labelling of conjugated dienoic acids at both alpha- and beta-Positions. In the final chapter 3 H nmr spectroscopy is applied to a study of the stereochemical aspects of the <b>tritium</b> <b>labelling</b> of 5 -phenylpenta- 2, 4 -dienoic acid...|$|R
