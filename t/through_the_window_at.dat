Instead, {{to help her}} mother support their family, {{she worked as a}} soda jerk at Gaunt's Drug Store and waitress by day at the Triangle Diner, across the street from John Handley High. After watching performers <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the local radio station, she asked WINC disc jockey and talent coordinator Jimmy McCoy if she could sing on his show. Her performance in 1947 was well received, and she was asked back. This led to appearances at local nightclubs, wearing fringed Western outfits her mother made from Patsy's designs.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Someday (I Will Understand)" [...] was {{directed}} by Michael Haussman. Spears commented that he [...] " [...] a great job capturing the song, the essence and the emotion" [...] and added that the video had [...] "a different feeling" [...] from any of her previous videos. It was shot entirely in black-and-white. Spears asserted that her life had [...] "come full circle" [...] and implied that in the process she underwent changes in her soul and body, {{as shown in the}} video. It premiered on June 14, 2005 during the fifth and last episode of Spears's reality show Britney & Kevin: Chaotic, titled [...] "Veil of Secrecy". The music video features a pregnant Spears lying in bed and walking around a house while singing to her unborn child.

60|$|A vast {{rumbling}} crash {{shook the}} coral {{foundations of the}} atoll. The house quivered to it. The native servants, with bottles of whiskey and absinthe in their hands, shrank together as if for protection and stared with fear <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mighty wash of the wave lapping far up the beach {{to the corner of}} a copra-shed.|$|R

60|$|Her ladyship sat, superbly composed, {{looking out}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the placid {{landscape}} of woods and fields which surrounded Ham Farm.|$|E
6000|$|... “Cosy?” {{said his}} young daughter, Miss Patricia Doyle, raising {{her head from}} her sewing to cast a glance <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the {{whirling}} snowflakes.|$|E

60|$|He glanced <b>through</b> <b>the</b> high <b>windows</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{other end}} of the room. She laid her fingers upon his arm and led him towards the door.|$|R
5000|$|Leps, a Russian Orthodox, always chose an {{apartment}} so a church {{would be seen}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> or <b>at</b> least a road, because it [...] "always leads to a church".|$|R

60|$|Whilst {{confusion}} {{was at its}} highest, {{the carriage}} door was closed to with a bang {{and there was a}} loud, commanding cry hurled <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the coachman on his box.|$|E
6000|$|... (The others {{come running}} in, some weeping with joy, others boisterous. We see blue-jackets gazing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the curious scene. LORD LOAM comes {{accompanied}} by a naval officer, whom he is continually shaking by the hand.) ...|$|E

60|$|They {{travelled}} on {{in silence}} for a short time. Tallente looked idly <b>through</b> <b>the</b> rain-streaming <b>window</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> block of traffic, the hurrying passers-by, the cheerful warmth of the shops and restaurants.|$|R
60|$|After {{ascending}} the stairs, {{they looked}} {{out into the}} garden, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of the}} passage on the upper floor. He was still going round and round, but very slowly: his pace was fast slackening to a walk.|$|E
60|$|Allan's ruddy color {{suddenly}} deepened; {{he looked}} aside quickly <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the pouring rain. At {{the same moment}} their hands fell apart, {{and there was a}} pause of silence on either side. Midwinter was the first to speak again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will be {{even with}} him!" [...] cried the old man furiously, shaking his fist <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the dark slow-pacing figure. [...] "You just wait, Robert, and see if your old dad is {{a man to be}} played with." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "H-hain't done it yet, Alvy," [...] {{answered}} Jethro, {{still looking}} out <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> curtains <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ever ganging groups of gentlemen in the street. These groups had a never ceasing interest for Jethro Bass.|$|R
6000|$|... "Got him!" [...] <b>The</b> shout rang <b>through</b> all <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>at</b> once. It was {{followed}} by a blood-hound-like bay from Sir Christopher, a maniacal prestissimo on the organ, and loud cries, for Jimmy. But Jimmy, at my side, rolled his congested eyeballs, owl-wise.|$|R
25|$|At 12:02p.m., Harris and Klebold reentered the library, {{which was}} empty of {{surviving}} students {{except for the}} unconscious Patrick Ireland and the injured Lisa Kreutz. Once inside, they shot <b>through</b> <b>the</b> west <b>windows</b> <b>at</b> police, who returned fire. No individual was injured in this exchange.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Vyner {{shook his}} head indulgently. [...] "Girls will be girls," [...] he said, glancing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> Gertrude, who had thrown herself on the ball and was being dragged round the garden by her heels. [...] "I’m afraid you spoil them, though." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then have I, too, {{seen many}} {{pictures}} of life," [...] he began; [...] "pictures not painted, but {{seen with the}} eyes. I have looked at them like <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the man writing the letter. I have seen many pieces of life, without beginning, without end, without understanding." ...|$|E
60|$|Much as it pained him to {{withdraw}} from such amusing companions, the foreign young gentleman here felt that he, too, would retire for the present to change his garments, and glided back <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the same moment that the young officer carelessly stepped from the veranda and lounged towards the shrubbery.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, lad, you are right, {{and yet we}} must {{contrive}} to outwit them. Instead of openin' the door, I'll make my way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> small <b>window</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rear, {{which can}} be the better guarded by you and your mother while the shutter is unfastened." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By Jove, the Aunties {{are bound}} to cover {{themselves}} with glory. Let's go in and hear all about it. Behave now, you fellows, or I'll see about it afterward," [...] commanded Charley, as he paused to peer in <b>through</b> <b>the</b> clean <b>windows</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tempting display.|$|R
2500|$|After firing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>at</b> {{evacuating}} {{students and}} the police, Klebold fired his shotgun at a nearby table, injuring three students: Patrick Ireland, Daniel Steepleton, and Makai Hall. He removed his trench coat. As Klebold fired at the three, Harris grabbed his shotgun {{and walked toward the}} lower row of computer desks, firing a single shot under the first desk without looking. He hit 14-year-old Steven Curnow with a mortal wound to the neck. Harris then shot under the adjacent computer desk, injuring 17-year-old Kacey Ruegsegger with a shot which passed completely through her right shoulder and hand, also grazing her neck and severing a major artery. When she started gasping in pain, Harris tersely stated, [...] "Quit your bitching." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{raised his}} head, {{and looked for}} a moment <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> {{the shadow of the}} church against the night, so {{outlined}} that you could almost fancy that the light of the New Jerusalem was beyond it. Then he wrote, and this time not to the world at large but only to Mullins: ...|$|E
60|$|Turning, {{he glanced}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> Tom, flushed and royal, {{surrounded}} by {{the young men and}} women, under his Viking moustache lighting a cigarette from a match held to him by one of the girls. It abruptly struck Frederick that never had he lighted a cigar at a match held in a woman's hand.|$|E
60|$|Summer passed. Autumn {{came and}} went. Winter arrived. The days grew bleak and chill, {{and an early}} fall of snow, heavier than had been known {{at that time of}} the year for a long while, put an end to golf. Mortimer spent his days indoors, staring gloomily <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the white mantle that covered the earth.|$|E
60|$|Felipe {{took the}} {{commission}} that the collector handed to him. He gazed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> open <b>window</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sea for a moment, with his customary expression of deep but vain pondering. Then he turned without having spoken a word, and walked swiftly away <b>through</b> <b>the</b> hot sand of the street.|$|R
60|$|The {{sunlight}} was streaming <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> when <b>at</b> last my pen {{ceased to}} move. I rubbed {{my eyes and}} looked out in momentary amazement. Morning had already broken across the sea. My green-shaded lamp was burning with a sickly light. The moon had turned pale and colourless whilst I sat at my desk.|$|R
50|$|On {{arrival at}} the aircraft, the rescue {{personnel}} did not immediately attempt to open any of the aircraft doors as the two wing-mounted engines were still running. These were shut down three minutes and 15 seconds after the aircraft came to a stop. No external fire was visible at this time, but flames were observed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rear of the aircraft. Twenty-three minutes after engine shutdown, the R2 door (second door on the right side) was opened by ground personnel. Three minutes later, the aircraft burst into flames, and was consumed by fire. Autopsies were conducted {{on some of the}} non-Saudi nationals, including the American flight engineer. All perished from smoke inhalation and not burns, which indicated that they had died long before the R2 door was opened.|$|R
