5|$|The central figure's {{mouth is}} {{positioned}} directly on its neck, {{rather than on}} a distinct face. It bares its teeth {{as if in a}} snarl, and is blindfolded by a drooping cloth bandage—a device likely drawn from Matthias Grünewald's Mocking of Christ. <b>This</b> <b>creature</b> faces the viewer directly and is centralised by a series of converging lines radiating {{from the base of the}} pedestal.|$|E
5|$|The first Prophet in {{the mythology}} of Carnivàle is the Alpha. <b>This</b> <b>creature</b> is never {{mentioned}} in the series, but Knauf described her as a female who lived before the Flood and whose story was lost with {{the destruction of the}} Royal Library of Alexandria. The Alpha spawned the first pair of Avatara, manifestations of some higher power or House; one is Light and the other Dark. A Creature of Light and a Creature of Darkness have been born to each generation since, and unlike the Alpha, they have always been male.|$|E
5|$|The shapeshifter was {{an enigmatic}} and mysterious {{character}} in the StarCraft Universe. Very {{little is known about}} <b>this</b> <b>creature,</b> beyond the fact that the shapeshifter was in fact a Xel'Naga, and was by its own admission several thousand years old. In each case that the shapeshifter has appeared in a meaningful role the creature has assumed the form of a Terran Male. The Shapeshifter's allegiance was to the fallen Xel'Naga Amon, and accordingly its actions were to further Amon's own goals.|$|E

5|$|After {{dreaming of}} {{spectacular}} horrors, Houdini awakens {{at the bottom}} of the pit and eventually manages to free himself from the ropes. Suspecting that he is somewhere in a temple under the Great Sphinx of Giza, he travels through the dark in an attempt to find an exit, following what he believes to be a draft from outdoors. Instead, he discovers that he has actually been heading further underground, eventually falling down a flight of stairs and landing in a large ceremonial cavern. There he witnesses an army of half-man, half-animal mummies, led by the ancient Egyptian pharaohs Khephren and Nitokris, leaving offerings to a hippopotamus-sized, five-headed, tentacled beast that appears from a hole deep in the hall. As he escapes, he realizes that <b>this</b> <b>creature</b> is merely the paw of a much larger deity in whose image the Sphinx was carved. Houdini dismisses the events as a hallucination or a dream consequent of the strains of his kidnapping ordeal, despite the resemblance he sees between Khephren and his guide, Drogman.|$|E

Jill Valentine, a former Special Tactics And Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.) member, {{attempts}} to escape from Raccoon City. Nearly all of Raccoon City's citizens have been transformed into zombies by an outbreak of the T-virus, a new type of biological weapon secretly developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. On her way to the Raccoon City Police Department, Jill runs into fellow team member Brad Vickers, who is killed by a new enemy. <b>This</b> <b>creature,</b> named Nemesis, is a bio-organic weapon programmed to target surviving S.T.A.R.S. members, witnesses of Umbrella's experiments. As she evades Nemesis, Jill encounters three surviving members of the Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (U.B.C.S.): Carlos Oliveira, Mikhail Victor and Nicholai Ginovaef. Nicholai explains to Jill and Carlos that a rescue helicopter can be contacted if they manage to reach the city's Clock Tower and ring the bell.|$|E

25|$|The direct {{ancestor}} of all modern camels, Procamelus, {{existed in the}} upper Miocene and lower Pliocene. Around 3–5 million years ago, the North American Camelidae spread to South America {{as part of the}} Great American Interchange via the newly formed Isthmus of Panama, where they gave rise to guanacos and related animals, and to Asia via the Bering land bridge. Surprising finds of fossil Paracamelus on Ellesmere Island beginning in 2006 in the high Canadian Arctic indicate the dromedary is descended from a larger, boreal browser whose hump may have evolved as an adaptation in a cold climate. <b>This</b> <b>creature</b> is estimated to have stood around nine feet tall.|$|E

Before leaving for this final test, Sir Eglamour asks for twelve weeks to recuperate and the earl’s noblemen support {{him in this}} request, so it is granted. During this time, Sir Eglamour gives Christabel a child. He also gives her the magic ring that Organate of Sidon gave to him. Then he goes off to Rome, where the dragon is soon lying dead at his feet.

25|$|In Wright's {{first public}} {{demonstration}} of Spore, {{he created a}} tripedal reptilian creature in the creature editor (<b>this</b> <b>creature</b> was dubbed the Willosaur by fans, after Wright, {{and became one of}} the mascots for the game, appearing prominently in the game's first trailer.). The game then determined how a lizard with three legs and a prehensile tail should walk. Other animations of the lizard including hunting, eating, swimming, dragging objects, mating, playing a drum and dancing, all of which were procedurally generated based on the model that the player created. Wright then revealed several pre-made creatures which moved realistically, despite their exotic design: large, insectile creatures with multiple heads and six legs, Tweety Bird the SUV: a walking bird whose massive head caused it to tilt while turning, and a dog-like creature with a set of unusually branching limbs. Wright also humorously demonstrated a creature that looked like a Care Bear (claiming it would be a vicious carnivore), indicating that players could create animals similar to those found in nature or popular culture. This also applied to vehicles such as space ships, as demonstrated in the Gadgetoff video, in which Wright was seen piloting a UFO similar to the USS Enterprise.|$|E

500|$|... "Fionna and Cake" [...] was {{particularly}} successful with the {{fans of the}} series; according to Entertainment Examiner, after the episode aired, [...] "fans of the series loved the new interpretation and clamored for more Fionna and Cake". Ward has revealed that he is particularly pleased with the episode [...] "Thank You"; he elaborated, [...] "I think it's awesome that with a show called Adventure Time with Finn and Jake, we can just forget about Finn and Jake {{for a little bit}} and the network will just let us follow <b>this</b> <b>creature</b> around".|$|E
500|$|The Doctor {{refers to}} <b>this</b> <b>creature</b> {{as one of}} the [...] "Trickster's brigade"; the Trickster (Paul Marc Davis) is a {{recurring}} enemy in Doctor Who spin-off series The Sarah Jane Adventures whose modus operandi is to alter history by changing pivotal moments. Russell T Davies explicitly links the Time Beetle to this villain from Sarah Jane, and in Doctor Who Confidential, a clip from the Sarah Jane episode in which the Trickster threatens to go after the Doctor is shown. The events of this episode amount to his fulfillment of that promise.|$|E
500|$|The term tengu and the {{characters}} used to write it are borrowed from {{the name of a}} fierce demon from Chinese folklore called tiāngoǔ. Chinese literature assigns <b>this</b> <b>creature</b> a variety of descriptions, but most often it is a fierce and [...] canine monster that resembles a shooting star or comet. It makes a noise like thunder and brings war wherever it falls. One account from the Shù Yì Jì ( [...] , [...] "A Collection of Bizarre Stories"), written in 1791, describes a dog-like tiāngoǔ with a sharp beak and an upright posture, but usually tiāngoǔ bear little resemblance to their Japanese counterparts.|$|E

500|$|Creatures {{that do not}} fit {{the classic}} bird or yamabushi image are {{sometimes}} called tengu. For example, tengu {{in the guise of}} wood-spirits may be called , but this word can also refer to tengu with canine mouths or other features. The people of Kōchi Prefecture on Shikoku believe in a creature called , but this is a small childlike being who loves sumō wrestling and sometimes dwells in the water, and is generally considered one of the many kinds of kappa.

500|$|Lake monster: In mid-1877, J.H. McNeil {{was with}} many other Barnes and Co. Salt Works {{employees}} on the lake’s north shore in the evening. They claimed to have seen a large monster with a body like a crocodile and a horse’s head in the lake. They claimed this monster attacked the men, who quickly ran away and hid until morning. <b>This</b> <b>creature</b> is regarded by some to have simply been a buffalo in the lake.

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>creature's</b> {{eating habits}} can be modeled with a Markov chain since its choice {{tomorrow}} depends solely {{on what it}} ate today, not what it ate yesterday or {{any other time in}} the past.

5000|$|<b>This</b> <b>creature's</b> {{camouflage}} is {{aided by}} its movements {{as well as}} its appearance. When disturbed, it rocks gently as if caught in the breeze.

[...] It can also react with a threatening display consisting of [...] "black underwings splayed out, with large eyespots, frightening away unsuspecting predators." ...|$|R
500|$|In other cases, errors {{may have}} been wrongly {{attributed}} to Aristotle. Katrin Weigmann wrote [...] " [...] statement that flies have four legs was repeated in natural history texts {{for more than a}} thousand years despite the fact that a little counting would have proven otherwise." [...] However, the historian and philosopher of biology John S. Wilkins notes that Aristotle did not say [...] "all flies have four legs"; he wrote that one particular animal, the ephemeron or mayfly, [...] "moves with four feet and four wings: and, I may observe in passing, <b>this</b> <b>creature</b> is exceptional not only in regard to the duration of its existence, whence it receives its name, but also because though a quadruped it has wings also." [...] Mayflies do in fact walk on four legs, the front pair not being adapted for walking, so, Wilkins concludes, Aristotle was correct.|$|E
500|$|The {{creation}} of the monster took the series special effects crew approximately eleven days to implement. They created molds of guest actor Neal Huff's head and back, giving him [...] "creature eye" [...] contact lenses and covering the back foam mold with [...] "backbarbs". Eight different dentures were made of Huff's mouth to depict the character gradually losing his teeth, [...] "anything from simple teeth that match his own..., to wiggling teeth that he can start to loosen up, to ones where he's already started to lose a tooth," [...] explained Special Effects Makeup crewman Stephen Kelley. Each denture appliance took about a day to create. The {{final version of the}} creature, Kelley noted, was [...] "very exaggerated... He's got the big giant quills coming off it like a porcupine. And it's also got six nipples on it, which is part of us trying to investigate what <b>this</b> <b>creature</b> actually it is." ...|$|E
500|$|Spinosaurus {{appeared}} in the 2001 film Jurassic Park III, replacing Tyrannosaurus as the main antagonist. The film's consulting paleontologist John R. Horner was quoted as saying: [...] "If we base the ferocious factor {{on the length of}} the animal, there was nothing that ever lived on this planet that could match <b>this</b> <b>creature</b> [...] Also my hypothesis is that T-rex was actually a scavenger rather than a killer. Spinosaurus was really the predatory animal." [...] (He has since retracted the statement about T. Rex being a scavenger.) [...] In the film, Spinosaurus was portrayed as larger and more powerful than Tyrannosaurus: in a scene depicting a battle between the two resurrected predators, Spinosaurus emerges victorious by biting the tyrannosaur's neck. In the fourth film Jurassic World, there is a nod to this fight where the T-Rex smashes through the skeleton of a Spinosaurus in the climatic fight {{near the end of the}} film.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>creature's</b> {{aim is to}} {{kill all}} creatures {{including}} rabbils and the main creatures. Once killed, the Bearyena vanishes leaving 10 pieces of meat to collect. It is a large animal, having dark brown fur and black eyes. It also ages naturally and dies eventually. Occasionally, a young and friendly Bearyena will appear with its parent. This young Bearyena can be befriended.|$|R
