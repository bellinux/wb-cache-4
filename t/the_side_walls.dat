5|$|Cave 16 {{is a small}} dwelling, on a {{slightly}} higher level above cave 15. It has a cell with a bench along its right wall and a veranda, {{which leads to the}} cell through a door. <b>The</b> <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> as well {{as a part of the}} ceiling are broken.|$|E
5|$|Work {{began on}} the canal in 1763. When water was let into {{the first section of}} the canal in 1764 <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> of a lock chamber collapsed. Zacharie had to borrow money to continue. In 1766, to satisfy his creditors, he prematurely opened the canal. The water broke the banks and the {{participants}} in the ceremony had to scramble to escape. Work was halted with the canal reaching only to Saint-Romain-en-Gier. In 1768, Zacharie died penniless of a heart attack.|$|E
50|$|Pinches and splats are {{shots that}} strike <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> before <b>the</b> front wall. This often makes the ball bounce twice quickly {{to end the}} rally. Pinches {{normally}} strike <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> towards <b>the</b> front part of the court, often within {{a few inches from}} the front wall.|$|R
50|$|Note: <b>the</b> entire <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> {{opposite}} <b>the</b> {{players is}} considered the safe area. The division between <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> and <b>the</b> bottom in some pools is unclear so some guideline {{will have to be}} established.|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{existence}} of <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> of <b>the</b> towing tank, the measured hydrodynamic forces would present some discrepancies compared to the open sea results. This phenomenon is referred as <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> effect. <b>The</b> object of the present study is to investigate the parameters which determine <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> effects. <b>The</b> method {{used in the present study}} involves a 3 D panel method based on Rankine type Green function. A ship advancing in a towing tank with parallel <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> is simulated and the numerical results are validated against model test results carried out by Kashiwagi and Ohkusu (1991). The parameters including wave frequency and forward speed which determine <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> effects are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{are currently}} rarely used in copper smelting, but modern lead smelting blast furnaces are much shorter than iron blast furnaces and are rectangular in shape. The overall shaft height is around 5 to 6 m. Modern lead blast furnaces {{are constructed using}} water-cooled steel or copper jackets for the walls, and have no refractory linings in <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>walls.</b> The base of the furnace is a hearth of refractory material (bricks or castable refractory). Lead blast furnaces are often open-topped rather than having the charging bell used in iron blast furnaces.|$|E
5|$|Some scutes {{contain a}} single pore {{known as an}} {{integumentary}} sense organ. Crocodiles and gharials have these on large parts of their bodies, while alligators and caimans only have them on the head. Their exact function is not fully understood, {{but it has been}} suggested that they may be mechanosensory organs. Another possibility is that they may produce an oily secretion that prevents mud from adhering to the skin. There are prominent paired integumentary glands in skin folds on the throat, and others in <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> of the cloaca. Various functions for these have been suggested. They may play a part in communication, as indirect evidence suggest that they secrete pheromones used in courtship or nesting. The skin of crocodilians is tough and can withstand damage from conspecifics, and the immune system is effective enough to heal wounds within a few days.|$|E

The intuition would suggest that the cup must have conical or {{cylindrical}} shape, which is false. The actual minimum surface is the catenoid.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> effects on facade flames ejected from the opening (such as a window) of an under-ventilated room fire. Experiments are carried out in a reduced-scale experimental setup, consisting of a cubic fire compartment having an opening with a vertical facade <b>wall</b> and two <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> normal to <b>the</b> façade wall. By changing the distance of <b>the</b> two <b>side</b> <b>walls,</b> <b>the</b> facade flame heights for different opening conditions (width, height) are recorded by a CCD camera. It is found that as the distance of <b>the</b> two <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> decreases <b>the</b> behavior the flame height can be distinguished into two regimes characterized by the dimensionless excess heat release rate, skew 5 dotQ_ex^ast See Formula in PDF, outside the opening: (a) for the “wall fire” (skew 5 dotQ_ex^ast See Formula in PDF ≤ 1. 3), the flame height is shown to change little with decrease of <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distance as <b>the</b> dominant entrainment is from the front direction (normal to the facade <b>wall)</b> independent of <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distances; (b) for the “axis-symmetrical fire” (5 dotQ_ex^ast > 1. 3), the flame height increases significantly with a decrease in <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distance as both the entrainment from <b>the</b> two <b>side</b> directions (parallel to the facade wall) and that from the front direction (normal to the facade wall) together apply. A global physically based non-dimensional factor K is then brought forward based on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> constraint effect on the facade flame entrainment to characterize <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> effect on <b>the</b> flame height, by accounting for the dimensionless excess heat release rate, the characteristic length scales of the opening as well as <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> separation distance. <b>The</b> experimental data for different opening dimensions and <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distances collapse by using this global non-dimensional factor...|$|R

25|$|The {{building}} {{follows the}} typical cruciform plan, {{created by a}} double-height nave with a crossing situated {{just west of the}} semi-circular apse. The nave incorporates an interior balcony addition above the main entrance. Concrete pilaster masses along <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> support a concrete plate which, in turn, supports the wooden king trusses of the exposed roof construction. <b>The</b> <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> are divided into five bays of equal width by the pilaster masses. Bays 1 through 4 are punctured by attenuated, circular-arch, glazed windows of gothic proportions, and the transept is located at bay 5. All interior walls are free of ornamentation.|$|E

25|$|At 15:36 JST on 12 March, {{there was}} an {{explosion}} in the reactor building at Unit 1. <b>The</b> <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> of the upper level were blown away, leaving in place only the vertical steel framed gridworks. The roof collapsed, covering the floor and some machinery on the south side. The walls were relatively intact compared to later explosions at Units 3 and 4. Video of the explosion shows that it was primarily directed sideways.|$|E
25|$|To improve {{practicality}} further, self-levelling {{rear suspension}} and an integral load restraint system {{were added to}} the options list for the Tourer. Up to 100kg can be loaded onto the roof, which is more than rival executive cars of the time, and putting loads into the boot is made easier by the 544mm sill height. Four hinged chrome lashing eyes are fitted to the floor, and oddment stowage compartments and two recessed hooks are located in <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|E
25|$|The towers {{stand outside}} {{the width of}} the aisles, but screen two chapels located {{immediately}} behind them. The lower parts of the towers continue the theme of the outer walls, but are differentiated from them in order to create an appearance of strength. The windows of the lower storey are smaller than those of <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> and are deeply recessed, a visual indication of the thickness of the wall. The paired pilasters at each corner project boldly.|$|E

50|$|Another {{defensive}} shot is {{the high}} Z. Used when the defensive player is near the front wall, the high Z is hit ten feet high or higher into the front wall near a corner. The ball then bounces from <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> all <b>the</b> way to <b>the</b> opposite <b>side</b> <b>wall,</b> usually traveling {{over the top of}} the opponent, hitting <b>the</b> opposite <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> with spin. <b>The</b> spin will cause the ball to leave the opposite wall almost perpendicular to it. This may confuse inexperienced opponents but importantly, if very close to and parallel to the rear wall, makes for a difficult return shot.|$|R
25|$|The 1952 {{coronation}} of Queen Elizabeth II is commemorated by {{a window}} in {{the west side of}} the church, and a north-facing window is dedicated to a vicar from Merton College. There are two windows in <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> and one at the east end of each aisle. They are all similar and, though modern, probably are representative of the originals. They match the tower's belfry windows. The three windows at the west end are modern.|$|E
25|$|The main façade of the Monastery has two plain-style wings {{with the}} church in the middle. The façade of the church is a mix of styles: the portal and the rose window above were part of the {{original}} church, while the statues and the two flanking towers were added {{in the beginning of the}} 18th century. <b>The</b> <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> of the church have crenellations and the apse has eight flying buttresses to support the weight of the vault of the apse, a typical feature of Gothic architecture.|$|E
25|$|Ballgame Court. This structure, of mesoamerican features, was {{constructed}} on an enormous platform that {{extends from the}} north of the Votive Pyramid throughout the access stairway at the south slope of the court. It measures 70 by 15 metres and it displays the characteristic letter “I” shape; <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> are as wide as those of the Columns Hall (2.70 meters) and assumed a height of between three and five meters. As is the case in almost all archaeological sites in Mexico, this site has had vandalism.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{adaptive}} wall ventilated wind tunnel experiments {{was carried out}} to demonstrate the feasibility of using <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> pressure distribution as the flow variable {{for the assessment of}} compatibility with free air conditions. Iterative and one step convergence methods were applied using the streamwise velocity component, <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> pressure distribution and the normal velocity component in order to investigate their relative merits. The advantage of using <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> pressure as <b>the</b> flow variable is to reduce the data taking time which is one the major contributors to the total testing time. In ventilated adaptive wall wind tunnel testing, <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> pressure measurements require simple instrumentation as opposed to the Laser Doppler Velocimetry used to measure the velocity components. In ventilated adaptive wall tunnel testing, influence coefficients are required to determine the pressure corrections in the plenum compartment. Experiments were carried out to evaluate the influence coefficients from <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> pressure distributions, and from streamwise and normal velocity distributions at two control levels. Velocity measurements were made using a two component Laser Doppler Velocimeter system...|$|R
