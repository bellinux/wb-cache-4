40|$|Objectives: This study {{concerned}} {{the temperature and}} linear dimensional change of heat-cured acrylic resin in the two-stage processing technique for complete dentures. Methods: Thermocouples were incorporated in the acrylic resin for recording temperatures. Measurements between reference marks were made by a high-resolution digital measuring microscope.

40|$|This work {{reports a}} simple {{preparation}} method for spherical hard carbons and graphites. The phenolic resin and methylnaphthalene-derived mesophase pitch (MNMP) powders are employed as the precursor for hard carbon and graphite, respectively. The irregular-shaped precursor powders are converted to spherical carbons by first coating with fine-grained fumed silica powder and carbonizing/graphitizing under an argon atmosphere. Two characteristic features are observed in this preparation. First, among the used silica powders, only those having a hydrophobic surface group are effective for the irregular to sphere conversion. Second, the conversion takes place near the glass transition <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resin</b> and the softening {{point of the}} pitch, respectively.

40|$|On-line process {{monitoring}} and control are prerequisites for more efficient and reliable manufacture of polymer matrix composites. The cure process involves complex chemical and physical changes that must be adequately controlled to consistently produce high quality products. Of various changes that occur, the viscosity is particularly important as it influences fiber wetting, uniformity of resin distribution and consolidation of the reinforcement plies. In the usual cure cycle, the viscosity of the resin initially decreases as the <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resin</b> rises owing to the higher temperature of the autoclave and heat released by the exothermic chemical reactions of the cross-linking process. Ultimately, the growing molecular weight of the polymer increases the viscosity beyond the range where flow will occur. If the resin viscosity becomes too low during this period, excess resin will seep out of the part producing an inferior product owing to resin deficiency. On the other hand, if the viscosity increases too fast the flow may be insufficient to achieve good consolidation of the plies...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Substantially more {{attention}} has been given in the past to shape memory alloys and shape memory ceramics than to shape memory polymers because unreinforced shape memory polymers have much lower stiffness and recovery force potential than shape memory alloys and shape memory ceramics. However, when incorporated into a fiber-reinforced composite, both the stiffness and the recovery force of a shape memory polymer can be dramatically improved. This paper presents recent advances in characterizing the shape memory mechanics of a thermoset shape memory polymer resin for Elastic Memory Composite (EMC) materials. In particular, heretofore undocumented response behavior is characterized through a series of thermo-mechanical tests of a commercially available EMC resin, and a lumped parameter model is adapted to accurately correlate this behavior. Through application of this model, it appears that the molecular transition associated with the shape memory effect occurs at a temperature other than the glass transition <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resin...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} stability of chip-underfill composite materials was modeled {{as a function}} of glass filler concentration between 10 and 70 wt. -%, filler particle size (between 5 and 25 microns), and the curing <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resin</b> (150 vs. 180 [*]°C), yielding different dynamic viscosity profiles. The stability was gauged using a modified sigmoidal chemorheology model for the dynamic viscosity, and incorporating the time-dependent viscosity into a model for Stokes' law of sedimentation. We also incorporated a hindered sedimentation term, due to filler concentration due to the higher loadings. Several important findings were observed. First, it appears to be the high concentration of filler that is maintaining the stability of these dispersions during cure. Smaller concentrations of the same particles were predicted to have a larger sedimentation velocity leading to stratification in the resin with time. Second, higher cure temperatures led to a shorter period of sedimentation in a pre-cured state and resulted in less sedimentation, even though there was probably a slightly smaller viscosity in the pre-cured condition. While these process models adequately describe the physics of the competitive processes of cure and sedimentation, a full picture may be incomplete without a larger determination of how this also affects polymerization shrinkage and residual shear stress upon cure...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Because of the {{advances}} in material and technology, resin transfer molding {{is used for}} fabricating advanced polymer composites. It {{has the advantage of}} simple, potential automation, and low cost. The process involves injecting reactive resin into a closed mold with preplaced fiber preform. Resin infusion process applies a vacuum to draw resin into the mold cavity for mold filling. In this study, a low cost mold of a helicopter landing gear with a bow shape was constructed. A vacuum-assisted resin infusion process was used to fabricate the landing gear. A preheater is constructed and integrated in the process to heat the resin to a specified temperature before flowing into the mold while the mold is kept at room temperature. Numerical simulation of the resin infusion process was used to study the effect of the heated resin on the filling result. An adiabatic boundary condition was used to simulate the heat transfer condition at the foam core side of the part during the filling process. During the resin infusion process, the filling pressure is lower than the atmospheric pressure and the resulting filling flow is very slow in this case. <b>Temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resin</b> will decrease quickly on entering the mold to meet the cool preplaced fiber reinforcements. However, increase of the resin temperature can reduce the viscosity and reduce the filling time.

The last part has reported on the epoxy and polypropylene composites in regard to their other thermal characteristics such as glass transition temperature (Tg) and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> TiO 2 content on these properties of epoxy and polypropylene have been studied experimentally. <b>The</b> estimation <b>of</b> effective thermal conductivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> composites using finite element method (FEM) and using the proposed theoretical models is done and the results are validated by corresponding experimental results. <b>The</b> findings <b>of</b> this research suggest that incorporation of TiO 2 into epoxy and polypropylene leads to substantial improvement in thermal conductivity and glass transition <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resins.</b> At <b>the</b> same time, TiO 2 helps in lowering <b>the</b> coefficient <b>of</b> thermal expansion of such composites. This work further shows that the FEM serves as a good predictive tool for assessment of thermal conductivity <b>of</b> these composites. <b>The</b> theoretical correlation proposed in this work can serve as a very good empirical model for spherical inclusions to estimate the effective thermal conductivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> composites within the percolation limit. With light weight and improved heat conduction capability, the TiO 2 filled polymer composites can be used for applications such as electronic packaging, encapsulations, communication devices, thermal interface material, printed circuit board substrates etc...|$|R
40|$|PMR- 15 polyimide, {{developed}} in the mid- 1970 's at the NASA Lewis Research Center, is recognized as a state-of-the-art high-temperature resin for composite applications in <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> range <b>of</b> 500 to 550 F (260 to 288 C). PMR- 15 offers easy processing and good property retention at a reasonable cost. For these reasons, it is widely used in both military and commercial aircraft engine components. Traditionally, polyimide composites have been designed for long-term use at 500 to 600 F over thousands of hours. However, new applications in reusable launch vehicles (RLV's) require lightweight materials that can perform for short times (tens <b>of</b> hours) at <b>temperatures</b> between 800 and 1000 F (425 and 538 C). Current efforts at Lewis are focused on raising <b>the</b> use <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> polyimide composites by increasing <b>the</b> glass-transition <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matrix <b>resins.</b> Achieving this {{dramatic increase in the}} upper use temperature without sacrificing polymer and composite processability is a major technical challenge...|$|R
