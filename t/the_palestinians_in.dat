5|$|As {{a public}} intellectual, Said was a {{controversial}} {{member of the}} Palestinian National Council, because he publicly criticized Israel and the Arab countries, especially the political and cultural policies of Muslim régimes who acted against the national interests of their peoples.

The presence in Lebanon {{of large numbers of}} Palestinian refugees was resented by most Christians, but Jumblatt strived to build a hard core of opposition around the Arab nationalist slogans of the Palestinian movement. Demanding a new Lebanese order based on secularism, socialism, Arabism and an abolition of the sectarian system, Jumblatt began gathering disenchanted Sunnis, Shi'a and leftist Christians into an embryonic national opposition movement.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Arafat—wanting his admired, but loud-spoken, friend {{inside the}} leading circle—reappointed al-Hout to the PLO-EC.

In response to the 1993 Oslo Accords signed by Yasser Arafat, al-Hout resigned from his post in August 1993 in the PLO-EC along with Palestinian cultural chief Mahmoud Darwish and discontinued to represent the PLO at the UNGA. Al-Hout strongly advocated that all of historical Palestine belonged to <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> <b>in</b> one state, rejecting the two-state solution agreed on in the accords.|$|E

The following year, she led her party to win a plurality of seats in the Knesset, but was again blocked from becoming prime minister, due to the rightist parties' majority in the Knesset. Consequently, she served as Leader of the Opposition from 2009, until her resignation from the Knesset in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Hussein {{decried the}} morale of those in his {{generation}} who sought to simply make a living instead of fighting for their rights. However, he did not blame this perceived submissiveness and aimlessness solely on the Arab youth themselves, but to {{the environment in which}} they grew up, with many having lived through the Nakba ("the Catastrophe"), the term used for the Palestinian exodus {{as a result of the}} establishment of Israel, and the ensuing 1948 Arab-Israeli War. According to Hussein, the neighboring Arab states reacted to the Palestinian Arab calamity by replacing their old leadership. However, in the case of <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> <b>in</b> Israel, the old leadership was restored to control the Arab community on behalf of the state.|$|E
25|$|The {{security}} {{of these resources}} is impacted by riparian conflicts. Several hundred million cubic meters of groundwater in the West Bank Mountain Aquifer are disputed between Israel and the Palestinians. Under the 1995 Interim Agreement {{as part of the}} Oslo Peace Process Israel provided 52 million cubic meters of water to <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> <b>in</b> 2011, but prevents them from drilling new wells in the Mountain Aquifer. The surface water of the Jordan River remains disputed with Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians. Only with Jordan was Israel able to reach an agreement on the sharing of water resources in 1995 as part of the Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty. 48 million cubic meters of water per year were provided to Israel under the Peace Treaty in 2011.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{throughout}} West Beirut, Amal {{continued to}} suppress the remaining predominately Sunni, pro-Palestinian militias such as the small Nasserite Sixth of February Movement in June 1986. The PLO was also aided by Lebanese-Kurdish fighters from the Kurdish Democratic Party – Lebanon (KDP–L), who lived with their families alongside <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> <b>in</b> the refugee camps. Many leftist Lebanese-Kurdish militants joined Palestinian guerrilla movements during the 1975-76 Lebanese civil war, and these militiamen now fought to protect their homes from Amal, as well as supporting their Palestinian comrades. The situation began to cool on 24 June 1986, when the Syrians deployed some of their Commando troops, assisted by a special task-force of 800 Lebanese Army soldiers and Gendarmes from the Internal Security Forces.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his term, Netanyahu {{was opposed}} by the {{political}} left wing in Israel and lost support from the right because of his concessions to <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> <b>in</b> Hebron and elsewhere, and due to his negotiations with Arafat generally. Netanyahu lost favor with the Israeli public after a long chain of scandals involving his marriage and corruption charges. In 1997, police recommended that Netanyahu be indicted on corruption charges for influence-peddling. He was accused of appointing an attorney general who would reduce the charges and prosecutors ruled that there was insufficient evidence to go to trial. In 1999, Netanyahu faced another scandal when the Israel Police recommended that he be tried for corruption for $100,000 in free services from a government contractor; Israel's attorney general did not prosecute, citing difficulties with evidence.|$|E
25|$|The 1995 Oslo II Accord allows <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> <b>in</b> the West Bank {{the use of}} up to 118 {{million cubic}} meters (mcm) water per year. 80 mcm was {{supposed}} to come from to drill new wells. However, the PWA was able to drill new wells for only 30 mcm {{at the expense of the}} existing springs and wells. In the Oslo II Accord, the Israelis are allotted four times the Palestinian portion or 80% of the joint-aquifer resources. However, 94% (340 mcm) of the Western Aquifer was allotted to the Israelis for use within Israel. The allowed quantities have not been adapted after the end of the supposed five years interim period. The parties established the Joint Water Committee to carry out the provisions of the concerning article 40 of Annex III.|$|E

25|$|Ron Prosor, Israel's {{representative}} to the United Nations, claimed in General Assembly debate on the Question of Palestine, November 2014, that the UN is illogical and tends to lack of sense of justice {{when it comes to}} the case of Israel. He claimed that the UN's focus was solely on Israel, ignoring the thousands murdered and expelled in the Middle East under the tyranny of Radical Islam, and that the Arab–Israeli conflict was never was about the establishment of a Palestinian state but the existence of the Jewish state. He also claimed that the UN is not for peace or the Palestinian people but simply against Israel, and pointed out that if the UN really cared about the situation of the Palestinians, they would have taken at least one decision regarding the situation of <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> <b>in</b> Syria and Lebanon, where Palestinians are being persecuted and systematically discriminated against.|$|E
25|$|In a video titled “The Truth About the West Bank” {{released}} by the Israeli foreign ministry in June 2011, Ayalon presents a historical narrative meant to help wage the public diplomacy battle about Israel’s ongoing conflict with <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians.</b> <b>In</b> the video made in cooperation with StandWithUs, which {{is very similar to}} one released earlier by the Yesha council, the organization of the Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Ayalon asks viewers to stop referring to the West Bank as “occupied territories”. “It is time for Israel to return to a ‘rights-based diplomacy’ and talk about the facts, rights, history and international law which are little known but give a dramatically different viewpoint to what is currently accepted,” he said after the video’s release. After the video was posted online, Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian Authority’s top negotiator, denounced the video as a “falsified account of history and international law”, but refused to participate in a public debate on the issues raised in the video proposed by Ayalon.|$|E
25|$|The Coastal Aquifer is {{the only}} source of water in the Gaza strip. It runs beneath the coast of Israel, with Gaza {{downstream}} {{at the end of the}} basin. With the water flows underground mainly east-west, however, Palestinian extractions from the aquifer have no effect on the Israeli side. Israel, on the contrary, has installed a cordon of numerous deep wells along the Gaza border and in this way extracts much of the groundwater before it can reach Gaza. Israel sells a limited part of the water to <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> <b>in</b> Gaza. While Israel transports water from the north of its territory to the south, the Palestinians are not allowed to move water from the West Bank to Gaza. This is a reason why this aquifer is heavily over-exploited, resulting in seawater intrusion. The aquifer is polluted by salt as well as nitrate from wastewater infiltration and fertilizers. Only 5-10% of the aquifer yields drinking water quality. By 2000, the water from the Coastal Aquifer in the Gaza region was considered no longer drinkable due to high salinity from the sea water intrusion and high nitrate pollution from agricultural activity.|$|E
