25|$|The {{music of}} Canada has {{reflected}} the multi-cultural influences {{that have shaped}} the country. Indigenous, the French, and <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>have</b> all made historical contributions to the musical heritage of Canada. The country has produced its own composers, musicians and ensembles since the mid-1600s. From the 17th century onward, Canada has developed a music infrastructure that includes church halls; chamber halls; conservatories; academies; performing arts centres; record companys; radio stations, and television music-video channels. The music has subsequently been heavily influenced by American culture because of its proximity and migration between the two countries. Canadian rock has had a considerable impact {{on the development of}} modern popular music and the development of the most popular subgenres.|$|E
25|$|In November 1914, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>had</b> {{occupied}} Basra.

25|$|The battle had {{a number}} of {{strategic}} implications also. Not only did the difficulty that <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>have</b> in relieving the garrison serve to boost the morale of the Boers, which had been flagging due to earlier reverses, but the act of doing so drew forces away from cordon that was being set up by the British to capture Christiaan De Wet, who subsequently managed to escape through the Magaliesberg. The fighting would continue and over a year later, on 17 September 1901, another battle was fought along a different Elands River at Modderfontein farm in the then Cape Colony, where a Boer force under Smuts and Deneys Reitz overwhelmed a detachment of the 17th Lancers and raided their camp for supplies.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{attempts}} were made by Joseph Joffre, Sir Douglas Haig, Ferdinand Foch and the army commanders Henry Rawlinson and Émile Fayolle to co-ordinate joint attacks, which failed due to {{the recovery of the}} German 2nd Army from the disorganisation caused by the defeats in early July, disagreements over tactics by Haig and Joffre in July and August and organisational constraints, caused by congestion behind the front, roads and tracks obliterated by Anglo-French artillery-fire becoming swamps when it rained and increasing German artillery-fire on targets behind the front line. Inexperience, unreliable machinery, guns, ammunition and an unpredictable flow of supplies from Britain, reduced the effectiveness of the British armies. Difficulty in co-ordinating attacks by the Allied armies and the large number of piecemeal attacks resorted to by <b>the</b> <b>British,</b> <b>have</b> been criticised as costly failures and evidence of muddle and incompetence by Haig and Rawlinson. The French Sixth and Tenth armies had similar difficulties and severe strain had been put on the German 2nd and 1st armies, forcing them into a similar piecemeal defence.|$|E
25|$|In a November 1943 {{report to}} Congress, President Roosevelt said of Allied {{participation}} in reverse Lend-lease:...the expenditures {{made by the}} British Commonwealth of Nations for reverse lend-lease aid furnished to the United States, and of the expansion of this program so as to include exports of materials and foodstuffs for the account of United States agencies from the United Kingdom and the British colonies, emphasizes the contribution which the British Commonwealth has made {{to the defense of}} the United States while taking its place on the battle fronts. It is an indication {{of the extent to which}} <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>have</b> been able to pool their resources with ours so that the needed weapon may be in the hands of that soldier—whatever may be his nationality- who can at the proper moment use it most effectively to defeat our common enemies.In 1945–46, the value of Reciprocal Aid from New Zealand exceeded that of Lend-Lease, though in 1942–43, the value of Lend-Lease to New Zealand was much more than that of Reciprocal Aid. Britain also supplied extensive material assistance to American forces stationed in Europe, for example the USAAF was supplied with hundreds of Spitfire Mk V and Mk VIII fighter aircraft.|$|E

500|$|The central {{argument}} in the letter is that <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>have</b> negated {{the rights of the}} Irish people by relying on a completely British system to pass the patent without allowing the Irish Parliament a say.

Not only were Chirac's comments considered unsportsmanlike where the normal etiquette is not to criticize rival cities, there were two IOC members from Finland who would vote in the final ballot. While Paris was widely acknowledged as the front runner, the narrow loss to London led many to believe that Chirac's comments were at fault.|$|E

500|$|Brosnan left Ireland on 12 August 1964 and was {{reunited with}} his mother and her new husband, William Carmichael, now living in the Scottish village of Longniddry, East Lothian. Carmichael took Brosnan to see a James Bond film for the first time (Goldfinger), at the age of 11. Later moving back to London, Brosnan was educated at Elliott School, a state {{comprehensive}} school in Putney, southwest London, now known as Ark Putney Academy. Brosnan has spoken about the transition from Ireland to England and his education in London; [...] "When you go to a very large city, a metropolis like London, as an Irish boy of 10, life suddenly moves pretty fast. From a little school of, say, seven classrooms in Ireland, to this very large comprehensive school, with over 2,000 children. And you're Irish. And they make you feel it; <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>have</b> a wonderful way of doing that, and I had a certain deep sense of being an outsider." [...] When he attended school, his nickname was [...] "Irish".|$|E
500|$|Staunton {{has been}} a {{controversial}} figure ever since his own time. In the words of chess journalist Mark Weeks, [...] "Staunton represents a unique challenge to chess history. Many players immediately associate his name with Paul Morphy, as in 'Staunton ducked a match with Morphy'.... This is extremely unfair, as it concentrates the focus on Staunton to a relatively minor, factually controversial incident, while it ignores his significant achievements." [...] As chess historian Edward Winter writes, [...] "The issue of national bias does, unfortunately, require consideration in the Staunton–Morphy affair." [...] Chess historian Dale Brandreth makes a similar point, from an American perspective: [...] "the fact is that <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>have</b> always had their 'thing' about Morphy. They just can't seem to accept that Staunton was an unmitigated bastard in his treatment of Morphy because he knew damned well he could never have made any decent showing against him in a match." [...] However, Frederick Edge (1830–82) and Philip W. Sergeant (1872–1952), two of Staunton's harshest critics, were British, while former world champion Bobby Fischer (1943–2008), {{one of the biggest}} fans of both Staunton and Morphy, was American.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the early}} 19th century, warfare was {{changing}} and fifes {{were no longer}} practical as combat signaling devices, being gradually replaced by the infantry bugle. They were still used as signaling (as opposed to musical) instruments by American units during the Civil War, but were gradually phased out by the 1880s. A similar evolution occurred in the British Army. The US Marines were the last American units to drop fifers from their rolls. However, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>have</b> an unbroken tradition of using fife and drum corps attached to their regiments, with whom they still parade regularly. Germany also continued an unbroken tradition of fife and drum corps {{until the end of}} World War II. They were integral to the regular German Army, Air Force and Navy, and not merely part of the Hitler Jugend and the Nazi Party organizations.
