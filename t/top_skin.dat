50|$|The outer skins: If the {{sandwich}} is supported on both sides, and then stressed {{by means of}} a downward force {{in the middle of the}} beam, then the bending moment will introduce shear forces in the material.

The thicker the core material the stronger the composite. This principle works in much the same way as an I-beam does.|$|E

5000|$|The ring-repique is a {{percussion}} instrument {{originated in}} Brazil. It's a small drum commonly made of aluminum, {{and unlike the}} Hand-repique, has two drumheads (top and bottom, commonly made out of animal skin), and a different, much deeper timbre. In Brazil this instrument is used mainly to play Samba and its variants, such as Pagode. The ring-repique has this name because traditionally, the musician wears one or more rings to play it, striking {{the body of the}} instrument with his fingers and using his thumb to play on the bottom or top skins. Normally the free hand hits the <b>top</b> <b>skin,</b> and this technique allows the player to perform more than one rhythm.

50|$|The {{shearing}} {{machines are}} {{worked on the}} principle of a horse clipper; there is a comb with slightly elevated teeth, made of steel, the knife works {{on the top of the}} comb; a three horsepower engine will work 16 machines in the following manner:—There is a shaft running the whole length of the shearing floor, about 7 feet from the ground. At each shearers stand there is a wheel(which turns the machinery) that is connected with the knife. This part is above the shearers head, and a leather pipe, about an inch in diameter, incloses a piece of sheep gut, which gives the knife 1600 revolutions a minute. There is a universal joint in the handle of the machine, and any one can soon learn to use it. There is a handle at the wheel of each of the driving machines, by which the shearing machine is put in or out of gear. A shearer catches a sheep and brings it to his stand; he then pulls the handle and his machine is ready. With two or three cuts he has the brisket clean, he then runs the machine across the belly, cleans the hind legs and round the tail; then up the neck and round the head, finishes the neck, down shoulder and side, and over backbone, then down the other side, and stops the machine, and lets the sheep go. The machine runs through the wool quite easily. It is just guided to any part, and goes round the ears the same as down the side; you can shear either very close, or can leave wool on by altering the comb. They are made in several thicknesses; in cold parts it is a great advantage to leave a little wool on the sheep. A careful man with the machine will never cut a sheep. The only way they are cut is from a broken comb, or when shearing, letting the skin get in a wrinkle, which sometimes gets through the teeth of the comb, but the cut is only the <b>top</b> <b>skin.</b> Then the wool is splendidly taken off; there is not a break in the fleece all over. Even thin-woolled old ewes—which the best hand-shearer could not shear without breaking the fleece across the back—are done just the same as heavy woolled sheep.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{tends to}} study the {{observed}} piercing force of sandwich panels with foam cores under impact loading by numerical and analytical methods. For this purpose, numerical models are built using LS-DYNA and calibrated with the inversed perforation test instrumented with an instrumented pressure bar on the AlSi 7 Mg 0. 5 Aluminum foam core sandwich panels with 0. 8 mm thick 2024 T 3 Aluminum top and bottom skins. Actually, the proposed numerical model can predict piercing force vs. displacement curves in good agreement with experimental measurements (tests at impact velocities at 27 and 44 m/s). More confidence is obtained {{by the fact that}} the simulation can also reproduce the failure mode of the <b>top</b> <b>skin</b> and bottom skin. Virtual tests using this numerical model are conducted with higher impact velocities up 200 m/s. A continuous increase of the piercing force of <b>top</b> <b>skin</b> with impact velocity is found. A careful analysis of numerical results (difference between top and bottom skin perforation, stress level beneath the <b>top</b> <b>skin,</b> etc.) shows that the foam core strength enhancement due to shock front propagation is responsible for this piercing force increase under impact loading. Finally, an analytical model using an improved RPPL shock model based on a power law densification assumption is proposed to calculate the <b>top</b> <b>skin</b> piercing forces. This analytical model provides a prediction in good agreement with the experimental and FE results in a large range of impact velocities...|$|E

40|$|Corrosion {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a serious problem in the maintenance of aging aircraft. The Industrial Materials Institute (IMI) has explored the use of laser-ultrasonics {{for the detection of}} hidden corrosion in metallic lap joint structures. For inspection with painted surfaces, IMI has shown that a resonance spectroscopy approach using a simple two-layer model can be used to determine the thickness of the paint layer and of the <b>top</b> metal <b>skin.</b> Validation of the model has been made using a test sample with a broad range of paint thickness. Once combined with a numerical inversion method, the model is used to produce a thickness map of the <b>top</b> metal <b>skin</b> from measured resonance frequencies. Results from standard samples with flat-bottom holes showed that the laser-ultrasonic technique could detect metal loss below 1 %. The reliability of the method was also demonstrated on accelerated corrosion samples. Comparison to X-ray images showed that the laser-ultrasonic method presented a thickness map that had the same accuracy as the X-ray system without the need for dismantling the sample. These results indicated that laser-ultrasonics could be a useful tool not only to inspect aircraft during routine maintenance but also to provide valuable data in the study of corrosion inception and growth in lap joint structures.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to find the pattern of skin diseases in our patients attending university-affiliated dermatologic clinics in the Qassim region. Methods : We conducted a prospective study of all Saudi patients attending the Qassim University Medical College-affiliated dermatology clinics of the Ministry of Health for a period of 12 months from 1 March 2008 to 28 February 2009. Results : The study included 3051 patients comprising 1786 (58. 5 &#x 0025;) males and 1265 (41. 5 &#x 0025;) females. Males outnumbered females (P <. 05) (male-to-female ratio, 1. 4 : 1). The mean age (standard error of the mean) of the patients was 25. 3 (0. 27) years. About 71 &#x 0025; of the patients were between 5 and 34 years of age. The <b>top</b> five <b>skin</b> diseases were eczema/ dermatitis (19. 5 &#x 0025;), viral infections (16. 6 &#x 0025;), pilosebaceous disorders (14. 4 &#x 0025;), pigmentary lesions (11. 2 &#x 0025;) and hair disorders (7. 6 &#x 0025;). The major disorder in males was viral skin infections (20. 0 &#x 0025;), while eczema/dermatitis (20. 7 &#x 0025;) constituted the most prevalent skin disease in females. Seasonal variations were recorded in cases of pigmentary lesions, papulosquamous disorders and protozoal infections. Conclusion : Infectious skin diseases, eczema/dermatitis, pilosebaceous disorders, pigmentary lesions and hair disorders ranked as the <b>top</b> five <b>skin</b> diseases.
