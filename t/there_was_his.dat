5|$|MercyMe {{was formed}} in 1994 by vocalist Bart Millard, guitarist Mike Scheuchzer, and keyboardist Jim Bryson. The band later brought on drummer Robby Shaffer and bassist Nathan Cochran. In October 1999, the band {{released}} their fifth independent album, The Worship Project. The album proved successful, selling over 60,000 copies within a year, but the difficulty of selling albums directly, {{in addition to having}} to book and manage for themselves, led the band to pursue a contract with a record label. Millard was directed by a friend to contact Jeff Moseley, who had connections in the Christian music industry, for advice. After being contacted by Millard, Moseley expressed interest in the band, and within a week MercyMe was officially signed to INO Records, a new record label Moseley was helming. Moseley introduced the band to Pete Kipley, who would produce the album. Although Kipley had been involved on some minor projects, Almost <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> first major project.|$|E

By doing so, Romanos interrupted a six-century old tradition, whereby almost all the Byzantine emperors since Constantine I were buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles.|$|E
500|$|John Bradley Hirst, [...] (9 July 1942 – 3 February 2016) was an Australian {{historian}} and commentator. He has [...] {{been described as}} an [...] "historian, public intellectual, and active citizen". Born in Adelaide, Hirst attended Unley High School and undertook his undergraduate and postgraduate study at the University of Adelaide. Abandoning an early desire to become a Methodist Minister, in 1968 he was appointed a [...] lecturer at Melbourne's new La Trobe University, where he remained {{until the end of}} his career. His wife and fellow-student Christine accompanied him to Melbourne. They had two children, Catherine and David. Hirst was subsequently head of department and Reader in History at La Trobe. He retired in 2006, and was an Emeritus Scholar at La Trobe until his death. Hirst had a distinguished career [...] "in teaching, supervision and research. He developed new subjects and methodologies to teach them. In addition to those concerning Australian history <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> pioneering subject designed to inform students about Australia's European cultural heritage." [...] This work was published as The Shortest History of Europe and has been translated into nine languages (Swedish, Greek, Chinese,Arabic, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish and Korean). Hirst was seconded to the University of Melbourne to edit Historical Studies, Australia's leading historical journal, from 1977 to 1980. In retirement, he travelled regularly to Sydney to instruct, without remuneration, groups of post-graduate students in thesis writing.|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{would say}} two reasons. One was Pantridge himself. He is a {{remarkable}} personality who is very persuasive. He can persuade people to do things, and [...] [...] [...] actually make them enjoy doing things {{that he has made}} them do because they are successful. So <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> tremendous enthusiasm behind the system. Then there {{was the fact that the}} layout of the [...] hospital was flat and it was quick and easy to get to people and resuscitate them. I didn't realize this at the time, but I subsequently visited hospitals in various parts of England. They had slow elevators and so on, and you could never move around the hospital quickly with any kind of emergency apparatus." ...|$|E
2500|$|Morris left Princeton in 1972, enrolling at Berkeley as a Ph.D. {{student in}} {{philosophy}}. At Berkeley, he once again {{found that he}} was not well-suited to his subject. [...] "Berkeley was just a world of pedants. It was truly shocking. I spent two or three years in the philosophy program. I have very bad feelings about it," [...] he later said. He became a regular at the Pacific Film Archive. As Tom Luddy, the director of the archive at the time, later remembered: [...] "He was a film noir nut. He claimed we weren't showing the real film noir. So I challenged him to write the program notes. Then, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> habit of sneaking into the films and denying that he was sneaking in. I told him if he was sneaking in he should at least admit he was doing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|He started 1930 well by {{finishing}} runner-up in the Champion Stakes at Wimbledon on 1 January {{and then}} won the Spring Cup at Wembley on 22 March. He then won the Derby again {{in front of}} 50,000 spectators including King Alfonso XIII of Spain. His victory <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> eleventh in succession. Mick then won the Cesarewitch at West Ham and the Welsh Greyhound Derby at the Sloper Road Stadium, setting the world record again, this time at 29.55seconds over [...] His run extended nineteen successive victories before he tore a shoulder muscle in a race at Wimbledon Stadium. During the run, he broke world records on four occasions and newspaper editors stopped using the headline of [...] "Wonder Dog", instead replacing it with simply [...] "Invincible". He finished the year winning 20 times from 23 races.|$|E

2500|$|It was at {{that stage}} that he began collaborating with Almanahul Literar, a newly founded {{magazine}} edited by communist poet Miron Radu Paraschivescu, which, in 1954, was renamed Steaua. Among his early assignments <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> participation on the literary jury that granted the magazine's annual prize (alongside literary men such as Paraschivescu, Emil Isac, Dumitru Micu and Iosif Pervain). In one notable incident of 1950, the panel honored {{a high school student}} named Ion Motoarcă, without being aware that Motoarcă's communist poetry was in fact a parody of Socialist Realist literature, authored as a prank by Baconsky's rival Doinaş. As was revealed decades later, Doinaş continued to ridicule the Steaua writers over several months, and, when he decided that the risk of repercussions was far too great, simply {{put an end to the}} prank. This he did by having Motoarcă decline all of Baconsky's suggestions with the claim that one [...] "should not take lessons from a less gifted poet than himself." [...] In parallel, Anatol E. Baconsky's relationship with Paraschivescu was tense: in February 1951, at a USR meeting in Bucharest, he was one of those who criticized Baconsky's new take on lyric poetry, accusing him of [...] "intimism".|$|E
