This mode encourages players to work together, as teammates can help each other or they can assassinate their targets simultaneously. The Advanced Alliance mode is a variant of Alliance mode, however the players' compasses as well as target engagement becomes more difficult, similar to the Advanced Wanted mode.|$|E
25|$|The {{anterior}} cingulate cortex activity increases when errors {{occur and}} are being monitored as well as having behavioral conflicts with the self-concept {{as a form of}} higher-level thinking. A study was done to test the prediction that the left frontal cortex would have increased activity. University students had to write a paper depending on if they were assigned to a high-choice or low-choice condition. The low-choice condition required student to write about supporting a 10% increase in tuition at their university. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> condition was to see how significant the counterchoice may affect a person's ability to cope. The high-choice condition asked students to write in favor of tuition increase as if it was their choice and that it was completely voluntary. EEG was used to analyze students before writing the essay as dissonance is at its highest during this time (Beauvois and Joule, 1996). High-choice condition participants showed a higher level of the left frontal cortex than the low-choice participants. Results have shown that the initial experience of dissonance can be apparent in the {{anterior cingulate cortex}}, then the left frontal cortex is activated, which also activates the approach motivational system to reduce anger.|$|E

The lottery principle is less accepted these days because of evidence that asexual reproduction is more prevalent in unstable environments, the opposite of what it predicts.|$|E

2500|$|J.B. Miles {{contradicts the}} idea that free will has prosocial benefits, {{recognizing}} that many distinguished minds have already brought up the negative effects that such a belief would ensure. [...] The explanation for the commonality of this mix-up {{is a lack of}} knowledge regarding the free will debate in psychological research. Miles analyzed the methods of popular studies and concluded that such research purported to be examining associations between behavior and disbelief in free will are actually examining the associations between behavior and belief in fatalism. While evidence of the negative effects of a belief in fatalism is legitimate, the research fails to study the effects of belief on free will which they claim to discuss. [...] This occurrence is due to an incorrect understanding and implication that fatalism accompanies determinism. Fatalism is distinguished by {{the idea that}} decisions lack effect on the future because everything is determined. [...] Conversely, determinism is the belief that everything operates under cause and effect; every action determines a reaction. [...] Determinism, therefore emphasizes the importance and responsibility one has in decision making as every choice will have an accompanying effect. [...] Seeing this flaw throughout commonly cited research, Miles presents countering research which includes “evidence that the myth of free choice encourages immoral, unjust, prejudiced, and anti-intellectual behaviour.” [...] Miles suggests that while both extremes of fatalism and belief in free will result in negative social outcomes, determinism serves to encourage intentional, prosocial decision making. Ultimately, <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> research is to encourage accurate knowledge of the free will debate when conducting and evaluating such studies in experimental psychology.|$|E
