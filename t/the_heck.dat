5|$|The tarpan was a Eurasian {{wild horse}} that became extinct {{in the wild}} in 1879, due to hunting and {{crossbreeding}} with domesticated horses, and in 1887 the last captive horse died in Russia. <b>The</b> <b>Heck</b> horse {{was created by the}} German zoologist brothers Heinz Heck and Lutz Heck, director of the Berlin Zoo, at the Tierpark Hellabrunn (Munich Zoo) in Germany in their attempt to breed back the tarpan. The Hecks believed they could recreate the extinct tarpan subspecies by back breeding living descendants. They believed they could combine and rearrange the genetic material from these living descendants into a recreation of the extinct horse. Other breeders had the same idea, and used different genetic stock to attempt to recreate the tarpan or a reasonable look-alike. One result was a line of horses bred from American Mustangs by a breeder named Harry Hegardt.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Heck</b> {{brothers}} bred together several European small {{horse and}} pony breeds hypothesized to be {{descended from the}} tarpan. They eventually integrated mares of the Konik, Icelandic horse, and Gotland breeds. These mares were bred to stallions of a wild horse type known as Przewalski's horse. The Hecks believed the wild Przewalski blood would help to draw out the wild characteristics they felt lay dormant in the domesticated pony breed mares. The initial crosses were made between Gotland and Icelandic mares (who visually closely resembled the tarpan, especially {{in the shape of}} the head) and Przewalski's horse stallions (who provided the desired dun coloration and upright mane), and the offspring were then bred to each other. The first foal born from the program who had the desired coloration was a colt born on May 22, 1933 at the Tierpark Hellabrunn. The breeding program continued, using only those horses who showed the desired skull shape, bone structure and coloration. Relatively quickly, the breed's conformation and coloration became set, with parents reliably passing their characteristics onto their offspring.|$|E

25|$|The Miles M.15 {{was built}} in {{response}} to Air Ministry specification T.1/37 which called for a two-seat basic trainer. Two other aircraft manufacturers also built contenders: Parnall Aircraft provided <b>the</b> <b>Heck</b> 3 and Heston Aircraft their Heston T.1/37. The Airspeed AS.36, General Aircraft GAL.32 and Percival P.20 were also proposed against specification T.1/37, but not built. At first sight, the M.15 looked rather like the earlier Miles Magister, a low cantilever wing monoplane with tandem open cockpits and a fixed, spatted main undercarriage plus tailwheel, powered by a single inverted de Havilland Gipsy series in-line engine. Despite this, the two types differed significantly in powerplant, form and construction.|$|E

500|$|During World War II, horses of {{the desired}} type were taken from German-occupied {{countries}} {{to use in the}} Hecks' breeding program. Tadeusz Vetulani, a Polish biologist, had been working with Konik horses, at that point believed to be descended from tarpans, with the goal (like <b>the</b> <b>Hecks)</b> of recreating <b>the</b> tarpan. Some of the horses from his program had been reintroduced to the forests of Białowieża, Poland. During <b>the</b> war, <b>the</b> <b>Hecks</b> removed <b>the</b> animals from the forest and used them in their own breeding programs. Vetulani considered this a [...] "baffling campaign of destruction", and the Hecks' actions effectively ended his breeding program. Some of <b>the</b> resulting <b>Heck</b> horses, closely resembling tarpans, were sent back to Białowieża, to become part of a hunting preserve for Nazi government officials. The land, and the horses, were returned to Polish management after the war ended. As of 2007, a small herd of the horses remained, living with little interference from humans, in Białowieża Forest, Europe's last remaining area of primeval lowland forest. <b>The</b> <b>Hecks</b> had conducted a similar breeding program in hopes of recreating the aurochs, resulting in what would become Heck cattle.|$|R

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Heck</b> {{horse is}} a horse breed that is claimed to {{resemble}} the tarpan (Equus ferus ferus), an extinct wild equine.

Although unsuccessful at creating a genetic copy of the extinct species, they developed a breed with grullo coloration and primitive markings. After the Nazi invasion of Poland, they were introduced to the Białowieża Forest, where a small herd still survives. Heck horses were subsequently exported to the United States, where a breed association was created in the 1960s.|$|E
