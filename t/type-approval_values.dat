40|$|In-use fuel {{consumption}} data of 924 passenger cars (611 petrol, 313 diesel) {{were collected from}} various European sources and were evaluated in comparison to their corresponding <b>type-approval</b> <b>values.</b> The analysis indicated that the average in-use {{fuel consumption}} was higher than the type-approval one by 11 % for petrol cars and 16 % for diesel cars. Comparison of this dataset with the Travelcard database in the Netherlands showed that the deviation increased for late model years and in particular for cars with low <b>type-approval</b> <b>values.</b> The deviation was higher than 60 % for vehicles registered in 2012 within the 90 - 100 gCO 2 /km bin. Unrealistic vehicle resistances used in type-approval were identified {{as one of the}} prime reasons of the difference. A simplified linear model developed in the study may be used to predict in-use fuel consumption based on data publicly available. The model utilizes the fuel consumption measured in type-approval, the mass, and the engine capacity to provide in-use fuel consumption. This may be either used to correct fuel consumption factors currently utilized by emission models (e. g. COPERT, HBEFA, VERSIT+, and others) or could be used independently to make projections on how fuel consumption may develop on the basis of changing future passenger cars characteristics. JRC.

40|$|Since 2008 Travelcard Nederland BV and TNO {{collaborate}} {{to determine}} the real-world fuel consumption of modern vehicles. The difference between the official <b>type-approval</b> <b>value</b> and the actual fuel consumption has been reported over the years (Ligterink, 2010 and Ligterink, 2013 and Ligterink, 2014). The fact that both numbers do not coincide is not surprising, since the official typeapproval test for determining fuel consumption does not properly represent the real-world vehicle usage. However, the increasing gap between both numbers is remarkable. From year to year, the <b>type-approval</b> <b>value</b> decreases with new vehicle models. The real-world fuel consumption, on the other hand, is only slightly lower. Also for the same <b>type-approval</b> <b>value</b> the real-world fuel consumption is higher with newer vehicles...|$|R
40|$|The Dutch {{national}} transport CO 2 emissions {{are determined by}} summing individual cases: a particular vehicle, on a particular road and traffic situation. In this paper the different aspects and the relations among them, as used in emission predictions, are outlined. In particular the central role that the CO 2 <b>type-approval</b> <b>value</b> (from the NEDC test) plays in the real-world CO 2 emissions since 2000 is clarified.
