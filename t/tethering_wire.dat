The goal of the rocket program has been to perform a new type of active experiment by ejecting an electron beam from the tethered mother-daughter payload system. In the third and fourth rocket flights, the conductive <b>tether</b> <b>wire</b> was deployed more than 400 m.

50|$|Pekka Janhunen from FMI has {{invented a}} type of solar sail called the {{electric}} solar wind sail. Mechanically it has {{little in common with}} the traditional solar sail design. The sails are replaced with straightened conducting <b>tethers</b> (<b>wires)</b> placed radially around the host ship. The wires are electrically charged to create an electric field around the wires. The electric field extends a few tens of metres into the plasma of the surrounding solar wind. The solar electrons are reflected by the electric field (like the photons on a traditional solar sail). The radius of the sail is from the electric field rather than the actual wire itself, making the sail lighter. The craft can also be steered by regulating the electric charge of the wires. A practical electric sail would have 50-100 straightened wires with a length of about 20 km each.|$|R

40|$|A new {{percutaneous}} annuloplasty {{technique for}} mitral regurgitation is proposed here. In this technique, inter-related anchors are first inserted around the annulus via a trans-septal catheter. The <b>tethered</b> <b>wire</b> {{passed through the}} anchors is then pulled to shrink the annulus and stop regurgitation. The anchors should withstand large deformation, applied during the delivery process, and should recover their original shape after being released inside the tissue. The shape of the anchors is, thus, optimized in an iterative process, to avoid stress concentration by minimizing the weighted rms value of the curvature along the anchor. The weight coefficients in each iteration are defined based on the stress distri-bution of the anchor obtained in the previous iteration. The procedure finally results in a structurally optimum anchor with a minimum in the maximum von Mises stress. This anchor is fabricated from Nitinol and tested in a cadaveric swine heart.

40|$|A report {{discusses}} {{a proposal}} to use large, lightweight solar sails embedded with electrodynamic tethers (essentially, networks of wires) to (1) propel robotic spacecraft to distant planets, then (2) exploit the planetary magnetic fields to capture the spacecraft into orbits around the planets. The purpose of the proposal is, of course, {{to make it possible}} to undertake long interplanetary missions without incurring the large cost and weight penalties of conventional rocket-type propulsion systems. Through transfer of momentum from reflected solar photons, a sail would generate thrust outward from the Sun. Upon arrival in the vicinity of a planet, the electrodynamic tethers would be put to use: Motion of the spacecraft across the planetary magnetic field would induce electric currents in the <b>tether</b> <b>wires,</b> giving rise to an electromagnetic drag force that would be exploited to brake the spacecraft for capture into orbit.

40|$|The {{electric}} {{solar wind}} sail (E-sail) is a space propulsion concept {{that uses the}} natural solar wind dynamic pressure for producing spacecraft thrust. In its baseline form, the E-sail consists {{of a number of}} long, thin, conducting, and centrifugally stretched tethers, which are kept in a high positive potential by an onboard electron gun. The concept gains its efficiency {{from the fact that the}} effective sail area, i. e., the potential structure of the tethers, can be millions of times larger than the physical area of the thin <b>tethers</b> <b>wires,</b> which offsets the fact that the dynamic pressure of the solar wind is very weak. Indeed, according to the most recent published estimates, an E-sail of 1 N thrust and 100 kg mass could be built in the rather near future, providing a revolutionary level of propulsive performance (specific acceleration) for travel in the solar system. Here we give a review of the ongoing technical development work of the E-sail, covering tether construction, overall mechanical design alternatives, guidance and navigation strategies, and dynamical and orbital simulations...|$|R
40|$|Power {{and thrust}} {{applications}} of the electrodynamic tether are considered. The induced voltage in the <b>tether</b> <b>wire</b> {{is in the same}} direction {{in the case of a}} power generator and a spacecraft motor, and the difference involves whether one allows that voltage to drive a current to generate power. Or, if one uses an onboard power supply with a higher voltage to drive a current in the opposite direction, which then provides thrust. Return circuit currents must be spread out through the ionosphere sufficiently so that ionosphere conductivities are very high and so that anomalous resistance is not produced in the ionosphere which would prevent the current from flowing. This is largely a function of the plasma contactors that are used. Three have been most frequently considered. It is concluded that, for the primary power and thrust applications, the hollow cathode seems to be far superior to the electron gun for producing high current contact to the ionosphere. This has led to a study of the Plasma Motor Generator (PMG) because it is capable of being reversed.

40|$|In {{anticipation}} of the upcoming TSS- 1 experiment, theoretical calculations are made of radiated power from a conducting tethered satellite system. The radiation results from the steady motion of the system through the ionospheric plasma and it is stimulated by collection and emission of charge by the noninsulated surfaces of the tethered end connectors. A model of the current system is developed which incorporates the <b>tether</b> <b>wire,</b> satellite surfaces, and sheath currents. The radiation impedance of the current model is calculated using the previously developed theory of Barnett and Olbert (1986). The results confirm the low-frequency Alfven wave description with a predicted radiation impedance of a few tenths of an ohm in the Alven wave limit. Calculations are also made in the lower hybrid and whistler wave band. A larger impedance of about 13 ohm is found for the frequency range 5 - 50 kHz. By estimating the passive ion current drawn by the system a prediction of the total radiated power is also made. The result of 0. 38 mW {{raises the question of}} whether or not wave emissions from a passive current collecting system may be detectable by either ground- or space-based platforms...|$|R

The wire connections attached to these rigid electrodes, floating in a very soft medium like neural tissue, not only damage the surrounding cells from forces but also limit the longevity of the implant due to wiretethering breakage in chronic implants. Wireless transfer of stimulus energy as well as the pulse parameters to a floating electrode or an array of electrodes has gained interest in recent years as a method to eliminate the associated problems with <b>tethering</b> <b>wires.</b> Considering the properties of the neural tissue, different types of energy transfer mechanisms have been proposed for energizing the implant wirelessly: electromagnetic radio-frequency (RF), optical, and. Theacoustic waves implanted electrode(s) {{may or may not have}} active electronics for storing the pulse parameters. Active devices also require an energy storage mechanism for powering the circuit. On the other hand, passive devices that can instantaneously convert the incident energy into the electric stimulus do not need to store energy or require programming, often maximizing the stimulus energy and implantation depth. The enthusiasm for replacing wired stimulators with wireless versions is primarily motivated from the complications that arise from tethering forces associated with the micromotions of the electrode assembly, the risk of infection from percutaneous connections, and the failures from wire breakage. Additionally, with passive versions of the wireless devices, the electrode needed for housing the electrode contacts and the connecting wires is no longer needed,shan...|$|R

To this end electrodynamic tethers have been proposed as {{a viable alternative to}} conventional propulsion. Aside from a de-orbit system electrodynamic tethers have a wide range of applications as a power generator or propulsion system being ideally suited to orbital environments having strong magnetic fields for example Jovian orbits. Previous experiments performed in the development of electrodynamic <b>tethers</b> used insulated <b>wire</b> <b>tethers</b> and separate current collection devices, either large passive spheres or active plasma contactors. The subject of this thesis is to design and size an electrodynamic tether experiment for use onboard the Delfi- 1 University satellite. The main objectives of the experiment are to provide a proof of concept of bare electrodynamic tether propulsion and deploy and operate a tape tether. A tape tether design has been selected having a favourable geometry for current collection and survivability in the micrometeoroid and orbital debris environment in comparison with ‘traditional’ <b>wire</b> <b>tethers.</b> The tape tether also has favourable drag properties allowing for a rapid deorbit when cut from the main satellite decreasing the risk of collision with operational satellites. A secondary objective for the experiment is to determine if the release of a neutral gas can enhance the current of the tether and the deorbit performance. This experiment is fundamental {{in the development of a}} fully passive deboost capability for tether equipped systems. The limited amount of storage and mass, power and data rate available when using a micro-satellite platform for the experiment combined with low complexity and cost requirements inherent to the Delfi- 1 project drives the design to a bare minimum required for performing the primary scientific objectives.

40|$|An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is a robot {{that can}} travel {{underwater}} without requiring any intervention from the operator. As opposed to AUV, Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) is an underwater robot which requires manual control through a <b>tethered</b> <b>wire</b> {{connected to a}} base ship or a station. AUV finds tremendous applications {{in the field of}} defense, underwater mine detection, study of ocean floor, repair of undersea cables and is also pursued as a hobby. For an automated vehicle to travel from point A to point B, requires three interrelated technologies: Navigation, Guidance and Control. This thesis mainly focuses on the Navigation aspect of the AUV. Inertial Navigation System (INS) use accelerometers and gyroscopes to measure acceleration and attitude (orientation) rates respectively to estimate position, velocity and attitude in three orthogonal directions. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) uses a cluster of satellites to estimate the position of GNSS receiver close {{to the surface of the}} earth. INS gives accurate short term navigation solutions yet its accuracy diminishes overthe long run because of accumulation of errors. The precision of GNSS navigation solution is not so good when contrasted with INS but they don't corrupt over the long run. When these two navigation systems are fused or integrated using a Kalman filter, the subsequent system performs better than either of the individualsystems even when sensors of lower cost and lower performance are used. One disadvantage of using GNSS is that the GNSS signals are lost whenever the AUV dives inside the water. But by using an integrated GNSS/INS system, an INS is allowed to navigate with improved initial error even when GNSS signals are lost, thus achieving the desired standalone performance. Moreover, whenever the GNSS signals are available, the system utilizes the INS data to decrease the signal reacquisition time for GNSS. Thus each system supports the other system to achieve the desired performance. The thesis focuses on the design and implementation of Kalman filters for these applications. First of all, dynamic model and sensor error model for strapdown INS has been developed. The effectiveness of the model was studied using Schuler oscillation test, bias error test and stationary INS test. Next, an error model for GNSS has been developed. Subsequently, various vi types of vehicle dynamic model for GNSS receivers has been developed and its error characteristics were compared using a simulated Figure‐ 8 track (track in the shape of 8). Finally, performance analysis of INS, GNSS and integrated GNSS/INS is studied on a Figure‐ 8 simulated track. Effect of loss of GNSS signals on the performance is also studied. ...|$|R

These needs are well docu-mented in the recent National Academy of Sciences Decadal Surveys. There is significant interest in developing revolutionary propulsion techniques that will enable such Heliopause scientific missions to be completed within 10 to 15 years of the launch date. One such enabling propulsion technique commonly known as Electric Sail (E-Sail) propulsion employs positively charged bare <b>wire</b> <b>tethers</b> that extend radially outward from a rotating spacecraft spinning at a rate of one revolution per hour. Around the positively charged bare-wire tethers, a Debye Sheath is created once positive voltage is applied. This sheath stands off of the bare <b>wire</b> <b>tether</b> at a sheath diameter that is proportional to the voltage in the wire coupled with the flux density of solar wind ions within the solar system (or the location of spacecraft in the solar system. The protons that are expended from the sun (solar wind) at 400 to 800 km/sec are electrostatically repelled away from these positively charged Debye sheaths and propulsive thrust is produced via the resulting momentum transfer. The amount of thrust produced is directly proportional to the total wire length. The Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Electric Sail team is currently funded via a two year Phase II NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) awarded in July 2015. The team's current activities are: 1) Developing a Particle in Cell (PIC) numeric engineering model from the experimental data collected at MSFC's Solar Wind Facility on the interaction between simulated solar wind interaction with a charged bare wire that can be applied to a variety of missions, 2) The development of the necessary tether deployers and tethers to enable successful de-ployment of multiple, multi km length bare tethers, 3) Controllability of the space-craft via a voltage bias to steer itself through the solar system to destinations of discovery.

The motion control problems of an AUV can be of different types such as path following, trajectory tracking, waypoint tracking and also localization. The thesis first develops path following control of a single AUV using the Serret- Frenet(S-F) frame approach and error backstepping technique. Later on the same back- stepping approach has been extended for implementation of formation control for multiple AUVs. Out of various motion control strategies, this thesis mainly focusses on path following control problem of a single AUV. To address this problem of path following, a virtual frame is considered. This virtual moving frame is called the S-F frame. The purpose of using S-F frame is to represent the AUV kinematics in terms of virtual frame parameters. Then a suitable control strategy has been developed which generates appropriate thruster force and rudder orientation enabling the AUV to follow the desired path. In the thesis, the path following controller has been developed using the concept of error backstepping method. In the developed controller it is also shown that the path following error i. e. distance between virtual frame and AUV actual frame approaches to zero and it is also ensured that other states of the AUV remain stable and bounded. Although error backstepping approach has been employed for path following problem but the earlier work [1] has not considered the surge motion dynamics and coupling of rudder angle. Therefore, this thesis has addressed the limitation of [1] and developed the backstepping controller considering the rudder coupling term. Although using a single AUV has many advantages but in case of its failure, the com- plete mission may be affected. Further, the area coverage by an individual AUV is limited. Thus, multiple AUVs are deployed for achieving a co-operative operation. Co-operative working of multiple AUVs obviate the aforesaid disadvantages as the group of AUVs in co-operative motion provides robustness in case of an individual AUV failure. Recently, a lot of research has been directed on developing cooperative motion control of multiple AUVs. Co-operative motion control can be achieved through different control strategies such as Leader-Follower, Virtual Based structure and Behavior Based Formation Con- trol. These cooperative control strategies have their own advantages and disadvantages. Hence, these strategies have been reviewed and in this work, the concept of S-F together with error backstepping approach have been exploited to develop formation control of multiple AUVs. A fuzzy logic controller has also been implemented for deriving the con- trol algorithm for leader-follower formation control scheme applied to control a group of AUVs. Subsequently, the thesis presents a graphical simulation environment using VRML and SIMULINK 3 D to visualize the effect of controllers developed in providing the desired path following and formation control activities of AUV(s). This graphical simulation accepts the AUV states as inputs and represents the motion in an oceanic environment. Also a proposal on hardware set up design of a single AUV is presented in the thesis. The selection of necessary sensors, actuators and various electronics components for the AUV hardware have been presented...|$|R
