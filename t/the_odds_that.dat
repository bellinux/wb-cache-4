25|$|Typically {{there was}} not much social mobility. It was possible, however, over several generations for a family to slowly move up the social ladder. For example, A wealthy {{merchant}} or artisan could sometimes attract a wife from an impoverished but aristocratic family. This would bring the merchant/artisan social standing and bring his wife and her family needed finances. The wealthier the family, the greater <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>that</b> they would marry their children off to wealthy families from neighboring towns. This would increase the family influence beyond that of the local village or town. On {{the lower end of the}} social spectrum, occasionally a free farmer with a sufficient dowry for his daughter could attract an artisan to marry her. This kind of strategic marriage could sometimes be used to accomplish social mobility in as little as 2-3 generations. Sometimes the opposite occurred and families would move down the social ladder due to disgrace or financial calamity. In general though, families married within and stayed within their social class for hundreds of years.|$|E

2500|$|After World War II, {{the major}} powers built heavy {{strategic}} bombers to carry nuclear weapons. By the 1960s, however, advances in ground-based radar, guided missiles, radar-guided anti-aircraft guns, and fighter planes greatly decreased <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>that</b> bombers could reach their targets, whether they used the traditional high-altitude or newer low-altitude approach. One 1964 study of British V bombers estimated that a bomber that did not use chaff or other countermeasures would encounter an average of six missiles, each with a 75 percent chance of destroying its target. The study thus stated that [...] "the bomber will not always get through", and advocated Britain emphasize the Polaris submarine missile instead. For similar reasons, the United States Navy deployed Polaris submarines during that decade. At that time, it shifted aircraft carriers away from delivering strategic nuclear weapons to a role suited for both general nuclear and limited non-nuclear wars. The United States Air Force found converting its large fleet of manned bombers to non-nuclear roles more difficult. It attempted to redesign the B-70 Valkyrie high-altitude supersonic bomber project as a platform for reconnaissance and launch of standoff missiles such as the Skybolt; however, Skybolt was cancelled in 1962 after testing failures. A 1963 study stated [...] "Long-range technical considerations, of course, militate against the perpetuation of the manned bomber".|$|E
2500|$|Smaller-scale {{public events}} of Stoker's own time {{also play a}} role the novel. [...] One of the detectives working to find Marjory notes that one of the kidnappers was {{probably}} involved in the A.T. Stewart ransom case. A.T. Stewart was an immigrant who came to America from Belfast in 1818. He became a millionaire working in the dry-goods business, but after his death, his body was stolen from its tomb in 1878. The original people arrested for the crime were not actually the perpetrators, and the body was never found. Scholar Lisa Hopkins points out that this case is an [...] "ominous" [...] one for Stoker to reference while the men in the novel are searching for Marjory because it involved a corpse rather than a living person and the mystery was never quite solved. [...] Hopkins also indicates some notable parallels to Dracula when Lucy has become a vampire and is [...] "able to escape from a locked tomb". [...] All of this, according to Hopkins, creates [...] "a powerful atmosphere of the uncanny" [...] and [...] "a sense of <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>that</b> are stacked against the novel's hero". The fact that the Stewart case proved too much for even the Pinkerton Detective Agency to solve also could be an opportunity for Stoker to detract from [...] "the American reputation for efficiency" [...] and thus [...] "incriminat Marjory".|$|E
