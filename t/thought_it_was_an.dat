5|$|Development began {{shortly after}} the release of Christmas Nights in November 1996. Producer Yuji Naka wanted to create a game which {{involved}} saving people rather than killing them. Sonic Team chose to connect the game with firefighting as they <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> effective way of having players identify with heroism. Burning Rangers received mostly positive reviews. Critics unanimously commended the game's soundtrack and audio, with the voice navigation system receiving particular praise. The response to the graphics was mixed, with some critics asserting that it had the best visuals on the Saturn, although it was noted for its poor collision detection and occasional glitching. The game was among the final five Saturn titles released in America.|$|E

25|$|The {{incident}} was largely met with disbelief and {{laughter from the}} passengers {{and some of the}} flight attendants, as they <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> exercise. Passengers described two of the hijackers as calm and with a good comprehension of Swedish, while one was clearly nervous and did not understand Swedish. The hijackers calmly answered questions regarding the action and stated that they intended to have the ambassador's murderer released. They then started making references to the Munich massacre ten days earlier and hinted that a similar situation could arise in the aircraft. Passengers described the hijackers as generally friendly.|$|E

25|$|Police {{initially}} <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> accidental gas explosion, but {{hours later}} believed the explosion {{was caused by}} stockpiled explosives accidentally going off. A Moroccan man was injured in the explosion and taken to the hospital, he is to be questioned by police. The explosive TATP and 120 canisters of butane and propane were found inside the house. Catalan bomb squads carried out a controlled explosion at the property where the gas canisters were stored. There was speculation that the terrorists intended to take trucks loaded with explosives and combustible gas to attack the Sagrada Família.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{is often}} stated that he sighted the {{peninsula}} {{for the first time}} on March 27, 1513 and <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> island, he probably saw one of the Bahamas at that time. He went ashore on Florida's east coast during the Spanish Easter feast, Pascua Florida, on April 7 and named the land La Pascua de la Florida. After briefly exploring the land south of present-day St. Augustine, the expedition sailed south to the bottom of the Florida peninsula, through the Florida Keys, and up the west coast as far north as Charlotte Harbor, where they briefly skirmished with the Calusa before heading back to Puerto Rico.|$|E
25|$|On 4 April 2011, a fire {{broke out}} on a Di 8 {{locomotive}} at Kløfta on the Trunk Line while hauling a 16-wagon train of jet fuel to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. The fire started in an electrical cabinet after a diesel pipe running over it had cracked. The fire fighting was complicated by the train dispatcher not wanting to disconnect the overhead wire power as he <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> electric train. The damages were so severe that the locomotive was scrapped. The Accident Investigation Board Norway criticized CargoNet for not having sufficient maintenance routines for diesel pipes, as they were neither part of the maintenance procedure nor where there specified intervals for replacement.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} coup that deposed Castillo {{took place on}} June 4, 1943. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> considered {{the end of the}} Infamous Decade and the starting point of the Revolution of '43. Arturo Rawson took power as de facto president. The nature of the coup was confusing during its first days: German embassy officials <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> pro-Allied coup and burned their documentation, while the United States embassy <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> pro-Nazi coup.|$|R
50|$|Bonaparte and Novas placed Abelisaurus in {{the newly}} created family Abelisauridae in 1985. They <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> member of the Carnosauria. Abelisaurus was the first abelisaurid named.|$|R

25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics {{in the press and}} Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E
500|$|... "The Same Old Story" [...] first {{aired in}} the United States on September 16, 2008 on Fox. An {{estimated}} 13.272 million viewers watched the episode, a 45 {{percent increase from}} the series premiere. The episode received mixed reviews from television critics – reviewers <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> improvement from the previous episode but faulted it for containing plot contrivances.|$|E
500|$|... "When I got {{the song}} and the lyrics, I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> {{incredible}} song... And, to me, {{it turned out to}} be a country song, when we got our instrumentation on it and everything. And some people go, 'Well, why in the world would you do a pop song?' I just think music is music. You've got good and you've got bad, and I try to stay on the good side." ...|$|E

500|$|Stephen James Walker, {{a writer}} of {{reference}} works on Doctor Who, included an extensive analysis and review of the episode in his [...] "unauthorised guide to Doctor Who's fourth series", Monsters Within. Walker attributed the episode's origin as an allusion to other prominent alternate history works, such as It's a Wonderful Life and Sliding Doors, and applauded {{the mention of the}} Trickster as an [...] "unexpected but welcome cross-franchise reference". He was surprised that the format of a [...] "companion-lite" [...] episode followed by a [...] "Doctor-lite" [...] episode had not been attempted before because he <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> [...] "ideal compromise".|$|E
500|$|While a large {{majority}} of critics praised the main trivia storyline, many reviews criticized the Dwight and Robert plot. McNutt wrote that, [...] "As the trivia storyline was building momentum, the Florida storyline was killing that same momentum, a push-and-pull that the trivia ended up winning." [...] Forcella explained that [...] "the titular storyline of the gang playing 'Trivia' in Philadelphia worked really well, but the forced trio in Florida definitely did not." [...] Jill Mader from InsidePulse.com wrote, [...] "All in all, I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> inconsistent episode – I liked the trivia storyline, but the Dwight stuff really fell flat for me." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Phoebe Green was {{considered as a}} recurring role, but this episode ended up being her only appearance. Chris Carter explained the character's origins, saying [...] "I thought {{it was interesting to}} show a little bit of Mulder's history by bringing an old girlfriend back. I've always wanted to do a Scotland Yard detective who was a woman. I also <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> interesting chance to use Amanda Pays and make a villainess of her". Executive producer Robert Goodwin felt that the episode [...] "was a hard one. Any kind of a fire stunt is a major undertaking, because it involves so many overlapping things. It was a major feat, a real logical and creative feat, because you wanted it to look good".|$|E
2500|$|In this 1914 {{game between}} World Champion Emanuel Lasker and Siegbert Tarrasch, Black {{exchanged}} down into this position because he <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> win, but White used the maneuver above {{to draw the}} game.|$|R

In the same month a Pew Research poll {{surveyed}} support for changing Medicare and found that 41 percent of Americans opposed it while 36 percent supported it. The Pew {{poll found that}} the more Democrats and Independents were {{made aware of the}} plan were more likely to oppose it; Republicans were more supportive the more they heard about it. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 31 percent of Americans <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> bad idea while 22 percent <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good idea.|$|R
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the outbreak, many did not believe that the disease existed. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> lie (invented) to collect money because at that moment I hadn´t seen people affected in my community." ...|$|R
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched Star Trek: The Next Generation {{after the}} end of the series. Keith DeCandido for Tor.com thought that the plot was predictable, {{describing}} Riker being written as [...] "so paint-by-numbers the color is practically dripping off the screen". He praised the relationship between Q and Picard, stating that de Lancie was having such [...] "fun with the role that the episode itself is also fun despite its flaws". He gave [...] "Hide and Q" [...] a score of five out of ten. Zack Handlen re-watched the episode for The A.V. Club, and <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> example of where TNG avoided characterisation in favour of a morality play. He thought that the episode was a mess, with the highlights being Picard reciting Shakespeare and the Napoleonic monsters. He rated the episode as a C-.|$|E
500|$|The media showed {{concern over}} the film's title, deeming it [...] "odd", and some people were shocked because of the title, which can be {{translated}} into English as [...] "mean". However, the makers said that [...] "kaminey" [...] is not a negative term and is actually a term of endearment. According to Bhardwaj, {{the idea for the}} title came from a scene from Gulzar's Ijaazat (1987), in which the lead actor (Naseeruddin Shah) refers to the actress in a loving manner; {{it was the first time}} that he heard the word used that way. Bhardwaj told Rediff, [...] "when the script of this film was written, it was like discovering your own mean side. The format of the film is of a caper and all the characters in this film, excluding one, has an agenda. So I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> apt title for the film".|$|E
500|$|Connie Smith's {{sound is}} defined by the Nashville Sound musical style, {{primarily}} during her breakthrough years in the 1960s. While most Nashville Sound recordings of the time mainly included full orchestras, Smith's sound remained more traditional with its use of steel guitar and her twangy vocals, while still featuring some pop-influenced instrumentation to provide urban pop appeal. Critics have largely praised Smith's use of the steel guitar, which have often been described as [...] "sharp" [...] and [...] "prominent". Smith's steel guitar player Weldon Myrick is often credited with creating what Smith has called [...] "The Connie Smith Sound". In an interview with Colin Escott in his book Born to Sing, Myrick recalls how Smith's producer (Bob Ferguson) wanted the guitar to sound, [...] "He came out and said he wanted a bright sound, and he adjusted my controls. I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> awfully thin sound, but it wound up being very popular." ...|$|E
500|$|Jeremy Davies, {{who plays}} Daniel Faraday, said [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> remarkably well-written and brilliantly {{conceived}} story. I was quite knocked out by it {{on a lot}} of levels." [...] He called it [...] "remarkable storytelling." ...|$|R
50|$|Everybody Loves Ice Prince {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics who <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> generally good album, {{but did not}} live up to the hype surrounding it, seeing as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the most anticipated Nigerian release of 2011.|$|R
50|$|Reasons for loss: Brent {{was very}} {{concerned}} about the tone of their promo (based on 50 Shades of grey) and whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> indeed family friendly. He also <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little bit controversial for such a brand.|$|R
500|$|Cavendish, in 1766, was {{the first}} to {{distinguish}} hydrogen from other gases, although Paracelsus around 1500, Robert Boyle (1670), and Joseph Priestley (?) had observed its production by reacting strong acids with metals. Lavoisier named it in 1793. Carl Wilhelm Scheele obtained oxygen by heating mercuric oxide and nitrates in 1771, but did not publish his findings until 1777. Priestley also prepared this new [...] "air" [...] by 1774, but only Lavoisier recognized it as a true element; he named it in 1777. Daniel Rutherford discovered nitrogen while he was studying at the University of Edinburgh. He showed that the air in which animals breathed, after removal of exhaled carbon dioxide, was no longer able to burn a candle. Scheele, Henry Cavendish, and Priestley also studied this element at about the same time; Lavoisier named it in 1775-6. Scheele obtained chlorine from hydrochloric acid, but <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> oxide. Only in 1808 did Humphry Davy recognize it as an element.|$|E
500|$|In early 1998, the Red Hot Chili Peppers fired guitarist Dave Navarro {{and were}} on the verge of {{breaking}} up. Flea told Kiedis, [...] "the only way I could imagine carrying on [...] is if we got John back in the band." [...] With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> appropriate time to invite him back. When Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band, Frusciante began sobbing and said [...] "nothing would make me happier in the world." [...] With Frusciante back on guitar, the Chili Peppers began recording their next album, Californication, released in 1999. Frusciante's return restored a key component of the Chili Peppers' sound, as well as a healthy morale. He brought with him his deep devotion to music, which affected the band's recording style during the album. Frusciante has frequently stated that his work on Californication was his favorite.|$|E
500|$|Mohammed M'Barek {{expressed}} {{frustration with}} the French authorities that had kept him [...] "in prison for two-and-a-half years for nothing". He <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> outrage that the French regarded the dumping of an inconveniently dead body in a ravine as a crime. He {{even went so far}} as to appeal to the new French president Nicolas Sarkozy for justice. On the third day of the trial, the courtroom descended into chaos as Monsieur M'Barek burst into tears then jumped to his feet pointing at Shaftesbury's family. He attempted to blame the Ashley-Cooper family for the peer's death, claiming that they were the guilty ones. [...] "You're the guilty ones, you the rich, who want to take his inheritance!" [...] he shouted as police wrestled with him in the dock. After refusing requests from his lawyer and the judge to sit down and be quiet, M'Barek was taken down to the cells and the hearing temporarily adjourned.|$|E
2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> {{possible}} that the SABC <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> 2-day match, but Wisden 1911 clearly states that [...] "not <b>a</b> ball could <b>be</b> bowled on the first and fourth days" [...] so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> actually planned as a 4-day match.|$|R
