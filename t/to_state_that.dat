5|$|Teller became {{controversial}} in 1954 when he testified against Oppenheimer at Oppenheimer's security clearance hearing. Teller had clashed with Oppenheimer many times at Los Alamos over issues relating both to fission and fusion research, and during Oppenheimer's trial {{he was the}} only member of the scientific community <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> Oppenheimer should not be granted security clearance.|$|E
5|$|After Tucker {{is accused}} of murdering James Woods, he reveals that Woods talked him out of auditioning for the lead role in the 1984 hit horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street.

Diane Simmons also goes on <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> Woods had promised to introduce her to former CBS news anchor Dan Rather, but ultimately ended up introducing her to actor and comedian Danny Bonaduce instead.|$|E
5|$|Establishment {{and support}} of cadet battalions and rifle clubs, with the caveat that no funding could be {{provided}} out of the Parliamentary grant in respect of any person {{under the age of}} sixteen. This caveat was a compromise introduced on the third reading of the bill; the Commons had provided that no support could be given for a person under sixteen at all, and the Lords wished to remove this restriction. The compromise was <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> no support could come from Parliamentary funds, but the associations were effectively free to raise money themselves for this purpose.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{references}} to the Redbone community and its members in 19th century newspapers tend to be wildly divergent, ranging from making no mention of racial makeup, <b>to</b> <b>stating</b> <b>that</b> the members were white, <b>to</b> <b>stating</b> <b>that</b> the members were African American <b>to</b> <b>stating</b> <b>that</b> the members were of Indian extraction to the assertion that the members were of unspecified mixed race.

The book in question is a scientific report in part only; it is primarily a fictional account of my experiences in New Guinea and owes its origin to the unusual circumstances prevailing in Germany {{at the time of}} my return. Some of the journeys I had actually undertaken are not described at all; on the other hand it contains passages that do not correspond with the facts.|$|E

Thio Li-ann has commented that when important constitutional rights such as the freedom to religion are curtailed by legislation, it may be advisable for the court to impose a duty on a public authority to give reasons establishing that an order imposed by the authority is objectively valid.|$|E
5|$|On 25 June 1656, Charles X Gustav {{signed an}} {{alliance}} with Brandenburg: the Treaty of Marienburg granted Greater Poland to Frederick William in return for military aid. While the Brandenburgian elector was free of Swedish vassalage in Greater Poland, he remained a Swedish vassal for the Duchy of Prussia. Brandenburgian garrisons then replaced the Swedish ones in Greater Poland, who went to reinforce Charles X Gustav's army. On 29 June however, Warsaw was stormed by John II Casimir, who had drawn up to Charles X Gustav with a force of 28,500 regulars and a noble levy of 18,000 to 20,000. Thereupon, Brandenburg actively participated {{in the war on}} the Swedish side, prompting John II Casimir Vasa <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> while his Tartars already had the Swedes for breakfast, he would now take Frederick William into custody, where neither sun nor moon would shine.|$|E

5|$|On November 29, 1820, the Assembly {{chartered}} the Bank of the Commonwealth, {{another source}} from which debtors could obtain money. Creditors {{did not want}} to accept payment from either the Bank of Kentucky or the Bank of the Commonwealth; the notes of the former were depreciated {{due to a lack of}} capital and the latter had no capital and no guarantee of state credit. In December 1820, the Assembly modified the replevin law <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> creditors who would accept payment in notes from the Bank of the Commonwealth but not the Bank of Kentucky would be forced to wait three months to collect on a debt. The wait was one year if the creditor accepted only notes from the Bank of Kentucky, and it remained two years for creditors who would not accept notes from either.|$|E
5|$|Since the Medal of Honor was established, 19 {{recipients}} {{have received}} it twice, of whom 5 received both awards during World War I. These 5 men were all Marines who received both the Army and Navy {{versions of the}} Medal of Honor for the same action. This {{was made possible by}} the practice of attaching some units of the U.S. Marine Corps, a part of the Department of the Navy, to larger U.S. Army commands, making Marines in such units eligible for both Army and Navy decorations. Of the other three Marines who earned the Medal of Honor during World War I, two were awarded only the Navy version and one, Fred W. Stockham, received only the Army version. In February 1919, the criteria for the award were amended <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> no person could receive more than one Medal of Honor, thus precluding any future double recipients.|$|E
5|$|The Blitz changed everything. In September 1940 the Luftwaffe flew 6,135 night sorties, {{leading to}} only four combat losses. The Dowding system was {{incapable}} of handling night interceptions in a practical manner, and Dowding continued <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> the only solution was to get AI into operation.

5|$|The Kurma Purana goes on <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> {{after the}} {{encounter}} with the sages of the Deodar Forest, Bhikshatana continued to wander, visiting various countries of gods and demons before he finally reached the abode of the god Vishnu. Vishnu's gatekeeper Vishvaksena did not allow him to enter. Angered, Bhikshatana slew Vishvaksena and impaled the corpse on his trident, which added to his sin. This form of Shiva with a corpse on his trident is called Kankala-murti ("One with the skeleton"). Bhikshatana, now as Kankala-murti, entered Vishnu's abode and begged for food. Vishnu offered his own blood as food in one version. In another version, Vishnu cut an artery on Bhikshatana's forehead; a stream of blood spurts into his begging bowl as his food. Vishnu then directed Bhikshatana to visit the sacred city of Varanasi, where his sin would be expiated. The encounter with Vishnu's gatekeeper is also retold with some variation in the Vamana Purana and the Matsya Purana.|$|E
5|$|The NWA World Heavyweight and World Tag Team Championships were contested for in TNA {{until the}} morning of May 13, 2007. On that day, NWA's Executive Director Robert Trobich {{announced}} that the NWA were ending their five-year agreement with TNA, which had allowed them full control over both titles. Trobich went on <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> effective that morning, then-NWA World Heavyweight Champion Christian Cage and then-NWA World Tag Team Champions Team 3D were stripped of their respective championships. The alleged motivation behind these actions was because Cage refused to defend the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against wrestlers from NWA territories. That same day, TNA were scheduled to produce their Sacrifice event, in which both Cage and Team 3D were to defend their respective championships. On the card, Cage was scheduled to defend the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Kurt Angle and Sting in a match involving three competitors, {{also known as a}} three-way match.|$|E

The writer of the c.1800 manuscript went on <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> the temptation for unfurling the flag for {{the third and final}} time was always resisted; and {{that at the time of}} his writing, there was not much chance of it ever being unfurled again, since it was in such a reduced state.

5|$|The {{community}} of Big Woods was significantly affected by flooding, with 30 families being {{isolated in the}} area. The only fatality from the storm also occurred in this community after a man was washed away while trying to rescue a family. The severity of damage in Big Woods prompted Jamaica Labour Party Area Council Four chairman <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> it should be declared a disaster area. Torrential rains during a two-hour span overnight triggered most of the flooding in the area, isolating many homes and inundating several. In Westmoreland Parish, severe flooding inundated several homes and damaged roadways. One home sustained significant damage after a large tree fell on it. In Kingston, high winds damaged power lines and some homes. Water supply to most regions was cut due to damage to pipelines and high water turbidity. Widespread power outages occurred due to numerous downed trees and power lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} {{astronomer}} from antiquity known by name who supported Aristarchus's heliocentric model was Seleucus of Seleucia, a Hellenistic astronomer who lived {{a century after}} Aristarchus. According to Plutarch, Seleucus {{was the first to}} prove the heliocentric system through reasoning, but it is not known what arguments he used. Seleucus' arguments for a heliocentric cosmology were probably related to the phenomenon of tides. According to Strabo (1.1.9), Seleucus was the first <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> the tides are due to the attraction of the Moon, and that the height of the tides depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun. Alternatively, he may have proved heliocentricity by determining the constants of a geometric model for it, and by developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model, like what Nicolaus Copernicus later did in the 16th century. During the Middle Ages, heliocentric models were also proposed by the Indian astronomer Aryabhata, and by the Persian astronomers Albumasar and Al-Sijzi.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategies}} of gay activists {{were once again}} split. David Goodstein and other professional gay men paid an advertising agency to outline their message, which focused on the threat to privacy {{and the rights of}} teachers. In The Advocate, Goodstein urged gays not to live up to stereotypes and let the professionals try to win. However, grassroots efforts by longtime activists such as Morris Kight, who went on a walk across the state to promote voting down the Briggs Initiative, were also effective. Women were highly visible in the campaign, raising about {{the same amount of money}} as men. However, when California law was revealed <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> anyone who gave more than $50 to the campaign would have to release his or her name, most of the donations came in at $49, including one by Rock Hudson.|$|E

5|$|The {{two films}} most {{commonly}} compared to Greed are Huston's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and Welles' The Magnificent Ambersons. Rosenbaum believes that besides Huston's film ending with gold being {{lost in the}} desert and similarities between Trina's descent into madness with Fred C. Dobbs own obsessions, the two films have little else in common. The Magnificent Ambersons and Greed both have characters who struggle with class differences that lead to their downfall. Ambersons was famously edited down drastically by its studio and the cut footage is now lost. Rosenbaum goes on <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> Greed influenced the methods in which novels are adapted into films and filmmakers like Welles, Huston and Bill Forsyth followed von Stroheim's example by re-arranging the plot and adding new scenes to their films while still remaining faithful to {{the intentions of the}} original novels. The 1994 Jonathan Lynn film Greedy pays tribute to the film by giving the main characters the last name McTeague.|$|E
5|$|Ventus was {{designed}} by director Tetsuya Nomura who {{wanted to create a}} character with an important connection with the series' main character Sora.

After Ventus' first cameo, Nomura had <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> both of them are different characters, and the reason for such connection would be revealed in Birth by Sleep. Video game websites also commented on Ventus' first appearance, initially confusing him for Roxas during the development of Birth by Sleep, but has since been well received.|$|E
