50|$|Current {{practice}} {{is to give}} separate services for single-phase and three-phase loads, e.g., 120 V split-phase (lighting etc.) and 240 V to 600 V three-phase (for large motors). However, many jurisdictions forbid more than one class for a premises' service, and the choice may come down to 120/240 split-phase, 208 single-phase or three-phase (delta), 120/208 <b>three-phase</b> (<b>wye),</b> or 277/480 <b>three-phase</b> (<b>wye)</b> (or 347/600 <b>three-phase</b> (<b>wye)</b> in Canada).|$|E
50|$|The MIL-STD-704 power {{connections}} provide {{the store with}} access to 28 VDC, <b>three-phase</b> <b>wye</b> 400 Hz, 115/200 VAC and 270 VDC aircraft power; it is usual to route {{only one of the}} last two supplies, however, if both are made available, then they are never made active simultaneously. The MIL-STD-1760 interface provides power through the primary interface (two off 28 VDC and either one or both 115/200V VAC and 270 VDC), where it is routed to the store along with all of the other signal types. The standard also allows for an optional auxiliary power interface (1 off 28 VDC and either 115/200 VAC or 270 VDC) for stores with more demanding power requirements. The auxiliary power interface includes its own interlock discrete signals so that the aircraft can determine whether the store's auxiliary power connector is attached to the aircraft.|$|E
40|$|Proper use of phase-controlled {{switching}} technology by controlling the making or {{breaking of the}} circuit breaker (CB) at predetermined phase angles of current or voltage can improve the service life of the CB, avoid relay protection device from mal-operation, and reduce {{the impact on the}} power grid when power equipment or load is energized or taken out. This paper proposes a novel phase-controlled switching method to address the influence of residual flux for <b>three-phase</b> <b>wye</b> winding unloaded transformers with three limbs, such as large capacitor variable frequency transformer or mine explosion-proof transformer. The optimal operation phase angle for CBs is firstly obtained via theoretical analysis. A model based on the alternative transients program/the electromagnetic transients program (ATP/EMTP) is then built to simulate the transient procedure of a power transformer during breaking and making. The simulated results confirm that the proposed switching strategy can reduce the excitation inrush current effectively when the unloaded transformers are energized. The experimental results reported in this paper are used to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of the phase-controlled switching strategy. Department of Electrical Engineerin...|$|E
