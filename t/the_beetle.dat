5|$|During the Cold War the Warsaw Pact countries, {{fearing a}} food shortage, decried <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> as a CIA plot {{to destroy the}} {{agriculture}} of the Soviet Union. Officials launched a Warsaw Pact-wide campaign to wipe out <b>the</b> <b>beetle,</b> villainizing them in propaganda posters and pulling schoolchildren from class to gather the bugs and drown them in buckets of benzene or spirit.|$|E
5|$|As well as plant based poisons, {{there are}} others that are made {{that are based on}} animals. For example, the larva or pupae of a beetle genus of the Northern Kalahari Desert is used to create a {{slow-acting}} poison that can be quite useful when hunting. <b>The</b> <b>beetle</b> itself is applied to the arrow head, by squeezing the contents of <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> right onto the head. Plant sap is then mixed and serves as an adhesive. However, instead of the plant sap, a powder made from the dead, eviscerated larva can be used.|$|E
5|$|Beetle-pollinated {{flowers are}} usually large, greenish or off-white in color, and heavily scented. Scents may be spicy, fruity, or similar to {{decaying}} organic material. Beetles {{were most likely}} the first insects to pollinate flowers. Most beetle-pollinated flowers are flattened or dish-shaped, with pollen easily accessible, although they may include traps to keep <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> longer. The plants' ovaries are usually well protected from the biting mouthparts of their pollinators. <b>The</b> <b>beetle</b> families that habitually pollinate flowers are the Buprestidae, Cantharidae, Carambycidae, Cleridae, Dermestidae, Lycidae, Melyridae, Mordellidae, Nitidulidae and Scarabeidae. Beetles may be particularly important {{in some parts of}} the world such as semiarid areas of southern Africa and southern California and the montane grasslands of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} insect pests infest stored dry {{foods such as}} flour, cereals and pasta; these include the Indian mealmoth, <b>the</b> {{cigarette}} <b>beetle,</b> <b>the</b> drugstore <b>beetle,</b> <b>the</b> confused flour <b>beetle,</b> <b>the</b> red flour <b>beetle,</b> <b>the</b> merchant grain <b>beetle,</b> <b>the</b> sawtoothed grain <b>beetle,</b> <b>the</b> wheat weevil, the maize weevil and the rice weevil.|$|R
50|$|Veresina occidentalis {{can be used}} in {{the home}} garden for insect control. Verbesina occidentalis attracts <b>the</b> soldier <b>beetle.</b> <b>The</b> soldier <b>beetle</b> is {{attracted}} to the plant for two reasons. It is believed that <b>the</b> soldier <b>beetle</b> is attracted to Verbesina occidentalis due to its coloration. <b>The</b> soldier <b>beetle</b> is also yellow and can hide among the flowers. <b>The</b> soldier <b>beetle</b> will also drink the nectar from the plant. When <b>the</b> soldier <b>beetle</b> drinks <b>the</b> nectar it does not harm the plant. Both the adult and larva of <b>the</b> soldier <b>beetle</b> will prey on other insects. <b>The</b> adult soldier <b>beetles</b> will eat <b>the</b> aphids, caterpillars, grasshopper eggs and mites. The larva of <b>the</b> soldier <b>beetle</b> hatches in <b>the</b> spring. <b>The</b> larva soldier <b>beetles</b> prey upon insect eggs, larva, snails, and slugs. <b>The</b> soldier <b>beetle</b> lays its eggs in the late summer.|$|R
40|$|Both the {{cultivated}} and {{the wild}} spinach (Amaranthus species) {{have been found to}} be host to an important beetle pes t Gasteroclisus rhomboidalis. The longevity of <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> was studied under a variety of conditions. It was observed that the life span of <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> varied widely with <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> capable of leaving up to 70 days (about 42 days 0 n <b>the</b> average). <b>The</b> <b>beetles</b> generally lived longer under the ambient condition than inside room condition. Studies on the survivorship of the immature stages of <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> revealed that <b>the</b> larva has the highest mortality rate amongst stages with the egg being the highest surviving stage. Studies on the fecundity of <b>the</b> female adult <b>beetles</b> showed that about 80 % of their life span is utilised in egg laying. On the average, about 2 eggs are laid per day (i. e. about 5 eggs laid within 2 days) ...|$|R
5|$|Elsewhere in Europe, <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> became {{established}} near USA {{military bases}} in Bordeaux during or immediately following World War I and had proceeded to spread {{by the beginning of}} World War II to Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain. The population increased dramatically during and immediately following World War II and spread eastward, and <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> is now found over much of the continent. After World War II, in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, almost half of all potato fields were infested by <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> by 1950. In East Germany they were known as Amikäfer ('Yankee beetles') following a governmental claim that the beetles were dropped by American planes. In the EU it remains a regulated (quarantine) pest for the UK, Republic of Ireland, Balearic Islands, Cyprus, Malta and southern parts of Sweden and Finland. It is not established in any of these Member States, but occasional infestations can occur when, for example, wind blows adults from Russia to Finland.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} successes in the west was in controlling Icerya purchasi (cottony cushion scale) in Australia, using a predatory insect Rodolia cardinalis (the vedalia beetle). This success was repeated in California using <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> and a parasitoidal fly, Cryptochaetum iceryae.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>beetle</b> has the {{potential}} to spread to temperate areas of East Asia, India, South America, Africa, New Zealand, and Australia.|$|E
5|$|A {{second case}} occurs {{a few days}} later, another man killed by <b>the</b> <b>beetles,</b> but they find <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> to be larger and more mature. From the second victim's movements, they {{identify}} the likely culprit as Dr. Armand Silva (Alon Abutbul), a former scientist. Dr. Silva {{was working on a}} cure for avian flu using <b>the</b> skelter <b>beetle,</b> but his research was terminated with the extinction of the sheep. Fauxlivia and Frank postulate Dr. Silva may be trying to breed <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> in humans, who share similar biological features with sheep.|$|R
50|$|Coquillett placed <b>the</b> vedalia <b>beetles</b> on an infested {{orange tree}} {{enclosed}} in a tent. In a few months, <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> had multiplied prolifically and devoured the scale insects. When the tent was opened, <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> spread to adjoining trees {{and soon the}} entire orchard was free of the cottony cushion scale. As word of the dramatic results spread, citrus growers from throughout the state came to gather the insects and release them into their orchards. <b>The</b> <b>beetles</b> spread rapidly and by 1890 California was almost entirely free of the pest.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> huhu <b>beetle</b> (Prionoplus reticularis) is {{a member}} of <b>the</b> longhorn <b>beetle</b> family(Cerambycidae) and <b>the</b> largest <b>beetle</b> found in New Zealand.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>beetle</b> is {{native to}} America and Mexico and is present {{in all of the}} States of America except Alaska, California, Hawaii, and Nevada. It now has a wide {{distribution}} across Europe and Asia, totalling over 16 millionkm2.|$|E
5|$|Donna {{is taken}} to a dying TARDIS, which UNIT has managed to use as {{the core of a}} crude time machine. Rose uses energy from the TARDIS to show Donna <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> on her back, but tells her they do not know what it is. She insists that Donna travel back to the day she made the fateful turn and choose to turn left again. Donna is transported back minutes before she would make that turn, but too far away to contact her past self in time. She makes the {{decision}} to walk out in front of a passing truck and let it hit her, creating a traffic jam that causes her past self to turn left out of impatience. As Donna lies on the ground dying, Rose whispers a message into her ear for the Doctor. The alternate universe disappears, and Donna finds herself back on Shan Shen. <b>The</b> <b>beetle</b> falls off of Donna's back, and the fortune teller runs away after uttering some terrified words about what Donna will become.|$|E
5|$|L. decemlineata is {{an iconic}} species {{and has been}} used as an image on stamps because of its {{association}} with the recent history of both North America and Europe. For example, in 1956, Romania issued a set of four stamps calling attention to the campaign against insect pests and it was featured on a 1967 stamp issued in Austria. <b>The</b> <b>beetle</b> also appeared on stamps issued in Benin, Tanzania, the United Arab Emirates, and Mozambique.|$|E
50|$|Some {{species are}} {{considered}} pests when they inhabit stores of grain, flour, bread, dried fruit, and other products, however, <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> feed on fungi {{growing on the}} food product rather than the product itself. They also breed in the fungi, laying eggs in the hyphae. They are more common in products that are damp and moldy. <b>The</b> <b>beetles</b> can transmit fungal spores to products, encouraging mold growth. In Canada <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> are common in the grain-producing prairie regions.|$|R
5000|$|Skill cards {{represent}} <b>the</b> abilities a <b>beetle</b> can use. A {{player can}} only scan one skill card per skill type. Every skill card requires a certain skill point number; {{if the number}} is equal to <b>the</b> <b>beetle's</b> skill point level, {{the result will be}} a perfect compatibility. If <b>the</b> <b>beetle's</b> skill point is greater than the skill, it results in a [...] "good" [...] compatibility. If <b>the</b> <b>beetle's</b> skill point is less than the skill point of the card, it will worsen the effectiveness of the skill used by that beetle.|$|R
50|$|Rickettsiella {{bacteria}} {{is being}} researched {{as a potential}} bio-control agent to manage {{the large numbers of}} <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> affecting agricultural areas all over New Zealand. This bacterium is said to produce an ‘intracellular infection’ in <b>the</b> <b>beetles,</b> and many other members of their genus.|$|R
5|$|Mutualism is {{well known}} in a few beetles, such as the ambrosia beetle, which {{partners}} with fungi to digest the wood of dead trees. The beetles excavate tunnels in dead trees in which they cultivate fungal gardens, their sole source of nutrition. After landing on a suitable tree, an ambrosia beetle excavates a tunnel in which it releases spores of its fungal symbiont. The fungus penetrates the plant's xylem tissue, digests it, and concentrates the nutrients on and near the surface of <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> gallery, so the weevils and the fungus both benefit. The beetles cannot eat the wood due to toxins, and uses its relationship with fungi to help overcome the defenses of its host tree in order to provide nutrition for their larvae. Chemically mediated by a bacterially produced polyunsaturated peroxide, this mutualistic relationship between <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> and the fungus is coevolved.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} dung beetle, {{especially}} the sacred scarab, Scarabaeus sacer, were revered in Ancient Egypt. The hieroglyphic image of <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> {{may have had}} existential, fictional, or ontologic significance. Images of the scarab in bone, ivory, stone, Egyptian faience, and precious metals are known from the Sixth Dynasty {{and up to the}} period of Roman rule. The scarab was of prime significance in the funerary cult of ancient Egypt. The scarab was linked to Khepri, the god of the rising sun, from the supposed resemblance of the rolling of the dung ball by <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> to the rolling of the sun by the god. Some of ancient Egypt's neighbors adopted the scarab motif for seals of varying types. The best-known of these are the Judean LMLK seals, where eight of 21 designs contained scarab beetles, which were used exclusively to stamp impressions on storage jars during the reign of Hezekiah. Beetles are mentioned {{as a symbol of the}} sun, as in ancient Egypt, in Plutarch's 1st century Moralia. The Greek Magical Papyri of the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD describe scarabs as an ingredient in a spell.|$|E
5|$|The Colorado potato beetle {{was first}} {{observed}} in 1811 by Thomas Nuttall and was formally described in 1824 by the American entomologist Thomas Say. <b>The</b> <b>beetle</b> {{were collected in}} the Rocky Mountains where they were feeding on the buffalo bur, Solanum rostratum. The genus Leptinotarsa is assigned to the chrysolmelid beetle tribe Doryphorini (located in subfamily Chrysomelinae), which it shares with four other genera: Calligrapha, Labidomera, Proseicela, and Zygogramma.|$|E
50|$|In the mine, Miles is {{chased by}} a beetle, but is saved by John, Sophia and Hanz, while Marcel sneaks away {{to get the}} emeralds. The others catch up with Marcel as he {{collects}} the emeralds, {{and find a way}} to an exit, but Marcel believes they will send him to prison so shoots Hanz, before being torn in half by a beetle. John, Sophie and Miles continue their escape, while a barely alive Hanz is eventually killed by <b>the</b> <b>beetles.</b> John, Sophia and Miles reach an exit, but a queen beetle blocks their path. John shoots the queen, injuring it. On the surface, Samantha and Emily are attacked by a group of <b>the</b> <b>beetles.</b> Emily contacts John on the walkie talkie, allowing <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> on <b>the</b> surface to hear <b>the</b> queen <b>beetle</b> in pain, resulting in <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> going down into the mine. John and Miles set down explosives in the mine, before escaping with Sophia as <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> are killed in the explosions and collapse of the mine. Reaching the surface, Sophia gives John a bag of the emeralds, while taking some for herself, before leaving the re-united family.|$|R
5|$|Other {{cultural}} controls {{may be used}} {{in combination}} with crop rotation: Mulching the potato crop with straw early in the growing season may reduce <b>the</b> <b>beetle’s</b> ability to locate potato fields, and the mulch creates an environment that favours beetle's predators; Plastic-lined trenches have been used as pitfall traps to catch <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> as they move toward a field of potatoes in the spring, exploiting their inability to fly immediately after emergence; Flamethrowers may also be used to kill <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> when they are visible {{at the top of the}} plant's foliage.|$|R
50|$|This {{lily beetle}} may be {{confused}} with <b>the</b> cardinal <b>beetle</b> (Pyrochroa serraticornis), which also has red elytra and a black underside. The wing cases of <b>the</b> lily leaf <b>beetle</b> are dimpled and are shinier and more rounded than those of <b>the</b> cardinal <b>beetle,</b> which are relatively dull, and narrower, flatter, and more elongated. <b>The</b> cardinal <b>beetle</b> also has comb-like antennae. <b>The</b> lily leaf <b>beetle</b> is herbivorous, while <b>the</b> cardinal <b>beetle</b> preys on insects. <b>The</b> lily leaf <b>beetle</b> is also confused with unspotted ladybirds, but it is narrower in shape.|$|R
5|$|The fogstand beetle of the Namib Desert, Stenocara gracilipes, is able {{to collect}} water from fog, as its elytra have a {{textured}} surface combining hydrophilic (water-loving) bumps and waxy, hydrophobic troughs. <b>The</b> <b>beetle</b> faces the early morning breeze, holding up its abdomen; droplets condense on the elytra and run along ridges towards their mouthparts. Similar adaptations are found in several other Namib desert beetles such as Onymacris unguicularis.|$|E
5|$|The geranium, for example, {{produces}} a unique chemical compound in its petals {{to defend itself}} from Japanese beetles. Within 30 minutes of ingestion the chemical paralyzes the herbivore. While the chemical usually wears off within a few hours, during this time <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> is often consumed by its own predators.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountain}} pine beetle {{is a native}} insect species that is known to experience large outbreaks that infest forest groves, and is particularly common in areas with numerous lodgepole pines and fir trees. A large infestation occurred from 1995 through 2003, and <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> wiped out areas of lodgepole pine in the SNRA, an area historically too cold for outbreaks to occur.|$|E
50|$|In the mine, {{the group}} {{searches}} for the emeralds, but is attacked by <b>the</b> <b>beetles,</b> which kill Carlo. The {{rest of the group}} fends <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> off with their guns. However, a cave-in occurs, causing a crack to appear in the ground in the forest near Samantha and Emily. A number of beetles escape and begin to chase them back to the cabin. Inside, Samantha attempts to get into contact with John on the walkie talkie; however, when this fails Samantha and Emily decide to leave the cabin armed with a gun, only to both be knocked unconscious by Stephan. Meanwhile, Marcel forces the group to continue to the emeralds, causing tensions to run high. Marcel and Vincent get into an argument, leading Marcel to shoot Vincent dead before the survivours are once again attacked by <b>the</b> <b>beetles,</b> but manage to escape. When Samantha and Emily wake up, Stephan does not believe their warnings of <b>the</b> <b>beetles,</b> but he is decapitated when <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> attack <b>the</b> cabin, while Samantha and Emily escape.|$|R

5|$|A 2009 {{study of}} tansy beetle {{occupancy}} amongst 1305 patches (stems separated by {{no more than}} 50cm) of the tansy plant {{on the banks of the}} River Ouse (York, UK) intended to establish data on the distribution of tansy plants and relate this to existing tansy beetle populations in order to contribute to the conservation effort of the species. The results were analysed using generalised additive models to conclude that the tansy patches should be managed towards volumes of 3m and that these patches should be targeted within 200m of existing beetle subpopulations on the same river bank in order to help <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> population disperse and survive.|$|E
5|$|A few insects, such {{as members}} of the {{families}} Poduridae and Onychiuridae (Collembola), Mycetophilidae (Diptera) and <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> families Lampyridae, Phengodidae, Elateridae and Staphylinidae are bioluminescent. The most familiar group are the fireflies, beetles of the family Lampyridae. Some species are able to control this light generation to produce flashes. The function varies with some species using them to attract mates, while others use them to lure prey. Cave dwelling larvae of Arachnocampa (Mycetophilidae, fungus gnats) glow to lure small flying insects into sticky strands of silk.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} Lundy cabbage, Psylliodes luridipennis has been {{listed in the}} United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan, and an action plan for its {{conservation}}, along with the conservation of other endemic species, has been prepared. This plan revolves mostly around the control of Rhododendron ponticum, an alien species which threatens the Lundy cabbage. <b>The</b> <b>beetle</b> is threatened by fluctuating numbers of Lundy cabbages. Though it is quicker than P. napi to recolonise new growth after bad years for the cabbage, it is slower to recover than the cabbage itself.|$|E
50|$|It is {{believed}} that the Hungerford's crawling water beetle requires cool (15 - 25 C), swift flowing alkaline streams with sand and gravel bottoms. While in their larval stage, <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> gather in concentrations of microalgae and in slower moving waters. <b>The</b> <b>beetles</b> {{are thought to have}} historically favored beaver dams.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> grapevine <b>beetle,</b> Pelidnota punctata, {{also known}} as <b>the</b> spotted June <b>beetle</b> or <b>the</b> spotted pelidnota, is a species of beetle, {{a member of the}} {{subfamily}} Rutelinae of <b>the</b> Scarab <b>beetle</b> family. Grapevine beetles are common in the north and central United States and Eastern Canada, but do relatively little damage to their host plants. <b>The</b> <b>beetles</b> fly at a fast speed, usually in a curving flight.|$|R
50|$|Loss of {{reproductive}} capabilities through Metaparasitylenchus hypothenemi parasitization {{is tied to}} the lifecycle of the nematode. Mature parasitic females are carried through <b>the</b> <b>beetle’s</b> lifecycle. During this time, eggs hatch within the female and proceed through to stage J3 (see Lifecycle) and at this point are ready to exit <b>the</b> host <b>beetle.</b> Exit occurs through the GI tract or the reproductive tract and expulsion involves arrest of <b>the</b> <b>beetle’s</b> own reproductive capabilities.|$|R
