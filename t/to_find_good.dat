5|$|From 1961 to 1967, he was {{a leading}} member of a strong Scottish {{international}} team that lost only once to England, in 1965, shortly after he recovered from the leg fracture. He thought his best international performance was a 2–1 win against England in 1963, when he scored both goals after Scotland were reduced to 10 players. In the 1967 match against England, who had won the 1966 World Cup, he taunted the opposition by ball juggling while waiting for his teammates <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>good</b> positions. Although he was given most {{of the credit for}} the 3–2 win, some commentators wished he had made an effort to run up a bigger score.|$|E

25|$|After {{graduating from}} Dublin in 1920, Quinlan {{returned}} to Western Australia, where he {{entered into a}} partnership with J. R. Maxwell in the legal firm of J. and R. Maxwell. He played WACA District cricket for the East Perth Cricket Club, and represented Western Australia on tours to the Eastern states in three seasons. He captained the side in one match against South Australia in March 1927. He carried his bat in the first innings, scoring 40 {{runs out of the}} side's innings of 131, to become the first Western Australian cricketer to do so. In addition to his cricketing activities, Quinlan {{was a member of the}} Western Australian Turf Club, and owned several racehorses. In 1925, he married Ella Byrne, the daughter of Louis Byrne, who had previously served as the Dublin coroner, with whom he had one daughter. Quinlan died at his home on Mounts Bay Road in Perth on 15 August 1935, after a long illness which had prevented him from working for four years. He had spent time in several European countries before his death in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>good</b> health. He was buried at Karrakatta Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|Since 1998, the {{insurance}} company Western QBE had been Glory's title (front-of-shirt) sponsor. However, when ownership of the Glory was handed to FFA, Western QBE decided not to sponsor the club for the 2006–07 season. This left the Glory in a tough position—a lack of sponsorship and owners meant a lack of money, a lack of quality players, poor results and poor football, poor crowd attendances and low ticket sales. This is the model that had affected so many NSL clubs and led to their demise, and had led {{to the demise of}} the New Zealand Knights. Therefore, the Glory knew they needed to find a sponsor quickly, and transitional owners FFA knew they needed <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>good</b> owners in a timely fashion as well. 18 rounds into the 2006–07 season, Western QBE returned as title sponsor, signing for the remaining three rounds and {{until the end of the}} 2007–08 A-League season. This brought much-needed stability to the club; the funds helped to secure the supporters' faith, which set off another chain-reaction: fans meant more money, which meant more advertisement, which meant survival, which meant potential owners felt more secure about bidding for the club's licence. This all led to a much larger and more highly respected squad for the 2007–08 season.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some that {{this is perhaps the}} most interesting of all the series events, including the race itself. In this event there are heats of 5–8 riders, depending on the number of riders signed up for the day. These heats are seeded according to the results of each rider's ITT. Riders are placed along the starting line in order from fastest (on the inside) to slowest (on the outside) and are then given one lap to get the position they want in the pack and to gain some speed. Once they cross the start/finish line again, the race begins. The riders race around the track and every time the pack crosses the start/finish line, the last one to cross is out and must leave the track. Riders keep racing until there are only three riders left. These three riders {{move on to the next}} round. This process continues until the final heat of 8. In this heat, riders continue to race and get out until you have the last three and then they commence a one lap full out sprint and the first, second, and third-place winners are determined by the order in which the riders cross the start/finish line. This is a great event because it really measures the skill of a rider, because in order to win, a rider must be more than just fast. If a rider hopes to win, she must also have good drafting skills, the ability <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>good</b> positioning, the intuition to know when to get out of the pack and sprint around the outside, and the endurance to be able to do this all day.|$|E

[...] His budget for fiction was low, but he was occasionally able <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>good</b> stories from well-known writers which had been rejected by the other markets. [...] Circulation continued to decline and in 1978 Cohen sold out his half of the business to his partner, Arthur Bernhard. [...] White resigned shortly afterwards, and was replaced by Elinor Mavor, but within two years Bernhard decided to close down Fantastic, merging it with Amazing, which had always had slightly higher circulation.|$|E

He points out that she increasingly starred in adventure pictures, which allowed her to develop her acting and keep her profile high in Hollywood. O'Hara had next intended appearing opposite Tyrone Power in , but was hospitalized in early 1942, during which she had her appendix and two ovarian cysts removed at Reno Hospital. Producer Zanuck scoffed at the operation, thinking it was an excuse for a break. He passed it off as [...] "probably a fragment left over from an abortion", which deeply offended her, being a devout Catholic.|$|E
500|$|Wrzos persuaded Cohen {{that both}} Amazing and Fantastic should carry {{a new story}} in every issue, rather than running nothing but reprints; Goldsmith had left a backlog of {{unpublished}} stories, and Wrzos was able to stretch these out for some time. [...] One such story was Fritz Leiber's [...] "Stardock", another Fafhrd and Gray Mouser story, {{which appeared in the}} September 1965 issue; it was subsequently nominated for a Hugo Award. [...] The reprints were well received by the fans, because Wrzos was able <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>good</b> quality stories that were unavailable except in the original magazines, meaning that to many of Fantastic's readers they were fresh material. [...] Wrzos also reprinted [...] "The People of the Black Circle", a Robert E. Howard story from Weird Tales, in 1967, when Howard's Conan stories were becoming popular.|$|E

On 19 March 1549, Lu Tang and Ke Qiao ambushed two junks in Zoumaxi while they were trading with the Portuguese aboard resulting in 33 deaths and 206 smugglers captured. Among the captured were Li Guangtou and a number of Portuguese men, and Lu Tang had four of the more good-looking Portuguese pretend to be kings of Malacca {{in order to make the}} victory seem more complete.

Two days later the submarine encountered a convoy. After running ahead to improve her firing position, she sank cargo ship Yoko Maru with a spread of three torpedoes. Continuing her patrol, Harder sighted two more ships 13 September, but she was forced down by enemy planes while firing torpedoes. Escorts kept the submarine down with a severe depth charge attack which lasted for over two days and almost exhausted her batteries. After evading the Japanese ships, Harder detected her next target 19 September; a torpedo sent Kachisan Maru to the bottom almost immediately. Though running in bad weather, Harder continued <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>good</b> targets.
