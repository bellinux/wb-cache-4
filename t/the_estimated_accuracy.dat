40|$|A {{methodology}} {{to estimate}} in-bank river discharge exclusively from remotely sensed hydraulic data is developed. Water-surface width and maximum channel width measured from 26 aerial and digital orthophotos of 17 single channel rivers and 41 SAR images of three braided rivers were coupled with channel slope {{data obtained from}} topographic maps to <b>estimate</b> <b>the</b> discharge. The standard error of <b>the</b> discharge <b>estimates</b> were within a factor of 1. 5 – 2 (50 – 100 %) of the observed, with <b>the</b> mean <b>estimate</b> <b>accuracy</b> within 10 %. This level of accuracy was achieved using calibration functions developed from observed discharge. The calibration functions use reach specific geomorphic variables, the maximum channel width and the channel slope, to predict a correction factor. The calibration functions are related to channel type. Surface velocity and width information, obtained from a single C-band image obtained by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s (JPL’s) AirSAR was also used to estimate discharge for a reach of the Missouri River.

This can only be known after the project is completed. If, for example, a project estimate was $1,252,000 for a specific scope and conditions, and at completion the records showed that $1,172,451.26 was expended, <b>the</b> <b>estimate</b> was 6.8% too high.

A {{common practice in}} supervised machine learning, is thus to test if <b>the</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>accuracy</b> is significantly better than chance level. This method of signal detection is particularly popular in neuroimaging and genetics. We provide evidence that using a classifier's accuracy as a test statistic can be an underpowered strategy for finding differences between populations, compared to a bona-fide statistical test. It is also computationally more demanding than a statistical test. Via simulation, we compare test statistics {{that are based on}} classification accuracy, to others based on multivariate test statistics. We find that probability of detecting differences between two distributions is lower for accuracy based statistics. We examine several candidate causes for the low power of accuracy tests. These causes include: the discrete nature of the accuracy test statistic, the type of signal accuracy tests are designed to detect, their inefficient use of the data, and their regularization. When the purposes of the analysis is not signal detection, but rather, the evaluation of a particular classifier, we suggest several improvements to increase power.

30|$|In this article, {{we propose}} a new hybrid {{algorithm}} for 2 D DOA estimation {{in the presence}} of mutual coupling for sparse UCAs. Based on the manifold decomposition technique, we will present two new formulations of the steering vector {{in the presence of}} mutual coupling for sparse UCAs. One formulation, corresponding to Jacobi-Anger expansion [12], allows applying a modified UCA-RARE algorithm to <b>estimate</b> <b>the</b> azimuth angle without the exact knowledge of mutual coupling and elevation angle. The other formulation, corresponding to Bauer's formula [13], allows executing a Root-MUSIC algorithm in the elevation direction to <b>estimate</b> <b>the</b> elevation angle for each estimated azimuth angle. For sparse UCAs, compared with the original UCA-RARE, the modified UCA-RARE is able to avoid obtaining spurious estimates which only arise from the sparseness of the array elements. Note that the steering vector expansion for <b>estimating</b> <b>the</b> elevation angle in this article differs from that in [5] and has a more universal application [10, 14, 15]. In fact, these two kinds of decomposition techniques applied in this article can be considered as manifold decomposition transformations [11, 16 – 18]. It is shown that <b>the</b> DOA <b>estimate</b> <b>accuracy</b> usually depends on the truncation error introduced by the transformation [16 – 19]. Hence, we analyze the truncation errors for sparse UCAs and derive expressions describing the truncation errors in <b>the</b> DOA <b>estimates.</b> We find that the impact of the truncation error on <b>the</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>accuracy</b> of azimuth angle is weaker than it for <b>the</b> elevation angle <b>estimate.</b> Therefore, a method to choose an appropriate truncated degree for <b>the</b> elevation <b>estimates</b> is presented to enhance <b>the</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>accuracy.</b>|$|R

One noticeable problem is that <b>the</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>accuracy</b> for crops acreage in a certain year is not high, so that Remote Sensing Applications Centre (RSAC) has to use investigated data of crops acreage of two consecutive years to estimate the change rate of crops acreage. Aiming at the issue, the theory of double sampling based on operational crops acreage investigation was brought forward by RSAC. The paper has given detailed account of the theory and a typical case. In the double sampling method, the first sampling is to estimate the proportion of small features spatially distributing in crops fields in order to purify the samples acting as basis units for calculation in the second sampling. The second sampling is called a kind of stratified sampling which is used to estimate the crops acreage.
