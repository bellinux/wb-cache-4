5|$|For the {{confrontation}} between Bond and Trevelyan inside the antenna cradle, director Campbell decided to <b>take</b> <b>inspiration</b> from Bond's fight with Red Grant in From Russia with Love. Pierce Brosnan and Sean Bean {{did all the}} stunts themselves, except for one take where one is thrown against the wall. Brosnan injured his hand while filming the extending ladder sequence, making producers delay his scenes and film the ones in Severnaya earlier.|$|E
5|$|The {{studio is}} praised {{primarily}} for its original and innovative productions, {{and it has}} gretely affected the animated film history over the last decades. Disney studios <b>take</b> <b>inspiration</b> {{from some of the}} other studios such as Studio Ghibli and Madhouse because the production team feels that many of the Japan's studios are ahead of them and capable of making better animation, which is the reason why they get inspiration from what those studios produce.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{fighting}} demons, {{the protagonist}} can negotiate {{with them in}} a variety of ways: demons can be bribed, scared away, or recruited depending on responses given during conversation. After they are recruited, different demons can be fused together to create new demons. The new demon inherits skills from its parents, and some demons can only be obtained through fusion. The game includes 300 recruitable demons, all of which <b>take</b> <b>inspiration</b> from various world mythologies including Welsh, Egyptian, Norse, and Christian. Two main alignments govern the way demons must be approached: one that represents light, neutral and dark alignments; and one representing law, neutral and chaos alignments. The choices made in the story also effect how demons respond to player commands, and whether they will remain loyal. As with earlier titles, a Moon Phase divided into eight segments dictates how demons will behave. When the Moon is full, demons will refuse to talk. Fused demons can be shared between players using thirty-two character passwords generated when a new demon is fused. These passwords can be traded between different players.|$|E

5|$|Similar to the Moor-Christian {{confrontation}} of the morisca—whether in Spain or in transplanted versions in Central America—there are also elaborate ritual dances in Mexico {{such as the}} Danza de la Pluma that exploit {{the trauma of the}} Spanish conquest of indigenous America. Weapons employed may be swords (and shields) whips, even firearms. These representations take place over a large area of Mesoamerica and, in part, are an obvious adaptation of Spanish tradition, but in Mexico will pit the native Aztec against the Spanish invader. The most interesting aspect of these dances is that—depending on where one sees them and under what conditions—it is plausible to read into the dances an outcome other than the historical Spanish victory. That is, indigenous performers may <b>take</b> <b>inspiration</b> {{from the fact that the}} natives of Spain drove out the Moorish invaders; thus, the natives of Mesoamerica, too, shall one day drive out the invaders.|$|E
5|$|The Second Test {{match was}} held at Lord's, but Miller was still unable to bowl when it began. He came in to bat in the first innings with Australia at 3/166 on the first {{afternoon}} after electing to bat. Bedser bowled three consecutive outswingers; the fourth ball swung the other way, and Miller was hit on the pads not offering a shot, believing that the ball would have curved away past the stumps. The umpire upheld England's appeal for leg before wicket (lbw) and Miller was out for four. O'Reilly blamed Miller's poor form with the bat on an excessive bowling workload imposed on him by Bradman. Australia made 350, but suffered a blow when Lindwall's injury flared {{up in the first}} over; Lindwall played on through the pain. Bradman threw Miller the ball, hoping that the all rounder would reverse his decision not to bowl and <b>take</b> <b>inspiration</b> from Lindwall. The injured bowler returned the ball, citing his back. His gesture generated news headlines among journalists who believed that he had disobeyed Bradman.|$|E

It also <b>took</b> <b>inspiration</b> from the East German series Polizeiruf 110 and the American film Lethal Weapon. By making the propaganda and inaccuracies obvious to a western audience, they hoped to make the subtle nature of modern propaganda more clear.

25|$|Several {{other type}} {{designers}} modelled typefaces from this popular typeface. Max Miedinger at the Haas Foundry {{used it as}} a model for the typeface Neue Haas-Grotesk, released in 1957 and renamed Helvetica in 1961. Miedinger sought to refine the typeface making it more even and unified, with a higher x-height and tighter spacing. Two other releases from 1957, Adrian Frutiger's Univers and Bauer and Baum's Folio, <b>take</b> <b>inspiration</b> from Akzidenz-Grotesk.|$|E
25|$|On 29 January, {{riot police}} in Gabon fired tear gas {{to break up}} a protest by around 5,000 {{opposition}} supporters, where according to witnesses, up to 20 people were wounded. It was the second such protest since opposition leader Andre Mba Obame declared himself president on January 25 and urged people to <b>take</b> <b>inspiration</b> from Tunisia's uprising. Obame subsequently hid out in the local United Nations Development Programme office, while President Bongo shut down TV stations and allegedly kidnapped members of the opposition. The UN is accusing Gabon's police of invading and beating students within the university. Although initial protests overwhelmingly consisted of opposition loyalists, the unrest appears to be developing into a wider social conflict, with students leading the protests.|$|E
25|$|The final Sunday, {{featuring}} the men's singles final, saw Rafael Nadal win the first Wimbledon {{title of his}} career and fifth Grand Slam tournament. No. 1 seed and five-time champion Roger Federer was aiming to equal William Renshaw's record of six consecutive Wimbledon titles (1881–1886), and edge ever closer to Pete Sampras's record of 14 Grand Slam titles, of which Federer had 12. Nadal, the No. 2 seed and four-time French Open champion was Federer's challenger {{for the third consecutive}} year, and was aiming to become the first man since Björn Borg to win the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year. Nadal's countryman, Manuel Santana, the last Spaniard to have won the Wimbledon title (in 1966), said Nadal could <b>take</b> <b>inspiration</b> from Spain's victory in the recent European Championships, which Spain had last won in 1964.|$|E

25|$|Ottawa {{has several}} older neighbourhoods {{clustered}} around the downtown core, including the Glebe, Sandy Hill, New Edinburgh, Centretown, Lower Town and Old Ottawa South. These areas were mainly built up {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries. The houses in these areas tend to be in Victorian or Queen Anne style, but rarely have any conspicuous ornamentation. These are usually two or three storey single homes. Recent infills in these neighbourhoods have often taken the form of townhouses. Red brick, sometimes painted other colours, is the dominant surface material. Most houses have sizable lots, with a driveway running to a shed, or a small lane way running behind the buildings. In the 1920s and 1930s new styles were imported, and many houses from this era <b>take</b> <b>inspiration</b> from the Arts and crafts and Prairie styles.|$|E
25|$|His {{interest}} in first-hand {{investigation of the}} human nature was accompanied, at least after he reached maturity, by a distaste for generous and universalist theories. Caragiale viewed their impact on Romanian society with a critical eye. Like Junimea, he was amused by the cultural legacy of 1848 Wallachian revolutionaries, and by its image in National Liberal discourse. Nevertheless, he claimed {{that there was a}} clear difference between the first generation of liberal activists—Ion Câmpineanu, Ion Heliade Rădulescu, and Nicolae Bălcescu—and the new liberal establishment, which, as he believed, had come to cultivate hypocrisy, demagogy, and political corruption. He exemplified the latter group by citing some of its prominent members: Pantazi Ghica, Nicolae Misail and Mihail Pătârlăgeanu. At one point, he argued that, had they not died young, the leaders of 1848 could have found themselves best represented by the Conservatives. He recorded the way in which National Liberal politicians claimed to <b>take</b> <b>inspiration</b> from the revolt, and pointed out that the 1848 slogans had become rallying calls for the most banal causes.|$|E

500|$|... is a romantic, slice-of-life shōjo (targeted towards girls) manga by Clamp, an all-female, manga artist team {{consisting}} of Satsuki Igarashi, Mokona, Tsubaki Nekoi, and Nanase Ohkawa. Appearing as a monthly serial in the Japanese manga magazine Monthly Young Rose from December 1993 to June 1995, the twelve stories were collected into a bound volume by Kadokawa Shoten {{and published in}} July 1995. The One I Love contains twelve independent manga stories, each focusing on an aspect of love and accompanied by an essay.

500|$|Journalist Kevin Stewart-Panko {{argues that}} the American grindcore of the 1990s {{borrowed}} from three sources: British grindcore, the American precursors, and death metal. As early Napalm Death albums were not widely distributed in the United States, American groups tended to <b>take</b> <b>inspiration</b> from later works, such as Harmony Corruption. American groups also often employ riffs taken from crossover thrash or thrash metal. Early American grind practitioners included Terrorizer and Assück. Anal Cunt, a particularly dissonant group who lacked a bass player, were also particularly influential. Their style was {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "noisecore" [...] or [...] "noisegrind", described by Giulio of Cripple Bastards as [...] "the most anti-musical and nihilistic face of extreme music at that time." [...] Brutal Truth was a groundbreaking group in the American scene {{at the beginning of the}} 1990s.|$|E

After believing he has killed Mayor Quimby, Homer decides to <b>take</b> <b>inspiration</b> from the film Weekend at Bernie's (1989) and [...] "use the body to stage an elaborate farce." [...] The title of the episode is a reference to the film Married to the Mob (1988). During the Guys and Dolls scene the cast members sing a song with the musical's title to the tune of [...] "Hooray for Hollywood", which as Mark Hamill points out isn't one of the show's musical numbers.|$|E

Madonna's face was mainly shot above her head, with her face looking up {{just ahead of the}} camera focus. Sometimes she looks to a video screen behind her which plays the scenes from the film, as if to <b>take</b> <b>inspiration</b> for her singing. Other times she is accompanied by her back-up singers, mainly during the chorus, and sometimes she sings alone.
