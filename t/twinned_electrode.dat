An investigation is presented in which real defects are imitated by two disk electrodes of the same metal, embedded in insulating matrix and electrically connected. A variety of measurements was performed to characterise the corrosion of this <b>twin</b> <b>electrodes</b> set-up: SVET, micro-distributions of pH and dissolved O- 2, polarisation curves, galvanic current and video monitoring. The tendency for anodic and cathodic processes to proceed in separated electrodes was observed.

40|$|Abstract — A new {{development}} of hybrid in-process electrical dressing of metal-bonded diamond grinding wheels is proposed in this paper. The electrical dressing method {{is used for}} overcoming {{the limitations of the}} conventional dressing methods available in relation to a super-abrasive wheel because of the hardness of its abrasive grains and the durability of its bonding material. The proposed hybrid in-process electrical dressing method consists of electro-discharge and electro-chemical processes and is implemented with <b>twin</b> copper <b>electrodes</b> and alternating power supplies. The results show that with properly maintained process conditions, a better surface finish is produced by the proposed method compared with traditional rotating SiC wheel dressing. Index Terms — Electro-chemical, electro-discharge, inprocess dressing, metal-bonded diamond grinding wheel. eliminates the need for a carbon brush as a means to deliver the current to the wheel during a dressing process. A combination of electro-chemical and electro-discharge dressing has been developed by Schopf et al. [2] and Ohmori et al. [3]. It suggested that the electro-chemical dressing is assisted by the thermal erosive effect of electrical discharge. The application is implemented for centreless grinding with single electrode supplied with a DC power supply via a pair of brushes. A further improvement is proposed here. The use of <b>twin</b> <b>electrodes</b> [4] and in-process dressing using AC power supplies are implemented. This approach allows electro-chemical and electro-discharge dressings to be performed individually as required, rather than conducted alternating on single electrode.

However, today no extant buildings or features associated with the monastery are known.

A significant number of linear anomalies have been detected east of St Finian’s church using magnetic gradiometry and <b>twin</b> <b>electrode</b> resistance surveying. Many of these anomalies are probably field boundaries; however, a much greater diversity of geophysical responses is located south and west of St Finian’s church.

40|$|We have {{explored}} the un-enhanced Raman spectra of both single and <b>twin</b> <b>electrodes</b> in 3. 5 % NaCl solution (at ambient temperatures) over {{a range of}} applied potentials (between 20 and 200 mV) and times (between 0 and 5 h). Under these conditions, we observed the initial formation of 'green rust' (hydroxychlorides and/or hydroxycarbonates), followed by the formation of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and then a mixture of the alpha- and gamma-FeOOH (goethite and lepidocrocite, respectively). These data are consistent with a model for corrosion during which the initially formed magnetite is either covered, or replaced, by layers of the FeOOH oxidation products. Fitting of the data {{as a function of}} time and potential shows that, although the product range is independent of potential, the relative kinetics of formation of magnetite and its subsequent conversion to the gamma-FeOOH were potential and time dependent. Analysis by mapping of the dry corroded surface showed a variety of species, including green rust, some Fe(OH) (3), as well as the gamma-FeOOH, and possibly some beta-FeOOH. But no surface magnetite was found, indicating that this material had been either covered up or converted to FeOOH. We noted several complications during this work, including the interference of resonance effects (on the Raman intensities) and the heterogeneity of the corrosion process (and hence distribution of species on the corroded surface). However, we believe that the use of un-enhanced Raman methods has led to conclusions more likely to be relevant to 'real' corrosion processes. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

The changes of arc pressure distribution along anode surface and the weld appearance were evaluated. On this basis, the dependences of weld shape characterized with weld depth, width and undercut on the main welding parameters were discussed. The results indicate, the substitution of coupling arc electrode can lead to an obvious decrease of arc pressure. Compared to hollow tungsten <b>electrode</b> and <b>twin</b> tungsten <b>electrodes,</b> the coupling arc electrode is much easier to manufacture and has more compacter structure. Combined with the symmetric distribution of arc pressure in different directions, this electrode has extensive adaptability.

Their joint action makes this welding method have the capability of realizing high travel speed and deep penetration welding.|$|R
40|$|Microbial biofilms are {{significant}} ecosystems where {{the existence of}} redox gradients drive electron transfer often via soluble electron mediators. This study describes the use of two interfacing working electrodes (WEs) to simulate redox gradients within close proximity (250 µm) for the detection and quantification of electron mediators. By using a common counter and reference electrode, the potentials of the two WEs were independently controlled to maintain a suitable “voltage window”, which enabled simultaneous oxidation and reduction of electron mediators {{as evidenced by the}} concurrent anodic and cathodic currents, respectively. To validate the method, the electrochemical properties of different mediators (hexacyanoferrate, HCF, riboflavin, RF) were characterized by stepwise shifting the “voltage window” (ranging between 25 and 200 mV) within a range of potentials after steady equilibrium current of both WEs was established. The resulting differences in electrical currents between the two WEs were recorded across a defined potential spectrum (between − 1 V and + 0. 5 V vs. Ag/AgCl). Results indicated that the technique enabled identification (by the distinct peak locations at the potential scale) and quantification (by the peak of current) of the mediators for individual species as well as in an aqueous mixture. It enabled a precise determination of mid-potentials of the externally added mediators (HCF, RF) and mediators produced by pyocyanin-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (WACC 91) culture.

40|$|The {{radiofrequency}} field used in Magnetic Resonance Imaging is scattered by implanted medical devices. The scattered {{field is}} concentrated in the tissue surrounding the implant and conduction currents will flow in the tissue resulting in potentially hazardous heating. Patients with medical implants can undergo diagnostic or interventional MRI procedures and thus the scattering of the MRI RF field by medical implants merits a detailed investigation. In this thesis, scattering by various types of implants has been investigated. The scattered field of a deep brain stimulation lead can be very intense near the electrodes stimulating the brain. The lead is just like an antenna excited by an incident electromagnetic field in a dissipative medium. The greatest concern regarding MRI induced heating is when the lead length approaches the resonant length. The factors that determine the resonant length of a lead are examined. The finite element method is used to find the near field for the lead immersed in nonhomogeneous tissue and connected to an implantable pulse generator {{as well as for}} varying distances of the connecting portion of the lead from the air-tissue interface. Electric field, SAR, dissipated powers and induced temperature rise distributions have been obtained in the brain tissue surrounding the electrodes. It is shown that the presence of the IPG can significantly change the induced temperature rise and that the near proximity of the air-tissue interface results in a reduction in the induced temperature rise. The computed values are in good agreement with in-vitro measurements made in the laboratory. Similar analyses and computations have been carried out for an implanted vagus nerve stimulation lead device. Current distributions in the twin-strand lead have been computed. SAR and temperature rise distributions have been obtained around the <b>twin</b> <b>electrodes</b> which are placed on the left vagus nerve. A model implant embedded in nonhomogeneous tissue has been investigated. The nature of the embedding tissue is varied and the current distribution in the implant, the scattered field, and the temperature rise distributions in the tissue surrounding the electrodes has been computed. It has been found that the induced temperature rise is significantly lower for tissue with a lower conductivity and permittivity such as fat than for tissue with a higher conductivity and permittivity such as muscle. The interaction of the MRI RF field with orthopedic implants is investigated. As specific case studies, the scattered fields due to a bone support frame implant and a hip joint implant are computed. It is found that the greatest MRI- induced heating occurs at the tips of long metal parts where the length and thickness of a metal part and its tips determine the amount of induced heating. For the bone support frame, the induced surface current density distributions on the steel pins and the spatial electric field distributions in the surrounding tissue have been obtained. For the hip joint, the maximum temperature rise is at the elliptical tip of the long cylindrical limb of the joint where it joins the femur. The spatial electric field and temperature rise distributions around intravascular stents of various lengths have also been obtained. The maximum temperature rise occurs in the tissue surrounding the tips of a stent. The induced heating effect increases with increasing lengt...|$|R

The performances of the sensor in terms of linearity, low anodic saturation and high stability show its potential application for direct methanol fuel cells. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

The potential range of coalescence b came large with the decrease in the dielectric onstant, i. e. with the increase in methanol content. This behavior was ascribed to the compression f the diffuse double layer. It was supposed from measurements of dif-ferential double layer capacities that the dielectric onstant in the diffuse double layer was small in comparison with the bulk value, being proportional tothe third power of the dielectric onstant in the Stern layer. It was found, moreover, that the free energy of adsorption of methanol molecules at the mercury-solution nterface was ca. — 1 Kcal/mole, and hence the coalescence of mercury droplets was little affected by the formation of the adsorbed film of methanol molecules...|$|R
40|$|A {{methanol}} concentration sensor {{based on}} <b>twin</b> Nafion membrane <b>electrode</b> assemblies (MEAs) was constructed with anodes {{face to face}} eliminating the interference of oxygen in environment.

Electrochemical characterization shows that the sensor has good response performance with a concentration range up to 5 M and the signal increases with temperature elevating. The slightly nonlinearity of the working curves was mainly caused by electro-osmotic effect confirmed by electro-osmotic drag coefficient.

We developed an intraluminal catheter with a pressure transducer {{on it to}} study intraluminal pressure changes and a <b>twin</b> bipolar <b>electrode</b> to record the ureteric EMG and impedance (Z) changes during a peristaltic wave. Five female New Yorkshire pigs (50 - 60 kg) were studied under light halothane anesthesia (5 % at induction/ 1 % for maintenance). A steady state of hydration was maintained using intravenous saline infusion. EMG spike burst activity was studied at a 10 -cm interval using low (0 - 30) Hz filters. Impedance between the same electrodes is measured simultaneously in higher frequencies (1 - 5 KHz) {{as a function of}} ureteric motor activity. Pressure generation in the ureteric lumen was also measured simultaneously by a transducer on the same catheter. A digital signal processing program (Poly 4. 9) was used for analysis. Parenteral furosemide was used to induce diuresis. Resting ureteric impedance (Z(R)) decreases to Z(B) (Z bolus) during the passage of the urinary bolus. Passage of a contractile zone during a peristaltic wave increases impedance from Z(B) to its Z(R) level and initiates a pressure rise. Bolus length (the length Z(B)) is not constant and decreases distally. EMG corresponds well in time to impedance. Z(R) disappears after infusion of furosemide because of increased urine load and changes of intraluminal ionic environment. The contractile segment of a ureteric peristaltic wave appears to be represented by an elevated Z segment (Z(C)). Pressure rise is recorded only {{at the beginning of a}} contractile zone.

Thus, the interaction between macroscopic mercury droplets was proved to be essentially the same as that between submicroscopic hydrophobic particles in these cases, providing at the same time the most direct proof of the theory. For solutions, however, in which ionic or nonionic surface active materials were added in addition to the supporting inorganic electrolyte, no coalescence occurred even at the zero polarization for surface active material concentrations higher than certain values, i. e. a perfect stabilization took place. These critical concentrations were found to depend on the HLB values of the surface active materials added; the stabilizing power increased with increasing hydrophilic property of the molecule.

30|$|Increasing {{welding speed}} must {{eliminate}} several weld forming defects, such as undercut and humping bead. It is generally accepted that the occurrences of undercut and humping bead have similar mechanism. Some theories had been proposed to reveal this reason. Mills and Keene [1] {{suggested that the}} presences of humping bead and undercut attribute to the Marangoni force created in molten pool, {{which is based on}} the observation that humping bead is affected by sulfur content in the weld metal. Paton et al. [2] believed that, there exists a pressure balance between the welding arc and the molten metal. Arc pressure increases with the welding current to the point of an imbalance in forces and the defects begin to form. A supercritical flow model was proposed by Yamamoto and Shimada [3]. Under conditions of high current and welding speed, weld depression forms because of the high arc pressure, and the front of molten pool turns into a thin liquid layer called gouging region followed by a trailing region. Humping bead will occur when the velocity of the thin layer is beyond the critical value for a hydraulic jump. Soderstrom and Mendez [4] modified this model. Humping bead produces when the arc pressure extends the gouging region beyond the heat influence of the arc and premature freezing of the thin liquid film occurs. The backfilled trailing region then solidifies. To solve the weld forming problems in high speed TIG welding, depressing the arc pressure is believed a good way. Both hollow tungsten <b>electrode</b> [5] and <b>twin</b> tungsten <b>electrodes</b> [6, 7] had been used in this field. Moreover, some kinds of external magnetic fields were also applied by some researchers [8, 9] to weaken the backward drag of arc and improve the weld formation in high speed TIG welding. Qin et al. [10] employed an assistant TIG arc to prevent the premature solidification of thin liquid layer and the backward molten metal flow.|$|R
