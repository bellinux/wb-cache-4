40|$|Given {{the impact}} of {{computers}} and computing on {{almost every aspect of}} society, the ability to develop, analyze, and implement algorithms is gaining more focus. Algorithms are increasingly important in theoretical mathematics, in applications of mathematics, in computer science, as well as in many areas outside of mathematics. In high school, however, algorithms are usually restricted to computer science courses and as a result, the important relationship between mathematics and computer science is often overlooked (Henderson, 1997). The mathematical ideas behind the design, construction and analysis of algorithms, are important for students' mathematical education. In addition, exploring algorithms can help students see mathematics as a meaningful and creative subject. This study provides a review of the history of algorithms and algorithmic complexity, as well as a <b>technical</b> <b>monograph</b> that illustrates the mathematical aspects of algorithmic complexity in a form that is accessible to mathematics instructors at the high school level. The historical component of this study is broken down into two parts. The first part covers the history of algorithms with an emphasis on how the concept has evolved from 3000 BC through the Middle Ages to the present day. The second part focuses on the history of algorithmic complexity, dating back to the text of Ibn al-majdi, a fourteenth century Egyptian astronomer, through the 20 th century. In particular, it highlights the contributions of a group of mathematicians including Alan Turing, Michael Rabin, Juris Hartmanis, Richard Stearns and Alan Cobham, whose work in computability theory and complexity measures was critical {{to the development of the}} field of algorithmic complexity. The <b>technical</b> <b>monograph</b> which follows describes how the complexity of an algorithm can be measured and analyzes different types of algorithms. It includes divide-and-conquer algorithms, search and sort algorithms, greedy algorithms, algorithms for matching, and geometric algorithms. The methods used to analyze the complexity of these algorithms is done without the use of a programming language in order to focus on the mathematical aspects of the algorithms, and to provide knowledge and skills of value that are independent of specific computers or programming languages. In addition, the study assesses the appropriateness of these topics for use by high school teachers by submitting it for independent review to a panel of experts. The panel, which consists of mathematics and computer science faculty in high school and colleges around the United States, found the material to be interesting and felt that using a pre-programming approach to teaching algorithmic complexity has a great deal of merit. There was some concern, however, that portions of the material may be too advanced for high school mathematics instructors. Additionally, they thought that the material would only appeal to the strongest students. As per the reviewers' suggestions, the monograph was revised to its current form...|$|E

40|$|This {{monograph}} {{presents a}} general mechanical theory for biological growth. It provides both a conceptual and a technical {{foundation for the}} understanding and analysis of problems arising in biology and physiology. The theory and methods is illustrated {{on a wide range}} of examples and applications. A process of extreme complexity, growth plays a fundamental role in many biological processes and is considered to be the hallmark of life itself. Its description has been one of the fundamental problems of life sciences, but until recently, it has not attracted much attention from mathematicians, physicists, and engineers. The author herein presents the first major <b>technical</b> <b>monograph</b> on the problem of growth since D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson’s 1917 book On Growth and Form. The emphasis of the book is on the proper mathematical formulation of growth kinematics and mechanics. Accordingly, the discussion proceeds in order of complexity and the book is divided into five parts. First, a general introduction on the problem of growth from a historical perspective is given. Then, basic concepts are introduced within the context of growth in filamentary structures. These ideas are then generalized to surfaces and membranes and eventually to the general case of volumetric growth. The book concludes with a discussion of open problems and outstanding challenges. Thoughtfully written and richly illustrated to be accessible to readers of varying interests and background, the text will appeal to life scientists, biophysicists, biomedical engineers, and applied mathematicians alike...|$|E
40|$|Sterility {{testing and}} media fills are {{essential}} requirements in the pharmaceutical industry. With {{the results obtained}} the manufacturer must ensure that the aseptic filling process is under control. In an eight year (1988 - 1995) retrospective survey of three major Dutch pharmaceutical companies {{the performance of the}} sterility test, of media fills and their relationship hate been statistically evaluated: The products included human and veterinary pharmaceuticals and biologicals, and were divided into six different groups according to their production process and primary containers. A distinction was made between the results from the period 1985 - 1991 and the period 1992 - 1995, because this made the statistical analyses of a number of types of products possible, and because some significant changes in fire production process were made in 1991 at some of the production sites. The results of the evaluation of the sterility rest show that the frequency of false positives has not changed significantly The overall rate of false positives of 0. 17 % is a factor tell better than considered acceptable by USP XXIII. For all product groups the frequency of positive sterility tests has decreased during the period of investigation. During the period 1992 - 1995 {{there was no significant difference}} between the results of product sterility rests and the negative controls for any of the product groups. This indicates that given the present stare-of-the-art production the sterility test offers little or no additional security. The overall contamination of the media fills done in the more recent period is a factor twenty better than the limit given in the PDA <b>Technical</b> <b>Monograph</b> No. 2. In the more recent period there is a good agreement between the observed positive rate of the sterility tests and the positive rate that had been estimated from the results of the media fills. This indicates that despite some shortcomings, media fills are an adequate simulation of the production process and can be used to give an estimate of the rejection rate for the various product groups. The overall conclusion is that the production conditions of the participating Dutch pharmaceutical companies comply with the current international guidelines for aseptic production and sterility testing...|$|E

We give an elementary proof that the original algorithm is in fact O(N²); and for the special case of three tokens initially we give an exact (quadratic) solution of 4 abc/N, where a,b,c are the tokens' initial separations. Thus the algorithm overall has worst-case expected running time of ⊝(N²). Although we use only simple matrix algebra in the proof, the approach was suggested by the general notions of abstraction, nondeterminism and probabilistic variants [A. McIver, C.

40|$|We {{propose a}} method for {{verification}} of probabilistic distributed systems in which a variation of Kozen’s Kleene Algebra with Tests [Dexter Kozen, Kleene algebra with tests, ACM Trans. Programming Lang. Syst. 19 (3) (1997) 427 – 443] is used {{to take account of}} the well known interaction of probability and “adversarial” scheduling [Annabelle McIver, Carroll Morgan, Abstraction, Refinement and Proof for Probabilistic Systems, <b>Technical</b> <b>Monographs</b> in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag, New York, 2004]. We describe pKA, a probabilistic Kleene-style algebra, based on a widely accepted model of probabilistic/demonic computation [Jifeng He, K. Seidel, A. K. McIver, Probabilistic models for the guarded command language, Sci. Comput. Programming 28 (1997) 171 – 192; Roberto Segala, Modeling and verification of randomized distributed real-time systems, Ph. D. thesis, MIT, 1995; Roberto Segala, Modeling and Verification of Randomized Distributed Real-Time Systems, PhD thesis, MIT, 1995; Annabelle McIver, Carroll Morgan, Abstraction, Refinement and Proof for Probabilistic Systems, <b>Technical</b> <b>Monographs</b> in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag, New York, 2004]. Our technical aim is to express probabilistic versions of Cohen’s separation theorems [E. Cohen, Separation and reduction, in: Mathematics of Program Construction, 5 th International Conference, LNCS, vol. 1837, Springer-Verlag, July 2000, pp. 45 – 59]. Separation theorems simplify reasoning about distributed systems, where with purely algebraic reasoning they can reduce complicated interleaving behaviour to “separated” behaviours each of which can be analysed on its own. Until now that has not been possible for probabilistic distributed systems. We present two case studies. The first treats a simple voting mechanism in the algebraic style, and the second—based on Rabin’s Mutual exclusion with bounded waiting [Eyal Kushilevitz, M. O. Rabin, Randomized mutual exclusion algorithms revisited, in: Proceedings of the 11 th Annual ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing, 1992, pp. 275 – 283]—is one where verification problems have already occurred: the original presentation [M. O. Rabin, N-process mutual exclusion with bounded waiting by 4 log 2 n-valued shared variable, Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 25 (1) (1982) 66 – 75] was later shown to have subtle flaws [I. Saias, Proving probabilistic correctness statements: the case of Rabin’s algorithm for mutual exclusion, in: Proceedings of the 11 th Annual ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing, 1992]. It motivates our interest in algebras, where assumptions relating probability and secrecy are clearly exposed and, in some cases, can be given simple characterisations in spite of their intricacy. Finally we show how the algebraic proofs for these theorems can be automated using a modification of Aboul-Hosn and Kozen’s KAT-ML [Kamal Aboul-Hosn, Dexter Kozen, KAT-ML: An interactive theorem prover for Kleene algebra with tests, J. Appl. Non-Classical Logics 1 (2006) ]. 22 page(s...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn Formal Methods we use {{mathematical}} {{structures to}} model real systems {{we want to}} build, or to reason about; {{in this paper we}} are concerned principally with game-based models. In an earlier work [Morgan, C. and A. McIver, Cost analysis of games using program logic, in: Proc. of the 8 th Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC 2001), 2001, abstract only: full text available at [13, key MDP 01]. ] we presented an approach to stochastic minimising games based on our logic for probabilistic programs [Morgan, C., A. McIver and K. Seidel, Probabilistic predicate transformers, ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems 18 (1996) 325 – 53, doi. acm. org/ 10. 1145 / 229542. 229547, McIver, A. and C. Morgan, Abstraction, Refinement and Proof for Probabilistic Systems, <b>Technical</b> <b>Monographs</b> in Computer Science, Springer Verlag, New York, 2004]. The contribution here is to extend our logical approach to maximising games. That maximising and minimising are not (simply) duals is due to the use of least fixed-points in both cases, as is normal for iterating programs. (For duality, we would have to use greatest fixed-points in the maximising case.) The significance of that extension is that it makes a further link between the program-logical approach and the more general methods for finding control strategies that “solve” games of this kind, in the sense of giving the player a “recipe” which, if followed, will deliver the theoretically optimal result...|$|R
