5|$|Galvani's friend, Alessandro Volta, {{continued}} {{researching the}} effect and invented the Voltaic pile in 1800. The basic unit of Volta's pile was a simplified galvanic cell, made of plates of copper and zinc separated by an electrolyte and {{connected by a}} conductor externally. The units were stacked in series to make the Voltaic cell, which produced electricity by directing electrons from the zinc to the copper and allowing the zinc <b>to</b> <b>corrode.</b>|$|E
5|$|On March 8, 2013, the {{engineering}} firm NORR, {{commissioned by the}} Ontario Provincial Police, released {{the results of their}} forensic engineering investigation to the Elliot Lake Inquiry. The investigation found that the collapse was caused by a two-stage failure of the welding on a connection, due to extensive corrosion. The corrosion was caused by improper waterproofing and the placement of a parking lot on the roof, which allowed water, contaminated with road salt (which accelerated the corrosion) <b>to</b> <b>corrode</b> the structure.|$|E
5|$|Contamination {{by water}} during filling {{may be due}} to two causes. Inadequate {{filtration}} and drying of the compressed air can introduce small quantities of fresh water condensate, or an emulsion of water and compressor lubricant, and failing to clear the cylinder valve orifice of water which may have dripped from wet dive gear, which can allow contamination by fresh or seawater. Both cause corrosion, but seawater contamination can cause a cylinder <b>to</b> <b>corrode</b> rapidly {{to the extent that it}} may be unsafe or condemned after even a fairly short period. This problem is exacerbated in hot climates, where chemical reactions are faster, and is more prevalent where filling staff are badly trained or overworked.|$|E

25|$|To {{keep the}} main cables tensioned, an {{anchorage}} structure {{on each side}} of the span is placed below the road deck. After 15 years, the cables have no rust.

5|$|Tantalum is inert against most acids except {{hydrofluoric}} acid and hot sulfuric acid, and hot alkaline solutions also cause tantalum <b>to</b> <b>corrode.</b> This property {{makes it a}} useful metal for chemical reaction vessels and pipes for corrosive liquids. Heat exchanging coils for the steam heating of hydrochloric acid are made from tantalum. Tantalum was extensively used {{in the production of}} ultra high frequency electron tubes for radio transmitters. The tantalum is capable of capturing oxygen and nitrogen by forming nitrides and oxides and therefore helps to sustain the high vacuum needed for the tubes.|$|E
5|$|Designed for {{overseas}} service protecting Germany's maritime trade, Hansa {{spent the first}} nine years of her career abroad. In 1884, {{it was found that}} her hull was badly corroded; this stemmed from the lengthy construction period, during which the iron had already begun <b>to</b> <b>corrode.</b> As a result of the poor shape of her hull, Hansa was removed from active service in 1884 and used as a guard ship in Kiel. While in Kiel, she was also used as a training ship for engine-room personnel and stokers. She was formally stricken from the naval register on 6 August 1888. She was then used as a floating barracks in Kiel, until 1905. Hansa was then moved to Mönkeberg, hulked, and used to train stokers. The ship did not last long in this service, and was sold in March 1906 for 96,000marks. Hansa was broken up later that year in Swinemünde.|$|E
5|$|Gerard Bond {{suggests}} {{that changes in}} the flux of solar energy on a 1,500-year scale may be correlated to the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, and in turn the Heinrich events; however the small magnitude {{of the change in}} energy makes such an exo-terrestrial factor unlikely to have the required large effects, at least without huge positive feedback processes acting within the Earth system. However, rather than the warming itself melting the ice, it is possible that sea-level change associated with the warming destabilised ice shelves. A rise in sea level could begin <b>to</b> <b>corrode</b> the bottom of an ice sheet, undercutting it; when one ice sheet failed and surged, the ice released would further raise sea levels, and further destabilizing other ice sheets. In favour of this theory is the non-simultaneity of ice sheet break-up in H1, H2, H4, and H5, where European breakup preceded European melting by up to 1,500years (Maslin et al. 2001).|$|E

5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{task of the}} metallurgists was {{to determine}} how to cast plutonium into a sphere. The difficulties became apparent when attempts to measure the density of plutonium gave inconsistent results. At first contamination was believed to be the cause, but it was soon determined that there were multiple allotropes of plutonium. The brittle α phase that exists at room temperature changes to the plastic β phase at higher temperatures. Attention then shifted to the even more malleable δ phase that normally exists in the 300°C to 450°C range. It was found that this was stable at room temperature when alloyed with aluminum, but aluminum emits neutrons when bombarded with alpha particles, which would exacerbate the pre-ignition problem. The metallurgists then hit upon a plutonium-gallium alloy, which stabilized the δ phase and could be hot pressed into the desired spherical shape. As plutonium was found <b>to</b> <b>corrode</b> readily, the sphere was coated with nickel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} control the grain {{structure}} of K 4169 superalloy blade which affects its mechanical performance and ability of resistance <b>to</b> <b>corroding</b> in high temperature state, the transient temperature field distributions were analyzed by using equivalent thermal entropy method with the consideration of the practical boundary conditions, such as, heat exchange and heat radiation in solidification, and the relationships between temperature and time of every point on vertical section and cross section during phase change heat transference process of K 4169 superalloy were obtained. The changes of solid phase fraction after every time step were calculated basing {{on the model of}} equiaxed dendrite growth solute diffusion put forward by Rappaz and other persons. we used the data to modify the temperature in the same step when phase change latent heat was released. The Cell Automaton technology was adopted to coupled simulate the grain structure formation process of K 4169 superalloy blade with its temperature fields using continuous nucleation model and kinetic model of dendrite tip growth. These simulation results which coincided much well with the ones of experiment test have played a very important role in studying superalloy mechanical performance and ability of resistance <b>to</b> <b>corroding</b> of K 4169 alloy blades...|$|R

25|$|Plating, painting, and the {{application}} of enamel are the most common anti-corrosion treatments. They work by providing a barrier of corrosion-resistant material between the damaging environment and the structural material. Aside from cosmetic and manufacturing issues, there may be tradeoffs in mechanical flexibility versus resistance to abrasion and high temperature. Platings usually fail only in small sections, but if the plating is more noble than the substrate (for example, chromium on steel), a galvanic couple will cause any exposed area <b>to</b> <b>corrode</b> much more rapidly than an unplated surface would. For this reason, it is often wise to plate with active metal such as zinc or cadmium.|$|E
25|$|Hydro{{demolition}} is {{not used}} as much for demolition {{as it is for}} surface restoration and protection projects. When concrete has deteriorated or the reinforcing steel has begun <b>to</b> <b>corrode,</b> it is necessary to remove any unsound concrete and reinforcing bars (rebar) in order to replace it with new concrete and maintain the integrity of the structure. This process has also been used to remove sound concrete that is not compromised in any way. This may be done to install a preventive cathodic protection system, or to remove concrete in structures in which vibration is a concern. Unlike jackhammers, hydrodemolition does not produce vibrations throughout a structure and therefore does not introduce micro fractures.|$|E
25|$|A bacterium, {{known as}} a bioreporter, has been genetically {{engineered}} to fluoresce under ultraviolet light {{in the presence of}} TNT. Tests involving spraying such bacteria over a simulated minefield successfully located mines. In the field, this method could allow for searching hundreds of acres in a few hours, which is much faster than other techniques, and could be used on a variety of terrain types. While there are some false positives (especially near plants and water drainage), even three ounces of TNT were detectable using these bacteria. Unfortunately, there is no strain of bacteria capable of detecting RDX, another common explosive, and the bacteria may not be visible under desert conditions. Also, well-constructed munitions that have not had time <b>to</b> <b>corrode</b> may be undetectable using this method.|$|E

25|$|Part of the {{conversion}} was a {{rehabilitation of the}} building's facade. Since flashing was not originally included around the building's windows, rainwater failed to drain, causing window shelves <b>to</b> <b>corrode</b> and the surrounding masonry to fail. During the rehabilitation, the facade was cleaned and rebuilt and repaired where needed. Along with adding weatherproofing, 97 percent of {{the windows in the}} tower needed replacement. The new windows were originally criticized for being too bright, but the brightness has faded over time. Two-story windows on the 33rd floor needed to be replaced, but the first replacements did not meet historical preservation standards, and a second set had to be designed and were subsequently approved. The large windows in the base were repaired, reglazed and cleaned. The street-level windows were restored to their original appearance based on physical evidence and drawings.|$|E
25|$|The factory was {{not well}} {{equipped}} to handle the gas created by the sudden addition of water to the MIC tank. The MIC tank alarms had not been working {{for four years and}} there was only one manual back-up system, compared to a four-stage system used in the United States. The flare tower and several vent gas scrubbers had been out of service for five months before the disaster. Only one gas scrubber was operating: it could not treat such a large amount of MIC with sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), which would have brought the concentration down to a safe level. The flare tower could only handle a quarter of the gas that leaked in 1984, and moreover it was out of order {{at the time of the}} incident. To reduce energy costs, the refrigeration system was idle. The MIC was kept at 20 degrees Celsius, not the 4.5 degrees advised by the manual. Even the steam boiler, intended to clean the pipes, was non-operational for unknown reasons. Slip-blind plates that would have prevented water from pipes being cleaned from leaking into the MIC tanks, had the valves been faulty, were not installed and their installation had been omitted from the cleaning checklist. As MIC is water-soluble, deluge guns were in place to contain escaping gases from the stack. The water pressure was too weak for the guns to spray high enough to reach the gas which would have reduced the concentration of escaping gas significantly. In addition to it, carbon steel valves were used at the factory, even though they were known <b>to</b> <b>corrode</b> when exposed to acid.|$|E
