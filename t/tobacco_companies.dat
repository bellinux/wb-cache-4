5|$|Even {{though most}} {{consumer}} items {{are in short}} supply in North Korea, there is a considerable variety of cigarettes available. In general, strong tobacco is preferred, and filters are rare. Western brands, particularly American, but also Chinese, Russian and Japanese are popular with the elite and preferred over domestic cigarettes. Foreign cigarettes and the domestic 727 brand, whose name stands for 27 July, the date of the Korean Armistice Agreement, are veritable status symbols. Menthol cigarettes are virtually non-existent, but there is competition among <b>tobacco</b> <b>companies</b> to introduce other attractive products, such as fruit-flavoured balls inside the filter to give the cigarette flavour.|$|E

British American Tobacco also has business in the country, but it has reduced its involvement due to political pressure and public relations reasons.
