(New Hampshire delegates would not join the Convention until more than halfway through the proceedings, on July 23.) James Madison arrived first, and soon most of the Virginia delegation arrived. While waiting for the other delegates, the Virginia delegation produced the Virginia Plan, which was designed and written by James Madison. On May 25, the delegations convened in the Pennsylvania State House.|$|E

5|$|On June 27, {{officials}} {{announced that the}} estimated containment date had been delayed until July 7. According to a Forest Service Spokesman, the final 7% of the perimeter was in extremely rough terrain that was close to impossible for hand crews or bulldozers to reach. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> access the fire remained only 96% contained on July 9 and the estimated containment date was pushed back to July 21. Due to favorable conditions, on July 12, the Sherpa fire was 100% contained ahead of schedule. Because {{of the threat of}} flare ups within the burn area, patrols continued for several days.|$|E

A second shipment was removed around 27 January; that same day, the U.N. Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, expressed concern over the worsening delays and assessed that Syria already has the resources required to transport the weapons promptly despite the ongoing civil war.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} {{anomalous}} units, as mentioned above, {{had not been}} transferred into the new system; these were the two Irish Yeomanry regiments and the Volunteers of Bermuda and the Isle of Man. The decision had been taken to have no Territorial Force units in Ireland and so the two yeomanry regiments were disbanded and reconstituted in the Special Reserve as the North Irish Horse and South Irish Horse. The Isle of Man Volunteers and Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps remained organised as Volunteers; whilst the new legislation did extend to the Isle of Man, the force was not reorganised there partly due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> changing to annual training. Bermuda, the Channel Islands and Malta were not encompassed by {{the scope of the}} legislation, and so the Militia there continued to operate under the old system.|$|E

5|$|Almost There is {{the first}} major-label studio album by American Christian rock band MercyMe. Produced by Pete Kipley, the album was {{released}} on August 14, 2001 by INO Records. After releasing six independent records, the band decided to pursue a record contract due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> selling, booking, and managing for themselves. The band signed with the newly formed INO Records, and were assigned to work with Kipley, who had not produced a major project before. Four of the songs on the album had previously appeared on the band's independent records; the rest were newly recorded songs. The album is a worship and pop rock album, and adopts a more radio-friendly sound than the band's independent albums.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the Independence Bowl, the game {{received}} as much or more coverage than the incipient national championship game due to the controversial status of Tech star Bruce Smith, who was embroiled in a legal battle with the NCAA about his participation in the game.

Ticket sales were slow in the {{weeks leading up}} to the bowl, and Virginia Tech was faulted for failing to sell its entire allotment of 12,000 tickets.

5|$|Morgan's {{department}} always faced financial {{struggles in}} an era before much federal research funding was available. To raise funds, Morgan provided food service educational courses to teachers, nurses and other participants. These classes ultimately weakened the department's reputation at the university, as school officials viewed the training as vocational and considered it to be beneath {{the standards of the}} university. Because of this, Morgan was prohibited from accepting industry funding for research and the university provided her with very little space to conduct her research work. Adding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> the situation was the fact that university officials had previously criticized Morgan for maintaining academic standards that were too high for a home economics program.|$|E

5|$|The Ottoman Empire's {{early years}} {{have been the subject}} of varying {{narratives}} due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> discerning fact from legend. The empire came into existence at the end of the thirteenth century, and its first ruler (and the namesake of the Empire) was Osman I. According to later, often unreliable Ottoman tradition, Osman was a descendant of the Kayı tribe of the Oghuz Turks. The eponymous Ottoman dynasty he founded endured for six centuries through the reigns of 36 sultans. The Ottoman Empire disappeared as a result of the defeat of the Central Powers with whom it had allied itself during World War I. The partitioning of the Empire by the victorious Allies and the ensuing Turkish War of Independence led to the abolition of the sultanate in 1922 and the birth of the modern Republic of Turkey in 1922.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} in the Adriatic has been credited with having {{a significant effect on}} the wider war through the disruption of French forces in the Balkans. It has been suggested that Napoleon intended to invade the Ottoman Empire following the War of the Fifth Coalition, but was dissuaded in part due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> supplying a force in the region without control of the Adriatic, his attention eventually turning to Russia. The campaign also had effects on the morale and effectiveness of the French fleet, which lost some of its best commanders and frigates in the campaign, and on the Austrian advance on Italy in 1813, when French defence lines were repeatedly out-flanked by British attacks from the sea.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{plan called}} for a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, at 121:28 mission elapsed time. On the {{original}} plan, {{this would have been}} at 7:44 UTC on September 4, 1983, before accounting for the last-minute launch delay; in the event, this was put back by one day to allow for further communications testing, and Challenger touched down at 07:40:33 UTC (00:40:33 PDT), September 5, 1983, on Runway 22 at Edwards AFB, {{on the morning of the}} seventh day of the mission. As with the launch, this was the first night landing of the program. The Shuttle orbiters had no on-board lights, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> designing landing lights to survive re-entry, and so the runway was lit by high-intensity xenon arc lamps to guide the orbiter in. There was no pressing operational requirement for a night landing, but there was a desire to prove it was possible. Footage of the landing was shown in the 1986 film SpaceCamp.|$|E

5|$|Elephants were {{historically}} {{kept for}} {{display in the}} menageries of Ancient Egypt, China, Greece, and Rome. The Romans in particular pitted them against humans and other animals in gladiator events. In the modern era, elephants have traditionally been {{a major part of}} zoos and circuses around the world. In circuses, they are trained to perform tricks. The most famous circus elephant was probably Jumbo (1861 – 15 September 1885), who was a major attraction in the Barnum & Bailey Circus. These animals do not reproduce well in captivity, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> handling musth bulls and limited understanding of female oestrous cycles. Asian elephants were always more common than their African counterparts in modern zoos and circuses. After CITES listed the Asian elephant under Appendix I in 1975, the number of African elephants in zoos increased in the 1980s, although the import of Asians continued. Subsequently, the US received many of its captive African elephants from Zimbabwe, which had an overabundance of the animals. As of 2000, around 1,200 Asian and 700 African elephants were kept in zoos and circuses. The largest captive population is in North America, which has an estimated 370 Asian and 350 African elephants. About 380 Asians and 190 Africans are known to exist in Europe, and Japan has around 70 Asians and 67 Africans.|$|E
5|$|Japan's air {{defenses}} {{were unable to}} stop the Allied air attacks. Owing to the short range of the country's land-based radar, and Allied attacks on IJN picket ships, the defenders typically had only about an hour to respond to incoming B-29s once they had been detected. Japanese signals intelligence units could provide longer warning times of incoming raids by eavesdropping on the bombers' radio communications, but were unable to predict {{the target of the}} attack. As a result, fighter units did not have enough time to scramble and reach the bombers' cruising altitude before they arrived over their target, and most raids were intercepted by only small numbers of aircraft. Moreover, the American bombers were capable of flying faster at high altitude than many Japanese fighters. Even when the fighters managed to close within gun range, the well-built B-29s were often able to sustain large amounts of damage. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> intercepting and downing B-29s, the Japanese fighter pilots increasingly perceived their efforts as being futile. From August 1944 Japanese aircraft occasionally conducted suicide ramming attacks on B-29s, and several specialized kamikaze fighter units were established in October; {{by the end of the}} war, ramming tactics had destroyed nine B-29s and damaged another 13 for the loss of 21 fighters.|$|E
5|$|Montejo {{followed}} up on the victory at Cerquín by sending two companies of soldiers to the Comayagua valley, {{under the command of}} Xuárez de Ávila and Alonso de Reinoso. He sent more soldiers into the mountainous regions around San Pedro, and personally commanded forays around Gracias a Dios to eliminate any isolated pockets of resistance there. The campaign in the Comayagua valley proved difficult; the Spanish were hindered by the broken terrain, while the natives were still determined to resist and had established fortified mountaintops in a similar fashion to the Peñol de Cerquín. In spite of supplies provided by Montejo, food was scarce, and it was difficult to replenish their stocks locally in the face of native hostility. The Indians launched fierce assaults from their fortresses, then would retreat to their mountain-tops, raining showers of arrows and boulders upon the attacking Spanish. Cavalry were nearly useless in the difficult terrain, and the Spanish were forced to resort to foot soldiers supported by light artillery. In response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> the campaign, the two Spanish expeditions under Xúarez and Reinoso joined into a combined force. Cáceres had now returned to Gracias from the Peñol de Cerquín, so Montejo sent him to Comayagua with a strong detachment of soldiers and plentiful supplies. Although the campaign in the Comayagua valley drew on into 1538 without a decisive victory, the Spanish were able to reestablish the town of Santa María de Comayagua.|$|E

5|$|While most ants have poor eyesight, Myrmecia ants have {{excellent}} vision. This trait {{is important to}} them, since Myrmecia primarily relies on visual cues for navigation. These ants are capable of discriminating the distance and size of objects moving nearly a metre away. Winged alates are only active during the day, as they can see better. Members of a colony have different eye structures due to each individual fulfilling different tasks, and nocturnal species have larger ommatidia in comparison to those that are active during the day. Facet lenses also vary in size; for example, the diurnal species M. croslandi has a smaller lens in comparison to M. nigriceps and M. pyriformis which have larger lenses. Myrmecia ants have three photoreceptors that can see UV light, meaning {{they are capable of}} seeing colours that humans cannot. Their vision is said to be better than some mammals, such as cats, dogs or wallabies. Despite their excellent vision, worker ants of this genus find it difficult to find their nests at night, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> finding the landmarks they use to navigate. They are thus more likely to return to their nests the following morning, walking slowly with long pauses.|$|E
