5|$|On June7, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration raised Public Storm Signal No. 1 {{for most}} of Luzon. As Conson {{strengthened}} into a typhoon, northern areas of Luzon were placed under Public Storm Signal No. 3, resulting in school closures. As the typhoon passed by the Philippines, it dropped heavy rains, peaking at 333.8mm (13.1in) in Iba. The highest 24‑hour rainfall was recorded in Subic Bay at 230mm (9in). Minor flooding and power outages were reported in Manila. These heavy rains led to flooding which reportedly killed 30 people in Luzon.

25|$|Why {{is it that}} we {{are sure}} a {{particular}} activity — e.g. Olympic target shooting — is a game while a similar activity — e.g. military sharp shooting — is not? Wittgenstein's explanation is tied up with an important analogy. How do we recognize <b>that</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> we know are related to one another? We may see similar height, weight, eye color, hair, nose, mouth, patterns of speech, social or political views, mannerisms, body structure, last names, etc. If we see enough matches we say we've noticed a family resemblance. It is perhaps important to note that this is not always a conscious process — generally we don't catalog various similarities until we reach a certain threshold, we just intuitively see the resemblances. Wittgenstein suggests that {{the same is true of}} language. We are all familiar (i.e. socially) with enough things which are games and enough things which are not games that we can categorize new activities as either games or not.|$|E
